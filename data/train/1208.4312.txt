    "while the work of gu and zhu @xcite establishes the existence of ricci flow solutions that form type - ii singularities , it tells us very little regarding the details of the evolving geometries of such solutions .",
    "the numerical work of garfinkle with one of the authors @xcite , together with the formal matched asymptotics derived by all three authors @xcite , strongly suggest what some of these details might be , at least for those solutions @xmath3 that are rotationally symmetric and involve a degenerate neckpinch . however , these works do not prove that solutions with the prescribed behavior exist . in the present work , we prove that indeed , for each of the prescribed models of the evolving geometry near the singularity discussed in our work on matched asymptotics @xcite , there is a ricci flow solution that asymptotically approaches this model . specifically , we prove the main conjecture stated in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "it follows from the results proved here and stated below that in every dimension @xmath4 and for each integer @xmath5 , there is a ricci flow solution that develops a degenerate neckpinch singularity with the characteristic profile ( locally ) of a bryant soliton , and with the rate of curvature blowup given by @xmath6 for @xmath7 approaching the singularity time @xmath8 , and for some constant @xmath9 .    in determining that there exist ricci flow solutions that form type - ii singularities , gu and zhu @xcite show that there are solutions in which the curvature of the evolving metrics satisfies @xmath10 . their work does not , however , determine the specific rate of curvature blowup in these solutions .",
    "enders @xcite has defined _ type - a _ singularities as those with curvature blowing up at the rate @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , and has questioned whether there are any compact solutions outside this class .",
    "our work shows that indeed there are : as noted above , we prove that there exist solutions with curvature blowing up at the rate @xmath2 for all positive integers @xmath13 ; all but the @xmath14 solutions fall outside enders type - a class of solutions .",
    "noting the existence of solutions with these discrete curvature blowup rates , we are led to ask if there exist ( compact ) solutions  degenerate neckpinch or otherwise  that exhibit blowup rates other than these discrete values . our work does not shed light on this question .",
    "we do note that for two - dimensional ricci flow , in which case the flow is conformal and the conformal factor evolves by logarithmic fast diffusion , @xmath15 , daskalopoulos and hamilton @xcite prove that there exist complete noncompact solutions that form singularities at the rate @xmath16 .    the class of metrics we consider in this work are @xmath17-invariant riemannian metrics on the sphere @xmath18 .",
    "we work with ricci flow solutions @xmath19 for such initial data , and focus on solutions that develop a singularity at one or both of the poles at finite time @xmath20 ( proving that such solutions do exist ) . to define what it means for a singularity to be a neckpinch",
    ", we recall that a sequence @xmath21 of points and times in a ricci flow solution is called a _ blow - up sequence _ at time @xmath20 if @xmath22 and if @xmath23 as @xmath24 ; such a sequence has a corresponding _ pointed singularity model _ if the sequence of parabolic dilation metrics latexmath:[$g_j(x , t):= |\\operatorname{rm}(x_j , t_j)|\\,g\\big(x , t_j+    we say that a ricci flow solution develops a _",
    "neckpinch singularity _ at time @xmath20 if there is some blow - up sequence at @xmath20 whose corresponding pointed singularity model exists and is given by the self - similarly shrinking ricci soliton on the cylinder @xmath26 .",
    "we call a neckpinch singularity _ nondegenerate",
    "_ if every pointed singularity model of any blowup sequence corresponding to @xmath20 is a cylindrical solution , and we call it _ degenerate _ if there is at least one blowup sequence at @xmath20 with a pointed singularity model that is not a cylindrical solution .",
    "rotationally symmetric nondegenerate neckpinches have been studied extensively by simon @xcite and by two of the authors @xcite . in the latter works",
    ", it is shown that there is an open set of ( rotationally symmetric ) compact initial manifolds whose ricci flows develop nondegenerate neckpinch singularities , all of which are type - i in the sense that @xmath27 .",
    "further , in the presence of reflection symmetry , @xcite provides a detailed set of models for the asymptotic behavior of the geometry near a developing nondegenerate neckpinch , with those models collectively serving as attractors for these flows .    unlike the formation of nondegenerate neckpinches , the formation of degenerate neckpinches in ricci flow is expected to be an unstable property",
    "this is evident in @xcite as well as in @xcite : in all three of these works , one studies flows that develop degenerate neckpinches by considering one - parameter families of initial data such that for all values of the parameter above a threshold value , the ricci flow solutions develop nondegenerate neckpinches , while for all parameter values below that value , there is no neckpinch singularity .",
    "the flows with initial data _ at _ the threshold value of the parameter are the ones that develop degenerate neckpinches .",
    "this instability leads us to use the somewhat indirect _",
    "waewski retraction method _",
    "@xcite to explore the asymptotic behavior of the geometry near these degenerate neckpinches as they form .",
    "we discuss this in detail below .",
    "the matched asymptotics derived in @xcite rely heavily on the imposition of a series of _ ansatz _ conditions to characterize the formal solutions of interest .",
    "( it is through these _ ansatz _ conditions that one builds the formation of degenerate neckpinches into the formal solutions . )",
    "by contrast , no such _ a priori _ assumptions are needed ( or used ) in the present work .",
    "rather , having determined in @xcite the nature and the explicit approximate forms ( in regions near the degenerate neckpinch ) for our formal solutions , we show here without imposing any further assumptions that there exist ricci flow solutions that approach each of the formal solutions .",
    "it follows that degenerate neckpinches form in these ricci flow solutions .",
    "each of the solutions we consider here is characterized by an integer @xmath28 . as our results show , there is at least a one - parameter family of solutions corresponding to each value of @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , our construction in section  [ initialdata ] below reveals that degenerate neckpinches form in solutions starting from a set of initial data of codimension-@xmath29 in the space of @xmath17-invariant solutions . besides determining the rate of curvature blowup",
    ", the integer @xmath29 also characterizes to an extent the detailed asymptotic behavior of the solution in a neighborhood of the singularity . while we discuss the details of this characterization below ( in section  [ sec : form - asympt - again ] ) , we note here one important feature that depends only on the parity of @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath29 is even , then the solution is reflection symmetric across the equator , neckpinch singularities occur simultaneously at both poles , and the volume of @xmath3 approaches zero at the time of the singularity . if on the other hand @xmath29 is odd , then the neckpinch occurs at one pole only , and the volume of @xmath3 remains positive at the time of the singularity .",
    "we note that in either case , for @xmath30 , the curvature has local maxima both at one of the poles and at a nearby latitude sphere @xmath31 where the neck is maximally pinched . as @xmath7 approaches the singular time @xmath20 , the distance between the neckpinch sphere and the pole approaches zero , and the curvature becomes infinite simultaneously ( albeit at different rates ) both at the neckpinch sphere and at the pole .",
    "a detailed statement of our main results depends on the details of the asymptotic behavior of the formal model solutions . referring to our discussion of this behavior below in section  [ sec : form - asympt - again ] ,",
    "we can state our main theorem as follows :    for every integer @xmath0 and every real number @xmath32 , there exist rotationally symmetric ricci flow solutions @xmath3 in each dimension @xmath33 that develop degenerate neckpinch singularities at @xmath8 . for each choice of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "the corresponding solutions have distinct asymptotic behavior .    in each case , the singularity is type - ii  slowly forming  with @xmath36 attained at a pole , where @xmath37 .    rescaling a solution corresponding to @xmath38 so that the distance from the pole dilates at the type - ii rate @xmath39",
    ", one finds that the metric converges uniformly on intervals of order @xmath40 to the steady bryant soliton .",
    "rescaling any solution so that the distance from the smallest neck dilates at the parabolic rate @xmath41 , one finds that the metric converges uniformly on intervals of order @xmath42 to the shrinking cylinder soliton .",
    "furthermore , the solutions exhibit the precise asymptotic behavior summarized in section  [ sec : form - asympt - again ] , and they satisfy the estimates summarized in section  [ outline ] .",
    "since the formal model solutions play a major role in this work , after setting up the needed coordinates and metric representations for our analysis in section  [ choosecoordinateswisely ] , we carefully review the nature of these formal solutions and their matched asymptotic expansions in considerable detail in section  [ sec : form - asympt - again ] .",
    "while the formal solutions we discuss here are the same as those analyzed in @xcite , we note that here we use somewhat altered coordinate representations in certain regions near the pole . in section  [ structure ] , we describe the general structure of the proof of the main theorem and outline its key steps .",
    "the technical work to carry out these steps is detailed in sections  [ puttingupbarriers][initialdata ] .",
    "as noted above , in this paper we study @xmath43-invariant metrics @xmath44 evolving by ricci flow on @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] for initial data @xmath47 .",
    "each such metric may be identified with functions @xmath48 via @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the canonical round unit - radius metric on @xmath31 .",

    "the quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 evolve by @xmath54 respectively .",

    "below , we remedy this by suitable choices of gauge .",

    "we next define initial data locally using coordinates adapted to the parabolic region of the formal solution , since it is in this region where the restrictions stated above are most critical . working with the metric variables and",
    "coordinates discussed in section  [ paraboliccoordinates ] , and recalling that @xmath773 and @xmath32 are fixed , we see that for every set of @xmath29 constants @xmath774,\\qquad 0\\leq j \\leq k-1,\\ ] ] ( with @xmath775 and @xmath776 small positive constants to be determined below ) , if we write @xmath777 and if in addition we set @xmath778 , then a metric @xmath779 is determined locally .",
    "it is clear that one can choose @xmath780 small enough such that the corresponding metrics are as close as desired in the @xmath104 topology to the approximate solution @xmath781 in the region @xmath782 .",
    "closeness to @xmath783 in that same region then follows .    with an eye toward conditions  and , we choose @xmath780 so that the sharp inequalities @xmath784 hold for @xmath785 , with @xmath786 holding on the boundary , which ensures by lemma  [ exitlemma ] that solutions originating from initial data on the boundary of the topological ball @xmath787 $ ] immediately exit @xmath199 . we verify that in choosing @xmath775 and @xmath776 as indicated , the conditions for these initial data to lie within the tube ( at least for the portion of the metrics pertaining to the parabolic region ) are satisfied .",
    "we may assume that @xmath273 is small enough , hence that @xmath780 are small enough , so that the @xmath104 condition in is satisfied .",
    "combined with the second inequality above , this ensures that the initial data constructed here belong to @xmath740 . in turn , by lemma  [ pwentrapment ] , this ensures that the data satisfy .",
    "we next obtain globally defined initial data in @xmath788 by using cutoff functions to smoothly glue the metric @xmath779 defined locally above to the formal solution in the intermediate and tip regions , and ( for @xmath29 odd ) to that portion of the manifold which remains nonsingular .",
    "more specifically , we proceed as follows .    for @xmath789",
    ", the construction above ensures that @xmath790 is as close as desired to its value in the formal solution  , namely @xmath791 in particular , making @xmath273 smaller if necessary , we can ensure that each initial datum lies between the barriers @xmath384 constructed in lemma  [ orderintermediate ] for all @xmath108 where both it and the barriers are defined .",
    "one may thus extend the solution by means of a cutoff function , obtaining @xmath792 with the properties that @xmath793 at @xmath794 and @xmath795 for all @xmath796 .",
    "here we use the fact that @xmath797 smoothly extends to @xmath346 using the construction in section  [ approximate - sol - at - tip ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath797 lies between the barriers constructed in lemma  [ ordertip ] .",
    "if @xmath29 is odd and @xmath798 , we again find that each initial datum @xmath792 is as close as desired to the formal solution @xmath799 hence lies between the barriers @xmath800 constructed in lemma  [ orderouter ] .",
    "so we again extend @xmath792 by means of a cutoff function until @xmath801 , namely @xmath802 .",
    "there we smoothly glue on a smooth punctured sphere as in section  8.2 of @xcite .",
    "we omit further details ."
