    "classical hamiltonian motion can appear irreversible , as is most familiar for many - body systems but also observed for chaos of two degrees of freedom .",
    "effective irreversibility can show up as relaxation of certain correlation functions , and the decay rates involved are resonances of the propagator for phase - space densities known as the frobenius - perron operator .",
    "frobenius - perron resonances have recently been shown to play a key role for the interrelations of classical , semiclassical and quantum dynamics , e.g. in a superanalytic approach to universal fluctuations in quantum ( quasi- ) energy spectra @xcite.the purpose of this paper is to substantiate those interrelations .",
    "a quantum analog to the frobenius - perron operator is the propagator for husimi functions .",
    "husimi functions are positive and normalized distributions in phase space and turn into phase - space densities in the classical limit .",
    "both classical densities and husimi functions can be approximated within the same hilbert space of phase - space functions . as a caveat we remark here that in the quantum case this hilbert space of phase - space functions is not to be confused with the hilbert space of quantum wave functions .",
    "even though without coupling to external reservoirs both the classical and the quantum dynamics are reversible , both do appear effectively irreversible when phase - space structures can not be fully resolved . since any measurement of phase - space variables can be conducted with finite precision only , restricted phase - space resolution is rather ubiquitous in the macroworld ; in particular for classical chaotic dynamics , where phase - space structures extend over an infinite hierarchy of scales , but also in the quantum case , if a planck cell is too small to be resolved .    by adopting finite phase - space resolution much coarser than a planck cell for a prototypical dynamics",
    "we show that the quantum propagator becomes indistinguishable from the classical propagator .",
    "in particular , we find that resonances of the two propagators coincide , indicating that the same `` relaxation processes '' occur in classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "these processes and thus the resonances can be linked to the resolved structures in phase space @xcite . in particular , in as much as resonances are related to localized structures in phase space , our results suggest that resonances may cause some quantum eigenfunctions to assign exceptional weight to certain regions in phase or configuration space and possibly be one of the origins of scarring .",
    "this line of thought will be taken up in a separate paper .",
    "if the classical phase space displays a mix of regular and chaotic structures , along with effective irreversible behavior caused by hyperbolicity , we also encounter recurrences due to elliptic islands in phase space ; the latter manifest themselves as ( almost ) unimodular eigenvalues of the frobenius - perron and husimi propagators .",
    "as a prototypical hamiltonian system with a mixed phase space we consider a periodically kicked angular momentum vector @xmath0 of conserved length @xmath1 , also known as the kicked top .",
    "such a system has one degree of freedom , and its phase space is the sphere , with the `` azimuthal '' angle @xmath2 as the coordinate and the cosine of the `` polar '' angle @xmath3 as the conjugate momentum .",
    "the dynamics is specified as a stroboscopic area - preserving map @xmath4 on phase space .",
    "we choose the dynamics to consist of rotations @xmath5 about the @xmath6 and @xmath7axes by angles @xmath8 , @xmath9 and a `` torsion '' , i.e. a nonlinear rotation @xmath10 about the @xmath7axis which changes @xmath2 by @xmath11 , @xmath12 with @xmath9 and @xmath8 fixed , we can control the degree of chaoticity of the dynamics by varying @xmath13 . while the dynamics is integrable for @xmath14 , with increasing @xmath13 chaoticity sets in , until for @xmath15 elliptic islands have become so small that they are difficult to detect .    in the liouville picture the time evolution of a phase - space density @xmath16",
    "is governed by liouville s equation , @xmath17 where the liouville operator @xmath18 , the poisson bracket with the hamiltonian @xmath19 , appears as the generator . for our rotations and torsion on the sphere we must separately take @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . denoting the corresponding liouvillians by @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 we imagine liouville s equation for each of them separately integrated over a unit time span .",
    "the product of the resulting three propagators yields the frobenius - perron operator @xmath25 .",
    "while a phase - space density is usually considered as @xmath26integrable , it can be assumed to belong to a hilbert space of @xmath27functions as well . in this hilbert space",
    "@xmath28 is represented by an infinite dimensional unitary matrix .",
    "accordingly its spectrum is unimodular and , depending on the character of the dynamics , may consist of both discrete eigenvalues and continuous parts . the complete basis to represent the matrix in",
    "may be chosen as ordered with respect to phase - space resolution , to eventually allow for a truncation of @xmath28 to finite size in a systematic manner .    on the unit",
    "sphere the spherical harmonics @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 form a suitable basis . employing that represenation resonances were identified in ref .",
    "we here briefly review those results that are of relevance for our present discussion .",
    "phase - space resolution is characterized by the index @xmath32 : by using all @xmath33 with @xmath34 phase - space structure of area @xmath35 can be resolved .",
    "our classical liouvillians can be written in terms of the differential operators @xmath36 well known from quantum mechanical contexts in the @xmath33 representation , @xmath37 the frobenius - perron operator of the @xmath7rotation becomes the matrix @xmath38 which is diagonal in both indices .",
    "the frobenius - perron matrix of the @xmath6rotation is blockdiagonal ( diagonal in @xmath32 but not in @xmath39 ) and consists of the wigner d - matrices well known from quantum mechanics as @xmath40 finally , for the @xmath7torsion the frobenius - perron matrix elements are finite sums over products of spherical bessel functions @xmath41 and clebsch - gordan coefficients , @xmath42 while both rotation matrices are diagonal in the indices @xmath43 , the torsion matrix @xmath44 is diagonal in @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the elements of the frobenius - perron matrix for the composite dynamics are the products @xmath46 and no infinite sum hinders their evaluation .",
    "in the quantum mechanical description of the kicked top a wave vector @xmath47 is propagated by a floquet operator @xmath48 as @xmath49 over one period in between two kicks . again",
    "@xmath50 consists of rotation and torsion operators that are built of components of an angular momentum vector @xmath51 @xcite as @xmath52 an obvious choice for the basis of the hilbert space of wave functions are the @xmath53 eigenvectors of @xmath54 , @xmath55 with fixed @xmath1 and @xmath56 . while @xmath57 and @xmath58 are diagonal matrices in this representation , @xmath59 is again given by the wigner d - matrix @xmath60 .",
    "once again we would like to emphasize that the hilbert space of quantum wave functions must not be confused with the hilbert space of functions on the classical phase space employed in sec.ii .",
    "( the distinction between the two hilbert spaces becomes especially important when one associates , for integer values of @xmath1 , the vectors @xmath61 with the spherical harmonics @xmath62 and the components of @xmath63 with differential operators . )    as the quantum mechanical analogue to classical phase - space densities and the frobenius - perron operator we consider husimi functions and their propagator .",
    "a husimi function turns into a classical density in the classical limit .",
    "the husimi function @xmath64 of a density operator @xmath16 is obtained as its diagonal matrix element with respect to a coherent state @xcite .",
    "coherent states @xmath65 on the sphere assign to the observable @xmath63 a direction characterized by the angles @xmath3 and @xmath2 , but contrary to the classical description that direction is only specified up to the minimum uncertainty permitted by the angular momentum commutation relations .",
    "the relative variance @xmath66 vanishes as the effective planck constant @xmath67 goes to zero in the classical limit .",
    "any coherent state @xmath65 can be obtained via a rotation @xmath68 from the coherent state @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "the husimi function thus reads @xmath71 it can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics , @xmath72 with the index @xmath32 limited to @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the finiteness of the latter expansion will be commented on presently .    as a consequence ,",
    "contrary to classical densities , @xmath64 can be represented as a finite - dimensional vector with the dimension set by the effective ( inverse ) planck constant @xmath1 as @xmath74 .",
    "since no structures smaller than a planck cell can be resolved , the husimi propagator should be expected to be a finite matrix .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath64 is governed by von neumann s equation @xmath75 | j   \\theta \\varphi \\rangle \\ ,   \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] with @xmath76 and @xmath77 for torsion and rotations , respectively . in the representation ( [ eq16 ] ) the generators @xmath78 can be written as differential operators very similar in structure to the classical liouvillians ( [ eq8 ] ) as ( see appendix a ) @xmath79 it is seen that the quantum husimi generators @xmath78 and the classical liouvillians @xmath18 are identical for rotations , while for the @xmath7torsion a quantum correction arises in @xmath80 , which is formally of order @xmath81 .",
    "this correction is responsible for all the difference between classical and quantum mechanics in the sequel .",
    "we should point out here that the correction in question ensures the finite range of the husimi matrix mentioned before , @xmath73 , @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast to the rotations , the torsion couples different angular momenta @xmath32 . the action of the torsion generator on the spherical harmonics is calculated in appendix b as @xmath83 the generator couples spherical harmonics of neighbouring @xmath32 , except for the cases @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where the prefactors of @xmath86 and @xmath87 vanish , respectively .",
    "it follows from the foregoing remarks on the husimi generator that the husimi propagators @xmath88 , @xmath89 for rotations are identical to their frobenius - perron correspondents . however , the torsion propagator @xmath90 still has to be determined",
    ". clearly , the @xmath74 `` husimi functions '' @xmath91 @xmath92 are eigenfunctions of @xmath90 with eigenvalues @xmath93 .",
    "note that the @xmath94 represents the skew ket - bras @xmath95 in the sense of the definition ( [ eq15 ] ) . in order to proceed to representing @xmath90 in the basis @xmath96",
    "we have constructed the linear transformation relating the spherical harmonics @xmath33 to the `` husimi functions '' @xmath94 ( see appendix c ) . like",
    "its classical counterpart @xmath97 ( see ( [ eq11 ] ) ) the husimi propagator for @xmath98-torsion , @xmath90 , turns out diagonal in @xmath39 but not in @xmath32 . as a consequence ,",
    "the husimi matrix elements are simple products of torsion and rotation matrix elements , @xmath99",
    "as has been illustrated for the kicked top in two previous papers @xcite , resonances and eigenvalues of the frobenius - perron operator as well as the associated phase - space structures can be found when time evolution is looked upon with finite resolution .",
    "however , since our aim is to compare classical and quantum dynamics at limited phase - space resolution , we briefly summarize the results . in representations with respect to the resolution - ordered basis functions",
    "@xmath33 with @xmath100 and integer @xmath31 , a limitation of phase - space resolution is achieved by a simple truncation , discarding all matrix elements of @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "the resulting @xmath103 matrix @xmath104 of dimension @xmath105 is a nonunitary approximation to the unitary @xmath28 with a purely discrete spectrum bounded in modulus by unity .",
    "an investigation of the @xmath106dependence of the eigenvalues of @xmath104 reveals that with increasing resolution some eigenvalues persist in their positions , either close to or well inside the unit circle . of these",
    "`` frozen '' eigenvalues the almost unimodular ones turn into unimodular eigenvalues of the unitary @xmath28 as @xmath107 ; the subunimodular eigenvalues reflect resonances of @xmath28 in a higher riemannian sheet .",
    "the different nature of `` frozen '' unimodular and subunimodular eigenvalues becomes more evident through an investigation of their eigenfunctions . for unimodular eigenvalues",
    "the eigenfunctions are sharply localized on islands of regular motion surrounding elliptic periodic orbits , while for subunimodular eigenvalues eigenfunctions are localized around unstable manifolds of hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "the condition for freezing of an eigenvalue evidently is that at least the largest associated phase - space structures are resolved . for the kicked top with @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110",
    "we propose to illustrate the freezing of eigenvalues .",
    "as no elliptic structures can be resolved even at the highest employed resolution , @xmath111 , all frozen eigenvalues except for the one at unity ( pertaining to the stationary constant eigenfunction @xmath112 ) lie well inside the unit circle .",
    "a gray - scale histogram of all eigenvalues with moduli greater than @xmath113 of all matrices @xmath104 with @xmath114 in the complex plane is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "eigenvalues of smaller modulus have been rejected , since they have not settled yet and would spoil the histogram due to their large density near the origin .",
    "dark areas in the histogram indicate large amplitudes and thus the positions of `` frozen '' eigenvalues . several nonunimodular `` frozen '' eigenvalues are clearly visible .",
    "their precise positions at resolutions @xmath115 and @xmath116 are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the smallest scale in phase space resolvable in husimi functions is set by planck s constant . recalling that for the kicked top the role of the inverse planck constant",
    "is played by @xmath1 , in the hilbert space spanned by the @xmath33 the husimi propagator can be represented as a finite @xmath103 matrix of dimension @xmath117 .",
    "this is because with respect to the basis functions @xmath33 all matrix elements of @xmath118 involving indices @xmath119 vanish .",
    "the @xmath74 discrete eigenvalues of @xmath118 are of unit modulus due to the unitarity of schrdinger s time evolution which also implies conservation of probability in phase space . with the eigenvalue problem for the floquet operator @xmath120 solved ,",
    "the eigenphases of the full @xmath118 are the quasienergy differences @xmath121 and the associated eigenfunctions follow as @xmath122 .",
    "we truncate the propagator @xmath118 in the same manner as the frobenius - perron matrix , with the resolution parameter @xmath123 taking a value @xmath124 . now",
    "the dependence of the eigenvalues on the truncation parameter @xmath123 can be studied .",
    "we are particularly interested in semiclassical propagators , i.e. large values of @xmath1 . introducing the ratio @xmath125",
    ", @xmath126 represents complete resolution and @xmath127 the limit with planck cells far from resolved .    starting from @xmath128 and slowly decreasing @xmath129",
    ", the eigenvalues of @xmath118 feel the truncation as a small perturbation at first that slightly shifts them inside the unit circle . with a further decrease of @xmath129",
    ", eigenvalues are spread over the entire unit disk .",
    "when @xmath129 finally becomes small , the eigenvalues of the truncated propagator matrix coincide with the eigenvalues of the corresponding frobenius - perron matrix @xmath104 of the same dimension .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ figure4 ] , where the husimi eigenvalues of the kicked top with @xmath108 , @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 are compared to the eigenvalues of the frobenius - perron matrix at @xmath133 .",
    "for the sake of the comparison we kept @xmath134 fixed also for the quantum propagator and changed @xmath129 by choosing different quantum numbers @xmath135 .",
    "as the most striking aspect of the spectral coincidence at small @xmath129 , resonances as well as eigenvalues of the full frobenius - perron operator can be obtained from quantum dynamics by looking for frozen eigenvalues of the truncated husimi propagator at different values @xmath123 in the limit @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore , the coincidence of eigenvalues implies that also the associated eigenfunctions are in agreement . in particular , the eigenfunctions of the truncated husimi propagator display the same strong scarring on unstable manifolds and elliptic islands in phase space as their classical counterparts .    the most drastic difference between the two propagator matrices lies , of course , in the finiteness of the quantum propagator",
    "moreover , the matrix elements with @xmath32 near the quantum cutoff @xmath136 differ appreciably : it is illustrated in appendix b that the quantum correction of the torsion generator in the basis of spherical harmonics is of the order @xmath137 relative to the classical part . on the other hand , on large phase - space scales , i.e. for @xmath138 , the frobenius - perron and husimi propagators become indistinguishable as @xmath139 .",
    "an expansion of the husimi propagator in powers of @xmath81 yields @xmath140 assuming @xmath123 fixed , for @xmath141 the quantum correction of a matrix element decays as @xmath142 .",
    "accordingly , in this case we expect the mean squared deviation between the matrix elements of the two propagators to asymptotically vanish as @xmath143 .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] confirms that expectation .",
    "in conclusion , for a prototypical dynamical system we have formulated time evolution in terms of phase - space distributions , both classically and quantum mechanically .",
    "the comparison of the two respective propagators at limited phase - space resolution unveils the classical character of the quantum dynamics on large phase - space scales .",
    "only when quantum coherences on the scale of planck s constant are resolved , the peculiarities of quantum mechanics arise . due to this fact",
    "frobenius - perron resonances can be identified from the quantum propagator . moreover ,",
    "quantum propagation is described by a finite matrix and therefore more easily treated than the classical counterpart which is an infinite matrix .",
    "our results on classical and quantum signatures of resonances might become helpful in explaining phase - space localization ( scars ) of quantum eigenfunctions .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support by the sonderforschungsbereich ` unordnung und groe fluktuationen ' of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and support of the minerva foundation .",
