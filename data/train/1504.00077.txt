    "despite its extreme low - density , a void exhibits a dilute miniature of the cosmic web that interconnects the void galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the anisotropic spatial correlation of the tidal shear field is believed to be mainly responsible for the formation of the mini - web in a void just as it is for the cosmic web in the whole universe @xcite .",
    "as the tidal shear field develops nonlinear correlations during the evolutionary process , the mini - web in a void region should become more and more filamentary .",
    "an intriguing issue is what effect the filamentary mini - web has on the evolution of the void galaxies and how strong it is .",
    "this can be addressed by looking for correlations between the intrinsic properties of the void galaxies and the characteristics of the void filaments .",
    "in fact , the voids should be an optimal ground for the investigation of the effect of the filamentary web on the galaxy evolution ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "first of all , since the void filaments are much less intricate than their wall counterparts , it is less difficult to identify and characterize them .",
    "furthermore , since the densities of the voids are all constrained to extremely low values , the effect of the environmental density on the properties of the void galaxies can be controlled and thus it should be easier to single out the dependence of the galaxy properties on the filamentary web for the case of the void galaxies .    the mini - filaments that pass through a void are expected to bridge the void galaxies with the surrounding denser regions .",
    "hence , the gas and dark matter from the surroundings can be transported into the void regions along the mini - filaments , which would enhance the growth of the void galaxies @xcite .",
    "the recent observation of @xcite which reported a detection of real - time star - forming activities in the void galaxies embedded in the filamentary channels full of hi cold gases is in line with this picture that the void galaxies can rapidly grow through the filamentary connection with the surroundings .",
    "the bridge effect of void filaments was first noted and quantitatively investigated in the numerical work of @xcite using the millennium run semi - analytic galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "what they found was that the intrinsic properties of the void galaxies such as the total mass , luminosity and blackhole mass are strongly correlated with the degree of the straightness of the host filaments .",
    "@xcite suggested that the presence of this correlation should be attributed to the dependence of the efficacy of gas transportation on the geometrical shapes of the void filaments : the more straight void filaments should more efficiently carry gas and matter onto the void galaxies . here",
    ", our goal is to detect the bridge effect of the void filament from observational data .",
    "the upcoming sections are outlined as follows . in section [ sec : voidfil ] we describe how the void filaments are identified from the sloan void catalog and how the degrees of their straightness are measured . in section [ sec : bridge ]",
    "we report an observational detection of the correlation signals between the luminosities of the void galaxies and the degrees of the straightness of their host filaments . in section [ sec : con ] we summarise the results and discuss what clues we can obtain to the formation and evolution of the void galaxies from this observational detection as well as what future works would improve the current analysis . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume a flat @xmath1cdm universe where the cosmological constant @xmath1 and cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominate at the present epoch whose initial conditions are described by @xmath2,(@xmath3 ) , to be consistent with @xcite .",
    "since there is no unique way to define both the filaments and the voids , it is first necessary to decide on which algorithm to use for the identification of both . in the current analysis , to be consistent with @xcite , we choose the filament - finding and the void - finding algorithms developed by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hv02 ) , respectively .",
    "the former is based on the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) technique to find the networking pattern ( i.e. , mst ) in the spatial distributions of the point sources and identify the filamentary structures as the most conspicuous cylindrical structures in the interconnected msts @xcite .    in the hv02 algorithm ,",
    "a void is identified as an underdense region containing only field but no wall galaxies .",
    "the distance to the fourth nearest galaxy was used as a criterion for the classification of a galaxy : for the wall ( field ) galaxy , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) where @xmath6 is a given threshold distance whose value depends on the parent sample of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "the boundary of a void is approximated by the continuous surfaces of the superimposed spheres that fit the underdense region @xcite .",
    "@xcite constructed a catalog of the local voids by applying the hv02 algorithm to the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr7)@xcite .",
    "the void catalog contains a total of @xmath7 giant voids in the redshift range of @xmath8 .",
    "it is basically a magnitude - limited sample of the void galaxies for each of which information on redshift , equatorial coordinates and the @xmath9-band magnitude is all available .",
    "the effective radii ( @xmath10 ) and the numbers of the member galaxies ( @xmath11 ) of the voids were found to be in the ranges of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively @xcite .",
    "as @xcite did , we exclude those voids which have less than thirty member galaxies from the void catalog of pan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) on the grounds that the filamentary structures are hard to find from those voids .",
    "a sample of @xmath14 giant local voids is constructed to which we apply the mst - based filament finding algorithm as follows . for each void in the sample ,",
    "the member galaxies are regarded as points .",
    "the link between a randomly chosen point and its nearest point forms an initial mst , which grows and become updated as the other points in the same void are sequentially added to it in an decreasing order of the separation distances via an iterative search for the nearest points .",
    "a full mst comes out from each void if all of the points become connected .",
    "the void filaments are obtained by reducing down a full mst , which requires us to specify two parameters : the pruning level @xmath15 and the separation threshold @xmath16 .",
    "after the minor branches consisting of less than @xmath15 points are all pruned away , the remaining part of the mst is separated into several mini - filaments by disjoining the galaxies whose separation distances are larger than a given threshold @xmath16 @xcite . for the detailed description of the mst - based filament identification procedures applied to the void regions , see @xcite and @xcite .    as done in @xcite and @xcite , the best pruning level @xmath15",
    "is determined as the value at which the size distribution of the void filaments becomes stabilized in the large size section , where the size @xmath17 of a filament is defined as the spatial extent of the three dimensional positions of its member galaxies .",
    "the size distribution of the void filaments , @xmath18 , is calculated as the number of the void filaments whose sizes @xmath17 belong to the differential interval @xmath19 $ ] @xcite .",
    "varying the pruning level @xmath15 from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , we repeatedly apply the mst - based filament finder to the @xmath14 giant voids and determine @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ fig : dnds ] plots the size distributions of the void filaments from our void sample , @xmath18 , for six different cases of the pruning level @xmath15 . for the case of @xmath22 ,",
    "the functional form of @xmath18 fluctuates with the change of @xmath15 in the large size section ( @xmath23mpc ) .",
    "however , note that it becomes stabilized against the change of @xmath15 if @xmath15 reaches and exceeds @xmath24 , which leads us to determine the best pruning level to be @xmath25 .",
    "it is interesting to recall that in the numerical experiment of @xcite the size distribution of the void filaments from the millennium semi - analytic galaxy catalog was shown to become stabilized at the same pruning level @xmath25 .",
    "since the best value of @xmath15 depends on the number of the sample galaxies , we investigate how the best value of @xmath15 changes if the minimum number of the void galaxies , say @xmath26 , differs from the threshold value of @xmath27 adopted by @xcite .",
    "varying the value of @xmath26 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , we repeat the whole process to evaluate @xmath18 , which is shown in figure [ fig : vary_dnds ] .",
    "although the number density of the void filaments with large sizes ( @xmath30mpc ) decreases substantially as the value of @xmath31 increases , it is found that the four different cases of @xmath31 yield the same pruning level @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the correlation strength between the luminosity and the straightness of the void filaments quantified by the pearson product moment correlation coefficient @xmath9 turns out to be robust against the change of @xmath26 ( see section [ sec : bridge ] ) . throughout this paper , we set @xmath26 at @xmath27 to be consistent with @xcite",
    ".    to determine the value of @xmath16 , @xcite sought for the value which maximizes the number of the void filaments consisting of four and more member galaxies .",
    "they excluded the filaments with less than four member galaxies since those filaments should always have high degree of straightness .",
    "@xcite noted that the number of the void filaments with four and more member galaxies varies strongly with @xmath16 and reached the highest value when @xmath16 is equal to @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mean and the standard deviation of the separation distances of the member galaxies belonging to the unpruned msts , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the values of @xmath33 and @xmath35 from the unpruned msts of the void galaxies found in the sloan void catalog of @xcite , we determine the critical separation distance @xmath16 as @xmath36 .    among a total of @xmath37 void filaments found in the redshift range of @xmath8 from the sloan void catalog of @xcite , the richest one turns out to have @xmath38 nodes where the node is a jargon of the mst algorithm referring to a member galaxy of a filament @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : n_dis ] shows the number of the void filaments @xmath39 as a function of the number of their nodes , @xmath40 , in our sample . for the right - most bin , we plot the accumulated numbers of the void filaments which have @xmath41 or more nodes . as can be seen , the number of the void filaments @xmath39 decreases sharply with the number of the nodes @xmath40 , indicating that the filaments are relatively short in the voids compared with the wall counterparts .",
    "in the original work of @xcite based on a n - body simulation , the linearity , @xmath42 , of each filament , defined as the ratio of its end - to - end separation to its total length was used as an indicator of the straightness where the total length of a void filament was defined as the sum of the separation distances between the adjacent nodes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in our current work dealing with the void filaments from real observations identified in redshift space , the linearity @xmath42 may not be a good indicator of the degree of the straightness of a void filament since the total length of a void filament that enters in the definition of @xmath42 depends sensitively on how accurately the positions of the void galaxies are measured .",
    "the systematic errors associated with the redshift - space measurement of @xmath42 may severely contaminate the measurement of the correlations between the luminosity of the void galaxies and the degree of the straightness of the hosting void filaments .",
    "therefore , instead of @xmath42 , we use the specific size of each void filament , @xmath43 , defined as the size per node as an indicator of the straightness .",
    "the concept of the specific size of a filamentary structure was first introduced by @xcite who showed that the filamentary structures having larger specific sizes tend to have more straight shapes ( see figure 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for each void filament in our sample",
    ", we also determine the mean absolute value , @xmath44 , of the absolute @xmath9-band magnitudes of the member galaxies .",
    "since the absolute magnitude @xmath45 of a galaxy has a negative value and what matters in the current analysis is not the sign but the magnitude of @xmath45 , we take the absolute value of @xmath44 to investigate the correlation with the specific size of the hosting void filament . from there on , @xmath44 denotes the mean absolute value of @xmath45 averaged over the member galaxies of each void filament in the sample .",
    "figure [ fig : scatter ] plots how the void filaments in our sample are scattered in the plane spanned by @xmath44 and @xmath43 , showing an obvious trend that the averaged luminosity of the void galaxies increases with the degree of the straightness of their host filament . before interpreting this trend as an observational evidence for the bridge effect of the void filaments",
    ", it should be critical to examine the possibility that the trend might be just a consequence of the malmquist bias @xcite .",
    "given that the sloan void catalog of @xcite is a magnitude - limited sample , the high-@xmath46 void filaments must be biased being composed only of very luminous galaxies . since the mean separation distance obtained from a sample including only the very luminous galaxies should be larger than than from a sample including the dim galaxies , the separation threshold @xmath16 that is used as a criterion to separate each mst into filaments ( see section [ sec : voidfil ] ) tends to have a larger value for the case of the high-@xmath46 voids .",
    "therefore , the void filaments identified at high - redshifts via the mst algorithm are likely to have more extended spatial sizes per node , which would in turn create a spurious signal of correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "there are two different ways to remove the malmquist bias .",
    "the first way is to construct a volume - limited sample of the void galaxies up to @xmath47 by excluding the dim galaxies below the corresponding threshold magnitude limit .",
    "the second one is to consider only the nearby void filaments located at the lowest redshifts .",
    "we choose the second direction for the following reason .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the bridge effect is believed to be related to the effect of the anisotropic tidal shear field on the evolution of the void galaxies ( see also section [ sec : con ] for a full discussion ) .",
    "thus , to detect a genuine signal of the bridge effect , it is important to identify the void filaments whose straightness can reflect well the anisotropic nature of the tidal shear field . if the void filaments are found in the volume - limited sample of the luminous galaxies above the corresponding magnitude limit , it is likely that the degree of their straightness fails to represent the degree of anisotropy of the tidal shear field because the luminous galaxies are the biased tracers of the matter density field . as the luminous galaxies are expected to have formed at the high peaks of the matter density field whose gravitational collapse proceeds quite isotropically @xcite ,",
    "the void filaments identified from the volume - limited sample would fail to capture the unbiased features of the tidal shear field , no matter how straight they are .",
    "in other words , to represent the anisotropic nature of the tidal shear field and its effect on the evolution of the filament galaxies in void regions , the void filament must be identified from the unbiased tracers including the dim galaxies ( or low - mass halos ) .",
    "that is why we choose to use a magnitude - limited low - z sample instead of a volume limited high - z sample , even though the latter is a homogeneous one .",
    "a magnitude - limited sample of the nearby void filaments whose redshift is low enough to avoid any false signal caused by the malmquist bias and whose size is large enough to produce a significant signal is found to correspond to the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "we find a total of @xmath48 void filaments whose relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is shown in figure [ fig : main_scatter ] . as can be seen , even at this low redshift bin @xmath0 ,",
    "the absolute mean values , @xmath44 , of the void filaments still appear to be correlated with their specific sizes @xmath43 . to quantify the correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath43 of the @xmath48 void filaments",
    ", we calculate the pearson product moment coefficient , @xmath9 , as @xcite : @xmath49^{1/2 } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the ensemble averages of the mean absolute @xmath9-band magnitudes and the specific sizes over the @xmath48 void filaments , respectively , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the corresponding rms fluctuations , respectively .    from the @xmath48 void filaments with four or more member galaxies located at @xmath0 , we find @xmath56 where the errors associated with the estimate of @xmath9 is also calculated as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath39 is the number of the void filaments .",
    "to see at what confidence level the null hypothesis of no correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath43 is rejected , we perform the student-@xmath58 statistics as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the degree of freedom of the @xmath58-variable . plugging @xmath61 and @xmath62 into equation ( [ eqn : student ] )",
    ", we find that the null hypothesis is rejected at @xmath63 confidence level .    now that we find an observational evidence for the correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we would like to investigate if the strength of correlation depends on the richness of the void filaments ( i.e. , the number of nodes , @xmath40 ) . dividing the void filaments at @xmath0 into three @xmath40-bins ,",
    "we calculate @xmath9 separately by using only those void filaments belonging to each @xmath40-bin .",
    "figure [ fig:3panel_scatter ] shows the @xmath43-@xmath44 scatter plots for three different bins of @xmath40 .",
    "table [ tab : result ] also lists the mean redshifts , the numbers of the void filaments and the estimated values of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient @xmath9 between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( the fourth column ) for three @xmath40-bins .",
    "as can be read , the richer filaments exhibit stronger correlations between @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "the value of @xmath9 reaches as high as @xmath64 for the richest case of @xmath65 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the increase of @xmath9 with @xmath40 is not caused by the redshift - difference among the three @xmath40-bins .",
    "we have so far followed the frequentist s approach to quantify the correlations between @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "however , the reliability of the frequentist s approach depends on the sample size .",
    "given that the numbers of the low-@xmath46 void filaments at each @xmath40-bin are not large enough to guarantee the success of the frequentist s approach , we also take the bayesian approach by computing the posterior probability density distribution of the true correlation coefficient , @xmath66 as @xcite @xmath67\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 represents the conditional probability of @xmath66 provided that the pearson product moment correlation coefficient has the value of @xmath9 at each @xmath40-bin . here",
    ", we assume a flat prior for @xmath69 and normalized @xmath70 to satisfy @xmath71 .",
    "the left , middle and right panels of figure [ fig : bayes ] show @xmath72 , for the cases of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath65 , respectively . as can be seen ,",
    "the maximum probability is achieved when the true correlation coefficient exceeds @xmath64 for the case of the richest filaments , supporting the results obtained from the frequentist s approach .",
    "the observed trend that the correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath43 becomes stronger with the richness of the void filament can be understood as follows .",
    "the richer void filaments correspond to deeper gravitational potential well which can accommodate larger amounts of cold gas , which in turn can be transported even to the central regions of the voids from the surroundings if the void filaments are more spatially extended . in consequence",
    ", the mean luminosity of the void galaxies located in the richer filaments would develop more sensitive dependence on the spatial extents of the filamentary networking .",
    "it may be worth examining the dependence of the final result on how to quantify the degree of the straightness of the void filaments .",
    "as in the original work of @xcite , we measure the linearity @xmath42 of the @xmath48 void filaments and investigate the correlations between @xmath42 and @xmath44 at three @xmath40-bins , which are shown in figure [ fig : rl_mr ] .",
    "the pearson product moment correlation coefficients between @xmath42 and @xmath44 for the three different @xmath40-bin are listed in the fifth column of table [ tab : result ] .",
    "as can be seen , no correlation is found between @xmath42 and @xmath44 , which is inconsistent with the result of @xcite whose numerical analysis found the existence of a strong correlation @xmath75 between them . to understand where this inconsistency stems from",
    ", we examine how strongly @xmath42 and @xmath43 are correlated with each other for the three @xmath40-bins , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig : ts_rl ] and listed in the sixth column of table [ tab : result ] .",
    "as can be seen , a signal of mild correlation is found for the case of @xmath76 but no signal at all for the other two cases .",
    "note that for the case of @xmath73 , the linearity tends to be biased toward high values of @xmath77 . as explained in @xcite , for the case that the filaments have small number of nodes , the linearity @xmath42 is prone to high values , failing to represent well the degree of filament straightness . for the case of the rich filaments with large number of nodes ,",
    "the linearity @xmath42 is a good indicator of the filament straightness only provided that the positions of the nodes are measured with high accuracy .",
    "when the measurements are done in the redshift space , however , the redshift - space errors would contaminate the measurement of each of the positions of the nodes , which would propagate into the errors in the measurements of the total lengths of the filaments .",
    "the larger numbers of the nodes a filament has , the larger amount of propagated error would contaminate the measurement of its total length which would in turn cause large uncertainties in the estimate of its linearity .",
    "the aim of this work was to observationally test the scenario suggested by @xcite that the void galaxies located in the more straight filaments would be more luminous since the efficacy of the gas accretion along the void filaments into the void galaxies increases with the degree of the straightness of the void filaments .",
    "the catalog of the giant galaxy voids constructed by @xcite from the sdss dr7 datasets with the help of the hv02 void finding algorithm @xcite has been used as the parent sample and the mst - based filament finder was employed to identify the filamentary structures in the galaxy voids .    determining the specific size ( size per node , @xmath43 ) of each void filament as a measure of its straightness and the mean absolute value of the absolute @xmath9-band magnitude @xmath44 of the member galaxies , we investigated if and how @xmath44 is correlated with @xmath43 on average by measuring the pearson product moment correlation coefficient , @xmath9 , between the two quantities . to avoid a false signal of correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 caused by the malmquist bias , we have focused only on the lowest redshift for the detection of the bridge effect . from a total of @xmath48 void filaments consisting of four or more member galaxies ( nodes ) in the redshift range of @xmath0 , it is found to be @xmath78 .",
    "although this observational signal is not quantitatively consistent with the numerical estimate , @xmath75 , by @xcite based on the millennium run semi - analytic galaxy catalog @xcite , it is a five sigma signal and thus may be regarded as the observational evidence for the existence of the bridge effect of the void filaments .",
    "we have also inspected if and how the strength of correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath43 changes with the node number @xmath40 of the void filaments ( i.e. , the _ richness _ of the void filaments ) and noted a trend that the value @xmath9 gradually increases with the richness of the void filament .",
    "our explanation for this trend is as follows .",
    "a richer filament must correspond to a deeper well of the gravitational potential that could accommodate larger amounts of gas inflow from the surroundings .",
    "in consequence the void galaxies located in a richer filament would develop more sensitive dependence on the degree of the straightness of void filament .",
    "the straightness of the void filaments reflects how anisotropic the spatial distributions of the void galaxies are . as the voids evolve and their densities decrease",
    ", they would become more susceptible to the external tidal forces , which in turn augment the degree of the anisotropy of the spatial distributions of the void galaxies .",
    "in other words , the capacity of the void filaments as a transportation channel would increase in the nonlinear stage of the void evolution where the tidal shear field develop nonlinear correlations . in consequence ,",
    "the star formation activity in the void galaxies would become stimulated by the efficient supply of the cold gases along the straight void filaments .",
    "the presence of the bridge effect of void filaments that has been confirmed by our observational analysis may provide an important clue to the mechanism through which the void galaxies become gas richer , bluer colored , and have higher specific star formation rates than their wall counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , we have yet to answer the fundamental question of what caused the bridge effect of void filaments .",
    "a more comprehensive study based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations will be desirable to quantitatively understand why and how the accretion of cold gas occur more efficiently along the straight filaments that emerge during the nonlinear stage of the void evolutions .",
    "also , in the original work of @xcite , not only the mean luminosity but also the mean mass of the central blackholes of the void galaxies were found to be higher in the more straight void filaments .",
    "in fact , it was the mean mass of the central blackholes that yielded the strongest correlation with the degree of the straightness of the void filaments .",
    "although it is very hard to measure directly the masses of the central blackholes , the x - ray luminosities of the void galaxies with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , if any , could be used to quantify how massive their central blackholes are .",
    "our future work will focus on searching for the agn galaxies in the void regions and exploring observationally if and how their agn activities are correlated with the degree of the straightness of the void filaments .",

    "<S> _ the bridge effect of void filaments _ is a phrase coined by @xcite to explain the correlations found in a numerical experiment between the luminosity of the void galaxies and the degree of the straightness of their host filaments . </S>",
    "<S> their numerical finding implies that a straight void filament provides a narrow channel for the efficient transportation of gas and matter particles from the surroundings into the void galaxies . analyzing the sloan void catalog constructed by @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we identify the filamentary structures in void regions and determine the specific size of each void filament as a measure of its straightness . to avoid possible spurious signals caused by the malmquist bias , we consider only those void filaments whose redshifts are in the range of @xmath0 and find a clear tendency that the void galaxies located in the more straight filaments are on average more luminous , which is in qualitative agreement with the numerical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the strength of correlation increases with the number of the member galaxies of the void filaments , which can be physically understood on the grounds that the more stretched filaments can connect the dense surroundings even to the galaxies located deep in the central parts of the voids . </S>",
    "<S> this observational evidence may provide a key clue to the puzzling issue of why the void galaxies have higher specific star formation rates and bluer colors than their wall counterparts . </S>"
