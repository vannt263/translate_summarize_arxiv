    "the schottky - like anomaly at @xmath123 k , taken to be a strong indicator of crystal field splitting , may conceivably be due to a complex temperature dependence of @xmath81 , which can occur when the value of @xmath81 is greatly enhanced,@xcite as is observed in smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .      the low value of the magnetic entropy at the transition , the lack of features in the electrical resistivity at the transition , the low non - saturating magnetization , and the unexplained critical exponents seem to suggest that the ferromagnetism is either unconventional , or due to an unknown impurity phase .",
    "although an impurity phase may be responsible for the ferromagnetism , it should be noted that many compounds exhibit similar behavior , including the itinerant ferromagnets zrzn@xmath67 , ni@xmath29al , and sc@xmath29in,@xcite many other heavy fermion systems such as ceni@xmath226ga@xmath227 , ybrhsb , and ce@xmath138sn@xmath29,@xcite and the heavy fermion filled skutterudite smfe@xmath0p@xmath1.@xcite for instance , the low value of the magnetic entropy at the transition ( @xmath228 ) and the small size of the feature due to magnetic ordering in @xmath71 of smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 are consistent with the behavior observed in weak itinerant ferromagnets such as sc@xmath29in.@xcite similar behavior is also observed in several heavy fermion systems such as ceni@xmath226ga@xmath227 , ybrhsb , ce@xmath138sn@xmath29 , and smfe@xmath0p@xmath1.@xcite these heavy fermion systems all show anomalies in @xmath71 , although the magnetic entropy at the phase transitions of each of these systems ranges from ( @xmath229 to @xmath230)@xmath98 .",
    "the lack of features in the electrical resistivity at the transition is also consistent with the weak itinerant ferromagnets zrzn@xmath67 , ni@xmath29al , and sc@xmath29in,@xcite as well as smfe@xmath0p@xmath1.@xcite none of these compounds shows a clear indication of a phase transition in @xmath106 . in the case of the magnetization of smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 ,",
    "the low non - saturating moment is similar to behavior that has been observed in the magnetization of smfe@xmath0p@xmath1 , which at @xmath23 k reaches a value around @xmath231f.u .",
    "by @xmath27 t.@xcite this non - saturating moment is also observed in weak itinerant ferromagnets , such as zrzn@xmath67 , ni@xmath29al , and sc@xmath29in.@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the systems described above is not clearly understood and has been attributed to either kondo screening or itinerant electron magnetism .",
    "assuming the presence of a ferromagnetic impurity phase , the percentage of this phase present in a sample of smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 can be estimated from the observed magnetization .",
    "since sm is the only magnetic constituent in smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , it is reasonable to assume a moment of @xmath232/f.u . for the impurity phase . in order to produce the magnetization observed at @xmath55 k and @xmath27 t , the impurity phase would need to constitute @xmath233 of the total mass of the crystal , assuming that the molecular weight of the impurity phase is comparable to that of sm .",
    "based on this , it is clear that it would be very difficult to resolve the potential impurity phase in x - ray powder diffraction data . to check whether the unconventional magnetic behavior was due to impurities in the raw materials ,",
    "single crystals were grown from ultra - high quality materials ( sm @xmath42 , os @xmath34 , sb @xmath34 ) .",
    "magnetization measurements made on these crystals did not differ significantly from those made on previous crystals grown from lower quality starting materials .",
    "this finding seems to indicate that if there is an impurity phase , then a sm compound is the most likely candidate .",
    "the applicability of the modified arrott analysis to smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 indicates that the ferromagnetic ordering is not described by mean field critical exponents ( @xmath234 , and @xmath235 ) .",
    "deviation from mean - field behavior is not uncommon .",
    "for instance , the magnetic interactions in a given compound may be best described by other models , such as the 3d heisenberg model for which @xmath236 , and @xmath237.@xcite the critical exponents determined for smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 clearly do not agree with those of the 3d heisenberg model , or any of the other standard models.@xcite other possible explanations for the unconventional critical exponents include cef splitting,@xcite disorder of a single magnetic phase,@xcite or the existence of multiple magnetic phases . in the case of smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , it seems that the presence of an impurity phase could lead to the unusual critical exponents that have been observed .",
    "for example , the usual mean field critical exponents of some ferromagnetic impurity could be obscured by the presence of a large paramagnetic contribution .",
    "however , it is also possible that the odd magnetic behavior is intrinsic to smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and the unexplained critical exponents may reflect some type of novel magnetic ordering .",
    "neutron scattering measurements could offer insight into this possibility .",
    "measurements of @xmath45 , @xmath238 , @xmath111 , and @xmath63 have been performed on the filled skutterudite compound smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath45 measurements reveal a strongly enhanced electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath239 mj / mol k@xmath21 , indicative of a large quasiparticle effective mass @xmath93 .",
    "a fit of a possible schottky anomaly to the @xmath45 data indicates cef splitting of the sm@xmath4 six - fold degenerate hund s rule multiplet into a @xmath5 doublet ground state and a @xmath6 quartet excited state separated by @xmath217 k. the electrical resistivity has a strong temperature dependence below @xmath9 k. cef fits to this region agree well with the specific heat measurements and yield an energy splitting of @xmath216 k between the @xmath5 doublet ground state and the @xmath6 quartet excited state .",

    "the hysteresis observed in @xmath64 at @xmath55 k , the low value of the ordered moment , and conformity of the @xmath111 data to a modified arrott plot are consistent with weak ferromagnetic order possibly due to an impurity phase .",
