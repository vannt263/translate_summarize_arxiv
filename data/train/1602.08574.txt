    "_ image segmentation _ denotes the task of partitioning an image in its constituent parts . feature based segmentation looks at distinctive characteristics ( features ) in the image , grouping similar pixels into clusters which are meaningful for the application at hand .",
    "typical examples of features are based on greyscale / rgb intensity and texture .",
    "mathematical methods for image segmentation are mainly formalised in terms of variational problems in which the segmented image is a minimiser of an energy .",
    "the most common image feature encoded in such energies is the magnitude of the image gradient , detecting regions ( or contours ) where sharp variations of the intensity values occur .",
    "examples include the mumford - shah segmentation approach @xcite , the snakes and geodesic active contour models @xcite . moreover , in @xcite chan and vese proposed an instance of the mumford - shah model for piecewise constant images whose energy is based on the mean greyvalues of the image inside and outside of the segmented region rather than the image gradient and hence does not require strong edges for segmentation .",
    "other image segmentation methods have been considered in @xcite .",
    "they rely on the use of the total variation ( tv ) seminorm @xcite , which is commonly used for image processing tasks due to its properties of simultaneous edge preservation and smoothing ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the non - smoothness of most of the segmentation energies renders their numerical minimisation usually difficult . in the case of the mumford - shah segmentation model",
    "the numerical realisation is additionally complicated by its dependency on the image function as well as the object contour . to overcome this , several regularisation methods and approximations",
    "have been proposed in the literature , e.g. @xcite for mumford - shah segmentation . in the context of tv based segmentation models",
    "the ginzburg - landau functional has an important role .",
    "originally considered for the modelling of physical phenomena such as phase transition and phase separation ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a survey on the topics ) it is used in imaging for approximating the tv energy .",
    "some examples of the use of this functional in the context of image processing are @xcite , which relate to previous works by ambrosio and tortorelli on diffuse interface approximation models @xcite .",
    "such variational methods for image segmentation have been extensively studied from an analytical point of view and the segmentation is usually robust and computationally efficient . however , variational image segmentation as described above still faces many problems in the presence of low contrast and the absence of clear boundaries separating regions .",
    "their main drawback is that they are limited to image features which can be mathematically formalised ( e.g. in terms of an image gradient ) and encoded within a segmentation energy . in recent years dictionary based methods have become more and more popular in the image processing community , complementing more classical variational segmentation methods . by learning",
    "the distinctive features of the region to be segmented from examples provided by the user , these methods are able to segment the desired regions in the image correctly .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the method proposed in @xcite for image segmentation and labelling .",
    "this approach goes beyond the standard variational approach in two respects .",
    "firstly , the model is set up in the purely discrete framework of graphs .",
    "this is rather unusual for variational models where one normally considers functionals and function spaces defined on subdomains of @xmath0 in order to exploit properties and tools from convex and functional analysis and calculus of variations .",
    "secondly , the new framework allows for more flexibility in terms of the features considered .",
    "additional features like texture , light intensity or others , can be considered as well without encoding them in the function space or the regularity of the functions . due to the possibly very large size of the image ( nowadays of the order of megapixel for professional cameras ) and the large number of features considered",
    ", the construction of the problem may be computationally expensive and often requires reduction techniques @xcite . in several papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) the segmentation problem was rephrased in the graph framework by means of the graph cut objective function .    in this paper",
    ", we also address the problem of detection of objects with geometrical properties that are _ a priori _ known .",
    "an example is the detection of lines and circles .",
    "these objects can be identified by mapping them onto an auxiliary space where relevant geometrical properties ( such as linear alignment and roundness ) are represented as peaks of specific auxiliary functions . in this work ,",
    "we use the hough transform @xcite to detect measurement tools ( rulers , concentric circles of fixed radii ) with the intent of providing quantitative , scale - independent measurements of the region segmented by one of the techniques described above . in this way ,",
    "an absolute measurement of the region of interest in the image is possible , independent of the scale of the image , which could depend , for instance , on the distance of the objective to the camera .",
    "we demonstrate the use of our method in the context of real world applications in which segmentation and subsequent object measurement are crucial .",
    "our main application is the measurement of the white forehead patch ( blaze ) of male pied flycatchers , which has been studied with regard to sexual selection in @xcite , see figure [ fig : im_database ] .",
    "the forehead patch is known to vary between individuals @xcite and can be subject to both intra- @xcite and intersexual @xcite selection with pied flycatchers from spain preferring males with large patches .",
    "forehead patch size has been shown to signal male phenotypic quality through plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity @xcite . however , in all studies to date the measurements of patches have been inconsistent and generally inaccurate . for example",
    "some studies have simply measured patch height @xcite , whereas potti and montalvo @xcite assumed the shape to be a trapezium with area equal to @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the white patch width , @xmath3 the bill width and @xmath4 the height of the white patch .",
    "morales et al .",
    "@xcite measured the length and breadth of the forehead patch with callipers to the nearest @xmath5 and its size ( @xmath6 ) was calculated as the area of a rectangle .",
    "other studies have measured the patches from photographs , e.g. , jrvist et al .",
    "@xcite ruuskanen et al .",
    "@xcite and sirki et al .",
    "@xcite who photographed the forehead with a scale bar included in each picture , and measured the patch as the white area in @xmath6 using imagej software @xcite .",
    "but none of these three papers provide methods of how the measurement was actually achieved , e.g. , whether patches were delineated or roughly estimated with a simple shape .",
    "most recently moreno et al .",
    "@xcite analysed digital photos of forehead patches with adobe photoshop cs version 11.0 .",
    "relating the distance of @xmath7 on the ruler to number of pixels , and used this to estimate length . zooming to 400% and using the paintbrush tool with 100% hardness and 25% spacing the authors delineate the patch and measure the area of the white areas on forehead .",
    "while this is the best measurement method to date , it still is subject to human measurement error and subjective assessment of patch boundaries .",
    "we report some segmentation results obtained by manual selection and polygon fitting in figure [ fig : previous_methods_blaze ] . in this manuscript",
    "we use a mathematically robust approach to segment the blaze independently to provide an accurate measurement of forehead patch area .",

    "moreover , to our knowledge there is only little contribution in the literature that broach the issue of how the graph segmentation approach as well as the hough transform are applied to specific problems @xcite .",
    "indeed , here we present these methodologies in detail , especially discussing important aspects in their practical implementation , and demonstrate the robust applicability of our programme for measuring the size of objects , showcasing its performance on several examples arising in zoology , medicine and archaeology .",

    "state - of - the - art methods for such a task typically require the user to fit polygons inside or outside the blaze @xcite or to segment the blaze by hand @xcite .",

    ", we also recall a splitting technique and a popular matrix completion technique used in our problem to overcome the computational costs . .",
    "finally , section [ sec : res ] contains the numerical results obtained with our combined method applied to the problems described above .",
    "we present in this section the mathematical background for the design of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) graph segmentation algorithm introduced in @xcite . there",
    ", the image segmentation problem is rephrased as a minimisation problem on a graph defined by features computed from the image .",
    "compared to the methods above , the graph framework allows for more freedom in terms of the possible features used to describe the image , such as texture .      in the following , we recall the main properties of the original continuum version of the gl functional explaining its importance in the context of image segmentation problems as well as the main concepts of graph theory which will be used for the segmentation modelling .",
    "several physical problems modelling phase transition and phase separation phenomena are built around the well - known gl functional : @xmath8 the functional above is defined in the continuous setting .",
    "here , @xmath9 represents a open subset of @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the density of a two - phase material and @xmath12 is a double - well potential , e.g. @xmath13 .",
    "the two wells @xmath14 of @xmath15 correspond to the two phases of the material .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the spatial scale .",
    "variational models built around this functional are also referred to as _ diffuse interface _ models because of the interface appearing between the two regions containing the phases ( i.e. the two wells of @xmath15 ) due to the competition between the two terms of the functional .",
    "nonetheless , some smoothness preventing @xmath17 from having jumps between the two regions is ensured by the first regularisation term .",
    "the use of the gl functional has become very popular in image processing due to its connections with the total variation ( tv ) seminorm . in @xcite , for instance , @xmath18-convergence properties of to the tv functional are shown .",
    "thus , the gl functional is very often used as a quadratic approximation of total variation .",
    "fast numerical schemes relying on these connections have been designed for many imaging problems , thus overcoming the issues related to nonsmooth tv minimisation @xcite . in image processing ,",
    "the functional considered often is of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a fidelity term measuring the distance of the reconstructed image @xmath17 to the given image @xmath21 .",
    "depending on the application , different data fidelities are employed .",
    "typically , they are related to statistical and physical assumptions of the model considered .",
    "standard examples of fidelity terms are @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 determines the influence of the data fit compared to the regularisation .",
    "taking the @xmath24 gradient descent of we get the following evolutionary pde , known in the literature as the allen - cahn equation @xcite with an additional forcing term due to the fidelity @xmath25 : @xmath26 steady states of equation are the stationary points of the energy @xmath27 in .",
    "note that @xmath27 is not convex so uniqueness is not guaranteed and , consequently , the long time behaviour for solutions of will depend on the initial condition . the linear diffusion term weighted by @xmath28 appearing in allows for fast solvers using for instance the fast fourier transform ( fft ) which translates the laplace operator into a multiplication operator on the fourier modes .      in the following , we rely on the method presented in @xcite for high - dimensional data classification on graphs which has been applied to several imaging problems @xcite , showing good performance and robustness .",
    "we consider the problem of binary image segmentation where we want to partition a given image into two components where each component is a set of pixels ( also called a cluster , or a class ) and represents a certain object or group of objects .",
    "typically , some _ a priori _ information describing the object(s ) we want to extract is given and serves as initial input for the segmentation algorithm .",
    "for image labelling , in @xcite two images are taken as input : the first one has been manually segmented in two classes and the objective is to automatically segment the second image using the information provided by the segmentation of the first one .",
    "we revise in the following the main ingredients of the model considered and start from a quick review of concepts in graph theory . . for each @xmath29",
    ", we define the image neighbourhood of @xmath30 as the set @xmath31 with @xmath32 fixed , i.e. @xmath33 contains the pixels in a @xmath34 sized square centred at @xmath30 .",
    "for some appropriate @xmath35 , we associate to every pixel @xmath29 a vector @xmath36 encoding selected characteristics of the neighbourhood @xmath33 .",
    "these characteristics are related to the grey or rgb ( red , green , blue ) intensity values as well as the texture features of the neighbourhood . in section  [ subsec : alggl ] , we will explain in more detail our feature vector construction .",
    "the map @xmath37 is called the feature function . for constructing the feature vectors it will be useful to associate a neighbourhood vector @xmath38 to each neighbourhood , such that the ordering of the @xmath39 in @xmath40 is consistent between pixels @xmath30 , e.g. , order the pixels from each square @xmath33 from left to right and top to bottom .",
    "the specific choice of ordering is not important , as long as it is consistent for each pixel neighbourhood .",
    "next we construct a simple weighted undirected graph @xmath41 whose vertices correspond to the pixels in @xmath42 and with edges whose weights depend on the feature function @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 be a vertex set of cardinality @xmath45 . to emphasize that each vertex in @xmath44 corresponds to exactly one pixel in @xmath42",
    ", we will label the vertex corresponding to @xmath29 by @xmath30 as well .",
    "let @xmath46 be a symmetric and nonnegative function , i.e. for each @xmath47 @xmath48 we define the edge set @xmath27 as the collection of all undirected edges connecting nodes @xmath49 and @xmath39 for which @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath51 restricted to @xmath52 is then a positive edge weight function .    in our applications",

    "weight functions express the similarities between vertices and will be used in the following to partition @xmath44 into clusters such that the sum of the edge weights between the clusters is small .",
    "there are many different mathematical approaches to attempt this partitioning .",
    "when formulated as a balanced cut minimisation , the problem is np - complete @xcite , which inspired relaxations which are more amenable to computational approaches , many of which are closely related to spectral graph theory @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a monograph on the topic .",
    "the method we use in this paper can be understood ( at least in spirit , if not technically , @xcite ) as a nonlinear extension of the linear relaxed problems .    to solve the segmentation problem",
    ", we minimise a _ discrete gl functional _ ( which is formulated in the graph setting , instead of the continuum setting ) , via a gradient descent method similar to the one described in section [ subsec : gl ] . in particular ,",

    "we will use the spectral decomposition of @xmath17 with respect to the eigenfunctions of this laplacian . in section [ subsec : nystrom ] we discuss the nystrm method , which allows us to quickly compute this decomposition , but first we introduce the graph laplacian and graph gl functional .

    "the measurement scale detection task is performed by using the hough transform , a geometrical transformation which is capable of detecting objects with _ a priori _ known geometrical shapes ( like lines on a ruler or circles with fixed diameter ) .",
    "once the measurement scale is detected , all the measurements are converted into a unit of measure which is not image - dependent .",
    "our method represents a systematic and reliable combination of segmentation approaches applied to several real - world image quantification tasks .",
    "the use of dictionaries , moreover , allows for flexibility as , whenever needed , the training database can be updated . with respect to recent developments @xcite in the fields of data mining for the analysis of big data , where predictions are often performed using training sets and clustering",
    ", our approach represents an interesting alternative to standard machine learning ( such as @xmath85-means ) algorithms .",
    "with respect to the eigenvalue problem formulation and , we revise in this section the nystrm extension @xcite in a matrix form .",
    "let us define first the sub matrices @xmath221 and @xmath222 as @xmath223 analogous definitions hold for @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "each of these matrices represents the sub matrix having as elements the weights between the points in @xmath123 , @xmath226 or between the two sets . with this notation",
    ", the whole matrix @xmath227 can be written in block - form as @xmath228 similarly , vectors @xmath229 can be written as @xmath230 .",
    "we focus on the spectral decomposition of the first block of @xmath15 , that is @xmath231 .",
    "since this matrix is symmetric , calling @xmath232 the matrix @xmath233 containining the eigenvalues of @xmath231 , then by the spectral theorem @xmath234 ( compare with ) , with @xmath235 be the orthogonal matrix having as columns the eigenvectors of @xmath231 .",
    "writing for @xmath126 , in operator form , we obtain @xmath236 as @xmath237 the approximated eigenvectors of @xmath15 can then be written in matrix form as @xmath238 let us observe that @xmath239 \\notag\\\\    & = \\begin{pmatrix }    v_x\\theta_x v_x^t & w_{xy } \\\\",

    "w_{yx } & w_{yx}w_{xx}^{-1}w_{xy }   \\end{pmatrix}\\approx w. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , nystrm extension can be interpreted as the approximation @xmath240 , under the approximation of @xmath224 given by @xmath241 the quality of the approximation of the full @xmath15 is quantified by the norm of the schur complement @xmath242 , see @xcite recalling the definition of the symmetric graph laplacian @xmath84 given by and the relation between the spectral decomposition of @xmath15 and the one of @xmath15 in , we observe that a normalisation step now needs to be computed for obtaining the spectral decomposition of @xmath84 .",
    "defining @xmath243 as the @xmath76-dimensional vector consisting of ones and @xmath244 analogously , we use and start computing the nonnegative vector @xmath245 by @xmath246 therefore , the matrices @xmath231 and @xmath247 can be normalised simply by considering : @xmath248 where the division is intended element - wise and @xmath249 is the standard vector tensor product .    a further step of normalisation is now needed since the approximated eigenvectors of @xmath15 , i.e. the columns of the matrix @xmath44 in may not be orthogonal .",
    "such normalisation may be obtained by using auxiliary unitary matrices .",
    "we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.2 ) for more details on this .",
    "once these additional normalisation steps are completed , we then get a spectral decomposition of @xmath15 in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath250 and the corresponding normalised eigenvectors @xmath251 . therefore , recalling ,",
    "the spectral decomposition of @xmath84 is given in terms of the eigenvalue @xmath252 and eigenvectors @xmath253 .",
    "the general idea behind the use of the hough transform @xcite is to map the ambient space to an auxiliary space , called the parameter space ( as it is related to the parametric representation of the geometrical objects we are interested in ) .",
    "there , objects with specified shapes are easily recognisable as peaks of specific functions .",
    "let us clarify these concepts with two examples .",
    "we start from the typical _ slope - intercept form _ of a line : @xmath254 traditionally , the equation above is considered as a function of points with coordinates @xmath255 satisfying equation for _ fixed _ values of @xmath256 and @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", these values identify a specific straight line in the @xmath30-@xmath257 plane , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : houghxy ] . rewriting as @xmath258 and keeping fixed the coordinates @xmath255 we obtain a new equation of a straight line in the @xmath256-@xmath3 plane , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : houghmq ] , depicting the parameter space . if lines in the @xmath256-@xmath3 parameter space intersect , their sign - changed slopes ( given by their @xmath30 values ) and @xmath256-intercepts ( their @xmath257 values ) correspond to points lying on the same line in the @xmath30-@xmath257 plane .",
    "the @xmath259 coordinates of the intersection point in parameter space specify the slope and @xmath30-intercept respectively of that line in the @xmath30-@xmath257 plane .",
    "hence , if we are given a black and white image in the @xmath30-@xmath257 plane , and for all coordinates @xmath255 of black locations in the image , we draw the corresponding lines in the @xmath256-@xmath3 plane , intersection points of those lines will tell us which @xmath255 locations in the image lie on the same line .",
    "of course any two points lie on a line , thus we are specifically interested in intersection points in the @xmath256-@xmath3 plane in which many different lines intersect , indicating the presence of an actual black line segment in the original image .    drawbacks of this parametrisation are the need for an unbounded parameter space to describe near vertical lines and the impossibility to describe a vertical line .",
    "one alternative is the _ normal parametrisation _ which views a straight line in @xmath30-@xmath257 space as the tangent line to a circle with radius @xmath260 , touching the circle at angular coordinate @xmath129 , as illustrated as in figure [ fig : normalparam ] , @xcite . in @xmath260-@xmath129 parameter space",
    "this leads to @xmath261.\\ ] ]    the objects in the parameter space are now sinusoidal curves , but again intersection points identify parameters for the points lying on the same straight line in the @xmath30-@xmath257 plane .",
    "figures [ fig : binim ] and [ fig : binimparsp ] show a binary image with two black straight lines and the corresponding parameter space .",
    "the bright spots in the parameter space indicate a large number of intersections , thus identifying the two lines in the original image .",
    "analogously to what we did above , when looking for circular structures in a given image , we consider , for @xmath262 the parametric representation of a circle , @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the radius of the circle and @xmath265 are the coordinates of its centre .",
    "every point @xmath255 lying on the circle , satisfies equation for fixed @xmath266 and @xmath267 . as before ,",
    "we now consider equation in the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath268 for fixed @xmath30 and @xmath257 . here , the objects of interest are cone - shaped surfaces , as shown in figure [ fig : cones ] .",
    "their intersection identifies the desired values of @xmath266 and @xmath267 in equation , see figure [ fig : accarray ] .",
