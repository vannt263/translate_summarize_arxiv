    "the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( hereafter egb ) represents a fascinating challenge since his first detection by _ sas 2 _ satellite above 30 mev ( fichtel , simpson , & thomson 1978 ) . the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the  _ gamma ray space telescope _ has provided new egb data in the range 0.1 - 100 gev , after one year of observations ( abdo et al .",
    "the egb is the sum of resolved extragalactic sources , and diffuse emission due to unresolved sources and/or intrinsically diffuse radiation , and its measure requires an accurate modeling of galactic foregrounds . in the following",
    "we will refer to the egb as the sum of the diffuse component _ and _ resolved ( by _ fermi _ ) sources . the egb intensity above 100 mev as measured by _",
    "fermi_-lat is @xmath8 @xmath9 s@xmath7 sr@xmath7 , where resolved sources accounts for @xmath10% of the emission , the rest being ascribed to the diffuse component .    bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , collectively known as blazars , are the most common sources in the extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky in the 0.1 - 100 gev range .",
    "therefore many authors considered these sources as the main contributors to the egb ( stecker & salamon 1996 ; mcke & pohl 2000 ; inoue & totani 2009 ; abazajian , blanchet , & harding 2010a ; neronov & semikoz 2011 ; for a review see dermer 2007 ) .",
    "abdo et al . ( 2010b ) recently showed that the contribution of blazars to the egb is not dominant , and the focus has been shifted on different , potentially new , sources . as an example , fields , pavlidou , & prodanovi ( 2010 ) presented a model of the cosmic production of @xmath0-rays powered by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium in star - forming galaxies .",
    "the model reproduces quite well the behavior of the egb up to 10 gev , but it is not fully satisfactory at higher energies .    in the present _ letter _ , we propose a model of the egb based on the @xmath0-ray emission from blazars , non - beamed agns ( seyfert galaxies and qsos ) , and star - forming galaxies . we show that a combination of these three populations fully explains the egb in the _ fermi_-lat energy range .",
    "our model employs three components , blazars , agns , and star - forming galaxies .",
    "first , we assume that the blazar @xmath0-ray luminosity function ( lf ) is proportional to the radio lf of fri and frii galaxies .",
    "to convert radio to @xmath0-ray luminosities we use the spectral energy distribution proposed by fossati et al .",
    "agns are taken from population synthesis models of the x - ray background .",
    "for the star - forming galaxy emission we adopt a model of pion decay in cosmic rays .",
    "our strategy is the following : we first fix the contribution of blazars to the egb by fitting the _",
    "fermi_-lat differential number counts , having as sole fitting parameter the fraction of radio galaxies beamed toward the earth , hence appearing as blazars .",
    "then we add the fixed background from non - beamed agns ( inoue , totani , & ueda 2008 ) .",
    "finally , the contribution of galaxies is obtained by fitting the egb . note",
    "that since the shape of the cosmic ray contribution is determined by pion decay and star formation history , the only free parameter is the star formation  efficiency \" of molecular hydrogen ( stecker & venters 2011 ) .",
    "we checked that results do not change if we instead perform a simultaneous , 2-parameter fit to the number counts and to the background data .    in the following subsections",
    "we briefly describe the details of our modeling . throughout the paper we consider a concordance cosmology with h@xmath11  km / s / mpc , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .      the blazar contribution ( in photons s@xmath7",
    "@xmath9 sr@xmath7 mev@xmath7 ) to the egb at the observed energy @xmath14 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath0-ray lf and @xmath17 is @xmath18 ( in erg / s ) at 100 mev , @xmath19 is the unabsorbed photon flux per unit energy @xmath20 measured on earth of a blazar with luminosity @xmath17 at redshift @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the optical depth for @xmath23 absorption .",
    "we adopt the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) model by finke , razzaque , & dermer ( 2010 ) . in the above equation @xmath24",
    "is the comoving cosmological volume .",
    "we set @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the number of sources @xmath27 per steradian with photon flux greater than @xmath28 is @xmath29 the @xmath0-ray lf of blazars is presently uncertain ( for an estimate see , e.g. , abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) , so that one has to rely on the lfs computed in other bands , e.g. , x - rays ( narumoto & totani 2006 ; inoue & totani 2009 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2010a ) , or radio ( draper & ballantyne 2009 ) .",
    "we adopt here the radio lf at 151 mhz of fri and frii ( willot et al .",
    "2001 ) , assumed to be the parent populations of blazars : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is @xmath18 at 151 mhz , and the constant @xmath32 is the fraction of blazars over all radio galaxies , and it is out first fit parameter .",
    "in order to convert radio into @xmath0-ray luminosity , we must rely on the blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . according to the ssc model , the blazar sed shows two broad peaks , the first located in the ir / x - ray band , due to synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet , and the second in the @xmath0-ray band , due to the inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . as pointed out by fossati et al . ( 1998 ) , a relation between the radio and/or bolometric luminosity and the energy of the two peaks exists ( the so - called _ blazar sequence _ , see also donato et al .",
    "we use the seds computed by inoue & totani ( 2009 ) based on the empirical determinations of donato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "hot thermal electrons in accretion disk coronae of seyfert galaxies and qsos scatter off uv photons into the hard x - ray/@xmath0-ray bands ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "such emission , filtered by absorbing material at a distance of several parsecs form the central source , is though to be responsible of the observed x - ray background ( e.g. , setti & woltjer 1989 ; madau , ghisellini , & fabian 1994 ; gilli , comastri , & hasinger 2007 ) . according to inoue",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) the agns responsible of the hard x - ray background can also account for the 1 - 10 mev egb , provided that an extra non - thermal electron population is considered . as in abazajian et al .",
    "( 2010a ) , we use the model of inoue et al .",
    "2008 with a powerlaw index of non - thermal electrons @xmath33 , a lower limit of the lorentz factor distribution @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum of a star - forming galaxy is based on the assumption that @xmath0-ray emission is due to the decay of @xmath35 mesons . the @xmath35 mesons form in the inelastic collision between cosmic rays and the ism . according to stecker & venters ( 2011 ) ,",
    "the specific @xmath0-ray photon spectrum @xmath36 ( photons s@xmath7 mev@xmath7 ) of a star - forming galaxy is related to the average pionic @xmath0-ray production spectrum per hydrogen atom @xmath37 ( dermer 1986 ; mori 1997 ) as , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the galaxy , both in atomic and molecular form .",
    "we adopt the _ strong coupling @xmath0-ray - star formation rate model _ of stecker & venters ( 2011 ) , where @xmath39 is related to the star formation rate . according to the model , the star - forming galaxy contribution to the @xmath0-ray background is @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 the hubble parameter",
    ", @xmath43 is the ratio of atomic - to - molecular hydrogen density in star - forming galaxies ( see leroy et al .",

    "we use the model discussed in the previous section to fit the _ fermi_-lat egb . as already discussed , we first compute the contribution of blazars by fitting their _ fermi_-lat differential number counts ( abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) , then we add the background from non - beamed agns ( inoue et al .",
    "2008 ) , and finally we compute the contribution of galaxies by fitting the egb .",
    "we obtain the same best fit values ( within the errors ) if we perform a simultaneous fit to the number counts of blazars _ and _ to the background .",
    "results and numbers reported here refer to this second approach .",
    "we remark that the shape of the star - forming galaxies and blazar components are determined a priori , while only their normalizations are allowed to vary .",
    "the contribution of non - beamed agns is instead totally fixed .    in fig .",

    "the number ratio of blazars to radio galaxies @xmath32 can be thought as a measure of the beaming factor of the relativistic jet , which in turn is related to the bulk lorentz factor @xmath51 . from @xmath52",
    "we derive @xmath53 .",
    "we proposed a two parameter model for the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egb ) measured by _ fermi_-lat .",
    "we showed that the egb can be explained by a combination of blazars , non - beamed agns ( seyfert galaxies and qsos ) , and high energy photons originating by the interaction of cosmic rays and ism in star - forming galaxies .",
    "our egb model differs with respect to other existing similar studies ( e.g. , inoue & totani 2009 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2010a ; stecker & venters 2011 ) in the @xmath0-ray lf of blazars that we derive directly from the radio lf allowing only a free relative normalization ( i.e. , the lf faint and bright ends are fixed before fitting ) , and/or in the use of the fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sed instead of a simple power law parametrization of blazar high energy spectrum .",
    "we found that non - beamed agns dominate the egb below 0.2 gev , while blazars take over above 10 gev .",
    "cosmic ray emission is then needed at intermediate energies at a level @xmath54 of the total .",
    "our model parameters are the relative ratio of blazars to radio galaxies , and the absolute normalization of the contribution from star - forming galaxies .",
    "the best fit value of the relative number of blazars with respect to radio galaxies can be translated into a bulk lorentz factor of the relativistic jet @xmath53 , larger than the average value @xmath55 estimated by ghisellini et al .",
    "the two values could be reconciled if blazars commonly show secular @xmath0-ray large variability which modulates the 1-year average flux , as recently proposed by ghirlanda et al .",
    "our model fit to the egb constrains the so - called  star formation efficiency of molecular hydrogen \" , which we found well within existing , much looser observational constraints ( leroy et al .",
    "2008 ) .     as a function of particle mass @xmath56 for annihilating dm .",
    "the lower ( upper ) curve represents the 1(2)-@xmath57 limit .",
    "see text for details . ]    clearly , the specific best fit values obtained depend upon the details of our model , in terms of star formation rate adopted , models for the @xmath0-ray emission of star - forming galaxies , blazar lf and sed .",
    "nevertheless the overall picture appears quite robust , with an important role played by star - forming galaxies , with blazars dominating only at the higher energies probed by _ fermi_-lat .",
    "though our model is statistically fully acceptable , it is interesting to note that the highest data point of the egb ( see fig .",
    "2 , upper panel ) lies above our best fit model . in the energy band 50 - 100 gev absorption of @xmath0-rays due to the interaction with the ebl",
    "is significant .",
    "different theoretical ebl models have been proposed in the last few years ( e.g. , franceschini , rodighiero , & vaccari 2008 ; gilmore et al .",
    "2009 ; kneiske & dole 2010 ; finke et al . 2010 ; domnguez et al .",
    "2011 ) , resulting in somewhat different optical depth for photon - photon interaction .",
    "as already discussed , we follow finke et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and we checked that even adopting the model of kneiske & dole ( 2010 ) , which gives the lowest @xmath0-ray absorption , our egb model still falls short in the 70 - 100 gev range . a possible , intriguing explanation is the presence of an extra emission from annihilating dark matter ( dm ) particles ( see , e.g. , ullio et al .",
    "2002 ) . recently ,",
    "abazajian , blanchet , & harding ( 2010b ) performed a detailed analysis of possible dm candidates in the context of _",
    "fermi_-lat egb . a full discussion of dm particle contribution to the egb is beyond the scope of the present _",
    "letter_. for illustrative discussion , here we adopt a specific annihilating dm model , and compute its contribution to the egb .",
    "the @xmath0-ray background produced by annihilating dm is calculated following abazajian et al .",
    "( 2010b ) and ando ( 2005 ) .",
    "we found , as an example , that a particle of mass @xmath4 tev and cross section @xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 can easly accomodate the last data point .",
    "however its presence is not statistically required by the fit , so it is fair to consider only upper limits to the dm component .",
    "[ fig : dm ] shows our results in terms of cross section @xmath58 and particle mass @xmath56 .",
    "the lower ( upper ) curve is computed by adding the dm background to our egb model , allowing a @xmath59 increase of 1 ( 4 ) with respect to the best fit , hence representing the 1(2)-@xmath57 upper limits of @xmath58 for a given @xmath56 .",
    "as an example , assuming @xmath60 as required for leaving the observed relic density of dm ( jungman et al . 1996 ) , we can exclude at 1(2)-@xmath57 level dm particles with @xmath61gev .",
    "more massive particles can have a larger cross section , and still be compatible with egb data .",
    "our limits are consistent with other , more refined , determinations ( e.g. , abazajian et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "finally , it is worth asking whether dm particle annihilation signal could substitute the @xmath0-ray emission from star - forming galaxies in fitting the egb .",
    "we checked that the joint fit to blazar number counts and egb adopting an alternative three component model ( i.e. , blazars , non - beamed agns , and dm ) is statistically unacceptable ( @xmath62 for 28 d.o.f . , to be compared to @xmath63 for 29 d.o.f .",
    "as discussed in section 3 ) . we conclude that star - forming galaxies seem to be a necessary , and important , component of the egb , while dm is not strictly required .",
