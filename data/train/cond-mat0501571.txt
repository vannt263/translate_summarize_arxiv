    "even after many years of vivid interest , the structural glass transition is still an open and alive topic of research @xcite .",
    "being defined by a drastic slowing down of the equilibration time of a liquid , it is introduced as a dynamical , non - equilibrium phenomenon . up to",
    "now it is , however , one of the crucial questions if this slowing down is accompanied by an equilibrium glass transition or not .",
    "recently , lattice - gas models have played an increasing role in this discussion @xcite .",
    "the central idea of these models is to incorporate",
    "_ static geometrical constraints _ via hard - sphere interactions which restrict the possible particle packings and introduce some kind of geometrical frustration . defined on ( generalized )",
    "bethe lattices , these models are characterized by the existence of a dynamical glass transition , followed by a static one .",
    "these models are contrasted by the so - called _ kinetically constrained _",
    "models @xcite , in which not all particle moves are permitted , but which are characterized by a trivial thermodynamic equilibrium behavior . defined on a bethe lattice , they show , however , a very similar dynamical behavior to the above mentioned models @xcite .",
    "the model analyzed in this paper was introduced in @xcite , and it belongs to the class of geometrically constrained models .",
    "its equilibrium behavior will be analyzed in great detail using the cavity method @xcite .",
    "the model can be defined over any lattice or graph .",
    "sites are either occupied by particles , or they are empty .",
    "the particles are , however , too large to allow any two neighboring sites to be occupied simultaneously . in the presence of short loops in the lattice ,",
    "this hard - core exclusion is sufficient to create a very rich phase diagram , including a liquid , two different crystalline , a glassy and an unusual , crystalline glassy phase . whereas this paper concentrates completely on the static properties of the model",
    ", a subsequent publication @xcite will consider the dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the model is defined .",
    "iii is dedicated to a description of an iterative method for the calculation of the partition function , or more precisely of effective local fields .",
    "iv solves this iterative method for the liquid - crystal transition , whereas secs .",
    "v and vi are dedicated to the glass phase .",
    "conclusion and outlook are given in the last section .",
    "the model was already introduced and studied in @xcite . in its most general formulation ,",
    "it is defined on a graph @xmath0 having vertices @xmath1 and undirected edges @xmath2 connecting pairs of vertices .",
    "vertices can either be empty , @xmath3 , or they are occupied by a particle , @xmath4 .",
    "these particles interact via a hard core of chemical radius one , i.e. neighboring vertices can not be occupied simultaneously by two particles . formulated in a more formal way , all edges @xmath5 fulfill the constraint @xmath6",
    ", i.e. one of the end vertices has to be empty .",
    "the model can thus be characterized by its grand - canonical partition function @xmath7 or its grand - canonical potential @xmath8 here we have introduced the chemical potential @xmath9 which is coupled to the total particle number @xmath10 and can thus be used to regulate the particle density @xmath11 note that the product over all edges in eq .",
    "( [ eq : partition_function ] ) serves as an indicator function for allowed particle configurations : whenever there is at least one pair of occupied adjacent vertices , the product vanishes and thus the configuration does not contribute to the partition function .",
    "note also that due to the hard - core interaction between particles the temperature does not play any role in the model , without loss of generality it is set to one .",
    "so far , the model is still defined on a general graph . in this work",
    "we will concentrate on ( generalized ) bethe lattices .",
    "bethe lattices can be defined in two different ways :    * the first definition considers a bethe lattice as an infinite regular tree , i.e. a cycle - free graph of fixed vertex degree ( or coordination number ) @xmath12 . the hard - sphere model on this graph",
    "was first considered by runnels @xcite . * as a second possibility we can define a bethe lattice as a random @xmath13-regular graph of @xmath14 vertices , with @xmath15 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this version is frequently used in the context of glassy systems @xcite , and allows in particular for the simulation of finite systems .",
    "locally , both systems are equivalent due to the fixed vertex degree , the case @xmath16 together with a possible particle packing is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig_bethegitter ] .",
    "the crucial difference results from the existence of cycles in random graphs : even if these are of length @xmath17 , i.e. their length diverges for large @xmath14 , they are in general inconsistent with the crystalline structure which will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec_glstatik ] . a densest particle packing on a bethe lattice defined as an infinite tree consists of an alternation of occupied and empty sites . in random regular graphs ,",
    "many cycles of odd length exist , preventing this alternating configuration from being globally feasible .",
    "a way out of this dilemma will be discussed later on .",
    "realistic , i.e. finite - dimensional , systems contain , however , many short cycles . to imitate this",
    ", we generalize bethe lattices in the following way , cf . also fig .",
    "[ fig_allgbethe ] : the graph is composed of cliques , i.e. fully connected subgraphs of @xmath18 vertices each . in each vertex , @xmath12 of these cliques merge , such that the resulting graph has constant vertex degree @xmath19 .",
    "the global structure resembles , however , a bethe lattice : we assume that besides the loops inside the cliques there are no other short cycles .",
    "note that ordinary bethe lattices are obtained in the special case @xmath20 , which is included in the following discussion of the general case .",
    "also generalized bethe lattices can be defined in the two ways discussed above , with similar consequences on the global feasibility of locally dense packings .",
    "the direct calculation of the partition function is complicated .",
    "it can , however , be achieved via an iterative method .",
    "for doing so , we shall introduce the notation of a _ rooted subtree _ : imagine one of the cliques containing a vertex @xmath21 to be removed from the graph , then a rooted subtree consists of the connected component containing @xmath21 .",
    "the vertex @xmath21 itself is denoted as the root of the subtree , cf .",
    "[ fig_betherek ] .",
    "note that the root has only @xmath22 neighbors , whereas all other vertices in the subtree have degree @xmath23 . for each of these rooted trees we introduce two restricted partition functions : @xmath24 denotes the partition function with @xmath25 fixed to zero , whereas @xmath26 corresponds to an occupied root .",
    "given @xmath27 rooted trees ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , these can be composed according to fig .",
    "[ fig_betherek ] to form one new rooted tree with root @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the double index is introduced to lighten the notation in the following equations : the first index defines the ( removed ) clique containing the root , whereas @xmath32 enumerates the vertices within this clique .",
    "the restricted partition function of the new tree can now be easily inferred from those of the @xmath22 original ones :    [ gl_rekzsumme ]    @xmath33    the expression in the brackets stands for the contribution of one branch : in case that the root @xmath34 is empty , up to one of the neighbors in each branch can be occupied .",
    "if , on the other hand , the root is occupied , none of its neighbors is allowed to be occupied .",
    "the additional factor @xmath35 in the second equation takes into account the chemical potential acting on the root particle .",
    "introducing now the _ cavity fields _ @xmath36 ( more precisely , @xmath37 defines a local field coupled to @xmath38 ) , we find @xmath39 in order to understand the thermodynamic behavior of our model , we have to find appropriate solutions to these equations . in the next section , we shall discuss the case of the transition toward an ordered , crystalline phase , whereas sec .",
    "[ chap_1rsb ] is dedicated to glassy solutions .    before doing so",
    ", we have to clarify the physical meaning of @xmath40 and its connection to observables of the system .",
    "a simple observable is given by the local density @xmath41 of vertex @xmath34 .",
    "this quantity can be obtained by composing rooted subtrees as well . in the original graph",
    ", each vertex has , however , @xmath23 neighbors . within one iteration step ,",
    "this can be achieved by merging @xmath13 instead of @xmath32 branches .",
    "denoting the corresponding partition functions by @xmath42 , we get    @xmath43    this results in @xmath44 i.e. physical observables can be directly calculated from the cavity fields .",
    "to solve eq .",
    "( [ gl_lokfeldrek ] ) , we have to restrict the solution space by considering the limiting cases @xmath45 . for the moment",
    "we discuss only the first case for the definition of the generalized bethe lattice , i.e. we exclude the existence of long loops which may have some influence on the global packing structure .",
    "the limiting case of an empty ( or very dilute ) system ( @xmath46 ) is characterized by a spatially homogeneous density describing a _ liquid _ phase .",
    "consequently , the cavity fields are all equal to some @xmath47 given self - consistently by @xmath48 .    in the limit @xmath49",
    "we have to search for close - packings of the system . in these",
    "every clique carries exactly one particle , due to their regular structure these configurations are to be considered as being _",
    "crystalline_. the number of these configurations is exponential in the size of the graph ( _ i.e. _ the number of sites ) , as can be seen easily : initializing the configuration by putting one particle on an arbitrary vertex , all neighboring vertices have to be free .",
    "the @xmath50 second neighbors are partitioned into @xmath51 cliques of @xmath52 vertices each , and each of these cliques can carry exactly one particle - so there are @xmath53 possible configurations for selecting the particle positions in between the second neighbors .",
    "iterating this argument , we obviously find an exponential number of close - packings .",
    "selecting one close - packing , we can identify two sub - lattices : the first is formed by the occupied vertices ( 1-lattice ) , the second by the empty vertices ( 0-lattice ) .",
    "we introduce two cavity fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the sub - lattices .",
    "note that a more general ansatz that works with @xmath18 different cavity fields corresponding one to each site of a clique might lead to more complicated scenarios on @xmath56-partite graphs .",
    "it can be shown , however , that the cavity fields can only take two different values .",
    "we conclude that at least for the case @xmath57 no extra solution appears .    for the iteration of @xmath54 and @xmath55 we have to distinguish two cases , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_ocemiter ] : either the root belongs to the 1-lattice , and has only neighbors from the 0-lattice , or it belongs to the 0-lattice , and has exactly one 1-neighbor and @xmath58 0-neighbors in each clique .",
    "the resulting equations thus read :    [ gl_lfrekallg ]    @xmath59    where the presented block of variables has to be repeated @xmath32 times in the argument of @xmath60 .",
    "the permutation symmetry of variables inside one block is already used here .",
    "the equations can be rewritten explicitly as    [ gl_lfrekcry ]    @xmath61    using eq .",

    "[ gl_lsgstatik ] , coming first back to the liquid solution .",

    "let us shortly summarize the case @xmath20 where we have an ordinary bethe lattice .",
    "we have found that at @xmath112 a crystalline solution appears continuously from the liquid one , i.e. we find a second - order crystallization transition .",
    "for @xmath113 , with @xmath114 , the liquid solution is the only one , and thus globally stable . for @xmath115 ,",
    "this solution becomes locally unstable , and two stable crystalline states exist .",
    "they are connected to each other by exchanging the two sub - lattices . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the system approaches one of its ground states which is given by a periodic alternation of occupied and empty sites .    in the case of a generalized bethe - lattice ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath116 , the situation is slightly more involved .",
    "below the spinodal point @xmath82 only the liquid solution exists , it thus describes the globally stable solution .",
    "it exists , however , also for larger chemical potentials and , up to @xmath117 ( as defined in the last paragraph ) , it remains at least locally stable under small perturbations .    at @xmath82 two other ,",
    "crystalline solutions appear .",
    "the first one has always @xmath118 , and the global density is larger than the liquid one .",
    "this solution is always locally stable , as can be shown by analyzing the relaxational dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "the second crystalline solution starts with the same sub - lattice densities at the spinodal point , but its global density first decreases . in addition",
    "it is initially locally unstable , hence unphysical . at @xmath119 , however , both sub - lattice densities become equal , @xmath120 , and exactly at this point it thus coincides with the liquid solution . beyond @xmath117 ,",
    "the new solution becomes locally stable , and thus takes over the local stability from the liquid solution .",
    "since both @xmath121-curves touch in this point with the same slope but different curvature , the corresponding transition there is of _ third order_. the crystalline solution becomes also in some other aspect quite particular : the sub - lattice densities now fulfill @xmath122 , i.e. every clique has @xmath52 vertices of higher , and one vertex of lower density !",
    "note that this transition exists only if the global density @xmath123 can be reached .",
    "every clique can be occupied by at most one particle , the density is thus restricted to values @xmath124 . a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the inverse crystalline solution",
    "is thus given by @xmath125 .",
    "for all @xmath93 we thus find two locally stable solutions , and we have to consider the grand - canonical potentials in order to decide which solution is the globally stable one . for @xmath116 , the liquid solution remains the thermodynamically relevant one up to some @xmath126 , above which the first crystalline solution has the minimal @xmath98 ; a first - order freezing transition occurs .",
    "the second crystalline solution has never the globally minimal grand - canonical potential , but it crosses the one of the liquid solution at @xmath117 , verifying thus the results of the local stability analysis .",
    "it has to be remarked that in the case of ordinary bethe - lattices , i.e. @xmath20 , the equations are symmetric with respect to @xmath78 and @xmath77 , thus normal and inverse crystallization are indistinguishable .",
    "we can therefore consider this case as a degenerate one , where the crystalline and the inverse crystalline solutions appear in the same moment , and thus @xmath127 holds .",
    "we want to illustrate this behavior in a specific example .",
    "the system of minimal @xmath32 and @xmath52 showing inverse crystallization has @xmath128 and @xmath86 .",
    "we therefore concentrate on these values .",
    "the phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig_rhostat ] , the grand - canonical potential per clique is shown in fig .  [ fig_grosspot ] .",
    "for small @xmath9 , only the liquid phase exists . at @xmath129 a crystalline solution with sub - lattice densities @xmath130 , @xmath131 and global density @xmath132 appears .",
    "up to @xmath133 , the liquid phase remains however the thermal equilibrium of our model .",
    "for all @xmath9 above @xmath134 , the crystalline solution of higher density becomes the globally stable one , i.e. at @xmath134 the systems undergoes a first - order crystallization transition .",
    "the liquid solution stays , however , also locally stable beyond @xmath134 , and in absence of sufficiently strong perturbations the system remains liquid also for higher @xmath9 . only at @xmath135",
    "it loses its local stability in a third - order transition to an inverse crystalline state with @xmath136 .",
    "note that the density curves of the liquid and the second crystalline solution only touch at @xmath117 , the inverse crystalline density is slightly larger than the liquid one , whereas the grand - canonical potentials cross each other with equal slopes .    at this point",
    "we have to remark that the entropy @xmath137 of the inverse crystalline solution vanishes at @xmath138 , and it becomes therefore unphysical at higher chemical potentials . using a slight generalization of the 1rsb formalism introduced in the next section , we find for @xmath139 the existence of a solution that corresponds to a _ crystalline glass phase _ ( cf .",
    "section [ sec_cryglass ] ) which seems appropriate to solve the entropy crisis .",
    "thus , the inverse crystallization is relevant only in an interval @xmath140 with @xmath141 .      to test our analytical results on the crystallization transitions ,",
    "we have performed monte - carlo simulations .",
    "these are naturally performed on finite lattices , and a natural finite analog of the bethe lattice defined as an infinite tree is provided by regular random graphs . as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , their large scale structure contains random loops which are not compatible with any division into 0- and 1-sub - lattices .",
    "this can be circumvented by imposing the consistency with the crystalline structure by generating , e.g. , a random regular bipartite graph by grouping the vertices into two subsets of sizes @xmath14 and @xmath142 , and by introducing cliques only in between one vertex from the first and @xmath52 vertices from the second subset .",
    "note that also these graphs have an important difference to the generalized bethe - lattices defined as infinite graphs which survives even in the thermodynamic limit : the first graphs allow only for exactly one partition into 0- and 1-lattices , whereas the second definition allows for an exponential number of such partitions .",
    "this difference is meaningful for stability properties of the system .",
    "it can be shown in numerical simulations that even when going to @xmath56-partite graphs , that allow for @xmath18 partitions , the inverse crystalline phase becomes unstable .    in the mc simulations we have included the following microscopic processes : particles are mobile , i.e.  they are allowed to move to neighboring sites whenever these are empty and do not have further occupied neighbors ( hard - core constraint ) , and the system is coupled to a particle bath such that particles can be generated or deleted . the rates for the last two processes have to be related by detailed balance , i.e. they have ratio @xmath35 , in order to guarantee equilibration .",
    "first , we have tested our predictions for the normal crystal phase on large graphs of @xmath143 vertices .",
    "we have started the experiment in one densest packing , and then decreased the chemical potential with a rate of @xmath144 , and close to @xmath82 with @xmath145 , starting with @xmath146 .",
    "a further decrease in the decompactification rate did not alter the results , so we can expect thermal equilibrium . the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig_comp ] shows , that the results are in perfect agreement with the analytical ones , in particular the discontinuous decrease of the density at the spinodal point is demonstrated with very high precision .",
    "the results for the inverse crystallization were tested by starting with an empty system which was compactified in a first step to @xmath147 where only the liquid phase and no crystalline phases exist .",
    "the system was compactified by increasing @xmath9 in discrete steps with two very small rates , @xmath148 and @xmath149 . due to this slow dynamics",
    "we have also used a slightly smaller system of @xmath150 vertices .",
    "the results are represented in the right of figs .",
    "[ fig_comp ] .",
    "the first observation is that , for small @xmath9 , numerical and analytical data coincide impressively : we find the liquid phase with equal sub - lattice densities for @xmath151 and a transition to the inverse crystalline phase at @xmath152 , as predicted in the last section . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the results depend on the compaction rate , underlining the glassy character of the corresponding phase .",
    "it is also observed that the global density is smaller than the inverse crystalline one , which mainly results from a lower sublattice density on the 0-lattice .",
    "we mention that besides the transition from the liquid to the inverse crystalline phase which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_comp ] ( right ) , there is a certain probability for the system to undergo a transition to the normal crystalline phase with @xmath118 when compacted beyond @xmath117 .",
    "the dependence of this probability on the compaction rate and on the system size might be an interesting subject of further investigation .",
    "in the last section , we have already seen that the simple crystalline ansatz of two cavity fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 for solving the iterative eq .",
    "[ gl_lokfeldrek ] leads to inconsistencies for large @xmath9 .",
    "the entropy of the inverse crystalline solution , which describes a metastable phase , becomes negative at finite @xmath9 , and the solution is not physical any more . frequently zero - entropy points can be understood as an indicator for the existence of a glass transition at some smaller value of the chemical potential , and thus a more general solution ansatz has to be considered .",
    "the situation is even more drastic if we consider random regular graphs as realizations of bethe lattices .",
    "as already discussed , they are locally isomorphic to a tree , but they contain random large - scale loops which are not consistent with any crystalline structure . in particular they do not allow for a coherent partition of the original graph into two subgraphs as discussed in the context of the crystalline solution , the system is frustrated .",
    "so far , for these graphs we have only the liquid solution which , however , is in contradiction to numerical results for large @xmath9 .",
    "we therefore have to consider the possibility of the existence of a glassy high - density phase , or , in technical terms , we have to search for a replica symmetry broken solution ( rsb ) . on the level of one - step rsb ( 1rsb )",
    "this can be achieved most easily using the cavity approach @xcite , as developed for finite - connectivity systems in @xcite , and used also in @xcite for a similar lattice gas model .",

    "this is of course not feasible if only the 1rsb solution is explicitly known . in this case",
    "one can show the local stability of the 1rsb solution toward 2rsb which is believed to be a good indication for the correctness of the 1rsb solution as no example for a discontinuous transition from 1rsb to rsb of higher levels is known so far .",
    "it was shown be montanari and ricci - tersenghi that there are two possible kinds of instabilities that may occur @xcite .",
    "these result from two different descriptions of a 1rsb solution within the 2rsb formalism .",
    "one way is to assume the existence of a single trivial cluster where the states are given by @xmath347 , with @xmath348 being the 1rsb solution .",
    "thus we have @xmath343= \\delta[p - p^*]$ ] and the corresponding instability can be detected by making the ansatz @xmath343 = f[p - p^*]$ ] where @xmath349 is a functional with support around the null function .",
    "this corresponds to an assembling of the states that organize in clusters .",
    "the process is called _ aggregation of states _ and the instability is classified type i. the second possibility consists in encoding the field distribution @xmath347 in the cluster structure while the states are trivial . for discrete @xmath348",
    "we write @xmath350 with @xmath351 .",
    "the cluster structure is then given by @xmath343 = \\sum_a p_a \\delta[p-\\delta_a]$ ] and the instability is detected by @xmath343 = \\sum_a p_a f_a[p-\\delta_a]$ ] with @xmath352 having support around the null function . at the instability",
    "each state can be considered as a germ giving birth to a cluster .",
    "the process is called _ fragmentation of states _ and the instability is classified type ii .",
    "we shall not stress on the details of the concrete calculations which can be found in the literature for various models including combinatorial problems @xcite .    in order to investigate the stability of the 1rsb solution in the close - packing limit ( @xmath49 ) we focus on the type - i instability .",
    "we note that there is a strong analogy between the calculation of the spin - glass instability , which was detected by putting @xmath353 where @xmath349 is a smeared @xmath240-function , and the ansatz @xmath343 = f[p - p^*]$ ] suitable to find the type i instability . by transporting the calculations for the spin - glass instability to the next higher level in the rsb hierarchy the stability criterion @xmath354 , which reads precisely like eq . , has been derived by rivoire _",
    "_ @xcite . here",
    "@xmath355 is the eigenvalue of greatest modulus of the matrix @xmath356 which is the jacobian matrix associated with the iteration of the 1rsb field distributions eq . .    a computation of @xmath355 yields that we have latexmath:[$k p\\ ,    @xmath299 for all the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_closep ] , _ i.e. _ the 1rsb solution is locally unstable toward 2rsb .",
    "we can conclude that the results for @xmath317 and @xmath319 that were derived in the 1rsb context are not exact . following the general belief that the instability of a 1rsb solution indicates _ frsb _",
    ", this would even mean @xmath358 for @xmath49 , which is not suggested by the numerical findings . it must however be considered that a system can not be brought instantaneously to infinite @xmath9 via numerical compaction . under the action of a mc - algorithm",
    "the simulated system will pass through a chain of genuine non - equilibrium states . by mapping these on equilibrium states according to their density",
    "we can approximately attribute a chemical potential @xmath359 to the system .",
    "it might seem more adequate to rely on a stability analysis of the 1rsb solution for @xmath197 in order to decide if the compacted system is governed by metastable states .",
    "unfortunately , this analysis seems to be out of reach for present analytical techniques .",
    "to conclude , we have investigated in great detail the thermodynamic behavior of a hard - sphere lattice gas model on generalized bethe lattices .    on usual bethe lattices , which do not contain ( short ) loops , the model shows a very simple behavior : at low density , the system is found in a liquid phase , and the local density is homogeneous . at a certain point ,",
    "the system undergoes a second - order freezing transition .",
    "the character of this transition depends on the global graph structure : the frozen phase is either crystalline ( if long loops of odd length are almost absent in the graph ) , or it is given by a spin - glass phase ( if the bethe lattice is defined as a regular random graph , and the crystalline structure is inconsistent with the large - scale structure of the graph ) .",
    "the introduction of short loops changes this behavior drastically .",
    "we have therefore studied generalized bethe lattices , which are locally characterized by the existence of many short loops , but on a coarse - grained level form locally tree - like hyper - graphs .",
    "this mixed structure allows for an analytical solution of the hard - sphere lattice gas .",
    "again , the low - density phase describes a spatially homogeneous liquid .",
    "if compactified , the system undergoes either a first - order crystallization transition or a discontinuous glass transition which is characterized by a broken replica symmetry , and by the existence of an exponentially large number of metastable states .",
    "we also find more exotic high - density phases which are at least metastable and can thus be found also in numerical simulations .",
    "the first of these phases is an inverse - crystalline one .",
    "its sublattice densities are inverted , as compared to the densest crystalline packing . for even higher density",
    ", this phase becomes unstable with respect to a crystalline glass transition : even if the local densities are frozen to random values , their distributions are organized in a regular , i.e. inverse crystalline manner .",
    "this means that hard - sphere lattice gases on generalized bethe lattices may serve as valid , microscopically motivated and analytically tractable mean - field models for the glass transition . do they , however , also present good approximations to the behavior in low dimensions ?",
    "the hard - sphere model is in fact well studied on various two- and three - dimensional lattices , the most famous cases are the hard - hexagon model and its solution by the corner - transfer matrix @xcite , and the three - dimensional cubic lattice @xcite which can be analyzed by means of series expansions .",
    "these two cases show second - order crystallization transitions . in @xcite",
    "we have , however , introduced a finite - dimensional lattice mimicking the structure of the generalized bethe lattice , and this model shows in fact a glass - like slowing down .",
    "the latter is , however , much less pronounced due to the existence of activated processes in finite dimensions .    at this point ,",
    "another remark concerning the relation of the generalized bethe - lattice models to @xmath52-spin glass models is necessary .",
    "the latter model class was extensively used in particular in the last decade in the context of the glass transition @xcite . on one hand , they allow for an analytical treatment of the model statics and dynamics , the latter being formally equivalent to the mode - coupling approach to more realistic glass - forming liquids . @xmath52-spin glasses are , however , completetly missing a microscopic motivation .",
    "one point here is the existence of unphysical multi - spin interactions .",
    "if we look , however , to our generalized bethe - lattice model , the introduction of cliques effectively introduces multi - site interactions  only one site per clique can be occupied  even if these are defined via groups of pair interactions .",
    "this allows to reinterprete also the @xmath52-spin interactions in spin - glass models as a kind of coarse grained effective interaction .",
    "all the considerations in this paper are restricted to the thermodynamic , i.e.  equilibrium behavior of the model .",
    "in particular in the glassy regions , we know that the dynamics becomes very slow , and the system is practically always out of equilibrium .",
    "the analytical description of the dynamics of finite - connectivity models is , however , a much more involved problem , and it is to a large extent an unsolved one . in a subsequent publication , we will confront our findings on the static behavior with an approximate analysis of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the approach taken there is related to a projective approximation scheme introduced in @xcite in the context of algorithms for combinatorial optimization , and then applied to simple ising ferromagnets in @xcite . within this scheme , the dynamics",
    "is projected to the dynamics of a small set of global observables , and the resulting equations are closed on the basis of a pseudo - equilibrium ansatz in an enlarged ensemble .",
    "the selection of this generalized ensemble , and the technical realization of the projection are based on the tools developed in this article , and therefore will form a natural continuation of the present work .",
