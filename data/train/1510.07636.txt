    "understanding the behavior of supercooled liquids and the process of glass formation represents one of the major challenges in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "glass - forming systems exhibit a dramatic slowdown of the dynamics upon mild supercooling or compression , but at the same time undergo only subtle structural changes at the atomic level .",
    "the question how such marginal differences in structure can be accompanied by an orders - of - magnitude change in the relaxation dynamics lies at the heart of the glass - transition problem .",
    "while several plausible theoretical frameworks have been developed to rationalize this behavior @xcite , there is still no fully microscopic theory available that can accurately describe the dynamics of supercooled liquids over all relevant time and temperature scales .    among the various frameworks proposed in the last few decades , the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) of the glass transition stands out as the only theory of glassy dynamics based entirely on first principles @xcite .",
    "mct seeks to predict the dynamics of the time - dependent density - density correlation function @xmath0 at wavelength @xmath1 and time @xmath2 using only time - independent structural properties , such as the static structure factor @xmath3 , as input . within the mct framework ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 is governed by a memory function involving ( projected ) dynamic _ four_-point correlation functions , which probe correlations between pair - density modes .",
    "the crucial mct approximation is to factorize these four - point correlations into products of @xmath0 s , thus rendering a closed , self - consistent theory .",
    "the most notable success of mct is that it correctly predicts the growth of a plateauing region in @xmath0 upon supercooling , and it offers a simple physical picture for the initial phase of the dynamic slow - down in terms of the cage effect @xcite .",
    "with rescaling of temperature or density , the theory can also be made quantitatively successful in the weakly to moderately supercooled regime @xcite .",
    "however , the uncontrolled nature of the factorization approximation ultimately breaks down , leading to the prediction of a spurious dynamical transition at temperatures well above the experimentally observed glass transition ( see for reviews e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a promising approach to improve upon standard mct was first introduced by szamel in 2003 @xcite .",
    "this approach , which we refer to as generalized mode - coupling theory ( gmct ) , relies on the fact that the exact time evolution of the four - point correlations is governed by six - point correlations , which in turn are controlled by eight - point correlations , and so on .",
    "this leads to a _ hierarchy _ of coupled equations that makes it possible to delay the uncontrolled factorization approximation to a later stage .",
    "szamel @xcite and wu and cao @xcite showed that applying the factorization at the level of six- or eight - point correlations indeed systematically improves the predicted location of the dynamical transition . in a subsequent proof - of - principle study ,",
    "two of us @xcite extended this approach to _ infinite _ order using a simplified schematic ( wavevector - independent ) model .",
    "remarkably , it was found that this infinite hierarchy of schematic gmct equations admits an analytical solution that rounds off the mct transition completely , and converts the power - law divergences of transport coefficients into activated - like behavior .",
    "more recently , we found that infinite - order schematic gmct can in fact account for both strictly avoided and sharp standard - mct - like transitions , depending on the choice of the level - dependent schematic parameters @xcite .",
    "we also identified a class of schematic hierarchies out of which the concept of fragility , i.e.  the degree to which the relaxation - time growth deviates from arrhenius behavior @xcite , emerges naturally .",
    "this is to be contrasted with standard mct , which can only predict  fragile \" relaxation and hence fails to distinguish between materials with different fragilities .",
    "finally , it was recently shown that the fully microscopic version of the theory , which contains no free parameters and takes only static structural information as input , already gives unprecedented accuracy for the time - dependent dynamics of a realistic quasi - hard sphere system when only the lowest few levels of the hierarchy are considered @xcite .",
    "more specifically , full quantitative agreement could be obtained between gmct and computer simulations in the mildly supercooled regime , without having to resort to density or wavevector rescaling .",
    "these studies all suggest that gmct offers a promising and highly versatile framework to describe the behavior of glass - forming matter .",
    "since gmct can _ systematically _ correct upon standard mct by incorporating increasingly many higher - order correlations , the theory thus poses an appealing and potentially pragmatic route towards an ultimately fully quantitative and fully microscopic description of glassy dynamics over all relevant time and temperature domains .    despite these encouraging results ,",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear that the gmct approach , which seeks to systematically defer the uncontrolled mct factorization , is in itself controlled .",
    "indeed , a justified concern is whether the gmct hierarchy converges at all , since there exists no small parameter in the theory that would warrant higher - order contributions less important . in this work ,",
    "we seek to address this question using both analytical and numerical arguments . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict our discussion to the case of schematic gmct hierarchies , but we expect our qualitative results and conclusions to apply to the microscopic theory as well . the model of ref.@xcite , which we will refer to here as the mayer - miyazaki - reichman model , offers an ideal test ground for this purpose , since a unique analytic solution is at hand for the infinite - order limit .",
    "for completeness , we shall first present the full derivation of this highly non - trivial solution ( the final result of which was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and subsequently consider various _",
    "finite_-level closures of this hierarchy .",
    "it will be shown rigorously , through a rather lengthy derivation , that the finite - order solutions converge systematically towards the analytic infinite - order result as the closure level tends to infinity .",
    "we then provide numerical evidence that a similar convergence pattern also applies to more generic gmct hierarchies , such that the inclusion of more hierarchical levels directly translates into accurate dynamics over increasingly long time scales .",
    "this suggests that the gmct approach is indeed controlled in the sense that , _ independent of closure method _ , the dynamics described by a finite level of the hierarchy coincides with that of the complete hierarchy for an ever increasing time duration .",
    "finally , we seek to provide more physical insight into how the influence of higher - order correlations dissipates through the gmct hierarchy to ultimately control the dynamics of @xmath0 . to this end",
    ", we will make a connection between infinite schematic hierarchies and the standard - mct @xmath4 model @xcite , and discuss how the functional forms of the level - dependent schematic parameters control whether the transition is continuous (  type - a `` ) , discontinuous (  type - b '' ) , or strictly avoided .",
    "overall , this work can help to assess the success of gmct as a first - principles - based theory of the glass transition .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first review the fully microscopic gmct equations in sec .",

    "these vertices are defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denotes the direct correlation function , which is related to the static structure factor as @xmath23 / \\rho$ ] @xcite .",
    "the latter serves as the _ only input _ to the theory ( aside from trivial system parameters such as @xmath17 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "clearly , the hierarchical nature of the gmct equations arises from the memory kernel : for any given level @xmath7 , the memory function contains @xmath7 different dynamic 2(@xmath24)-point correlators .",
    "it should be noted that the time dependence of these dynamic 2(@xmath24)-point correlators occurs in a subspace _ orthogonal _ to the @xmath7-point density - mode basis that spans the 2@xmath7-point correlation functions .",
    "however , one may always project the @xmath7-point density components out of the multilinear ( @xmath24)-point density basis , so that the @xmath25-point correlation functions evolve in the orthogonal subspace _ by construction _ @xcite .",
    "hence , it is sensible to treat the evolution with  normal \" dynamics .",
    "the remaining approximations in our framework are the neglect of the off - diagonal dynamic @xmath5-point correlation functions @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and the use of gaussian and convolution approximations for the statics .",
    "note that these approximations are also commonly invoked at the standard - mct level . in principle",
    ", one could relax both of these approximations , i.e. , incorporate more off - diagonal dynamic correlators and keep all static correlators in their explicit multi - point form .",
    "such higher - order statics would then serve as additional input to the theory .",
    "the gmct equations of motion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmcteqphi_n ] ) are subject to the boundary conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29 for all @xmath7 .",
    "our schematic gmct equations involve several simplifications of the microscopic hierarchy presented in the previous section . following refs .",

    "we also replace @xmath33 , which represents the effective weight of the memory kernel at level @xmath7 .",
    "this brings the memory functions into the form @xmath34 .",
    "finally , we assume that the density correlation functions decay so slowly that the second time - derivatives can be neglected ( i.e. , overdamped dynamics ) , and we set the friction constant @xmath11 to 1 .",
    "note that the latter simply amounts to a rescaling of time . under these assumptions ,",

    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : conv_genmodels ] indicates that the mean - field closures do not always give an upper bound to the dynamics .",

    "there is , however , also an important general convergence pattern that emerges from the data in fig .",

    "this is a general trend that is observed across the various models considered here , and implies that a perturbative approach is warranted : by systematically incorporating more higher - order contributions , the predicted dynamics systematically converges , over increasingly long time scales , upon a single infinite - order solution that is exact up to infinite times .",
    "we note that a similar notion of convergence was also recently found in microscopic gmct calculations of a quasi - hard sphere system , which could be performed up to closure level @xmath432 with all relevant wavevectors included @xcite .",
    "altogether , these results provide compelling evidence that gmct hierarchies are _ generally convergent _ , even though no small parameter exists in the theory .      as a final part of our discussion ,",
    "let us elaborate on how the choice of @xmath412 parameters governs the nature of the predicted glass transition within the infinite - order framework .",
    "as already discussed in ref.@xcite on general grounds , the asymptotic behavior of the parameters in the @xmath433 limit determines whether the transition is sharp or avoided : if there is a sharp transition at a finite critical point @xmath434 , we have @xmath435 , so that the series for @xmath215 diverges at @xmath246 .",
    "conversely , if the transition is rigorously avoided so that the correlation functions ultimately decay to zero for all @xmath49 , we have @xmath436 .",

    "hence , @xmath442 may be interpreted as a fragility parameter @xcite .",
    "note that the case @xmath444 would recover the hierarchy ( [ lin_model ] ) with @xmath445 , which thus represents a  transitional \" scenario between avoided and sharp type - b transitions .",

    "the plot of the ratio @xmath446 immediately reveals the nature of sharp ( type - a or type - b ) glass transitions : the coupling constants @xmath42 remain of _ the same order of magnitude _ as the bare frequencies @xmath41 ( or @xmath449 ) as @xmath7 tends towards infinity .",
    "that is , when a system is driven into the glass state through a sharp transition , _ all _ higher - order memory terms , up to @xmath433 , contribute approximately equally at criticality ( after normalizing with respect to the bare frequencies ) .",

    "[ fig : params_genmodels ] for the infinite @xmath4-gmct hierarchy , which suggests that all @xmath453 play an important role in the @xmath4 model ?",
    "the answer is simple : all @xmath453 contributions in the @xmath4-gmct model are necessary to ultimately yield a @xmath454 _ that behaves numerically exactly as _",

    "for which _ all _ higher - order correlations rigorously vanish , we simply obtain fast exponential decay for @xmath214 and thus recover the normal - liquid regime .    finally , let us recall that the relative importance of the higher - order correlations can also control the degree of fragility : the smaller the value of @xmath442 in the hierarchy of eq .",

    "<S> we present an extensive treatment of the generalized mode - coupling theory ( gmct ) of the glass transition , which seeks to describe the dynamics of glass - forming liquids using only static structural information as input . </S>",
    "<S> this theory amounts to an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for multi - point density correlations , the lowest - order closure of which is equivalent to standard mode - coupling theory . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on simplified schematic gmct hierarchies , which lack any explicit wavevector - dependence and therefore allow for greater analytical and numerical tractability . </S>",
    "<S> for one particular schematic model , we derive the unique analytic solution of the infinite hierarchy , and demonstrate that closing the hierarchy at finite order leads to uniform convergence as the closure level increases . </S>",
    "<S> we also show numerically that a similarly robust convergence pattern emerges for more generic schematic gmct models , suggesting that the gmct framework is generally convergent , even though no small parameter exists in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how different effective weights on the high - order contributions ultimately control whether the transition is continuous , discontinuous , or strictly avoided , providing new means to relate structure to dynamics in glass - forming systems . </S>"
