    "the effective theory is also a sine - gordon model as eq .",
    "( [ eq : boso - strong ] ) , but with @xmath102 for not too large applied magnetic field",

    "indeed , esr absorption intensity is proportional to an autocorrelation function of @xmath103 , but this operator is vanishing in the strong coupling limit according to ( [ eq : strong ] ) and in the weak coupling limit it is mixing the symmetric and the antisymmetric modes , thus complicating the interpretation of the spectra .",

    "[ sec : raman ] that raman scattering intensity measurements give a direct access to these breather modes in the ladder systems .",

    "the latter result , however , may result from having relatively large gaps that make the continuum limit unjustified .",
    "however , in this scenario , we have to understand why there is a state degenerate with the second breather in the sector @xmath243 .",
    "the second possibility is that the expression  ( [ eq : raman - strgcpl ] ) , which is valid for @xmath276 has corrections of order @xmath277 with @xmath263 an integer coming from higher order virtual processes .",
    "if these higher order correction terms contain an operator such as @xmath278 or @xmath279 the bosonized form of which are repectively @xmath280 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , the raman operator will contain soliton creation / annihilation operators .",
    "this scenario could explain the presence of the peak , while preserving the identification of the state s on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] as a soliton .",
    "moreover , this scenario is also compatible with the decrease of the weight in the peak s as @xmath202 is decreased .",
    "note however that , in this appealing scenario , a question remains : why is the b2 breather odd w.r.t .",
    "the _ inversion _",
    "symmetry in contrast to the other breathers ? solving this puzzle unfortunately requires to go beyond the sine - gordon model ( [ eq : boso - strong ] ) which does not exhibit such a symmetry .",
    "the third possibility is that the antisymmetric modes discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak ] are also contributing to the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] when @xmath283 even at energy scales small compared to @xmath24 . in that case , the continuum field theory method of sec .",
    "[ sec : strong ] would be useless to understand the spectra as it implicitely assumes that antisymmetric modes are excited only for energies comparable with @xmath24 .",
    "the fuller theory of sec .",
    "[ sec : weak ] would also be of limited usefulness as the resulting generalized sine - gordon model discussed in [ sec : weak ] is non - integrable and thus does not permit to locate breather type excitations .",
    "although the theoretical interpretation of the raman intensities obtained numerically at intermediate coupling in terms of the solitons and breather of the weak coupling sine - gordon theory is still a partially open problem , from the point of view of experiment , we can safely conclude that in a two - leg ladder with dzialoshinskii - moriya interaction , the presence of a gap in the magnetized phase gives rise to bound states observable in magnetic raman scattering . in the case of cuhpcl",
    ", earlier studies showed that typical parameters like @xmath284 ( as used in the numerics ) and @xmath285 ( all in units of @xmath24 ) give a fair description of the magnetization curve  @xcite and of the specific heat in an applied magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "hence , the above investigation of raman magnetic scattering ( based on analytic and numerical techniques ) clearly establishes that , for light polarization along the legs , at least two bound states should be visible , while at least a single bound state should be seen for light polarized along the rungs .",
    "we also expect that the spectral weight of the continuum predominantly appears at energies larger than typically @xmath271 i.e. , in the case of cuhpcl , above @xmath286  mev ( although the `` theoretical '' onset of the continuum is located just above the bound states as predicted by the sg description ) .",
    "in other words , a `` pseudo - gap '' should form between the bound states and @xmath271 . in the particular case of light polarized along the rungs",
    ", we further note that the bound state(s ) alone should exhaust most of the overall spectral weight .",
