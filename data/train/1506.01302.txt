    "many theoretical models exist to describe the valence parton distribution amplitude ( da ) of the @xmath1 , the @xmath0 ( both longitudinally and transversally polarized ) , and other mesons .",

    "we will present an amplification of the recent analysis by one of us in @xcite , continued in @xcite , for the pion and consider its extension to the longitudinally polarized @xmath0 meson ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "our primary findings to be discussed later can be summarized as follows : first , we provide more details about the structure of the sync - inspired shorttailed ( i.e. , endpoint - suppressed ) platykurtic ( pk ) @xmath1 da , proposed in @xcite , and quantify the uncertainties of its expansion coefficients .",
    "this da is a kind of chimera state because it mimics within the nlc - based approach characteristics pertaining to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) described in terms of dyson ",

    "the reason is that physical observables , like the pion - photon transition or the pion s electromagnetic form factor are given in terms of integrals of the das with smooth coefficient functions . because the leading - order anomalous dimensions of the involved operators in the matrix elements between the meson state and the vacuum are positive ( except @xmath50 ) , the higher coefficients are logarithmically suppressed at large scales , so that only @xmath51 survives",

    "in this section , we discuss the derivation of the @xmath26 da using qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates within the scheme developed in @xcite .",
    "the main conceptual idea is to apply the sum - rule method in combination with vacuum averages of nonlocal operators @xcite . following this rationale",
    ", one can determine the moments @xmath72 of a meson da using a sum rule with nonlocal condensates .",

    "this moment is an integral characteristic of the pion da and encodes information on the maximum possible weight of the higher - order conformal coefficients .",
    "moreover , it is particularly relevant for phenomenological applications because @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the leading - order ( lo ) expression of the pion - photon transition form factor , which has been measured in several experiments from a few gev@xmath24 up to 40  gev@xmath24 @xcite . here",

    ", we use @xmath97  gev@xmath24 .",

    "their explicit expressions can be found in appendix a of ref .",
    "the basic assumption here is that higher - order correlations are less important than two - particle correlations ( vacuum - dominance hypothesis @xcite ) .",

    "we will not repeat these details here .",
    "we concentrate instead on our primary goal to extract a platykurtic domain of these parameters .",
    "it turns out that this is possible even for the somewhat smaller value of the quark virtuality @xmath234  gev@xmath24 used originally for the extraction of the pion da in @xcite .",
    "the extracted domains are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhol ] in the form of the red slanted rectangles surrounded by the larger blue bands of coefficient values computed with the nlc sum rules .",
    "the left panel displays the results for the first two conformal coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 , whereas the right panel provides the areas of the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath67 . in both graphics the platykurtic model for the @xmath2 da",
    "is denoted by the symbol .",
    "the values of all these parameters , accompanied by their intrinsic errors , are compiled in table [ tab : parameters ] , while the platykurtic @xmath2 da profiles are displayed in the form of a narrow red strip in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - rho - das ] . for the sake of direct comparison with the dse results , all graphics and the values in the table are given at the reference scale @xmath28  gev@xmath24 after two - loop evolution .",
    "one immediately observes from this figure that , similar to the pion case , the platykurtic @xmath2 da has a single rounded central peak bearing endpoint suppression relative to the @xmath2 da obtained within the dse - based approach @xcite . in comparison to the platykurtic da of the pion ,",
    "it features a slightly narrower profile with the kurtosis value @xmath343 .",
    "tangible consequences of the platykurtic @xmath2 da will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we have performed an intensive study of the pion and the @xmath2 das within qcd , fortified with the knowledge of synchronization concepts used in the description of complex systems .",
    "these concepts provide a unifying rationale of _ how _ the various da profiles emerge instead of asking _",
    "they should have a particular shape , thus avoiding descriptive comparisons of das obtained with unrelated theoretical frameworks .",
    "furthermore , guided by these concepts , we have used controlled theory tools to obtain a new kind of chimera das for the pion and the @xmath2 meson using qcd sum rules with nlcs .",
    "these das are capable of mingling in situ the best of both worlds  endpoint suppression via nlc and unimodality due to dcsb , giving rise to shorttailed platykurtic profiles and realizing the scenario illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : oxymoron ] , while preserving the asymptotic @xmath245 behavior predicted by perturbative qcd . in the sync picture",
    ", they correspond to a vast number of phase - locked oscillators between the lower and the upper quartile of the @xmath245 distribution , whereas oscillators with extremely high or low `` frequencies '' , located close to the tails @xmath287 , are in limbo .",
    "while the characteristics of these new das in the central @xmath245 region resemble the gross behavior of dse - based das , their suppressed tails are following the same trend as the bms das .",
    "in mathematical terms , the bms - like das and the platykurtic ones are very different as regards their profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - rho - das ] ) and gegenbauer coefficients ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhol ] and table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "but from the nlc point of view , the bimodal bms @xmath1 das and the bimodal @xmath2 da of @xcite , which in the sync analogy correspond to two clusters of synchronized oscillators , are on the same theoretical footing as the unimodal shorttailed platykurtic das for these mesons , which unite the phase - locked oscillators in a single group .",
    "moreover , in the pion case they yield coinciding predictions for the pion - photon transition form factor which agree well with all available experimental data compatible with qcd scaling above @xmath344  gev@xmath24 .",
    "given all these results , we do nt want to stretch the importance of unimodality too far .",
    "too broad das with downward concave profiles encompassing the tails , as those derived for mesons with the aid of dses @xcite , imply that there is no particular @xmath245 value standing out because even the remote regions close to the endpoints @xmath287 have a significant weight almost comparable to that of the central region  especially the dse - rl pion da .",
    "the extreme case of a flat - top da , like @xmath345^{-1 } ( x\\bar{x})^{\\alpha } $ ] with @xmath346 @xcite , translates into a population of oscillators with a very strong variation of native `` frequencies '' so that these oscillators can hardly synchronize and as a result phase locking diminishes .",
    "physically , this kind of @xmath245 distribution comprises extremely asymmetric partonic configurations that can spoil scale locality and thus collinear factorization . on the experimental side , flat - top das yield predictions for the scaled pion - photon transition form factor which have a tendency to increase with @xmath77  at least in the domain of currently accessible momentum values in the range 10 - 40  gev@xmath24 where one would expect scaling to be visible @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath77 data of the babar collaboration @xcite indicate such a trend , but are not supported by the belle data @xcite in the same region .",
    "the next - generation experiments to measure the pion - photon transition form factor with the belle ii detector at the upgraded kekb accelerator ( superkekb ) in japan and more precise data on the electromagnetic pion form factor expected at the jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) after its upgrade will provide extraordinary tools to test our predictions and assertions .",
