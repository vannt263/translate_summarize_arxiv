    "following the standard assumptions , we consider a body centered cubic crystal with only one nuclear cluster per lattice site  @xcite .",
    "we have taken the composition @xmath10 of the clusters calculated by negele and vautherin  @xcite .",
    "but the nucleon distributions have been recalculated at each temperature @xmath11 by solving the finite temperature hartree - fock equations with the skyrme sly4 effective nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite .",
    "typical temperatures of interest for cooling isolated neutron stars and for accreting neutron stars lie in the range between 10@xmath12 to few 10@xmath13  k  @xcite .",
    "fully self - consistent calculations within the band theory are computationally very expensive .",
    "we have thus solved the hartree - fock equations in two steps  @xcite .",
    "first , we have determined self - consistently the nucleon distributions and mean fields in the wigner - seitz approximation with mixed neumann - dirichlet boundary conditions . we have removed the spurious fluctuations of the neutron density by averaging in the interstitial region  @xcite . in a second stage , we have solved the schrdinger equation with bloch boundary conditions using these self - consistent mean fields .",
    "we have fixed the lattice spacing so that the volume of the wigner - seitz polyhedron is equal to the volume of the spherical wigner - seitz cell of radius @xmath14 .",
    "we have employed the linearized augmented plane wave method described in details in ref .  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - body spin - orbit potential has a negligible effect on the neutron level ordering and was therefore neglected .",
    ".for the three shallow layers considered in this paper , are given : the total density ( @xmath15 ) , the number of protons and neutrons ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 respectively ) , the nuclear mass number @xmath18 ( at @xmath19 ) , the radius of the cell ( @xmath20 ) and the neutron gas density at @xmath11=0 ( @xmath21 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     likewise the coefficient @xmath22 ( [ eq.dyneffmass1 ] ) can also be written as an integral over the fermi surface @xmath23 .",
    "( [ eq.dyneffmass1 ] ) then implies that @xmath24 .",
    "inspecting table  [ tab.struc ] shows that the predicted relation between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is only roughly satisfied because @xmath27 varies on the fermi surface .",
    "nevertheless , this analysis in terms of the topology of the fermi surface explains why the presence of the nuclear clusters has such a strong impact on the motion of the unbound neutrons but not on their specific heat .",
    "modelling the recently observed thermal relaxation of neutron star crusts requires the knowledge of their thermal properties . in this paper , we have computed the specific heat of the neutron ocean permeating the inner crust at densities below @xmath28 g.@xmath1 , by applying the band theory of solids with the skyrme sly4 nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we have compared the results obtained using different approximations .",
    "we have found that for temperatures @xmath29k relevant to neutron stars , the neutron specific heat is essentially given by that of a fermi gas .",
    "the thomas - fermi expression  ( [ eq.cv-tf ] ) yields nearly undistinguishable results .",
    "the specific heat calculated in the wigner - seitz approximation agrees reasonably well , while the de gennes approximation  ( [ eq.cv-dg ] ) leads to specific heats a factor of 2 - 3 smaller than those obtained in the band theory .",
    "the results on the specific heat might suggest that the unbound neutrons are not affected by the presence of the nuclear clusters .",
    "it is however not true since the dynamical effective mass of the same unbound neutrons is very different from the bare one unvealing strong interactions with the periodic lattice .",
    "this apparent paradox can be explained by the fact that the neutron fermi surface area and the neutron group velocity are both reduced by the same factor in the presence of clusters , leading to a nearly unchanged density of states and specific heat .",
