    "final section vi is our conclusions .",
    "the following properties of the two posmom operators @xmath11 @xmath30 are easily attainable .",
    "\\i ) since the geometric momentum @xmath31 describes the motion constrained on the surface @xmath6 and there is no motion along the normal direction @xmath24 , which in quantum mechanics is expressed by @xmath32 while it is in classical mechanics expressed by @xmath33 .",
    "this is why two operators @xmath25 and @xmath34 are linearly dependent , as shown in eq .",

    "\\iii ) in the full circle  @xmath43 , we have the solution to the eigenvalue problem @xmath44 , @xmath45which is delta function normalized in any one of four quadrants , say in the first : @xmath46 . for convenience",
    ", we can use @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) to denote the eigenfunctions defined within the @xmath49th quadrants of the circle respectively .",
    "\\iv ) note that @xmath50 is not the simultaneous eigenfunction of operators @xmath51 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the complete simultaneous eigenfunction set of operators @xmath51 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is given by ,    @xmath52    where @xmath4 and @xmath53 indicate even and odd parity respectively about @xmath4-axis , and so on ,    @xmath54    the orthonormality and completeness of the eigenfunction set ( [ parity1])-([parity4 ] ) are satisfied .",

    "this normalization clearly states that for a given @xmath62 , the distribution density @xmath63 usually comes form four parts , @xmath64 it means that for a given @xmath62 , the probability amplitude is from eq .",

    "as is well known , the @xmath1-component angular momentum @xmath69 has a complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath70 ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , ... ) that span a hilbert space for analyzing any state on @xmath6 .",

    "unfortunately , the expansion coefficients ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , provided nontrivial , can not be all greatly simplified unless @xmath96 and @xmath86 being odd . for @xmath71 and @xmath87",
    ", we have following relations ,    @xmath97    where @xmath71 is the only case the probability amplitude of the posmom is double valued . for @xmath86",
    "being odd we have @xmath98 , and for @xmath99 , we have explicitly ,    @xmath100    the probability distributions @xmath101 ( [ p ] ) for rotational states represented by @xmath102 with @xmath71 to @xmath103 are plotted in fig . 1 ( @xmath104 ) , fig . 2 ( @xmath105 ) , fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath106 ) , fig . 4 ( @xmath107 ) , fig . 6 ( @xmath108 ) and fig . 6 ( @xmath109 ) respectively . on the whole , they are similar to the momentum distributions of stationary states for the one - dimensional simple harmonic oscillator .",

    "these distribution densities and the momentum distribution densities for the 0th , 1st and 2nd state of one - dimensional simple harmonic oscillator ( not shown ) , are respectively similar.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure 4     for the 40th excited state @xmath128 , which is symmetrical about @xmath129 but only portion over the postive @xmath62 is depicted .",

    "we can infer that in the limit of large @xmath86 that is even , it is more and more similar to the distribution density for the @xmath137th state of one - dimensional simple harmonic oscillator.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure 5     for the 41th excited state @xmath138 , which is the sum of two identical part @xmath130 and @xmath131 . the distribution density and the momentum distribution density for the @xmath134th excited state of one - dimensional simple harmonic oscillator ( not shown ) ,",
    "are almost the same .",
    "so , we can infer that in the limit of large @xmath86 that is odd , it becomes more and more similar to the distribution density for the @xmath139th state of one - dimensional simple harmonic oscillator.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "the posmom offers a new way to understand the quantum motions , constrained or not .",
    "this study explores the posmom on a circular circle , and identify that the momentum in it is the geometric momentum that is recently proposed to properly describe of the momentum for the motions constrained on the curved surface .  for construction of the complete basis , we need to resort to the mutual commutativity between posmom and parity operators , and then obtain the satisfactory bases each of them is in general four - valued .",
    "the posmometry of the eigenstates of the @xmath1-axis component of the angular momentum is worked out , and is found to be similar to the momentum distributions of stationary states for the one - dimensional simple harmonic oscillators .",
    "then any states on the circle can thus go through the posmometry analysis .",
    "once the posmometer is successfully designed and built up , the ground state of the planar rotation of some molecules , which can be easily prepared , can be visualized via the distribution of density of the posmom ."
