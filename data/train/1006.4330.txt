    "management of the environment and inventory of natural resources often requires appropriate remote sensing data acquired at specific times on earth locations .",
    "but quite often , good resolution optical images have large damaged areas with lost information due to clouds or shadows produced by clouds .    the general statistical approaches for imputation needs to consider the data loss in one of three categories : missing at random data , completely missing at random data , ( meaning that the missing data is independent of its value ) , and non - ignorable missingness , allison(2000 ) .",
    "the last case is the most problematic form , existing when missing values are not randomly distributed across observations , but the probability of missingness can not be predicted from the variables in the model .",
    "one approach to non - ignorable missingness is to impute values based on data otherwise external to the research design , as older images , little et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "merging information acquired at the same time from two or more sensors ( with possible different resolution ) is the core of data fusion techniques .",
    "their historical goals are to increase image resolution , sharpening or enhancement of the output , tsuda et al ( 2003 ) ; ling ( 2007 ) and pohl ( 1998 ) , and their major problem to overcome is the co - registration of the different sources to merge , blum et al ( 2005 ) .    in the last decade several adaptations of data fusion techniques for information recovery have been devised to mitigate the effect of clouds on optical images , a classical problem , since 50% of the sky is usually covered by light clouds . in le hegarat - mascle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) contextual modeling of information was introduced in order to merge data from sar ( synthetic aperture radar ) images into optical images , to correct dark pixels due to clouds .",
    "arellano ( 2003 ) used wavelet transforms first for clouds detection , and then to correct the information of the located clouds pixels by merging older image information with a wavelet multiresolution fusion technique .",
    "rossi et al ( 2003 ) , introduced a spatial technique , krigging interpolation , for correction of shadows due to clouds .",
    "shadows and light clouds do not destroy all information , only distort it , but dark clouds or rain clouds produce non - ignorable missingness , a harder problem for interpolation techniques .",
    "another interesting example of incomplete data is the damaged imagery provided by the landsat 7 etm+ satellite after its failure on may 2003 .",
    "a failure of the scan line corrector , a mirror that compensates for the forward motion of the satellite during data acquisition , resulted on overlaps of some parts of the images acquired thereafter , leaving large gaps , as large as 14 pixels , in others .",
    "about 22% of the total image is missing data in each scene . in figure [ zcent ]",
    "we can see two parts of the same landsat 7 image , one with missing information and another almost without loss .",
    "[ zcent ]    the landsat 7 science team ( 2003 ) , developed and tested composite products made with the damaged landsat 7 image and a database of older landsat images , using local linear histogram matching , a method that merges pieces of older images that best matches the surroundings of the missing information region , scaramuzza et al 2004 , usgs / nasa 2004 , ( united states geological survey/ national aeronautics and space administration ) . commonwealth of australia ( 2006 ) reported that the composite products appear similar in quality to non damaged landsat 7 images , but masked environment changes , an usual problem in data fusion when one of the sources is temporally inaccurate .",
    "zhang and travis ( 2006 ) developed a spatial interpolation method based on krigging , the krigging geostatistical technique , for filling the data gaps in landsat 7 etm+ imagery , without need of extra information .",
    "they compare their method with the standard local linear histogram matching technique chosen by usgs / nasa .",
    "they show in their case study that krigging is better than histogram matching in targets with radical differences in radiance , since it produces an imputation value closer to the values of the actual neighbors .",
    "a drawback of spatial techniques is that they rely on a neighborhood that could be completely empty of real information .",
    "the algorithms start imputation in the gap contour , where there are many good pixels , and use imputed and good values to create the next pixel value . in center pixels of large gaps , algorithms based only on damaged images will use previously imputed values to generate the next imputation , degrading visual quality and increasing interpolation error .    in this paper , we propose three methods based on data fusion techniques for imputation of missing values in images with non - ignorable missingness .",
    "we suppose there is available temporally accurate extra information for the gap scenes , produced by a lower resolution sensor .",
    "this is not a very restrictive hypothesis , since there are many satellite constellations that can provide temporally accurate data with different cameras at different resolutions .",
    "this study proposes three different alternatives for filling the data gaps .",
    "the first method involve merging information from a co - registered older image and a lower resolution image acquired at the same time , in the fourier domain ( method a ) .",
    "the second used a linear regression model with the lower resolution image as extra data ( method b ) . the third method consider segmentation as the main target of processing , and",
    "propose a method to fill the gaps in the map of classes , avoiding direct imputation for the segmentation task ( method c ) .",
    "radiometric imputation is later made assigning a random value from the convex hull made by the neighbor pixels within its class .",
    "all the methods were compared by means of a large simulation study , evaluating performance with a multivariate response vector with four measures : q , rmse , kappa and overall accuracy coefficients .",
    "two of these performance measures ( kappa and overall accuracy ) are designed for the assessment of segmentation accuracy .",
    "the other two , q and rmse , measure radiometric interpolation accuracy .",
    "difference in performance were tested with a manova mixed model design with two main effects , imputation method and type of lower resolution extra data , and a blocking third factor with a nested sub - factor , introduced by the real landsat image and the sub - images that were used .",
    "method b proved to be the best for all criteria .",
    "we are considering images acquired from the same geographic target , with fixed number of bands @xmath0 , and 256 levels of gray per band . damaged and older images have the same support , lower resolution images have different supports , and we suppose that there are @xmath1 pixels in the damaged image for each pixel in the lower resolution image .",
    "let @xmath2 be the damaged image , @xmath3 a lower spatial resolution image , and @xmath4 , an older image acquired with the same sensor that @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the gap to be filled , i.e. the set of pixels of @xmath2 with missing values .",
    "the goal is to input values on @xmath5 using available good data from @xmath2 in a small neighborhood of each pixel , the values of @xmath3 and eventually , the values of @xmath4 .",
    "the first step in processing is the re - sampling of the lower resolution image in order to match the support of the three images .",
    "this is done replacing each pixel @xmath6 of @xmath3 by a matrix of size @xmath7 with constant value @xmath8 .",
    "imputation is done in each band separately with the same algorithm , thus the methods descriptions consider the images as one band only .",
    "the image @xmath4 does not need to be co - registered with reference to the damaged image @xmath2 , since they have been acquired by the same sensor , but calibration is indeed necessary to increase merging accuracy .",
    "we suppose a gaussian calibration have been made on @xmath4 per column , taking as pivots the values in the matched column of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the composite image , output from the imputation method a. we define @xmath9 values in the gap as a mixture of high frequencies of the older image and low frequencies taken from the actual but lower resolution image .",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the ideal high pass and low pass fourier filters .",
    "the filters are regulated by the @xmath13 coefficient , the bigger @xmath13 is the larger the influence of @xmath3 in the imputation .",
    "high pass filters are related to detail , edges and random noise , and low pass filters to structural information .",
    "therefore , method a takes structural information from the low resolution image and detail from the older one .",
    "imputation will be made with the only help of @xmath3 , a temporally accurate image with lower resolution .",
    "we have expanded the lower resolution image to match the support of @xmath2 , replacing each cross grained pixel by a block of @xmath7 pixels with the same radiometric value .",
    "each one of the constant blocks of the expanded @xmath3 image has a matched block in the damaged image @xmath2 , that could be valid ( having all the information ) , or non valid , ( with some loss ) .",
    "we will follow a time series approach now .",
    "let think we have data collected month to month along several years , and we have a missing january data .",
    "it is reasonably to impute that value using a regression model that only involves other january data , and extra data collected on summer that year .    in our case",
    ", we have missing information on a location @xmath6 inside a block @xmath14 , we may impute that value using a regression model that only involves data in the same position inside the other blocks of the image ( january data ) , using as regressor variable the values of @xmath3 ( summer data ) .",
    "@xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 are estimated by ordinary least squares using only valid blocks",
    ". then @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22    we define the imputed image @xmath23 as @xmath2 in the pixels with no missing information and the value predicted by the regression in each damaged pixel .",
    "@xmath24      remote sense images are used in a wide range of applied sciences . for many of them , as agricultural and experimental biology , or environmental science , all useful information is contained on a class map , where the classes are characterized by special features under study .",
    "kind of crop , forested or deforested areas , regions with high , medium and low soil humidity , are examples of such features .    in this section we will change our point of view by thinking on class maps instead on radiometric images",
    "let suppose we have our damaged image @xmath2 , and a temporally accurate image @xmath3 with lower resolution , and possible different number of radiometric bands .",
    "this is an advantage over radiometric imputation , which need the same spectral properties in both images .",
    "we also suppose that a map of classes @xmath25 has been drawn from the damaged image @xmath2 , using a non supervised method like @xmath0 means , with @xmath0 different classes .",
    "the class of missing information pixels is another class , called class 0 .",
    "the goal is to assign the pixels without radiometric information to one of the @xmath0 classes , and generate a radiometric value for them randomly from the selected class .",
    "there are two main steps in this method    1 .",
    "an enhancement of the initial classification @xmath25 , that could be made or not 2 .",
    "imputation of pixels in the zero class .",
    "[ [ initial - enhancement ] ] initial enhancement + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    automatic classification is a difficult task , and the imputation method under study heavily depends of the accuracy of the initial map of classes .",
    "so it is important to pay special attention to the coherence of the classes .",
    "we suggest a set of steps to improve class homogeneity as follows    1 .",
    "given @xmath2 construct a map of classes @xmath25 using @xmath0 means , and assign the zero label to the missing information regions .",
    "2 .   given the class image @xmath25 , detect the pixels with non homogeneous neighborhood , i.e , pixels that have no neighbor pixels on the same class .",
    "call this set @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   for each pixel in @xmath26 , verify its label using a forward mode filter , and a backwards mode filter .",
    "the filters with give a label that is consistent with the mode of the labels in a ( forward or backward ) neighborhood .",
    "1 .   if both filters give the same label , update the label of the pixel to match this one .",
    "if the labels are not the same , maintain the original label , and put the pixel in a new set call @xmath27 .",
    "4 .   for each pixel in @xmath27 that do not has label zero , we use again radiometric information for updating the label .",
    "1 .   take the one step neighbors of the pixels , and compute the arithmetic mean for each class present in the neighborhood .",
    "2 .   update the label of the pixel by the label of the class whose arithmetic mean is closest ( in euclidean distance ) to the radiometric value of the pixel .",
    "it is important to note that after this process , some of the pixels of the zero class may have been classified into a real class , only using contextual information .",
    "the other classes should have more defined borderlines .    [",
    "[ class - zero - imputation ] ] class zero imputation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we suppose now that we have a stable map of @xmath0 classes @xmath25 , with missing information in class zero , and auxiliary information provided by a temporally accurate lower resolution radiometric image @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a pixel in class zero , it does not have radiometric information .",
    "we will impute a label class on it with the following algorithm    1 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the smallest neighborhood of @xmath6 that have a pixel with non zero label .",
    "2 .   let @xmath29 be the arithmetic mean of the @xmath3 pixels that have positions in class @xmath30 in @xmath28 .",
    "the label of @xmath6 is the label of the class @xmath30 that makes the smallest euclidean distance from @xmath8 to each @xmath29 . @xmath31    after this process , all pixels have a class label , but pixels in the gaps have not been imputed with radiometric information yet .",
    "a pixel s radiometric value is assigned randomly from the values of the convex hull generated by the pixels of a small neighborhood within its class .",
    "impartial imputation assessment is only possible when ground truth is available .",
    "complete simulation of the three types of images involved in the methods ( old , damaged and lower resolution ) will introduce errors beyond the ones produced by the imputation methods , degrading the quality of the assessment .",
    "for this reason , good quality landsat 7 etm+ imagery that have older matched imagery available were selected , and strips similar to the gaps in the slc - off etm+ imagery were cut manually , guaranteeing ground truth to compare with and co - registration between the images .",
    "the four landsat 7 etm+ images selected were quit large , having many different textures in them , like crop fields , mountains and cities , that challenge the imputation methods differently .",
    "landsat 7 etm+ had a lower resolution sensor in its constellation , the mmrs camera from the sac c satellite , whose imagery could be used as extra data . but to control also co - registration problems , lower resolution imagery were simulated with three resolution reduction methods ( rrm ) , by block averaging the ground truth , the congrid method from envi software and shifted block averaging .",
    "block averaging is a crude way of reducing resolution , the congrid method reduces the blocking effect smoothing the output , giving better visual appearance , but block averaging allows to shift the blocks in a controlled fashion , simulating lack of co - registration .    in figure [ examples ] we see an example of four matched images , good , damaged , older and lower resolution by block averaging .",
    "we can see a bright spot in the center of the image , which is still present in the damaged one and the lower resolution one , but it is not present in the older one .",
    "database construction details are giving in the subsection [ database ] .",
    "the performance measures ( rmse , q , kappa and overall accuracy ) were modeled as a response vector in a manova mixed model with main effects ( imputation method , resolution reduction method ) , and random nested effects ( image and sub - image ) . subsection [ measures ] introduces the performance measures and subsection [ anova ] includes a detailed description of the manova design . following the manova rejection ,",
    "simultaneous multivariate comparisons were made by ( bonferroni corrected ) two means hotelling tests , and individual anova results with simultaneous comparisons via fisher lsd tests were studied to determine the best method , and the influence in performance of co - registration problems .",
    "we selected four landsat 7 etm+ images with six bands each , acquired before the failure of the slc mirror .",
