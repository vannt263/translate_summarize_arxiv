    "wormholes are solutions of the equations of gravitation which imply a nontrivial topology of spacetime , connecting two regions of the universe or of two different universes by a traversable throat . for compact configurations ,",
    "the throat is a minimal area surface @xcite ; this feature is determined by the fact that the geodesics open up at the throat ( for an alternative definition in terms of trapped surfaces see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "following the leading work by morris and thorne @xcite in which their main aspects were introduced , traversable lorentzian wormholes have received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "if traversable wormholes exist , they could imply some unusual consequences , as for example the possibility of time travel @xcite .",
    "however , difficulties with their mechanical stability and the requirement of exotic matter ( matter not fulfilling the energy conditions ) , which seems unavoidable within the framework of general relativity , constitute the main objections against the actual existence of these objects . in particular ,",
    "these two central aspects have been thoroughly analyzed for wormholes of the thin - shell class @xcite , that is , geometries which are mathematically constructed by cutting and pasting two manifolds , so that a matter layer is located at the throat ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "about two decades ago , the geometrical aspects of topological defects like cosmic strings began to be the object of a detailed study , mainly because they could have played an important role in structure formation in the early universe ; it was also pointed out that they could manifest by gravitational lensing effects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from a different point of view , one - dimensional ( open or closed ) strings are the objects more seriously considered by present theoretical developments to be the fundamental building blocks of nature . as a consequence ,",
    "the interest in the gravitational effects of both fundamental and cosmic strings has been recently renewed ( for example , see refs .",
    "it is thus natural that cylindrically symmetric wormhole geometries , as those associated to cosmic strings are , have been considered in the last years .",
    "recent works in which cylindrical wormholes have been studied include those by clment @xcite , aros and zamorano @xcite , kuhfittig @xcite , bronnikov and lemos @xcite and our papers @xcite .",
    "the thin - shell wormhole configurations associated to local and global cosmic strings analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite turned to be unstable under velocity perturbations conserving the cylindrical symmetry .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out @xcite that this feature seemed to be independent of the particular geometry considered , as long as the symmetry and the form of the equations of state of the static configurations were preserved .",
    "mechanical instability would constitute an additional restriction to the possibility of finding these objects in the present day universe , besides the usual problem with exotic matter .",
    "however , regarding the issue of exotic matter , there is a subtle point in the case of non compact wormholes as cylindrically symmetric ones are. it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that for such configurations there are two admissible definitions of the throat , and that one of them that the geodesics _ restricted to a plane normal to the symmetry axis _",
    "open up can be compatible with a positive energy density",
    ".    in this work we extend our previous analysis of non - rotating cylindrical thin - shell wormholes .",
    "we first construct them by cut and paste of two equal regions of the most general static cylindrically symmetric geometry .",
    "then we consider small velocity perturbations , under the hypothesis that the form of the equations of state of matter on the shell are preserved in the subsequent evolution .",
    "our results demonstrate the conjecture about the stability of these objects introduced in ref .",
    "second , we discuss the implications of relaxing the flare - out condition , as proposed in @xcite . we find that within this new approach , for certain values of the parameters characterizing the configurations , cylindrical thin - shell wormholes could be supported by matter of positive energy density .",
    "the analysis is exemplified with wormholes constructed starting from einstein ",
    "maxwell cylindrical geometries . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt units such @xmath0 .",
    "in coordinates @xmath1 , the general static metric with cylindrical symmetry can be written in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive functions of @xmath7 . from this geometry , we take two copies @xmath8 of the region with @xmath9 and join them at the hypersurface @xmath10 to make a manifold @xmath11 , which is geodesically complete . if the geometry opens up at the shell ( flare - out condition ) , this construction creates a cylindrically symmetric thin - shell wormhole with two regions connected by a throat at @xmath12 . for the analysis of this traversable wormhole , we use the standard darmois - israel formalism @xcite ( for a modern review see ref .",

    "the throat of the wormhole is a synchronous timelike hypersurface , in which we adopt coordinates @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the proper time on the shell .",

    "( [ e12 ] ) it follows that the surface energy density is negative , indicating the presence of _ exotic _ matter at the throat . the usual definition of the wormhole throat suitable for compact configurations states that it is a _ minimal area surface_. in the cylindrical case one can define the area function @xmath55 , which should increase at both sides of the throat ;",
    "then @xmath56 , so that @xmath57 .",
    "we shall call it the _ areal _ flare - out condition , for which negative energy density at the throat is clearly unavoidable .",
    "however , bronnikov and lemos @xcite recently pointed out that , for infinite cylindrical configurations , a less restrictive definition of the wormhole throat seems to be the most natural .",
    "this new definition requires that the circular radius function @xmath58 has a minimum at the throat , so this function should increase at both sides of it ( the geodesics within a plane normal to the symmetry axis open up at the throat ) ; thus we shall call this one the _ radial _ flare - out condition .",
    "this definition implies @xmath59 , leaving free the sign of @xmath60 ; this feature is of central relevance for the physical viability of the wormhole , because allows for the possibility of a _ positive _ energy density .",
    "in what follows , we assume that the equations of state for the dynamic case have the same form as in the static one , i.e. that they do not depend on the derivatives of @xmath61 , so @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given by eqs .",

    "( [ e18 ] ) one concludes that the sign of the velocity of the shell after being perturbed is completely determined by the sign of the initial velocity .",

    "no oscillatory behavior can take place : the shell can only undergo a monotonous evolution . because we have started from the most general static cylindrically symmetric geometry , we then find that the conjecture introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is true : under the assumption that the symmetry is preserved and that the equations of state of matter on the shell corresponding to static configurations are kept valid after a perturbation , cylindrical thin - shell wormholes are unstable .",
    "there exist three kinds of static cylindrically symmetric geometries associated to maxwell electromagnetism coupled to einstein gravity @xcite : with the definition @xmath68 , we have the metric associated to an axial current ( angular magnetic field ) ds^2=r^2m^2g^2(r)-dt^2+dr^2+r^2g^2(r)d^2+g^-2(r)dz^2 , the metric corresponding to an angular current ( magnetic field in the direction of the symmetry axis ) ds^2=r^2m^2g^2(r)-dt^2+dr^2+g^-2(r)d^2+r^2g^2(r)dz^2 , and the metric associated to an axial charge ( radial electric field ) : ds^2=-g^-2(r)dt^2+r^2m^2g^2(r)dr^2+dz^2+r^2g^2(r)d^2.[e ] the constants @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are real numbers that must fulfill @xmath72 in the magnetic cases and @xmath73 in the electric case , so the metric and the electromagnetic potential are real @xcite .",
    "the coordinates adopted above have been suitably adimensionalized in order to avoid constants which do not play an important physical role .     with a radial electric field : the gray zones correspond to the values of the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for which the radial flare - out condition is satisfied.,width=566 ]     with a radial electric field :",

    "thus in both magnetic cases we obtain the same behaviour for the product @xmath81 , whose radial derivative , after the mathematical construction of a wormhole of throat radius @xmath82 , determines the sign of the surface energy density @xmath37 : @xmath83 , so that @xmath84 and @xmath37 can only be negative . in the case with a radial electric field , instead , we have @xmath85 , which not necessarily is an increasing function of @xmath7 . thus we can have @xmath86 and , if this is compatible with @xmath87 , working with the radial flare - out condition a cylindrical thin - shell wormhole would be possible with @xmath88 .",

    "then it is not possible to satisfy the energy conditions , though the energy density can be positive . if the parameters are such that @xmath88 , then an observer at rest at the throat , or an observer moving radially from one side of the throat to the other side would find only positive energy matter . which results from @xmath93 .",
    "we have constructed cylindrical thin shell wormholes of a general class , symmetric with respect to the throat . under the assumption that the equations of state on the shell which defines the throat have the same form as in the static case",
    "when it is perturbed preserving the symmetry , we have shown that these wormholes are always mechanically unstable .",
    "we have therefore demonstrated our conjecture presented in @xcite : this is a general property and does not depend on the particular form of the metric adopted for the construction .",
    "two possible definitions of the flare - out condition were considered .",
    "the areal flare - out condition is more restrictive because it always leads to a negative energy density on the throat . instead ,",
    "in this work we have shown that the radial one is less restrictive , allowing for positive energy density , depending on the particular form of the original metric from which the construction was performed .",
    "examples of wormholes with electromagnetic fields were presented . in the two cases with a magnetic field ,",
