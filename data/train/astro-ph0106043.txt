    "the existence of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) was highlighted by the infrared astronomical satellite ( ) .",
    "the class is arbitrarily defined by sanders and mirabel as galaxies having l@xmath0 l@xmath1 , where l@xmath2 l(8  1000 @xmath3 m ) using h@xmath4 = 75 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath4 = 0 .",
    "note that , unless otherwise specified , we have adopted h@xmath4 = 50 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath4 = 0 throughout . in order to produce energy output of this magnitude , ulirgs require a substantial energy source .",
    "the two main candidates are a burst of strong star formation in a central starburst or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) with accretion onto a central black hole .",
    "ulirgs are generally very gas and dust rich e.g. rigopoulou et al .. unfortunately this gas and dust obscures the centre of the galaxies in which they reside , hampering identification of the central source .",
    "direct evidence for the presence of agn is found for some ulirgs in the form of seyfert - like emission line ratios , high excitation lines and sometimes broad permitted - line widths @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the fraction of ulirgs containing agn rises with infrared luminosity ( e.g. sanders et al . ) .",
    "often evidence for the presence of strong star formation is found ( e.g. genzel et al . ) .",
    "however in many cases the identity of the central source is still uncertain .",
    "a large number of ulirgs have now been identified .",
    "many have been well studied via optical imaging @xcite and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "however , data of longer wavelengths , such as the near infrared ( nir ) , have the potential to probe deeper into the dust which enshrouds these galaxies , since the extinction is much less i.e. a@xmath6 10 a@xmath7 .",
    "relative to the optical , less nir data exists for ulirgs .",
    "goldader et al .",
    "have obtained k band spectra for a sample of 13 ulirgs and 24 luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) .",
    "comparison of the properties of the two sets of galaxies highlights a suppression in the dereddened luminosity of the br@xmath8 emission , relative to the far - infrared luminosity for the ulirgs , as compared to the lirgs .",
    "murphy et al . have studied a sample consisting of 46 galaxies from the  2 jy survey .",
    "they have imaged these galaxies in the optical and the nir , and find a high percentage to be interacting ( 95 per cent ) .",
    "they have also obtained nir spectral data for 33 of these objects for which results has recently been published @xcite . finally , veilleux et al .",
    "have conducted a campaign aimed at uncovering hidden broad line regions in ulirgs .",
    "they have observed in total 64 ulirgs , taken from the 1 jy sample @xcite .",
    "broad pa@xmath9 is detected for the first time in four sources and possibly more , some uncertainty is due to the potential contamination from the presence of a nearby h@xmath10 line .",
    "we have selected a subset of galaxies mainly from the sample of leech et al . .",
    "these display a cross - section of interaction characteristics i.e. ranging from some that are obviously interacting to those with no companion within a significant distance .",
    "two other ulirgs were added which show evidence of interaction in their morphology .",
    "our final sample shows a bias towards interacting galaxies .",
    "h and k band spectra have been obtained for this sample . using this data we have investigated the central sources of the ulirgs , looking for possible broadened emission lines and/or high excitation lines indicative of the presence of an agn .",
    "we also study the excitation mechanisms of the lines present .",
    "this will allow us to determine which processes are dominant in particular objects , for example excitation due to young stars , supernova remnants ( snr ) , a central black hole or shocks due to interaction .",
    "additionally we investigate further relationships which have been established previously , such as the under - luminous br@xmath8 line issue mentioned previously .",
    "in addition we have j , h and k band imaging for our sample which is discussed separately in davies et al . .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , the sample is discussed in   [ sample ] .",
    "the spectral data are then presented and the observations and data reduction are discussed in   [ observations ] .",
    "the final results are presented and discussed in   [ results ] .",
    "the summary of our results appears in   [ summary ] , and a brief synopsis for each galaxy is included in appendix  [ app ] .",
    "the galaxies in our sample were selected based on their extreme infrared luminosities ( @xmath11 , using h@xmath4 = 50 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath4 = 0 ) .",
    "we note that when using the sanders and mirabel definition of this classification , which uses the higher value of h@xmath4 , two of our sample , iras20210 and iras23420 , have values for @xmath12 falling slightly below @xmath13 l@xmath14 .",

    "absorption features from the underlying stellar continuum may have affected emission lines for some objects .",
    "observing effects such as wavelength dependent slit losses , seeing , guiding effects and centring errors may affect the nir line fluxes , especially important here since most of the objects are extended .",
    "values for h@xmath9 and h@xmath15 fluxes come from observations using a wider slit than used here i.e. veilleux et al . used a 2.0 arcsec slit ,",
    "our observations were made with a 1.22 arcsec slit width .",
    "this could lead to underestimates of nir line fluxes and hence a@xmath28 , in cases where the emission line region is extended over many arcsecs .",
    "finally , differences in the dust coverage could affect these values , potential clumpy dust coverage may result in nir lines coming from a region not seen in the optical .",

    "this could be faint broad emission from high velocity gas ( fwhm @xmath26 2500 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "however in most cases , with the possible exception of iras17179 and iras20210 , other explanations are possible .",
    "one possibility is faint h@xmath10 emission from the 75o(3)1.8721@xmath3 m and 64o(5 ) 1.8665@xmath3 m transitions @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the presence of a pair of hei emission lines at 1.8686@xmath3 m and 1.8697@xmath3 m @xcite . at the spectral resolution of our data we can not distinguish between the possibilities .",
    "the only broad emission observed is pa@xmath15 with fwhm @xmath26  5000 km s@xmath5 , seen in the spectrum of iras23498 .",
    "previous observations of this seyfert 2 consistently show broadened emission ( fwhm @xmath26  3000 km s@xmath5 ) in the pa@xmath9 line @xcite .",
    "a significant correlation between l@xmath36 and l@xmath37 has been found for lirgs , the less luminous counterparts of ulirgs .",
    "ulirgs however , do not follow the same relationship and appear to be underluminous in br@xmath8 emission @xcite .",
    "we have added the data for our sample to the previously published data to see if they fall upon the same relationship .    for consistency",
    "we have calculated l@xmath37 ( @xmath38 l(40120@xmath3 m ) ) using the formula from helou et al . .",
    "note that , following goldader et al .",
    ", we have taken h@xmath4 = 75 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 for this calculation . where available , we have used _",
    "e(b  v ) _ from the literature , calculated using optical line ratios ( see table  [ extinc ] for more details ) . where _",
    "e(b  v ) _ was not available the data were not corrected for extinction .",
    "figure  [ gold ] shows l@xmath36 vs l@xmath37 for both datasets , where the solid line is the best fit to the lirgs made by goldader et al .. they conclude that the ulirgs from their sample fall below the correlation indicating that they are underluminous in br@xmath8 .",
    "the two lower luminosity galaxies from our sample , classified in this work as ulirgs , would actually be classified in the goldader scheme as lirgs , due to the different value of h@xmath4 used .",
    "our higher luminosity objects do not seem to follow the trend of underluminosity in br@xmath8 emission with respect to the correlation marked .",
    "in fact , our data points may follow the correlation if the large scatter seen for the lirgs is taken into consideration .",
    "the importance of aperture effects must also be considered . on average , the objects from the goldader sample",
    "have been observed with a 3.0 arcsec wide aperture .",
    "the slit width used in our observations was 1.22 arcsec .",
    "this may result in our observations giving a lower line flux , and hence luminosity , by a factor of approximately 2 , with respect to those of goldader et al ..    the depression of the br@xmath8 luminosity in ulirgs , when compared with lirgs , is explained by goldader and colleagues by a simple model where ulirgs contain very compact nuclei which are optically thick at 2@xmath3 m .",
    "they reason that the br@xmath8 is therefore highly obscured , resulting in a poor correlation between br@xmath8 and fir luminosity",
    ".    an alternative explanation would be to question the correlation found for lirgs .",
    "when considered as a group , the relationship found can be seen to be very dependent on the two highest luminosity points .",
    "if these are disregarded , then the scatter of the remaining points would change the fitting of any trend dramatically .",
    "when the additional higher luminosity data points provided by the ulirgs are added to the plot then a correlation with a lower gradient could be fitted to both sets of data . indeed , there is such a large scatter in the data that it is possible that there is no correlation and instead simply two regions , representing the range of properties found for each group .",
    "they find support for their conclusions in other work involving lirgs , where similar relationships have been found @xcite .",
    "the distinction between lirgs and ulirgs is arbitrary , and claims that they are fundamentally different would need to be supported by observations at other wavelengths .",
    "four of the galaxies observed have multiple nuclei . of these ,",
    "two were observed with the slit orientation covering both nuclei .",
    "this was the case for iras00150 and iras20210 .",
    "the spectra of the second nuclei are plotted with the primary nuclei , at the same scaling , in figure  [ spectra ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the spectra of the secondary nuclei seen are practically featureless .",
    "this is consistent with preliminary findings from another recent nir survey of 33 ulirgs ( including iras16487 and iras23365 ) conducted by murphy et al . .",
    "the only feature we see for the secondary nucleus of iras00150 is weak pa@xmath9 emission .",
    "the second nucleus of iras20210 shows no emission lines , but does show co absorption , indicative of an old stellar population .",
    "it is useful to make an estimate of the contribution of the secondary nucleus to the overall fir luminosity of the system as detected by . for iras00150 , assuming the relationship between l@xmath36 and l@xmath37 holds (   [ corr ] ) and using the ratio of pa@xmath9 in the two nuclei , we estimate the minor nucleus contributes 20 per cent of the fir emission . for iras20210 we used the ratio of br@xmath8 emission .",
    "an upper limit of f@xmath36 = 3.81 @xmath39 was found in the secondary nucleus , indicating a contribution of @xmath26 6 per cent .",
    "therefore , in both cases , the contribution of the secondary nucleus is minor .",
    "we note the the similarity of the spectra of the two nuclei seen for iras00150 , here the minor component could be a scaled version of the major .",
    "this is not the case for iras20210 , where the line to continuum ratio seen in the major component is not mirrored in the second nucleus .",
    "emission from electric quadrupole transitions within the ground state of molecular hydrogen is often bright in infrared observations of starburst galaxies and agn .",
    "there are two types of excitation mechanisms producing these lines : collisions due to shocks ( thermal process ) and radiative decay from an excited state produced by uv photons or x - rays , resulting in fluorescence ( non - thermal process ) . in general both mechanisms",
    ", in varying proportions , contribute to the emission .",
    "two galactic cases of particular interest are ( 1 ) supernova remnants ( snr ) which exhibit purely thermal shock excited emission , and ( 2 ) planetary nebulae which exhibit pure fluorescent emission . in starburst galaxies",
    "ob stars produce uv photons , also snr and winds from massive stars drive large scale outflows which produce shocks ( e.g. heckman et al . .",
    "often the more dominant mechanism is uncertain . in agn , the stronger h@xmath10 emitters ,",
    "the emission is believed to be associated with the active nucleus which emits a strong uv  x - ray continuum and also drives outflows .",
    "enhanced h@xmath10 emission in mergers may arise from shocks produced by cloud - cloud collisions , as originally proposed by harwit et al . .",
    "however the small filling factor of the dense molecular clouds presents problems for this model .",
    "a solution to this problem may be that proposed by jog & solomon , who describe a scenario in which hi clouds , associated with the interacting galaxies and with large filling factors , collide .",
    "this leads to the formation of hot , ionised , high pressure gas which causes a radiative shock compression of the denser h@xmath10 clouds .",
    "since the non - thermal mechanism is more efficient than the thermal in the population of @xmath40 = 2 and higher vibrational levels , in principle line ratios can be used to discriminate between these mechanisms .",
    "a minimum of two h@xmath10 lines were detected for each galaxy , increasing to nine for the brightest galaxy observed , iras20210 .",
    "the potential for deconvolution of this emission into thermal and non - thermally excited components is small for the galaxies which show only a few h@xmath10 lines and so only generalised conclusions can be drawn .",
    "for the brighter galaxies : iras20210 , iras23365 and iras23420 we use the population and diagnostic diagrams discussed later in this section .",
    "first we draw some general conclusions concerning thermal vs non - thermal excitation for each galaxy by the direct comparison of observed line ratios with those from models .",
    "table  [ ratios ] lists the measured ratios compared with typical shock and low density fluorescent predictions taken from black and van dishoeck , plus a mixed model assuming equal contributions to 10s(1 ) flux from shock and uv components .",
    "iras00150 , iras16487 and iras17179 have only two h@xmath10 line detections .",
    "this limits our analysis substantially , but we can conclude that the ratio is indicative of a shock origin over fluorescence .",
    "we note that in iras00150 and iras17179 the ratio is @xmath2610 per cent less than that expected for shock excitation .",
    "however this may be attributed to errors in the marginal detection of the lines above the noise in the spectra .",
    "line ratios for iras20210 strongly indicate a purely shock origin for the emission with good agreement for all but one of the ratios considered .",
    "the one discrepancy is the 2 - 1s(1 ) line which was only detected above the 2@xmath18 level .",
    "the ratios measured for iras23365 are fitted best by the predictions produced by the mixed model .",
    "this predicts similar fluxes for 10s(0 ) and 21s(1 ) , indicating approximately equal contributions from shock and fluorescent excitation processes .",
    "finally , considering the ratios seen for iras23420 the best model is unclear .",
    "the 10s(2 ) line ratio falls between predicted values for both the shock and mixed models . the low ratio value seen for 10s(0 ) however , the stronger of the two lines , favours the shock model over the mixed model .",

    "the population of these levels is dominated by thermal excitation which falls off rapidly in other bands . hence to deconvolve this emission successfully , detection of lines from the @xmath40=2 levels",
    "is necessary .",
    "this becomes evident when comparing the predicted ratios in table  [ ratios ] .",
    "the best lines to use are those having very different ratios for shock and uv models .",

    "level population diagrams are a useful tool , employing similar theory to the previous method , but utilising more emission lines .",
    "we also employ diagnostic diagrams with h@xmath10 line ratios , used by mouri to study different thermal excitation mechanisms using characteristic temperatures .",

    "it is immediately obvious that none of the galaxies exhibits purely thermal emission .",
    "the data for iras20210 , with 9 derived points , indicates a _ mostly _ thermal origin with a small fraction of fluorescence also present .",
    "analysis indicates 10 per cent of the 1 - 0s(0 ) flux , 40 per cent of the total h@xmath10 flux , comes from non - thermal emission , with a temperature of 1870k .",
    "this model fits well for @xmath40=1 lines but fits less well for the @xmath40=2 lines . additionally ,",
    "when placed on the diagnostic diagrams of mouri , iras20210 is in the region occupied by the shock model and supernova remnants  objects known to show purely thermal emission .",
    "the population diagram for iras23365 is quite different , a single straight line fit is very unlikely .",
    "the lines seen for @xmath40 = 1 , j = 6 and 7 and @xmath40 = 2 , j = 3 are weak detections and in one case ( j=7 ) only an upper limit , which was not included in the fit .",
    "we find for this object a higher proportion of non - thermal contribution , 30 per cent of the 10s(1 ) flux , 70 per cent of the total h@xmath10 flux , with a temperature of 2800k .",
    "this model fits well except for the 10s(4 ) line which falls at a wavelength which shows a drop in transmission for this object .",
    "when plotted on the diagnostic diagrams of mouri , this galaxy falls in the region occupied by ngc6240 .",
    "ngc6240 is a galaxy - merger starburst / liner system with much disputed emission mechanisms .",
    "values for the amount of non - thermal h@xmath10 emission exhibited by this object range from none @xcite to 70 per cent @xcite .",
    "mouri favours shock heating for the thermal component of this galaxy . based on the similar position of these galaxies in the diagnostic diagrams we suggest that a similar interpretation might apply to iras23365 .",
    "finally we consider the population diagram for iras23420 .",
    "unfortunately we detect only lines from the @xmath40 = 1 level for this galaxy which makes the interpretation inconclusive .",
    "some of these detections are also only weak , leading to uncertainties .",
    "our model finds 30 per cent of the 10s(1 ) flux , 70 per cent of the total h@xmath10 flux , having a non - thermal origin , with a temperature of 2450k , agreeing with the conclusions drawn previously using the line ratios .",
    "mouri et al .",
    "find a linear correlation between the h@xmath10 @xmath40=10s(1)/br@xmath8 and [ oi]@xmath486300/h@xmath9 emission line ratios for a sample of galaxies containing an agn or a starburst nucleus .",
    "their data show both the h@xmath101 - 0s(1 ) ( hereafter s(1 ) ) and [ oi ] lines are enhanced in agn . using optical data , where available , from the literature we have added the galaxies we have observed to those in the mouri sample ,",
    "see figure  [ o1_plot ] .",
    "squares represent starburst nuclei , circles represent agn and triangles represent liners .",
    "the circled points are the four galaxies from our sample : iras16487 , iras17179 , iras20210 and iras23365 .",
    "classifications for these galaxies , taken from the literature , are liner , sy2 , sy2 and liner respectively .",
    "the positions of these galaxies on this plot are as expected ; they lie amongst the agn with enhanced s(1 ) and [ oi ] emission .",
    "mouri et al .",
    "have only one liner included in their sample , ngc6240 ( mentioned earlier ) , which they note has a remarkable s(1 ) line width with fwhm @xmath26 650 km s@xmath5 .",
    "when ngc6240 is plotted it falls at the extreme upper right , away from the other galaxies .",
    "the authors interpreted this as a special case in which the emission is excited by shocks directly , due to the merger of two galaxies , in addition to the effects of a central engine and/or starburst activities .",
    "this theory has been supported by recent work on ngc6240 by ohyama et al .",
    ", who have found evidence for young superbubbles in the central region .",
    "they propose that the interaction of this expanding shell with the extragalactic molecular gas produces shock - excited intense h@xmath10 emission .",
    "the liner galaxies we have added however , iras16487 and iras23365 , show smaller s(1 ) line widths ( respectively fwhm @xmath26 400 km s@xmath5 and @xmath26 250 km s@xmath5 ) , consistent with their position amongst the agn .",
    "the most prominent [ feii ] transition lines seen in the nir are a@xmath49d@xmath50 ",
    "a@xmath51d@xmath52 at 1.257@xmath3 m and a@xmath51f@xmath50  a@xmath51d@xmath52 at 1.644@xmath3 m . due to the range of redshifts of the objects observed , the former line was not covered by our data .",
    "the wavelength of the line at 1.644@xmath3 m meant that it could potentially be observed in every galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , due the range of redshifts observed , this line falls in the region where atmospheric absorption is high for some objects .",
    "this is the case for iras00150 , iras17179 and iras23420 . despite this the [ feii]1.644@xmath3 m line",
    "is detected in all the galaxies observed except iras00150 , where a slight increase in flux can be seen at the appropriate wavelength .",
    "another , lower flux , [ feii ] emission line at 1.9670@xmath3 m falls in the waveband observed .",
    "this line may be detected in iras17179 and iras20210 .",
    "an increase in flux at the appropriate wavelength can be seen for iras23365 and iras23420 , however there is no detection above the 2 @xmath18 limit . at this resolution",
    ", this line would be blended with [ sivi ] emission .",
    "such an apparently low incidence of the [ feii ] 1.9670@xmath3 m line in this sample is perhaps slightly surprising when compared with a recent survey of ulirgs where detections of this line are claimed for 81 per cent of objects observed @xcite .",
    "however the typical [ feii]/pa@xmath9 ratio quoted is around 1 per cent for objects with weaker [ feii ] emission , rendering the line too faint to be seen for the objects we observe .",
    "we note murphy et al",
    ". do not detect [ feii ] 1.9670@xmath3 m for iras16487 or iras23365 .",
    "the excitation mechanism of [ feii ] emission is still under debate . like",
    "[ oi ] , [ feii ] emission is excited by electron collisions in partially ionised regions ( pirs ) .",
    "mouri et al .",
    "attribute extensive pirs in starburst galaxies to shock heating from supernovae , whereas in seyfert galaxies they propose these regions arise due to photoionisation by nuclear radiation .",
    "alonso - herrero et al .",
    "demonstrate a similar idea , favouring a progression of the proportion of shock excitation present from hii regions to starburst galaxies , through to seyferts and supernovae .",
    "this is demonstrated in the diagnostic diagram they employ where the line ratios of [ feii]1.644/br@xmath8 vs [ oi]6300/h@xmath9 produce a separation of the galaxy types , indicating the proposed progression .    when the objects observed here are added to the figure from alonso - herrero et al .",
    "they fall amongst the other galaxies , in the area marked by the authors as the overlap between seyferts and composite galaxies . from this",
    "we would infer a mixture of shock heating and photoionisation as the mechanism for the production of [ feii ] in these galaxies , with the latter process appearing to dominate .",
    "overall , based on these ratios the emission seems to be typically seyfert - like , as expected for these galaxies .",
    "detection of [ sivi ] emission indicates the presence of high energy ionising photons .",
    "this high excitation line has an ionisation potential of 167ev and can not be formed by continuum emission from young stars .",
    "it is a feature only associated with active galaxies , suggesting that the mechanism for its production is photoionisation by an active nucleus @xcite .",
    "the [ sivi ] line is detected for iras17179 and the main nucleus of iras20210 , having fwhm @xmath26  1200 km s@xmath5 in both detections .",
    "this detection confirms the status of these two galaxies as seyferts .",
    "[ sivi ] is not detected in the spectra of the liner type galaxies .",
    "the absence of this line in the spectra of the galaxies of undefined type : iras00150 and iras23420 , does not support the presence of a seyfert nucleus , however the presence of a highly obscured agn can not be ruled out using this criteria alone @xcite .",
    "co absorption arises from the presence of older stars , red giants and supergiants .",
    "there are three main bandheads potentially visible : @xmath53co(2,0 ) at 2.294@xmath3 m , @xmath53co(3,1 ) at 2.323@xmath3 m and @xmath54co(2,1 ) at 2.345@xmath3 m . in our observations , due to the redshift range of the objects observed , detection of these absorption features was potentially only possible in two objects : iras20210 and iras23365 .",
    "both objects show absorption , possibly visible in both nuclei for iras20210 .",
    "figure  [ coband ] shows an expanded view of the spectra of the objects in the relevant waveband , useful to show the co absorption not obvious with the scaling in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the equivalent width of the absorption in the main nucleus of iras20210 is smaller than that of iras23365 .",
    "this is as expected , since emission from heated dust begins to become significant around this wavelength , rising into the mid - infrared . in iras20210 , a sy2 ,",
    "the stronger emission due to hot dust effectively dilutes the measured co absorption bands . in iras23365",
    "the hot dust continuum is less , allowing co absorption to become more evident . in the second nucleus of iras20210 ,",
    "labelled in figure  [ coband ] as iras20210b , the emission is characteristic of an older stellar population : showing co absorption and a lack of recombination emission lines .",
    "additional evidence for the presence of a stronger diluting hot dust continuum comes from the relatively redder spectrum of iras20210 when compared with iras23365 .",
    "we have presented nir observations of a sample of mainly interacting ulirgs , comprising of h and k band spectra . from the analysis of these data",
    "our main aims were to investigate the power source of these extremely luminous objects , the potential excitation mechanisms of the strong molecular hydrogen emission which is often seen in such objects , along with an investigation of the other characteristics such as extinction and multiple nuclei .",
    "our results are summarised below .    of the seven galaxies observed ,",
    "five have previous classifications and the remaining two , iras00150 and iras23420 , have no published optical data other than that used for redshift determination . broadened hi recombination emission was detected in one object , iras23498 , with fwhm @xmath26 5000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this finding is consistent with previous results for this object which is classified as a sy2 .",
    "the high excitation line [ sivi ] is detected in two galaxies in our sample , both are classified as sy2s .",
    "we have investigated several proposed correlations , which as well as exhibiting a specific trend between line ratios , also help to distinguish agn from starburst galaxies . in most cases the galaxies added to the existing data exhibited the expected trend .",
    "we question a correlation found by goldader et al . between l@xmath36 vs l@xmath37 for lirgs .",
    "this is due to the small size of the sample on which the relationship is based .",
    "data points added for the ulirgs suggest either ( 1 ) the need for a different form of correlation , or ( 2 ) that no significant correlation is seen .",
    "regarding the classification of iras00150 and iras23420 , neither spectrum exhibits [ sivi ] emission .",
    "however this does not rule out the presence of highly obscured agn",
    ". it would be useful to obtain good quality optical data for these objects , in order to classify them .",
    "another objective was to provide information on the excitation mechanism of the molecular hydrogen emission observed in the k band . due to",
    "the variation in the number of lines observed , several diagnostic methods were used .",
    "the overall finding for the galaxies in our sample , with the possible exception of iras23365 and iras23420 , is the predominance of thermal excitation .",
    "non - thermal emission is also present in some objects but in varying proportions .",
    "comparison of only a few line ratios indicated very little , and possibly negligible , contribution from non - thermal emission in iras00150 , iras16487 and iras17179 .",
    "more detailed analysis was possible for the other objects in the sample .",
    "iras20210 shows only a small proportion , 10 per cent , of non - thermal contribution to the 10s(1 ) emission .",
    "in contrast , values of 30 per cent non - thermal emission were found for both iras23365 and iras23420 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath2670 per cent of the total h@xmath10 emission .    since most of the galaxies observed",
    "are interacting , one might expect thermal excitation through shocks to be the dominant mechanism .",
    "the obvious exceptions to this are iras23365 ( which indeed shows a higher proportion of non - thermal emission ) , and also iras17179 and iras23420 which are classified as non interacting galaxies.we note that for iras17179 only a few h@xmath10 emission lines were detected , so our conclusions are less certain .",
    "however , the increased fraction of non - thermal emission in iras23420 is consistent with it being non - interacting .",
    "values for reddening were derived for galaxies with available optical data , using nir emission lines in combination with the optical lines .",
    "the results depended on the combination of lines used , with values using only optical lines being consistently smaller than those found using a nir line with an optical line .",
    "this is as predicted since the infrared lines can be detected from more highly reddened regions .",
    "of the four galaxies with optical data , iras23365 showed the highest values of extinction with an average value of a@xmath28 = 4.7 @xmath55 0.8 mag . in comparison",
    "the value found using optical lines only was a@xmath28 = 2.8 mag .",
    "the former value is consistent with that derived by davies et al .",
    ", a@xmath28 = 4.4 mag , found using a model of 500k dust contributing 50 per cent of the k band emission using the nir imaging .",
    "the values of extinction found for the other galaxies were moderate , being in the range a@xmath28 = 2.3  4.5 mag .",
    "there is a bias in our sample towards interacting systems .",
    "for the two for which we have spectra for both nuclei , we find either very weak or no emission lines , indicative of an evolved population , in contrast to the brighter primary nucleus . this trend has also been found for other ulirgs @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the contribution of the secondary nucleus to the ir luminosity of the system was made and in both cases the contribution was found to be minor .",
    "observations of the secondary nuclei of iras16487 and iras23498 would be interesting , to see if these characteristics are shared by secondary nuclei of interacting ulirgs in general .",
    "as mentioned above , all the hydrogen recombination lines detected were narrow , with the exception of iras23498 .",
    "an interesting feature that arises frequently in these objects is the blue shoulder of the pa@xmath9 line .",
    "this feature could be explained by the presence of a blue velocity component .",
    "another possibility is the presence of blended lines , as seen at our spectral resolution , higher resolution spectroscopy is required to make further progress .",
