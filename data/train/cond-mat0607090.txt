    "space - inversion - asymmetry - induced spin precession in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) channels opens the possibility of spin - field - effect transistor ( sfet ) ( ref . ) and is itself an intriguing physical phenomenon in the emerging field of semiconductor spintronics.@xcite the heart of such spin precession lies in the well - known kramers theorem,@xcite which predicts an intrinsic zero - field spin - splitting in inversion - asymmetric crystal structures in the absence of applied magnetic fields .",
    "the corresponding spin - splitting can be described by an effective magnetic field , forcing the transport spins to precess about such fields .    mechanisms of inversion asymmetry in 2deg systems include structure inversion asymmetry , more commonly referred to as the rashba spin - orbit ( rso ) interaction,@xcite of the confining potential , and the bulk inversion asymmetry , referred to as the dresselhaus spin - orbit ( dso ) term for zinc - blende semiconductors,@xcite of the underlying crystal structure . specifically , the rashba term originates from the transformation of the electric field felt by the electron to an effective momentum - dependent magnetic field . hence factors influencing the rso strength involve local charge distribution ( such as charged impurities@xcite or ionized dopant atoms@xcite ) , and applied external electric fields ( usually the gate voltage ) .",
    "perhaps the gate - voltage tunability of the rso strength , quite successfully demonstrated in ingaas / inalas - based ( ref . ) and gaas / alas - based ( refs . and ) quantum wells ( qws ) , determines the precession rate of the injected electron spin , and is therefore the most important key to the realization of the sfet .",
    "however , more than a decade of struggle has still yielded disappointing results .",
    "its failure may be ascribed to the so far less successful factors:@xcite ( i ) efficient spin injection rate and ( ii ) uniformity of the rso interaction .",
    "apart from the most challenging issue  the spin injection problem , nonuniformity of the rso coupling arising from the inherent random distribution of ionized dopants in the vicinity of the 2deg plane has recently attracted certain attention to reexamine the rashba 2deg systems.@xcite this implies that the rso coupling strength @xmath0 should be treated as position dependent , and the corresponding modification to , e.g. , spin precession rate , in the rashba channel must be taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we construct a contour - integral method to deal with spin precession in nonuniform rashba - dresselhaus ( rd ) 2degs along arbitrary paths .",
    "we derive an analytical formula to describe the spin vectors , i.e. , the expectation values of spin operators done with respect to the injected electron spin state , inside the 2deg channel .",
    "the obtained formula is found to be a direct generalization of the previous one,@xcite which is applicable to injected spins with straight space evolution in uniform rd 2degs .",
    "the constructed formalism can straightforwardly deal with the nonuniformity of the rso coupling , dso coupling , and even the effective mass @xmath1 , and is applicable to curved one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels , e.g. , quantum ring structures . throughout this paper ,",
    "single - particle quantum mechanics is used and the effective mass approximation is adopted .",
    "we begin by considering a [ 001]-grown zinc - blende - based 2deg , where the rashba and dresselhaus hamiltonians are described by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . whereas the rso strength @xmath0 stems from the electric field generated by the ionized dopants in the vicinity of the 2deg plane",
    ", @xmath0 is in principle position dependent and material specific . on the other hand , the dso strength , in bulk systems ,",
    "arises from the inversion - asymmetry of the crystal structure and thus may not vary with different positions if the sample is well grown .",
    "however , when restricted to 2degs , the dso parameter @xmath4 depends on the width of the confining quantum well , and may therefore also be position dependent . when the underlying crystal structure of the 2deg channel is not perfectly grown , spatially varying effective mass @xmath5 may also occur .    in the uniform case , where all of the three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 are constant in space , an electron spin injected at @xmath6",
    "can be described by ( see appendix a)@xmath7 when detected at @xmath8 after a straight space evolution @xmath9 . here",

    "the phase difference is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the composite spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "note that in this paper the spatially evolved state ket without superscript , say @xmath18 , means space evolution from position @xmath19 to position @xmath20 through the straight path connecting the two points , while @xmath21 means evolution through path @xmath22 .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.ps    for the nonuniform case , we consider an arbitrary continuous path @xmath22 connecting the injection and detection points , and section the path into @xmath23 pieces ( see fig .",

    ", each section approaches to a straight path with constant @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 , and eqs .",

    "( [ sket_uniform ] ) , we obtain ( see appendix b)@xmath25 where the total phase difference is given by a contour integral@xmath26 compared to the uniform case eqs .",
    "( [ sket_uniform ] ) and ( [ phase diff ] ) , the problem of nonuniform systems is simply extended to integrate the total phase difference encountered by the electron along the path @xmath22 .",
    "we remind here that the above formalism ( and later the derived spin vector formula ) is applicable for nonuniform systems but only with continuous spatial evolution .",
    "propagation along discontinuous paths must be handled by sectioning the path into pieces of continuous ones [ since eq .",
    "( [ spinor overlap ] ) does not hold on discontinuous points ] .",
    "another discontinuity that may crash the above formalism is the reverse of the rd field direction [ at which eq .",
    "( [ spinor overlap ] ) also fails ] . in pure rashba",
    "( such as si - si@xmath27ge@xmath28 asymmetric qws ) cases , the change of sign @xmath29 , due to either the random dopants or the reverse gating induces such discontinuity . in the composite case ( both @xmath0 and @xmath4 nonvanishing ) , the cancellation of the momentum dependence of the rd effective magnetic field at the condition @xmath30 provides possibility to run the sfet in the nonballistic regime @xcite and also contains fundamental physical phenomena.@xcite however , the corresponding field direction may become unstable along @xmath31[110 ] or @xmath31[110 ] directions , even though the field magnitude is still continuous .",
    "when dealing with such systems , one must carefully check the continuity of the rd field direction and do the calculation partitively .",

    "eq . ( [ < s > ] ) recovers the previous spin vector formula @xcite when @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath39 are constants , i.e. , uniform spin precession along straight paths .",
    "in this section we apply our generalized version of spin - vector formula eq .",
    "( [ < s > ] ) with the total phase @xmath40 given by eq .",
    "( [ total phase diff ] ) first to some interesting 1d geometries , including quantum rings and quantum wires , and then to a more realistic 2deg case , where position dependent rso coupling , generated by regular and random distributions of ionized dopants , is present . in all cases ,",
    "we assume constant dso coupling and the electron effective mass .      beginning with an ideal rashba half - ring with ring radius @xmath41 @xmath42",
    ", we inject an electron at one end , and detect @xmath43 down the way along the ring to the other end .",
    "the half - ring is assumed to be ideally 1d and made of ingaas - based materials .",
    "we set the rso parameter @xmath44 and the electron effective mass @xmath45.@xcite    [ pb ]    fig2.ps    two configurations of the injected spin are considered . in ring ( i ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_qr](a ) , we inject the spin with polarization parallel to the radial direction , which is also the eigenstate of this rashba ring case .",
    "as expected , the spin vectors maintain in the radial direction since the spin is injected in its eigenstate and will stay in this state hereafter .",
    "this can also be viewed as a generalized version of our previous proposal of precessionless spin transport wire.@xcite in rashba systems , one can precessionlessly transport spins even through an arbitrary wire shape ( but with continuous curvature ) , once the spin is injected with polarization perpendicular to the wire direction .",
    "next we inject the spin parallel to the tangential direction . as shown in ring ( ii ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_qr](a ) , the injected spin precesses upright down the way to the end .",
    "this is equivalent to the datta - das sfet with a curved 1d rashba channel . whereas the rso coupling induces an effective magnetic field @xmath46 , which is always perpendicular to the electron transport ( @xmath47 @xmath48 the radial direction here ) , rings ( i ) and ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_qr](a ) are both reasonable and expectable . however ,",
    "when the dso coupling is involved , the @xmath49-rotational symmetry is broken , and the spin vectors can not be expected intuitively , but can still be well described by our formula eq .",
    "( [ < s > ] ) [ see rings ( iii ) and ( iv ) in fig . [ fig_qr](a ) ] . to clarify the influence due to the dso , we plot @xmath50 as a function of the ring argument @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig_qr](b ) , where line ( i ) and line ( ii ) exhibit precessionless and complete precessing behaviors , respectively , and change to line ( iii ) and line ( iv ) after getting the dso coupling involved .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig3.ps      we now consider two straight quantum wires with position - dependent rso strength , one being a linear @xmath0 wire and the other a sine - varying @xmath0 wire .",
    "these wires exhibit interesting spin precession behaviors , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_qw ] , where the upper and lower wires , sketched from the side view , correspond to the linear and sine - varying rashba wires , respectively .",
    "as expected , the injected spin rotates with a precession rate increasing with the position , in the linear rashba wire . in the sine case",
    ", the alternate positive and negative rso drives the spin to precess backward ( when @xmath52 ) and forward ( when @xmath53 ) .",
    "these quantum wires may be fabricated by special gating designs , but applicability to the spintronic device is not obvious .",
    "however , the physics indicated here is simple and clear . whereas the magnitude of the rso strength @xmath0 determines the spin precession rate , the sign of @xmath0 controls the precession direction . from the viewpoint of gating",
    ", a strong enough backgate may reverse the electric field direction in the 2deg , and hence the resulting rashba field direction , forcing the spin to precess in an opposite direction . from the viewpoint of the random rashba field ,",
    "such an alternate @xmath0 is similar to that in a symmetric quantum well , e.g. , a si - si@xmath27ge@xmath28 well , and will induce a finite spin relaxation rate.@xcite      finally , we arrive at the crucial but realistic problem : how will the spin precession pattern be modified due to the random rashba field ?",
    "a first guess on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ total phase diff ] ) is that how wide the angle the spin precesses through lies in how much spin - orbit interaction the electron encounters along the path it goes .",
    "a symmetric well , which has a vanishing spatially averaged rso @xmath54 , does not have spin precession pattern within a submicrometer scale , even though there are nonvanishing fluctuating rashba fields .",
    "this is similar to the sine - varying rashba wire shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_qw ] but with a much rapider @xmath0 oscillation period ( @xmath55 atomic sizes ) .",
    "we now consider an asymmetric well , and adopt the same principle introduced by sherman _",
    "@xcite to generate the random rashba field .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig4.ps    specifically , we consider a @xmath56 inas - based 2deg with only a single dopant layer , located at a spacing @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 from the conducting plane",

    "we take the dopant concentration @xmath66 @xmath67 ( same with ref . ) , the permittivity @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the free space permittivity ) , and the lattice constant @xmath70 @xmath59.@xcite using the linear model @xmath71 with @xmath72 @xmath73 for inas,@xcite we obtain the rashba field in the cases of regular and random dopant distributions in figs .",
    "[ fig_randomrashba](a ) and [ fig_randomrashba](b ) , respectively .    in the 2deg channel",
    ", we also take into account the dso coupling by assuming the well thickness @xmath74 @xmath75 , leading to @xmath76 @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 @xmath79 for inas qws ( ref . ) and @xmath80 in the case of rigid walls .",
    "assuming point injection of @xmath81-polarized spins at the left - center of the channel with transport direction [ 110 ] , the spin vector formula eq .",
    "( [ < s > ] ) gives the spin precession patterns , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_randomrashba](c ) for the regular channel and fig .",
    "[ fig_randomrashba](d ) for the random channel .",
    "clearly , the randomness of the dopant distribution distorts the precession pattern , and hence is expected to lower the purity of the spin signal collected at the drain end .",
    "this may bring another difficulty in realizing the datta - das transistor.@xcite moreover , such unpredictable random distribution will eventually cause an uncertainty of the collected spin signal , for each individual 2deg channel , even if the dopant concentration is perfectly controlled .",
    "for example , the standard deviation calculation with the 2deg channel conditions considered here shows that @xmath82 @xmath83 for inas - based and @xmath84 for gaas - based materials .",
    "( here @xmath85 means the standard deviation of the averaged @xmath86 component of the spin signal collected at the drain end in the channel , among a number of different samplings . )",
    "note that we have chosen [ 110 ] as the channel direction , where the rashba and dresselhaus fields are parallel,@xcite and the random effect seems moderate . when analyzing other channel directions such as [ 110 ] , the obtained spin precession pattern will be totally different from the regular case .",
    "last , if we go back to the 1d case and focus on the center path from the source end to the drain end , the distortion of the spin precession curves due to the random rashba field is surprisingly weak [ see figs .",
    "[ fig_randomrashba](e ) and [ fig_randomrashba](f ) ] .",
    "this again supports the suggestion of using 1d or quasi-1d channels for the datta - das transistor.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have derived an analytical formula to describe the spin precession in nonuniform rd 2degs , using a contour - integral method .",
    "the obtained results are applicable for 2deg systems with position - dependent @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 , and curved 1d wires .",
    "numerical examples show interesting spin precession behaviors , and also support the idea of the precessionless spin transport wire@xcite in the rashba ring case .",
    "we have also demonstrated how the spin precession pattern in a rd 2deg may be distorted when taking the random rashba field into account . in the viewpoint of carrying out the sfet , the random rashba effect may distort the regular spin precession pattern in the 2deg channel , especially along weak spin - orbit strength directions . such undesired influence can be suppressed quite well when narrowing down the channel to 1d [ compare figs .

    "while @xmath104 , or the phase difference @xmath105 , depends only on the spin - orbit strength , the physics of @xmath106 , such as the spatial spin precession , does not depend on the injection energy .",

    "however , we will show that , as in the uniform straight case , this phase does not contribute to the spin vector @xmath43 . in the following",
    "we will abbreviate the rd eigenspinor @xmath119 to @xmath120 for simplicity .          where we have further abbreviated @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
