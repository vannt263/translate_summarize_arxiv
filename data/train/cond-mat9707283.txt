    "globule transitions driven by the polymer s second virial coefficient becoming negative .",
    "@xcite in the coil state , the interaction part of the free energy is dominated by interactions between only two parts of the polymer , which are accounted for by the polymer chain s second virial coefficient ( which is general different from the second virial coefficient of the monomers ) .",
    "so , as the second virial coefficient decreases to zero the interactions effectively vanish and the coil becomes ( almost ) ideal .",
    "then on reducing the temperature further the second virial coefficient becomes negative and the coil collapses into a globule .",
    "the coil first becomes ideal before collapsing only when the collapse is driven by the change of sign of the polymer s second virial coefficient .",
    "here , we show that when the monomers are long and rigid the coil  globule transition is not driven by the second virial coefficient becoming negative .",
    "so , the polymer is _ never _ ideal .",
    "when the temperature is reduced the polymer transforms via a strongly first order transition from a swollen coil to a dense crystalline globule .",
    "the use of a virial expansion@xcite in order to describe the contribution of monomer  monomer interactions to the free energy of the polymer is reasonable for spherical monomers with not too short ranged attractive interactions .",
    "however , if the monomers are long and rigid an additional length scale , the length of the monomer @xmath5 , is present .",
    "unless the range of the attraction is as long or longer than this length @xmath5 then the attractive forces between the monomers are highly anisotropic.@xcite then , their effect on the third and higher virial coefficients is larger than on the second virial coefficient.@xcite long rigid monomers behave in a similar way to hard spheres with a short ranged attraction . @xcite .",
    "stell@xcite has shown that , as the range of attraction between the spheres tends to zero , the virial expansion becomes pathological at temperatures such that the attractive interactions make a nonnegligible contribution to the second virial coefficient . here",
    ", we show that the same occurs for long rods as the range of attraction goes to zero .",
    "unless the renormalisation required@xcite on going from the virial coefficients of the monomers to the effective virial coefficients of a polymer completely changes the behaviour of the virial series , the coil  globule transition can not be driven by the renormalised second virial coefficient becoming negative .",
    "the dna double helix is a rather rigid polymer , its persistence length@xcite is @xmath6nm@xcite which is 25 times its diameter of @xmath7 nm . the interaction between dna helices has a much shorter range than 50nm@xcite and so we would expect the behaviour of a dna molecule of length @xmath8 nm , to be qualitatively similar to that of our model polymer chain .",
    "this expectation is borne out , the coil ",
    "globule transition of dna , as for our model , is first order . @xcite",
    "the polymer is a linear chain of @xmath0 cylindrical monomers joined with @xmath9 flexible spacers , see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a spacer is flexible enough to allow the two cylinders which it joins to adopt any relative orientation with equal probability and to lie side - by - side , however , its maximum length is much less that the length @xmath5 of a cylindrical monomer .",
    "we will always consider @xmath0 to be infinite and so the coil  globule transition is a phase transition .",
    "real polymers are , of course , always finite but we do not consider the effect of finite size here .",
    "the cylindrical monomers are of length @xmath5 , and have a hard core of diameter @xmath10 ; when two cylinders overlap the energy of interaction is positive and infinite .",
    "the attractive part of the potential is sticky in the sense that its range is close to zero , it is only nonzero between a pair of cylinders if they almost touch for all of their length , for this to be true they must be almost parallel and their centres of mass must be almost side - by - side , i.e. , only a little more than @xmath10 apart",
    ". we will define what we mean by almost below when we define the potential . when the attractive part of the potential is nonzero it equals @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction @xmath12 between two cylinders , 1 and 2 , is a function of the separation @xmath13 of the centres of mass of the cylinders , and of the angle @xmath14 between the centrelines of the two cylinders .",
    "then , @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 where the vector @xmath17 in cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "the origin of the coordinates is fixed on the centre of mass of cylinder 1 and their @xmath18-axis is along its axis .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 defines how far apart the cylinders can be and still interact via the attractive part of their interactions .",
    "the limit @xmath20 defines a zero range potential , a generalisation to a cylinder of the sticky sphere potential of baxter.@xcite the dependences of the attractive part of the potential @xmath12 on @xmath14 and on the components of @xmath13 are independent ; this is rather artificial but allows a simple evaluation of the second virial coefficient and as @xmath21 is near zero the details of the attractive interaction make little difference to the behaviour of the polymer .    in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are just adjustable parameters . however , for an attractive interaction of range @xmath23 between rods of length @xmath5 the energy of interaction of two parallel rods scales linearly with @xmath24.@xcite this produces a very deep well , or a large @xmath22 in terms of our model . the energy continues to scale linearly with @xmath24 as long as the angle between the two rods is @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the @xmath26 limit of the potential models considered by van der schoot and odijk@xcite is very similar to the @xmath27 , @xmath20 and @xmath28constant limit of eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .",
    "the density of a coil tends to zero as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "thus , the only interactions between distant parts of the chain that count are pair interactions ; the density is so low that the probability of three different parts of the chain coming close enough to interact is vanishingly small.@xcite by distant parts of the chain we mean monomers which are not close together along the chain , i.e. , are separated along the chain by many other monomers . as only pair interactions are important",
    "the excess free energy depends on only one parameter , an effective second virial coefficient @xmath29 .",
    "this is not the same as the second virial coefficient between monomers , @xmath30 .",
    "the effective coefficient @xmath29 is obtained by renormalising @xmath30 ; this ` mixes in ' some of the higher virial coefficients in with @xmath30 to produce @xmath29 .",
    "so , we start by determining @xmath30 and then go on to estimate the higher virial coefficients .    in the limit of the temperature tending to infinity ,",
    "the polymer chain is just a chain of hard cylinders and flexible spacers.@xcite then , @xmath31.@xcite the higher virial coefficients are all very small if @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite thus interactions between pairs of the monomers are close to being independent , and so if two distant ( along the chain ) monomers are interacting the probability of any of the monomers which are adjacent to either of these monomers interacting with either of the original pair of monomers is very low . as it is these interactions which renormalise @xmath30 ,",
    "we conclude that the renormalisation required to derive @xmath29 from @xmath30 is weak and so @xmath33 .",
    "the pair interactions cause the coil to swell so that its radius of gyration scales as @xmath2 , not as @xmath1 as an ideal coil does .",
    "however , they contribute an amount much less than @xmath34 to the free energy per monomer .",
    "@xmath34 is the temperature in energy units .",
    "this can be seen if we examine the interactions between distant and between adjacent monomers .",
    "the interaction between distant pairs of monomers , i.e. , pairs of monomers which are not neighbours or next - nearest neighbours etc . along the chain , is characterised by the fixman parameter@xcite @xmath35 .",
    "if we divide this by @xmath0 to obtain the contribution per monomer we see that the contribution tends to zero as @xmath0 tends to infinity . as for the interaction between adjacent monomers ; it is easy to see that a monomer only very weakly restricts the space available to an adjacent monomer .",
    "thus , the contribution to the free energy from interactions between monomers is small .",
    "then the free energy of our chain is to a good approximation the free energy of an ideal chain .",
    "if the flexible spacers allow each monomer to move freely in a phase space of volume @xmath36 then the free energy per monomer of the coil @xmath37 is @xmath38 of course there is also a term from the momenta but we neglect this as it is the same in all phases .",
    "fixing the volume of phase space to be @xmath36 is consistent with short tethers of length not much larger than @xmath10 .    in order to consider the effect of attractive interactions we start by studying the second and third virial coefficients of sticky cylinders .",

    "then the attractive interactions contribute a finite amount to the value of @xmath30 . putting this dependence of @xmath22 into eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) results in the attractive term in @xmath48 tending to minus infinity as @xmath20 .",
    "the divergence of the twelfth virial coefficient of sticky hard spheres is suppressed by the presence of even very weak polydispersity in the diameter of the spheres .",
    "in contrast , polydispersity in the diameter @xmath10 of sticky rods has little effect : @xmath48 still diverges .    although we can not consider all virial coefficients we are able to find a trend in their behaviour .",
    "the fourth virial coefficient @xmath56 is the sum of the 3 diagrams of fig .",
    "( [ fig2]c).@xcite the most highly connected of these ( with 6 bonds ) does not correspond to a realisable cluster ; @xcite it is not possible for all of the 4 rods to interact simultaneously with all of the other 3 rods via the attractive part of the interaction .",
    "therefore , it is the diagram with 5 bonds ( the middle one of fig .",
    "( [ fig2]c ) ) which dominates at low temperature .",
    "five bonds means a factor of @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the region of integration over which all 5 bonds are simultaneously present scales as @xmath58 .",
    "this result may be derived if we start from the @xmath48 integral and add an extra rod , which interacts with 2 of the existing rods .",
    "the integral over the 3 rods in @xmath48 yields a factor of @xmath59 , then restricting the orientation of the fourth rod introduces an additional factor of @xmath60 .",
    "the centre of mass of the fourth rod must be restricted in all 3 directions in order that it interact with 2 other rods ; this gives a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "so , we can find the order of the diagrams in the @xmath62th virial coefficient with respect to @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath21 by starting from diagrams in the @xmath64th coefficient and adding another rod such that the cluster is still realisable , i.e. , that all the rods can simultaneously interact via all the bonds in the diagram .",
    "however , this quickly becomes tedious as @xmath62 increases .",
    "we have found that the part of @xmath56 due to the attractive interactions scales as @xmath57\\delta^{14}$ ] , and so becomes non - zero at temperatures such that both @xmath30 and @xmath48 are still at their @xmath65 limits .",
    "the trend seems clear , @xmath66 starts to differ from its @xmath65 limit at a temperature which increases with @xmath62 .",
    "so far , we have just studied the virial coefficients of sticky cylinders .",
    "as the third virial coefficient diverges at all temperatures such that the attractive interactions influence @xmath30 , a fluid of sticky cylinders is unstable at these temperatures , just as sticky spheres are.@xcite however , the main object of our study is a polymer chain consisting of an sequence of @xmath0 of these sticky cylinders . in a polymer coil",
    "the effective second virial coefficient is not that of the monomers @xmath30 but is @xmath30 renormalised by the higher coefficients , @xmath29.@xcite the temperature at which the coil is ideal is the temperature at which @xmath29 is zero . at low temperatures the higher virial coefficients are much larger than @xmath30 and so it is reasonable to expect the renormalisation to produce a renormalised @xmath29 which differs substantially from the @xmath30 of eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) . indeed , there is no reason why the scaling of @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 should be the same .",

    "is all we require . the assumption that @xmath67 near the @xmath65 limit is reasonable because then for @xmath32 the higher virial coefficients are all very small . at low temperatures we have little idea of the size of @xmath29 and",
    "so we are unable to construct a virial expansion of the free energy of a coil .",
    "the crossover temperature between these two regimes will be estimated in section v.",
    "a globule , because it is denser than a coil , has a lower entropy .",
    "this is compensated by its lower energy due to attractive interactions between the monomers of the polymer .",
    "our rodlike monomers only attract each other when they are side - by - side and nearly parallel . given this ,",
    "it is easy to see that a monomer has the lowest energy when it is closely surrounded by 6 other monomers , all of which are nearly parallel and have their centres of mass almost in a plane . then the monomer interacts strongly with 6 other monomers , the maximum number possible .",
    "the lowest energy state of the polymer is then just a state which allows every monomer to be surrounded in this way by 6 others .",
    "this occurs in a solid formed from layers of cylinders arranged in 2-dimensional hexagonal lattices .",
    "it is not surprising that the lowest energy is achieved in a solid but it should be noted that our monomers have to lie side - by - side to attract each other and so the energy of any isotropic phase will be much higher than that of a phase with orientational ordering .",
    "in addition the orientational ordering must be very pronounced , the angle the monomers make with the director should not be more than @xmath68 .",
    "the restriction that the centres of mass must be within @xmath69 in order for them to attract each other forces the density to be very high , roughly a fraction @xmath70 of the density of close packing  the maximum possible density . a globule with a volume fraction of , say",
    ", 1% would necessarily have a much higher energy due to the very short range of the attractions .",
    "as we expect a globule of such high density , a cell theory @xcite is used to estimate its free energy .",
    "we consider a very dense layer of cylinders with their centres of mass on a 2-dimensional triangular lattice ; the lattice constant is @xmath71 . as",
    "the interlayer interactions are very weak in our model we do not consider the interactions between monomers in different layers .",
    "( [ fig1]b ) is a schematic of part of such a layer . in a cell theory calculation ,",
    "the nearest neighbours of a particle are fixed at their places in a perfect lattice and the partition function @xmath72 of a particle trapped in the cell formed by them evaluated .",
    "so , the centres of mass of the six neighbours of the particle are fixed at positions @xmath71 away from the centre of the cell of the particle and in the @xmath73-plane of our coordinate system and their centrelines are parallel to its @xmath18-axis .",
    "the cylinder in the cell has 5 degrees of freedom , 3 translational and 2 rotational . as our model",
    "is defined so that the orientational and translational degrees of freedom are decoupled , estimating the volume of phase space available to the rod is straightforward .",
    "the orientational degrees of freedom give a factor of @xmath74 , as for @xmath30 .",
    "we approximate the volume available to the centre of mass of the rod by a hexagonal prism with its axis along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the height of the prism is @xmath75 and the distance from its centre to any of its points is @xmath76 ; its volume is then @xmath77 .",

    "in section ii , we showed only that the when @xmath30 becomes negative the higher coefficients are already negative , and infinite .",
    "now that we have an estimate of the free energy of the globule we can determine the stability of the coil with respect to the globule when @xmath30 becomes negative . in the limit of @xmath81 the second term of @xmath30 , eq .",
