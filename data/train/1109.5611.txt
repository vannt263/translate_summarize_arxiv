    "after the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ ended its activity in 2000 , seven rotation - powered @xmath1-ray pulsars were known ( e.g. , thompson et al . 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , the _ agile _ telescope reported the detection of two other radio pulsars in @xmath1-rays .",
    "the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ was successfully launched in 2008 .",
    "after two years of observations by _ fermi _ , the number of know @xmath1-ray pulsars increased dramatically , to more than sixty , and continue increase ( ray & saz - parkinson 2010 ) . for known @xmath1-ray",
    "pulsars the maximum of the radiated power is concentrated in the @xmath1-ray range , except for the crab pulsar and psr b1509 - 58 , the power of which peaks in hard x - rays .",
    "the pulsar luminosities @xmath2 in @xmath1-rays are a substantial fraction of the spin - down power , @xmath3 ( abdo et al . 2010 ) , where @xmath4 is the spin - down power , @xmath5 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star ( generally taken to be @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 its spin period , and @xmath8 its spin - down rate .",
    "the starting point common to all viable models of pulsars is that strong electric fields are generated in the magnetospheres of rotating neutron stars ( e.g. , michel 1991 ) . the electric field component , @xmath9 , along the magnetic field , @xmath10 , is non - zero and may accelerate particles to ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "the accelerated particles emit @xmath1-rays due to curvature emission and other processes .",
    "some of the @xmath1-rays are converted into @xmath11 pairs in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the pairs screen the field @xmath12 in the pulsar magnetosphere everywhere except for some compact regions called `` gaps '' .",
    "these gaps are , in fact , `` engines '' responsible for the non - thermal radiation of pulsars .    three kinds of gaps have been proposed in trying to explain the non - thermal radiation of pulsars .",
    "the main difference between these is in the site of gaps .",
    "a gap that forms near the magnetic pole of a pulsar is called a polar gap ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) . besides",
    ", an outer gap may form between the surface of null goldreich - julian density and the light cylinder ( cheng , ho , & ruderman 1986a , b ) .",
    "the third possibility is a slot gap located in the space - charge - limited flow along the last closed field line ( arons 1983 ; muslimov & harding 2004 ) .    in conventional models of polar gaps",
    ", it is assumed that created @xmath11 pairs are free ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ; medin & lai 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "however , this assumption is not valid if the magnetic field is higher than @xmath13 g , where @xmath14 g. the reason is that in such a strong field , @xmath1-rays emitted nearly along the curved field lines , adiabatically convert into bound electron - positron pairs ( positronium ) rather than decaying into free pairs ( shabad & usov 1985 , 1986 ; herold et al .",
    "1985 ; usov & melrose 1995 , 1996 ; baring & harding 2001 ; harding & lai 2006 ; thompson 2008 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath11 pairs created in a magnetic field @xmath15 are bound , may be very important for the observational appearances of strongly magnetized pulsars ( usov & melrose 1995 ) . in particular , unlike free pairs , such bound pairs do not screen the electric field @xmath12 near the pulsar , which requires a net charge density to build up . as a result",
    "the pulsar luminosity is higher than it would have been if the created pairs are free . for pulsars with strong surface magnetic fields , @xmath16 , a polar gap is modified by taking into account creation of bound pairs as was suggested by usov & melrose ( 1995 , 1996 ) . in this model ,",
    "the total power carried away by both relativistic particles and radiation , from the polar gap into the magnetosphere , may increase significantly ( up to a few tens times ) in comparison with the conventional polar gap models , and it may be a substantial fraction of the spin - down power . in this letter , we demonstrate that the total power of the modified polar gaps may be enough to explain the observed luminosities of all known strongly magnetized , @xmath1-ray pulsars .",
    "other observational consequences of the modified polar gap model for these pulsars are also discussed .",
    "in the modified polar gap model ( usov & melrose 1985 , 1986 ) , the fraction of the spin - down power carried away by both relativistic particles and radiation from the polar gap into the magnetosphere is estimated as    @xmath17\\ , .",
    "\\eqno(1)\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 s , and @xmath19 is the magnetic field strength at the poles . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the value of @xmath21 is maximum , @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the polar gap luminosity @xmath23 is comparable with the spin - down power .",
    "the modified polar gap model is valid if both @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( usov & melrose 1986 ) , where @xmath26 for @xmath1-ray pulsars satisfied these conditions , measured and derived properties are given in table  1 .",
    "additionally , the parameters of two @xmath1-ray pulsars ( j0633 + 1746 and j1057 - 5226 ) are included in table  1 . in these two cases , the observed efficiency of transformation of the spin - down power into",
    "the non - thermal high - frequency emission is very high , @xmath27 , while the dipolar b - field estimate is only slightly below the value required for bound - pair formation .",
    "the surface magnetic field may be higher than the dipolar estimate and satisfies the requirement of bound - pair formation , @xmath28 , provided one invokes higher - order multipolar components , or an off - centered dipole . to estimate the possible value of @xmath21 for these two pulsars we take @xmath29 g ( see the second lines in table 1 ) .",
    "from table  1 we can see that the predicted value of @xmath21 is about or more than the minimum observed value of the radiative efficiency , @xmath30 , for all strongly magnetized @xmath1-ray pulsars except of psr j2021 + 4026 .",
    "it is worth to note that the @xmath1-ray luminosities of pulsars given in table  1 were only roughly estimated by abdo et .",
    "2010 ) using the following equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance of the pulsar , @xmath33 is the average energy flux in @xmath1-rays , and @xmath34 is the flux correction factor that takes into account the angular anisotropy of the @xmath1-ray emission of pulsars .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is model - dependent and varies from @xmath35 in the outer gap and slot gap models to @xmath36 in the polar gap model ( e.g. , thompson et al .",
    "abdo et al . ( 2010 ) have used @xmath37 throughout the paper , and therefore , the @xmath1-ray luminosities may be overestimated at least a few times .",
    "summarizing , the power carried away by both relativistic particles and radiation from the modified polar gaps into the magnetosphere may be sufficient to explain the non - thermal luminosities of all known strongly magnetized @xmath1-ray pulsars , including psr j2021 + 4026 .    for comparison , in conventional polar - gap models , where the created pairs are assumed to be free , the corresponding fraction of the spin - down power going into both high - energy particles and radiation",
    "may be estimated as ( e.g. , usov & melrose 1995 )    @xmath38 from table 1 we can see that @xmath39 is more than an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath30 except for a few @xmath1-ray pulsars . even taking into account the uncertainty in @xmath40 because of the uncertainty of @xmath34 , we can see that for the main part of the strongly magnetized @xmath1-ray pulsars the inferred high efficiency of conversion of rotational energy into @xmath1-ray radiation can not be explained within the conventional polar - gap models .    for six pulsars the observed luminosities in @xmath1-rays",
    "are not presented in table  1 because their distances are unknown .",
    "equalizing @xmath40 to @xmath41 for these pulsars , upper limits on the distances may be estimates in the frame of the modified polar gap model .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectra of pulsars were fitted by an exponentially cutoff power - law model , @xmath42 , with the photon index @xmath43 in the range 0.7 - 2.4 and the cutoff energy @xmath44 at 0.1 - 7 gev ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 , pilia et al .",
    "2010 ) . these spectra may be explained by curvature radiation of high - energy electrons that escape from the polar caps with the lorentz factor @xmath45 ( harding 1981 , daugherty & harding 1982 ; chiang & romani 1992 ) . the value of @xmath46 is more or less appropriate for primary electrons at the top edge of the polar gap in the conventional polar gap models , in which the density of primary particles is slightly smaller than the goldreich - julian density @xmath47 ( goldreich & julian 1969 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; arons 1981 ) .",
    "to explain the luminosities of @xmath1-ray pulsars , it was suggested by harding ( 1981 ) that the density of the outflowing electrons with lorentz factor @xmath45 is @xmath48 .",
    "although this suggestion is inconsistent with the conventional polar gap models , it may be consistent with the modified polar gap model ( usov & melrose 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , inside the modified polar gaps the primary electrons are accelerated by the electric field @xmath49 to the lorentz factor @xmath50 and generate very hard @xmath1-rays via curvature radiation , where @xmath51 v / cm is the electric field at which ield ionization of bound pairs becomes important .",
    "these @xmath1-rays are absorbed in the magnetic field and create secondary electron - positron pairs with the mean lorentz factor and the density @xmath52 respectively ( usov & melrose 1996 )",
    ". the parameters of the secondary particles are well consistent with those suggested by harding ( 1981 ) to explain both the luminosities and spectra of @xmath1-ray pulsars .    in the frame of the conventional polar gap models ,",
    "it was argued that photon splitting , @xmath53 , and magnetic absorption of photons , @xmath54 , have to reduce the cutoff energy @xmath55 for strongly magnetized @xmath1-ray pulsars , @xmath56  g ( harding et al .",
    "1997 ; baring & harding 2001 ; baring 2004 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observational data on psr b1509 - 58 that has one of the highest magnetic fields , @xmath57 g , and the softest spectrum with a cutoff at @xmath58 mev .",
    "the second softest @xmath1-ray spectrum with @xmath59 gev is that of psr b0656 + 14 , recently observed by _ fermi_. this pulsar has a rather strong magnetic field , @xmath60 g , and its soft @xmath1-ray spectrum may be explained in the same way . at present , however , there are a handful of @xmath1-ray pulsars with surface magnetic fields higher than that at the surface of psr b0656 + 14 , while their @xmath1-ray emission is present to at least a few gev .",
    "one such pulsar is lat psr j0007 + 7303 , in the supernova remnant cta 1 .",
    "this pulsar has one of the hardest @xmath1-ray spectra with @xmath61 gev , while the magnetic field at its poles is @xmath62 g , which is only slightly smaller than the @xmath19-value for psr b1509 - 58 . among other pulsars with hard ( @xmath63 a few gev ) @xmath1-ray spectra and strong ( @xmath64 ) magnetic fields are psr j0631 + 1036 , j0633 + 1746 , j1709 - 4429 , and j2021 + 4026 .",
    "since one expects strong absorption of hard @xmath1-rays in the vicinity of these pulsars ( harding et al .",
    "1997 , baring 2004 ) , it is concluded that ( 1 ) a polar gap model is inconsistent with the available data on the strongly magnetized @xmath1-ray pulsars with hard @xmath1-ray spectra , and ( 2 ) the @xmath1-ray emission of these pulsars arises largely in the outer magnetosphere ( e.g. , abdo et al . 2010 ; michelson , atwood , & ritz 2010 ) .",
    "however , these conclusions may be premature at least for some strongly magnetized @xmath1-pulsars .",
    "indeed , in the modified polar gap model @xmath1-rays generated near the surface of a strongly magnetized pulsar adiabatically convert into bound @xmath11 pairs .",
    "if the photoionization of the bound pairs is small , these pairs mostly flow away from the pulsar vicinity and may annihilate at large distances generating hard @xmath1-rays that escape from the pulsar magnetosphere . in other words ,",
    "bound pairs may be an intermediate agent that transfers @xmath1-rays from the pulsar vicinity to the outer magnetosphere where their absorption is negligible .",
    "the surface temperature of psr b1509 - 58 may be as high as @xmath65 k. besides , this pulsar is a powerful ( @xmath66 erg / s ) source of soft x - rays with a non - thermal ( power - law ) spectrum .",
    "the soft x - ray and @xmath1-ray pulses are phase - aligned , indicating that they are generated in the same region in the pulsar magnetosphere ( near the magnetic poles in the polar gap model ) .",
    "most probably , the bound pairs are mostly ionized by both thermal and non - thermal x - rays before leaving the vicinity of psr b1509 - 58 . in this case",
    ", the formation of bound pairs does not affect the conclusion of harding et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that in the polar gap model the @xmath1-ray spectrum of psr b1509 - 58 is expected to be very soft . as to psr j0007",
    "+ 7303 , there is an upper limit of @xmath67 k ( halpern et al .",
    "recently , caraveo et al . (",
    "2010 ) decreased the upper limit on the surface temperature of psr j0007 + 7303 : @xmath68 k , that is one of the most constraining data points on cooling models of neutron stars .",
    "this makes psr j0007 + 7303 by far the coldest neutron star for its age interval , suggesting the necessity of enhanced neutrino emission for this rather young @xmath1-ray pulsar ( page , geppert , & weber 2006 ; caraveo et al .",
    ". the surface temperature of psr j0007 + 7303 in the cooling model of neutron stars with enhanced neutrino emission may be as low as @xmath69 k ( page et al .",
    "for this temperature , the bound pairs may leave the pulsar vicinity and annihilate far from the pulsar into hard@xmath1-rays , @xmath70 a few gev .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that the observed non - thermal luminosities of strongly magnetized pulsars may be explained in the polar gap model modified by taking into account the process of adiabatical conversion of @xmath1-rays into bound electron - positron pairs in a strong magnetic field , @xmath71 g. the high - energy spectra of @xmath1-ray pulsars may be also explained by the modified polar gap model .",
    "however , all available polar gap models have difficulty in reconciling the observed @xmath1-ray pulses with the known radio pulsar geometry . at present , it is not clear possible or not to overcome this difficulty in the modified polar gap model at least for some strongly magnetized pulsars .",
