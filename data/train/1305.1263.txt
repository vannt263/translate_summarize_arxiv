    "astrophysical jets as highly collimated beams of high velocity material and outflows of less degree of collimation and lower speed are an ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "the jets are observed over a wide range of luminosity and spatial scale , originating from young stars , micro - quasars , or active galactic nuclei .",
    "the common understanding is that magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) are responsible for launching , accelerating , and collimating these jets .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that accretion and ejection is related to each other - one efficient way to remove angular momentum from a disk is to eject it vertically into a jet or outflow .",
    "observational data have confirmed the co - existence of bipolar jets in most jet forming regions .",
    "jet and counter jet appear , however , typically asymmetric in shape with very few exceptions ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "find similar mean velocities in both lobes of the jets observed , while they report asymmetric variations in mass outflow rates and velocities , and suggest that the jet launching mechanism on either side of the disk is not synchronized .",
    "one exception is the jet source hh212 which ejects an almost perfectly symmetric bipolar structure @xcite , suggesting that the causal origin of jet knots is located close to the central engine . on the other hand ,",
    "if jets form naturally asymmetric , and if thus asymmetric jets would need special conditions to be formed , we may ask what is this kind of `` natural '' ejection process and what are the additional conditions for symmetry ?    a small number of papers have a addressed this topic . discuss the mhd origin of the one - sidedness as probably caused by a superposition of a quadrupolar disk dynamo and a stellar dipole .",
    "the first bipolar jet simulation has been published by and follow - up papers .",
    "recent simulations consider asymmetric ejections of stellar wind components from an offset multipole stellar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "velocity asymmetries in protostellar jets have been investigated by , in particular comparing intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms , such as e.g. the field alignment between stellar and disk field or the pressure distribution in the ambient cloud .",
    "both effects seem to play a role and work on different time scales .",
    "@xcite discuss semi - analytical models indicating a counter - rotation of the inner jet and compare them to apply mhd simulations .",
    "to our knowledge , only very few numerical simulations investigating the bipolar launching of disk jets have been performed .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the evolution of both hemispheres of a jet - disk system in order to see whether and how a global asymmetry in the large - scale outflow can be governed by the disk evolution . in a previous paper ( paper i , @xcite )",
    "we have presented detailed model simulations for the jet launching process , investigating a comparative set of various launching parameters such as magnetization ( or plasma - beta ) , disk diffusivity and diffusivity scale height . in this paper ( paper ii )",
    "we continue our investigation concentrating on the _ bipolar _ character of jets and outflows , in particular on the fact that both jet components are mostly observed as asymmetric .",
    "we investigate the launching of bipolar outflows from initially symmetric conditions , and also from a disk structure with slight asymmetries .    with _ launching _",
    ", we denote the process which conveys material from radial accretion into vertical ejection , lifting it from the disk plane into the corona , thus establishing a disk wind . referring to our notation in paper",
    "i we like clarify again that with _ formation _ we denote the process of accelerating and collimating an already existing slow disk wind or stellar wind in to a jet beam .",
    "this paper deals with both processes - launching and formation .    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the numerical setup , the initial and boundary conditions of our simulations with particular emphasis to the approach of simulating both hemispheres .",
    "the general evolution of jet launching is presented in section 3 , where we also present the simulation of a perfectly symmetric jet .",
    "section 4 is then devoted to asymmetric jets and a parameter study comparing jets from different disk setups .",
    "we will discuss their symmetry properties and how symmetry can be broken by the intrinsic disk evolution .",

    "a first option for the diffusivity distribution is to mirror the profile applied in paper i along the equatorial plane , @xmath70 with the alfvn speed @xmath71 and the disk thermal scale height @xmath72 , measured at the midplane and at time zero .",

    "it is clear that for an asymmetric disk evolution , a hypothetical disk mid - plane will not coincide with the equatorial plane .",
    "therefore , in order to consider the spatial evolution of the asymmetric disk structure , it is essential to apply a _ local _ prescription of diffusivity .    among other options ,",
    "one possibility is to relate the magnetic diffusivity to the local pressure or density .",
    "one may assume that the turbulent alfvnic pressure is proportional to the thermal pressure as discussed e.g. by @xcite .",
    "in particular , suggested that if magnetic diffusivity is interrelated to the turbulent _ alfvnic pressure _ , the magnetic diffusivity profile will follow a power law @xmath79 . in this",
    "casse the diffusivity is proportional to the local sound speed @xmath80 .",
    "we may generalize the power law @xmath81 the profile with @xmath82 results in a relatively broad vertical diffusivity profile , wider than the previously used exponential profile eq.[eq : magdiff_global ] .",
    "it has been shown that this will impact the jet acceleration and collimation , maybe more than it effects the launching mechanism itself .",
    "for comparison we have also applied different power laws , such as @xmath45 , or even steeper profiles .",
    "the drawback of the simple profile [ eq : magdiff_cemel ] is that the diffusivity _ decreases _ along the disk is decreasing with radius .",
    "the outer disk material is therefore strongly coupled to the magnetic field , leading to an super efficient angular momentum removal , rapid accretion , and , thus , a short life - time of the outer disk . on the other hand , in case of mri driven turbulence , the mri activity is expected to cease for large radii , where `` dead zones '' for active accretion may exist @xcite .    we have favored another option for the magnetic diffusivity which allows for a disk diffusivity _ increasing _ with radius , @xmath83 thus , we apply a density - weighted `` local disk scale height '' @xmath84 mainly following the local sound speed in the gas flow , @xmath85 and a quenching term in order to avoid numerically problematic diffusivities .",
    "we typically choose @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88,or @xmath89 , @xmath87 , @xmath90 ( simulation run cb14 ) .    essentially , both prescriptions for the magnetic diffusivity eqs .",
    "[ eq : magdiff_cemel ] and [ eq : magdiff_local ] allow for a smooth transition from accretion to ejection , and , also to follow the changes in the local disk structure .",
    "as the outflow density decreases along the streamlines , also the outflow diffusivity decreases . for low densities towards the asymptotic outflow , the ideal mhd will be approached .",
    "a physical motivation can be the following .",
    "turbulently diffusive disk material is lifted from the disk into the disk , and is further accelerated along the outflow while , however , the turbulent motions decay . in paper",
    "i we have estimated the scale height where the turbulence will be damped to be several disk thermal scale heights ( see our discussion above citing @xcite ) .",
    "we first present jet launching simulations resulting in symmetric bipolar jets .",
    "the first example is the evolution of jets following a magnetic diffusivity description fixed in time and space ( case sb1 ) .",
    "this case serves as reference simulation for this paper , and also allows for a comparison to the one - hemispheric simulations of paper i. this inflow - outflow evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipo1_fix_case1 ] .",
    "as we see , the outflow evolves perfectly symmetric in both hemispheres for almost 3000 dynamical time steps , until the outer disk starts to deviate from symmetry due to numerical effects .",
    "however , even for these late time steps , the inner disk , which is the main jet launching area , is still highly symmetric .    in particular",
    "this could be seen in the time - evolution of the mass fluxes .",
    "figure [ fig : bipo1_fix_case1_mass ] shows the accretion rate and the ejection rates into the two hemispheres .",
    "the ejection rates are integrated from @xmath91 to @xmath92 at @xmath93 , while the accretion rate is integrated from @xmath94 till @xmath95 at @xmath62 .",
    "it is not surprising that due to the symmetric diffusivity profile which remains fixed in time together with symmetric initial and boundary conditions , we find a symmetric evolution of both the disk and the outflows .",
    "the symmetric bipolar jet structure we obtain does mainly serve as a test case for the numerical setup , in particular the sink boundary conditions .",
    "while the symmetric evolution is expected on physical grounds , even a little numerical failure in the setup would lead to asymmetry quickly .    in comparison to our one - hemispheric simulation in paper i",
    "( reference run case1 ) , the mass fluxes we measure now are quite similar . as accretion rate for the bipolar simulation we measure @xmath96 ,",
    "while for the previous reference case1 it was @xmath97 the outflow rates for the bipolar simulation are @xmath98 in each direction , which agrees with the @xmath99 in paper i nicely . however , due to the smaller grid extension , the disk mass reservoir is smaller , leading to a faster decay of the disk mass ( see the outer disk structure at @xmath100 ) . therefore , disk accretion and mass ejection decay faster as well .",
    "here we present simulations in which we have disturbed the internal hemispheric disk symmetry .",
    "we have applied two options for disturbing the disk symmetry - either by prescribing a _ global _ asymmetric initial state , or by injecting a _ localized _ overpressure ( an explosion at certain time ) . for both alternatives",
    "we apply a symmetric magnetic diffusivity prescription eq .",
    "[ eq : magdiff_global ] , constant in time .",
    "option i is to prescribe an initial disk structure with a global pressure asymmetry in both disk hemispheres . in our model , we achieve this by applying a different thermal disk scale height for the initial disk in each hemisphere . in simulation sb2",
    "we have applied @xmath101 for the upper hemisphere and @xmath102 for the lower hemisphere .",
    "consequently , we have a density and a pressure jump across the equatorial plane , @xmath103 .",
    "the disk turns into an asymmetric evolution right from the beginning , evolving into a warped structure along the midplane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bipo1_fix_case2 ] ) .",
    "a series of warps is visible along the disk with warp amplitudes of a few local disk scale heights .",
    "after about 1000 dynamical time steps the warp amplitudes start to decrease - first along the inner disk , while the outer disk still in a warped state .",
    "the disk asymmetry is reflected in the jet evolution . along with the initial asymmetric disk evolution ,",
    "the jets launched from the inner disk are asymmetric as well .",
    "this is clearly visible in the poloidal magnetic field structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bipo1_fix_case2 ] ) , but also in the mass fluxes we measure .",
    "we also note a different time scale in the jet propagation .",
    "the upper jet reaches the grid boundary earlier than the lower jet which is delayed by about @xmath104 ( note that this obviously depends on the grid size , and happens rather early at @xmath105 ) .",

    "we find that at early stages , @xmath106 , the lower outflow carries about 80% of the mass load of the upper outflow . from @xmath107",
    "an asymmetric inflow - outflow system is established .",
    "the differences in mass flux are now about 10% .",
    "after @xmath108 , the variation in the outflow rates decreases , and the inner disk has established a symmetric structure .",
    "the same behavior is also visible in the velocity distribution .",
    "figure [ bicase2_innerdisk1 ] shows the complex velocity field of the inner disk .",
    "accretion starts first in the innermost disk regions . the disk asymmetry is well reflected in the @xmath109-distribution .",
    "however , after @xmath110 the system turns to a symmetric geometry .",
    "we also see the highest accretion velocities in the upper disk layers .",
    "one may indicate this as _ layered accretion _",
    ", however , due to the higher density in the lower disk layers , the radial mass flux is more almost distributed over the disk height .",
    "we believe that the disk evolution into a symmetric state is given by two reasons .",
    "firstly by the restoring force of the symmetric gravitational potential , and secondly by the symmetry and the time - independent prescription of the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the latter is interesting since it is a second - order effect only , as the magnetic diffusivity does not provide a force term in the mhd equations which could directly re - configure the disk structure .",
    "the diffusion time scale @xmath111 is about 100 dynamical time scales for @xmath112 at radius @xmath113 .",
    "so far we have concentrated on the inflow - outflow dynamics close to the jet launching region .",

    "we find that the mass flux asymmetry of about 5% at the launching region propagates to the asymptotic region , where we find a similar mass flux difference .",

    "however , at @xmath127 , when a quasi steady state of the inner inflow - outflow structure is reached , we disturb the symmetry of the disk structure by inserting a localized over pressure in the upper disk hemisphere , probably similar to an explosion ( see fig .  [",

    "in order to allow the disk and jet to follow a truly asymmetric evolution , without the restoring effects of a symmetric , global magnetic diffusivity distribution , we have applied a _ local _ description of diffusivity which follows the local evolution of disk and outflow ( see tab .  [ tbl : bicases ] ) .",
    "the results of this section are somewhat preliminary , as a physically self - consistent parametrisation for a local magnetic ( turbulent ) diffusivity is not available . in order to investigate the main features of the local approach , we have applied two diffusivity distributions .",

    "the main difficulty one faces with a local description is a feedback mechanism such that low densities lead to a lower diffusivity , thus stronger matter - field coupling , thus more efficient angular momentum removal and a faster accretion , which leads to even lower densities .",

    "we will present a detailed investigation of this feedback mechanism in a forthcoming paper .    applying a more sophisticated prescription of the magnetic diffusivity following eq .",
    "[ eq : magdiff_local ] , the over - all accretion - ejection evolution is more similar to the picture established by the simulations using a global diffusivity profile . the fundamental difference is , however , the longer lasting and more persistent asymmetry in the disk and the outflows .",
    "figure [ fig : cf10-eta ] shows the time evolution of magnetic diffusivity and the magnetic field for a simulation with a more sophisticated local setup of magnetic diffusivity following eq .  [ eq : magdiff_local ] .",

    "since the diffusivity profile is broader in vertical direction , mass loading and angular momentum removal is more efficient , establishing higher accretion and outflow rates - in agreement with our results in paper i.    the outflow mass fluxes develop a clearly asymmetric structure .",

    "the asymptotic jet mass fluxes integrated from @xmath91 to @xmath145 , along a surface @xmath146 are somewhat lower ( due to the fact that some of the material injected into the outflow leaves the grid in radial direction ) , and still differ on a 15%-level .",
    "this section is devoted to the question whether jet asymmetries are due to external of internal interaction .",
    "it seems clear that the conditions in the ambient gas the jet is penetrating , will certainly affect the expansion and the collimation on the large scales .",
    "here we consider a model setup , in which the bipolar outflow is launched intrinsically symmetric from a ( symmetric ) disk into an asymmetric star - disk corona .",

    "however , the asymmetry is clearly transient .",
    "as soon as the initial coronal material is swept out of the computational domain , the accretion - ejection system returns to hemispheric symmetry .",
    "this is well visible in the mass flux evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bicase5_massfluxes ] ) , which shows a drastic asymmetry during the first hundreds of time steps .",
    "again it is interesting to see various time lags in the flow evolution .",
    "firstly , the time lag between the launching time of the initial asymmetry and the arrival time of asymmetric features in the asymptotic region .",
    "secondly , the time lag between the time step when the disk - outflow system has returned to symmetry , and the time when the outflow symmetry has reached the asymptotic jet .",
    "note that in these simulations the disk structure itself stays rather symmetric , in difference to the simulations discussed above , where we see the disk evolving into a warped structure .",
    "however , we can see back reaction of the asymmetric outflow onto the disk structure in this approach .",
    "the two asymmetric jets drive a different electric current system in both hemispheres .",
    "both the current systems are connected within the disk - subsequent mhd forces therefore slightly distort the symmetric hydrodynamic disk structure .",
    "the deviation from symmetry is , however , not as strong as for the previous cases in which we start with an initially asymmetry disk .",

    "the outflow rates at larger distance from the source differ similarly , however , asymmetry last longer , just because of the propagation time of the material launched from the disk .",
    "\\(3 ) we then started the simulation with symmetric initial setup , but disturbing the symmetric disk structure by a localized ( in time and space ) explosion at the time when a symmetric outflow is already well established .",
    "as for ( 2 ) , a asymmetric outflow arises after the injection , however , after a time delay due to the propagation time of the asymmetric injection along the disk towards the main jet launching area . on the long term",
    "a symmetric outflow is re - established .",
    "\\(4 ) we then investigated the disk - jet evolution applying a _ local _ prescription of magnetic diffusivity @xmath158 following the local disk evolution .",
    "we find that - as discussed in paper i - the distribution of magnetic diffusivity affects the disk evolution ( and subsequently the outflow evolution ) essentially , as it governs the coupling between matter and field , and , thus the angular momentum evolution , the disk accretion , the magneto - centrifugal acceleration , and also the mass loading of the outflow .",
    "we first applied a simple power law diffusivity distribution as motivated by earlier papers .",
    "we observed a strong feedback such that for low densities an almost ideal mhd situation leads to super - efficient accretion with weak outflows and strongly decaying disk mass .",
    "these features deserve further attention which will be the focus of a forthcoming paper .",
    "\\(5 ) for a more sophisticated magnetic diffusivity distribution following the density - weighted _ local _ sound speed , and an increasing diffusivity with radius , the accretion evolution is more persistent .",
    "we were able to follow the accretion - ejection process over many thousands of dynamical time steps .",
    "the most interesting result is that the bipolar asymmetry of jet and counter jet is _ long - lasting_. we find that in this case the warped structure of the disk survive many dynamical time scales also in the inner disk .",
    "we interpret this as due to the lack of a symmetric diffusivity distribution .",
    "there are the same restoring forces of gravity as in the case of a symmetric diffusivity profile . however , the matter is more directly coupled to the distorted magnetic field which in principle opposes the return to symmetry . in the end we observe a persistent difference in the jet - counter jet mass fluxes - up to 30% and lasting longer than the simulation run time .",
    "\\(6 ) in order to compare between internal and external effects we also investigated the launch of a jet outflow from a symmetric disk into an asymmetric ambient gas distribution .",
    "as probably expected the initial outflow is strongly asymmetric , with 20% different mass fluxes for jet and counter jet , however as soon as the outflow has penetrated the asymmetric corona ( i.e. when the outflow has left the grid , and the initial condition has swept out of the domain , the outflow returns to symmetry ( after about 2000 dynamical time steps ) . in comparison to the simulations discussed about , the initial disk structure is symmetric and does not evolve into a warped structure .",
