    "differential cryptanalysis plays a central role in attacking modern crypto systems , especially in block ciphers @xcite .",
    "now , this method has been developed to various forms , such as truncated differential attack @xcite and impossible differential attack @xcite .",
    "however , current ciphers ( such as aes ) were designed along the wide trail strategy to resist differential cryptanalysis . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum computation based on quantum mechanics has been built up , and has shown great speedups over classical computation in some areas .",
    "it is thus conceivable to use quantum algorithms in differential cryptanalysis .",
    "deutsch and jozsa @xcite presented a quantum algorithm to distinguish a balanced boolean function from a constant function efficiently without error , which first show exponential speedup over classical algorithm . using the same network as the above algorithm ,",
    "bernstein and vazirani @xcite gave a quantum algorithm to identity linear functions .",
    "later , simon @xcite suggested a quantum algorithm for finding the period of a boolean function .",
    "inspired by simon s algorithm , shor @xcite discovered polynomial - time algorithms for factoring integers and solving discrete logarithms .",
    "different from the above algorithms which rely on some promises of the problems , grover s algorithm @xcite searches a target element in an unsorted database and shows a quadratic speedup over the classical one .    in recent years , researches of quantum algorithm mainly focus on developments of the above mentioned algorithms .",
    "for example , there are quantum tests for whether a function has some properties or @xmath0-far from it @xcite , and there are also quantum algorithms for learning of boolean functions @xcite , but still with a promise that the boolean functions belong to a small special set . meanwhile , there are quantum polynomial algorithms to approximate some problems @xcite . amongst these algorithms , @xcite gave an efficient algorithm to find some high probability differentials of a boolean function .",
    "in @xcite , the authors gave quantum related - key attacks based on simon s algorithm .",
    "[ [ our - contributions . ] ] * our contributions . * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    inspired by @xcite , using the result in @xcite , and combining with the classical differential cryptanalysis approach , we investigated the differential cryptanalysis based on quantum algorithm and gave quantum algorithms to implement the differential cryptanalysis .",

    "regarding the quantum differential cryptanalysis methods , one must mention @xcite , which presented a quantum differential cryptanalysis based on the quantum counting and searching algorithms , and obtained a quadratic speedup over classical one .",
    "their quantum algorithm is used after the time that the differential characteristics has been found .",
    "contrary to the above works , our quantum algorithms are to find the differential characteristics .",
    "in this section , we give some preliminaries and notations , which will be used in the following sections .",
    "let @xmath1 be a multi - output boolean function with input @xmath2 and output @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are both positive integers .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 , then @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called the input difference and output difference , respectively , where @xmath9 is the bit - wise exclusive - or . hence , @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the pair @xmath14 is called a _",
    "differential_.    a _ differential characteristic _ is composed of input and output differences , where the input difference to one round is determined by the output difference of the last round .",
    "differential cryptanalysis is a chosen - plaintext attack .",
    "it is usually used to attack various block ciphers . roughly speaking , differential cryptanalysis",
    "is composed by two procedures :    \\1 .",
    "find some high probability differential characteristics .",
    "\\2 . according to the differential characteristics which have been found , test possible candidate subkey",
    ", then recover the key of the cryptosystem .    in this paper ,",
    "our quantum algorithm is used at the first process . while in @xcite , their quantum algorithm was at the second stage .      before showing the bernstein ",

    "in other words , for any vector @xmath74 in @xmath70 , @xmath76 is a differential of @xmath52 with the probability more than uniform distribution .",

    "the time of running the bernstein ",
    "vazirani algorithm ( in order to evaluate the function @xmath45 ) is @xmath94 , and the time needed to solve the system of linear equations is @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 is another polynomial of @xmath28 ) .",
    "so the total time of algorithm 1 is @xmath97 .",
    "the maximum time of running the algorithm 2 is @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , this upper bound may be a little rough , because for some @xmath99 , they may be not in @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where the @xmath102 is much less than @xmath103 .",

    ". generally speaking , the s - box used in a block cipher is not large , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath103 are both small , so @xmath120 is very small too . in other words ,",
    "evaluation of the difference distribution table is very efficient , our quantum algorithm does not show much speedup over the classical algorithm .",
    "however , that provide a new approach to the problem , and may throw light on some other questions .",
    "the above method only focuses on each s - box . in the following",
    ", we will give another method .",
    "the difference is it will focus on the entire process of the encryption .",
    "recall that the difficulty in the differential cryptanalysis is to construct high probability differential characteristics . and in the classical differential cryptanalysis , high probability differential characteristics are unambiguously given , from which s - box to which s - box .",
    "in fact , the purpose of doing that is to find which input differences will probably lead to which output differences . in the following , we will give a quantum algorithm to complete this .",
    "assume @xmath121 is a function which maps the plaintext @xmath106 to the input @xmath29 of the last round under a secret key @xmath122 .",

    "if @xmath88 and @xmath89 for a @xmath102 , then @xmath74 must not their shared differential . at this time , breaking out of the loop is for saving time .",
