    "our research is inspired by the use of wireless directional antennas in building communication networks . unlike an omnidirectional antenna , which transmits energy in all directions , a directional antenna can concentrate its transmission energy within a narrow cone ; the narrower the cone , the longer the transmission range , for a fixed transmission power level .",
    "directional antennas are preferable over omnidirectional antennas , because they reduce interference and extend network lifetime , two criteria of utmost importance in wireless networks operating on scarce battery resources .    directed yao edges",
    "can be realized with narrow directional antennas ( otherwise called laser - beam antennas , to imply a small cone angle , close to zero ) .",
    "one attractive property of yao graphs is that they can be efficiently constructed locally , because each node can select its incident edges based on the information from nodes in its immediate neighborhood only .",
    "this enables each node to repair the communication structure quickly in the face of dynamic and kinetic changes , providing strong support for node mobility .",
    "the limited number of antennas per node ( @xmath31 to @xmath32 in practice ) , raises the fundamental question of connectivity of yao graphs @xmath33 , for small values of @xmath10 .",
    "if the communication graph induced by antennas operating in omnidirectional mode is connected , by how much must an antenna radius increase to guarantee that @xmath10 laser - beam antennas at each node , pointing in the direction of the @xmath33 edges , preserve connectivity ? in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on small @xmath10 values ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath32 ) corresponding to the number of antennas commonly used in practice .",
    "yao graphs have been extensively studied in the area of computational geometry , and have been used in constructing efficient wireless communication networks  @xcite . applying the yao structure on top of a dense communication graph , in order to obtain a sparser graph , is a very natural idea .",
    "most existing results concern yao graphs @xmath36 $ ] with @xmath37 .",
    "these graphs exhibit nice spanning properties , in the sense that the length of a shortest path between any two nodes @xmath38 $ ] is only a constant times the euclidean distance @xmath39 separating @xmath11 and @xmath40  @xcite . in the context of using laser - beam antennas to realize @xmath33",
    "however , these results could only be applied if @xmath41 or more antennas were available at each node , which is a rather impractical requirement .",
    "few results exist on yao graphs @xmath33 , for small values of @xmath10 ( below @xmath41 ) .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] are not spanners  @xcite , and that @xmath44 $ ] is a spanner  @xcite . however , as far as we know , no results exist on @xmath12 $ ] , for any fixed radius @xmath19 .",
