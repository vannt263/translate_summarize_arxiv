    "it is well known that , in particle physics , the string model is frequently used to study the structure of hardrons . in fact , a free string is a one - dimensional physical object whose motion is represented by a time - like surface . on the other hand , in mathematics , extremal surfaces in a physical space - time include the following four types : space - like , time - like , light - like or mixed types . for the case of space - like extremal ( minimal or maximal ) surfaces in the minkowski space - time , we refer to the classical papers by calabi @xcite and by cheng and yau @xcite .",
    "the case of time - like extremal surfaces in the minkowski space - time has been investigated by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "barbashov , nesterenko and chervyakov in @xcite study nonlinear partial differential equations describing extremal surfaces in the minkowski space - time and provide examples with exact solutions .",
    "milnor @xcite generates examples that display considerable variety in the shape of entire time - like extremal surfaces in the 3-dimensional minkowski space - time @xmath1 and shows that such surfaces need not be planar . for the case of extremal surfaces of mixed type , gu investigates the extremal surfaces of mixed type in the @xmath2-dimensional minkowski space - time ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and constructs many complete extremal surfaces of mixed type in the 3-dimensional minkowski space - time ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . recently , kong et al re - study the equations for time - like extremal surfaces in the minkowski space - time @xmath3 , which corresponds to the motion of an open string in @xmath3 ( see @xcite-@xcite ) . for",
    "the multidimensional version , hoppe et al derive the equation for a classical relativistic membrane moving in the minkowski space - time @xmath4 , which is a nonlinear wave equation corresponding to the extremal hypersurface equation in @xmath4 , and give some special classical solutions ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the cauchy problem with small initial data for the time - like extremal surface equation in the minkowski space - time has been studied successfully by lindblad @xcite and , by chae and huh @xcite in a more general framework . using the null forms in christodoulou and klainerman s style ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , they prove the global existence of smooth solutions for sufficiently small initial data with compact support .    in @xcite , kong",
    "et al investigate the dynamics of relativistic ( in particular , closed ) strings moving in the multidimensional minkowski space - time @xmath5 .",
    "they first derive a system with @xmath2 nonlinear wave equations of born - infeld type which governs the motion of the string .",
    "this system can also be used to describe the extremal surfaces in @xmath3 .",
    "then they show that this system enjoys some interesting geometric properties .",
    "based on this , they give a sufficient and necessary condition guaranteeing the global existence of extremal surfaces without space - like point for given initial data .",
    "this result corresponds to the global propagation of nonlinear waves for the system describing the motion of the string in @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , a great deal of numerical analysis are investigated , and the numerical results show that , in phase space , various topological singularities develop in finite time in the motion of the string .",
    "more recently , kong and zhang furthermore study the motion of relativistic strings in the minkowski space @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , they obtain a general solution formula for this complicated system of nonlinear wave equations . based on this solution formula , they successfully prove that the motion of closed strings is always time - periodic .",
    "moreover , they further extend the solution formula to finite relativistic strings .    however , in a curved space - time there are only few results to obtain ( see @xcite and sections 24 and 32 in @xcite ) .",
    "gu @xcite shows that the motion of a string can be determined by constructing a certain wave map from the minkowski plane to the enveloping space - time which is a given lorentzian manifold .",
    "later , gu investigates the cauchy problem for wave maps from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and proves a theorem on the existence of global smooth solutions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , in @xcite we consider the motion of relativistic strings in the schwarzschild space - time , and under suitable assumptions we prove a global existence theorem on smooth solutions of the cauchy problem for the equations for the motion of relativistic strings with _ small _ arc length .",
    "in this paper we consider the nonlinear dynamics of a relativistic string moving in a curved space - time . as a general framework",
    ", we first analyze relativistic string equations , i.e. , the basic equations for the motion of a one - dimensional extended object in a curved enveloping space - time @xmath0 which stands for a general lorentzian manifold , and then investigate some interesting properties enjoyed by these equations .",
    "based on this , under suitable assumptions we prove the global existence of smooth solutions of the cauchy problem for relativistic string equations in the curved space - time @xmath0 . since the ori s space - time has recently received much attention mainly due to the fact that it is a time - machine solution with a compact vacuum core of the einstein s field equations ( see @xcite ) , we particularly consider the motion of a relativistic string in the ori s space - time , and give a sufficient and necessary condition guaranteeing the global existence of smooth solutions of the cauchy problem for relativistic string equations in the ori s space - time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of a relativistic string moving in a general curved space - time .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study on the motion of a relativistic string in the ori s space - time .",
    "the conclusion and discussion are given in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the motion of a one - dimensional extended object in the enveloping space - time @xmath8 , which stands for a given general lorentzian manifold .",
    "since the world sheet of the one - dimensional extended object corresponds to a two - dimensional extremal sub - manifold , denoted by @xmath9 , we may choose the local coordinates @xmath10 in @xmath9 .",
    "for simplicity , we also denote @xmath11 .",
    "let the position vector in the space - time @xmath0 be @xmath12 denote @xmath13 then the induced metric of the sub - manifold @xmath9 can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 as a result , the corresponding euler - lagrange equations for the one - dimensional extended object moving in the space - time @xmath0 read @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the inverse of the metric @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for the connections of the metric @xmath21 and the induced metric @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "since we are only interested in the physical motion , we may assume that the sub - manifold @xmath9 is @xmath22 and _ time - like _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath23 this implies that the world sheet of the extended object is time - like , and then the motion satisfies the causality , or say , the motion is physical .    under the assumption ( [ 2.5 ] ) , the global solution to ( [ 2.4 ] ) is diffeomorphic to the global solution of the following equations provided with the same initial data ( see @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath24 so in this paper it suffices to investigate the global existence of smooth solutions of the system ( [ 2.6 ] ) instead of ( [ 2.4 ] ) .",
    "the mapping ( [ 2.1 ] ) described by the system ( [ 2.6 ] ) is essentially a wave map from the minkowski space @xmath6 to the lorentzian manifold @xmath0 .",
    "gu @xcite proved that the solution of the cauchy problem for the harmonic map @xmath25 exists globally , where @xmath26 is a riemannian manifold .",
    "according to the authors knowledge , there exists only a few results on the wave map from @xmath6 to a general lorentzian manifold .",
    "notice that the system ( [ 2.6 ] ) can be written in the following form @xmath27 introduce @xmath28 and denote @xmath29 then the system ( [ 2.7 ] ) can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 in which @xmath33 and @xmath34 by a direct calculation , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath35 read @xmath36 the right eigenvector corresponding to @xmath37 can be chosen as @xmath38 where@xmath39 while , the left eigenvector corresponding to @xmath40 can be taken as @xmath41    under the assumption ( [ 2.5 ] ) , the system ( [ 2.10 ] ) is a non - strictly hyperbolic system with @xmath42 eigenvalues ( see ( [ 2.14 ] ) ) , and the corresponding right ( resp .",

    "obviously , it holds that @xmath43 we next calculate the invariants @xmath44 and @xmath45    in fact , for every @xmath46 , by a direct calculation we obtain @xmath47 and @xmath48 then we have @xmath49 similarly , we can prove @xmath50 thus , the proof is completed .",

    "moreover , these two riemann invariants satisfy @xmath54    * proof . *",
    "multiplying ( [ 2.10 ] ) by the left eigenvectors given by ( [ 2.16 ] ) leads to @xmath55 noting ( [ 2.19 ] ) and using ( [ 2.22 ] ) , we have @xmath56 by a direct calculation , @xmath57 on the other hand , notice that ( [ 2.13 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath58 then , substituting ( [ 2.17 ] ) , ( [ 2.24 ] ) and ( [ n1 ] ) into ( [ 2.23 ] ) yields @xmath59 similarly , we can prove @xmath60 thus , the proof is completed .",
    "@xmath51    the system ( [ 2.21 ] ) is a @xmath61 quasilinear hyperbolic system with linearly degenerate characteristic fields , it plays an important role in our argument .",

    "since we only consider the physical motion , it is natural to assume that @xmath85 the condition ( [ 2.33 ] ) is equivalent to the fact that the assumption ( [ 2.5 ] ) is satisfied at the initial time , i.e. , the motion is physical at the time @xmath86 .    under the assumption ( [ 2.33 ] ) , by kong and tsuji @xcite , the cauchy problem ( [ 2.21 ] ) , ( [ 2.32 ] ) has a unique global @xmath73 solution @xmath87 defined on @xmath88 if and only if , for every fixed @xmath89 , it holds that @xmath90 in fact , the condition ( [ 2.34 ] ) guarantees that the motion is always physical for all time @xmath91 .    by the same method as in he and",
    "kong @xcite , we can prove the following theorem .",
    "suppose that @xmath92 is a lorentzian metric , @xmath93 is a @xmath22-smooth vector - valued function with bounded @xmath22-norm and @xmath94 is a @xmath73-smooth vector - valued function with bounded @xmath73-norm .",
    "suppose furthermore that the assumptions ( [ 2.33 ] ) and ( [ 2.34 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "then there exists a positive constant @xmath95 such that the cauchy problem ( [ 2.6 ] ) , ( [ 2.28 ] ) admits a unique global @xmath22-smooth solution @xmath96 for all @xmath97 , provided that @xmath98    in theorem 2.2 , the constant @xmath95 only depends on the @xmath22-norm of @xmath82 and the @xmath73-norm of @xmath83 .",
    "the first inequality in ( [ 2.35 ] ) implies that the @xmath99-norm of @xmath71 is small , that is , the arc length of the initial string is small ; while the second inequality in ( [ 2.35 ] ) implies that the @xmath100-norm of the initial velocity is small .",
    "the physical meaning of theorem 2.2 is as follows : for a string with small arc length , the smooth motion exists globally ( or say , no singularity appears in the whole motion process ) , provided that the @xmath100-norm of the initial velocity is small . in geometry , theorem 2.2 essentially gives a global existence result on smooth solutions of a wave map from the minkowski space - time @xmath6 to a general curved space - time ( cf .",
    "since the ori s space - time has recently received much attention mainly due to the fact that it is a time - machine solution with a compact vacuum core of the einstein s field equations , in this section we mainly investigate the motion of a relativistic string in the ori s space - time , and give a sufficient and necessary condition guaranteeing the global existence of smooth solutions of the cauchy problem for relativistic string equations in the ori s space - time .    as discussed in section 2 , under the assumption ( [ 2.33 ] ) , the cauchy problem ( [ 2.21 ] ) , ( [ 2.32 ] ) has a unique global @xmath73 solution @xmath87 on @xmath88 if and only if , for every fixed @xmath89 , ( [ 2.34 ] ) holds .",
    "moreover , on the existence domain of the solution , it always holds that @xmath101 see kong and tsuji @xcite .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we assume that ( [ 2.33 ] ) and ( [ 2.34 ] ) are always satisfied .",
    "on the other hand , it follows from serre @xcite that the solution @xmath102 of the cauchy problem ( [ 2.21 ] ) , ( [ 2.32 ] ) satisfies the following identity @xmath103 this allows us to introduce the following transformation of the variables @xmath104 where @xmath105 is given by @xmath106    the following lemma comes from he and kong @xcite .    under the assumptions ( [ 2.33 ] ) and ( [ 2.34 ] ) , the mapping defined by ( [ 3.2])-([3.4 ] ) is globally diffeomorphic ; moreover , it holds that @xmath107    the mapping defined by ( [ 3.2])-([3.4 ] ) is somewhat similar to the transformation between the euler version and lagrange version for one - dimensional gas dynamics .    by lemma 3.1 , under the coordinates @xmath108 , the system ( [ 2.26 ] ) can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",

    "we would like to mention that , when the target manifold is riemannian instead of lorentzian , the global existence of smooth solutions to the system ( [ 3.10 ] ) has been proved by gu @xcite successfully .",
    "recently , ori @xcite presented a class of curved space - time vacuum solutions which develop closed timelike curves at some particular moment , and then used those vacuum solutions to construct a time - machine model .",

    "take @xmath129 for some positive constant @xmath130 .",

    "in fact , once one solves @xmath132 from the last equation , then the second and third equations in ( [ 3.17 ] ) become linear , and then one can easily solve the unknown functions @xmath133 and @xmath134 from the second and third equations in ( [ 3.17 ] ) . after solving @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath132 , by substituting them into the first equation in ( [ 3.17 ] ) , one can find that the first equation in ( [ 3.17 ] ) also becomes linear , and then one can easily solve @xmath135 from it .",
    "therefore , in what follows , it suffices to consider the last equation in ( [ 3.17 ] ) .    in order to solve the last equation in ( [ 3.17 ] ) , denoted by ( [ 3.17])@xmath136",
    ", we first gives the corresponding initial data .",
    "in fact , the half plane @xmath137 in the coordinates @xmath108 becomes the half plane @xmath138 in the coordinates @xmath113 , while the initial line @xmath86 becomes the line @xmath139 .",

    "it is well known , in particle physics , the string model is used to consider the structure of hardrons . a free string is a one - dimensional physical object whose motion is represented by a time - like extremal surface in the physical space - times .",
    "the extremal surfaces play an important role in both mathematics and physics , in particular , in the theoretical apparatus of elementary particle physics .",
    "the theory on the motion of a relativistic string in the minkowski spacetime has been studied extensively , many and beautiful results have been obtained .",
    "however , the study on the motion of a relativistic string in curved space - times is vastly open , there are a lot of fundamentally important problems needed to solve .",
    "the main difficulty is that the pdes for such a motion are essentially nonlinear .",
    "in fact , the motion of a string in a curved enveloping space - time @xmath0 , which stands for a given general lorentzian manifold , can be determined by constructing a certain wave map from the minkowski plane to @xmath0 .",

    "this is a hard task .",
    "however , in the gaussian coordinates , the lorentzian metric of the ( curved ) space - time described by the einstein s field equations can be written , at least locally , as @xmath168 where @xmath169 stands for a riemannian metric .",
