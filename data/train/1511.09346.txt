    "a crucial difference between classical and quantum systems is the fact that in the latter ones the entropy of a subsystem can be positive even when the whole system is in its ( pure ) ground state at zero temperature .",
    "indeed , classically a positive value of the entropy is simply a reflection of the lack of knowledge of the precise microstate of the system when it is in a certain macrostate . on the other hand ,",
    "an essential property of quantum systems is the fact that the exact knowledge of the state of the whole system does not give complete information about the state of a subsystem .",
    "this is a consequence of the entanglement among different parts of the system , which is perhaps the most paradigmatic quantum phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "one of the most widespread quantitative measures of the degree of entanglement of a quantum system at zero temperature is the bipartite entropy of its ground state  @xmath13 .",
    "more precisely , if we divide the system into two subsystems with  @xmath1 and  @xmath14 particles the corresponding bipartite entropy is the quantum entropy of the reduced density matrix  @xmath15 , where  @xmath16 and the trace is taken over the degrees of freedom of the latter subsystem .",
    "this definition is actually symmetric between both subsystems , since the entropy of  @xmath17 necessarily coincides with that of  @xmath18 . in practice ,",
    "the von neumann  @xcite and rnyi  @xcite entropies , respectively defined by @xmath19 ( where @xmath8 is a positive real parameter ) have been extensively used as quantitative measures of the bipartite entanglement .",
    "the exact evaluation of these entropies , or even the determination of their large @xmath1 limit , is only possible for a handful of mostly one - dimensional models .",
    "these models include the xx and xy nearest - neighbors heisenberg spin chains , for which the asymptotic behavior of both the von neumann and rnyi entropies was established in the last decade  @xcite with the help of the fisher  hartwig conjecture .",
    "as is well known , both of these models are critical in a certain region of their parameter space  @xcite .",
    "the large  @xmath1 behavior of the entropy is essentially different in the critical and non - critical regions .",
    "more precisely , the entropy scales as @xmath20 in the critical region , while it saturates to a constant in the non - critical one .",
    "this is a manifestation of the so - called area law  @xcite , according to which the ( von neumann ) bipartite entropy of a critical one - dimensional quantum system with short - range interactions behaves as @xmath20 , while for non - critical systems it tends to a constant .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the bipartite entropy of two - dimensional conformal field theories ( which describe one - dimensional quantum critical systems in the thermodynamic limit ) scales as @xmath21 , where  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 denote respectively the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic central charges and  @xmath24 for the von neumann entropy  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it is generally believed that the area law need not hold for systems exhibiting long - range interactions , since the stronger correlations in these systems are expected to increase the entropy .",
    "one of the few one - dimensional long - range quantum systems that has been exactly solved is the lipkin  meshkov  glick ( lmg ) model  @xcite , originally introduced by the latter authors to describe a system of @xmath25 fermions in two levels",
    "each of which is @xmath25 times degenerate .",
    "this model is equivalent to a system of @xmath25 spin @xmath26 particles with constant xy - type long - range interactions in a transverse magnetic field . in the isotropic ( xx )",
    "case the model is exactly solvable , and its bipartite von neumann entropy has also been computed in closed form  @xcite .",
    "the von neumann entropy vanishes in the gapped ( and not entangled ) phase , while it grows as @xmath27 in the gapless one .",
    "thus the lmg model behaves in this respect as a one - dimensional quantum system with _",
    "short_-range interactions .",
    "the reason of this behavior is the competition between the range of the interactions , which tends to increase the entropy , and the high degree of symmetry of this model , which tends to lower it .",
    "indeed , in this case the ground state is a symmetric dicke state ( i.e. , it has maximum total spin @xmath28 and a well - defined value of the total spin component  @xmath29 ) for all values of its parameters , which is easily seen to imply that the entanglement entropy can not exceed  @xmath30 .",
    "a class of one - dimensional models with long - range interactions which has been extensively studied is that of spin chains of haldane  shastry ( hs ) type .",
    "the original  hs chain  @xcite is a lattice model of @xmath25 spin  @xmath26 particles uniformly arranged on a circle , with pairwise interactions inversely proportional to the square of the chord distance .",
    "this model was soon afterwards generalized to particles carrying @xmath0 spin , as well as to rational and hyperbolic interactions  @xcite .",
    "the hs chain , which is closely related to the one - dimensional hubbard model with long - range hopping  @xcite , is exactly solvable via the asymptotic bethe ansatz , and its partition function can be evaluated in closed form  @xcite . among other remarkable properties ,",
    "the hs chain possesses exact yangian symmetry for a finite number of sites  @xcite , and provides one of the simplest realizations of anyons in one dimension via haldane s fractional statistics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall introduce a large family of @xmath0 spin chains which , like the hs - type chains , feature variable long - range interactions , and whose ground state entanglement properties are similar to those of the isotropic lmg model . more precisely , the models we shall construct will admit as non - degenerate ground state a generalized dicke state of  @xmath0 type , i.e. , a state totally symmetric under permutations and with a well defined number of particles in each of the  @xmath0 internal one - particle states ( @xmath0 magnons ) .",
    "this will be achieved by replacing the quadratic term in the total spin operator @xmath29 present in the  lmg hamiltonian by a sum of similar terms in each of the generators of the  @xmath0 cartan subalgebra .",
    "the resulting models can thus be considered a natural generalization of the original ( isotropic ) lmg model , to which they actually reduce when @xmath31 and all the two - body interactions are constant .",
    "an explicit expression for the reduced density matrix  @xmath17 of any system whose ground state is an @xmath0-type dicke state with arbitrary @xmath32 first appeared in ref .",
    "the eigenvalues of  @xmath17 turn out to define a hypergeometric distribution in @xmath32 variables , thus generalizing the result of refs .",
    "@xcite for the spin @xmath26 ( @xmath31 ) isotropic lmg model .",
    "we shall show that in the thermodynamic limit  @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( finite ) the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix can be well approximated by a gaussian distribution , whose parameters we evaluate in closed form for arbitrary  @xmath32 and  @xmath35 . with the help of this approximation",
    ", we obtain explicit asymptotic expressions for the von neumann and rnyi entropies in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in particular , our expression for the von neumann entropy coincides with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , derived by extrapolation from the  @xmath36 case . remarkably , in the region of parameter space for which all the ground state magnon densities are non - vanishing both of these entropies scale as @xmath37 as  @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "thus the behavior of the von neumann entropy is that of a critical model with  @xmath38 , described by a conformal field theory ( cft ) with  @xmath32 fermions and @xmath32 bosons .",
    "this may not seem surprising at first sight , taking into account that many critical one - dimensional spin chains , including the heisenberg ( xxx ) and the  @xmath0  hs chains , are effectively described by theories of this type  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here , however , the situation is more subtle .",
    "indeed , the rnyi entropy  @xmath7 , although still proportional to  @xmath20 for large  @xmath1 , becomes independent of the parameter  @xmath8 for  @xmath6 , and as a consequence the family of generalized isotropic lmg models can not contain any critical instances .",
    "it is well known that a crucial requirement of classical thermodynamics is the extensivity of the ( maxwell  boltzmann ) entropy of a given system , i.e. , that @xmath39 , where @xmath1 is a characteristic length of the system and @xmath40 is the number of space dimensions . in a quantum context",
    "this requirement , at least for the von neumann entropy , is violated in many cases , as for instance in black hole thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the area law mentioned above evidences a non - extensive behavior of von neumann s entropy in strongly correlated quantum systems . on the other hand",
    ", it is very natural to enquire whether this feature is shared by all quantum entropies available in the literature .",
    "interestingly enough , this is not the case .",
    "for instance , as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum tsallis entropy  @xcite can be extensive when von neumann s is not in several one- and two - dimensional strongly correlated systems , which include the heisenberg  xy model .",
    "we have found a similar behavior for the tsallis entanglement entropy of the ground state of generalized @xmath0 lmg models with @xmath9 ( where @xmath5 is the number of vanishing magnon densities ) , while for @xmath41 the tsallis entropy is not extensive for any value of its parameter .",
    "as mentioned above , the ground state of the isotropic lmg model has two quantum phases ( entangled and non - entangled ) , respectively determined by the values of the ( suitably normalized ) magnetic field strength being less or greater than @xmath42 in absolute value . for the generalized lmg models constructed in this paper , the situation is more subtle .",
    "more precisely , we shall show that in this case the ground state can be in exactly @xmath43 quantum phases , each of which is characterized by the vanishing of a certain number of magnon densities .",
    "moreover , in the phase with @xmath5 vanishing magnon densities both the von neumann and rnyi entropies scale as  @xmath44 , implying again that none of these phases can contain any critical models .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the ground state phases in the @xmath10 ( @xmath45 ) case , completely identifying the corresponding regions in parameter space .",
    "remarkably , these regions are entirely determined in a geometric way by the weights of the fundamental representation of  @xmath10 associated to the choice of the cartan generators .",
    "a similar result holds in the general ( @xmath0 ) case ; for instance , we show that the region for which all the magnon densities are non - vanishing is an @xmath11-simplex in  @xmath12 whose vertices are the weights of the fundamental representation of @xmath0 .",
    "we end this section with a few words on the paper s organization . in section  [ sec.lmg ]",
    "we review the main properties of the isotropic lmg model and present the construction of its  @xmath0 generalization with non - constant interactions . in section  [ sec.entropies ]",
    "we evaluate in closed form the ground state entanglement entropies of von neumann and rnyi , and study their main properties . as a byproduct of our analysis , we obtain a similar expression for the tsallis entropy and discuss its extensivity . in section  [ sec.gspd ] , a detailed description of the entanglement properties of the ground state as a function of the @xmath0 magnetic field strength is presented .",
    "special attention is paid to the case @xmath45 , for which we obtain a complete phase diagram describing the regions in parameter space with different magnon content .",
    "section  [ sec.conc ] is devoted to the presentation of our conclusions and the discussion of some open problems suggested by the previous results .",
    "the paper ends with three technical appendices in which we present a detailed derivation of the exact formula for the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , compute the first and second moments of a multivariate hypergeometric distribution , and show how a univariate hypergeometric distribution can be approximated by a normal one in a suitable limit .",
    "the original lipkin  meshkov  glick model describes a system of @xmath25 mutually interacting spin 1/2 particles in a constant magnetic field .",
    "its hamiltonian can be taken as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real parameters , @xmath50 is the @xmath3-th pauli matrix acting on the @xmath5-th spin , and the sums ( as hereafter , unless otherwise stated ) range from @xmath42 to @xmath25 .",
    "the model   is thus the analogue of the heisenberg  xy chain with long - range constant interactions .",

    "we shall focus on the isotropic case  @xmath57 , for which @xmath58 is diagonal in a basis @xmath59 of common eigenstates , which ranges from @xmath42 to @xmath60 , takes into account the degeneracy of the eigenspace with a given  @xmath61 and  @xmath62 .",

    "thus the problem of minimizing  @xmath359 is again equivalent to finding the distance ( with respect to the norm  @xmath404 ) of the fixed vector  @xmath266 to the simplex  @xmath267 .",
    "since this simplex is a convex polytope , there is a unique point in  @xmath267 closest to  @xmath266 for all values of  @xmath406 .",
    "this proves that the magnon densities are uniquely determined by the magnetic field strength  @xmath266 , so that the ground state of the glmg model   is always unique .",
    "more precisely , when  @xmath361 , the distance of  @xmath266 to  @xmath267 is obviously zero and the corresponding density vector  @xmath372 is again determined by the condition  @xmath407 , i.e. , by eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , when  @xmath266 lies outside  @xmath387 ( in particular , if  @xmath364 ) , it is clear from geometric considerations that the minimum distance of  @xmath266 to the simplex  @xmath267 is attained at a point  @xmath408 , so that the corresponding magnon density  @xmath372 lies in  @xmath319 .",
    "hence in the latter case the system is in one of the @xmath32 phases characterized by the vanishing of  @xmath409 magnon densities .",
    "in this work we have introduced a large class of @xmath0 spin models with long - range interactions possessing a symmetric non - degenerate ground state with well - defined magnon numbers .",
    "our models provide a natural multiparameter generalization of the well - known spin  @xmath26 isotropic lipkin  meshkov  glick model , featuring non - constant interactions and  @xmath0 spin .",
    "they are also closely related to haldane  shastry type chains , which can be formally obtained from them through specific realizations of the couplings @xmath166 dropping the magnetic field terms .",
    "one of the main results of our work is the detailed derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of a block of @xmath1 spins when the system is in its ground state , for arbitrary values of @xmath32 and @xmath410 .",
    "this makes it possible to compute the von neumann and rnyi entropies in closed form when  @xmath253 , and to derive their asymptotic behavior when  @xmath6 .",
    "a notable outcome of our analysis is that both of these entropies scale as  @xmath44 in the latter limit , where @xmath5 is the number of vanishing magnon densities in the ground state . in particular , from the behavior of the rnyi entropy it follows that the class of generalized  @xmath0 lmg models contains no critical models .",
    "we have also computed the tsallis entropy , showing that it can be made extensive when the number of `` effective '' internal degrees of freedom  @xmath411 is greater than @xmath412 .",
    "finally , we have completely determined the different phases of the ground state in terms of the  @xmath0 magnetic field strength  @xmath266 , and shown that they are related in a simple geometric way to the weights of the fundamental representation of  @xmath0 .",
    "our results open up several natural directions for further research and a number of related problems .",
    "one such problem is the determination in closed form of the full spectrum of suitable models of the class introduced in this paper , particularly for  @xmath0 spin with  @xmath413 .",
    "in fact , the integrability properties of the hs - type chains suggest the possibility of exploring the existence of integrable generalizations thereof with a non - vanishing magnetic field term of the form considered in this work . at the same time",
    ", it could also be of interest to extend the analysis of the entanglement entropy performed in this paper to different entropic functionals . indeed , due to the presence of several parameters in the glmg hamiltonian",
    ", multiparametric entropies  @xcite could play an important role in the classification of the possible thermodynamic regimes admitted by the system when one varies the values of its parameters .",
    "finally , the fact that the von neumann entanglement entropy of generalized lmg models is proportional to  @xmath20 in certain regions of parameter space , though as we have seen does not imply the existence of critical models , suggests that these regions may nevertheless contain models with interesting non - generic properties worth investigating .",
    "this is certainly true in the  @xmath31 case , since ( for instance ) the isotropic lmg model is gapless precisely in the interval  @xmath414 for which the von neumann entropy scales as  @xmath20  @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we shall compute from first principles the reduced density matrix  @xmath17 of a block of @xmath1 spins of the  @xmath0 glmg chain   when the system is in its ground state  , with magnon densities  @xmath415 determined ( in the thermodynamic limit ) by eq .  .",
    "this result , first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , shall be used in section  [ sec.entropies ] to evaluate several standard bipartite entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more precisely , we need to compute @xmath416 where @xmath417 is the trace over the degrees of freedom of the remaining @xmath14 spins .",
    "since the ground state  @xmath144 is invariant under permutations , the result is obviously independent of the specific positions of the  @xmath1 spins considered .",
    "we shall therefore assume in what follows that the two blocks under consideration consist of the first @xmath1 and the last @xmath14 spins . in order to evaluate the rhs of eq .  , it is convenient to label the states of the canonical spin basis  @xmath418 by the positions of its magnons .",
    "more explicitly , we shall use the notation @xmath419 to denote a state whose type  @xmath3 magnons ( with @xmath122 ) are located in the positions specified by the @xmath420 components of the ordered multi - index @xmath421 , while those of type  @xmath43 lie in the remaining positions .",
    "note , in particular , that no two multi - indices @xmath421 and @xmath422 with @xmath130 can have any common components , which we shall denote by  @xmath423 .",
    "for instance , with this notation the  @xmath424 basis state @xmath425 will be denoted by @xmath426 .    using the above notation",

    "we thus have @xmath429 where the sum is again over all ordered multi - indices  @xmath421 , @xmath430 satisfying the above condition .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate  @xmath17 we need only compute  @xmath431 . to this end , we decompose each multi - index  @xmath421 as @xmath432 where the components of each  @xmath433 range from  @xmath42 to @xmath1 and those of @xmath434 from @xmath435 to @xmath25 , and similarly for  @xmath430 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath436 indeed , @xmath437 unless the last @xmath14 spin components of the basis states represented by  @xmath419 and @xmath438 are both equal to @xmath439 , which accounts for the product of kronecker deltas in eq .  .",
    "moreover , when  @xmath440 for all  @xmath122 the only state of the canonical basis of the hilbert space of the last @xmath14 spins that can contribute to the trace is  @xmath441 , which immediately yields eq .  .",
    "using eq .",

    ".   reduces to @xmath453 using eq .   with @xmath25 and @xmath420 respectively replaced by @xmath1 and @xmath199",
