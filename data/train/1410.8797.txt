    "two way relaying communications have recently attracted considerable attentions due to their various applications . in this communication scenario ,",
    "two users attempt to communicate with each other with the help of a relay . to this end ,",
    "physical layer network coding ( plnc ) [ 1 ] along with the conventional decode - and - forward ( df ) or amplify - and - forward ( af ) relaying strategies has been commonly employed [ 2 - 4 ] to improve the system throughput [ 5 ] .    a novel relaying technique , known as compute - and - forward ( cmf ) [ 6 ] , has been designed for multi users applications with the aim of increasing the physical layer network coding throughput . in this scheme ,",
    "each relay , based on a received noisy combination of simultaneously transmitted signals of the users , attempts to recover an equation , i.e. , a linear integer - combination , of users messages , instead of recovering each individual message separately . to enable the relay to recover the equation ,",
    "the cmf scheme is usually implemented based on using a proper lattice code [ 7 ] . since the equation coefficients are selected according to the channel coefficients , this method is also called physical layer network coding [ 8 ] .",
    "the relay then transmits the decoded equation to the destination .",
    "the destination recovers the desired messages by receiving enough number of decoded equations from the relays .",
    "in fact , in contrast to conventional af and df relaying techniques , the cmf method exploits rather than combats the interference towards a better network performance . by applying cmf in point - to - point mimo systems , a linear receiver , named as integer forcing linear receiver ( iflr ) has been proposed in [ 9 ] in which sufficient independent equations with maximum rate are recovered to extract the users messages .",
    "since the number of wireless communication users will continuously increase , independently designed one - pair two - way relay systems can scarcely accommodate a vast number of users .",
    "that is , with simultaneously transmission of pairs of users , the messages interfere with each other , and hence , arbitrary transmission and reception of the messages are not an efficient solution . to solve the problem , in [ 10 - 12 ] ,",
    "centralized designed mimo multi - pair two - way transmission schemes with the help of a multi antenna relay have been proposed . in [ 10 - 11 ] , the af method has been utilized in the relay .",
    "that is , the relay simply amplifies and forwards the received signal . in",
    "[ 12 ] , the df relaying is used , as a scheme named denoise - and - forward , in which the relay after applying projection filter , first decodes each pair signal aligned messages individually and then precodes and transmits the decoded messages .",
    "the design criteria for precoder and projection filters in [ 10 - 12 ] is the minimization of the sum of the users mean squared errors ( sum mse ) . in [ 10 ] , the maximization of the users mean squared errors ( max mse ) is also considered for the transeiver design . in the simple case of single antenna one - pair two - way relay system , we have applied cmf by introducing the aligned compute - and - forward ( a - cmf ) scheme [ 13 ] which outperforms af and df based schemes significantly .      in this paper",
    ", we consider a more general case of two - way communications that involves multiple pairs of multiple - antenna source nodes with considering both multiple - access and broadcast phases .",
    "we propose a new transmission scheme named integer forcing - and - forward ( iff ) .",
    "we exploit the signal alignment proposed in [ 14 - 15 ] such that the two signals received from two users in a pair can be network coded together in the relay .",
    "furthermore , we apply iflr to harness the inter - pair interference in terms of equations .",
    "in the proposed scheme , the equations are decoded with higher rate than individual messages in the relay .",
    "in addition , after transmitting all recovered equations to the users , different ways to select the equations that each user needs to recover its pair s message can be utilized .",
    "therefore , our scheme has two superiorities in comparison with the df based scheme in [ 12 ] , in which each pair message is recovered for the transmission to the respective user .      in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the precoder at transmitting nodes , including the users and the relay , and the projection filter at receiving nodes are designed based on minimizing the mse criteria .",
    "_ for the first time _",
    ", we introduce the sum of the equations mean squared errors ( sum - equation mse ) and the maximum of the equations mean squared errors ( max - equation mse ) criteria for the equation recovery problem associated with the multiple - access phase precoding and filter design . these proposed equation based mse algorithms",
    "are proven to be convergent .",
    "moreover , we use traditional mse criteria , i.e. sum mse and max mse , proposed for the individual message recovery , for the broadcast phase precoding and filter design . by means of alternating optimization approach , we present tractable solutions for these mse problems . we evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme and compare the results with those of the previous methods .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms the previous methods in terms of the outage probability and the network throughput . in addition",
    ", the max based mse precoding design , using max - equation mse in multiple - access phase and max mse in broadcast phase , shows a better performance than sum based mse precoding design , using sum - equation mse and sum mse , at the expense of more complexity .",
    "we extend our proposed schemes for the case of imperfect channel state information ( imperfect csi ) . at first , we propose modified iflr , taking to account the effect of channel estimation errors in the conventional iflr receiver structure .",
    "then , accordingly , a robust transceiver design is proposed .",
    "simulation results show that the robust design improves the performance of the non - robust design , based on assuming the exact knowledge of csi at the presence of the channel estimation error .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and the integer forcing - and - forward scheme are briefly described .",

    "for example , in sum rate of 7 bit / channel use , the proposed scheme has 1.5 db improvement in comparison with the best conventional relaying scheme .",
    "moreover , the max based mse design outperforms the sum based mse transceiver .",
    "the results of fig . 4 and 5 demonstrate that the use of the interference in terms of equations has significant superiority than when the interference is considered as an additional noise , like in the conventional af and df schemes .    in fig 6 , the effect of the number of antennas @xmath165 , i.e. @xmath207 , on the performance of the system is assessed .",
    "as can be observed and expected , the sum rate of the proposed scheme increases by higher @xmath165 .",
    "for example , in sum rate of 5 bit / channel use , the system with @xmath208 performs 4.5 db better than the one with @xmath209 .    in fig .",
    "7 , we investigate the effect of channel estimation errors on the performance of the system with @xmath206 , where the error power is @xmath210 .",
    "the plots are provided for two precoder and filter designs , the non - robust design neglecting the presence of csi error , and the robust design .",
    "as expected , the robust design has a better performance than the non - robust design , and the improvement becomes more by increasing the error power .",
    "for instance , when error power is 0.1 , the robust design performs 2 db better in sum rate of 5 bit / channel use , and at error power 0.4 , about 4 db better in sum rate of 4 bit / channel use .",
    "also , as can be observed , as the error power goes up , the performance is degraded even in the robust design case .",
    "for example in sum rate of 6 bit / channel use , the design with perfect csi has 2.5 db better performance in comparison with the robust design when there is an imperfect csi with error power 0.1 , and the robust design with error power 0.1 performs significantly better than the one with error power 0.4 . in addition , the max based mse design performs better in different error powers .",

    "we designed the precoder and projection matrices using the proposed equation based mse critera , i.e. sum - equation mse and max - equation mse in the multiple - access phase , and conventional user based mse critera , i.e. sum mse and max mse in the broadcast phase .",
    "we also derived the precoder and filters design at the presence of csi error .",
    "we have introduced modified integer forcing linear receiver to overcome the channel estimation error efficiently . for the schemes , we have proposed algorithms in which the alternative method is applied , and thus , the optimum solution can be achieved . the proposed scheme shows a significantly better performance , in terms of the sum rate and the outage probability , in comparison with conventional designs . moreover , in the case of imperfect csi , the proposed robust transceiver design improves the system performance compared with the non - robust design , in which the effect of channel estimation error is neglected .",
    "with expanding , we have @xmath211 since @xmath158 and @xmath159 , this leads to @xmath212 on the other hand , for any random vector @xmath213 with mean @xmath214 and covariance @xmath215 , and an matrix @xmath7 , we have [ 17 ] : @xmath216 from ( 88 ) and the fact that @xmath146 and @xmath156 , we have @xmath217 and therefore , this leads to @xmath218 so , the theorem is proved .",
    "from ( 62 ) , the optimum value of @xmath60 is obtained by minimizing the following function : @xmath219 the optimum value of @xmath60 is the solution of @xmath220 hence , @xmath221 thus , the theorem is proved .    1 s. zhang , s.c .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a new transmission scheme , named as integer forcing - and - forward ( iff ) , for communications among multi - pair multiple - antenna users in which each pair exchanges their messages with the help of a single multi antennas relay in the multiple - access and broadcast phases . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme utilizes integer forcing linear receiver ( iflr ) at relay , which uses equations , i.e. , linear integer - combinations of messages , to harness the intra - pair interference . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we propose the design of mean squared error ( mse ) based transceiver , including precoder and projection matrices for the relay and users , assuming that the perfect channel state information ( csi ) is available . in this regards , in the multiple - access phase , we introduce two new mse criteria for the related precoding and filter designs , i.e. , the sum of the equations mse ( sum - equation mse ) and the maximum of the equations mse ( max - equation mse ) , to exploit the equations in the relay . in addition , the convergence of the proposed criteria is proven as well . moreover , in the broadcast phase , we use the two traditional mse criteria , i.e. the sum of the users mean squred errors ( sum mse ) and the maximum of the users mean squared errors ( max mse ) , to design the related precoding and filters for recovering relay s equations by the users . </S>",
    "<S> then , we consider a more practical scenario with imperfect csi . for this case , iflr receiver </S>",
    "<S> is modified , and another transceiver design is proposed , which take into account the effect of channels estimation error . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the performance of our proposed strategy and compare the results with the conventional amplify - and - forward ( af ) and denoise - and - forward ( df ) strategies for the same scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate the substantial superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of the outage probability and the sum rate . </S>"
