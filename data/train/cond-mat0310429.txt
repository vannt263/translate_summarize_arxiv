    "in the last decade , there has been increasing interest in investigating interference phenomena of electronic motion in ballistic quantum dots @xcite . in semiconductor quantum dots",
    "the confining potential has the length scale much larger than the fermi wavelength , and therefore one may expect that electron motion in such systems may be described by methods of classical trajectories . typically , the classical electron motion inside dots is chaotic .",
    "an important question is , what happens to the energy spectrum .",
    "it turns out that the energy spectrum of a single electron in chaotic quantum dots is highly sensitive to the parameters of the system ( e.g. , fermi momentum , the strength of the applied magnetic field , the impurity configuration , the shape of the boundary of ballistic quantum dots , etc . ) .",
    "substantial progress has been made by studying the statistics of energy levels .",
    "the level statistics has played an important role in the theories of atomic nuclei@xcite , disordered metals@xcite , and quantum chaos@xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting quantity in the level statistics is the so - called two level correlation function , @xmath0 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mean level spacing and @xmath9 is the hamiltonian . @xmath10 denotes the average over a wide energy band ( for individual quantum dots ) or the impurity configuration ( for quantum disorders ) .    in his pioneering work ,",
    "dyson divided the hamiltonian matrices into three classes : gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) and gaussian sympletic ensemble ( gse ) and used the random matrix theory ( rmt ) to find that @xmath0 follows different universal behavior for these ensembles @xcite . gorkov and",
    "eliashberg were the first to use wigner - dyson ensemble to study transport properties in small metallic grains@xcite .",
    "for disordered metals , the behavior of @xmath0 is now well understood . for grains in the presence of a lot of quantum ( born )",
    "impurities , theoretical justification of the universal rmt result came up with the supersymmetric field theory due to efetov @xcite , assuming that @xmath11 is much smaller than the thouless energy @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the diffusion constant and @xmath14 the size of the grain .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 beyond @xmath15 is nonuniversal @xcite .",
    "that is , the level statistics at @xmath16 is system - dependent . in ref .",

    "recently , the weak localization correction to @xmath0 beyond the thouless energy @xmath15 was studied in ref .   with the help of replica technique @xcite .",
    "bohigas , giagonni , and schmit ( bgs ) proposed a conjecture that the fluctuations of levels of quantum chaotic systems may follow the universal rmt results @xcite .",
    "one routine method to study the behavior of @xmath0 in ballistic quantum dots is to employ the gutzwiller formula @xcite .",
    "a cornerstone was put by berry @xcite . by taking into account the diagonal contributions",

    "proceeding along this line , an important progress was made in ref .  , where the off - diagonal contributions were studied and the oscillation similar to the universal rmt results was thereby found .    in this paper , we will study the ballistic quantum dot with weak diffractions , where the classical electronic motion is chaotic ( chaotic quantum dots ) .",
    "in such case , there is a new scale @xmath2 , so - called ehrenfest time , which has logarithmic dependence on @xmath18 : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the lyapunov exponent , @xmath14 is some macroscopic size and @xmath21 is the fermi wavelength .",

    "the manifestation of @xmath2 in the level statistics of chaotic quantum dots was first studied in ref .  .",
    "according to the rmt , asymptotically , for large @xmath11 the two level correlation function consists of two parts : one part is perturbative in @xmath31 .",
