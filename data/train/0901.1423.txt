    "however , well - known types of sliding density waves such as the charge - density wave and the collinear spin - density - wave can not easily be observed because the internal phase modulation does not carry directly measured quantity.@xcite another example is the charge and spin soliton transport in conjugated polymers where the double degeneracy of ground state configurations gives rise to diffusive solitons.@xcite in this paper , we demonstrate a new possibility to create an isolated magnetic soliton over the topological ground state configuration in chiral helimagnet with the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moryia ( dm ) exchange and the strong easy - plane anisotropy . we show that the isolated magnetic soliton exists and it can carry the observable magnetic density .",
    "helimagnetic structures are stabilized by either frustration among exchange couplings@xcite or the dm relativistic exchange.@xcite in the latter case , an absence of the rotoinversion symmetry in chiral crystals causes the lifshitz invariant in the landau free energy .",

    "the ground state and linear excitations of the chiral helimagnet under an applied magnetic field have been a subject of extensive studies from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints.@xcite concerning nonlinear excitations in this class of spiral systems , the solitonic excitations were studied in the case of _ easy - axis _ anisotropy.@xcite it has been revealed that the first simplest soliton solution in the easy - axis helimagnet presents a helical domain wall , a nucleation of a helical phase , whereas the second solution , so - called a wave of rotation , describes a localized change of the phase with a finite velocity , which is accompanied by a coming of moments out of the basal plane ( fig .",

    "the correspondence reached by a gauge transformation enables to use a well established classification of nonlinear excitations in the last system.@xcite however , the theoretical tool turns out to be inappropriate to be applied to the helimagnet with the lifshitz invariant an the easy - plane anisotropy because the axial symmetry is lost in this case .    in this paper , we show that this problem is resolved with the bcklund transformation ( bt ) technique.@xcite the method we use has been effectively applied to studies of topological vortex - type singular solutions of the elliptic sine - gordon ( sg ) equation.@xcite in particular , one- and two - dimensional vortex lattices on both a homogeneous and periodic backgrounds have been constructed using the bcklund transformation.@xcite one of the main findings of our investigation is an appearance of a non - trivial traveling soliton which carries a localized magnon density .",
