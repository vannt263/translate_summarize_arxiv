    "the analysis of resistance fluctuations has proved to be a very powerful tool for probing various condensed matter systems @xcite , including nanostructures @xcite and disordered materials , like conductor - insulator composites @xcite , granular systems @xcite , porous @xcite or amorphous materials @xcite , organic conducting blends @xcite .",
    "therefore , many experimental and theoretical investigations have been devoted to study the resistance noise as a function of temperature , bias strength and of the main material properties @xcite .",
    "one of the most relevant features of the resistance noise lies in its dependence on frequency .",
    "many condensed matter systems display the so called lorentzian noise @xcite , which is characterized by a power spectral density of the resistance fluctuations scaling as @xmath5 at high frequencies and becoming flat below a corner frequency @xmath6 . a behavior associated in the time domain with an exponential decay of the correlations and thus with a well defined characteristic time , @xmath7 ( correlation time ) @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it is well known @xcite that many other condensed matter systems exhibit @xmath8 resistance noise , i.e. a spectral density scaling at low frequencies as @xmath0 with @xmath9 , thus a noise associated with a non - exponential decay of the correlations in the time domain .",
    "the ubiquitous presence of @xmath8 noise in a large variety of phenomena of very different nature has given rise to many attempts to explain it in terms of a universal law @xcite . moreover",
    "the link between @xmath8 noise and extreme value statistics has been also investigated @xcite .",
    "a simple way to obtain an @xmath8 spectrum is by superimposing a large number of lorentzian spectra with an appropriate distribution of the correlation times @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "this distribution can be derived from the distribution of some variable on which the correlation times themselves depend , as in the case of the pioneering works of mc whorter @xcite and dutta et al .",
    "in particular , these authors proposed @xcite that the origin of the @xmath8 noise could be attributed to a thermally activated expression of the correlation times , associated with a broad distribution of the corresponding activation energies , an assumption physically plausible for many systems @xcite .    in the last twenty years , many other important contributions have advanced the understanding of the @xmath8 noise showing that the presence of an @xmath8 spectrum can also arise from other basic reasons @xcite .",
    "thus , the conclusion , now largely accepted in the literature @xcite , is that a unique , universal origin of @xmath8 does not exist , even though classes of systems can share a common basic origin of @xmath8 noise .",
    "for example , spin - glass models @xcite provide a good explanation of the @xmath8 noise in conducting random magnetic materials .",
    "dissipative self - organised criticality ( soc ) models @xcite clarify the origin of @xmath8 spectra in certain dissipative dynamical systems naturally evolving into a critical state .",
    "avalanche models @xcite , clustering models @xcite and percolative models @xcite represent other relevant classes of theoretical approaches explaining the appearence of @xmath8 noise in a variety of systems .",
    "in particular , the use of random resistor network ( rrn ) models @xcite has proved to be very fruitful . within this approach",
    ", a large attention has been devoted to the calculation of the noise exponents in two - components rrn , as for example in refs . .",
    "however these authors assumed the existence _ a priori _ of independent @xmath8 microscopic fluctuators , associated with small fluctuations of the local resistivity , and they studied the influence of the topology and disorder of the network on the resistance noise magnitude at a fixed frequency .",
    "the existence of microscopic lorentzian fluctuators giving rise to @xmath8 noise at a macroscopic level , has been proposed instead by gingl et al . @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of small local fluctuations has been released by seidler et al .",
    "@xcite , who have shown that when the local resistivity fluctuations are large , the dynamical redistribution of the current gives rise to long - range ( space ) correlations and non - gaussian @xmath8 noise .",
    "finally , another important class of @xmath8 rrn models is represented by dynamical percolation models @xcite , introduced by lust and kakalios for describing lorentzian spectra @xcite and then modified to account for @xmath8 noise @xcite . within these models ,",
    "@xmath8 noise arises from random jumps performed by some elemental component of the system between two states ( like trapping and detrapping of charge carriers @xcite , or on and off states in the switcher model @xcite ) .",
    "precisely , lust and kakalios considered a two - dimensional rrn with half of the resistors removed at random ( percolation threshold ) . by focusing on the filamentary resistive structures connecting the electrodes , they allowed fluctuations only for the resistors at the nearest neighbor positions @xcite . in this manner",
    ", a uniform distribution of the trapping times provides a lorentzian spectrum @xcite , while a certain non uniform distribution of these times gives rise to an @xmath8 noise spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , celasco and eggenhffner @xcite have studied a binary rrn with links behaving as random switchers of resistances @xmath10 , fluctuating bewteen two on and off states ( associated with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) .",
    "the time evolution of a single switcher is controlled by two parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively representing the probability for a switcher to be on at the time @xmath15 and the probability for the same switcher to be off at @xmath16 if it was on at @xmath15 .",
    "this model applies only to linear systems and it does not contain any direct link with the external conditions , however its nice and nearly unique feature is that it provides a resistance noise with power spectrum @xmath0 with @xmath17 depending on the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "actually , many experiments report about @xmath1 ranging between @xmath18 in the same system depending on the external conditions @xcite . in particular , at high external biases , transitions from @xmath8 to lorentzian noise are observed in many systems , as a consequence of the suppression of the plurality of characteristic times induced by extreme , far from equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a new model able to describe within a unified framework both lorentzian and @xmath8 noises , together with the transitions between these two kinds of spectra @xcite .",
    "thus , by connecting the differences in the power spectral density not only with the parameters intrinsic to a given system but also with the different external conditions : ranging from nearly equilibrium conditions ( very low biases ) , to non - equilibrium stationary states , up to failure conditions .",
    "correspondingly , in the time domain this means to tune the decay of correlations from a long - term decay ( power - law scaling of the two - points auto - correlation function ) up to an exponential decay .    the model that we propose belongs to the dynamical percolation class @xcite .",
    "precisely , we consider a network made by several species of resistors , where each species is characterized by the values of the elementary resistance , of the temperature coefficient and of two activation energies , which control the probabilities of breaking and recovery processes of that species .",
    "for this reason we call this model `` multi - species network '' ( msn ) model . the states , either stationary or non - stationary , of the msn result from the stochastic competition between the breaking and recovery processes of the different species . in analogy with dutta et",
    "@xcite , we take the activation energies distributed in a broad range of values , as discussed in the next section . as a consequence , the resistance fluctuations of the msn exhibit an @xmath19 power spectrum , where the value of @xmath1 in the range @xmath18 depends on temperature and current .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we illustrate the msn model , in sect .",
    "iii we report the results and finally in sect .",
    "iv we draw the conclusions of this study .",
    "the multi - species network can be considered as a generalization of the single species network ( ssn ) @xcite .",
    "the ssn model describes a rn whose resistance fluctuates over a single time - scale .",
    "in such a network the correlations relax exponentially ( with small deviations from a single exponential decay at high biases ) and the power spectral density of the resistance fluctuations is lorentzian - like ( @xmath20 ) at all temperatures and currents @xcite , as will be discussed in the following . both the models , msn and ssn , share some technical features that the reader can found with more details in refs .",
    "@xcite .    as usual for rrn models",
    "@xcite , a conducting thin film with granular structure is described as a two - dimensional @xmath21 resistor network with square - lattice , where @xmath22 is the linear size of the network @xcite .",
    "the rn is biased by an external constant current , @xmath23 , applied through perfectly conducting bars placed at the left and right hand sides and it is in contact with a thermal bath at a temperature @xmath24 . in the msn model proposed here the network",
    "is made by @xmath25 different species of resistors , whose resistances are denoted by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the index of the elementary resistor specifying its position within the network and @xmath28 labels the species .",
    "the elementary resistances are taken linearly dependent on temperature : @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 are respectively the resistance at the thermal bath temperature and the temperature coefficient of the @xmath32-th species , while @xmath33 is the local temperature . by neglecting time dependent effects in the heat diffusion",
    "@xcite we account for the local joule heating of the n-_th _ resistor and its neighbors by expressing the local temperature as @xcite : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 describes the heat coupling of the elementary resistor with the thermal bath and @xmath36 depends on the local currents @xcite .",
    "each resistor can be in two states : regular ( with resistance @xmath26 ) or broken ( with resistance @xmath37 ) .",
    "resistors in the broken state are called defects .",
    "the transition from the two states is stochastic : the transition from the regular state to the broken one ( breaking process ) occurs with probability @xmath38 while the reverse transition ( recovery process ) occurs with probability @xmath39 , where @xmath32 is the species index defined above .",
    "both processes are thermally activated , thus their probabilities are : @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the activation energies of the @xmath32-species and @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the initial state of the network ( equal or different fraction of each species , ordered or randomly distributed within the network , values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) has an important role on the network evolution : thus both on the actual achievement of stationary states and on the features of the resistance fluctuations .",
    "the initial conditions that we have considered in this work are the following .",
    "\\i ) we have taken the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 uniformly distributed inside a given range of values : respectively @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this choice has been adopted for the sake of simplicity , while other options are reasonable as well .",
    "\\ii ) we have assumed a random distribution of the species within the network . though special patterns for the space distribution of the species within the network can be of interest in many situations , the choice adopted here is the simplest one .",
    "\\iii ) we have taken the activation energies @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the different species uniformly distributed inside the ranges of values @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "this choice , taken in analogy with dutta et al .",
    "@xcite , is physically justified in many disordered systems , like granular and amorphous materials , composites , etc .",
    ", where the orientational disorder present inside these materials can give rise to different energy barriers for the electron flow along the different conducting paths @xcite .",
    "\\vi ) the energies , @xmath42 , @xmath43 have been coupled by imposing the condition that the difference @xmath49 is approximately the same for the different species : @xmath50 .",
    "the reasons of this assumption will be explained below .",
    "however , we anticipate that by defining @xmath51 as the fraction of defects belonging to the @xmath32-th species : @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , as the correlation time which characterizes its fluctuations , the conditions iii ) and vi ) imply a logarithmic distribution of the correlation times of the different species .",
    "\\v ) the association between the resistance @xmath30 of the @xmath32-th species and the corresponding activation energies @xmath42 and @xmath43 has been done by adopting the criterion that increasing values of @xmath53 are paired with increasing values of @xmath30 .",
    "alternative choices are of course possible .",
    "the physical meaning and the implications of the assumptions iii ) and iv ) can be understood by the following arguments , which also provide a theoretical ground to the numerical results reported in section iii .",
    "let us consider a network made by a single species of resistors at the equilibrium , in the vanishing current limit @xmath54 ( ref . ) . in this case , it is easy to derive the following expression for the average fraction of defects under stationary fluctuations @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the probabilities of the breaking and recovery processes ( for a ssn these quantities are independent of the index @xmath32 and , at the equilibrium , they are also independent of the index @xmath27 specifying the position within the network ) .",
    "now , it is convenient to introduce the following definition : @xmath58 . since @xmath59 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : frac ] ) can be approximated as : @xmath60 since @xmath61 controls the average fraction of defects at the equilibrium , determining the `` intrinsic '' disorder of the network , it can be called intrinsic disorder parameter .",
    "thus , the energy difference @xmath62 is the effective activation energy which sets the average defect fraction in the network .",
    "furthermore , we note that a ssn can be considered as a network subjected to random telegraph noise ( rtn ) of the elemental resistors , where each resistor @xmath10 fluctuates between two states , @xmath63 ( active ) and @xmath64 ( broken ) , with the following transition rates : @xmath65 and @xmath66 . thus , according to rtn theory @xcite , the power spectral density of the elemental fluctuator is given by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the difference in the resistance of the two states and @xmath69 is the correlation time of the elemental fluctuator , given by : @xmath70 in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that this expression holds also for the correlation time @xmath7 of the fluctuations of the global network resistance @xmath71 , at least when the average fraction of defects @xmath72 is sufficiently far from the percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "in other terms , under the last condition , it is : @xmath73 . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that when a global quantity , like the network resistance , results from the superposition of several exponential relaxation processes with different correlation times , its spectral density can be written as @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 specifies the contribution to the fluctuations of the global quantity by the elemental processes whose correlation times lie in the interval between @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in conclusion , since for a ssn at the equilibrium @xmath78 , the power spectral density of the network resistance fluctuations takes the lorentzian form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : loren ] ) .",
    "the study of non equilibrium stationary fluctuations of a ssn @xcite has shown that many of the effects of an external current can be approximately described within a mean field - like framework , by considering average transition probabilities , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite , which depend on the bias through the average temperature : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the structure thermal resistance and @xmath83 is the network resistance in the vanishing current limit . of course , at high external bias , the distribution of currents and temperatures within the network becomes strongly non homogeneous , resulting in breaking and recovery probabilities , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , strongly dependent on the position of the elemental resistor within the network .",
    "this effect , which gives rise to a filamented growth of the defect pattern , characteristic of biased percolation @xcite , also implies different correlations times for the fluctuations of the elemental resistors .",
    "however , this difference in the correlation times , is never so large to modify significantly the shape of the power spectral density of the network resistance fluctuations , which remains lorentzian - like at all currents compatible with stationary states of the network @xcite . in other terms , the density function @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) is different from zero only in a relatively small interval of @xmath7 values .    coming back to a msn , it is convenient to define for all the species @xmath32 the quantities @xmath87 , which control the average fraction of defects @xmath88 at the equilibrium .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath89 determines the contribution of the @xmath32-th species to the `` intrinsic '' disorder of the network .",
    "then , by taking : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , we are assuming an approximately equal concentration of the different species at the equilibrium .",
    "in such situation , we expect that a mean field - like approach works and that the energy @xmath92 plays the same role of effective activation energy as that played by the energy difference @xmath93 in the ssn at equilibrium .",
    "in other terms , @xmath92 controls the average defect fraction in the network .",
    "furthermore , it must be noted that the conditions iii ) and vi ) , coupled with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) and  ( [ eq : tau ] ) , imply a logarithmic distribution of the correlation times : @xmath94 , with @xmath95 $ ] , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 define the time interval in which the correlation times are distributed .",
    "since @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend also on @xmath33 ( i.e. on the external temperature and on the local joule heating ) a logarithmic distribution of @xmath53 is obtained only at the equilibrium , in the vanishing current limit , when the local joule heating is negligible , @xmath98 , and all the resistors are at the same temperature : @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , apart from this effect related to a non homogeneous current distribution , in the nonlinear regime there is an increase of the average temperature which modifies the average transition probabilities , changing @xmath96 and @xmath97 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 depend on the particular material ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) and on the external conditions ( @xmath24 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the network is then obtained by monte carlo simulations which update the network resistance after a sweep of breaking and recovery processes , according to an iterative procedure detailed in ref . .",
    "the sequence of successive network configurations provides a resistance signal , @xmath104 , after an appropriate calibration of the time scale .",
    "then , depending on the external conditions and on the network parameters , the network either reaches a steady state or undergoes an irreversible electrical failure @xcite .",
    "this latter possibility is associated with the condition that the global average defect fraction @xmath105 reaches the percolation threshold , @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , for a given network at a given temperature , a threshold current value , @xmath107 , exists above which electrical breakdown occurs @xcite . for current @xmath108 , the steady state of the network is characterized by fluctuations of the defect fraction , @xmath109 , and of the resistance , @xmath110 , around their respective average values @xmath72 and @xmath111 .",
    "all the results reported here concern networks of sizes @xmath112 made by @xmath113 resistor species . for the other parameters the following values have been used as representative of realistic cases : @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xmath115 , @xmath117 k@xmath118 , @xmath119 k@xmath118 . moreover ,",
    "we have taken : @xmath120 mev , @xmath121 mev , @xmath122 mev , @xmath123 mev and @xmath124 mev ( precisely , the average value of the difference between @xmath125 and @xmath126 is @xmath127 k ) .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) and conditions iii ) and iv ) , in equilibrium ( or nearly equilibrium ) at the reference temperature @xmath128 k , the above energy values imply @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( where times are expressed in units of iterative steps ) . at @xmath132 ,",
    "the interval defined by @xmath96 and @xmath97 becomes progressively narrower while @xmath133 increases .",
    "of course , the contrary happens for @xmath134 .",
    "we underline that these values of @xmath88 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) are reported here just to give a qualitative idea of the network state and because they can be useful for the choice of the parameters @xmath135 .",
    "however all the network properties , including the average defect fraction , the correlation time of the resistance fluctuations and the other results discussed in sec .",
    "iii are obtained directly from the output of simulations .",
    "finally , the auto - correlation functions and the power spectral densities of the resistance fluctuations are calculated by analyzing stationary @xmath104 signals consisting of @xmath136 records .",
    "figure 1 reports the resistance evolution of a msn calculated at @xmath137 k in the vanishing current limit .",
    "the inset displays a small part of the same evolution over an enlarged time scale .",
    "here we notice the co - existence of different characteristic time scales in the @xmath104 signal .",
    "indeed , the long relaxation time associated with the achievement of the steady state , @xmath138 , co - exists with the shorter times characterizing the resistance fluctuations , as displayed in the inset . for comparison , fig .",
    "2 reports the time evolution of the resistance of a ssn obtained at @xmath139 k in the same bias conditions . in this case , the values of the activation energies ( @xmath140 mev and @xmath141 mev ) are chosen to give a relaxation time comparable with that of the signal in fig .",
    "now , the resistance signal is controlled by a single time scale ( @xmath142 ) and it is essentially flat over time scales shorter than @xmath7 .",
    "this is emphasized by the inset in fig . 2 where the stochastic signal resembles that of a few levels system ( it must be noted that the vertical scale of the inset in fig . 2",
    "is significantly enhanced with respect to that of fig .",
    "1 ) .    figure 3 displays the auto - correlation functions of the resistance fluctuations in figs . 1 and 2 , corresponding to the msn model ( black triangles ) and to the ssn model ( black squares ) .",
    "a log - log representation is adopted for convenience .",
    "the solid and short dashed lines represent the best - fits to the two auto - correlation functions carried out , respectively , with a power - law and an exponential law .",
    "the fitting procedure confirms the exponential decay of the correlations in the resistance fluctuations of the ssn .",
    "furthermore , it points out the existence of long - term correlations in the resistance fluctuations of the msn , characterized by a power - law decay of the auto - correlation function : @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "in particular , here we have found a value @xmath145 for the correlation exponent .",
    "we stress that the above expression for the auto - correlation function implies a divergence of the correlation time , as can be easily seen by considering the following general definition of the correlation time @xcite : @xmath146 figure 4 shows the power spectral densities of the resistance fluctuations of a msn and of a ssn calculated at 300 k by fourier trasforming the auto - correlations functions of fig .",
    ", the two grey solid lines represent the best - fits with a power - law of the msn spectrum in the low and high frequency regions .",
    "we can see that the resistance fluctuations of the multi - species network exhibit at low frequencies a power spectral density scaling as @xmath0 , with a value @xmath147 .",
    "we notice that this scaling behavior holds over several decades of frequency .",
    "this result is a consequence of the envelope of the different time scales associated with the different resistor species , described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) . instead , in the high frequency region , the slope of the spectrum is -1.53 ( in fact , the slow relaxations are ineffective at such high frequencies ) .",
    "for contrast , the grey dashed curve in fig . 4 is the best - fit with a lorentzian to the ssn spectrum .",
    "the corner frequency of the lorentzian , @xmath148 ( arbitrary units ) , is consistent with the correlation time reported in fig . 3 and obtained by the best - fit of the corresponding auto - correlation function .",
    "now , we will discuss how the temperature of the thermal bath affects the resistance fluctuations of a multi - species network at equilibrium or nearly equilibrium conditions ( low biases ) .",
    "in other terms , we will analyse the properties of the fluctuations in the ohmic regime and for different temperatures .",
    "figure 5 reports the resistance evolutions calculated at increasing temperatures : @xmath149 k ( lower curve ) and @xmath150 k ( upper curve ) .",
    "already this qualitative comparison between the @xmath104 signals shows that a temperature increase implies a significant growth of both the average resistance and the variance of the resistance fluctuations ( see also figs .",
    "1 ) . furthermore",
    ", this comparison points out a drastic reduction of the relaxation time at increasing temperatures ( more than one order of magnitude when @xmath24 rises from 300 k to 400 k ) .",
    "the temperature is also found to affect the distribution of the resistance fluctuations by increasing its skewness , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , which reports the probability density function ( pdf ) of the resistance fluctuations for several temperatures .",
    "a normalized lin - log representation has been adopted here for convenience ( @xmath151 is the root mean square deviation from the average resistance ) . the normalized gaussian distribution is also reported for comparison .",
    "the figure shows a significant non - gaussianity of the resistance fluctuations , which becomes stronger at high temperatures , when the system approaches failure conditions .",
    "this behavior is completely different from the behavior of the defect fraction fluctuations , shown in fig .",
    "7 , which remains gaussian at all temperatures .",
    "this different behavior can be easily understood .",
    "actually , at increasing temperature , the local resistivity fluctuations become progressively larger .",
    "this fact emphasizes the dynamical redistribution of currents and brings to the emergence of long - range correlations inside the network @xcite .",
    "then , the violation of the validity conditions of the central limit theorem leads to a non - gaussian resistance noise @xcite .",
    "in other terms , the results in fig .",
    "6 imply that the correlation length of the resistance fluctuations progressively increases with the temperature .",
    "a discussion of the distribution of the resistance fluctuations and the role played on the non - gaussianity by the size , shape and disorder of a ssn is reported in refs . , where the link with the universal distribution of the fluctuations of bramwell , holdsworth and pinton ( bhp ) @xcite is analyzed .",
    "figure 8 reports the auto - correlation functions of the resistance fluctuations of a msn calculated at @xmath152 k and @xmath153 k. to help the comparison , the auto - correlation function at @xmath137 k ( already shown in fig .",

    "such kinds of mixed decays of the correlations , non - exponential and non power - law , are often found in the transition of a complex system from short - term correlated to long - term correlated regimes @xcite .",

    "actually , fig .",
    "8 highlights a strong reduction of the correlation time of the resistance fluctuations as the temperature increases .",
    "this result can be understood in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) , by considering the thermally activated expressions of the breaking and recovery probabilities .",
    "indeed , the increase of temperature above @xmath167 implies the reduction of the ratio @xmath168 and the correspondent narrowing of the interval @xmath169 $ ] , where the @xmath53 are distributed .",
    "this trend tends to suppress the power - law decay of correlations in favor of the exponential decay . for similar reasons , the temperature decrease below @xmath167 ,",
    "implies the opposite trend with the correlations keeping their power - law decay over wider time scales .",
    "for example , at @xmath170 k the ratio @xmath168 becomes @xmath171 .",
    "thus , we can define the transition temperature , @xmath172 , as the temperature value which signs the crossing from a long - term correlated behavior ( occurring for @xmath173 ) , to a behavior characterized by a finite and relatively short correlation time ( occurring for @xmath174 ) .",
    "the correlation time of the resistance fluctuations can be directly estimated by making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_def ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : power_exp ] ) . in terms of the best - fit parameters of the auto - correlation function ,",
    "it is easy to derive the following analytical expression for @xmath7 : @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the gamma function .",
    "the values of @xmath7 calculated in this way increase at decreasing temperatures . in particular , @xmath7 exhibits a sharp increase when @xmath24 approaches @xmath172 , in agreement with the long - term decay of the correlation function at this temperature .",
    "we have found that the behavior of @xmath7 versus temperature is well fitted by the power - law : @xmath177 .",

    "the dashed straight line corresponds to the above mentioned power - law .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that : @xmath181 . furthermore , as a result of the particular choice of the parameters adopted in the present calculations , the transition temperature is close also to the reference temperature , @xmath182 .",
    "however we remark that the temperature @xmath167 has been introduced in the model merely to help the choice of the activation energies ( to provide a sufficiently wide interval @xmath169 $ ] ) . while , @xmath92 is the relevant input parameter which determines @xmath172 .",
    "figure 10 displays the spectral densities of the resistance fluctuations calculated at @xmath152 k and @xmath153 k. the grey lines represent the best - fits with a power - law of the msn spectra in the low and high frequency regions .",
    "precisely , at low - frequencies , the slopes of the lines are -0.87 and -0.78 respectively for @xmath149 k and @xmath150 k. instead , at high frequencies the respective slopes are -1.31 and -1.02 .",
    "thus , in both frequency regions , low and high , the slopes of the specra are reduced when the temperature increases .",
    "we conclude that at @xmath174 the power spectrum keeps the @xmath19 form with the value of @xmath183 significantly decreasing below unity .",
    "this decrease is pointed out in fig .",
    "11 , which reports @xmath183 as a function of the temperature .",
    "the dashed line in fig .",
    "11 is the best - fit with a linear law .",
    "we notice that such a decrease of the exponent , from @xmath9 to @xmath184 , is frequently observed in the experiments at intermediate temperatures @xcite . on the other hand , many experiments have pointed out a strong dependence of the detailed behavior of @xmath185 also on the particular material @xcite . in this respect",
    ", we remark that in this work we are focusing our attention to the general features of the spectra , related to the term of correlations , rather than to the interpretation of a particular set of experiments .",
    "actually , in our model the quantity @xmath92 ( determining the transition temperature @xmath172 ) is the input parameter which can be adjusted for a quantitative fit of experiments .",
    "furthermore , we stress that the monotonic decrease of @xmath183 for @xmath174 is obtained here in the linear regime of currents , i.e. neglecting joule heating effects .",
    "actually , these effects , whose importance also depends on the temperature , can give rise to a more complicated behavior of @xmath183 versus @xmath24 , which are outside the interest of this research but can be implemented with minor efforts .",
    "now , to complete the analysis of the msn model , we consider the dependence on the temperature of the average resistance , @xmath111 , and of the variance of the resistance fluctuations , @xmath186 for a multi - species network in nearly equilibrium conditions . this dependence has been already qualitatively depicted in figs . 1 and 5 .",
    "however here we want to quantify these behaviors , also with the purpose of checking by numerical results the validity of the mean field - like approach discussed in section ii .",
    "figure 12 displays @xmath111 as a function of the temperature , while the inset shows the dependence on the temperature of the average defect fraction .",
    "we have performed a one parameter best - fit of the numerical values of @xmath72 with the expression : @xmath187 .",
    "we have found @xmath188 , a value compatible with the expression : @xmath189 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) qualitatively accounts for the behavior of the average defect fraction versus temperature .    for what concerns the dependence on temperature of the average resistance , in percolation theory",
    "@xcite it is well known the following scaling relation between the network resistance and the defect fraction : @xmath190 .",
    "we note that in the present model at the vanishing current limit @xcite , the percolation is uncorrelated and the exponent @xmath191 takes the universal value @xcite @xmath192 , while @xmath193 @xcite . the dashed curve in fig .",
    "12 shows the best - fit of the numerical data for the average resistance with the expression : @xmath194 . in the best - fit procedure the values of @xmath191 and @xmath106",
    "have been taken fixed to their theoretical values , while we have taken : @xmath187 .",
    "the values found for the fitting parameters are : @xmath195 @xmath115 and @xmath196 .",
    "thus , the dependence on temperature of the average resistance of a msn in the linear regime is well described by the usual scaling relation coupled with the mean field - like expression of @xmath72 .",
    "figure 13 reports the variance of the resistance fluctuations as a function of the temperature .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood by considering before the power - law relation between the variance of the resistance fluctuations and the average resistance @xcite : @xmath197 , often written in terms of the relative variance , as : @xmath198 where @xmath199 . by reporting on a log - log plot the relative variance @xmath200 versus @xmath111 , the calculated slope provides for the exponent @xmath201 the value @xmath202 we note that this value of the relative noise exponent agrees with the value reported in ref . .",
    "this agreement is consistent with the fact that the msn model generalizes the results of ref . to networks characterized by @xmath19 noise .",
    "now , we can use the information on the exponent @xmath203 to check the consistency among the dependence on temperature of @xmath186 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , the scaling relations between @xmath204 and between @xmath205 .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "13 shows the best - fit to the variance of the resistance fluctuations considered versus temperature , with the following expression : @xmath206 where the fitting parameters take the values : @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "thus , a mean field - like framework is overall able to account for the dependence on temperature of the lowest two moments of resistance fluctuation distribution .    until now we have analysed the resistance fluctuations of the network in equilibrium or in nearly equilibrium conditions , in the ohmic regime , and for different temperatures .",
    "now , we will briefly discuss the non equilibrium properties of the fluctuations at high biases , in the nonlinear regime , and for a given temperature .",
    "figure 15 shows the auto - correlation functions of the resistance fluctuations of a msn for increasing values of the external current .",
    "all the functions are calculated at @xmath137 k. the open squares represent the auto - correlation of the resistance fluctuations in the ohmic regime : @xmath210 ma , the other three curves correspond to the non - linear regime .",
    "precisely , black triangles : @xmath211 ma ; open circles : @xmath212 ma ; grey diamonds : @xmath213 ma @xmath214 .",
    "thus , the last curve corresponds to failure of the network , i.e. non - stationary resistance fluctuations . in this case , the auto - correlation function has been calculated by considering only the nearly - stationary portion of the @xmath104 signal ( after subtraction of a linear trend ) .",
    "the dotted grey line is the best - fit with a power - law of slope @xmath215 , the dashed lines are the best - fits with eq .",
    "( [ eq : power_exp ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath216 corresponding respectively to : @xmath211 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 ma are the following : @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 ( in all cases , the numerical error is estimated as @xmath222 ) .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath223 corresponding to the same currents respectively are : @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 .",
    "thus , both @xmath216 and @xmath223 decrease at increasing biases and for high biases @xmath166 . in other terms , at increasing currents , time correlations decay progressively faster , the long - term correlated behavior is destroyed and it emerges a trend towards a simple exponential decay .    the corresponding effect in the frequency domain of increasing biases is shown in fig . 16 , which reports the power spectral densities at @xmath137 k. the curve ( 1 ) is obtained for the ohmic regime ( @xmath210 ma ) ; the other three curves display the spectra in the non - linear regime .",
    "the solid grey lines are the best - fits with power - laws in the low and high frequency regions of the spectrum .",
    "the slopes are specified in the figure .",
    "we note that : i ) the corner frequency between the two regions progressively moves towards lower frequencies at increasing biases ; ii ) the slopes in the high frequency region are : @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 respectively for @xmath210 , @xmath231 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 ma , i.e. the slopes increase at increasing currents ( in all cases , the numerical error on the slope values is estimated as @xmath222 ) .",
    "thus , at high biases , the spectral densities show a trend towards a transition from an @xmath8 to a lorentzian behavior .",
    "however , we remark that for the present choice of the initial conditions and/or the numerical values of the parameters used in these calculations we have not got a pure lorentzian spectrum .",
    "we have developed a stochastic model to investigate the @xmath19 , with @xmath232 , resistance noise in disordered materials .",
    "more precisely , we have considered the resistance fluctuations of a thin resistor with granular structure in different stationary states : from nearly equilibrium up to far from equilibrium conditions .",
    "furthermore we have also considered fluctuations in non - stationary states , associated with failure of the electric properties .",
    "this system has been modeled as a two - dimensional network made by different species of elementary resistors .",
    "the steady state of this multi - species network is determined by the competition among different thermally activated and stochastic processes of breaking and recovery of the elementary resistors .",
    "the network properties have been studied by monte carlo simulations as a function of the temperature and applied current , in both ohmic and non - ohmic regimes .",
    "a mean field - like framework has been also used to qualitatively describe the dependence on temperature of the lowest two moments of the resistance fluctuation distribution .",
    "furthermore , the correlation properties of the resistance fluctuations have been analyzed in both the time and the frequency domains .",
    "the model gives rise to resistance fluctuations with different power spectra , depending on the external conditions .",
    "thus it provides a unified approach to the study of materials exhibiting either lorentzian noise or @xmath19 noise . by analyzing the correlations in the time domain",
    ", it has been found that the resistance fluctuations display a cross - over from long - term correlations to intermediate - term correlations .",
    "although a trend towards an exponential decay has been identified , for the present choice of the parameters / initial conditions , we have not got a single exponential decay .",
    "however , the model proposed seems able to account for the complex interplay exerted on the correlation properties of the resistance fluctuations by the external conditions and resulting in the complicate behavior of the noise exponent observed in many experiments . in perspective",
    ", it should be explored the role of different initial conditions : such as unequal presence of the species and/or non - uniform distribution inside the network , which can give rise to interesting spatio - temporal organization patterns .",
