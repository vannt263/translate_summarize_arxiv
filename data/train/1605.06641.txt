    "mott insulators with spin - orbit ( so ) coupling have recently been topics of great interest because of the plethora of novel phases and behaviors they are expected to exhibit @xcite .",
    "iridium based transition metal oxides are ideal systems to investigate the novel behaviors predicted to arise due to the interplay of electron correlations and so coupling @xcite . in recent years honeycomb lattice iridates",
    "a@xmath6iro@xmath13 ( a = na , li ) have been subjects of intense scrutiny which was fuelled initially by the suggestion of exotic topological properties and quantum spin hall effect  @xcite and by suggestions that these could be realizations of the kitaev - heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "na@xmath0iro@xmath1 was found to undergo novel magnetic ordering at low temperatures suggesting that it was nt situated in the strong kitaev limit where a spin liquid was expected @xcite .",
    "recently however , evidence for dominant bond - directional magnetic exchange and real space - magnetic moment locking has been found in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 @xcite . for ruthenates ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is expected to be comparitively smaller .",
    "nevertheless the compound @xmath14rucl@xmath1 , which has a network of ru@xmath15 @xmath16 moments on a honeycomb lattice has recently been studied in the quest for a candidate kitaev material @xcite .",
    "observations of a quasi - continuum of excitations in raman scattering for both na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and @xmath14-rucl@xmath1 has been argued to be evidence for proximity to the quantum spin liquid state in the dominant kitaev limit @xcite .",
    "more recently , when ir@xmath17 was partially replaced by ru@xmath17 in a@xmath6ir@xmath18ru@xmath19o@xmath13 ( a = na , li ) , the materials were found to remain insulating and a spin - glass state is observed at low temperatures highlighting the presence of competing interactions and phases in the parent iridate compounds @xcite .",
    "the ruthenate family a@xmath6ruo@xmath20 ( a = na , li ) is also known to adopt a honeycomb lattice structure but with nominal @xmath21 moments arising from the low - spin state of ru@xmath22 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of na@xmath0ruo@xmath1 were reported to crystallize in the @xmath23 structure @xcite similar to early reports on na@xmath0iro@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "more recently , single crystals of na@xmath0ruo@xmath1 were synthesized and found to crystallize in the related but more symmetric @xmath2 structure @xcite .",
    "single crystal na@xmath0ruo@xmath1 was found to be a local moment magnet which orders antiferromagnetically below @xmath24  k @xcite .",
    "the structure and magnetic properties of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 seem to be very sensitive to synthesis conditions and quality of samples .",
    "initial reports on polycrystalline samples suggested a room temperature @xmath23 monoclinic structure and metallic paramagnetic behavior below @xmath25  k @xcite .",
    "later a comprehensive study on polycrystalline samples of li@xmath6ruo@xmath20 revealed an unusual second order structural phase transition near @xmath10  k from a nearly perfect honeycomb lattice @xmath2 structure at high temperature to a low temperature structure with a distorted honeycomb lattice p2@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this structural transition was acompanied by an increase in resistance and loss of magnetization .",
    "nearly perfect hexagons of the high temperature @xmath2 phase undergo strong distortion , leading to a low temperature structure with significant shortening of one of the three inequivalent ru - ru bonds on each honeycomb @xcite .",
    "based on dft calculations on the low and high temperature structures it was proposed that li@xmath6ruo@xmath20 undergoes a transition from a highly correlated metal to a molecular orbital insulator involving ru - ru dimerization and spin - singlet formation @xcite .",
    "an alternative mechanism of spin - singlet formation driven by magnetoelastic coupling has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the structural ru - ru dimers across the phase transition has been studied recently using pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis of high energy powder x - ray data .",
    "the pdf analysis allows the tracking of short - ranged structural order .",
    "it was found that dynamically fluctuating dimers survive at temperatures well above the transition temperature @xmath10  k @xcite .",
    "this suggests a scenario where a valence bond crystal in the low temperature phase melts into a valence bond liquid at high temperatures .",
    "such a scenario is supported by recent ru site dilution experiments @xcite .",
    "an electronic structure study has highlighted the importance of electronic correlations and proposed that a combination of local - moment behavior and molecular orbital formation could be the correct picture for this material @xcite    recently a careful study of the effect of synthesis conditions on the structure and magnetic behavior of polycrysatalline samples has been carried out @xcite .",
    "it was found that all samples crystallized in the @xmath3 structure at room temperature and showed the ru - dimerization transition at high temperatures . however , the details of the structure and the magnetic properties strongly depends on the synthesis conditions .",
    "the best quality samples revealed that the magneto - structural transition is first - order in nature with a much higher onset temperature of @xmath27  k @xcite .",
    "lastly , single crystals of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 have recently been synthesized .",
    "the crystals are found to crystallize at room temperature in either the @xmath2 or the @xmath3 structures depending on synthesis conditions .",
    "however , in complete contrast to all existing polycrystalline work @xcite , neither of these crystals show the magneto - structural transitions at high temperature .",
    "they instead show curie - weiss behavior below @xmath28  k and magnetic ordering at low temperatures into supposedly antiferromagnetic states @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report the first crystal growth of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and @xmath11 na substituted li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 crystallizing in the @xmath3 structure at room temperature and showing the magneto - structural transition at high temperatures .",
    "we are therefore able to study for the first time the magnetic anisotropy across the high temperature magneto - structural transition .",
    "we observe that for li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the transition might occur in two steps with a first - order structural transition occurring first ( onset @xmath29  k ) which then drives the magnetic ru - ru dimerization transition ( @xmath12  k ) . replacing just @xmath11 li by na leads to a reversal of the magnetic anisotropy although the first - order magneto - structural transition is still seen at @xmath12  k. room temperature structural studies show that the ru - ru structural dimerization arrangement is also changed in the na substituted samples . while the li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 shows 2 short and 4 long ru - ru bonds on each honeycomb in an armchair pattern as previously seen @xcite , the na doped samples show 4 short and 2 long ru - ru bonds on each honeycomb in an arrangement which can be viewed as two inter - penetrating armchair patterns .",
    "the single crystalline samples of ( li@xmath18na@xmath19)@xmath30ruo@xmath1 ( @xmath31 ) have been synthesized .",
    "the starting materials were li@xmath0co@xmath1 ( 99.995@xmath32 alfa aesar , na@xmath0co@xmath1 ( 99.995@xmath32 alfa aesar ) and ru metal powder ( 99.95@xmath32 alfa aesar ) .",
    "single crystals were grown using a self flux growth method .",
    "off - stoichiometric amounts of starting materials were mixed and placed in an alumina crucible with a lid , heated to @xmath33c for 24  h for calcination and then furnace cooled to room temperature .",
    "crystal growth was done by keeping the calcined mixture for long periods ( @xmath34@xmath35  h ) at temperatures between @xmath36c  @xmath37c after which the furnace is turned off and allowed to cool to room temperature .",
    "shiny plate like single crystals ( size @xmath38 ) were found to grow on top of semi - melted polycrystalline powder .",
    "growth of crystals with higher na concentrations were tried but were not successful . the structure and composition of the resulting samples",
    "were checked by single - crystal and powder x - ray diffraction ( pxrd ) , and chemical analysis using energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis with a jeol scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",
    "the pxrd was obtained by a rigaku diffractometer with cu k@xmath39 radiation in 2@xmath40 range from 10@xmath41 to 90@xmath41 with 0.02@xmath41 step size .",
    "anisotropic magnetic susceptibility measurements upto @xmath42  k were measured on a collection of co - aligned crystals with total mass @xmath43  mg using the vsm oven option on a quantum design physical property measurement system .",
    "from room temperature single crystal and powder x - ray diffraction , we conclude that all samples adopt the @xmath44/m space group .",
    "a full single crystal refinement was not possible because the crystals have multiple twins rotated around the @xmath45 axis .",
    "however , it was possible to determine the space group and cell parameters using single crystal diffraction .",
    "cell parameters were also obtained by performing rietveld refinements of the pxrd patterns obtained on the crushed crystals .",
    "fig.[fig-1 ] shows representative results of rietveld refinement of the pxrd patterns for ( li@xmath4na@xmath5)@xmath30ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the fractional atomic positions obtained from the refinement are given in table  [ table - structural - parameters ] .",
    "the unit cell parameters and the relevant bond lengths extracted from rietveld refinement of the powder diffraction data are listed in table  [ table - lattice - parameters ] .",
    "the cell parameters change significantly ( specially the @xmath46-axis ) as li is partially replaced by na .",
    "the presence of na in the doped crystals and its concentration relative to ru was confirmed using energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy on several spots on the same crystal and on several crystals and was found to be close to the nominal concentration targeted in the starting material .    the room temperature crystal structure of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and li viewed perpendicular to the honeycomb planes",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - structure ] to highlight the ru - ru dimerization pattern .",
    "for li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 we find , consistent with previous work , that one ( @xmath47 ) out of the three inequivalent ru - ru bonds is considerably shorter compared to the other two which are of similar lengths .",
    "surprisingly , for just 5% na substitution for li , the dimerization pattern changes and we now have two short ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and one long bonds . the ru - ru bond lengths are given in table  [ table - lattice - parameters ] and the dimerization patterns shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - structure ]  ( a ) and  ( b ) , respectively . for li@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "as observed @xcite and explained @xcite previously the dimers on the @xmath47 bond form an armchair pattern .",
    "for the na substituted sample , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 bonds dimerize and form inter - penetrating armchairs which run along the @xmath46-axis .    .",

    "[ fig-3 ] .",
    "surprisingly , with only a @xmath11 na substitution for li , the anisotropy is reversed ( @xmath54 ) compared to what was observed for li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the magneto - structural transition can be seen in both sets of data .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ]  inset shows the @xmath52 and @xmath53 data in the temperature range @xmath55  k to @xmath56  k to highlight the transition .",
    "data were recorded while warming from @xmath28  k to @xmath50  k and then while cooling back again at a rate of @xmath57  k / min .",
    "we see that there is a thermal hysteresis between the warming and cooling data indicating that the first order nature of the phase transition persists in na substituted samples .",
    "peaks in the derivatives of the @xmath58 data are taken as the approximate transition temperatures and are given in table  [ table - transition temperature ] .",
    "we have grown the first single crystals of ( li@xmath18na@xmath19)@xmath30ruo@xmath1 ( @xmath31 ) crystallizing in the @xmath3 structure at room temperature and showing a magneto - structural transition at high temperatures . using magnetic susceptibility @xmath8 measurements for temperatures @xmath7  k",
    "we observe that for li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , @xmath59 . additionally , we observe a first - order high temperature coupled magneto - structural transition which seems to occur in two steps .",
    "this is most evident in the @xmath53 data .",
    "the higher temperature transition has an onset as high as @xmath60  k and a mid - point around @xmath61  k as seen by the peak in @xmath62 measured while warming up to @xmath50  k. this high temperature transition is hysteretic with a thermal hysteresis of @xmath63  k indicating its first - order nature .",
    "the lower temperature transition in @xmath53 occurs at @xmath64  k , is very sharp , is accompanied by an abrupt fall in @xmath8 , and with almost no thermal hysteresis .",
    "these observations suggest that the higher temperature , hysteretic transition is the structural dimerization transition while the lower temperature transition where we observe a sharp fall in @xmath8 is the magnetic transition involving ru - ru singlet formation .",
    "thus for li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the two transitions most likely occur at slightly different temperatures with the structural dimerization transition occuring first and triggering the magnetic ru - ru singlet formation .",
    "the onset temperature of @xmath56  k is much higher than previously observed ( @xmath12  k ) and indicates the high quality of the samples .",
    "just a @xmath11 substitution of na for li leads to interesting magnetic and structural changes .",
    "the high temperature @xmath58 data show that the magnetic anisotropy is reversed compared to li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 with @xmath54 for ( li@xmath4na@xmath5)@xmath30ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the arrangement of ru - ru dimers on the honeycomb lattice also changes . for li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 rietveld refinements of room temperature powder x - ray data",
    "reveal that one ( @xmath47 ) out of the three inequivalent ru - ru bonds on the honeycomb lattice is shortened compared to the other two which are almost equal to each other as can be seen in table  [ table - lattice - parameters ] . for ( li@xmath4na@xmath5)@xmath30ruo@xmath1 we find that two ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) out of the three ru - ru bonds are smaller and almost equal while the third is much larger .",
    "the armchair arrangement of the dimers in li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is consistent with previous reports @xcite .",
    "the dimer arrangement in ( li@xmath4na@xmath5)@xmath30ruo@xmath1 can be viewed as two inter - penetrating armchairs formed on the @xmath47 and @xmath48 bonds , respectively . this suggests a possible change in the orbital ordering pattern for the na substituted sample .",
