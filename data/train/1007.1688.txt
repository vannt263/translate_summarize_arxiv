    "the observation of the 5/2 fqhe , with two completely filled landau levels ( spin up and down ) belonging to the lowest orbital ( n=0 ) and the half filling of the second ( n=1 ) orbital landau level ( sll ) , has remained an intriguing enigma 23 years after its discovery@xcite .",
    "the 5/2 fqhe and its conjugate state ( at 7/2 = 6 - 5/2 ) are the only known even denominator fqhe unambiguously observed in a single - layer 2d system .",
    "all other @xmath0 observed fqh states obey the odd - denominator rule , consistent with the pauli principle , as originally described by laughlin in his seminal theory of the 1/3 fqhe@xcite .",
    "+ in addition to the intriguing even - denominator nature of the 5/2 fqhe , the other puzzling aspect of the 5/2 state is its existence in the sll where very few ( less than 10 ) fqh states have been observed , in sharp contrast to the @xmath1 lowest landau level ( lll ) where @xmath270 fqh states have been established@xcite .",
    "the even denominator filling fractions @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the lll do not manifest any incompressible fqhe , and are instead compressible fermi liquid states .",
    "another characteristic feature of the 5/2 fqhe is its very fragile nature with a small measured activation gap @xmath20.1 - 0.5  k , even in the world s highest mobility ( up to @xmath5 ) samples .",
    "the 5/2 fqhe is thus observed only at very low temperature ( @xmath6 mk ) and in samples with very high mobility ( @xmath7 ) . these constraints ( very low temperature and very high mobility )",
    "have limited the experimental investigation of the 5/2 fqhe and almost twenty five years after its discovery , the precise nature of the observed 5/2 fqhe and its underlying theoretical description are still a subject of active debate . + there is , however , an almost consensus @xmath8 candidate for the 5/2 fqhe , the moore - read pfaffian ( pf ) wavefunction@xcite , which is a chiral spinless @xmath9 paired bcs state for the composite fermions at 5/2 filling .",
    "the low - lying quasiparticle excitations of this state are known to be ising anyons obeying the @xmath10 conformal field theory universality class@xcite .",
    "being a paired state of fermions , the pf can have an even denominator since it is not constrained by the pauli principle .",
    "there has been a great deal of recent theoretical and experimental interest in the 5/2 fqhe following the concrete suggestion of the construction of a topological 5/2 qubit@xcite using the braiding of the non - abelian quasiparticles of the pf state , provided the observed state is indeed the proposed theoretical non - abelian pf state .",
    "( all our discussions in this work with respect to spin - polarization of the 5/2 state and the appropriate theoretical description apply equally well to the so - called anti - pf non - abelian wavefunction also , since the anti - pf state has the same bulk properties as the pf state , and is also thought to be completely spin - polarized we refer the reader to refs.@xcite for a discussion of the possible distinction between the edge properties of the pf and the anti - pf theoretical candidate states . ) + recent experimental work @xcite performed on the edge , in a narrow constriction , has shown the inter - edge tunneling to be consistent with a 5/2 fqhe emanating from a non - abelian spin - polarized ground state .",
    "also exciting is the recent observation of interference patterns @xcite which alternate between those of quasiparticles with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this interference pattern has been interpreted as being equivalent to the observation of non - abelian statistics although there exists no satisfactory theory explaining the observations .",
    "while these edge experiments are encouraging , there remain complications associated with the edge , such as edge reconstruction and coupling between bulk quasiparticles and the edge , which in the end can make their interpretation difficult .",
    "the question that arises naturally is whether or not there is any evidence at all for a pf state at 5/2 filling in the bulk of a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "experiments aimed at direct shot - noise - based measurements of the quasiparticle charge in the 5/2 fqhe state have given ambiguous and non - universal results@xcite varying in a complicated manner with temperature and tunneling strength , which are inconsistent with the bulk 5/2 state being a non - abelian pf state .",
    "+ there is however compelling theoretical evidence@xcite , based on numerical studies of small systems containing a few ( 8 - 20 ) electrons , that the actual experimental state in the presence of realistic inter - particle coulomb interaction is indeed adiabatically connected to the pf state , however there is at the moment no experimental evidence showing that the bulk is indeed described by the pf wavefunction .",
    "we argue below , based on all energy gap measurements of the 5/2 fqhe available in the literature , that the experimental evidence for the 5/2 state ( in the bulk ) tends more towards a spin unpolarized rather than a spin - polarized state , in contradiction with the prediction from a pf state .",
    "+ the specific physical question which is the primary topic of the current work relates to the nature of the spin polarization of the 5/2 fqh state . in particular , the pf wavefunction is fully spin - polarized , and direct numerical work@xcite indicates that the exact small - system state has lower ground state energy in the fully spin - polarized case than in the unpolarized case , although the energy difference between the two is small . since the spin - polarized pf wavefunction also has relatively good overlap , albeit not excellent , with the exact numerical small system wavefunction , the theoretical consensus has almost universally been that the experimentally observed 5/2 fqh state is _ i ) _ fully spin - polarized , and _",
    "ii ) _ described by the pf wavefunction ( or more precisely , belongs to the same non - abelian universality class as the pf wave function and is adiabatically connected to the pf ) .",
    "+ in sharp contrast to the theoretical consensus based on small - system numerical work ( which can , in principle , be questioned since the experimental system has @xmath13 electrons whereas numerical work is typically based on @xmath14 electrons ) , there has been absolutely no direct experimental evidence supporting the claim of full spin - polarization of the 5/2 fqh state . in fact , existing ( mostly circumstantial ) experimental evidence hints towards a spin unpolarized 5/2 fqhe .",
    "first , the application of a parallel magnetic field ( _ i.e. _ along the 2d plane without affecting the landau quantization ) , which presumably varies the zeeman energy , is found to rapidly destroy the 5/2 fqhe even for a relatively modest field .",
    "second , the 5/2 fqhe is found to exist at rather low magnetic field ( down to 2.5  t ) ; in fact , the measured 5/2 fqhe activation gap ( @xmath20.25  k ) at 2.5  t@xcite is _ larger _ than that at 10.5  t(@xmath15  k ) @xcite , which seems to imply that the state is spin unpolarized since it is weakening with increasing magnetic field ( whereas the coulomb energy by itself increases with increasing magnetic field ) .",
    "motivated both by the fundamental importance of the question and the stark dichotomy between the theoretical consensus and the experimental lack of evidence , we critically revisit the issue of 5/2 spin - polarization using the existing experimental data as well as some new transport data of our own .",
    "our analysis rather supports the conclusion that the experimentally observed 5/2 fqh state is more likely to be spin - unpolarized than spin - polarized .",
    "our conclusion , along with recent optical and light scattering measurements @xcite , throws the subject of the nature of the 5/2 fqhe into serious jeopardy , necessitating a rethinking of the possible spin unpolarized 5/2 fqhe candidate states .",
    "in addition , it is known that at higher temperatures the 5/2 incompressible fqhe goes into a compressible fermi liquid phase which appears to be spin - unpolarized@xcite .",
    "the same absence of spin polarization is also found for the compressible @xmath16 lll state@xcite .",
    "our analysis of experimental data follows two related but distinct tracks .",
    "first , we consider the existing activation gap measurements as a function of the ( perpendicular ) magnetic field @xmath17 to verify whether the measured gap @xmath18 is more consistent with the spin - polarized or unpolarized 5/2 fqhe .",
    "second , we consider the parallel field ( @xmath19 ) induced suppression @xmath20 of the 5/2 fqhe to verify its consistency ( or not ) with a spin unpolarized 5/2 ground state .",
    "making the standard assumption that the activation gap @xmath21 essentially measures an excitation gap , we can write down the following simple general formula for the measured gap , @xmath22 , as a function of the perpendicular @xmath17 and the parallel magnetic field @xmath19 , @xmath23    the three terms in eq .  [ eq : gap ] correspond respectively to the increasing incompressible gap with the perpendicular field due to the increasing coulomb energy as @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the magnetic length ) modified by the finite width effect ( parameterized by the @xmath26 function ) which suppresses@xcite the coulomb energy , the disorder effect suppressing the gap which may increase with the parallel field , and finally the zeeman energy term which is proportional to the total magnetic field @xmath27 .",
    "the finite width correction parameterized by the function @xmath28 in the first term is usually only a small correction ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gaas background lattice dielectric constant , and theoretically @xmath32 for the 5/2 fqhe according to exact numerical calculations .",
    "the disorder effect , parameterized by the second term is known@xcite to be extremely important quantitatively for the 5/2 fqhe . in the absence of any applied parallel field , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the gap suppression due to the disorder broadening of the sample .",
    "it is customary to take @xmath35 as the single - particle broadening defined by the dingle temperature , @xmath36 , as measured by the low field sdh oscillations .",
    "we adopt this idea in our analysis .",
    "finally , in the third term @xmath37 denotes the zeeman splitting strength ( with @xmath38 the lande @xmath38-factor and @xmath39 the bohr magneton ) with the coefficient @xmath40 controlling the nature of spin polarization of the system . for a spin - polarized ground state ,",
    "@xmath41 unless the relevant low - lying excitations are spin - reversed in which case @xmath42 . for a spin unpolarized ground state , where the zeeman energy should suppress fqhe , we choose @xmath43 . in principle",
    ", @xmath38 can be used as an unknown parameter for a partially spin polarized state , but we take @xmath44 ( unless otherwise stated ) to be consistent with the known value of the @xmath38-factor in gaas .",
    "below we will consider two distinct cases separately : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( fig.1 ) , and @xmath48 ( fig.2 ) . + before presenting a detailed comparison between eq .",
    "[ eq : gap ] and the experimentally measured activation gap , we point out that there is a qualitative difference between spin - polarized ( @xmath41 ) and unpolarized ( @xmath49 ) situations according to eq .",
    "[ eq : gap ] .",
    "in particular , assuming no parallel field , _ i.e. _ @xmath45 and @xmath50=1 , and a @xmath17-independent disorder broadening ( a standard approximation in most theoretical fqhe analysis ) , eq.[eq : gap ] implies a maximum in @xmath21 as a function of @xmath17 at a value @xmath51 for the spin unpolarized case due to the increasing coulomb energy @xmath52 that opposes the decreasing zeeman term ( @xmath53 ) . there is no such maximum as a function of @xmath17 for the spin polarized case ( @xmath40=0 ) .",
    "this maximum as a function of @xmath17 translates directly into a maximum in the activation energy as a function of the sample density ( @xmath54 ) since the filling factor is fixed ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "then , a clear prediction of the theory is that if the 5/2 state is spin unpolarized , then the corresponding activation gap would show a maximum as a function of electron density at a density of @xmath56 . on the other hand",
    ", a spin polarized 5/2 fqhe will manifest an activation gap increasing monotonically with @xmath17 .",
    "although the actual experimental situation shown in fig.1 for @xmath45 is considerably compromised by disorder effects which depend on density , we believe that the whole collection of the existing experimental data on the 5/2 fqhe is more consistent with there being a maximum in the measured activation gap around a density of @xmath57 . in particular , the measured activation gap at @xmath58 by zhang _",
    "@xcite for a sample with electronic density @xmath59 is a factor of two smaller than that at @xmath60@xcite at a density @xmath61 , in spite of the two samples having very comparable mobilities .",
    "this trend is more consistent with the fqhe being spin - unpolarized than spin - polarized .",
    "conversely , if the 5/2 fqhe is considered to be spin - polarized , one would have expected a very large measured gap at 10.5  t. in addition , the early measurements of pan _ et al._@xcite , although not decisive , seem to clearly indicate a shallow maximum , as implied by eq .  [",
    "eq : gap ] with @xmath62 ( _ i.e. _ spin unpolarized 5/2 fqhe ) , in the activation gap data@xcite .",
    "+     ( _ i.e. _ not including the finite width correction ) , the trend of these data points can be fit to eq .",
    "[ eq : gap ] with the following parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath49 and @xmath44(solid black ) ; @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath49 and @xmath67(dashed green ) ; @xmath65 , @xmath68 , @xmath49 and @xmath69(dotted blue ) ; @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath41(dot - dashed red ) .",
    "including the finite width correction for a typical 30 nm qw , new set of fit parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath44 ( dashed purple ) are needed for a better fit , but the qualitative curve shape remains the same .",
    "the inset shows the energy gaps for the spin - polarized 1/3 fqh state determined using transport measurements @xcite and direct measurement of the chemical jump@xcite .",
    "these data points are fit to eq .",

    "[ eq : gap ] , assuming a few distinct parameter values ( since @xmath79 is not always reported for all the samples used in fqhe activation measurements ) .",
    "although no compelling decisive conclusion is possible , we believe that the comparison gives a preference to the 5/2 fqh state being spin unpolarized ( _ i.e. _ @xmath49 ) rather than spin polarized ( @xmath41 ) . in particular , the expected monotonic increase of the gap ( @xmath52 ) with increasing magnetic field for the spin - polarized situation is simply not apparent in the data .",
    "conversely , all of the data taken together ( using samples from different groups ) is more consistent with the gap first increasing with @xmath17 and then decreasing at large @xmath17 with a shallow maximum around @xmath80 , which is consistent with the 5/2 state being spin unpolarized .",
    "we emphasize that we can only discuss the general trend of the data as being more consistent with the 5/2 state being spin - unpolarized since @xmath21 seems to be typically smaller at larger @xmath17 than at smaller @xmath17 .",
    "of the two sets of existing data in a density - tunable sample , the data from pan _",
    "et al._@xcite clearly manifest a shallow maximum indicating the lack of spin polarization whereas the data from nuebler _ et al._@xcite exists only over a small range of low @xmath17 values to draw any decisive conclusion .",
    "last , to emphasize the unexpected behaviour of the 5/2 gap with the perpendicular field , we show as an inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1/3 ] the magnetic field dependence of the 1/3 energy gap measured by various groups .",
    "as expected for a spin - polarized fqh state , the 1/3 energy gap increases monotonically with @xmath17 .",
    "+ now we turn to the consideration of the measured activation gap in an applied parallel field ( @xmath81 . everything else being equal , @xmath21 for a spin - polarized situation should either increase with or not exhibit any dependence on the parallel magnetic field ( @xmath19 ) . on the other hand @xmath21 for the spin - unpolarized situation should decrease monotonically with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "this is precisely the experimental observation for all 5/2 fqhe studied in the literature .",
    "the truly puzzling phenomenon , however , is that the measured activation gap @xmath21 decreases with increasing @xmath19 , also for other fqh states , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 , where the ground state ( e.g. @xmath82 ) is most definitely spin - polarized .",
    "this leads to the conundrum that the parallel field induced destruction of the 5/2 fqhe _ can not _ be naively attributed entirely to its spin - unpolarized nature since fully spin - polarized fqh states can also be suppressed by a large applied @xmath19 .",
    "we propose that this additional mechanism is the increasing of effective disorder broadening in the parallel field due to the magneto - orbital coupling@xcite , which is particularly strong in a wide sample with well width @xmath84 .",
    "experimentally , a crude estimate of @xmath19 induced enhancement of effective disorder is given by the measurement of @xmath85 in zero perpendicular field ( @xmath86 ) . using the measured @xmath85 , we can crudely approximate the function @xmath50 in eq .",
    "[ eq : gap ] , which is taken to be unity ( @xmath47 ) so far in our analysis , to be    @xmath87    where we are making the reasonable assumption that the effective disorder scales with the measured 2d resistivity in the parallel field .",
    "experimental measurements@xcite show that @xmath88 as defined by eq .  [ eq : gap3 ] , at least for wide samples at high magnetic field .",
    "is shown by the lines , using the following parameters : @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( solid red ) ; @xmath89 , @xmath91 ( dashed blue ) ; @xmath44 , @xmath90 ( dashed green ) ; @xmath44 , @xmath91 ( dotted black ) .",
    "the disorder parameter , @xmath50 , was extracted from a second order polynomial fit to the low - field ( 0 - 6 t ) parallel field magnetoresistance @xcite . ]",
    "using the measured @xmath50 and the dingle temperature @xmath92 , as well as the measured gaps for @xmath93 , 7/2 , 1/3 , and 2/5 all from the same 40 nm wide quantum well @xcite , we show in fig.[fig:2 ] the comparison between the theoretically expected behaviour of the activation gap @xmath20 and the experimentally measured gap , as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "it is apparent that a large part of the strong decrease of @xmath21 with increasing @xmath19 can be attributed to the increasing effective disorder , as reflected by the increasing @xmath85 in the 2d system .",
    "the fact that the gap suppression as a function of @xmath19 happens not only for the enigmatic 5/2 ( and the 7/2 ) state , but also for the manifestly spin - polarized 1/3 ( and 2/5 ) state lends credence to our idea of an effective disorder induced gap suppression in an applied parallel magnetic field .",
    "we note that there is one well - known exception to the behavior shown in fig.[fig:2 ] : the 7/3 gap in a 40 nm sample increases with increasing @xmath19 as observed by two groups@xcite , and we have no explanation for this observation except to note that somehow spin - reversed excitations must play an important role for the 7/3 fqhe in this sample .",
    "+ we now comment on the important question of the implication of fig.[fig:2 ] for the issue of spin - polarization of the 5/2 fqhe . as can be seen in fig.[fig:2 ] , taking @xmath89 , _",
    "i.e. _ assuming the system to be spin - polarized ( red line ) , the effective disorder model by itself provides a reasonable explanation for the suppression of the 1/3 and 2/5 gaps by the parallel field . on the other hand , taking @xmath89 does not fully account for the suppression of the 5/2 gap ; the effective disorder with increasing @xmath50 only accounts for a fraction of the decrease of @xmath20 .",
    "this difference could arise from a @xmath19-induced zeeman contribution further weakening the gap . in fig.[fig:2 ] , we show theoretical results including the zeeman term ( dashed green ) , which tends to give better agreement between the theoretical plots and the experimental suppression of @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore conclude that for the 5/2 ( and 7/2 ) fqhe , both effective disorder and zeeman energy contribute to the observed gap suppression for @xmath48 whereas for the established spin - polarized fqhe ( @xmath94 ) , the suppression arises most likely from the enhanced disorder in a parallel field .",
    "we now comment on the importance of our theoretical modelling for the determination of the spin polarization via energy gap measurements . from the data in fig.[fig:1/3 ] , it is clear that new data for the 5/2 fqh energy gap are needed above @xmath25.5 t in order to conclude on the spin polarization from the dependence of the energy gap on the magnetic field and density .",
    "this is of paramount importance because eq.[eq : gap ] makes the simple prediction of a positive ( negative ) slope for the energy gap @xmath95 in the case of a spin polarized ( unpolarized ) state .",
    "this experiment can in principle be performed in an ultra - high mobility tunable device where the electron density @xmath54 is swept continuously in the range between @xmath26 to @xmath210 t , and the slope of the energy gap @xmath96 determined .",
    "recent experiments using optical spectroscopy @xcite have shown evidence for the 5/2 state to be spin unpolarized , up to the lowest temperature probed in these experiments .",
    "this lack of spin polarization was also found for other fqh states in the sll .",
    "if these measurements are correct , then our model predicts a maximum to occur for the energy gap of _ any _ spin unpolarized fqh states .",
    "therefore , a determination of the energy gap over a wide range of electron densities and for several fqh states in the sll is at the moment of the utmost importance in order to determine whether or not the 5/2 state is spin polarized as theory predicts it to be . +",
    "what we are emphasizing in this work is the lack of the clear monotonic increase of the measured energy gap with the magnetic field ( or carrier density ) in existing experiments as would be required for the 5/2 experimental fqhe to be spin - polarized .",
    "in fact , we believe that there is some evidence for the experimentally measured 5/2 fqh gap to be manifesting a shallow maxima as a function of magnetic field , which would be consistent with a spin - unpolarized state . only more experiments carried out on a single sample with a tunable carrier density can satisfactorily resolve this question since comparison among different samples with different densities and disorder may not be very meaningful .",
    "we do add a caveat here regarding the effect of the finite width of the sample which would affect the first term in eq.[eq : gap ] ( _ i.e. _ the function @xmath26 ) and which we have neglected so far in our consideration . if the effective 2d width of the sample is much larger than the magnetic length @xmath97 , which would happen for either very thick 2d samples or for very low magnetic fields , then the energy gap would no longer increase monotonically with the applied field in a square - root fashion , instead manifesting an almost saturation behavior with increasing field @xcite .",
    "this finite width effect would have to be taken into account in the theoretical modelling if and when experimental results measuring the 5/2 fqhe energy gap in a single density - tunable system becomes available .",
    "+ we mention finally that even if the 5/2 fqhe turns out eventually not to be completely spin - polarized , this does not necessarily imply the inapplicability of the pf wave function as the underlying description .",
    "it is possible to construct a non - abelian pf wave function for a partially spin - polarized state . in the unlikely scenario that the experimental 5/2 fqhe turns out to be completely spin - unpolarized",
    ", one would have to seriously consider abelian candidates , such as the halperin 331 strong - pairing wave function which is known to be an excellent description@xcite for the two - component even - denominator fqhe observed frequently at half - filled landau levels in bilayer systems .",
    "to conclude , we have critically analyzed the activation gap measurements for the 5/2 ( and 7/2 ) fqhe , and found that the large body of experimental gap measurements is more consistent with the 5/2 fqhe being spin - unpolarized than spin - polarized .",
    "while the question of the 5/2 spin - polarization can not be settled without a direct measurement of the spin - polarization itself , our critical analysis makes such measurements all the more urgent .",
    "a clear prediction of the present analysis is that the 5/2 activation gap for a spin unpolarized fqhe should at first increase with sample density and then decrease , manifesting a shallow maximum at some intermediate density , whereas the corresponding spin - polarized gap will manifest a monotonic increase with sample density ( until the density is high enough so that finite sample width effects come into play in affecting the inter - particle coulomb interaction ) .",
    "we also predict that the observed suppression of the 5/2 activation gap in an applied parallel magnetic field should be weaker in narrower 2d samples because of weaker magneto - orbital coupling .",
    "finally , given the great importance of the tentative conclusion about the nature of the spin - polarization of the 5/2 fqhe with fundamental consequence for its non - abelian nature , we hope that new experiments will be undertaken to resolve the nature of spin - polarization of the 5/2 fqhe state .",
