    "there is evidence that the amount of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe by far dominates that of the luminous matter .",
    "it comes from a variety of cosmological sources such as the rotation curves of galaxies  @xcite , gravitational lensing  @xcite , features of cmb  @xcite and large scale structures  @xcite .",
    "while the presence of dm is firmly established , its basic properties are still subject of a debate . if dark matter is comprised of some fundamental particle , experimentally - measured properties , such as its relic abundance or production cross - sections can be predicted .",
    "experimental measurements of the abundance @xmath4 by wmap collaboration  @xcite can be used to place constraints on the masses and interaction strengths of those dm particles .",
    "indeed , the relation @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the mass and the interaction strength associated with dm annihilation , implies that , for a weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) of dm , the mass scale should be set around the electroweak scale .",
    "yet , difficulties in understanding of small - scale gravitational clustering in numerical simulations with wimps may lead to preference being given to much lighter dm particles .",
    "particularly there has been interest in studying models of light dark matter particle with masses of the kev range  @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ relden ] ) , the light mass of dark matter particle then implies a superweak interaction between the dark matter and standard model ( sm ) sector  @xcite .",
    "several models with light @xmath8(kev - mev ) dm particles , or super - wimps , have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of the super - wimp models is that dm particles do not need to be stable against decays to even lighter sm particles  @xcite .",
    "this implies that one does not need to impose an ad - hoc @xmath9 symmetry when constructing an effective lagrangian for dm interactions with the standard model fields , so dm particles can be emitted and absorbed by sm particles . due to their extremely small couplings to the sm particles , experimental searches for super - wimps must be performed at experiments where large statistics is available . in addition , the experiments must be able to resolve signals with missing energy  @xcite .",
    "super - b factories fit this bill perfectly .",
    "in this paper we focus on bosonic super - wimp models  @xcite for dark matter candidates and attempt to constrain their couplings with the standard model through examining leptonic meson decays .",
    "the idea is quite straightforward . in the standard model the leptonic decay width of , say , a @xmath10-meson , i.e. the process @xmath11 , is helicity - suppressed by @xmath12 due to the left - handed nature of weak interactions  @xcite , @xmath13 similar formulas are available for charmed meson @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays with obvious substitution of parameters .",
    "the only non - perturbative parameter affecting eq .",
    "( [ leptrate ] ) , the heavy meson decay constant @xmath16 , can be reliably estimated on the lattice  @xcite , so the branching ratio for this process can be predicted quite reliably .",
    "the helicity suppression arises from the necessary helicity flip on the outgoing lepton due to angular momentum conservation as initial state meson is spinless .",
    "the suppression can be overcome by introducing a third particle to the final state that contributes to total angular momentum  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : feynmandiags ] ) .    if that particle is a light dm candidate , helicity suppression is traded for a small coupling strength of dm - sm interaction . in this case",
    ", the charged lepton spectrum of the 3-body @xmath17 ( with @xmath3 being the dm candidate ) process will be markedly different from the spectrum of two - body @xmath18 decay .",
    "then , the rate for the process @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being missing energy , can be used to constrain properties of light dm particles .",
    "we shall consider two examples of super - wimps , the  dark photon \" spin-1 particle , and a spin-0 , axion - like state . the discussion of the vector dark matter effects is similar to a calculation of the radiative leptonic decay  @xcite , i.e. the spin of the added dm particle brings the required unit of angular momentum . in the case of axion - like dm candidate , there is a derivative coupling to the sm allowing the pseudoscalar particle to carry orbital angular momentum and hence overcome helicity suppression as well . as a side note , we add that the models of new physics considered here are very different from the models that are usually constrained in the new physics searches with leptonic decays of heavy mesons  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ axionlike ]",
    "we examine the decay width for the process @xmath1 for @xmath21 being a spin-0 particle .",
    "we consider a particular two - higgs doublet model , taking into account dm - higgs mixing in section  [ axonhiggs ] . in section  [ vectordm ]",
    "we consider constraints on a spin-1 super - wimp candidate .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider first an  axion - like \" dark matter ( aldm ) model , as suggested in @xcite and study the tree - level interactions with the standard model fermions .",
    "the most general lagrangian consists of a combination of dimension - five operators , _ a = - | ^_5 + a f _ ^ , where @xmath21 is the dm particle and the coupling constant @xmath22 has units of mass .",
    "taking into account the chiral anomaly we can substitute the second term with a combination of vector and axial - vector fermionic currents , _ a = -(+ ) _ a   | ^_5 - i m _ ( ) a | _ 5 .",
    "the feynman diagrams that contribute to the meson decay , for example @xmath23 , are shown by fig [ fig : feynmandiags ] .",
    "the amplitude for the emission of @xmath24 in the transition @xmath25 can be written as _",
    "m|a = a_+ a_q , where @xmath26 , the quark contribution , represents emission of @xmath24 from the quarks that build up the meson and @xmath27 , the leptonic contribution , describe emission of @xmath24 from the final state leptons .",
    "let s consider the lepton amplitude first .",
    "here we can parameterize the axial matrix elements contained in the amplitude in terms of the decay constant @xmath16 such as 0| |u ^_5 b| b= i f_b p_b^ , if the mass of the axion - like dm particle is small ( @xmath28 ) , the leptonic contribution simplifies to _ = i g_f v_ub m _ ( [ |u_k ( 1-_5 ) v _ ] - [ |u_(1-_5 ) v _ ] ) . here",
    "@xmath29 is the dm momentum . clearly , this contribution is proportional to the lepton mass and can , in principle , be neglected in what follows .",
    "the contribution to the decay amplitude from the dm emission from the quark current is _",
    "q = i 0||u^b| bwhere the current @xmath30 is obtained from the diagrams in figure  [ fig : feynmandiags ] ( a ) and ( c ) , ^= v_ub .",
    "since the meson is a bound state of quarks we must use a model to describe the effective quark - antiquark distribution .",
    "we choose to follow refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , where the wave function for a ground state meson @xmath6 can be written in the form _ m = _ m(x ) _ 5 ( + m_m g_m(x ) ) . here",
    "@xmath31 is the identity in color space and @xmath32 is the momentum fraction carried by one of the quarks . for a heavy meson @xmath33 it would be convenient to assign @xmath32 as a momentum fraction carried by the heavy quark",
    "also , for a heavy meson , @xmath34 , and in the case of a light meson @xmath35 . for the distribution amplitudes of a heavy or light meson we use _ l  & ~ &  x(1-x ) , + _",

    "the matrix element can then be calculated by integrating over the momentum fraction @xcite 0||q ^q | m= ^1_0 dx  .",
    "neglecting the mass of the axion - like dm particle , the decay amplitude in the @xmath37 case simplifies to [ eqn_mesonamp ] _ q = i ( m_b _ 1^b - m_b _",
    "0^b ) , where @xmath38 is the mass of the @xmath39-quark ( or , in general , a down - type quark in the decay ) , and we defined _ n^m",

    "note that @xmath41 , which is consistent with spin - flipping transition in a quark model , which would explain why this part of the decay rate is not proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "similar results for other heavy mesons , like @xmath14 and @xmath43 are obtained by the obvious substitution of relevant parameters , such as masses , decay constants and ckm matrix elements .",
    "experimentally , the leptonic decays of heavy mesons are best studied at the @xmath44 flavor factories where a pair of @xmath45 heavy mesons are created .",
    "the study is usually done by fully reconstructing one of the heavy mesons and then by finding a candidate lepton track of opposite sign to the tagged meson .",
    "the kinematical constraints on the lepton are then used to identify the decays with missing energy as leptonic decay .    in the future super - b factories , special studies of the lepton spectrum in @xmath46missing energy",
    "can be done using this technique to constrain the dm parameters from eq .",
    "( [ btoaxion ] ) .",
    "the lepton energy distributions , which are expected to quite different for the three - body decays @xmath47 are shown ( normalized ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : aldm_lept_dist ] for each lepton decay process .",
    "however , we can put some constraints on the dm coupling parameters using the currently available data on @xmath48 .",
    "the experimental procedure outlined above implies that what is experimentally detected is the combination , [ masterformula ] _ ( m | _ )  & = & _ ( m | _ ) + _ e < e_0 de_a + & = &  _ ( m | _ ) , where @xmath49 is the energy cutoff that is specific for each experiment .",
    "equivalently , cutoff in @xmath50 can also be used . in the above formula we defined r_a ( e_0 ) = _ e < e_0 de_a .",
    "our bounds on the dm couplings from different decay modes are reported in table  [ fig : braldm ] for the cutoff values of @xmath51  mev .",
    ".constraints on @xmath22 from various decays .",
    "the last three columns represent possible soft photon pollution of @xmath48 decays for three different values of photon energy cutoff . [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     as we can see , the constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath52 are not very strong , but could be improved in the next round of experiments at super - flavor factories .",
    "we considered constraints on the parameters of different types of bosonic super - wimp dark matter from leptonic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "the main idea rests with the fact that in the standard model the two - body leptonic decay width of a heavy meson @xmath53 , or @xmath54 , is helicity - suppressed by @xmath12 due to the left - handed nature of weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "a similar three - body decay @xmath55 decay , which has similar experimental signature , is not helicity suppressed .",
