    "the quantized hall effect@xcite provides particularly interesting tests of our understanding of electrical transport .",
    "application of a resistance formula which treats all contacts to a two - dimensional electron gas on equal footing@xcite has considerably revised the traditional picture of the quantized hall effect and has led to the successful explanation of many novel experiments@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to approach the low frequency electrical transport in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) subject to strong magnetic fields from a similar point of view .",
    "in contrast to the dc - transport properties , which have become increasingly well understood , the ac - transport properties have found much less attention .",
    "however , a charge and current conserving theory for the low frequency admittance @xmath0 of a general arrangement of mesoscopic conductors has recently been worked out @xcite .",
    "we apply this theory to hall systems in the integer quantum hall regime at a plateau . a charge and current",
    "conserving theory requires knowledge of the non - equilibrium potential distribution inside the conductor . in the quantum hall regime",
    "the determination of this potential becomes simple due to the formation of edge channels @xcite .",
    "as discussed in detail by chklovskii et al.@xcite and closely related works @xcite , there occurs a decomposition of a 2des in metal - like edge channels and dielectric - like regions .",
    "consequently , the non - equilibrium potential is also determined by the properties of the edge channels . if the edge channels behave like perfect metals they screen any excess charge .",
    "the resulting non - equilibrium potential is determined by the geometry of the edge - channel arrangement alone . on the other hand ,",
    "if the charge in the edge channels is not perfectly screened the non - equilibrium potential depends on the density of states of the edge channels .",
    "the resulting potential distribution is not of geometrical nature alone but contains quantum corrections due to the finite density of states of the edge channels .",
    "it is of particular interest to investigate to what extent such quantum corrections affect the dynamic transport properties of a 2des . + the admittance @xmath1 gives the linear current response @xmath2 at a contact @xmath3 of a device , if at contact @xmath4 a voltage oscillation @xmath5 is applied : @xmath6 the voltage variation @xmath7 is related to the variation of the electro - chemical potential @xmath8 in reservoir @xmath4 by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the electron charge . the theory @xcite deals with the dc - conductance , @xmath11 , and the first - order term with respect to frequency , @xmath12 , which is called the _ emittance matrix . the low frequency admittance",
    "can then approximately be written in the form @xmath13 for an array of macroscopic conductors of which each is connected to a single contact , the emittance is just a geometrical capacitance , i.e. @xmath14 .",

    "firstly , it is not the geometrical capacitance but rather the _ electro - chemical capacitance _ which relates charges at mesoscopic conductors with voltage variations in the reservoirs .",
    "secondly , conductors which connect different reservoirs allow a transmission of charge which leads to inductance - like contributions to the emittance .",
    "+ we shall show that the emittance @xmath15 of a quantized hall sample is the sum over elements of the electro - chemical capacitance matrix , @xmath16 , for edge - channels @xmath17 into which charge is injected at contact @xmath4 and for edge - channels @xmath18 from which charge is emitted into contact @xmath3 .",
    "the electro - chemical capacitance matrix , @xmath16 , is determined by considering each edge channel as a metal strip connected to a single contact .",
    "our expression for the emittance is simple enough in order to discuss arbitrarily complicated edge - channel arrangements without much technical effort , once the electro - chemical capacitance matrix of the edge - channel arrangement is known .",
    "we emphasize here that our theory satisfies charge and current conservation which are due to a perfect screening of electric fields in the reservoirs and in the gates used to form the conductor .",
    "current conservation implies that the admittance satisfies @xmath19 .",
    "+ two simple geometries can be used to illustrate the different behavior of the emittance , namely the hall bar geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig1].a ) , and the corbino geometry ( fig . [ fig1].b ) . we will show that in a hall bar kinetic charge motion of electrons along the edge channels dominates the coulomb interaction between the reservoirs .",
    "the emittance is a negative electro - chemical capacitance , i.e. @xmath20 with @xmath21 . on the other hand , in the corbino geometry contacts",
    "are located at the inner and the outer perimeter of an annular film@xcite .",
    "hence , edge channels do not connect different reservoirs and will thus not contribute to a dc - current .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the bar geometry in the corbino disc capacitive effects dominate and the emittance is a capacitance , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "+ the transverse potential profile in a cross section of these conductors is qualitatively shown shown in fig . [ fig2 ] which is to be discussed below . here",
    "we only mention that the similarity of this potential for the two different setups applies only to the bulk of the sample .",
    "we will assume in this work that the capacitances and emittances are dominated by the bulk and that contact capacitances can be neglected .",

    "the strong magnetic field is assumed to be perpendicular to the plane of the 2des .",
    "translational invariance of the potential @xmath29 in the @xmath30-direction allows one to restrict the considerations to a transverse cross section of the sample .",

    "at the sample boundary , however , the confinement potential strongly bends up the single - particle potential which , therefore , intersects the fermi energy .",

    "it vanishes at equilibrium since at both boundaries of integration , @xmath38 holds , where @xmath39 labels the edge channels . of course , this statement is valid independent of the geometrical arrangement of the edge channels as long as the cross section is constructed such that all edge channels of a contact are included . in particular , it is independent of the specific space dependence of the equilibrium potential which can be very complicated .",
    "+ the inclusion of coulomb interaction , even within a mean - field approximation , drastically affects the results of the single - particle approach .",
    "coulomb interactions lead to an electro - static restructuring of the edge @xcite .",
    "the 2des is composed of alternating strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquids with finite widths .",
    "incompressible regions where the filling factor has discrete values behave like dielectrics .",
    "quantitative analytical predictions of the widths of the compressible and incompressible strips have been made by chklovskii et al.@xcite .",

    "the strength of the confinement field depends on the specific fabrication of the boundaries of the 2des under consideration ( etching , gates , etc . ) .",

    "interaction - dominated edge channels are useful in the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite . however , the structure of fractional edge channels is much more complicated , and we shall restrict our considerations to the integer quantum hall regime . +    in the following considerations , three quantities which characterize the equilibrium state of a sample are important in order to discuss low frequency transport close to equilibrium .",
    "first , the density of states , @xmath43 , of the edge channel @xmath18 at the fermi level gives the change in the number of states if the electro - chemical potential is varied for fixed electrostatic potential ( i.e. fixed band bottom ) .",
    "for non - interacting electrons this density of states is determined by the ( equilibrium ) velocity of carriers @xmath44 along the the path @xmath45 of the edge channel , where @xmath31 is now the transverse coordinate .",
    "it is given by @xmath46 , where the integral over @xmath45 is along the entire path of the edge channel from one sample contact to the other .",
    "for the interacting model this density of states diverges at @xmath47 since the single particle potential is flat . but the density of states is finite for any non - vanishing temperature .",
    "a finite dos of edge channels due to a considerable suppression of screening at small temperatures is indicated by the numerical results presented by lier and gerhardts@xcite .",
    "+ secondly , one can attribute to the arrangement of metal - like edge channels a geometrical capacitance matrix @xmath48 . for given geometry",
    ", this matrix can in principle be derived with the help of poisson s equation .",
    "for metallic screening this capacitance matrix is determined by the width and location of the edge channels .",
    "it is , therefore , also a function of the magnetic field and the electro - chemical potentials applied to the contacts and the gates @xcite .",
    "+ we finally take into account that each edge channel connects reservoirs in a directed way , due to the uni - directional velocity of the carriers .",
    "this connection is determined by the transmission and reflection probability of the contact . in the following",
    ", we shall always regard the just mentioned characteristics of the equilibrium state to be given .",
    "consider the two - terminal bar of fig .",
    "[ fig1].a under nonequilibrium conditions .",

    "[ fig2].b .",
    "a small increase of the voltage @xmath7 at contact @xmath4 , say @xmath49 , implies an electro - chemical voltage shift @xmath50 in channel @xmath18 .",
    "if the transmission probability from the contact into the edge channel is @xmath51 , then the chemical potential shift of that edge channel is the same as that of the reservoir @xmath52 as a consequence , into the edge channel a charge is injected which is proportional to the density of states ( dos ) @xmath43 of the edge channel @xmath18 .",
    "this added charge creates in the whole sample an electric nonequilibrium potential which shifts the band bottom .",
    "this leads , in turn , to the injection of screening charge . the total charge @xmath53 in edge channel @xmath18 is then given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the quantum capacitance of edge channel @xmath18 .",
    "the nonequilibrium electric potential @xmath56 of edge channel @xmath18 can be calculated for a given charge distribution by solving the electrostatic boundary - value problem associated with poisson s equation .",

    "note , that the @xmath59 are calculated for edge channels which are _ disconnected _ from the contacts and where charge is not conserved .",
    "but the relevant ( gauge invariant ) potentials are the electro - chemical potentials and not the electrostatic potentials of disconnected edge channels .",
    "we define thus an electro - chemical capacitance matrix @xmath60 by @xcite @xmath61 considering charge conservation , @xmath62 , which is due to the connection to the reservoirs .",
