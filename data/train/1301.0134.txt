    "the construction of such a transformation can be realized by the cutting and stacking method  @xcite , @xcite ( chapter  7 ) , which visually can be described as a series of refining constructions : at stage @xmath14 we have a rokhlin tower @xmath15 whose base @xmath16 , visualized as an interval , is then divided into @xmath17 equal subintervals , giving rise to @xmath17 columns of @xmath12 which are numbered from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . for each @xmath20 , above column @xmath21 , we add @xmath22 spacers , then stack columns with added spacers one above another to obtain @xmath13 , where the dynamics is to jump by one level up .",
    "assuming that the first tower is reduced to a single level @xmath23 , as we can always do without loss of generality , the construction of the rank - one automorphism is then completely described by the sequences of parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "when all different positive ( prime ) powers of an automorphism @xmath2 are disjoint , sarnak s conjecture holds for every uniquely ergodic topological model of @xmath2 .",

    "he proves some kind of spectral disjointness for different prime numbers rescalings of generalized riesz products describing the maximal spectral type of a rank - one transformation .",
    "this kind of spectral disjointness turns out to be sufficient to obtain a basic mbius orthogonality lemma proved in  @xcite .",
    "as indicated in  @xcite , the positive answer to sarnak s conjecture in the class of all rank - one transformations would give automatically the positive answer to sarnak s conjecture for almost every interval exchange transformations ( see  @xcite for rank - one property of almost every iet ) .",
    "in  @xcite the 3-iet case is considered .",
    "we first develop in section  [ sec : spectral_results ] the purely spectral part of our argument .",
    "spectral disjointness of powers of a unitary operator @xmath64 with continuous maximal spectral type is derived from the existence , in the weak closure of @xmath65 , of `` sufficiently many '' analytic functions of the operator @xmath64 , with a suitable control of their coefficients ( see in particular corollary  [ clb2 ] ) .",
    "then we prove that for a large class of rank - one constructions , we can find appropriate weak limits in the weak closure of @xmath0 to get spectral disjointness ( on the continuous part of the spectrum ) of different positive powers .",
    "in particular , we consider so - called _ bounded _ rank - one constructions , which simply means that all parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 are uniformly bounded ( but here we impose no special restriction on the last column , so that the number of consecutive spacers is not necessarily bounded , as spacers coming from different steps of the construction can accumulate ) .",
    "more generally , we deal with the following generalization of the class of bounded rank - one transformations : the cutting and stacking parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 being given , we say that the rank - one construction is _ recurrent _ if we can find an increasing subsequence @xmath68 and bi - infinite sequences @xmath69 of positive integers and @xmath70 such that , for all @xmath71 and all @xmath72 , @xmath73 { } } \\pi_m , \\quad\\mbox{and } s_{n_k+m , j } { \\xrightarrow[k\\to\\infty ] { } } \\eta_{m , j}.\\ ] ] such a subsequence @xmath68 will henceforth be called a _ stabilizing subsequence_.",
    "the rank - one construction is said to be _ bounded - recurrent _ if we can find a stabilizing subsequence for which the limit parameters @xmath74 are uniformly bounded ( we do not require in this definition the boundedness of the parameters @xmath75 ) .    to obtain appropriate weak limits in the bounded - recurrent case , we use the integral representation over odometer model introduced in  @xcite for rank - one automorphisms , and a general theorem describing weak limits in this setting ( theorem  [ dflp ] ) .",
    "this , together with a ",
    "non - flatness \" condition gives the spectral disjointness on the continuous part of the spectrum for different positive powers of a bounded - recurrent rank - one construction ( theorem  [ thm : spectral - disjointness ] ) .",
    "we also prove in section  [ sec : unbounded ] that our method for proving the spectral disjointness of the powers can also work in classical rank - one examples where @xmath76{}}\\infty$ ] , which of course prohibits the existence of stabilizing subsequences .",
    "we consider here the family of rigid generalized chacon s maps , and katok s map .    in section  [ sec : symbolic ] , we are concerned with the application of our spectral disjointness results to sarnak s conjecture in the symbolic model associated to a given rank - one construction . here",
    "two kinds of difficulties appear : first , these symbolic models are not in general uniquely ergodic , and we will need an extra combinatorial argument ( proposition  [ prop : structure of names ] ) to deal with the other possible ergodic invariant measure ( the dirac mass on a fixed point ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : sarnak for symbolic wm ] shows that , at the cost of an extra hypothesis on the control of the parameters @xmath67 ( which is automatically fulfilled in the bounded case ) , we can prove sarnak s conjecture in spite of the lack of unique ergodicity .",
    "second , since we only get spectral disjointness on the continuous part of the spectrum , we have to take into account the possible eigenvalues .",
    "we treat the case of a finite cyclic group of eigenvalues , which can arise in bounded rank- one constructions .",
    "we finally get sarnak s conjecture for the symbolic model of any bounded rank - one contruction ( theorem  [ thm : sarnak for bounded rank one ] ) , provided this symbolic model is well defined ( that is to say , provided the automorphism is not isomorphic to an odometer ) .      the authors would like to thank j .-",

    "<S> we study the spectral disjointness of the powers of a rank - one transformation . for a large class of rank - one constructions , including those for which the cutting and stacking parameters are bounded , and other examples such as rigid generalized chacon s maps and katok s map , we prove that different positive powers of the transformation are pairwise spectrally disjoint on the continuous part of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our proof involves the existence , in the weak closure of @xmath0 , of `` sufficiently many '' analytic functions of the operator @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> then we apply these disjointness results to prove sarnak s conjecture for the ( possibly non - uniquely ergodic ) symbolic models associated to these rank - one constructions : all sequences realized in these models are orthogonal to the mbius function . </S>"
