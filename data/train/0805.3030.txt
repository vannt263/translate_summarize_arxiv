    "this claim was not proved and later retracted by the authors .",
    "it is a monad up to homotopy , as was proved in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prove that these homotopies are part of a system of higher coherent homotopies , turning @xmath5 into what we call an _ @xmath2-monad_. in fact we work in a wider context .",
    "let @xmath6 be a category which is complete and cocomplete , tensored and cotensored over a `` convenient '' category @xmath7 of topological spaces in the sense of steenrod @xcite  see section [ s : enriched - categories ] .",
    "assume further that @xmath6 has an enriched monoidal structure @xmath8 with unit @xmath9 .",
    "for a ( non - symmetric ) operad @xmath0 of topological spaces , an _",
    "@xmath0-algebra _ in @xmath10 is an object @xmath11 which is equipped with appropriate @xmath0-algebra structure maps @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath0 is the associative operad @xmath13 with @xmath14 for all @xmath15 , an @xmath0-algebra is just a monoid in @xmath10 and therefore has an associated cobar construction @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "its totalization @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the category of ordered sets @xmath20=\\{0,\\dots , n\\}$ ] and monotonic maps , is called the _ completion _ of @xmath21 .",
    "this construction can be generalized to arbitrary @xmath0-algebras , as we will show in section  [ sec - a - monads - completion ] below .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following completion theorem :    [ completion - theorem ] for any operad @xmath0 there exists an operad @xmath22 mapping to @xmath0 with the following property : if @xmath21 is an @xmath0-algebra in @xmath10 then @xmath23 is an @xmath22-algebra and @xmath24 is a morphism of @xmath22-algebras . if @xmath0 is an @xmath2-operad then so is @xmath22 .",
    "our principal application of this theorem is when @xmath6 is the ( large ) category of continuous endofunctors of a complete and cocomplete category @xmath1 tensored and cotensored over @xmath7 , with the monoidal structure given by composition of functors .",
    "see section [ ss : endofunctorcat ] below for more details , particularly about the set - theoretic difficulties involved .",
    "a monoid @xmath21 in this category is simply a monad , and an @xmath0-algebra is what we call an _ @xmath0-monad _ on @xmath1 . if the spaces of @xmath0 are weakly contractible we call @xmath21 an @xmath2-monad .",
    "the resolution @xmath25 and the completion @xmath26 generalize the classical definitions given by bousfield and kan in @xcite for monads associated to commutative rings .",
    "thus we obtain as an immediate corollary of the theorem :    [ completion - corollary ] let @xmath21 be an @xmath0-monad in @xmath1 . then @xmath23 is an @xmath22-monad and @xmath27 is a morphism of @xmath22-monads .",
    "if @xmath21 is an @xmath2-monad , then so is @xmath26 .",
    "for example , the theorem works in the following setting :    * the functor @xmath28 for an @xmath2-ring spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath29 is ordinary homology with coefficients in a ring @xmath4 then @xmath26 is a topological version of the bousfield - kan @xmath4-completion . for more general @xmath29 ,",
    "it is the bendersky - thompson completion @xcite . * the functor @xmath26 for an @xmath2-monad @xmath21 .",
    "the output of the theorem , namely @xmath26 , can be fed back into it to obtain @xmath30 . in particular ,",
    "if we start with a completion at a homology theory @xmath29 as above , we get a secondary multiplicative bousfield spectral sequence whose @xmath31-term consists of the homotopy groups of iterated completions of a space , and which converges to the homotopy groups of the completion at @xmath26 , namely @xmath32 + following dror and dwyer in @xcite , the completion procedure can be iterated transfinitely to obtain a `` long tower '' @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath29 is the ordinary homology with coefficients in @xmath34 or a subring of @xmath35 , they have shown that if we iterate this often enough , the spectral sequence will eventually converge to the homotopy groups of @xmath36 , the localization .",
    "it would be very interesting to know if this works for any homology theory @xmath29 .",
    "* the same construction works in the category of spectra , where the monad is given by @xmath37 for an @xmath2-spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "the theorem allows us to construct a secondary adams spectral sequence with @xmath38-term constructed from the homotopy groups of the iterated @xmath29-nilpotent completion and converging to the homotopy groups of a second - order completion . in this way , just as for spaces , a long tower of spectra under the @xmath29-localization can be constructed , with a higher adams spectral sequence relating every tower stage to the following one .",
    "the crux of the theorem is the assertion that @xmath22 is an @xmath2-operad if @xmath0 is one .",
    "thus , the completion of a monad is not a monad , but the completion of a monad up to coherent homotopies turns out to be a monad of the same type .",
    "we remark that if @xmath6 is enriched over @xmath39 , the category of simplicial sets , the construction of the operad @xmath22 and its action on @xmath23 in sections [ sec - a - monads - completion][restriced - operad - section ] work without any change .",
    "however , it is not true that @xmath22 is an @xmath2-operad of simplicial sets if @xmath0 has the same property ( see theorem  [ thm - hata - contractible ] . ) for this reason we will only be interested in enrichment over @xmath7 .    in the companion paper @xcite",
    "we show that a related result , stronger in some sense and weaker in another , holds in the simplicial world .",
    "we show there that if the monad under consideration is the free @xmath4-module functor for a ring @xmath4 then there is an explicit , combinatorially defined @xmath2-operad action on the cobar construction , not just its totalization .",
    "it is worth noting that when @xmath10 is @xmath40 or any other monoidal category where @xmath9 is a terminal object then for any @xmath2-algebra @xmath21 , @xmath25 has a cosimplicial retraction to @xmath9 and thus @xmath41 .",
    "the theorem is thus only making a trivial statement .",
    "the purpose of this section is to set up some notation and recall various easy facts about enriched categories .",
    "most of the facts can be found in the literature , e.g. @xcite , and are collected here for the reader s convenience .",
    "let @xmath7 denote a complete and cocomplete `` convenient '' category of topological spaces in the sense of steenrod @xcite .",
