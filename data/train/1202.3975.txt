    "the term correlation has come to represent all electronic or quasi - particle interactions that go beyond a simple single slater determinant description .",
    "it can be divided into two parts , classical and quantum correlation .",
    "the former gives rise to mixed states , and the latter to entangled states .",
    "the four different combinations of classical and quantum correlation result in the following classifications of an n - electron state in terms of wave - functions and density operators @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the vacuum state .",
    "here @xmath58 and @xmath59 are sets of probabilities normalized to one , and @xmath60 are expansion coefficients .",
    "the vectorial indices @xmath61 and @xmath62 are composed of the ordered components @xmath63 and @xmath64 referring to a generic one - particle basis .",
    "for example the state @xmath65 corresponds to a many body index @xmath66 .",
    "classical correlations can derive from physical processes , e.g. thermal decoherence , but also be induced by a local projection upon some set of orbitals , e.g. the d- or f - orbitals of single atom in a solid . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a set orbitals @xmath67 labelled by the indices @xmath68 , and define the operator subspaces @xmath69 the full hilbert space @xmath70 can be partitioned as @xmath71 where @xmath72 the local projection of a pure state @xmath73 upon @xmath67 is obtained by taking the partial trace over @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the locally projected state @xmath77 is in general a mixed state , unless @xmath78 is idempotent .",
    "it becomes harder to distinguish two states after a local projection since some information is lost in the partial trace over @xmath74 . for example , the highly mixed state @xmath15 , the pure and separable state @xmath25 , and the pure entangled state @xmath79 given by @xmath80 become indistinguable after a local projection onto the orbitals 1 and 2 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is therefore in general not possible to draw any conclusions about the classical or quantum correlations in the original unprojected state from its local projection .",
    "quantum correlations can stem from physical electron - electron interaction , e.g. coulomb interaction , or be induced by a non - local projection .",
    "a non - local projection is qualitatively different from a local projection in that it projects onto a set of many - body states , and not a set of orbitals .",
    "the entanglement of the projected state may be larger than that of the original state .",
    "a trivial example is when the non - local projection is defined with respect to a single entangled state @xmath14 , as any separable state with a non - zero overlap with @xmath14 becomes entangled after the projection .",
    "a less trivial example is given by the projection operator @xmath82 the projection with @xmath83 makes the pure separable spin - coherent state @xmath84 entangled .",
    "in contrast to the first example it should be noted that @xmath83 projects onto two separable states .",
    "moreover , the projection itself corresponds to a simple stern - gerlach experiment of a spin-1 particle with a single slit to remove the spin @xmath85 components .",

    "it is easy to visualize the search for the optimal @xmath89 as an extremization of the intermediate intensities at each step in the measurement process .",

    "can be represented as a single slater determinant .",
    "its natural orbitals are therefore either completely occupied or empty , and the algorithm will return an overlap equal to one . the latter case can be proved by noting that the first electron removal leads to a state with one single electron , which is necessarily separable . hence , no intensity will be lost in the second measurement , which implies that the maximal overlap is equal to the maximal probability of successfully removing the first electron .",
    "a reason the recursive search algorithm is not exact for systems with three or more electrons is that the optimal state is not always a superposition of pair - wise entangled states .",
    "this can be illustrated by applying a spin ladder operator to a maximally spin - polarized separable 3-electron state @xmath102 , giving @xmath103 the three slater determinants on the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sp3 ] ) are all pair - wise entangled , which implies that the corresponding reduced one - particle density matrix @xmath104 is diagonal .",
    "if the slater search algorithm is applied to this state it will therefore keep the current basis and yield a maximal squared overlap of 1/3 .",
    "however , the unitary spin transformation @xmath105 gives @xmath106 the first slater determinant on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sptrans ] ) has a squared overlap of 4/9 , which is larger than the overlap of 1/3 found for the untransformed basis .",
