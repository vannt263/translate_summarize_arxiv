    "surface growth processes and deposition of thin films are of great interest due to potential technological applications ( such as production of nanostructures for microelectronic devices , the possibility of growth of designed quantum objects , magnetic storage devices , among others ) and due to the fundamental role these systems play in non - equilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "several models have been investigated in the last decade , most of them involving one kind of particle and a simple microscopic aggregation rule .",
