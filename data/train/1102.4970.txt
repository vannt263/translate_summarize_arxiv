    "in recent years , considerable experimental and theoretical efforts have been undertaken to understand the physics of hadrons containing a heavy quark @xcite.the isgur - wise function @xcite is an important quantity in this area of hadron physics.it is in this spirit , that this function has been studied in various quark models @xcite@xcite besides qcd sum rule approach @xcite , the mit bag model @xcite and the skryme model @xcite . + since one of the basic ingredients of the iw function is the hadron wavefunction involving heavy quark @xcite@xcite , it is therefore meaningful to test any specific qcd inspired quark model by calculating the iw function and study it phenomenologically .",
    "+ sometimes back , a specific qcd inspired quark model was proposed by us @xcite which had later been used to calculate iw function as well @xcite .",
    "+ one of drawback of the model is that significant confinement effect could not be accomodated in the model@xcite due to perturbative constraints coming from using the dalgarno s method @xcite.only recently @xcite , standard confinement effect @xmath1 @xcite was accomodated in the improved version of qcd inspired quark model brought through the introduction of parameter @xmath0 in the potential : @xmath3 taking @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 as its natural scale fixing and @xmath7 = @xmath8 where @xmath7 is an undetermined factor appearing in the series solution of the schrdinger equation [ eq.(8 ) of ref.19].in earlier works@xcite , the unknown coefficient @xmath9 occured in the wavefunction was set to zero .",
    "+ one of the drawback of work [ 19]was the adhoc enhancement of strong coupling constant was needed to take into account of the slope and curvature of @xmath2,@xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons .",
    "+ in this work , we take an alternative strategy to remove this adhoc enhancement.we use the wavefunction at the origin involving the unknown coefficient @xmath9 and fix it from the experimental values of masses and decay constants directly.the reality constraint on @xmath9 will then yeild lower bounds on the strong coupling constant @xmath12 , which would lead to the upper bounds on the slope and curvature of the iw function . +",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : section 2 contains the theory of the improved qcd inspired quark model , section 3 encloses the results and in section 4 we draw conclusion and remarks .",
    "the spin independent fermi - breit hamiltonian for ground state ( @xmath13),neglecting the contact term proportional to @xmath14 is @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath12 is the running coupling constant , @xmath16 is the confinememt parameter and @xmath4 is another parameter whose significance will be cleared later .",
    "+ in this work , the @xmath12 values are taken from the v -scheme @xcite as done in @xcite which are large as compared to those of @xmath17-scheme.it is necessary as large @xmath12 values lead to better results for slope and curvature of isgur - wise function in earlier work @xcite .",
    "+ in earlier work @xcite , large confinement was found to be inconvenient in the calculation of slope and curvature of isgur -wise function which was a limitation of the model.so , our aim has been focussed in the inclusion of larger confinement and hence we retain the same choice of @xmath1 @xcite to investigate whether this approach leads to better results or not.it is worth notable that inclusion of @xmath4 in the analysis @xcite allows larger @xmath16 useful , so we do nt think another choice of @xmath16 .",
    "+ with , @xmath18 as the parent hamiltonian and @xmath19 as the perturbed hamiltonian , we obtain a ground state wavefunction upto the first order correction using the dalgarno method @xcite of stationary state perturbation theory as : + @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the unknown coefficient appearing in the series solution of the dalgarno method + including the relativistic effect @xcite , the wavefunction is : + @xmath22    here @xmath23 is given by : + @xmath24    and + @xmath25    @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the normalization constants given by : + @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is given in appendix a. + we note that the equations ( 2),(3),(6)and ( 7 ) are obtained from eq.(4),(6),(5 ) and ( 7 ) of ref.[19 ] exhibiting explicit dependence of @xmath9 in them .      the wavefunction at the origin ( wfo ) , is related to the decay constant @xmath32 and the mass of the pseudoscalar meson @xmath33 through the relation @xcite : + @xmath34    again from equation ( 2 ) , we have : + @xmath35\\ ] ] using equation(6 ) , we arrive at the quadratic equation for @xmath9 : @xmath36 where + @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39-\\frac{1}{\\pi a_{0}^{3}}\\ ] ] using the experimental values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite , we determine @xmath40 from equation(9 ) which in turn will yeild two solutions for @xmath9 in equation ( 10 ) : @xmath41 which will depend on @xmath42,@xmath43,@xmath44 and @xmath12.the solution corresponding to the + ve(-ve ) sign of equation(15)will be termed as + ve(-ve ) solution hereafter.it will be shown numerically that for a given @xmath42 , @xmath43,and @xmath44 , @xmath12 reaches the minimum value when the following condition is satisfied : @xmath45 the formalism involving eq.(5)-(16 ) is strictly valid only without relativistic effect as the wavefunction at the origin with such effect [ eq.(3 ) ] is not well defined due to its singularity at the origin.for a subsequent analysis , we assume that @xmath9 does not deviate significantly from its non - relativistic value so that it can be used to calculate the slope and curvature of the iw function even without relativistic effect",

    "+ we conclude this paper with a comment on the physical significance of the factor @xmath0 that has become so crucial for our analysis of bounds on slope and curvature . + it is common wisdom that a constant potential like @xmath0 just scales the energies and doesnot affect the wavefunction nor does it change physics.this can be seen from the hydrogen atom problem with the potential @xmath83.however , if one uses @xmath0 as the perturbation instead of as parent in the dalgarno method of perturbation theory @xcite , the wavefunction for the @xmath84-atom becomes : + @xmath85 + to be compared with the wavefunction with @xmath0 as parent : + @xmath86 + where the normalization constant : + @xmath87 + thus , the perturbative child @xmath0 rather than the parent @xmath0 plays the crucial role in the present analysis . +    1 m. neubert , phys rep 245,259 ( 1994 ) + n isgur and m b wise phys lett b 232,113 ( 1989 ) + b.holdom,m .",
