    "interest in low dimensional systems with dimerization has greatly increased in recent years due to several experimental findings .",

    "further motivation for the interest comes with the discovery of a spin - peierls transition in the dimerized , weakly coupled , ladder system , cugeo@xmath4 @xcite which now has a well determined magnetic structure @xcite . finally , the recent discovery that the ladder system , sr@xmath8ca@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath11 , becomes a superconductor at 12 k and 3 gpa @xcite has renewed the idea , originally suggested by anderson @xcite , that spin chain dynamics is linked with the mechanism of high-@xmath12 superconductivity .",
    "the interest in systems with dimerization is not restricted to the 1d case .",
    "there are a number of 2d theoretical models with induced or spontaneous dimerization , such as the two - layer heisenberg model ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , dimerized heisenberg models @xcite and the @xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "some of the models can be relevant to real materials @xcite .",
    "a very important question relevant to any disordered quantum spin system is : what are the elementary excitations of the system ?",
    "until recently , common wisdom was that there are two possibilities : 1 ) elementary excitations have spin 1 ( elementary triplets ) or 2 ) elementary excitations have spin @xmath13 ( spinons ) .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "however , now it is becoming clear that the spectrum of excitations of disordered quantum spin systems is much more complicated .",
    "the spin @xmath13 1d heisenberg chain is a very important example of a pure spinon excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "some generalizations of this model , such as the frustrated heisenberg chain , also have pure spinon excitations .",
    "however , introduction of external dimerization changes the spectrum drastically : the spinons become confined and the spectrum consists of multiple singlet and triplet states @xcite . on the other hand , at very strong dimerizations , one would expect pure triplet excitations .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "it has been demonstrated that there are multiple bound states of the triplet excitations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bound state can sometimes have energies very close to the `` elementary triplet '' , as in the 2d @xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the spectra of quantum spin systems is somewhat similar to the complexity of the meson spectra in quantum chromodynamics . in reality , the physics is also very similar .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to investigate the excitation spectra of the spin systems which are close to deconfinement of spinons . as a building block we use the frustrated @xmath1 spin @xmath13 chain near the majumdar - ghosh point ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "spinons are deconfined in this model .",
    "the models we consider have bound states of arbitrarily large size , meaning that they are close to deconfinement .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider a @xmath0 chain at @xmath15 .",
    "following the approaches suggested by affleck @xcite and uhrig et al@xcite we calculate singlet - triplet splittings and spin structure factors ( quasiparticle residues for triplet excitations ) .",
    "in section iii we consider two coupled @xmath1 chains ( a ladder ) .",
    "the most interesting part here is the tunneling of the spinon from one leg of the ladder to another . in section",
    "iv we consider two - dimensional array of the @xmath1 chains .",
    "we calculate the confinement radius and demonstrate that the low energy dispersion of the triplet excitation is isotropic .",
    "section v presents our conclusions .",

    "we set @xmath19 , @xmath20 and denote the degree of dimerization as @xmath21 .",
    "consider first the case of zero explicit dimerization @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that at @xmath23 @xcite there is a unique ground state and that the excitation spectrum is gapless . on the other hand , at @xmath24 , the ground state",
    "has spontaneous dimerization and is therefore doubly degenerate , with a gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "it has been shown by majumdar , ghosh and van den broek @xcite that , at @xmath25 , all quantum fluctuations are canceled out and the ground state is particularly simple : the product of exact spin dimers , @xmath26\\left[j , j+1\\right ] \\left[j+2,j+3\\right]\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,\\,.\\ ] ] where we denote the singlet pair formed from adjacent sites , @xmath18 and @xmath27 , by @xmath28 $ ] . the singlet chain shifted by unity with respect to eq .",
