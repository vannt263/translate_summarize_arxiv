    "how can we approximate it ?",
    "though each geodesic triangle and its boundary curve determine the direction of each horizontal displacement , some linear ordering of geodesic triangles and the induced ordering of their boundary curves may not represent the boundary curve of their union .",

    "though the different orderings of triangles give different curves in the vertical space , they will meet at the same ending point .",
    "so , with respect to any ordering , the horizontal displacement of the boundary curve of the given disk can be approximated .",

    "something similar could be done if the fiber so(n ) were abelian , which would make the ending points of any other different two curves in the fiber , induced from different linear orderings , be the same .",
    "but the fiber so(n ) is not abelian for @xmath29 .",
    "the difficult part is that not only the approximation of the area but also the linear ordering of the triangles on each step for the approximation of the boundary curve of the disk should be considered at the same time .",
    "this is one of the hardest parts in this paper , which is dealt with in section  [ sec : strategy ] and appendices  [ sec : triangles ] and  [ sec : curves ] .",
    "furthermore , can holonomy displacements by the lifts of piecewise geodesics approaching to the boundary of the given topological disk in the base space converge to the holonomy displacement by the lift of the boundary ?",
    "it will be discussed in subsection [ sec - converge - lift ] .",
