    "a growing number of theoretical and experimental works have showed that the high-@xmath1 superconducting pairing has @xmath12 symmetry @xcite .",

    "the intrinsic linear-@xmath3 behavior of @xmath13 was first observed in a twinned @xmath14 single crystal @xcite and was one of the earliest pieces of evidence for the @xmath5-wave symmetry of the gap parameter .",
    "the linear-@xmath3 behavior of @xmath13 has now been established in both chain and nonchain copper oxides , which include optimally doped or underdoped @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath21-axis penetration depth has also been measured in a variety of high-@xmath1 compounds , such as @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 and @xmath23 @xcite . a common feature revealed in all measurements",
    "is that the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath21-axis penetration depth is much weaker than its in - plane counterpart at low @xmath3 .",
    "it has been found that @xmath24 approaches to its zero temperature value as a power law , namely @xmath25 , with @xmath26 oftern being sample dependent and generally greater than 1 .",
    "understanding why the temperature dependence of @xmath27 in high-@xmath1 superconductors is much weaker than @xmath13 is not a trivial problem .",
    "straighforward extension of the 2d @xmath5-wave model to anisotropic 3d leads to line nodes on a warped cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "this gives a strong linear-@xmath3 c - axis response in apparent contradiction to experiment .",
    "the weak @xmath3 dependence of @xmath27 is actually an intrinsic feature of htsc . as shown by xiang and wheatley @xcite , it is due to the interplay between the @xmath5-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter and the underlying cu @xmath28-orbital - based electronic structure of copper oxides . for high-@xmath1 compounds with tetragonal symmetry , they predicted @xcite that in the clean limit @xmath27 should behave as @xmath6 at low @xmath3 .",
    "recently this @xmath6 behavior was observed experimentally in the single layer hg - compound by panagopoulos et al @xcite . as in the case of @xmath13 ,",
    "impurity scattering can have a strong impact on the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "in the temperature regime where impurity scattering is important , @xmath27 generally behaves as @xmath10 or @xmath29 , depending on the type and strength of the scattering potentials @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the normal state of htsc is a non - fermi liquid .",
    "however , in the superconducting state , the behavior of high-@xmath1 materials does not deviate significantly from that of conventional metallic superconductors except the different pairing symmetry",
    ". moreover , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments @xcite show that bcs quasiparticle excitations exist at @xmath30 .",
    "thus it is generally agreed that the bcs theory is applicable to htsc at least at low @xmath3 .    to understand the interlayer dynamics in the superconducting phase ,",
    "a key issue which needs to be clarified is whether the interlayer hopping of superconducting quasiparticles is coherent or incoherent . in normal states",
    "the @xmath21-axis mean free path is short compared with the @xmath21-axis lattice constant .",
    "the semiconducting behavior of the out - of - plane normal state resistivity @xmath31 has generally been taken as evidence that the @xmath21-axis transport can not be described by conventional three dimensional coherent block transport .",
    "microwave @xcite and thermal hall measurements @xcite , however , revealed that the mean free path increases by more than six orders of magnitude in the superconducting state .",
    "the superconducting quasiparticle scattering rate is therefore much lower than the extrapolated normal state scattering rate .",
    "thus it is our belief that excited quasiparticles form coherent bloch band along the @xmath21 axis in the superconducting state at low @xmath3 . for @xmath16 or other extremely anisotropic compounds ,",
    "the coherent tunneling is small and the @xmath21-axis superfluid response might still be dominated by the impurity assisted hopping @xcite .",
    "however , for other compounds with tetragonal crystal symmetry and lower anisotropy , we believe that the coherent band should give a substantial contribution to the @xmath21-axis superfluid response function .",
    "this paper arranges as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] a general formula for the superfluid response function is derived from standard linear response theory . in sec .",

    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] summarizes the results .",
    "according to the london equation , the superfluid density is inversely proportional to the square of the penetration depth . from linear response theory @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that the superfluid tensor is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes a thermal average , @xmath34 is the band energy of electrons , and @xmath35 is the current operator .",
    "@xmath36 is the volume of the system . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses of quasiparticles to an external field , respectively . generally @xmath37 is weakly temperature dependent but @xmath38 is strongly temperature dependent . for a spherical energy band , @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath40 is temperature independent , where @xmath26 is the electron concentration . above @xmath1",
    ", the contribution from @xmath38 cancels that from @xmath37 , leading to a zero superfluid density . below @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath38 decreases with decreasing temperature .    in the weak coupling bcs theory , eqs .",
    "( [ eqkinetic ] ) and ( [ eqlambda ] ) can be simplified to @xmath41 for a single band system . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 is the gap order parameter . for an anisotropic @xmath5-wave superconductor with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath48 up to the leading order approximation of @xmath3 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath7 is different than @xmath50 because of the anisotropy , but the normalized superfluid density @xmath51 is approximately the same in all three directions .",
    "the linear @xmath3 dependence of @xmath0 is a direct consequence of the linear low energy density of states of a @xmath5-wave superconductor .",
    "the linear @xmath3 dependence of @xmath50 in this anisotropic system is consistent with experimental results of htsc .",
    "however , the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath7 given by eq .",
    "( [ sc_ani ] ) is too strong compared with experiments , which indicates that this simple model of an anisotropic @xmath5-wave superconductor is insufficient to account for the experimental data .",
    "in this section , we discuss the properties of the electronic structure of htsc and analyse why @xmath7 has a weaker @xmath3 dependence than @xmath2 .",
    "we consider first the tetragonal ( or almost tetragonal ) htsc , and then @xmath11 materials . in @xmath52 , where two neighboring cuo chain layers are offset by @xmath53 , the coupling between two neighboring cuo chain layers is therefore very different from that between a cuo layer and a cuo@xmath54 layer .",
    "to understand the properties of @xmath0 of @xmath52 , a proximity @xmath55 model should be considered , where @xmath56 represents a cuo@xmath54 layer , @xmath57 a cuo layer , and @xmath58 represents a unit cell which is offset by @xmath53 along the @xmath59-axis with respect to its neighboring unit cell @xmath60 . at present a detailed study for this complicated @xmath55 model has not been made .",
    "the electronic structure of high-@xmath1 oxides is mainly determined by the o @xmath61 , @xmath62 and cu @xmath63 , @xmath64 orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the wavefunctions of the first three orbitals extend mainly along the short cu - o bond axes , leading to a large cu - o hopping integral in the @xmath65 plane .",
    "the o @xmath66 can be classified as bonding and non - bonding wannier orbitals according to their interaction with cu 3@xmath5 orbitals .",
    "the non - bonding o @xmath66 orbital , which has a zero wavefunction overlap with cu @xmath28 , is believed to be filled and has little effect on the low @xmath3 transport properties of cuprates .",
    "thus only the bonding o orbitals need be considered . in the limit of strong coulomb repulsion ,",
    "each doped hole on the bonding o @xmath66 orbital will form a local zhang - rice spin singlet with a cu spin @xcite .",
    "the low energy physics of high-@xmath1 oxides is governed by this singlet band .",
    "the cu @xmath64 has a much higher energy than the fermi level .",
    "however , it is important for the interlayer hopping of holes @xcite , since the interlayer hopping is mainly assisted by the cu @xmath64 orbitals .",
    "it also has a large contribution to the 2nd and 3rd nearest neighbor ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) intra - plane hopping integrals .",
    "( 6 , 6 ) ( 4,0 )    the interlayer hopping of holes is accomplished through the following virtual hopping processes @xcite : a hole first hops from an o 2p to a cu 4s orbital on one cuo@xmath54 plane , then hops to another cu 4s on an adjacent cuo@xmath54 plane via some intermediate orbitals between these two planes , and finally hops to an o 2p orbital on the second plane .",
    "schematically , this interlayer hopping process can be represented as @xmath69 where the subscripts ` 1 ' and 2 denote the first and second cuo layer , respectively .",
    "@xmath70 represents all relevant orbitals between two cuo layers .",
    "a doped hole has a certain probability to occupy the cu 3@xmath12 orbitals .",
    "however , as cu 3@xmath12 and @xmath64 orbitals are orthogonal to each other , a cu @xmath28 hole can not hop directly to a cu @xmath64 orbital .",
    "the hopping integral from @xmath71 to @xmath72 is proportional to the product of each individual virtual hopping process , hence the interlayer hopping integral , @xmath73 the wavefunction overlap between cu @xmath64 and @xmath74 is generally expected to be weakly dependent on @xmath75 .",
    "however , the wavefunction overlap between the bonding o @xmath66 and cu @xmath64 state has @xmath12 symmetry ( fig 1 ) , i.e. @xmath76 is proportional to @xmath77 , in each tetragonal cuo@xmath54 plane .",
    "thus @xmath78 , which vanishes along two diagonal directions of the in - plane brillouin zone .",
    "this is a unique property of high-@xmath1 oxides .",
    "the relation @xmath79 implies that there is no splitting in the band energy of electrons along the @xmath80 direction for different @xmath81 cross sections .",
    "this property was actually first found in lda band structure calculations @xcite and is supported by all lda calculations of high-@xmath1 cuprates with tetragonal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the above discussion indicates that the factor @xmath82 in @xmath83 comes from the _ in - plane _ wave function overlap in two cuo@xmath54 planes .",
    "thus @xmath84 holds for all high-@xmath1 cuprates with tetragonal symmetry , independently of the number of cuo@xmath54 layers per unit cell and the way they are coupled together . in @xmath85 or other body centred tetragonal systems",
    ", cu atoms do not lie collinearly along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "this will make the @xmath86 dependence of @xmath87 in @xmath88 more complicated , but will not alter the property @xmath89 .",
    "there is a small orthorhombic distortion in @xmath90 , @xmath20 , and a few other high-@xmath1 compounds .",
    "however , as the orthorhombic distortion is along the diagonal direction of the square cu lattice on cuo planes in these materials , @xmath91 is still valid even though the @xmath92 and @xmath93 axes are not exactly perpendicular to each other .    in high-@xmath1 oxides , cu @xmath64",
    "are always mixed with cu @xmath94 orbitals .",
    "thus in the above discussion a cu @xmath64 state should be taken as a mixed state of cu @xmath64 and @xmath94 orbitals .",
    "this mixing , however , does not alter the above discussion because the cu 3d@xmath95 orbital , like cu 4s , has rotational symmetry about the @xmath21-axis as well as reflection symmetry in the cuo plane .",
    "the overlap between the bonding o @xmath66 and cu 3d@xmath95 orbitals is also proportional to @xmath96 .    knowing that @xmath97 , we can now analyse the temperature dependence of @xmath7 . since at low @xmath3 ,",
    "the physical properties of a @xmath98-wave superconductor are determined by the quasiparticle excitations near the nodes , we can assume @xmath99 to be a @xmath86-independent constant .",
    "the zero of @xmath100 is located along the same direction as the @xmath12 gap nodes .",
    "this means that the paramagnetic current is greatly suppressed along the @xmath21-axis at low @xmath3 .",
    "thus the @xmath21-axis superfluid density must behave very differently than in an ordinary anisotropic system where @xmath7 varies linearly with @xmath3 [ eq . ( [ sc_ani ] ) ] .",
    "indeed , as shown by xiang and wheatley @xcite and later confirmed experimentally by the cambridge group @xcite , @xmath7 varies approximately as @xmath6 at low @xmath3 @xmath101 , \\label{t_five}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the gap maximum at @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the normal density of states on cuo@xmath54 planes .",
    "this @xmath6 term is from the contribution of the paramagnetic term : one power of @xmath3 is from the linear density of states of the @xmath5-wave superconductor , @xmath105 ; the other @xmath106 is from the @xmath107 factor in @xmath108 which is approximately proportional to @xmath109 at low energy .",
    "this @xmath6 power law of @xmath7 is true only if the high-@xmath1 pairing has the @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "if the gap nodes are not located along the zone diagonal , such as in a @xmath110-wave superconductor , the low temperature behavior of @xmath7 will be completely different .",
    "therefore , from the measurement of @xmath7 we can determine unambiguously whether the high-@xmath1 pairing has the @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "there are several effects which may lead to a finite hopping integral along the @xmath21-axis in the vicinity of the gap nodes in clean systems and thus a stronger @xmath3 dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "direct interplane hoppings which are not assisted by cu 4@xmath111 orbitals , for example , can make the @xmath21-axis dispersion finite around the gap nodes and eliminate the zeros in @xmath112 altogether . in this case",
    ", we may model the @xmath21-axis electronic structure by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 denotes the interlayer hopping integral at the gap nodes contributed from all possible interlayer hopping channels not assisted by cu 4@xmath111 states .",
    "@xmath114 is expected to be small in high-@xmath1 compounds , but it generates a small linear term in @xmath7 , with a slope proportional to @xmath115 , which dominates the @xmath21-axis superfluid response when @xmath116 .",
    "ybco contains cuo chains .",
    "this is the main feature which distinguishes ybco from other high-@xmath1 compounds .",
    "recently hardy and co - workers at ubc measured the penetration depth of untwinned single crystals of @xmath118 and @xmath119 along the three principal axes @xcite .",
    "they found that the ratio of the superfluid density in @xmath59 and @xmath120 directions at zero temperature is @xmath121 for the one - chain compound @xmath122 @xcite and @xmath123 for the two - chain compound @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "anisotropies of similar magnitudes are observed in the normal state resistivity as well @xcite .",
    "this indicates that more than half of the @xmath59-axis superfluid density comes from the contribution of cuo chains .",
    "knight shift and nmr relaxation rate measurements @xcite in @xmath122 have also revealed that there is an appreciable gap on the chains below @xmath1 .",
    "thus to understand the properties of the c - axis electromagnetic response functions in ybco , we need consider not only the properties of electrons on the cuo@xmath54 planes , but also those on the cuo chains .",
    "an interesting feature revealed by the penetration depth measurement of the one - chain compound @xmath11 is that the temperature dependences of the superfluid densities in @xmath120 and @xmath59 directions are similar : both are linear at low temperature @xcite , and roughly obey @xmath124 up to @xmath1 .",
    "the linear @xmath3 dependence of @xmath125 can be understood from the standard theory of @xmath5-wave superconductors .",
    "however , the relation @xmath124 is unexpected .",
    "this unexpected result indicates that the cuo chain layers must be intrinsically superconducting , yet there must be a node of the energy gap on the chain fermi surface sheet .",
    "otherwise , one should observe @xmath126 , instead of @xmath127 / { \\rm d}t |_{t=0 } \\simeq { \\rm d } [ \\rho_b^{(s)}(t ) / \\rho_b^{(s)}(0 ) ] / { \\rm d}t |_{t=0}$ ] , since the chain band gives no contribution to the linear temperature term of @xmath128 at low @xmath3 .",
    "as a 1d pairing state has a finite energy gap under ordinary circumstances , the presence of nodes suggests that the gap function of the chain band must have 2d character , i.e. inter - chain pairing exists even though direct inter - chain hopping does not exist in the chain layer .",
    "because of the 1d character of the cuo chains , the wavefunction overlap between o @xmath66 and cu @xmath64 orbitals on the cuo chain layers does not have the @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "this changes the @xmath86 dependence of @xmath129 and leads to a finite @xmath83 along @xmath130 .",
    "besides , the cuo@xmath54 planes in ybco are dimpled with relative displacements of o in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the o displacements further reduce the crystal symmetry and introduce a noticeable hybridization between the @xmath131 and @xmath132 bands .",
    "this hybridization will also make @xmath133 finite along the zone diagonals .",
    "thus in ybco , @xmath134 is not simply proportional to @xmath135 and @xmath7 will not follow that characteristic @xmath6 behavior at low @xmath3 .    in order to understand the low temperature behavior of @xmath136 ,",
    "let us consider a weak coupling bcs model of alternately stacking planar  cuo@xmath54 \" and chain  cuo \" layers along the c - axis @xcite : @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are electron operators in the plane and chain bands , respectively . to mimic the electronic structures of ybco - type materials",
    ", we assume the energy dispersions of the uncoupled plane and chain bands to be @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the chemical potentials of the plane and chain bands , respectively .",
    "the coupling between the chains and planes is introduced by the nearest neighbor interlayer hopping of electrons @xmath143 which vanishes at the zone boundary @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath49 is the interlayer hopping constant and is in general a function of @xmath86 .",
    "however , since @xmath49 is finite in the vicinity of @xmath12 gap nodes , we can take @xmath49 as a @xmath86-independent constant , when we discuss low temperature properties of @xmath145 .",
    "for ybco , @xmath146 is of the same order as @xmath147 , but @xmath49 is much smaller than @xmath147 or @xmath146 .",
    "the interlayer hopping hybridizes the plane and chain bands , and the energy dispersions of the hybridized plane and chain bands are given by @xmath148 when @xmath149 , the chain band acquires dispersion in the @xmath120 direction .",
    "the fermi surface of these hybridized bands is determined by the solution of @xmath150 . in fig .",
    "[ fermi_surface ] , we show the fermi surface contours of @xmath151 and @xmath152 on the @xmath153 ( solid curves ) and @xmath154 ( dashed curves ) planes . the area between the solid and dashed contours gives the @xmath155 dispersions of @xmath151 and @xmath156 .",

    "[ fermi_surface ] are chosen so that the fermi surface contours of @xmath157 and @xmath158 resemble qualitatively those of ybco as obtained by arpes measurements .    in @xmath159 ,",
    "@xmath160 and @xmath161 are the gap order parameters on the plane and chain layers , respectively .",
    "if pairing potentials exist independently ( or nearly independently ) on the planar and chain layers , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are then determined by self - consistent gap equations @xmath162 where @xmath163 ( @xmath164 , 2 ) are pairing potentials .",
    "when the plane and chain bands are uncoupled , there are two critical transition @xmath3 , corresponding to the superconducting transitions of cuo@xmath54 planes and cuo chains , respectively .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of electrons in the chain band is very strong since cuo chains are quasi - one dimensional , and the transition temperature of cuo chains , @xmath165 , is in general very small compared with the transition temperature of cuo@xmath54 planes , @xmath166 .",
    "in this case , @xmath167 will rise abruptly below @xmath165 where the contribution from the cuo chains to @xmath167 becomes finite , as shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "switching on the interlayer coupling leads to single superconducting phase transition with @xmath168 and a smooth curve of @xmath169 in the whole temperature range .",

    "this @xmath177 behavior of @xmath175 has actually been found recently in double - chain @xmath178 compound @xcite .",
    "however , in @xmath11 , this @xmath177 behavior or more generally the upturn curvature of @xmath179 , has not been observed in the penetration depth measurements by our group @xcite , neither the ubc group @xcite .",
    "the absence of a positive curvature in @xmath180 of @xmath117 implies that @xmath181 in @xmath117 should have the same order and follow approximately the same @xmath3 dependence as @xmath182 .",
