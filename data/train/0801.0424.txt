    "photometric studies of radio galaxies have shown that fanaroff - riley type i ( fr i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( low luminosity and edge - dimmed radio lobes ) and fr ii ( high luminosity and edge - brightened lobes ) radio galaxies exist in different environments in the local universe ; fr i galaxies reside in rich clusters while fr ii galaxies tend to inhabit poor clusters or rich groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "studies of higher redshift radio galaxies indicate that this difference disappears at moderate redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , where both fr types are associated with cluster - like environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , @xcite suggests that , although the environments of both types of galaxies are more dense at moderate redshifts than low redshifts , the environments of fr ii galaxies remain less dense than fr i sources out to @xmath4 . only the low redshift trend of fr i environments being more dense than the environments of fr ii galaxies",

    "it is quite difficult to detect and characterize group - like over - densities at moderate redshifts without spectroscopy .",

    "* ) that form a red sequence , and foreground and background interlopers are common",
    ". therefore , field spectroscopy is necessary to determine whether fr ii galaxies may be useful signposts to identify moderate redshift galaxy groups .",
    "these galaxy groups and poor clusters are excellent laboratories for studying galaxy evolution . over half of all galaxies in the local universe are members of groups @xcite , and these groups have moderate densities and low velocity dispersions that make them the preferred environments for dynamic galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "though cluster cores also promote some galaxy processing and evolution , the high velocity dispersions associated with these cores decrease the effective interaction cross - section between galaxies and limit the evolutionary effects of galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite use deep x - ray observations to select groups at moderate redshifts , though this method may preferentially select the most massive groups .",
    "gravitational lenses have also been used to identify moderate redshift groups @xcite , though the scarcity of lenses limits the utility of this method .",
    "radio galaxies have been used extensively to find high redshift clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in this paper we present spectroscopic observations of the fields of a sample of 14 moderate redshift radio galaxies .",

    "the sources in the first catalog were matched against the galaxies in the sdss dr 5 spectroscopic catalog @xcite with a conservative matching tolerance of 1 ; 99.9% of these matches are real , as determined by comparing the number of matches from the two catalogs to the number of matches between the sdss and a pseudo - random radio catalog ( the first catalog with a 2  offset applied to all sources ) .",
    "the resulting matched catalog was then searched for all objects that had at least two additional first sources within 60  of the host galaxy .",
    "these sources were all reviewed by eye to morphologically identify ` classical ' fr i and fr ii sources .",
    "note that our radio galaxy catalog differs slightly from the usual definition of fr i and fr ii sources , as all of our radio galaxies also have radio cores .",
    "the radio luminosities of these galaxies were determined by summing the fluxes of all detected first components that are part of the radio galaxy .",
    "we also summed the fluxes of nvss @xcite sources , and we choose the larger of the first / nvss values to assign the radio luminosity to the galaxy ; this allows us to account for the sensitivity differences of the surveys and for the possibility of flux being resolved out of the first images .",
    "the radio galaxies were then divided into lower luminosity ( @xmath1 ) and higher luminosity ( @xmath2 ) subsamples .",
    "the high luminosity criterion is motivated by previous studies of powerful radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the low luminosity criterion was chosen to provide a reasonable number of sources ( given the depth of the first survey at @xmath12 ) and to be well - separated from the high luminosity sample .",

    "there is a substantial amount of scatter in the properties of the radio galaxy environments , though the typical radio galaxy is in a group with approximately 12 members and a velocity dispersion of @xmath46 .",
    "the systems 222821.192@xmath13011412.29 and 013352.730@xmath13011343.63 are found to have only 3 companions in addition to the radio galaxy .",
    "these systems may not belong to bound groups but rather may be embedded in filaments ; the large velocity spread for the low - luminosity system 222821.192@xmath13011412.29 further supports this conclusion .",
    "we therefore conclude that at moderate redshifts , radio galaxies reside in all types of environments , from filaments to clusters , without regard to the radio luminosity .",
    "@xcite reach a similar conclusion from a study of the x - ray environments of higher redshift radio galaxies and quasars . thus , while radio galaxies are shown to trace large - scale - structure , they are not useful for targeting environments with specific properties ( e.g. , lower velocity dispersion or less rich environments ) at higher redshifts .",
