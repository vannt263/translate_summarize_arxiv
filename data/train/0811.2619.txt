    "the application of general relativity ( gr ) to the large length scales relevant in cosmology , necessarily requires an averaging operation to be performed on the einstein equations ( ellis @xcite ) .",
    "the nonlinearity of gr then implies that such an averaging will modify the einstein equations on these large scales .",
    "symbolically , this happens since @xmath0\\neq\\langle e[g]\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath1 is the metric and @xmath2 the einstein tensor .    in recent times",
    ", attention has been focused on two promising candidates for a consistent _ nonperturbative _ averaging procedure , namely the spatial averaging of scalars ( buchert @xcite ) and the covariant approach known as macroscopic gravity ( mg)(zalaletdinov @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude of the corrections has been debated in the literature ( see e.g. kolb  @xcite ; ishibashi & wald @xcite ; rasanen @xcite ; hirata & seljak @xcite )",
    ". broadly speaking , due to the structure of the riemann tensor , the modification terms @xmath3 in any averaging approach , will have a symbolic structure given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the christoffel connection , and the tilde represents any processing of the christoffels required by the averaging operation .    in this talk",
    "we will work within the mg framework of zalaletdinov , since this framework allows us to consistently define an averaged metric , which we will assume to be of the flat flrw form @xmath6 specifically , we will work in the spatial averaging limit of mg , which is relevant to cosmology ( paranjape & singh @xcite ) .",
    "we will also assume , consistently with observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , that the early universe was well described by a metric which is a perturbation around the flrw form , given by @xmath7 the main argument of this talk is that although technically possible , in the real world it is extremely unlikely that backreaction significantly influences the average cosmological expansion .",
    "in section 2 we will detail the calculation of the backreaction during the linear regime of perturbation theory , and mention some lessons that one can learn from this calculation . in section 3 we will describe a toy model of fully relativistic and nonlinear structure formation , and demonstrate that the metric for this model can be explicitly brought to the perturbed flrw form ( [ eq3 ] ) , _ even _ during the nonlinear phase of the evolution .",
    "a calculation of the backreaction along similar lines as in the linear case then shows that the backreaction in this toy model remains small even at late times , thus supporting our argument .",
    "the expression in ( [ eq1 ] ) can be used to obtain a simple estimate for the backreaction , assuming a perturbed flrw metric of the form ( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath8 in the absence of anisotropic stresses .",
    "we then have @xmath9 . assuming a two component flat background consisting of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and radiation ( known as standard cdm or scdm ) , and taking the averaging to be an ensemble average over the initial conditions",
    ", it is not difficult to show that in the matter dominated era , this estimate leads to @xmath10 $ ] arises from a product of the normalisation of the initial power spectrum @xmath11 , and the factor @xmath12 which arises in the transfer function integral , where @xmath13 is the wavenumber corresponding to the radiation - matter equality scale . ] .",
    "this indicates that at least for epochs around the last scattering epoch , the backreaction due to averaging was negligible .",
    "the real situation is somewhat more complex than this simple calculation indicates . on the one hand ,",
    "the time evolution of @xmath14 is needed in order to solve the equations satisfied by the perturbations , as we effectively did above by assuming a form for @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of the _ perturbations _ is needed to compute the correction terms @xmath3 .",
    "until these corrections are known , the evolution of the scale factor can not be determined ; and until we know this evolution , we can not solve for the perturbations .    to break this circle , we will adopt an iterative procedure .",
    "we first compute a `` zeroth iteration '' estimate for the backreaction , by assuming a fixed standard background @xmath15 such as scdm , evolve the perturbations and compute the time dependence of the objects @xmath3 , denoted @xmath16 .",
    "now , using these _ known _ functions of time , we form a new estimate for the background @xmath17 using the modified equations , and hence calculate the `` first iteration '' estimate @xmath18 . this process can then be repeated , and is expected to converge as long as perturbation theory in the metric remains a valid approximation .    with these ideas in mind , we can go ahead and compute the `` zeroth iteration '' estimate for the backreaction in the zalaletdinov framework .",
    "this is given by the following equations ( paranjape @xcite ) @xmath19   \\ , , \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] @xmath20 \\ , , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are negative definite and their magnitudes have been plotted .",
    "the vertical line marks the epoch of matter radiation equality @xmath28.,width=264 ]    here , the prime denotes a derivative wrt .",
    "conformal time ( @xmath29 ) , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the fourier space transfer function defined by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the initial power spectrum of @xmath34 .",
    "the results of a numerical calculation are shown in figure [ fig1 ] , where all functions are normalised by the hubble parameter @xmath35 , and confirm that this zeroth iteration estimate in fact gives a negligible contribution .",
    "further , were we to carry out the next iteration , we would essentially obtain no difference between the zeroth and first iteration scale factors upto the accuracy of the calculation , and hence this iteration has effectively converged at the first step itself .",
    "we see that the dominant contribution to the backreaction at late times , is due to a curvature - like term @xmath36 , as expected from our simple estimate above . in order to obtain a correction which grows faster than this , we need a nonstandard evolution of the metric potential @xmath34 , which can only happen if the _ scale factor _ evolves very differently from the scdm model , which in turn would require a significant contribution from the backreaction .",
    "the same circle of dependencies as before , now implies that _ as long as the metric is perturbed flrw _ , the backreaction appears to be dynamically suppressed .",
    "secondly , as figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show , scales which are approaching nonlinearity , _ do not _ contribute significantly to the backreaction , which is a consequence of the suppression of small scale power by the transfer function .",
    "we will return to this point when discussing the backreaction during epochs of nonlinear structure formation .",
    ", namely the function @xmath37 , at three sample values of the scale factor .",
    "the function dies down rapidly for large @xmath38 , with the value at some @xmath38 being progressively smaller with increasing scale factor .",
    "the declining behaviour of the curves for @xmath28 and @xmath39 extrapolates to large @xmath38.,width=264 ]     this shows that nonlinear scales do not impact the backreaction integrals significantly .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "let us now ask whether one can make meaningful statements concerning the backreaction during epochs of nonlinear structure formation , when matter density contrasts become very large and perturbation theory in the matter variables has broken down .",
    "we begin by considering some order of magnitude estimates .",
    "let us start with the assumption that although the matter perturbations are large , one can still expand the _",
    "metric _ as a perturbation around flrw .",
    "we are looking for either self - consistent solutions using this assumption , or any indication that this assumption is not valid .",
    "given that the metric has the form ( [ eq3 ] ) ( and further assuming @xmath8 as before ) , the relevant gravitational equation at late times and at length scales small comparable to @xmath40 , is the poisson equation given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the density contrast of cdm .",
    "as before , we can estimate the dominant backreaction component to be @xmath43 .",
    "now , for an over / under - density of physical size @xmath44 , treating @xmath45 and @xmath46 on dimensional grounds , we have @xmath47 for voids , we can set @xmath48 , and then @xmath49 , since we have assumed @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that sub - hubble underdense voids are expected to give a negligible backreaction . for overdense regions we need to be more careful ,",
    "since here @xmath51 can grow very large . in a typical spherical collapse scenario ,",
    "the following relations hold , @xmath52 @xmath53 which lead to @xmath54\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq14}\\ ] ] it would therefore appear that at late enough times , the perturbative expansion in the metric breaks down with @xmath55 , and the backreaction grows large @xmath56 .",
    "however , the crucial question one needs to answer is the following : is this situation actually realised in the universe , or are we simply taking these models too far ?",
    "we make the claim that perturbation theory in the metric _ does not _",
    "break down at late times , since _ observed peculiar velocities remain small_. the spherical collapse model is not a good approximation when _ model _ peculiar velocities in the collapsing phase grow large . to support this claim , we will work with an exact toy model of spherical collapse .",
    "the model we consider was presented by paranjape & singh ( @xcite ) , and can be summarized as follows .",
    "the matter content of the model is spherically symmetric pressureless `` dust '' , and hence the relevant exact solution is the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) metric given by @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the proper time measured by observers with fixed coordinate @xmath60 , which is comoving with the dust .",
    "@xmath61 is the physical area radius of the dust shell labelled by @xmath60 , and satisfies the equation @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the mass contained inside each comoving shell , and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath59 . the energy density of dust measured by an observer comoving with it satisfies the equation @xmath64 , where the prime now denotes a derivative with respect to the ltb radius @xmath60 .",
    "initial conditions are set at a scale factor value of @xmath65 , and are chosen such that the initial situation describes an flrw expansion with a perturbative central overdensity out to radius @xmath66 , surrounded by a perturbative underdensity out to radius @xmath67 , with appropriately chosen values for the various parameters in the model ( see table 1 of paranjape & singh @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the evolution of the overdensity contrast in the central region . clearly , at late times the situation is completely nonlinear",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that a coordinate transformation in this model can bring its metric to the form ( [ eq3 ] ) , _ provided _ one has @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "physically @xmath70 is the `` comoving '' peculiar velocity",
    ". the metric potentials ( which are actually equal at the leading order , see van acoleyen @xcite ) have the expressions @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are obtained by integrating @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "a numerical calculation shows that @xmath77 and hence the metric potentials do in fact remain small for the entire evolution , for _ this _ model .",
    "further , the infall peculiar velocity can only become large if the true infall velocity @xmath78 is large , in which case the specific background chosen to define the peculiar velocity , becomes irrelevant ( since @xmath50 ) .",
    "hence , the fact that relativistic infall velocities are _ not _ observed in real clusters etc . , leads us to expect very generally that the perturbed flrw form for the metric should in fact be recoverable even at late times .",
    "finally , figure [ fig5 ] shows the dominant contribution to the backreaction in the toy model ( paranjape & singh @xcite ) . there is a significant departure from a curvature - like behaviour , due to evolution of the metric potentials .",
    "more importantly , the maximum value of the backreaction here is @xmath80 , as opposed to @xmath81 as seen in the linear theory .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the inhomogeneity of our toy model is only on relatively small , nonlinear scales ( @xmath82mpc ) , and the value of the backreaction is therefore consistent with our earlier observation that nonlinear scales contribute negligibly to the total backreaction . to conclude",
    ", we have seen that as long as the metric has the perturbed flrw form , the backreaction remains small .",
    "further , there are strong reasons to expect that the metric remains a perturbation around flrw even at late times during nonlinear structure formation , a claim that is supported by our toy model calculation .",
    "it should be possible to test this claim in @xmath83-body simulations as well .",
    "it appears therefore , that backreaction can not explain the observed acceleration of the universe .",
