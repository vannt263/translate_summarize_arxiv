    "be / x  ray binary systems ( bexbs ) represent the majority of the known high mass x  ray binaries ( hmxbs ) hosting an accreting rotating magnetic neutron star ( white , nagase & parmar 1995 ) .",
    "phenomenologically , in the x  ray band , bexbs can be divided into at least three subclasses : ( i ) bright transients which display giant x  ray outbursts up to l@xmath2=10@xmath3@xmath4 ( type ii ; stella et al .",
    "1986 ) unrelated with the orbital phase , with high spin  up rates , ( ii ) transients which display periodic outbursts of relatively high luminosity ( l@xmath2@xmath510@xmath610@xmath7@xmath4 ; type i ) generally occurring close to the periastron passage of the neutron star , and ( iii ) sources displaying no outbursts , but comparatively moderate variations ( up to a factor of @xmath0 10100 ) and low  luminosity ( @xmath810@xmath6 @xmath4 ) pulsed persistent emission ( negueruela 1998 ) .",
    "4u0115 + 634 ( p=3.6s ) , v0332 + 30 ( p=4.4s ) and exo2030 + 375 ( p=41.7s ) are all examples of the first two classes . among the latter group , there are the well known x  ray pulsators xper ( p=835s ) and rxj0146.9 + 6121 ( p=1455s ) .",
    "moreover , differences between the galaxy and the magellanic cloud population of bexbs have been studied and are probably due to the different star formation rate ( see stevens et al .",
    "emission ( be ) spectral  type stars are characterized by high rotational velocities ( up to 70% of their break  up velocity ) , and by episodes of equatorial mass ejection which might produce a rotating ring of gas around the star at irregular time intervals . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "be stars are difficult to classify due to the presence of the circumstellar envelope responsible for the emission",

    "the hard x  ray transient gs083443  ( @xmath9@xmath0262.0 , @xmath10@xmath01.51 ) was discovered by the watch experiment onboard granat in 1990 at a flux level of about 1 crab in the 515 kev energy band ( sunyaev 1990 ) .",
    "the source was later observed by ginga ( makino 1990a , 1990b ) and rosat as a part of the all sky survey ( hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ) providing a much better positional accuracy ( radius of 50 ) .",
    "moreover pulsations at a period of 12.3 s were observed during the ginga , rosat and art ",
    "p observations ( makino 1990c ; aoki et al .  1992 ; hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ; grebenev & sunyaev 1990 ) . a target of opportunity rosat pointing performed in 1991 may allowed the source position to be determined with an uncertainty radius of 9   ( belloni et al .",
    "an optical follow  up observation of the stars within this error circle was performed at the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) in january 1991 : no plausible optical counterpart was found down to a limiting magnitude of r@xmath023.5 ( belloni et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "gs083443  was also monitored by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) between april 1991 and july 1998 .",
    "in particular seven outbursts were observed from april 1991 and june 1993 with a peak and intra  outburst flux of about 300mcrab and @xmath1110mcrab , respectively ( wilson et al .",
    "the recurrence time of 105115 days was interpreted as the orbital period of the system .",
    "however , no further outbursts have been observed since july 1993 either with cgro / batse and the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x  ray timing explorer .",
    "all these findings suggested that gs083443  is a new be  star / x  ray binary system in an eccentric orbit ( wilson et al .",
    "however the lack of any plausible optical counterpart remained a key point against this interpretation .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of the optical counterpart of gs083443 a @xmath12=20.4 be spectral  type star .",
    "starting from three public rosat pspc observations of gs083443  we obtained two new independent position measurements ( uncertainty radius of 10 ) . within these new error circles we found a highly reddened star ( v  r=2.24 ) , the optical spectrum of which shows a strong h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the optical counterpart was also observed in the ir showing that this star is by far the brightest object in the field ( @xmath13=11.4 ) .",
    "our findings together , obtained from observations in three different energy bands , support the be  star / x  ray binary nature of gs083443 .",
    "the pspc ( 0.12.4 kev ) detector on board rosat observed the field including gs083443   several times . in the rosat public archive",
    "there are 5 observations performed between april and december 1991 .",
    "pspc images were accumulated in the 0.52.0 kev range in order to reduce the strong and spatially inhomogeneous local background dominated by the soft x ",
    "ray emission from the vela supernova remnant .",
    "both a sliding cell and a wavelet transform  based detection algorithm were used in order to characterize the physical parameters ( position , count rate , s / n ratio , etc . ) of gs083443   when detected , and to obtain a 3@xmath14 count rate upper limit in case of non  detection ( lazzati et al .",

    "table1 summarizes the results of this analysis .",

    "the s / n ratio of the summed dfosc spectrum is acceptable only above @xmath06000 , while at @xmath157500  the signal is dominated by interference fringes .",
    "the steep rise of the spectrum in the uv argues for a very hot and reddened object .",
    "the absence of strong forbidden lines rules out the possibility of a pre  main sequence object or a cataclysmic variable .",
    "moreover the absence of strong absorption features points to an ob spectral  type star .",
    "the main features of the dfosc spectrum are : ( i ) a strong h@xmath1 emission ",
    "line with equivalent width ew@xmath030@xmath162 , and ( ii ) pronounced interstellar absorption lines for naii ( 5890  and 6270 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 line shows an extended and asymmetric profile . at 11  spectral resolution",
    ", this might indicate a line splitting , possibly due to the presence of a disk .",
    "all this evidence clearly points to the association of this object with the x  ray source .",
    "the emmi spectrum has a slightly better s / n ratio and allows us to extend the spectral region into the 55008400  range .",
    "however , a precise spectral classification is not yet possible . a few siii lines ( e.g. the strong 5466.435466.87  doublet )",
    "are recognizable , suggesting a b2 spectral type .",
    "however the uncertainty on the spectral classification is large , ranging from an o8e to a b3e star .",
    "emission features corresponding to hei lines ( e.g. 6678 and 7281 ) are also evident , while the hei lines at 7065 and 7818  look filled in , as well as faint nebular [ nii ] lines on both sides of h@xmath1 , which most likely are due to the superposed emission from the vela snr ( see fig.3 ) . in the emmi spectrum the h@xmath1 ew is 33@xmath162 , while the fwzh is 41@xmath163 , corresponding to a stellar wind terminal velocity v@xmath17@xmath51800 km s@xmath18 .",
    "deep interstellar lines and bands are clearly visible in the star spectra , the nad2 doublet having an ew of 4.1@xmath160.8 .",
    "star b the position of which is still marginally consistent with the new x - ray error circle was observed on 1999 january 19 .",
    "we obtained a low  resolution ( 11 ) spectrum ( 1h exposure time ; 20 slit ; 17 seeing ) with a grism covering the 35007000  spectral range .",
    "star b is even more difficult to study being fainter than star d. although the spectrum has a low s / n ratio , we detected large and deep absorption features typical of late type stars ( probably an early m ) .",
    "moreover no emission lines were visible in its spectrum .",
    "infrared observations were carried out on 1993 april 1 during service observing time using the infrared imager spectrograph ( iris ) instrument ( allen 1993 ) mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 3.9 m anglo  australian telescope ( aat ) , siding springs observatory , new south wales .",
    "images were obtained in the j ( 60s ) , h ( 20s ) and k@xmath19 ( 5 secs . ) bands .",
    "the data were reduced using the starlink figaro software ( shortridge et al .",
    "1998 ) , and analysed using the photom package ( eaton & draper 1998 ) .",
    "the standard stars hd 84090 and hd 100231 were used for calibration purposes , giving absolute uncertainties of around 0.02 magnitudes in each band ( although the h band image was near the saturation limit of the detector and should be treated with a little more suspicion ) .",
    "taking the colours of a b2v star from wegner ( 1994 ) as ( v  k)=0.67 , ( j  k)=0.18 and ( h  k)=0.04 , using the reddening relationships which gives e(j  k)/e(b  v)=+0.50 , and combining these with the observed values for gs083443 , we find e(j  k)=+2.0 and thus e(b  v)=+4.0 . taking the parameter r@xmath20=3.3 ( r@xmath20=a@xmath21/e(b  v ) ) , we estimate an extinction of a@xmath21=13.2 from the ir magnitudes .",
    "the x  ray , optical and ir observations of the field of gs083443 s presented here , led to the identification of the optical counterpart of this 12s transient x  ray pulsar discovered in 1990 .",
    "the measurement of the distance to gs083443  based on the optical data is hampered by the uncertainties in the spectral classification .",
    "however some information can be inferred based on our optical and ir photometric measurements .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath22 color for gs083443  is @xmath23 ( assuming a main sequence star with spectral type in the o9b3 range ) .",
    "since the observed @xmath22 is @xmath02.25 the reddening should amount to @xmath24 , and assuming a standard reddening law ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) this converts to @xmath25 ( regardless of whether the reddening medium is uniformly distributed along the line of sight or is intrinsic to the source ) .",
    "moreover from the x  ray spectral fits , we derive a @xmath26 of 12 @xmath27 10@xmath28 which is in good agreement with the photometric reddening estimate ( bohlin et al .",
    ". the observed magnitude of gs083443  is @xmath29 and the absolute @xmath30 magnitude of a star with the assumed spectral type is within @xmath31 .",
    "taking into account the effects of reddening , a distance modulus within @xmath32 can be derived .",
    "this translates to a distance of @xmath05 - 17kpc , well beyond the vela snr located at @xmath0500pc .",
    "however the galaxy edge in the direction of gs083443  is located at @xmath06kpc , so we can put a limit on the spectral  type of star d assuming that it is placed at the galactic border . for an o9 , b0 or b2 dwarf star",
    "we obtain a reddened ( @xmath25 ) @xmath30 magnitude at 6 kpc ( distance modulus of @xmath0 14 ) of 16.5 , 17 and 18.5 , respectively . when compared with the observed r magnitude of 18.2 for star d , this suggests a b2ve spectral  type star .",
    "also the derived e(b ",
    "v)=+4.0 from the ir data suggests a highly reddened object . using the relationship for the contribution of the circumstellar ( cs ) environment derived by fabregat and reglero ( 1990 ) , where e@xmath33=0.00490.00185 ew(h@xmath1 ) , and given the observed ew(h@xmath1)@xmath030 , we estimate e@xmath33 to be only 0.06 magnitudes .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the extinction is interstellar rather than local to gs083443 .",
    "this results confirm that the contribution of the disc ( which is clearly present , given the large equivalent width inferred for h@xmath1 ) to the observed ir colors is relatively small .",
    "however the value of a@xmath21@xmath013 derived from the ir observations differs significantly from that estimated from the optical data ( where a@xmath34@xmath07 , and thus a@xmath21@xmath09.4 ) , suggesting that the object is either earlier in spectral class than b2 , closer that 56kpc , or possibly not a main sequence object .",
    "the observed magnitudes are similar to those of exo 2030 + 375 ( see e.g. negueruela 1998 ) , which is compatible with a b0v star at @xmath03kpc or a b0iii at @xmath05kpc .    based on both photometric and spectroscopic findings",
    "we conclude that star d is most likely a b02 v ",
    "iiie star at a distance of 35kpc . a more accurate distance and spectral classification will have to await detailed optical spectroscopic observations in the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "for a distance of 5kpc and extrapolating the 0.12kev rosat fluxes to the 110 kev band ( we assume the spectral model fitted by aoki et al .",
    "1992 using ginga data ) we obtain an outburst peak luminosity l@xmath35(110kev)@xmath558@xmath2710@xmath6erg  s@xmath18 . a somewhat higher luminosity ( @xmath510@xmath7erg  s@xmath18 )",
    "would be inferred by extrapolating the 20100kev batse peak flux reported by wilson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to the 110kev band .",
    "such a peak luminosity is a typical value shown by x - ray pulsars which also display type i outbursts ( stella et al .",
    "1986 ; negueruela 1998 ) occurring close to the time of periastron passage and with a periodic recurrence given by the orbital period of the system .",
