    "<S> we report constraints on the parameters of yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravity from measurements of the gradient of the casimir force in the configuration of an au - coated sphere above a si plate covered with corrugations of trapezoidal shape . for this purpose , the exact expression for the gradient of yukawa force in the experimental configuration is derived and compared with that obtained using the proximity force approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the reported constraints are of almost the same strength as those found previously from several different experiments on the casimir force and extend over a wide interaction range from 30 to 1260 nm . </S>",
    "<S> it is discussed how to make them stronger by replacing the material of the plate . </S>"
