    "soon after the @xmath9-ray flash , optical and x - ray afterglows of gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are among the brightest sources in the sky at cosmological redshifts .",
    "more than thirty grb redshifts have been measured to date and their distribution ranges from 0.168 ( greiner et al .",
    "2003 ) to 4.5 ( andersen et al . 2000 ) with a median of z @xmath10 ( excluding grb 980425 if at z=0.0085 ) .",
    "follow - up observations of the grb localized by bepposax , the ipn and by the rxte and hete2 satellites , show that tens of minutes after the grb the optical afterglow can be as bright as r=14 - 16 mag ; a few hours later it can still be as bright as r=17 - 19 mag .",
    "an exceptionally bright example is the case of grb 030329 for which the optical afterglow reached r=12.7 mag at 1.5 hours from the grb and it decreased down to r=19 mag after @xmath11 days ( e.g. price et al . 2003 ; stanek et al .",
    ". the x - rays afterglow can be as bright as the crab nebula a few minutes after the grb , while 5 - 8 hours later it can be as bright as a bright agn , i.e. @xmath12mcrabs ( see frontera et al .",
    "2000 , also fiore et al .",
    "2000 for an estimate of the grb afterglows logn - logf in the range 0.5 - 2.0 kev , where fluxes are integrated from minutes up to hours after the grb event ) .",
    "this opens up the perspective for gathering spectra of high quality of sources at cosmological redshifts , provided that the afterglow can be observed in such short time scales .",
    "spectral studies of grb afterglows can provide crucial data on the environments in which grb occurs .",
    "this can give us both important constraints on the nature of the grb progenitor and on the interstellar matter ( ism ) in the grb host galaxies .",
    "candidate grb progenitor include : collapsars ( woosley 1993 , paczynski 1998 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , supranovae ( vietri & stella 1998 ) , mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole ( e.g. eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; paczynski 1990 ; narayan , paczynski & piran 1992 ; meszaros & rees 1992 ) .",
    "multiwavelength afterglow observations suggest the association of `` long grb '' ( for which the duration of the prompt event peaks at @xmath13s , e.g. norris , scargle & bonnell 2000 ) progenitor with massive stars .",
    "some indications are , among others : i ) the grb locations relative to their host galaxy ( bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2002a ) ; ii ) the detection of iron lines in the x - ray afterglow spectrum of five grb ( piro et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; yoshida et al .",
    "1999 ; antonelli et al .",
    "2000 ; amati et al .",
    "2000 ) ; iii ) the presence of late re - brightening in the light curves of some afterglows , interpreted as the evidence of an underlying supernova ( e.g. bloom et al .",
    "2002b ) ; iv ) the presence of supernova features emerging in the optical afterglow spectra of grb 030329 ( stanek et al .",
    "2003 , hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ; kawabata et al .",
    "2003 ) and of grb 021211 ( della valle et al . 2003 ) . because of the short lifetimes of massive stars , it is likely that their collapse happens close to their star forming region , that is , close to a dense and dusty environment ( e.g. fryer , woosley & hartman 1999 ; perna & belczynski 2002a )",
    "therefore , one important element in favor of massive star progenitor would be the evidence of strong dust extinction .",
    "indeed , the non detection of the @xmath14 of x - ray afterglows at optical wavelengths ( dark grb ) , favors this hypothesis .",
    "however , the optical spectra of grb afterglows , do not generally show strong reddening ( simon et al .",
    "2001 ; galama & wijers 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , lazzati , covino & ghisellini ( 2002 ) show that even if dark grb are located in the innermost regions of galactic - like molecular clouds , in several cases the corresponding visual extinction is not enough to hide their optical afterglows .",
    "therefore , a more accurate study of the grb environment is needed .",
    "prompt observations of grb afterglows offer a new and distinctive path for the study of the matter in the immediate surroundings of the grb , r@xmath61 - 10  pc ( perna & loeb 1998 ; bttcher et al .",
    "1999 ; perna et al . 2002b ; perna & lazzati 2002c ; fox et al .",
    "2003 ) and in the grb host galaxy ( ciardi & loeb 2000 ; fiore 2001 ; bloom et al . 2002a",
    "; savaglio , fall & fiore 2003 ) x - ray and optical - uv spectroscopy can tell us about gas density and ionization status , metal abundances , dust content and kinematics of the matter in the grb environment .",
    "this can be done by using both emission features and absorption features ( see e.g. kumar & narayan 2003 ; bttcher et al .",
    "1999 ; piro et al .",
    "2000 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "although absorption features are more difficult to study than emission lines , they carry with them unbeatable information , because they probe matter along a single beam , i.e. along the line of sight to the background beacon .",
    "this greatly reduces the complications related to the matter geometry and dynamics , which strongly affects emission line studies .",
    "even when such emission or absorption features are not detected or are not resolved , x - ray spectra can provide useful information from measures of low energy cut - offs due to photoelectric absorption    moreover , grb afterglows can be used to study the ism of their host galaxies .",
    "high redshifts galaxies have so far been studied mainly via ` lyman - break galaxies ' ( e.g. steidel et al . 1999 ) , and via galaxies which happen to lie along the line of sight to bright quasars , notably the ` damped lyman - alpha ' systems ( dla , e.g. pettini et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "however , probably neither of these methods gives an undistorted view of the bulk of the typical high redshifts galaxy .",
    "lyman - break galaxies are characterized by pronounced star - formation and their inferred chemical abundances may be related to these regions rather than being representative of typical high z galaxies ( see e.g. steidel et al .",
    "dla studies are likely to be biased against dusty systems , since these would hide the background quasars in color - based surveys .",
    "furthermore , dla are often identified with dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies and therefore may not be representative of the full high z galaxy population .",
    "on the other hand , grb seem to occur well within the main body of their host galaxies , not in the outer halos ( bloom et al .",
    "2002a ) , therefore , grb afterglows can provide a powerful , independent tool to study the ism of high redshifts galaxies ( castro et al .",
    "2003 , mirabal et al .",
    "2002 , fiore 2001 ; savaglio et al .",
    "the latter authors compared metal column density in grb host galaxies with those of dlas .",
    "they find that while the column densities of iron and magnesium are similar or slightly higher than that in dlas , the column of zinc are significantly higher .",
    "since iron and magnesium , unlike zinc , tend to be depleted in dust , this finding indicates that a significant fraction of these elements is in dust since not observed through absorption lines , thus grb are probably probing denser and dustier regions , than dlas .",
    "we present in this paper the results of a systematic spectral analysis of 13 grb afterglows observed by bepposax in x - rays , and by several ground based telescopes in optical - uv , aimed at measuring and constraining the x - ray absorption along the line of sight as well as the extinction in the optical - uv bands .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained in the two spectral band will provide constraints on the dust to gas ratio of the absorbing matter and on the dust properties , as seen from several hours to a few days from the grb event .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 shows the bepposax x - ray afterglow selected sample ;  3 presents the x - ray data reduction and spectra extraction procedures , along with a discussion on the systematics affecting the column density measurements ;  4 presents the optical photometry of 9 grb afterglows of our sample with a detected optical counterpart ; results are presented and discussed in  5 and  6 respectively .",
    "we selected from the bepposax archive all the x - ray afterglows observed during a period of four years ( from february 1997 to february 2001 ) that have enough counts in the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) to extract a spectrum and to perform a spectral analysis , that is , with a signal to noise ratio @xmath15 in the 2.0 - 10.0 kev .",
    "we also required that the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) 0.1 - 2 kev spectra contain at least 20 counts , or that the counts expected in this lecs band , based on simulations performed using the best fit power law model obtained from the mecs spectrum and assuming a column density equal to the galactic value along the line of sight , are also smaller than the above threshold at the @xmath16 confidence level , not to miss bright and highly obscured afterglows .",
    "the number of afterglow observations satisfying these requirements is 13 .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] summarize the selected grb x - ray afterglows along with the galactic hydrogen column density along the line of sight to each grb , as determined from the coarse , @xmath17 deg resolution , maps of dickey & lockmann ( 1990 ) , the host galaxy redshifts if known , the r.a . and",
    "coordinates and the optical detection .",
    "redshifts measurements are from optical spectroscopy except for grb 000214 ( antonelli et al .",
    "2000 ) , for which a redshifts of @xmath18 was inferred assuming that the observed emission line is the iron @xmath19 line at 6.7 kev ( rest frame ) .",
    "the grb afterglows observations were performed with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfi ) , lecs 0.1 - 10 kev ( parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) , mecs 1.3 - 10 kev ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) , hpgspc 4 - 60 kev ( manzo et al . 1997 ) and pds 13 - 200 kev ( frontera et al .",
    "lecs ( 1 unit ) and mecs ( 3 units ) are imaging gas scintillation proportional counters , the hpgspc is a collimated high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter and the pds consists of four collimated phoswich units .",
    "we report here the analysis of only the lecs and mecs data because grb afterglows are usually many times fainter than the pds and hpgspc internal backgrounds .",
    "after 1997 may 6@xmath20 mecs observations were performed with mecs2 and mecs3 units only because on this date a technical failure caused the switch off of the mecs1 unit .",
    "for all the selected grb sample , data from the mecs2 and mecs3 units were combined together , after gain equalization , to increase the signal to noise ratio . in the case of grb 970228",
    "( that is the only grb in our sample observed before 1997 may ) we used the data from mecs3 only , since the source happened to lie just below the beryllium strongback support of the mecs1 and mecs2 windows ( which basically absorbs all photons below about 5 kev ) .",
    "standard data reduction was performed using the saxdas software package version 2.0 following fiore , guainazzi & grandi ( 1999 ) .",
    "lecs and mecs spectra were extracted from regions of radii between 3 and 8 arcmin , chosen to maximize the count rate in the 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 10 kev band respectively .",
    "the choice of the extraction radius depends on the source and background intensity , and on the instrument point spread function , psf .",
    "the 90% encircled energy generally is within 3 - 4 arcmin for the mecs and within 6 - 8 arcmin for the lecs ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted in detector coordinates from high galactic latitude ( @xmath21 deg ) `` blank fields '' ( averaged lecs and mecs pointing of sky regions without strong x - ray sources , for a total exposure of about half a million of seconds in both instruments , fiore et al .",
    "1999 ) using the same source extraction regions .",
    "`` local '' background can not be safely used when analyzing lecs and mecs spectra , because of the relatively broad psf and because the background strongly varies with the position in the detector ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 and chiappetti et al .",
    "we have compared the mean level of the background in the lecs and mecs `` blank fields '' observations to the mean level of the background in the grb observations using source free regions at various positions in the detectors .",
    "the `` local '' mecs background count rate is within 2% than that in the `` blank fields '' . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` local '' lecs background count rate differs from that of the `` blank fields '' by up to 20% in 7 cases . in these cases",
    "the `` blank fields '' background spectrum was multiplied by appropriate correction factors before subtraction from the source spectrum .",
    "usually , the position of grb afterglows is not know with accuracies better than several arcminutes at the moment of the bepposax nfi pointing . on these scales",
    "the vignetting of the telescopes varies significantly ( see e.g. fiore et al .",
    "furthermore , the lecs thin polypropylene window is supported by a mesh of grids of tungsten wires that introduces a complicated pattern of obscuration .",
    "the actual value of obscuration strongly depends on the exact position of the source centroid in detector coordinates .",
    "the spacing of the thicker wire grid is of about 2 arcmin , much less than the uncertainty on the afterglow position .",
    "this means that the afterglow position in detector coordinates with respect to the thick wire grid can not be known ` a priori ' as well as the level of the grid obscuration .",
    "for these two reasons we therefore not used the standard on axis effective area files , but we evaluated the instrument effective area at the afterglow position in detector coordinates ( we used the sax / lecs data analysis software lemat ) .",
    "these ` ad hoc ' effective area file takes correctly into account the energy dependent telescope vignetting and the photons absorbed by the lecs support mesh wires . on axis redistribution matrices , from the december 1999 release",
    "have been used for both lecs and mecs , since these depend very little on the source position in the detectors .",
    "table [ tbl-2 ] gives the lecs and mecs exposure times , optimum extraction radius , background and source count rates .",
    "note that lecs exposure times are usually smaller than mecs ones since it is operated during dark time only .",
    "table [ tbl-3 ] gives the mecs off - axis angles , the time interval between the grb trigger and the nfi pointing , the lecs ` raw ' detector pixel coordinates of the source , at which the effective area has been computed .    to get gaussian statistics and",
    "so to ensure the applicability of the @xmath8 test to evaluate the goodness of our fits , lecs and mecs spectra were rebinned to obtain at least 20 counts per energy channel .",
    "we then performed simultaneous lecs and mecs spectral fitting using the bands 0.1(or 0.4 kev , see below ) 4.0 kev and 1.6 - 10.0 kev in the two instruments respectively ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "errors quoted in this paper for the column density and the spectral index are 90% confidence intervals for two parameters of interest ( @xmath22 ) , unless differently specified .",
    "the knowledge of the galactic column density along the line of sight to each burst is crucial for our study .",
    "relatively small errors in the evaluation of the galactic columns would translate in a larger errors on the rest frame absorption , since best fit @xmath2 values scale with redshift as @xmath23 ( the photoelectric cross section scaling with energy roughly as @xmath24 ) .",
    "the values in table [ tbl-1 ] have been obtained interpolating on a grid with spacing of 3 degrees ( dickey & lockmann 1990 ) .",
    "it is well known that the galactic column density can vary on much smaller scales ( elvis , lockman & wilkes 1989 ) .",
    "to evaluate the average magnitude of this variation we compared the galactic column density obtained using the coarse 3 degrees 21 cm emission maps along the line of sights of a sample of agn for which an accurate 21 cm emission measurements were already performed by using a 21 arcmin beam nrao 140 ft telescope at green bank by elvis et al .",
    "we found that the average ratio between the two determinations is close to 1 and that the standard deviation is of 0.16 , independent of the value of the galactic column density .",
    "the highest positive deviation found is of 50% .",
    "we therefore performed for each grb three series of fits , one with the nominal galactic @xmath2 value and the other two by increasing this value by 16% and 50% respectively , to check whether additional extra galactic absorption would still be significantly even in case the galactic column has been underestimated in the dickey & lockmann ( 1990 ) maps .",
    "another tracer of the column density of matter in a given direction is the infrared emission at @xmath25 .",
    "this can therefore be used as a further check of the galactic column density values given in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we used the iras faint source survey to search for any `` cirrus '' contamination along the line of sight of each grb .",
    "we used a 10 to 30 arcmin radius search region to measure the @xmath25 mjy / sr brightness @xmath26 . by adopting @xmath27 mjy / sr 10@xmath28 @xmath4 as typical galactic dust to gas ratio ( reach , heiles & koo 1993 ; heiles ,",
    "reach & kooh 1988 ; de vries , heithausen & thaddeus 1987 ) we estimated the implied @xmath29 values and then compared them with the maps of dickey & lockmann ( 1990 ) .",
    "all the inferred @xmath29 values reveal no absorption excess due to presence of cirrus along the analyzed line of sight .",
    "the background subtraction procedure previously described works well if the galactic column density along the line of sight to the grb , is not much higher ( or lower ) than that in the `` blank fields '' .",
    "otherwise the background low energy spectrum ( e.g. below 0.3 kev ) would be very different from that of the `` blank fields '' .",
    "blank fields are all at high galactic latitude , and the average galactic column density along their line of sight is @xmath30 @xmath4 .",
    "several afterglows in our sample have a galactic column density much higher than this value ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) . adopting the `` blank field '' background spectrum for those afterglows at galactic @xmath31@xmath4 it would results in an over - subtraction of the background below 0.3 - 0.4 kev and in a consequent overestimate of the intrinsic absorbing column . as an example",
    ", the 0.2 kev flux would decrease by @xmath32 by increasing @xmath2 from @xmath33@xmath4 to @xmath34@xmath4 . at 0.4 - 0.5",
    "kev the flux would decrease by much smaller amount , of the order of 10 - 20% .",
    "we therefore decided to limit the spectral analysis of the afterglows with galactic column densities higher than @xmath34 @xmath4 to energies higher than 0.4 kev .",
    "a constant normalization factor must be introduced in the fitting models in order to take into account the systematic error in the knowledge of the absolute lecs and mecs normalization factor ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 ) . assuming the mecs as reference instrument , the expected factor between lecs and mecs for constant sources is about @xmath35 .",
    "however , grb afterglows are not constant sources : their flux decreases usually as a power law with index @xmath36 in the range @xmath37 ( see e.g. costa et al . 1999 ; piro 2002a ) .",
    "moreover , the non completely simultaneous observations of the lecs and mecs instruments due to the switch - off of the lecs during part of the orbit , introduces a further complication in the determination of the normalization factor .",
    "we have therefore decided to leave completely free the normalization factor in the fits .",
    "we are aware that letting the normalization factor be free to vary introduces an additional degree of freedom in the fit and consequently increases the uncertainty on the derived @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , a truly curved spectral shape toward the lower energies could be mimicked , in spectra of low statistics , by a lower mecs to lecs normalization factor . as an example a factor of @xmath38 lower normalization factor , could mimic a factor of @xmath39 lower @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath40 lecs - mecs normalization factor confidence intervals are reported in tables [ tbl-5 ] and [ tbl-6 ] .",
    "for 9 of the 13 selected grb with x - ray afterglow an optical afterglow was also discovered ( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "we collected the optical and near infrared magnitudes of these nine grb from the literature to study the extinction properties through the comparison of dust extinction models to the afterglow spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we selected , among the large number of papers reporting photometric data on a given grb optical afterglow , those works containing the widest possible frequency coverage and the best and most complete documentation .",
    "we list and discuss the references used for each grb afterglow in the appendix section .",
    "observations in different bands are usually performed at different times . since optical afterglows",
    "are sources with fluxes rapidly decaying in time , their magnitudes have been extrapolated to a single specific time @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath41 was selected to be as close as possible to the first optical observations , to keep the statistical uncertainties on the observed magnitudes small .",
    "the extrapolation of the observations at different bands at @xmath41 was performed by adopting the best fit decay index quoted in the literature .",
    "corrections for the galactic interstellar extinction have been performed , unless explicitly specified , using the iras 100 @xmath42 e(b - v ) maps by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , sfd ) and we derived the extinction at different wavelengths using the extinction curve parameterization by cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) assuming @xmath43 .",
    "table [ tbl-4 ] gives for each grb the magnitude in each photometric bands , extrapolated at @xmath41 ( see notes on table [ tbl-4 ] ) and corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "we conservatively kept the error on the magnitudes to 0.03 mags when the published error is smaller that this value .",
    "grb 000926 is not part of our bepposax sample because its x - ray data has poor statistics ( see section 2 ) .",
    "however , it has relatively high quality chandra data and a complete optical - nir photometry .",
    "furthermore , grb 000926 has been observed at a medium - high resolution with keck esi ( castro et al .",
    "2003 ) and savaglio et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were able to derive information on the metal column densities from this spectrum .",
    "for these reasons , we decided to include it in our analysis .",
    "we take the photometry of grb 000926 ( u , b , v , r , i , j , h and k ) from fynbo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the galactic extinction in the direction of this burst from the sfd maps as @xmath44 .",
    "the redshift of grb 000926 is @xmath45 ( castro et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the optical to near infrared seds of the nine grb afterglows are shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "in this section we summarize the results of afterglow spectral fitting , performed separately in the x - ray and in the optical - nir energy ranges .",
    "our goal is to estimate the absorption in the soft x - ray energy and extinction in the optical band .      at the time of the nfi observations ( on average after @xmath11 hours after the grb event ,",
    "see table [ tbl-3 ] ) , afterglow x - ray spectra are usually well described by simple power laws .",
    "we therefore performed a spectral fit by adopting a simple power law model with two photoelectric absorption component : one representing the absorption from our galaxy and the other representing the additional absorption along the line of sight .",
    "the quality of the data does not allow to fit for the absorber redshift .",
    "we therefore present in table [ tbl-5 ] ( 0.1 - 10 kev band ) and table [ tbl-6 ] ( 0.4 - 10 kev band ) best fit parameters obtained with the additional absorber at the redshift of the grb , or at z=1 when the redshift of the grb is unknown , since grb redshift distribution peaks at about this value ( djorgovski et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "tables [ tbl-5 ] and [ tbl-6 ] also give the results of the fits performed fixing the redshift of the additional absorbing column to zero .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the best fit additional column density at z=0 against the galactic column .",
    "no trend is evident , supporting the robustness of our analysis .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the best fit additional absorbing column density measured at z=0 and at z = z@xmath46 ( or z=1 for the grb with unknown redshift ) as a function of the redshift . since the photoelectric cross section scales with energy roughly as @xmath24 , effective @xmath2 values scale with redshift as @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , fitting the absorption in the grb frame the resulting column is highly magnified with respect to that fitted at z=0 and small errors in the evaluation of the galactic column would translate in a strong trend of the additional column with z toward high @xmath2 values at high z. this is not observed , supporting the robustness of our analysis .    to evaluate the statistical significance of a given additional @xmath2 measurement we used the f test ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "we found that in two cases , grb 990123 and grb 010222 , the improvement of the @xmath8 including the additional absorber to the fit is highly significant ( figure [ f4 ] ) , probability @xmath48 99.99% . in both cases",
    "the probability remains higher than 99.99% increasing @xmath49 by 16% ( that correspond to 68 % of uncertainty on our estimate of the galactic column along the line of sight , see  3.1.1 ) .",
    "even increasing @xmath49 by 50% ( the highest deviation we expect from our estimates of @xmath49 ) the probability remains higher than 99.99% for grb 010222 and higher than 98 % for grb 990123 .    in three other cases ( grb 980703 , grb 990510 and grb 001109 ) the improvement of the @xmath8 including the additional absorber to the fit is marginally significant ( probability of 97% ) . in all these cases increasing @xmath49 by 16% reduces the statistical significance of the @xmath8 improvement below the threshold of 95% .",
    "we conclude that the detection of absorption in addition to the galactic one is robust against statistical and systematic uncertainties in 2 of the 13 grb analyzed ( grb 990123 and grb 010222 ) .",
    "we note that the spectra of grb 990123 and grb 010222 are also those with the best statistics .",
    "however , fitting the spectra of two other grb afterglows with lower but still reasonably good statistics , grb 971214 and grb 970228 , including an additional absorber , does not produce a significant improvement in @xmath8 ( probability of @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively ) .",
    "for the rest of the sample , additional absorption may be common , although the quality of the data in the majority of the cases does not allow highly significant detection .",
    "assuming that the most of the matter responsible of absorption is at the grb redshift , we found @xmath2 rest frame values in the range @xmath52 @xmath4 ( 90% confidence level ) , similar to the column usually observed toward the disk and the bulge of our galaxy ( see figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis has been performed for this burst which is the second brightest x - ray afterglow of the selected sample and shows a peculiar behavior at low energies ( figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "we note from table [ tbl-5 ] that our @xmath2 measurement for this burst , is somehow lower , but still consistent with the @xmath2 reported by int zand et al .",

    "( 2002 ) @xmath54@xmath4 , using chandra observations ( 0.5 - 10.0 kev ) .",
    "we note , however , that the chandra data are affected by pile - up .",

    "we note that assuming the c or the q1 model , the nir to x - ray sed of grb 010222 is fully consistent with the fireball model , without the need of a strong contribution from inverse compton scattering in the x - ray band ( see eg .",
    "int zand et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the smc model provides good fit to the grb 980519 and grb 971214 data ( by using for the latter both optical and nir data , see  5.2.2 ) .",
    "however , the number of photometric points is smaller than for grb 010222 and grb 000926 and therefore the constraint on the extinction model is less tight .",
    "moreover , the redshift of grb 980519 is unknown and for grb 971214 the interpretation of the spectral break observed between the optical and nir bands is not univoque ( see  4.3 ) . excluding the nir points , both the smc and the c extinction curves provide comparable good fit to grb 971214 .",
    "the small curvatures of the grb 990510 and grb 990123 seds require very low extinction .",
    "no strong constraints on the extinction model can be obtained also in the cases of grb 970228 and grb 980329 because of the few photometric points .",
    "the extinction models tested in our analysis that have a strong 2175   hump are indicated as g and q1 ( see  5.2 and figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "we found that in all the analyzed optical - nir seds , except grb 970508 , the g and q1 model give bad @xmath8 ( see table [ tbl-8 ] ) .",
    "this 2175   hump does not appear to be a common feature in extra galactic sources ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) and there is not yet a clear and univoque interpretation of its absence . in the case of grbs ,",
    "the absence of the 2175    can be explained by the results obtained by perna et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "they find that dust destruction of the small graphite grains due to an intense x - ray / uv source , as could be for grb , would produce a significantly suppression of the 2175   hump .",
    "two bursts in our sample are at unknown redshift : grb 980519 and grb 980329 .",
    "we found that for grb 980519 , a lower redshift ( z@xmath60.7 ) improves , although not very significantly , the quality of the fit using the g and q1 models , because the 2175   hump moves out of the observed frequency range . for grb 980329 , the jump between the r and i photometric points is marginally explained by the 2175   hump redshifted to the optical range ( z@xmath61.8 , see figure [ f9 ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , we have evaluated rest frame optical extinction @xmath5 from the optical to near infrared photometry and rest frame equivalent hydrogen column densities @xmath2 from the x - ray data .",
    "we found that several grb lie well above the @xmath2 versus @xmath5 relationship expected for the galactic extinction curve ( figure [ f10 ] ) . in this",
    "regard our results are qualitatively similar to those of galama & wijers ( 2001 ) , although the best fit @xmath2 values are somewhat smaller than those reported by the latter authors , and visual extinction are evaluated here using detailed extinction curves ( while galama & wijers ( 2001 ) assume a linear extinction curve @xmath146 and computed rest frame @xmath2 by using a simple power law scaling of the @xmath2 measured in the observer frame ) .",
    "scenarios that can reconcile the observed x - ray absorption with the lack of strong optical extinction , involve the presence of a dust to gas ratio much lower than the galactic one ( see figure [ f6 ] ) , and/or of a dust grain size distribution skewed toward large grains .",
    "we discuss these two possibilities in turn .",
    "a dust to gas ratio much lower than the galactic one has been tested assuming the smc extinction curve . in fact , for the smc ism it has been inferred a dust content @xmath147 of the galactic one ( pei 1992 ) . a good agreement between the best fit @xmath2 and @xmath5 is obtained using this extinction curve ( figure [ f11 ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that the best fit @xmath2 values have been obtained by assuming galactic metal abundances , while the metallicity of the smc ism is @xmath135 the galactic one ( pei 1992 ) .",
    "if such low metallicity were assumed , best fit @xmath2 values became @xmath148 times higher than those quoted in tables 5 and 6 as plotted in figure [ f11 ] ( dashed line ) , worsening the agreement with the best fit optical extinction .",
    "we can therefore conclude that also for an smc - like ism the observed extinction is significantly lower than predicted from the x - ray column density .",
    "large grains give gray opacity from optical to the infrared ( e.g. kim , martin & hendry 1994 , weingartner & draine 2000 , maiolino et al .",
    "2001a ) , that could explain the small curvature observed in the optical afterglow seds .",
    "a low @xmath149 supports the scenario were large grains are formed by coagulation mechanisms ( e.g. kim & martin 1996 , maiolino et al .",
    "since the grain coagulation rate increases with density as @xmath150 ( draine 1985 ) , the depletion of small grains by coagulation mechanisms is expected to be particularly efficient in high density environments , as the giant molecular clouds which could harbor grb events .",
    "high density gas and dust coagulation is not the only viable mechanism to produce a dust grain size distribution skewed toward large grains .",
    "if the dust to metal ratio is constant , as in the galaxy and the two magellanic clouds ism ( pei 1992 ) , the lack of strong extinction ( dust ) , along with a consistent amount of x - ray absorption ( metal ) , suggest a scenario were dust is destroyed by the intense grb x - ray / uv flux .",
    "dust grains may be heated and evaporated by the intense x - ray and uv radiation field up to @xmath151 ( waxmann & draine 2000 , draine & hao 2002 , fruchter , krolik & rhoads 2001 ) .",
    "perna et al . ( 2002b ) and perna & lazzati ( 2002c ) show that the result of the exposure of dust to the intense grb radiation field can be a grain size distribution flatter that the original one .",
    "the main reason is that dust destruction is more efficient on small grains .",
    "perna et al . ( 2002b ) computed the extinction curve which is obtained if standard galactic dust is exposed to a grb , and found that the dust extinction curve can be very flat , at least for burst lasting more than a few tens of seconds .",
    "we tested a dust model skewed toward large grains using the model q1 adapted from maiolino et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the x - ray @xmath2 agree very well with the hydrogen column density expected from the best fit @xmath5 and the visual extinction - reddening ratio appropriate for this model ( see figure [ f12 ] ) .",
    "we note that this model does not imply a metallicity lower than solar , thus providing a self consistent solution , unless the smc - like ism .",
    "however , the q1 curve gives generally worse @xmath8 ( see table 7 and 8) than the smc and c models .",
    "this is mainly due to the presence of a strong 2175   hump in the q1 model .",
    "the c extinction curve has a slope similar to that of the q1 model ( figure [ f6 ] ) , but no 2175 hump , thus providing better fits",
    ". this difference does not affect the rest frame extinction estimates , whose values from both models are indeed comparable ( see table 7 and 8) and suggests that an extinction model with a `` flat '' slope and no 2175   hump would produce both good fits to most observed seds and a nice agreement between @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "in the near future we will have the chance to confirm this intriguing scenario .",
    "_ swift _ will enable us to obtain high quality x - ray spectra of the afterglow as a function of the time .",
    "the _ swift _ optical monitor will allow us to obtain precise and reliable optical - uv photometry .",
    "robotic telescopes like rem , triggered by _",
    "swift _ , will be able to obtain simultaneous near infrared photometry",
    ". therefore it will be possible to obtain precise reddening measures , constraining the correct extinction law , and to follow the evolution of the reddening as a function of the time , that is the smoking gun of a possible grb uv / x - ray flux influence on their environment .",
