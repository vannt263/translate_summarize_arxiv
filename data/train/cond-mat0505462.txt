    "since last decade and until today , one important goal of modern research in condensed matter is to find a good quantitative description of the glassy dynamics in liquids .",
    "theoretically there is a established theory , the so - called mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , that can describe and predict important parameters and quantities in glassy systems qualitatively good .",
    "work in the last decade has provided evidence  @xcite that mct  @xcite is able to describe the slow dynamics of _ fragile _ liquids in the weakly supercooled state .",
    "the recent work of kob et.al.@xcite has also showed that theory able to accurately describe the non - ergodicity parameters of simple as well as of network - forming liquids .",
    "the one important statement of the mct is that the dynamics processes at long times is driven by a memory kernel which is included in mct s integro - differential equation .    in previously paper @xcite we have studied the memory kernel of incoherent intermediate scattering function .",
    "further , we have compared the memory kernels @xmath2 evaluated from the mct formula with the kernels @xmath3 from inverting the time evolution of the intermediate scattering functions .",
    "the comparison shows encouraging agreement at 900 to 1100 k while significant deviations are found at 1200 k. it is an open question whether for this temperature an improved agreement between calculated @xmath2 and estimated @xmath3 can be obtained by inclusion of the coupling to transversal currents in the memory kernel formula as provided , e.g. , by gudowski et.al . @xcite .    the main objective of paper is to give one of the answer of above open question .",
    "but instead of the memory kernel of incoherent intermediate scattering function , we investigated the memory kernel @xmath4 of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) for temperature @xmath5  k. by calculating the memory kernel we included all coupling as proposed by sjgren und sjolander s mode - coupling(mc)-model @xcite .",
    "the calculated memory function then is compared with the kernel from inverting the time evolution of vacf .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sim ] , we present the model and give some details of the computations .",
    "section [ theo ] gives a brief discussion of some aspects of the sjgren und sjolander s mode - coupling(mc)-model as used here .",
    "results of our md - simulations and their analysis are then presented and discussed in section [ rd ] .",
    "as we know , the vacf can be studied through the formalism developed by zwanzig and mori @xcite , which is based on a following integral equation : @xmath6    in this paper the sjgren und sjolander s ( ss ) mode - coupling(mc)-model @xcite is used . in this model memory kernel @xmath4 of vacf @xmath7",
    "was proposed for a simple liquid according to a combination of kinetic and mode coupling concepts .",
    "the basic idea of the model is that memory - kernel can be divided into two term .",
    "the first term comes from the uncorrelated binray collisions and the other from correlated collisions .",
    "the former is related to the fast decay of kernel at short times .",
    "the latter is expresses the mode - coupling term which incorporate more sophisticated processes that appear at longer times .",
    "moreover , this term is based on the idea that the motion of a tagged particle is influenced by constraints collectively imposed by its neighboring particles .",
    "the memory kernel @xmath4 of vacf take also the following relation @xmath8    according to ss - model the mode - coupling effects take into account four different coupling - term : density - density coupling , two contributions from density - longitudinal current couplings , and density - transverse current coupling ( s. sjgren ( 1980/81 ) @xcite , gudowski et.al .",
    "( 1993 ) @xcite , canales et.al .",

    ", we follow method used by sjgren ( 1980/81 ) , gudowski et.al .",
    "( 1993 ) , canales et.al .",
    "if by these authors one atomic systems only were investigated , here we investigate a binary system .",
    "also we have to develop and construct the formulation of coupling terms for our binary system .    here",
    "are the results of our reformulation of @xmath4 for our binary system .",
    "the binary term is defined by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the einstein - frequency of @xmath11-component @xcite , @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be determined by the following equation @xmath14    the coupling terms is expressed by @xmath15 here @xmath16 describes the density - density coupling , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the density - longitudinal currents couplings , and @xmath19 the density - transverse current coupling .",
