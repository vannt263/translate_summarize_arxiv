    "iras 182761431 ( hereafter i18276 ) , also known as oh 17.72.0 , is an oxygen - rich proto(pre)-planetary nebula ( ppn ) .",
    "this object has been well studied in maser observations over the past three decades since its discovery as a strong oh 1612  mhz source @xcite .",
    "no sio maser has been detected @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the h@xmath18o maser dropped by a factor of a hundred during the period between 1985 and 1990 and is now undetectable , indicating that the mass - loss rate has rapidly decreased to below 10@xmath19yr@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these maser properties suggest that the central star evolved off the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase very recently .",
    "the dust shell of this object has also been the subject of several studies .",
    "* hereafter sc07 ) presented optical _",
    "hst / wfpc2 _ images and infrared @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 images from the keck ii telescope .",
    "the images show a striking bipolar appearance with an extension of @xmath162 arcsec@xmath233 arcsec .",
    "while the extension and the appearance look similar in these shorter wavelength ranges , the mid - infrared images at 8.59  @xmath2 m , 11.85  @xmath2 m , and 12.81  @xmath2 m show an elongated shape along the polar direction with a flux peak towards the central star @xcite .",
    "sc07 also performed a one - dimensional ( 1d ) double shell model that mainly fits the mid - infrared flux .",
    "they found that the observed fluxes between 800  @xmath2 m and 2.6  mm are roughly proportional to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the frequency , indicating the opacity coefficient @xmath26 .",
    "hence , they concluded that the dust grains with radii @xmath27 m could explain the flux slope at these wavelengths .",
    "the dust growth in the circumstellar environment is an interesting issue .",
    "if the ejected material radially expands at typical expansion velocities of @xmath1615  kms@xmath15 , the dust particles may only grow a little and retain the properties that were set in the dust formation region .",
    "that is to say , particles with sizes up to a few micron should exist .",
    "this is confirmed in several previous papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "bipolar objects such as i18276 are expected to have an optically thick , long - lived dust torus or disc around the central star , which is thought to have formed because of binary interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in such a thick dusty region",
    ", the dust grows in size by mutual collisions . although the formation of the disc@xmath28torus and the dust processes therein have been studied in various object classes , they are still under debate and present some intriguing problems .    in the present work , we investigate the dust properties in i18276 s circumstellar dust shell ( cds ) by means of two - dimensional ( 2d ) radiative transfer calculations .",
    "an approximate solution was obtained by sc07 s 1d sed model .",
    "however , since i18276 exhibits a striking bipolar lobe , we explore 2d modeling .",
    "furthermore , the spectral slope of the ( sub)millimeter flux is often used to detect large grains of a few hundred micron or larger . in our modeling , we encounter difficulties explaining the millimeter flux excess and the fluxes at far - infrared or shorter wavelengths simultaneously with a reasonable mass of the material in the equatorial region .",
    "we will revisit the spectral slope issue .",
    "we performed 2d radiative transfer modeling of i18276 s cds .",
    "our aim is to investigate the dust properties in the envelope and the equatorial region .",
    "an analysis of the arc - like structure and the `` search light '' feature , which are detected in previous optical and nir images ( sc07 ) , and the formation of bipolarity are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "a comprehensive discussion on the morphology can be found in sc07 .",
    "our modeling approach is basically similar to our previous work @xcite .",
    "we used nir polarimetric data obtained with vlt@xmath28naco , these data are particularly useful to estimate the dust sizes .",
    "this is complemented by sed data collected from various sources .",

    "figure[modelsed ] shows the sed of i18276 , it has a single flux peak at @xmath1625  @xmath2 m and a weak 10  @xmath2 m absorption feature . in this plot , the interstellar reddening , which is calculated to be 1.6(@xmath80.5 )  mag at @xmath29 ( sc07 ) , is used to correct the measured fluxes for wavelengths shorter than 5  @xmath2 m .",
    "the upper panels of fig.[modelimg ] present the nir images , which are collected from the vlt@xmath28naco data archive .",
    "the natural seeing was 0.5 arcsec to 0.6 arcsec in the optical during the observations , which is typical for the paranal site .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band data were taken with the wollaston prism to measure the polarisation .",
    "the data were reduced following the same method as before @xcite .",
    "standard star data were used to calibrate the surface brightness and the polarisation , and also served to estimate the size of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the measured full widths at half maximum of the beam are 0.1 arcsec , 0.058 arcsec , and 0.063 arcsec in the @xmath30 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bands , respectively .",
    "the psfs were modeled using one - dimensional moffat function fitting .",
    "the psf size 2@xmath31 and slope @xmath7 are obtained to be 0.146 arcsec and 1.17 in the @xmath30-band , 0.074 arcsec and 1.18 in the @xmath0-band , and 0.048 arcsec and 1.03 in the @xmath1-band .",
    "the model images are convolved with the model psf which allows comparison with the observed images .",
    "the intensity images show a striking bipolar appearance and look similar in the @xmath30 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bands , consistent with previous observations ( e.g.sc07 ) . for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band images ,",

    "the vectors are aligned perpendicularly to the bipolar axis .",
    "the polarisation reaches 50  60  % and does not change much between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",

    ", we aim to fit the shape of the sed including the weak 10  @xmath2 m silicate feature , the constant bipolar appearance and degree of polarisation in the nir .          the spectral type and the total luminosity of the central star",
    "are estimated to be @xmath16k5 or earlier and @xmath16@xmath32 , respectively @xcite .",
    "previous oh maser phase - lag measurements yielded a distance in the range 3.4 to 5.4  kpc @xcite . in our model",
    ", the central star is assumed to have a blackbody spectrum with 7000  k , which is an intermediate value of the previous estimates of 4000  k to 10000  k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we adopted the distance to be 3  kpc following sc07 , yielding a luminosity of 6380  @xmath33 .",
    "we will start with this value , but will eventually use 8500  @xmath33 to better fit the sed .    in bipolar ppns such as i18276 , it is expected that the cds has an optically thick dust torus@xmath28disc in the equatorial region and an envelope , which characterises the lobe shape . in our separate paper on the bipolar ppn iras 163423814 , we needed an additional optically thick , geometrically thin disc inside the torus @xcite . for i18276 , we tried both model geometries , but found that the inner disc is not necessary . the mass density form for i18276 is assumed to be @xmath34 .",
    "we apply a mass density form @xmath35 for the torus , where @xmath36 are the two - dimensional cylindrical coordinates , and the torus region is defined as @xmath37 .",
    "we would like to stress that the dust particle motions in the torii of evolved stars are not well known .",
    "for example , it is not clear whether they are accreting onto the star , expanding , or rotating in a keplerian fashion , or not .",
    "hence , we regard the torus just as a tapered dust structure . for the envelope ,",
    "we assume a spherical agb shell in the outer part and a pair of bipolar lobes inside the agb shell .",
    "this is because the mass - loss rate rapidly increases at the very end of the thermal pulsing agb phase .",
    "the lobe is then carved out by the fast wind when the star evolves to the post - agb phase . the bipolar appearance is mainly characterised by the lobe structure .",
    "the mass density forms of the lobe and agb shell are given by equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in our i16342 paper , respectively .",
    "they are determined by the density coefficient , @xmath38 , the density ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 , for the inner cavity and the rim of the lobe ; the lobe shape , @xmath7 , the lobe thickness , @xmath41 , the lobe size , @xmath42 , and the outer radius @xmath43 .",

    "we would like to stress that it is very difficult to find a parameter set that reproduces all aspects of the observations . because our aim is to investigate the dust properties , our modeling",
    "is mostly concerned with explaining the nir polarisation and the sed over a wide wavelength range .",
    "the images in the optical and mir are not accurately reproduced .",
    "the derived parameters are : @xmath71  au , @xmath72  au , @xmath73 , @xmath74 m , @xmath75 m , the optical depth in the torus midplane is 52 at 5.0  @xmath2 m , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 m .",
    "the viewing angle measured from the polar axis is @xmath78 .",
    "table [ model_parm ] lists these parameters and uncertainties .",
    "we briefly summarise the selected model results in this section and discuss the effects of dust sizes on the model results in detail in sect.[dustprop ] .",
    "the sed of the selected model is plotted with black lines in fig.[modelsed ] .",
    "the aperture sizes used for the photometric and spectroscopic data are different for the various observations ; they are 4 arcsec in radius ( for 2mass ) or larger . because the apparent size of the nebulosity is small and most flux",
    "is concentrated within @xmath161 arcsec , the effect of aperture size on the observed sed is negligible in i18276 .",
    "in fact , the model flux derived applying a 4 arcsec aperture differs less than 1  % from that applying an infinite aperture from optical to millimetre wavelengths .",
    "the model fits the observed sed well apart from the optical .",
    "the weak 10  @xmath2 m feature is due to a filling in the underlying absorption with strong thermal emission .",
    "in fact , the mir images show a flux peak towards the central star @xcite and the calculated optical depth becomes high as 41 at 10  @xmath2 m .",
    "the red line denotes the result of the selected model but with only the torus , e.g.@xmath49 is simply set to be 0 .",
    "it approximately indicates the contribution from the torus in the selected model . in the wavelengths shorter than @xmath169  @xmath2 m and between @xmath169  @xmath2 m and @xmath16200  @xmath2 m , the scattered light and thermal emission from the envelope , respectively ,",
    "the sed of the selected model fits the observations comparably well in the nir and longer wavelengths .",
    "however , a large discrepancy is seen in the optical . in some models with other parameter sets , e.g.@xmath79 m dust for the torus and a shallower power index of the mass density distribution in the envelope , we find that these models can fit the sed in the optical better than the selected model . however , these models provide poorer fits to the images or the mir fluxes .    the bottom panels in fig.[modelimg ] show the model results .",
    "the pair of bipolar lobes and a nearly constant appearance from @xmath30 to @xmath1 bands are reproduced .",
    "the optical and mir images are also reproduced although they are not presented .",
    "the bipolarity is seen in the optical , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 bands . on the other hand",
    ", the 11.85  @xmath2 m image shows a single peak .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with the observations ( sc07 and * ? ? ?",
    "however the details of the surface brightness structures of the images are not accurately reproduced because the images at these wavelengths are not used to strictly constrain the model parameters .",
    "the polarisation vectors are aligned perpendicular to the bipolar axis in the entire nebulosity . since",
    "a centro - symmetric pattern is seen in the raw images , this alignment is due to the psf smoothing effect , as is also demonstrated in our i16342 paper @xcite .",
    "the polarisation in the bipolar lobes reaches 50  65  % , which is slightly higher than the observations .",
    "if @xmath80 m is used , the polarisation becomes 45  60  % .",
    "we confirm that our estimation of the particle size in the envelope is consistent with that by @xcite .",
    "we reach an important conclusion with respect to the particle sizes . * in the envelope , the mass fraction of the particles with radius larger than the cutoff size ( @xmath77 m ) is 28  % .",
    "this fraction decreases dramatically for larger sizes , e.g.only 1.7  % for @xmath81 m .",
    "the submicron sized dust dominates in the envelope . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of the particles larger than 400  @xmath2 m is high as 81  % for the torus .",
    "hence , the particles in the torus are expected to be significantly larger than in the envelope . * in sect.[dustlobe ] , we discuss the effect of the power index , @xmath5 , on the polarization and provide our interpretation on the derived @xmath5 of 5.5 . in sect.[dusttorus ] , we discuss the determination of the particle sizes using the millimeter flux excess and the problems encountered in our modeling .",
    "in nir polarimetric images of bipolar reflection nebulae such as those seen around for example evolved stars , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , and active galactic nuclei , the polarisation vectors are centro - symmetrically aligned and the degree of linear polarisation reaches @xmath82  % in general .",
    "this result is explained by single scattering off submicron - sized dust particles .",
    "the polarisation is sensitive to the dust size , or to be more precise , the size parameter @xmath83 for @xmath84 . in the case of ysos ,",
    "a strong wavelength dependence of the polarisation is seen which can be explained with a size distribution function : @xmath69 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this value for the exponent can be readily understood because the dust in the yso envelope originates from interstellar matter .",
    "in contrast , weak wavelength dependencies are found in some evolved stars .",
    "the polarisation ranges from 35 to 60  % in the optical to nir in frosty leo @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a steeper power index @xmath5 ranging from 5.2 to 5.5 .",
    "we now investigate the effects of the dust sizes and the size distribution function on polarisation .",
    "two models are considered : g1 has 0.05  @xmath2 m @xmath3 and @xmath85 , and g2 has 0.005  @xmath2 m @xmath86 m and @xmath69 .",
    "upper limits of the dust size @xmath65 or @xmath60 of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.7  @xmath2 m are examined .",
    "figure  [ scat ] presents the resulting polarisation .",
    "the degree of polarisation @xmath87 is calculated using the ratio of @xmath88 to @xmath89 at the scattering angle that maximises the polarisation , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the scattering matrix elements for spherical grains @xcite .",
    "these values should be the upper limit of the polarisation expected in the envelope because the scattered light at various scattering angles is integrated in the observed data .",
    "in fact , the polarisation values in our model are 50  65  % in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , but the above calculations give 70  80  % .",
    "g2 has a strong wavelength dependence in the optical to the nir , as is observed in yso envelopes . on the other hand",
    ", g1 has a weak dependence in wavelength and dust size .",
    "the scattering properties are determined by the relative fractions of small and large dust .",
    "the scattering matrix elements @xmath91 are weighted with @xmath92 by @xmath93 . in g2 the scattering property is dominated by the dust at the maximum sizes .",
    "the polarisation varies rapidly around @xmath84 , e.g.@xmath94 m for @xmath95 m . it is of interest that in fact the polarisations can not be simultaneously fit in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands if the g2 dust is applied in the envelope in our modeling .",
    "for example , whereas the @xmath96 m model reproduces the @xmath0 band polarization with a value of @xmath97  % , the model returns a too high @xmath98 band polarization of @xmath99  % .",
    "the 0.5  @xmath2 m dust models , instead , reproduce the @xmath98 band polarization and return @xmath100  % , however they result in too low @xmath101  % .",
    "we see large discrepancies despite a small difference of @xmath160.1  @xmath2 m in the @xmath60 values . on the other hand ,",
    "the g1 model has a larger fraction of small particles ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus , the polarisations are higher even at shorter wavelengths , i.e.@xmath103 m . in contrast , lower polarisations are obtained at longer wavelengths ( @xmath104 m ) because of the large particles , even though the fractions are low .",
    "it is also useful to note that the polarisations of the g1 models are lower than those of g2 at @xmath105 m even with the same upper limit sizes .",
    "this is because dust models with the kmh - like size distribution function have particles with sizes exceeding @xmath65 .",
    "if a steeper power index , e.g.@xmath106 , is assumed in the mrn - type dust model , the scattering properties at longer wavelengths ( @xmath107 ) consequently becomes similar to those with a shallower power index .",
    "we reach two conclusions .",
    "first , in objects that show a weak wavelength dependence in their envelopes such as i18276 and frosty leo , a steep power index @xmath108 is expected in the size distribution function .",
    "second , if the polarisation is measured over a wider wavelength range such as from the optical to 3 to 5  @xmath2 m , which is still in the scattering regime in cool dust regions , the size distribution functions are better constrained , e.g.the lower limit and whether the mrn - type or the kmh - type is more favoured .",
    "this brings us to the more general question whether the dust properties depend on the objects under consideration .",
    "a nir polarimetric survey of a dozen of ppns was presented @xcite .",
    "four objects ( iras 17436 + 5003 , iras 19114 + 0002 , iras 18095 + 2704 , and iras 195001709 ) out of seven for which the nebulosity is spatially resolved , show nearly constant polarisations in the @xmath30 and @xmath98 bands . including three other objects ( frosty leo , i16342 , and i18276 ) , a weak wavelength dependence on polarisation is detected .",
    "we thus find similar polarisation behaviour for different morphologies , i.e.spherical , elliptic , and bipolar , while all objects except for iras 195001709 are oxygen - rich .",
    "differences in morphology are thought to result from the different initial stellar mass , i.e.the higher the mass , the more asymmetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these observational results suggest that the initial stellar mass and the dust shell morphology do not play important roles in determining the dust size distribution function .",
    "the power index of @xmath163 that is found in the interstellar medium @xcite is thought to be the result of dust formation process of mass - losing evolved stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite analysed the dust size spectrum in the dust - driven winds of carbon rich stars . in their models ,",
    "dust particles form via nucleation at @xmath109 , the size distribution function rapidly approaches the final distribution within @xmath1620  @xmath57 .",
    "they found that the size distribution functions are proportional to @xmath110 in the case without drift between the gas and dust motions and to @xmath111 in the case with drift .",
    "their results show that large drift velocities steepen the size distribution function because they can break up large particles by sputtering .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that in oxygen - rich winds , the radiation pressure on the dust is too weak to drive the wind because of low dust opacities .",
    "in fact , survey observations of a large number of agb stars and mass - loss models have shown that expansion velocities are lower in oxygen - rich stars @xcite , suggesting lower drift velocities in oxygen - rich stars than the carbon - rich objects . at first glance , this is in the opposite sense to the result that the majority of the objects where steeper power indices are found are oxygen - rich in the aforementioned polarisation survey .",
    "follow up observations of various objects , i.e.c-@xmath28o - rich , and various stellar luminosities , mass - loss rates , and evolutionary stages , and further analyses of the dust formation and stellar wind are essential .",
    "although we are not in a position to identify the physical reasons , one may expect that shattering or sputtering works efficiently in the circumstellar environments in objects like i18276 .",
    ".dust model parameters for the torus [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spectral opacity index @xmath7 and the mass absorptive opacity @xmath112 are values at @xmath113  mm .",

    "in addition , if the dust opacity has a power - law dependence on frequency , @xmath125 , the flux is given by @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",
    "this can be obtained when the ratio of the optically thick to thin emission , @xmath128 , is neglected in the result derived by @xcite .    with the observed flux data of i18276 from @xmath129 m to 2.6  mm",

    "the behaviour of @xmath7 does not change much for @xmath133 m .",
    "an anomalous @xmath134 is seen at 100  @xmath2 m @xmath135 m .",
    "this is due to a sudden drop in the opacity at @xmath84 , as seen in the top panel . for @xmath136",

    "we encounter the serious problem that the nir flux can not be reasonably fit .",
    "the reason is that the extinction cross section of this dust model is too low in the nir",
    ". it would be easier to understand this using our selected model as reference .",
    "the optical depth of the torus is found to be 52 at 5.0  @xmath2 m . to fit the nir flux with a dust model other than that used for the selected model , the optical depth of the torus",

    "whereas @xmath114 of the dust model a ( the selected model shown in figure[modelsed ] ) , is high at 103  cm@xmath55g@xmath15 , that for model b , which fits @xmath7 , is only 4.54  cm@xmath55g@xmath15 .",
    "the torus mass for model b is required to be unreliably large at 68.1  @xmath14 .",

    "the torus is massive . even if a binary companion with mass of @xmath161  @xmath14 is assumed to exist in i18276 s stellar system , it is unlikely that the derived torus has a pure keplerian rotating motion .",
    "rather a large fraction of the torus material should be radially expanding .",
    "a hydrodynamic simulation of a binary interacted outflow model shows a spiral structure in agb shells even in the models that are classified as bipolar @xcite .",
    "similar features are detected in some agb shells , e.g. ngc  3068 @xcite and r  scl @xcite , although these are optically thin cases .",
    "in addition , up to now , a keplerian rotating motion is detected only for the red rectangle @xcite while other objects are found to have expanding motions for which the velocity is well studied from observations .",

    "we briefly highlight the problem of dust growth in the torus . in some objects , for which large grains are detected , e.g. the red rectangle @xcite and afgl  2688 @xcite , a long - lived disc is also expected to be present .",
    "this is a quite natural expectation because the dust particles have a larger chance to collide and grow in size in a disc than in an expanding outflow , although this is still hypothesised .",
    "however , as mentioned above , only for the red rectangle a stable rotating disc is detected .",
    "the red rectangle s keplerian rotating disc is spatially resolved by co emission line radio interferometry @xcite .",
    "these authors estimate a disc mass of 0.04  @xmath14 , a radius of 560  au , and a central mass of @xmath160.9  @xmath14 .",
    "this system is somewhat similar to the solar nebula besides the stellar luminosity .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , in some objects like i18276 ( this work ) and iras 22036 + 5306 @xcite , in which large fractions of large grains are expected in the torus , the torus mass is very high ( @xmath156 ) and expansion motions are detected .",
    "further studies , in which the dust growth theory should be optimised for the circumstellar environment around evolved stars , are encouraged to better understand such massive large particles in the tori of these objects .",

    "the previously observed sed and nir polarimetric images were used to constrain the physical parameters .",
    "the primary aim of our work was to investigate the dust properties .",
    "the polarisation reaches 50  60  % in the bipolar lobes and",
    "is almost constant in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "this weak wavelength dependence and high values can be reproduced by dust models with a steeper power index of 5.5 of the size distribution function than interstellar dust . if the dust in i18276 s envelope has conserved its properties since its formation during the agb phase , mechanisms that break up large grains and increase the fraction of small particles , such as sputtering , may have also acted .",
    "polarization measurements at a large wavelength range for various object classes of c - rich and o - rich , and agb stars to pns will provide better constraints of the size distribution functions and will help our understanding of the dust formation and process in circumstellar environments .",
    "we also investigated the dust properties in the torus .",
    "two candidate dust models were examined .",
    "one has a size distribution function of @xmath157 and @xmath158 m and the spectral opacity index @xmath7 of 0.633 .",
    "this model agrees with the observed @xmath7 of 0.6 from the 760  @xmath2 m to 2.6  mm fluxes , however , it reproduces too low infrared flux because the opacity is too small .",
    "the other dust model has @xmath69 and @xmath159 m and fits the sed over a wide wavelength range besides the ( sub)millimeter opacity slope ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the torus masses are large for both models ; 2.59  @xmath14 ( former ) and 3.0  @xmath14 ( latter ) . in this massive torus ,",
    "the material is probably radially expanding rather than purely rotating around the central star , as is expected in the previous co emission line observations .",
    "if the expansion velocity of 15  kms@xmath15 , which is an intermediate value of the previous estimations , is assumed , the torus has been formed in @xmath16300  yrs with a mass loss rate of @xmath16@xmath161yr@xmath15 .",
