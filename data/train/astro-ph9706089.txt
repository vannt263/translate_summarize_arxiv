    "it is likely that gas observed in the central regions of elliptical galaxies is dominated by magnetic stresses .",
    "the chaotic , non - equilibrium appearance of dusty clouds of cool gas apparent in hst observations in the cores of many elliptical galaxies ( e.g. van dokkum & franx 1995 ) is often ascribed to the effects of a recent merger .",
    "however , it may be more likely that the disorganized appearance of these clouds reflects the well known inability of magnetic fields to reach quiescent configurations in differentially rotating , gravitationally bound fluids .",
    "in addition it is plausible that strong magnetic forces in the gas that cools near the centers of elliptical galaxies may influence the initial mass function or other aspects of star formation associated with galactic cooling flows .",
    "the interstellar medium in ellipticals and its magnetic field can be regarded as a result of cumulative stellar mass loss from an evolving population of old stars .",
    "gas ejected from orbiting stars thermalizes a significant fraction of its kinetic energy and settles into a quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium with temperatures near the virial temperature of the galactic potential , @xmath3 k. the hot gas then loses energy by emitting the thermal x - rays that are observed and slowly sinks in the galactic potential where it is compressed and maintained approximately isothermal . although these subsonic inflows are commonly referred to as galactic `` cooling flows , '' the cooling occurs only in the central regions where radiative losses finally overwhelm compressional heating .",
    "the hot interstellar medium in elliptical galaxies operates like a magnetic distillery , first amplifying fields introduced in stellar ejecta then concentrating this magnetic energy in high density gas near the center of the galactic cooling flow where intense radiative cooling occurs .",
    "small fields contained in winds and planetary nebulae expelled from red giants are thought to be amplified further by turbulent motions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . even in the presence of",
    "turbulent amplification magnetic stresses at large galactic radii are expected to be small compared to the pressure in the hot interstellar gas .",
    "however , the interstellar gas compresses as it slowly flows toward the galactic center and the field strength must also grow by flux conservation @xmath4 .",
    "the ratio of magnetic to ( isothermal ) gas pressure also increases with gas density , @xmath5 . finally , as gas cools near the central parts of the cooling flow , the thermal support of the gas drops precipitously and magnetic stresses are distilled out to support the remaining ionized gas against gravity and external gas pressure .",
    "soker & sarazin ( 1990 ) discussed the spherical , steady state evolution of completely disordered , frozen - in fields in cluster - scale cooling flows .",
    "they chose the field strength to be 1 @xmath6 g at a radius of 50 kpc . within @xmath7 kpc in their models the magnetic pressure grew by compression in the cooling flow to be comparable to the gas pressure , but further amplification was not thought to be possible because of loss of field by reconnection . since the cooling flow accelerates as the galactic center",
    "is approached , soker & sarazin noted that an initially random field would develop a large scale radial component .",
    "more recently christodoulou & sarazin ( 1996 ) computed the time - dependent evolution of large scale toroidal and axial fields in cluster cooling flows adapted to cylindrical geometry .",
    "although @xmath8 may be small relative to the local gas pressure , the origin of @xmath9 g fields assumed by soker & sarazin and christodoulou & sarazin at the start of their calculations must be understood . primordial field production prior to galaxy formation results in much smaller fields ( @xmath10 g ) ( rees 1987 ; lesch & chiba 1995 ) .",
    "but the high metallicity in gas in clusters of galaxies implies that much of this gas was enriched and expelled by type ii supernovae out of galaxies in which interstellar field growth mechanisms were already available .",
    "thus cluster - scale magnetic fields probably have their origin in fields generated in the ism of cluster galaxies .",
    "our interest here is to explore the growth of interstellar magnetic fields in individual elliptical galaxies in a self - consistent fashion beginning with small seed fields contained in stellar ejecta .",
    "we assume that stellar dynamos are efficient in producing fields in stellar envelopes .",
    "stellar mass loss eventually transports these fields into the ism where the field strength is greatly diminished by adiabatic expansion .",
    "however , recent theoretical work ( lesch & bender 1990 ; moss & shukurov 1996 ) has suggested that some the kinetic and thermal energy that accompanies stellar mass loss processes in ellipticals can also drive turbulent motions in the ism which in turn amplify the magnetic field to @xmath11 g . in this paper",
    "we shall assume with these authors that relatively small interstellar magnetic fields can grow by this turbulent dynamo .",
    "we describe how large scale fields may develop from random fields , but we suppose for simplicity that most of the field remains random on small spatial scales ( @xmath12 kpc say ) .",
    "the growth of magnetic forces in the ism may ultimately be limited by field reconnection which we allow for in an approximate way .",
    "unfortunately , the physical processes that control the turbulent growth of galactic magnetic fields are poorly understood and controversial . in our galaxy",
    "the mean field @xmath13 dynamo has been used to describe the amplification of small seed fields to equipartition with interstellar turbulence ( ruzmaikin , shukurov , & sokoloff 1988 ) .",
    "equipartition of magnetic and turbulent energy densities is in fact observed .",
    "fields in spiral disks can grow both by turbulence and differential rotation .",
    "enhancement of very small seed fields ( @xmath14 g ) by the turbulent dynamo process is attractive because amplification by differential rotation in the galactic disk is limited by the relatively few rotations ( 50 - 100 times ) experienced by the galaxy during its lifetime .",
    "however , several authors ( vainshtein & cattaneo 1992 ; kulsrud & anderson 1992 ) have argued that the linear turbulent dynamo can not amplify very small seed fields to equipartition values .",
    "kulsrud & anderson assert , for example , that the field strength can grow exponentially with time to equipartition only on small spatial scales where it is dissipated into heat while the mean field at intermediate and large spatial scales grows to saturation far below equipartition values .",
    "the ( damping ) reaction of the field on the background hydrodynamic turbulence is also considered .",
    "these authors claim that the failure of dynamo theory to account for fields of equipartition strength implies that galactic fields must be primordial . but",
    "fields expected in proto - galactic gas are likely to be much lower than those currently observed ( lesch & chiba 1995 ; beck et al . 1996 ) . field ( 1995 )",
    "has reviewed this apparent difficulty with the mean field dynamo theory and suggests that a more appropriate application of the kulsrud - anderson formalism would be to study the _ steady - state _ distribution of spectral field components in response to a constant input of turbulent energy on large scales .",
    "but an extension of the theory to include non - linear terms may also be necessary . in their recent comprehensive review of galactic fields",
    "beck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) note the apparent inadequacy of the linear theory in addressing turbulent growth ; a non - linear turbulent dynamo theory would include inverse cascade of small scale field energy to larger scales as well as non - linear aspects of small scale dissipation . finally , beck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) note that fields observed in the galactic ism are not concentrated to small spatial scales as the linear turbulent dynamo theory would predict .    in view of these difficulties and possible shortcomings of mean field dynamo theory ,",
    "we adopt here a simplified model that allows turbulent growth of mean interstellar fields in elliptical galaxies . we are encouraged to take this deliberately optimistic approach by analogy with equipartition fields observed in the ism of our own galaxy and by the arguments of moss & shukurov ( 1996 ) and others that turbulent dynamos are likely to be effective in elliptical galaxies . by assuming the validity of turbulent dynamos",
    ", we can estimate the ( maximum ) field strengths expected in the ism of elliptical galaxies from internal processes alone ; no _ ad hoc _ initial galactic field is required .",
    "we have been motivated to study the evolution of magnetic fields in ellipticals by our recent work on the nature of cooling flows in slowly rotating ellipticals ( brighenti & mathews 1996 ) .",
    "we showed there that a small rotation of the stellar component , similar to those observed in most large ellipticals ( @xmath15 km s@xmath16 ) , causes the interstellar gas to cool onto a very large disk comparable in size to the half - light radius .",
    "most of the new gas reaching the disk arrives at its outer edge so that the cooling disk slowly grows with the age of the galaxy .",
    "as hot gas approaches the relatively high density regions near the outer edge of the cooling disk , its thermal x - ray image resembles a bright disk or torus in the equatorial plane . near the equatorial plane the gas spins up to the circular velocity which is much larger ( @xmath17 km s@xmath16 ) than that of the stellar system .",
    "we estimated that a small , dynamically insignificant magnetic field would amplify by a factor of @xmath18 in the differentially rotating flow as hot gas approaches the edge of the cooling disk .",
    "we speculated that the corresponding increase in magnetic forces , by @xmath19 , might be sufficient to limit the maximum compression and x - ray visibility of the hot torus just beyond the edge of the cooling disk .",
    "if interstellar magnetic fields are sufficiently large , the x - ray images of rotating ellipticals may appear to be more circular than those predicted by brighenti & mathews ( 1966 ) .",
    "this type of magnetic influence on the x - ray image may be necessary to account for the apparent circularity of _ einstein _ and rosat images of several bright ellipticals in the virgo cluster .",
    "alternatively , the less flattened x - ray appearance of these galaxies could simply result from a fortuitous orientation of galactic rotation axes along the line of sight . in any case , the growth and evolution of magnetic fields in spherical , non - rotating galaxies which we discuss here is a necessary first step toward a more complete study of field amplification and x - ray morphology in slowly rotating ellipticals .",
    "our approach to field amplification is similar to that of moss and shukurov ( 1996 ) who describe the growth of magnetic fields in the turbulent interstellar environment energized by supernova explosions and the orbital energy of stellar ejecta .",
    "we extend the discussion of moss and shukurov to consider how the field is further increased ( i ) by compression as the cooling flow approaches the galactic core and ( ii ) by the greater interstellar turbulence expected in past times when the stellar mass loss and supernova rates were both larger .",
    "our calculation is necessarily approximate since many theoretical aspects of the turbulent dynamo process and field reconnection are based on dimensional arguments .",
    "our models are exploratory , not definitive .",
    "we begin with a brief review of magnetic fields observed in elliptical galaxies then proceed to the description of our time - dependent models and the resulting magnetic field distributions .",
    "the common signposts for the presence of magnetic fields in spiral galaxies  polarization of aligned dust grains , polarized emission from relativistic electrons and zeeman splitting  are not available in ellipticals due in part to the relative absence of dust ( tsai & mathews 1996a ; b ) , the infrequency of supernova explosions and the absence of distributed cold hi gas . by far",
    "the best means of detecting fields in ellipticals is through the differential faraday depolarization of radio sources by fields within the hot , x - ray emitting cooling flow gas which lies along the line of sight . in",
    "most fr ii - type double radio sources the jet that powers the radio lobes is visible at radio frequencies on only one side",
    ". laing ( 1988 ) first noted that the radio polarization was systematically higher on the jet - side which is also the near side , assuming that radiation from the jet is made more visible by relativistic doppler beaming . if near and far lobes are otherwise identical , the depolarization of the more distant lobe must arise in the galactic ism , not within the lobes or in a shell of gas adjacent to the radio lobe .",
    "the body of evidence supporting this correlation has grown considerably , both for lobes in large ellipticals and in small clusters of galaxies ( garrington et al .",
    "1988 ; garrington , conway , & leahy 1991 ; garrington & conway 1991 ) . the depolarization asymmetry is particularly strong for projected lobe separations of galactic dimension , @xmath20 kpc . by comparing the relative faraday depolarization of two lobes it is possible to determine the mean product of the electron density and net line of sight field strength to the center of the galaxy .",
    "a typical value is @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath6 g , implying @xmath23 @xmath6 g for plasma densities characteristic of the hot interstellar gas .",
    "these values are based on models in which the magnetic field is uniform in many small cells which are randomly oriented along the line of sight through the hot ism ( burn 1966 ) .",
    "randomly directed fields are also implied by the patterns of differential radiofrequency faraday rotation observed at high spatial resolution across the face of extended radio lobes or regions ( e.g. strom & jgers 1988 ; owen , eilek , & keel , 1990 ; clarke , burns , & norman 1992 ) .",
    "magnetic fields even larger than those indicated above may be present if they are tangled on spatial scales much less than the radio resolution limit . finally , greenfield , roberts , & burke ( 1985 ) observed differential radio polarization in two gravitationally - lensed images of a distant quasar which they attribute to magnetic fields in the hot ism of the intervening cd galaxy lens .",
    "we conclude that the hot gas in elliptical galaxies that participates in galactic scale cooling flows contains magnetic fields that are comparable to those in spirals and that a significant component of this field is spatially disordered .",
    "the equations that describe the evolution of hydromagnetic cooling flows in elliptical galaxies are the usual conservation equations modified with appropriate source terms : @xmath24 @xmath25 = -{\\bf \\nabla}p   + { 1 \\over 4 \\pi } ( { \\bf \\nabla \\times b}){\\bf \\times b } - \\rho { \\bf \\nabla } \\phi - \\alpha \\rho _ * ( { \\bf v } - { \\bf v}_*),\\eqno(3.2)\\ ] ] and @xmath26 = { p \\over \\rho } \\left [ { \\partial \\rho   \\over \\partial t } + ( { \\bf v } \\cdot { \\bf \\nabla } ) \\rho \\right ] - { \\rho^2 f l(t ) \\over m_p^2}\\ ] ] @xmath27 the galactic potential @xmath28 is appropriate for a stellar density distribution @xmath29 and a dark matter halo . except for the magnetic force term in the equation of motion ( 3.2 ) and heating due to reconnection of magnetic fields , the last term in equation ( 3.3 ) ,",
    "these equations are identical to those used by brighenti and mathews ( 1996 ) .    in the absence of plasma resistivity and field sources ,",
    "the magnetic field evolves according to the usual frozen - in condition : @xmath30 however , for applications to the interstellar medium of elliptical galaxies , it is necessary to include source terms due to fields ejected by evolving stars , turbulent growth , and the loss of field due to reconnection .",
    "these modifications will be developed in the following sections .",
    "although the non - magnetic source terms in equations ( 3.1 ) - ( 3.3 ) have been described in detail by brighenti and mathews ( 1996 ) , for completeness we shall briefly review them again here .",
    "new gas is introduced into the interstellar medium by mass ejection from normally evolving stars formed in a single burst at time @xmath31 .",

    "we shall assume a power law time dependence of the form @xmath51 where @xmath50 is in units of the solar value @xmath52 ergs s@xmath16 and the reduced hubble constant is assumed to be @xmath53 .",
    "the snu parameter defined by equation ( 3.7 ) can not be compared directly with observed values since other uncertain parameters ( such as @xmath54 ) also appear in this same equation .",
    "recent calculations of spherical cooling flows ( mathews 1997 ) have shown that global thermal instabilities or `` galactic drips '' can occur in isolated ellipticals if the supernova rate parameter snu @xmath55 .",

    "the ( source - free ) equation of continuity has a similar form : @xmath73 dividing equations ( 4.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) by ( 4.3 ) , we find @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 therefore each component of the field evolves with the local gas density as a power law having an exponent that depends on the structure the local velocity field as characterized by the exponent @xmath77",

    "will develop radial fields having large scale coherence as the flow approaches the galactic core .",
    "differential shear in slowly rotating ellipticals is expected to convert disordered fields into coherently toroidal configurations ( brighenti & mathews 1996 ) . in either case , however , reconnection may be expected to occur in regions of random field ; when such disordered fields are stretched by the global flow , reconnection could still be important since field lines in adjacent flux tubes will tend to be antiparallel .",

    "whenever @xmath96 is less than the equipartion field @xmath97 and @xmath98 we expect that the field geometry will be continuously randomized by local turbulence ; should @xmath99 the field will be stretched with the fluid and develop large scale coherence .",

    "the validity of this assumption can be estimated by evaluating @xmath108 from the computed cooling flow solutions .",
    "while the flux - freezing condition ( 4.8 ) describes the evolution of a completely disordered field , additional source and sink terms must be included to account for the origin , turbulent growth and loss of the field : @xmath109    the second term on the right represents the growth of the field due to turbulent amplification ; the unit step function [ @xmath110 @xmath111 ; @xmath112 @xmath113 ensures turbulent growth only when @xmath114 .",
    "this term deals in a schematic fashion with a subject of considerable complexity .",
    "normally the turbulent growth of the field would be represented using the ( linear ) mean field dynamo equation ( see beck et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) , however in view of the difficulties described earlier in generating equipartition with the mean field equation , we prefer the simplified approach in equation ( 4.9 ) . the third term on the right accounts for the loss of field by reconnection .",
    "the last two terms on the right represent original seed fields from stellar mass loss and galactic events at time @xmath115 which create non - stellar turbulence in the interstellar gas .",
    "these terms are discussed in more detail in the following .      aside from the possibility of primordial fields which are very small in any case ( beck et al .",
    "1996 ) the most credible source of magnetic field in the interstellar medium are the fields created by dynamos in stellar interiors which are expelled into the ism when red giant stars lose their envelopes .",

    "guided by the magnetic flux observed in white dwarfs , moss and shukurov ( 1996 ) adopted @xmath117 in cgs units as a typical value , corresponding to @xmath118 g and @xmath119 gm @xmath22 ; we adopt this same value here .",
    "after the stellar envelope has expanded to the local density of interstellar gas @xmath120 conserving magnetic flux , the seed field will be very small : @xmath121 g.    an additional source of seed fields may arise from strong turbulent mixing following a significant merger of another galaxy with the elliptical at time @xmath115 or after some other global environmental disturbance .",
    "following such an event , we assume that the entire ism becomes strongly turbulent , amplifying any seed fields until the magnetic energy density is some fraction @xmath122 of the thermal energy density in the gas .",
    "such a hypothetical turbulent event is represented schematically in equation ( 4.9 ) by a magnetic energy density proportional to the local gas pressure , @xmath123 imposed suddenly at time @xmath115 .      the growth of magnetic flux by plasma turbulence in the interstellar medium of elliptical galaxies has been discussed in detail by moss and shukurov ( 1996 ) ; we shall adopt many of their suggestions here .",
    "the two principal internal sources of interstellar turbulence are the mixing of gas ejected from orbiting stars and the creation and buoyant evolution of ( type ia ) supernova remnants ( mathews 1990 ) .",
    "we assume that the random vortical motion associated with these sources amplifies the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "the energy density in the field is expected to grow until it becomes comparable with that in the turbulence and then saturates at that value .",
    "the equipartition field is defined by @xmath124 the turbulent energy density is written as a fraction @xmath125 of the local thermal energy density ( @xmath126 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath95 is an rms speed characterizing local turbulent motion ) .",
    "normally , we expect @xmath127 and therefore @xmath128 .",
    "ideally , a separate dynamical equation should be introduced to describe the creation , transfer and evolution of turbulent energy density .",
    "however , we avoid these complications here by assuming that the turbulent energy density is generally small ( @xmath129 ) and that the principal catalytic role of turbulent energy is to convert sources of interstellar energy into magnetic energy density .",
    "in addition we shall assume for simplicity that the turbulence generated by stellar ejecta and supernovae is homogeneous and isotropic ; this ( somewhat optimistic ) assumption is discussed by moss and shukurov ( 1996 ) .",
    "the turbulent field is produced by a superposition of kinetic energy created by stellar ejecta and supernova remnants .",
    "the stellar contribution to the local turbulent energy density is given by the product of the rate of energy production by mass ejection from evolving ( red giant ) stars @xmath130 ( ergs @xmath22 s@xmath16 ) , the fraction @xmath131 of this energy that goes into turbulence , and the characteristic eddy turnover time @xmath132 : @xmath133 the characteristic rms turbulent velocity is @xmath134 although the full range of turbulent velocities must extend up to the local stellar velocities .. the typical eddy size @xmath135 should be comparable to the dimension of a stellar envelope ( or planetary nebula ) after it has expanded to pressure equilibrium ( at @xmath136k ) with the local interstellar gas .",
    "for this purpose ( following moss & shukurov 1996 ) we use the estimate of this length scale determined by mathews ( 1990 ) , @xmath137 cm , where @xmath79 is the local interstellar density .",
    "we assume that the turbulent mixing time is the eddy turnover time of the largest eddies , @xmath138 ; this is conservative since the turnover rate is faster for smaller eddies .",
    "equation ( 4.11 ) can be solved at each galactic radius for the stellar equipartition parameter @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",

    "the turnover time for the largest eddies is @xmath150 years .    in a similar manner type ia supernovae feed energy into the interstellar medium at a rate @xmath151 ( ergs @xmath22 cm@xmath16 ) and a fraction @xmath131 of this is assumed to go into turbulent motions .",
    "the eddy mixing time is @xmath153 where @xmath154 . for supernova - driven turbulence",
    "the ( largest ) eddy dimensions are comparable to the size of the hot bubble formed in the interstellar medium following each supernova event , @xmath155 cm , based on the blast wave calculations of mathews ( 1990 ) .",
    "combining these expressions , the equipartition parameter for supernova induced turbulence is @xmath156 for the bright elliptical shown in table 1 we find @xmath157 ( valid for @xmath142 ) , which is somewhat larger than the stellar contribution to turbulence for a given @xmath131 .",

    "the combined turbulent mixing time required in equation ( 4.9 ) is found from @xmath160 and the total equipartition field is given by equation ( 4.10 ) with @xmath161 .",
    "obviously the introduction of turbulent energy by supernovae occurs at the location of these events , not in a spatially smooth manner as represented by the turbulent source term in equation ( 4.9 ) .",
    "nevertheless we shall assume that the turbulence is driven in a smooth , homogeneous manner .",
    "the applicability of this assumption is discussed by moss & shukurov ( 1996 ) .",
    "in addition to using stellar processes to produce vortical turbulence , moss and shukurov ( 1996 ) also invoke `` acoustic turbulence , '' a general field of compressional ( sound ) waves or noise associated with stellar mass loss and ( particularly ) supernova explosions . although the coupling of this acoustical energy density to the usual vortical turbulence is non - linear and inefficient , moss and shukurov claim that acoustical wave energy contributes substantially to the turbulent growth of the magnetic field and that these waves ultimately steepen into shocks .",

    "compression waves should damp before they steepen into shocks .",
    "for example , damping due to plasma viscosity @xmath6 exponentially reduces the flux of plane parallel sound waves of frequency @xmath162 propagating in the x - direction by @xmath163 , where @xmath164 ( e.g. zeldovich and raizer 1966 ) .",
    "damping by thermal conductivity @xmath165 is comparable .",

    "we do not consider turbulent field generation by the acoustical wave field here .      the expected dominance of random magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies implies that the occurrence of counter - directed nearby fields should be common .",

    "we shall follow the simple representation used by these authors for the field reconnection time scale in equation ( 4.9 ) : @xmath168 here @xmath169 is a single parameter that describes the reconnection efficiency .",
    "in addition we shall assume with these authors that all of the field energy lost by reconnection is entirely converted to thermal energy ; so a term @xmath170 must appear in the thermal energy equation ( 3.3 ) .",

    "our cooling flow solutions are not sensitive to the value of the seed field parameter @xmath186 since for all cases considered the exponential growth of field in the turbulent dynamo is rapid compared to the local gas flow time ( @xmath187 ) in the ism .",
    "the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath115 ( see eqn . 4.19 ) can be used to simulate the global turbulence expected following a galactic merger or some other short - lived source of turbulence . each calculation",

    "_ 1990 ; 1991 ) .",
    "interstellar turbulence is turned on at a later time ( @xmath189 gyr ) to avoid numerical interference that may occur if the gas and the magnetic field are initiated at the same time .",
    "the calculations are stopped at 15 gyr which we regard as the present time .",
    "our elliptical galaxy is assumed to be perfectly isolated apart from the environmental influences represented by the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath115 .    in figure 1",
    "we compare several cooling flow models at time @xmath146 gyr .",
    "the non - magnetic flow shown in figure 1a - c resembles spherical cooling flows that have been discussed in detail elsewhere ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1996 ; mathews 1997 ) .",
    "the parameters used for this non - magnetic cooling flow are : @xmath190 and snu @xmath191 .",
    "some numerical irregularity is visible in figures 1a and 1b for @xmath192 because of the smaller number of computational zones in the galactic core .",
    "most of this numerical noise arises when central zones are removed as they cool below @xmath193 k. we recognize that the x - ray surface brightness @xmath194 corresponding to our model in figure 1a - c decreases somewhat more steeply with galactic radius than that typically observed ( trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares 1986 ) .",
    "the traditional correction for this discrepancy has been to remove gas from the flow , assuming that stars or some other invisible objects are formed from the mass that `` drops out '' ( e.g. stewart et al .",
    "1987 ; white & sarazin 1987 ; thomas et al .",
    "our models would adjust in a similar manner if mass were removed .",
    "we have not included drop out in our calculations for several reasons : ( i ) we wish to illustrate the possible dynamic influence of magnetic forces without additional uncertain complications , ( ii ) in those ( perhaps unlikely ) situations when the magnetic field is strong , its influence on the solution ( and @xmath194 ) is very similar to mass drop - out , and ( iii ) thermal instabilities , often invoked to justify mass drop out , are generally arrested at a very early stage in the presence of modest magnetic fields .",
    "the corresponding case i magnetic cooling flow evolution with parameters @xmath195 snu @xmath191 , @xmath196 cm , and @xmath197 is illustrated by the solid lines in figure 1d - f .",
    "our choice of a large @xmath169 effectively shuts down the reconnection process , maximizing the computed field strength .",
    "even though half of the energy from stellar sources is available to drive the turbulent dynamo , the gas density , temperature and pressure are all essentially unchanged from the field - free cooling flow ( figure 1a - c ) .",
    "the magnetic pressure @xmath8 ( long dashed line in fig .",
    "1f ) is never more than a few percent of the gas pressure although it is somewhat larger at small galactic radii .",
    "but the field strength indicated in figure 1f ( long - dashed curve ) is not small , reaching 1 @xmath6 g at @xmath198 kpc and 10 @xmath6 g at 1 kpc .",
    "of course these fields are upper limits because we assume that the dynamo is efficient and our choice of large @xmath169 effectively deactivates field reconnection .",
    "we find that the results in figure 1f are essentially unchanged as long as @xmath199 cm . the magnetic field throughout the galaxy slowly decreases with @xmath169 ;",
    "in figure 1f we show that the field is reduced only by a factor of @xmath200 ( short - dashed line ) when @xmath201 cm .",
    "unfortunately the physical significance of this is unlear . the reconnection process ,",
    "if it is important , is expected to occur throughout the flow in very thin boundary layers separating regions of adjacent antiparallel fields .",
    "such a physically complex process can not be adequately modeled with the single parameter @xmath169 .",
    "also illustrated in figure 1f ( dotted line ) is the magnetic pressure at @xmath146 gyr that results when @xmath131 is increased to @xmath202 with the other parameters unchanged ( snu @xmath191 , @xmath196 cm , and @xmath197 ) .",
    "the field is slightly larger in this case because of the somewhat greater turbulent energy that existed early in the cooling flow evolution .",
    "we have also computed cooling flow solutions with the same parameters but using the case ii equations .",
    "we find that the results are essentially identical to those of the case i solutions .",
    "as explained below , the insensitivity to the specific representation ( equation 4.20a or b ) for the turbulent growth of the field arises because for either case the field grows to equipartition early in the calculation in a time short compared to the local flow time ( @xmath187 ) .    of particular interest for understanding the amplification of disordered fields in galactic cooling flows",
    "are the radial dependences of the thermal , magnetic and turbulent energy densities .",
    "using the approximate power law variations discussed in  4.3.2 , the thermal energy density should vary as @xmath203 .",
    "for turbulence driven by either stars or type ia supernovae , the turbulent energy density varies as @xmath204 and the equipartition field must vary in the same manner , @xmath205 .",
    "however , the field compression that accompanies the cooling flow causes a slightly steeper variation , @xmath206 .",
    "two important conclusions follow from these spatial dependencies : ( 1 ) the increase in the magnetic field strength toward the galactic center can be dominated by compression in the cooling flow , not local turbulence , and , if so , ( 2 ) the magnitude of the interstellar field depends entirely on the most distant radius in the galactic ism where the turbulent dynamo process amplified stellar seed fields at some previous time .    in figure 2a",
    "we plot the spatial variation of the thermal , magnetic and turbulent energy densities for the standard magnetic cooling flow solution ( shown in figure 1d - f with solid lines ) at times @xmath207 and @xmath208 gyr ; these contours are essentially identical for case i and case ii equations .",
    "the slopes of the various energy densities ( in the linear parts of the log - log contours ) are in excellent agreement with the approximate variations estimated above . at either 12 or 15",
    "gyrs @xmath209 is almost 10 times larger than @xmath210 throughout most of the galactic volume .",
    "as expected from the previous estimate , the local turbulent energy density plays no explicit role in field amplification since @xmath211 .",
    "this excess of the field above the local equipartition value occurs because the field at @xmath146 gyr is a relic of a historical field which developed when the turbulence was larger . at an early time in the evolution of this cooling flow equipartition ( @xmath212 )",
    "was reached in time @xmath213 throughout the galaxy , but as the calculation proceeded the turbulent energy decreased ( @xmath214 as expected from the scaling relations in  4.3.2 when @xmath215 ) .",
    "the super - equipartition field is maintained and amplified by compression in the cooling flow .",
    "since @xmath216 increases with radius , the current galactic field is most sensitive to past turbulent conditions in the outermost parts of the galactic flow .    in this regard",
    "we note the small decrease in @xmath209 in figure 2a that occurs near the outer boundary @xmath217 of the galaxy between 12 and 15 gyrs . in this part of the flow the gas density drops slightly during this time interval due to",
    "the ( losing ) competition between the decreasing rate that gas is introduced by evolving stars and the depletion of gas by global inflow toward the galactic core .",
    "as @xmath79 decreases , the magnetic field must also decrease ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "some additional loss of local field near @xmath217 may occur because the local field is being diluted by new gas that only contains the very small seed field yet turbulent amplification is not possible until @xmath96 drops below the equipartition value .",
    "figure 2b shows how the frozen - in field has been advected inward toward the galactic center , creating and maintaining the expected slope @xmath218 throughout the interstellar medium .",
    "this also illustrates how the field throughout the x - ray bright central parts of the ism depends critically on the historical turbulent growth in very distant regions . in view of the relationship between the global field and past turbulence near the outer edge of the galaxy",
    ", it might be thought that the growth of the field would be sensitive to the outer boundary conditions in the flow , but this is not the case .",
    "for example we repeated the standard calculation shown in figure 1d - f ( solid lines ) with an open boundary condition at @xmath219 which allows gas to flow out beyond the galaxy into the surrounding vacuum .",
    "after @xmath146 gyrs the flow variables and the field strength distribution within the galaxy were essentially identical to those shown in figure 1d - f .",
    "evidently the gas density and pressure near @xmath220 is maintained by local stellar mass loss , not by the small amount of gas that flows out of the galaxy when an open boundary is allowed .",
    "finally , we have performed some calculations with non - zero @xmath122 to simulate an event , such as a galactic merger , that introduces global turbulence throughout the ism at some time @xmath115 in the past . in figure 1g - i",
    "we illustrate the magnetic cooling flow at time @xmath146 gyr following a disturbance in the the interstellar gas that occurred at @xmath221 gyr when the turbulent energy density was raised to one fourth of the thermal energy density ( @xmath222 ) throughout the galaxy . as a result of this event , the magnetic energy density at 15 gyr ( fig .",
    "1i ) is @xmath223 times larger than it would have been otherwise ( fig .",
    "this illustrates that present day magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies can be significantly increased by past events that stirred up the outer parts of the interstellar gas and which expended energies that are small compared to the total binding energy of the interstellar gas . for the cooling flow in figure 1g",
    "- i the magnetic energy density @xmath224 is imposed impulsively at time @xmath115 and subsequent growth of @xmath8 is due to compression in the global flow . by time @xmath146 gyr figure 1i shows that magnetic pressure dominates the flow dynamics within about 5 kpc of the galactic center while the gas density remains monotonic , implying that the magnetic core does not become buoyant .",
    "however , the magnetic stresses are sufficient to slow down the local flow in @xmath225 kpc allowing an accumulation of gas near this radius where some radiative cooling and mass deposition occurs .",
    "this is reminisent of the `` galactic drip '' phenomenon in which gas in non - magnetic cooling flows can cool far from the galactic center ( mathews 1997 ) , but the increase in gas density and thermal instability shown in figure 1i has a purely magnetic origin .",
    "when @xmath122 is lowered to 0.15 , @xmath226 occurs at a smaller radius , @xmath227 kpc , and radiative cooling beyond the galactic core no longer occurs .",
    "some caution must be exercised in interpreting the non - stellar turbulent growth imposed at @xmath115 in terms of a galactic merger . for galactic mergers",
    "in which the galactic mass is increased by a relatively small factor , @xmath228 percent , mathews and brighenti ( 1997 ) have shown that enough energy can be released by type ii supernovae from newly created stars to remove most or all of the preexisting galactic interstellar gas .",
    "such an energy release obviously depends on the assumed initial mass function for the newly formed stars .",
    "we do not consider these complications here .",
    "in this study of the evolution of interstellar magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies we have shown that the observed fields can be understood as a natural result of internal evolutionary processes : stellar seed fields are first amplified by a turbulent dynamo then by compression in the galactic cooling flow .",
    "we have assumed that stellar dynamos occur in virtually all stars and that these stars supply tiny seed fields to the ism as they undergo mass loss during normal red giant evolution .",
    "our optimism concerning the efficacy of the turbulent dynamo mechanism and the relative inefficacy of field reconnection have been essential in obtaining central field strengths comparable to those observed , @xmath229 @xmath6 g .",
    "our models extend a modified version of the turbulent dynamo theory proposed by moss and shukurov ( 1996 ) to include the important effects of compressional field amplification in the global galactic cooling flow and the evolutionary relationship between currently observed fields and those created by galactic turbulence many gyrs ago . as the field advects from the outer regions of the galaxy to the galactic core",
    "the field compresses by @xmath230 and the magnetic energy density increases by @xmath231 . in our models",
    "the magnetic energy density exceeds the local turbulent energy density ( @xmath211 ) throughout most of the interstellar gas so local turbulence plays little or no role in field amplification .",
    "when @xmath211 the field may quench some of the turbulent activity although we have not allowed for this feedback in our models ; it is also unclear whether the random character of the field ( on scales of @xmath135 or @xmath232 ) can be fully maintained in this limit . for most of the magnetic cooling",
    "flows described here we have assumed that half of the stellar energy goes ( at least initially ) into turbulence ( @xmath195 ) . although the ratio @xmath131 of turbulent energy to immediately thermalized energy resulting from stellar mass loss processes is uncertain , our results suggest that the resulting field strength does not depend strongly on @xmath131 .",
    "how sensitive are our results , particularly the condition @xmath211 , to the specific galaxy model we have adopted , a simple king stellar distribution with an isothermal dark halo ? to address this question it is useful to express the radial variation of the magnetic and turbulent energy densities in terms of the gas and stellar densities . for either stellar or supernova turbulence",
    "we find @xmath233 and @xmath234",
    ". therefore the ratio of these energy densities @xmath235 .",
    "clearly the radial variation of the gas density depends on both the stellar and dark matter density profiles , so the interpretation of this last relation is complex . to make further progress ,",
    "suppose that we adopt the point of view that the x - ray and optical surface brightness profiles are the same , i.e. @xmath236 .",
    "canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri ( 1987 ) found this to be the case for three bright ellipticals in virgo , but more recent rosat observations show some deviations from exact proportionality .",
    "however , if @xmath236 then @xmath237 and @xmath238 so that @xmath209 _ increases _ very slowly relative to @xmath210 with increasing galactic radius , opposite to the variation shown in figure 2a .",
    "we may expect , therefore , that the ratio @xmath239 could either slowly increase or decrease with galactic radius , depending on the details of the galactic model .",
    "however , regardless of these details it is clear that the interstellar magnetic field can increase toward the galactic center _ no slower _ than @xmath107 as shown in figure 2b .",
    "finally we note that in our models the @xmath239 increases with the cooling inflow most strongly in the outermost parts of the galaxy where the power law scaling breaks down and where the observational uncertainty is greatest .",
    "if interstellar fields in elliptical galaxies have their origins in the seed fields of stellar ejecta , the physical scale @xmath240 of regions of faraday coherence may be smaller than previously supposed ( burn 1966 ; garrington & conway 1991 ) .",
    "regions in the hot interstellar gas having masses comparable to those of stellar envelopes , @xmath241 @xmath242 , have diameters of only @xmath243 pc .",
    "however , faraday - coherent regions of parallel field lines will be even smaller because of the violent instabilities that accompany stellar mass loss .",
    "since the observed faraday depolarization parameter is proportional to @xmath244 , the field implied by any observation will be larger as @xmath240 is reduced .",
    "this difficulty is not alleviated by large scale fields that can develop in ( non - hubble ) spherical or differentially rotating non - spherical cooling flows , since such an `` aligned '' field will still be counter - directed on small mass scales .",
    "the scale of field coherence @xmath240 can increase if reconnection is efficient , but this would also decrease the overall magnetic energy density . clearly ,",
    "more attention must be given to the likelihood of field reconnection in cooling flow environments .",
    "\\(1 ) self - generated interstellar magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies can be comparable to those suggested in faraday depolarization studies provided ( i ) the turbulent dynamo process can amplify the mean field to equipartition with the turbulent energy density and ( ii ) field reconnection is not dominant throughout most of the ism .",
    "\\(2 ) using our galactic model , a significant additional amplification of the overall field occurs by compression in the galactic cooling flow ; the magnetic energy density is increased by factors of @xmath231 .",
    "\\(4 ) the exact value of the field in ellipticals is sensitive to interstellar turbulence at large distances from the galactic center and at distant times in the past . for this reason we may expect some variability in field strengths among elliptical galaxies , depending on the environmental history of the outer galaxy .",
    "\\(5 ) in our spherical cooling flow models the magnetic energy density or pressure in self - generated cooling flows ( @xmath197 ) never dominates the galactic gas pressure ( nor becomes buoyant ) so we do not expect the x - ray images to be strongly influenced by the field . in more realistic rotating cooling flows ,",
    "however , the magnetic pressure resulting from differential rotation may decrease the x - ray brightness near the cooling flow disk ( brighenti & mathews 1996 ) .",

    "<S> the magnitude of the interstellar field depends on the most distant radius in the galactic ism at which the turbulent dynamo process can successfully have amplified stellar seed fields . because of the long hydrodynamic flow times in galactic cooling flows , currently observed magnetic fields may result from periods of turbulent field amplification that occurred in the outer galaxy in the distant past . in our most optimistic turbulent dynamo models in which field reconnection </S>",

    "<S> however , the sensitivity of the galactic magnetic field to poorly known historical turbulent conditions in the outer galaxy complicates estimates of field strengths that can be produced internally . </S>",
