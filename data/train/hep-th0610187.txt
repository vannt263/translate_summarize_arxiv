    "the essential ingredient in 2t - physics is the basic gauge symmetry sp@xmath1 acting on phase space @xmath2 @xcite . under this gauge symmetry , momentum and position are locally indistinguishable , so the symmetry leads to some deep consequences @xcite - @xcite .",
    "one of the strikingly surprising aspects of 2t - physics is that a given @xmath3 dimensional 2 t theory descends , through sp@xmath0 gauge fixing , down to a family of holographic 1 t images in ( d-1)+1 dimensions , all of which are gauge equivalent to the parent 2 t theory and to each other .",
    "however , from the point of view of 1t - physics each image appears as a different dynamical system with a different hamiltonian .",
    "some of the phenomena that emerge in 2t - physics include certain types of dualities , holography and emergent spacetimes , which have been studied primarily at the level of classical and quantum particle dynamics ( fig.1 ) .",
    "+ fig.1 - some 1t - physics systems that emerge from the solutions of q@xmath4    hence , 2t - physics is a unification approach for 1t - physics systems through higher dimensions .",
    "it is distinctly different than kaluza - klein theory because there are no kaluza - klein towers of states , but instead there is a family of 1 t systems with duality type relationships among them .    in the field",
    "theoretic 4 + 2 sm the type of phenomena summarized in fig.1 are expected . for the time being only one of the field theoretic images , namely the one labeled as massless relativistic particle  in fig.1 , has been studied .",
    "it is this 3 + 1 holographic image of the 4 + 2 sm that coincides with the well known 3 + 1 sm .",
    "this emergent sm has some attractive features : it solves the long standing cp problem , and leads to novel ideas on the origins of mass generation , as mentioned in the abstract .",
    "i now describe the main features of the 2t - physics field theory and its consequences in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "the generic field theory with fields of spins @xmath6 and @xmath7 includes a set of so@xmath8 vectors @xmath9 labeled with @xmath10 so@xmath8 vector , and @xmath11 the adjoint representation of some yang - mills gauge group @xmath12 scalars @xmath13 labeled by an internal symmetry index @xmath14 ( a collection of irreducible representations of @xmath15 ) ; left or right handed spinors @xmath16 in the @xmath17 representations of su@xmath18so@xmath19 labeled with @xmath20 and @xmath21 and internal symmetry indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( again , a collection of irreducible representations of @xmath15 ) .",
    "the generic lagrangian has the form of a yang - mills theory in @xmath5 dimensions ( @xmath15-covariant derivatives ) , except for space - time features shown explicitly in the lagrangian below , needed to impose the underlying sp@xmath24 gauge symmetry and the related 2t - physics gauge symmetries .",
    "there is no space here to give the details of the 2t - physics gauge symmetries in field theory @xcite , but i note the basic important fact that the equations of motion that follow from the lagrangian below impose the sp@xmath0 gauge singlet conditions @xmath25 indicated in fig.1 , but now including interactions @xcite @xmath26the distinctive space - time features in 4 + 2 dimensions include the delta function @xmath27 and its derivative @xmath28 that impose @xmath29 the kinetic terms of fermions that include the factors @xmath30 and yukawa couplings that include the factors @xmath31 or @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 etc . , with @xmath35 gamma matrices @xmath36 in the @xmath37,@xmath38 spinor bases of su@xmath39=so@xmath40 this lagrangian is not invariant under translation of @xmath41 but is invariant under the spacetime rotations so@xmath40    this lagrangian has precisely the right space - time , and gauge invariance , properties for the @xmath5 field theory to yield the usual @xmath42 field theory via gauge fixing , with the usual kinetic terms and yukawa couplings in the emergent @xmath42 dimensional minkowski space @xmath43 .",
    "the emergent @xmath42 theory contains just the right fields as functions of @xmath43 : all extra degrees of freedom disappear without leaving behind any kaluza - klein type modes or extra components of the vector and spinor fields in the extra 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the emergent @xmath42 field theory is invariant under translations and lorentz transformations so@xmath44 : these poincar symmetries are included in so@xmath8 that takes the non - linear form of conformal transformations in the emergent @xmath42 dimensional space - time @xmath45 , as indicated in fig.1 .    as in the last line of the lagrangian",
    ", one may also include an additional so@xmath46 scalar , the dilaton @xmath47 classified as a singlet under the group @xmath48 the dilaton is not optional if the action is written in @xmath3 dimensions ( see @xcite ) , as it appears in overall factors @xmath49 multiplying the yang - mills kinetic term and yukawa terms respectively , in order to achieve the 2t - gauge symmetry of the action . in @xmath50 dimensions ( @xmath51 )",
    "these factors reduce to @xmath52 but the dilaton can still couple to the scalars @xmath53 in the potential @xmath54    while almost all of the usual terms of @xmath42 dimensional yang - mills theory coupled to matter appear in the @xmath42 theory that emerges from the @xmath5 field theory above , there are two notable exceptions that play an important and interesting physical role when we apply the @xmath5 approach to construct the standard model .",
    "namely ,    * the 2t - gauge symmetry requires the potential @xmath55 to be purely quartic , i.e. no mass terms are permitted .",
    "then the emergent 3 + 1 theory can not have mass terms for the scalars , and is automatically invariant under scale transformations .",
    "* there is no way to generate a term in the emergent @xmath42 theory that is analogous to the p and cp - violating @xmath56 term that is possible in @xmath42 dimensions .",
    "its absence theory should not include terms that descend to non - normalizable interactions in @xmath57 actually there appears as if there would be a topological term of the form @xmath58 whose density is a total divergence for any yang - mills gauge group @xmath59 and therefore should not affect the equations of motion , or renormalizability .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , this term can be gauge fixed to zero by using the 2 t gauge symmetry .",
    "in this sense , the 2 t gauge symmetry plays a similar role to the peccei - quinn symmetry in eliminating the topological term . but one must realize that the 2 t gauge symmetry is introduced for other more fundamental reasons and also it is not a global symmetry .",
    "hence , unlike the peccei - quinn symmetry it does not lead to an axion . ] is due to the fact that the levi - civita symbol in @xmath5 dimensions has 6 indices rather than @xmath60 and also due to the combination of 2 t gauge symmetry as well as yang - mills gauge symmetry .",
    "the absence of this cp - violating term is of crucial importance in the axionless resolution of the strong cp violation problem of qcd suggested in @xcite .",
    "the 2t - physics field theory above is applied to construct the standard model in 4 + 2 dimensions by choosing the gauge group @xmath61su@xmath62su@xmath63u@xmath64 and including the usual matter representations for the higgs , quarks and leptons ( including right handed neutrinos in singlets of @xmath15 ) , but now as fields in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "as explained in @xcite this theory descends to the usual standard model in @xmath42 dimensions .",
    "the emergent @xmath42 theory leads to phenomenological consequences of considerable significance .",
    "in particular , the higher structure in @xmath5 dimensions prevents the problematic @xmath65 term in qcd .",
    "this resolves the strong cp problem without a need for the peccei - quinn symmetry or the corresponding elusive axion .",
    "mass generation with the higgs mechanism is less straightforward since the tachyonic mass term is not allowed .",
    "however by taking the potential of the form @xmath66 we obtain the breaking of the electroweak symmetry by the higgs doublet @xmath67 driven by the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton @xmath68 , thus relating the the two phase transitions to each other . in this way the 4 + 2 formulation of the standard model provides an appealing deeper physical basis for mass .",
    "in addition , there are some brand new mechanisms of mass generation related to the higher dimensions that deserve further study ( e.g. massive particle gauge in fig.1 ) .",
    "the dilaton driven electroweak phase transition makes a lot more sense conceptually than the usual approach in which the electroweak phase transition is an isolated phenomenon .",
    "this is because the higgs vacuum expectation value fills all space everywhere in the universe .",
    "this is a hard concept to swallow without relating it to the evolution of the universe , which then requires the participation of gravity . by having @xmath67 being driven by the dilaton , not only the relation to the behavior of the gravity multiplet",
    "is established , but also a relation is established to other phase transitions , such as the vacuum selection process in string theory ( which depends on the dilaton ) , and perhaps even to inflation that is driven by a scalar field which could be the dilaton .",
    "although unclear at the present for lack of a full understanding of the quantum theory , we may have also found the seeds for a resolution of the hierarchy problem in 2t - physics .",
    "namely , the absence of quadratic terms is a consequence of symmetry at the classical level , and if the symmetry is not anomalous it would lead to the absence of the quadratic divergence at the quantum level , thus resolving the hierarchy problem .",
    "the 4 + 2 formulation requires the kinds of concepts above that are not required and therefore not contemplated in the literature of the usual standard model or its extensions in @xmath42 dimensions .",
    "the presence of the dilaton , as well as the right handed neutrinos , are features with further phenomenological consequences .",
    "both of these are very weakly coupled to standard matter .",
    "hence they are possible candidates for dark matter .",
    "in particular , the dilaton communicates with all other matter only through the higgs .",
    "if a higgs is found at the lhc , it could provide a gateway to measure phenomenological effects of the required dilatonic degree of freedom in the 4 + 2 formulation of the standard model .    in summary ,",
    "i emphasize the following physics points that the new formulation of the standard model implies    * 2t - physics works and is a physical theory ! local sp@xmath1",
    "( i.e. @xmath69 indistinguishable ) is a fundamental principle that agrees with everything we know about nature as embodied by the standard model . *",
    "the standard model in 4 + 2 dimensions provides new guidance to fundamental physics : it resolves the strong cp violation problem of qcd , and leads to the appealing concept of dilaton driven electroweak spontaneous symmetry breakdown .",
    "* a weakly coupled dilaton may have phenomenological signals at the lhc .",
    "it could also be a candidate for dark matter .",
    "since this is a required particle in the 4 + 2 formulation , and since this formulation solves the fundamental cp problem , the dilaton concept and its possible observation at the lhc must be taken seriously . * the 2t - physics concepts are easily applied to physics beyond the standard model , including guts , susy , and gravity .",
    "all of these can be elevated to 2t - physics in d+2 dimensions .",
    "these will be reported in the near future . *",
    "strings and branes have only been partially formulated in 2t - physics . in particular , tensionless strings and branes , and the twistor superstring , have already been obtained . * similarly , it is expected that 2t - physics is a good guide for constructing m - theory in 11 + 2 dimensions with an osp@xmath70 global susy .",
    "* there seems to be practical advantages of formulating 1 t physics from the vantage point of d+2 dimensions .",
    "this is seen by examining the type of phenomena summarized in fig.1 .",
    "namely , 2t - physics provides new insights : emergent spacetimes and dynamics , unification , holography , duality , hidden symmetries , that could be used to analyze theories such as qcd and others in a non - perturbative fashion .",
    "i hope that this aspect of 2t - physics will become an effective tool in the future .",
