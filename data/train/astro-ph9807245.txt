    "clear evidence for supermassive black holes comes from studies of nearby galaxies .",
    "the centres of most of these galaxies display little or no activity , but most seem to harbour massive black holes probably remnants of an earlier quasar phase ( kormendy and richstone 1995 , tremaine 1997 for recent reviews ) .",
    "it is a puzzle why the massive black holes in the nearby galaxies do not show quasar  like activity .",
    "the problem becomes particularly relevant for the case of nearby giant elliptical galaxies where it is implausible to postulate that the black holes are starved of fuel to power the accretion process .",
    "x - ray studies for such giant ellipticals reveal the presence of an extensive hot gas pervading their centres ( as well as the surrounding cluster ) . if there were a huge black hole then some of this gas would inevitably be accreting into it , at a rate which can be estimated from the bondi ( 1952 ) formula ( a lower limit )",
    ". this accretion would give rise to far more activity than is observed if the radiative efficiency were as high as 10 per cent as generally postulated in standard accretion theory ( fabian & canizares 1988 ) .",
    "motivated by this problem fabian & rees ( 1995 ) have recently suggested that the final stages of accretion in such objects occurs through an advection  dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 , abramovicz et al .",
    "1995 ) . within the context of such an accretion mode ,",
    "the quiescence of these nuclei is not surprising . for low accretion rates , the expected luminosity scales as @xmath0 rather than @xmath1 :",
    "when the accretion occurs at a low rate , and the viscosity is high enough to ensure that the gas accretes quickly ( and densities are low ) , the radiative efficiency is low .",
    "the gas inflates into a thick torus where the kinetic temperature of the ions is close to the virial temperature .",
    "only a small fraction of the gravitational energy is radiated ; most is swallowed into the black hole .",
    "the relevance of this accretion solution in ellipticals has been illustrated by its application to the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ( ngc 4486 ) .",
    "this has a quiescent active nucleus the luminosity of which does not exceed @xmath2 with a nuclear black hole mass @xmath3 ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ; harms et al .",
    "1994 , macchetto et al .",
    "the radio and x - ray emission in m87 is fully consistent with accretion at the expected rate only if it involves an adaf ( reynolds et al .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that if elliptical galaxies like m60 ( ngg 4649 , di matteo & fabian 1997 ) or ngc 4472 , ngc 4636 ( mahadevan 1997 ) have advection  dominated nuclei then the upper limit on their nuclear mass black hole can be of the order of @xmath4 , thereby allowing supermassive black holes in these systems .",
    "although accretion of hot gas in an elliptical galaxy may create the ideal circumstances for an adaf to operate , stronger observational evidence needs to be obtained . in this paper",
    "we examine how adaf models of nuclei in ellipticals can be constrained with further high frequency radio and submillimeter data .      in an adaf ,",
    "the majority of the observable emission is in the radio and x  ray bands . in the radio band",
    "the emission results from cyclo  synchrotron emission due to the strong magnetic field in the inner parts of the accretion flow .",
    "the x - ray emission is due either to bremsstrahlung or inverse compton scattering . on the observational side , therefore , the cleanest way of determining the presence of an adaf is to examine the correlation between radio and x - ray emissions .",
    "the spectral predictions of the adaf model are quite precise in these wavebands and the expected correlation tight .",
    "weak central radio sources are observed in the centres of many otherwise quiescent ellipticals ( sadler et al .",
    "if these galaxies all harbour massive black holes , this radio emission could similarly be attributed to the synchrotron radiation in an inefficient accretion mode ( i.e. an adaf ) .    the self ",
    "absorbed synchrotron spectrum in an adaf slowly rises with frequency in the radio band , up to some critical turnover frequency , typically in high radio to sub ",
    "mm frequencies , above which it should abruptly drop . a large spectral break there is crucially indicative of thermal self  absorbed synchrotron emission",
    ". observations of a slowly  rising spectrum which sharply cuts off in the sub - mm band , would provide the cleanest evidence that such an accretion mode is taking place in nearby galaxies .    here , we examine the high - frequency very large array ( vla ) and submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) data for three giant ellipticals in the virgo cluster ngc 4649 , ngc 4636 , and ngc 4472 where the spectral turnover should be seen .",
    "slee et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show that the size of most of the radio cores in elliptical galaxies is on the parsec scale or less which would imply that they are powered by an engine similar to that in more luminous radio galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that these authors find that the cores of ellipticals usually have flat or rising spectra .",
    "the motivation for the choice of these galaxies is two  fold . on one hand , the radio data already existing ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1988 ) for both ngc 4649 and ngc 4636 imply a flat / slowly rising radio spectral component and therefore a tentative agreement with the adaf predictions in the intermediate  frequency radio band .",
    "in particular the radio spectrum of ngc 4649 was shown to closely resemble that expected from the self ",
    "absorbed synchrotron radiation ( di matteo & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "on the other hand , as discussed above , these giant elliptical galaxies seem to be the strongest candidates for illustrating the possibility of explaining quiescent accretion via adafs .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) have now provided high resolution dynamical models for these and many other nearby galaxies and a determination of nuclear black hole masses of the order of @xmath5 ( see table  [ t : bh ] ) .",
    ".black hole masses ( magorrian et al . 1998 ) and predicted luminosities [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]             a small amount of very dense matter in the central region of an adaf have an important effect on the emitted spectrum ( celotti , fabian & rees 1992 ) . in particular , if a small fraction of the total amount of matter is in the form of small dense clouds much of the primary synchrotron radiation emitted by an adaf would be absorbed . as examined by ferland & rees ( 1988 ) the radiative equilibrium of very dense gas irradiated by an intense source",
    "is dominated by free  free absorption which is extremely effective at depleting the low frequency radiation from the primary source ( in this case the adaf ) .",
    "the absorbed primary radiation is re  emitted as quasi ",
    "blackbody radiation at the equilibrium temperature .",
    "in other words , the magnetic field in an adaf could be as high as in equipartition but the synchrotron emission suppressed . as discussed by rees ( 1987 ) the relatively strong magnetic field in the flow , responsible for the production of the synchrotron radiation , can also provide the means of cloud confinement .",
    "the theoretically simplest possibility is that the gas is confined to small regions from which the magnetic field is excluded .",
    "the condition of pressure equilibrium ( i.e. cloud thermal pressure balancing the compressive magnetic stresses ) then imposes a maximum density @xmath6 where a reference value of @xmath7 has been assumed for the temperature of the gas in the clouds and @xmath8 g is the magnetic field in the vicinity of the hole from eqn . ( 2 ) with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( see also celotti & rees 1998 for more details )",
    ". with such density and temperature and absorption extending up to frequency @xmath12 hz the thickness of the absorbing region can be as small as @xmath13",
    ". a small volume filling factor can still be consistent with a large covering fraction if the clouds are very numerous , or if their thickness is much smaller then their length , i.e. filaments .    in our adaf model , the synchrotron radiation at different frequencies",
    "is produced at different radii in the flow , the emission at @xmath14 hz ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ 4649spec ] and fig .",
    "[ 4472_4636specs ] ) coming from close to the black hole and the emission from lower frequencies coming from further out .",
    "it is plausible that the free  free absorption can be large enough to deplete most of the high energy emission within a certain radius .",
    "( if the clouds are sheared as they are accreted inward , their column density could go down .",
    "but because @xmath15 increases in the higher pressure regions free  free opacity would still go up so that small@xmath16 absorption can be even more dominant ) .",
    "the dash  dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ 4649spec ] and  [ 4472_4636specs ] show a simple representation of such a model where @xmath17 , @xmath10 , i.e. the canonical adaf values , and where the inner radius at which @xmath18 has been constrained from the vla and scuba measurements to be between @xmath19 to 30 depending on the particular source .",
    "[ 4649spec ] also shows representative blackbody emission originating from the cold gas in the clouds ( the detailed spectrum of the reprocessed and cloud emission is beyond the scope of this paper ; it has been calculated in more detail by kuncic , celotti & rees 1997 ) .    alternatively , within the context of this hypothesis",
    ", most of the emission could be free ",
    "free absorbed by cold material in the disk and what we observe is only the radio emission from the small jets present in these objects . in this connection",
    ", we note that falcke ( 1996 ; also becker & duschl 1997 ) has proposed non  thermal models for the radio emission in sgr .",
    "a@xmath20 assuming that most of the electrons have lorenz factors of around a few hundred .",
    "by requiring that the nonthermal electrons have monoenergetic electron distribution , such a model would be able to reproduce the sharp cut ",
    "offs implied by our vla and scuba observations of ngc 4649 and ngc 4636 ( the nonthermal synchrotron usually has a spectral form @xmath21 ; this means that the optically thin emission would otherwise continue to rise ) .",
    "we note that any mechanism which removes ( or hides ) the inner part of the adaf emission will suffice to bring the model into agreement .",
    "an adaf down to @xmath22 and a bondi flow down to the smallest radii .",
    "variability is also a possibility , but it needs to be very extreme .",
    "this might be related to the large  scale random motions associated with dissipation in adafs ( blackman 1998 ) and ( fairly implausibly ) would need to affect the three objects systematically in the same direction .",
    "more promisingly , as we shall discuss below , a magnetic wind and/or an outflow could suppress the emission from the inner regions of the flow .",
    "it has been shown ( blandford & payne 1982 ) that energy , angular momentum and mass can be removed magnetically from accretion disks , by field lines that leave the disk and extend to large distances . within the context of a self  similar solution it is possible for such a magnetically driven wind to carry away most of the mass and angular momentum at large distances so that the central densities pressures and emissivities can be smaller that of a standard adaf ( begelman & blandford in preparation ) ; the flow can then be geometrically thinner than the standard adaf .",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "[ 4649spec ] ,  [ 4472_4636specs ] ) that by taking @xmath23 with @xmath24 most of the emission from the inner regions of the flow is suppressed and the model is brought into agreement with the observations .",
    "the presence of a magnetically driven wind or some kind of an outflow not only seems plausible in this context , but may also be necessary in order for the adaf solution to have a bernoulli constant less than zero .",
    "as remarked by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) in the self  similar adaf solution the bernoulli parameter ( defined as the sum of the kinetic energy , the potential energy and the enthalpy of the accreting gas ) is positive implying that gas on any streamline can spontaneously escape to infinity .",
    "( in contrast to the standard thin disk , in the adaf case radiation is suppressed and the excess energy production is stored as internal energy , making the bernoulli constant positive ) .",
    "if most of the mass ( not just the angular momentum ) can be extracted at large distances by magnetic torques , the fraction of mass that flows into the very central regions can be quite small . in fig .",
    "[ 4649spec ] and  [ 4472_4636specs ] we show how the radio data can be explained by such a flow ( a hydromagnetic wind can potentially be totally non  radiating ; blandford & payne 1982 ) when we adopt a simple model in which the accretion rate decreases as @xmath16 decreases .",
    "we take @xmath25 down to a maximum radius @xmath26 and @xmath27 from @xmath26 all the way into the centre , where typical values of @xmath28 and @xmath26 are @xmath29 and @xmath30 a few @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "[ 4649spec ] and  [ 4472_4636specs ] illustrate how a decreasing @xmath32 greatly affects the high frequency synchrotron emission component ( and its comptonization ) and not so drastically the bremsstrahlung ( as much of its contribution comes from outer parts of the flow ) .",
    "note , though , that uv / x - ray measurements would be able to discriminate between this model from those in the previous sections ( 4.2 and 4.3 ) . also , because of the additional dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath16 the slope of the self",
    " absorbed synchrotron radiation flattens as @xmath28 increases . in the case of ngc 4649",
    "therefore the slope of the observed spectrum sets an upper limit to @xmath28 which can not much exceed @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ 4649temp_specfig ] ) so that @xmath33 . finally , because at large distances from the disc , the inertia of the gas can cause the magnetic field to become increasing toroidal",
    ", the magnetic stresses could be responsible for converting the centrifugal outflow into a more collimated jet structure ( observed in the radio , see fig .",
    "[ radiomaps ] .",
    "the flow might be more similar to an ion  supported torus ( rees et al .",
    "1982 ) which includes outflows in funnels .",
    "if an outflow does occur ( as seems to be the case for ngc 4472 and ngc 4636 ) it must be fairly well collimated in order that it does not invalidate our accretion estimates .",
    "it is possible that an outflow makes the accretion rate unsteady .",
    "previous work ( fabian & rees 1995 , reynolds et . al . 1996 ,",
    "di matteo & fabian 1997 , mahadevan 1997 ) has suggested that accretion of hot gas in an elliptical galaxy may create the ideal circumstances for an adaf to operate .",
    "the present observational studies , aimed at finding further evidence for of such accretion mode , have shown that new strong physical constraints need to be introduced to the proposed central adaf in such systems .",
    "we have examined new high frequency vla and sub  mm scuba observations of the three giant , low  luminosity elliptical galaxies ngc 4649 , ngc 4472 and ngc 4636 . at these frequencies",
    "the adaf model predicts that the emission is dominated by self ",
    "absorbed thermal synchrotron radiation .",
    "our new radio limits show a severe discrepancy with the canonical adaf predictions and significantly overestimate the observed flux .",
    "while the present observations do not rule out the presence of an adaf in the systems considered , they do place strong constraints on the model .",
    "we have discussed how the emission could be suppressed because either ( 1 ) the magnetic field in the flow is extremely low ( if the viscosity parameter @xmath34 can still be high enough ) or ( 2 ) synchrotron emission is free  free absorbed by cold material in the accretion flow . finally , ( 3 ) we discuss how slow non  radiating accretion flows may drive winds to remove energy , angular momentum and mass so that the central densities , pressure and emissivities are much smaller than in a standard adaf . as most of the accreting gas is lost at large distances , this scenario becomes particularly appealing for explaining very low luminosity systems .",
    "the present observations raise serious issues about the explanation for the quiescence of elliptical galaxies nuclei and possibly other nearby systems now known to posses quiescent supermassive black holes .",
    "the validity of our findings is strengthened by recent radio observations of another source , ngc 4258 ( herrnstein et al . 1998 ) , whose accretion is also modelled via an adaf ( lasota et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the case of ngc 4258 is particularly illustrative : because the relative position of the centre of mass of the sub  parsec molecular disk can be measured to a fraction of a milliarcsecond with vlbi , ngc 4258 has provided a rare opportunity to circumvent the ambiguity associated with core ",
    "jet emission and to test the radio predictions of the adaf spectrum directly .",
    "the potential synchrotron emission in that case also overestimates the maximum possible contribution allowed by the 22 ghz upper limit of herrnstein et al .",
    "the authors show that the potential adaf must occur within @xmath35 .",
    "our two proposed possibilities for the suppression of synchrotron emission would still be viable for ngc 4258 .",
    "in particular , the shearing in the accretion disk might lead to the disruption of cold dense clouds as the material is accreted inward .",
    "the covering fraction might in this case be high enough even in the outer regions , to suppress the lower energy synchrotron radiation .",
    "clearly in the case of ngc 4258 higher frequency radio measurements ( probing the small@xmath16 emission and a possible spectral turnover ) could easily test the plausibility of such an hypothesis .    in conclusion , the compelling observational evidence for adafs in low ",
    "luminosity systems , which could have potentially been found through high radio frequency and sub - mm observations , is still missing .",
    "theoretically , the existence of advection - dominated solution is based on certain critical assumptions , the plausibility of which still needs to be assessed fully . although adafs have been promisingly applied to a great variety of low ",
    "luminosity systems , and convincingly to our galactic centre ( mahadevan 1998 , nbm ) , questions concerning their universality must necessarily be addressed .",
    "recent development of adaf models represents an important step towards the understanding of low efficiency accretion , but further studies are necessary to fully address the different factors regulating low luminosity systems .",
    "x - ray _ axaf _ studies would be crucial for potentially resolving the faint point sources in the nuclei of these elliptical galaxies and therefore providing clues for understanding the fuelling of nearby massive black holes and for potentially discriminating between the different physical constraints on adafs we have discussed in the course of this study .",

    "<S> although x - ray analysis of these galaxy cores provides very strong clues for their extreme quiescence ( and makes the case of advective  accretion plausible ) the new radio limits disagree severely with the canonical adaf predictions which significantly overestimate the observed flux . while the present observations do not rule out the presence of an adaf in the systems considered here , they do place strong constraints on the model </S>",
    "<S> if the accretion in these objects occurs in an advection  dominated mode then our radio limits imply that the emission from their central regions must be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the possibility that the magnetic field in the flow is extremely low or that synchrotron emission is free  </S>",

    "<S> we also discuss whether slow non  radiating accretion flows may drive winds / outflows to remove energy , angular momentum and mass so that the central densities , pressure and emissivities are much smaller than in a standard adaf .    </S>",
