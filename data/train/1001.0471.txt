    "the possibility of pion condensation in nuclear medium was suggested by a.  b.  migdal for the first time in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "thereafter , many studies @xcite of `` in - medium '' pion properties have been performed due to the important consequences in subnuclear physics @xcite , in the physics of neutron stars @xcite , supernovas @xcite , and the heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these analysis considered the pion as an elementary object but we know that they can be considered as nambu - goldstone bosons generated by chiral symmetry breaking . hence the internal structure and the mass of the pion can be sensitive to the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) vacuum modifications in the finite density environment @xcite ; moreover the finite baryon density , and even the isospin density arising from the neutrality condition , can modify the structure of the qcd ground state , and it can in turn produce significant modifications of the pion properties in the medium .    in this work  @xcite , we present the possibility of a charged pion ( @xmath5 ) condensation starting from a _ microscopic _ model which is built with quarks as the constituents of pions , and which exhibits chiral symmetry restoration at the finite quark chemical potential @xmath6 or temperature @xmath7 .",
    "we derive an appropriate criterion for @xmath5 condensation , that we use to show the fragility of the @xmath5 condensation with respect to explicit chiral symmetry breaking via a finite current quark mass .",
    "the conditions for the onset of @xmath5 condensation at finite density are investigated using the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model of qcd .",
    "we find that the threshold for @xmath5 condensation for noninteracting elementary pion gas is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath10 , where @xmath10 is the electric chemical potential and @xmath4 the in - medium pion mass .",
    "finally , we clarify the effect of the current quark mass in the electrically neutral ground state , and the effect of a non - vanishing @xmath10 in presence of a finite current quark mass . based on these analyses , we conclude that @xmath5 condensation is forbidden in realistic neutral quark matter within this effective model .",
    "the njl lagrangian of the model is given for a two - flavor quark matter at a finite chemical potential  @xcite @xmath11~ , \\label{eq : lagr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath12 denotes the electron field , and @xmath13 is the quark spinor with dirac , color and flavor indices ( implicitly summed ) .",
    "the bare quark mass is @xmath14 and @xmath15 the coupling constant .",
    "the electrical chemical potential @xmath10 is necessary to keep the system electrically neutral @xcite , while @xmath16 serves as the isospin chemical potential in the hadron sector , @xmath17 .",
    "the quark chemical potential matrix @xmath18 is defined in flavor - color space as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the identity matrix in color space , @xmath6 is the quark chemical potential related to the conserved baryon number . in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) , we examine the possibility that the ground state develops condensation in the @xmath21 and/or @xmath22 channels , where @xmath23 denotes the pauli matrices . due to the absence of driving forces , we find @xmath24 is always zero",
    ". for convenience we denote @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the numerical analyses ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 so that the model reproduces @xmath29 mev , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 mev in the vacuum with @xmath32 mev .",
    "the pion condensation `` in the vacuum '' ( @xmath33 ) has been investigated with the chiral perturbation approach  @xcite and within njl model  @xcite . in both studies the threshold for the onset of the condensation",
    "is found to be @xmath34 , i.e. , when the absolute value of the electric chemical potential equals the vacuum pion mass .",
    "we now consider neutral quark matter at @xmath35 and @xmath36 and we want to study the relation between the threshold of @xmath5 condensation at finite density and the in - medium pion masses in the neutral ground state ( for further recent studies at finite baryon and/or isospin chemical potential see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that at the physical point @xmath32 mev , there is no room for @xmath5 condensation in the neutral phase ( similar results obtained also in ref .",
    "even though the picture changes when the current mass is lowered , for our discussion it is enough to state that we consider a current quark mass of the order of 10 kev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : masse ] we plot @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the neutral phase as a function of @xmath6 . in this figure @xmath39 , @xmath40 denote the in - medium pion masses defined by the poles of the pion propagators in the rest frame , computed in the randomt phase approximation ( rpa ) to the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation .",
    "the positive and negative solutions of the bs equation in @xmath41 corresponds to the excitation gaps for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . from fig .",
    "[ fig : masse ] we notice that the transition to the pion condensed phase is of second order and it occurs at the point where @xmath46 . for a more detailed mathematical discussion of the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : masse ] we refer to  @xcite .",

    "in the past years , a large number of the analysis about @xmath5 condensation have been performed in the chiral limit . in this section",
    "we investigate the role of the finite current quark mass in @xmath5 condensation . in order to do this , we set the cutoff @xmath49 and the coupling @xmath15 to the values specified above and we treat @xmath0 as a free parameter . as a consequence ,",
    "the pion mass at @xmath50 , @xmath51 in the following , is a free parameter as well .",

    "the solid line represents the border between the two regions where chiral symmetry is broken and restored .",
    "the bold dot is the critical endpoint of the first order transition .",
    "the shaded region indicates the region where @xmath5 condensation occurs . in the chiral limit @xmath53 our results are in good agreement with those obtained in ref .",
    "indeed , there exist two critical values of the quark chemical potential , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , corresponding to the onset and vanishing of @xmath5 condensation , respectively . when the current quark mass increases , a shrinking of the shaded region occurs till the point @xmath56 for @xmath57 , corresponding to a current quark mass of @xmath58 .",
    "hence the gapless @xmath5 condensation is extremely fragile with respect to the symmetry breaking effect of the current quark mass .",

    "[ fig : phasediag ] we report the phase diagram of quark matter in the @xmath59 plane when the current quark mass is tuned to @xmath32 mev . at each value of @xmath59",
    "we compute the chiral and pion condensates by minimization of the thermodynamical potential .",
    "the solid line represents the first order transition from the @xmath5 condensed phase to the chiral symmetry broken phase without the @xmath5 condensate .",
    "the bold dot is the critical endpoint for the first order transition , after which the second order transition sets in .",
    "the dashed line indicates the first order transition between the two regions where chiral symmetry is broken and restored , respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the neutrality line @xmath60 which is obtained by requiring the global electrical neutrality condition , @xmath61 .",
    "the neutrality line manifestly shows the impossibility of finding a @xmath5 condensate , in this physical situation .",
    "we have studied the pion condensation in two - flavor neutral quark matter using the nambu  jona - lasinio model of qcd at finite density .",
    "we have investigated the role of electric charge neutrality , and explicit symmetry breaking via quark mass , both of which control the onset of the charged pion condensation .",
    "we show that the equality between the electric chemical potential and the `` in - medium '' pion mass , @xmath62 , as a threshold , persists even for a composite pion system in the medium , provided the transition to the pion condensed phase is of the second order ( the same qualitative picture has been found also in a recent analysis in the massive gross - neveu model @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we have found that the pion condensate in neutral quark matter is extremely fragile to the symmetry breaking effect via a finite current quark mass @xmath0 , and is ruled out for @xmath0 larger than the order of 10 kev .",
    "a final comment is in order . in this",
    "study the contribution to finite baryon density comes only from the constituent quarks and not from nucleons .",
    "the presence of nucleons may make the pion condensation even less favorable .",
    "the reason can be found in the tomozawa - weinberg pion - nucleon interaction , which is isospin odd , giving rise to a repulsive pion self - energy at the physical situation where the neutron density is larger than the proton density ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for this reason",
    "an interesting investigation may consider the pion condensation with the presence of nucleon degrees of freedom within njl model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for useful prescriptions ) .",
