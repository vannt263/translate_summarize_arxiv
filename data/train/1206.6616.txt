    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions aim at creating matter at extreme conditions of energy density and temperature which is governed by the partonic degrees of freedom called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the main focus of these studies is the observation of quark - hadron phase transition and exploring the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram . in the early phases of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , when a hot and dense region is formed in the core of the reaction zone",
    ", different quark flavors are produced .",
    "then the produced matter undergoes transverse expansion and multiple scattering among the produced particles .",
    "the formation of the hadrons from the partonic phase is accomplished through further expansion and cooling of the system . in proton - proton ( @xmath2 ) collisions ,",
    "the formation of qgp is not expected , whereas a possible formation of qgp is expected in nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions .",
    "hence , a comparative study of produced particles in a+a collisions , with that of @xmath2 collisions , could give better understanding of the properties of the medium formed in a+a collisions .",
    "in the mid - rapidity region , strangeness enhancement has been proposed as a potential signature of qgp @xcite .",
    "strange baryons are produced in strong interaction processes and decay through weak interaction .",
    "it has been observed that multi - strange baryons , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are formed and decouple from the system earlier in time @xcite . due to their different reaction rates in the medium ,",
    "particles with different strangeness decouple at different times .",
    "relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd ) results suggest that the multi - strange baryons freeze - out at energy densities more than @xmath6 @xcite which corresponds to the critical energy density predicted by lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the study of multi - strange baryons are of paramount importance in high energy heavy - ion collisions because of their dominant strangeness content ( s - quark ) .",
    "as the colliding species in nuclear collisions do not contain any strange valence quark , particles with non - zero strange quarks can only be produced out of the collision process .",
    "the production of strange particles is enhanced in a qgp phase compared to a hadronic system .",
    "this is because , the production rate of @xmath7 ( gluon fusion ) is high in a qgp medium @xcite , which is absent in hadronic phase .",
    "in addition , multi - strange baryons are less suffered by hadronic rescatterings in the later stage of the evolution of the fireball because of their small hadronic interaction cross sections .",
    "that is why multi - strange hadrons are good probes to carry the early stage information @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic model estimations on hadron @xmath8 spectra suggest that the thermal freeze - out temperature of multi - strange baryons are close to their chemical freeze - out temperature ( @xmath9 mev ) , which is around the critical temperature , @xmath10 , for deconfinement transition .",
    "this indicates that multi - strange baryons are almost not affected by hadronic rescatterings at the later stage of the heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "hence , multi - strange baryons could carry the information of possible formation of a qgp phase .",
    "it could be envisaged that the multi - strange baryons are formed out of partonic interactions rather than nucleonic interactions .",
    "we shall be justifying this in the following sections .    in this paper ,",
    "both nuclei and nucleons are considered as superposition of constituent or `` dressed '' quarks ( partons or valons ) .",
    "baryons are composed of three and mesons are of two such quarks .",
    "the concept of constituent quarks is very well known @xcite and established in the realm of the discovery of constituent quark scaling of identified particles elliptic flow at rhic @xcite .",
    "the constituent quark approach is successful in explaining many features of hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus @xcite and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "these include global properties like the charged particle and transverse energy density per participant pair @xcite .",
    "qcd calculations support the presence of three objects of size 0.1 - 0.3 fm inside a nucleon @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been seen that nucleus - nucleus collisions and @xmath2 collisions have similar initial states if the results are scaled by the number of constituent quark participants @xcite .",
    "these observations also indicate that the particle production is essentially controlled by number of constituent quarks pairs participating in the collision . in a constituent quark picture , nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) collision looks like a collision of two light nuclei with essentially one @xmath12 pair interacting in the collision , leaving other quarks as spectators .",
    "these quark spectators form hadrons in the nucleon fragmentation region with a part of the entire nucleon energy being used for the particle production ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "but in a+a collisions , due to the large size of the nucleus compared to the nucleon , there is a higher probability of @xmath14 interaction between the projectile and target nucleons .",
    "it has been observed at rhic energies that the production rate of strange and multi - strange baryons in au+au collisions at @xmath15 gev , when scaled by the number of nucleon participants , are different ( get enhanced ) when compared to similar measurements in @xmath2 collisions at same energy @xcite . the observed enhancement increases with strangeness content of the baryons and also as a function of collision centrality , while going from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "similar observations have been made at sps energy for pb+pb collisions at @xmath16 gev , when compared with the corresponding measurements for p+be collisions at the same energy @xcite . in this paper , we have compared the centrality dependence of number of nucleon participant normalized multi - strange baryon enhancement at sps and rhic energies with the expectations from hijing , ampt and urqmd models .",
    "the linear rise of the enhancement seen in the data , gets converted into a spectacular quark - participant scaling behavior when normalized to number of quark - participants . furthermore",
    ", we explore the strangeness scaling , where quark - participant normalized enhancement for different multi - strange baryons , when divided by the strangeness content show a strangeness - independent scaling behavior .",
    "the calculations of the mean number of nucleon / quark participants are done in the following way . in the nuclear overlap model , the mean number of participants , _",

    "i.e. _ @xmath28 , are 42  mb at @xmath29 and 30  mb at @xmath30 . considering proton as a point particle and nucleus as an extended object in a @xmath31 collision ,",
    "the number of participating nucleons is given by @xmath32    in order to calculate the number of quark participants , @xmath1 , in nucleus - nucleus collisions , the density for quarks inside the nucleus is changed to three times that of the nucleon density ( @xmath33 ) . instead of nucleon - nucleon cross section ,",
    "quark - quark cross section is used which is @xmath34 and @xmath35 at @xmath36 200  gev and 17.3 gev , respectively @xcite . in @xmath37 collisions ,",
    "the quark participants are calculated by considering the proton and antiproton as hard sphere of radius 0.8 @xmath38 @xcite . and for asymmetric collisions , like @xmath31 collisions ,",
    "proton is considered as a hard sphere of radius 0.8 @xmath38 and nucleus as extended objects with a woods - saxon density profile .",
    "at lower center of mass energies , it has been found that the particle production scales with the number of participating nucleons , contrary to the case of high energies where hard processes dominate .",
    "hard processes have much smaller cross - section than the soft processes",
    ". however , the number of binary collisions increase with increase in collision centrality faster than the number of participants . as a result ,",
    "the particle production per participant nucleon increases with centrality . by using constituent quark approach",
    ", we are going to show how the particle production at higher energies depends on the participating quarks .",
    "for this , multi - strange particles are chosen because of the proposed signature of strangeness enhancement in qgp medium .",
    "few of the mechanisms for strangeness enhancement include : +  ( i ) the chemical and flavor equilibration time in gluon rich plasma have been predicted to be shorter than a thermally equilibrated hadronic matter of @xmath39 mev @xcite .",
    "gluon fusion ( @xmath7 ) is a dominant production mechanism of strangeness in an equilibrated gluon rich plasma @xcite .",
    "this might allow for strangeness equilibration within the lifetime of qgp and hence resulting in strong enhancement of strangeness compared to a hadronic system .",
    "this enhancement in strangeness can also be explained in the context of statistical mechanics . in @xmath2 system",
    ", the strangeness enhancement is not expected as the available volume is much smaller compared to nucleus - nucleus system .",
    "the @xmath2 system can be treated as canonical system and the net strangeness number should be conserved .",
    "so the s@xmath40 pairs are created at the same point and are annihilated as well , resulting in the suppression of strange hadrons .",
    "but in au+au system , strange and anti - strange hadrons are created independently and statistically distributed over the entire nuclear fireball , which could be treated in a grand canonical ensemble approach ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "as the system thermalizes , the phase space suppression disappears as the volume available is more .",
    "the volume here is linearly proportional to the number of participating nucleons , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath0 . so a relative strangeness enhancement is observed in au+au collisions with respect to @xmath2 collisions @xcite .",
    "+ ( ii ) early stage multiple scattering in heavy - ion collisions , may lead to an increase of the color electric field strength . in string - hadronic model",
    ", particles are produced through fragmenting color field ( string ) in schwinger mechanism @xcite . in high energy heavy - ion collisions",
    ", the string density could be very high so that color flux tubes overlap leading to a superposition of color electric fields .",
    "this results in enhanced production of multi - strange particles .",
    "this mechanism has been verified in the framework of urqmd model with @xmath41 showing an enhancement factor up to 100 @xcite .",
    "+ to study the constituent quarks dependence of strangeness enhancement , we need to estimate the number of participating quarks , which has been done in the framework of nuclear overlap model .",
    "it is very essential to check how good is our estimation of number of participating nucleons in the collision . in order to do that ,",
    "the mean number of participating nucleons , calculated in overlap model , are compared with the number estimated by the star experiment @xcite .",
    "a very good agreement of nuclear overlap model calculations with that of star estimations has been observed .",
    "we have then estimated the number of quark participants within the prescription described in the previous section .",
    "the ratio of quark partipants and nucleon participants has been found to increase monotonically with collision centrality @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath0 , is used to characterize the collision centrality . however , in the constituent quark framework , the nucleon participants no longer bear the meaning of sources of particle production .",
    "it is assumed that in this picture the constituent quarks are participating in the reaction and are the sources of interest for particle production . to understand the collision dynamics ,",
    "the collision data are compared with models like hijing-1.35 , ampt ( default version ) and urqmd-3.3p1 .",
