    "according to general relativity , gravity is the dynamics of spacetime geometry where spacetime is a ( pseudo-)riemannian manifold and the gravitational field is represented by a riemannian metric @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field equations are given by the einstein equations defined by @xmath0 a beauty of the equation ( [ einstein - eq ] ) may be phrased in a poetic diction ( john a. wheeler ) that matter tells spacetime how to curve , and spacetime tells matter how to move .",
    "however the notorious difficulty to elevate the intimate cooperation between spacetime geometry and matters to a quantum world has insinuated doubt into us for the harmonious conspiracy . therefore we will take a closer look at ( [ einstein - eq ] ) aiming to reveal an inmost conflict in ( [ einstein - eq ] ) behind the superficial harmony .",
    "the first observation @xcite is that the gravitation described by ( [ einstein - eq ] ) presupposes a physically inviable vacuum .",
    "if one consider a flat spacetime whose metric is given by @xmath1 , the left - hand side of ( [ einstein - eq ] ) identically vanishes and so the right - hand side must cultivate a completely empty space with @xmath2 .",
    "but the concept of empty space in einstein gravity is in acute contrast to the concept of vacuum in quantum field theory ( qft ) where the vacuum is not empty but full of quantum fluctuations . as a result ,",
    "qft claims that such an empty space of nothing is inviable in nature and , instead , the vacuum is extremely heavy whose weight is maximally of planck mass , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "thus , if there is no way to completely suppress quantum fluctuations , einstein gravity probably either presupposes a physically inviable space or incorrectly identifies the genetic origin of flat spacetime .",
    "the second observation @xcite is that flat spacetime in general relativity behaves like an elastic body with tension although the flat spactime itself is the geometry of special relativity .",
    "we have seen that slides for colloquium introducing general relativity to the public or undergraduate students often contain the image like figure 1 below .",
    "the figure 1 illustrates how a massive body changes the geometry of spacetime around the mass point . in general relativity",
    ", this ( curved ) geometry is described by the gravitational field @xmath4 and interpreted as gravity .",
    "when the massive body moves to another place , the original point where the body was placed will recover a ( nearly ) flat geometry like a rubber band .",
    "that is , the ( flat ) spacetime behaves like a metrical elasticity which opposes the curving of space .",
    "r0.4        but this picture rather exhibits a puzzling nature of flat spacetime because the flat spacetime should be a completely empty space without any kind of energy as we remarked above .",
    "how is it possible for an empty space of nothing to behave like an elastic body with tension ?",
    "moreover we know that the gravitational force is extremely weak which implies that the space strongly withstands the curving and so the tension of spacetime would be extremely big , maybe , of the planck energy .",
    "the third observation @xcite is that the gravitational field @xmath4 has a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , i.e. , @xmath5 like the higgs field @xmath6 .",
    "these two fields also describe particles ( either spin-2 graviton or spin-0 higgs ) as usual quantum fields in standard model .",
    "however these two particles are very exotic because all other fields , denoted as @xmath7 , in standard model have a zero vev ; @xmath8 .",
    "we are reasonably understanding why the higgs field has the nonzero vev which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking . in effect",
    ", standard model is defined in a nontrivial vacuum with the higgs condensate @xmath9 whose dynamical scale is around @xmath10 .",
    "therefore any particle interacting with the higgs field feels a resistance in vacuum and acquires a mass .",
    "what about the flat spacetime @xmath11 ?",
    "is it also originated from some kind of vacuum condensate ?",
    "if so , what is the dynamical scale of the condensate ?",
    "note that the gravitation is characterized by its own intrinsic scale given by the newton constant @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the planck length and classical gravity corresponds to @xmath14 limit .",
    "the fourth observation @xcite is that gravity may be not a fundamental force but an emergent force .",
    "a well - known fact is that graviton is to a messenger particle of the gravitational force as photon is to a messenger particle of the electromagnetic force .",
    "hence the graviton will not be a fundamental particle either , if gravity is not a fundamental force .",
    "in general relativity the gravitational force is represented by a riemannian metric of curved spacetime manifold @xmath15 @xmath16 it is well - known that the metric ( [ metric ] ) in the tetrad formalism can be defined by the tensor product of two vector fields @xmath17 as follows @xmath18 mathematically , a vector field @xmath19 on a smooth manifold @xmath15 is a derivation of the algebra @xmath20 . here",
    "the vector fields @xmath21 are the smooth sections of tangent bundle @xmath22 which are dual to the vector space @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 . the expression ( [ cartan ] )",
    "glimpses the avatar of gravity that a spin - two graviton might arise as a composite of two spin - one _ vector fields_. in other words , the tensor product ( [ cartan ] ) can be abstracted by the relation @xmath25 .",
    "note that any field @xmath7 for fundamental particles in standard model can not be written as the tensor product of other two fields , so to say , @xmath26 . only composite particles ( or bound states ) such as mesons",
    "can be represented in such a way .",
    "therefore graviton represented by the tensor product ( [ cartan ] ) is certainly different from fundamental particles in standard model .",
    "the final observation @xcite is that there is an acute mismatch of symmetry between gravity and matters because gravity is the only interaction sensitive to a shift of the lagrangian by an additive constant . to be precise , if one shift a matter lagrangian @xmath27 by a constant @xmath28 , that is , @xmath29 it results in the shift of the energy - momentum tensor by @xmath30 in the einstein equation ( [ einstein - eq ] ) although the equations of motion for matters are invariant under the shift ( [ shift - l ] ) .",
    "definitely the @xmath28-term in ( [ shift - l ] ) will appear as the cosmological constant in einstein gravity and it affects the spacetime structure . for instance , a flat spacetime is no longer a solution of ( [ einstein - eq ] ) .",
    "even worse is that this clash of symmetry brings about the stability problem of spacetime . as we remarked in the first observation ,",
    "the vacuum in qft is a stormy sea of quantum fluctuations which accommodates the vacuum energy of the order of @xmath31 .",
    "fortunately the vacuum energy due to the quantum fluctuations , regardless of how large it is , does not make any trouble to qft thanks to the symmetry ( [ shift - l ] ) .",
    "however the general covariance requires that gravity couples universally to all kinds of energy . therefore the vacuum energy @xmath32 will induce a highly curved spacetime whose curvature scale @xmath33 would be @xmath34 according to ( [ einstein - eq ] ) .",
    "if so , the qft framework in the background of quantum fluctuations must be broken down due to a large back - reaction of background spacetime .",
    "but we know that it is not the case .",
    "qft is well - defined as ever in the presence of the vacuum energy because the background spacetime still remains flat , as we empirically know .",
    "what is wrong with this argument ?    after consolidating all the suspicions inferred above , we throw a doubt on the genesis that flat spacetime is free gratis , i.e. , costs no energy .",
    "all the above reasonings imply that the negligence about the dynamical origin of flat spacetime defining a local inertial frame in general relativity might be a core root of the incompatibility inherent in ( 1 ) .",
    "it should be remarked that the genesis about spacetime can not be addressed within the context of general relativity because flat spacetime is a geometry of special relativity rather than general relativity and so it is assumed to be _ a priori _ given without reference to its dynamical origin . all in all , it is tempted to infer that flat spacetime may be not free gratis but a result of planck energy condensation in vacuum @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , if that inference is true , it appears as the hly gril to cure several notorious problems in theoretical physics ; for example , to resolve the cosmological constant problem , to understand the nature of dark energy and to explain why gravity is so weak compared to other forces .",
    "after all , the target is to formulate a background independent theory to correctly explain the dynamical origin of flat spacetime .",
    "note that einstein gravity is not completely background independent since it assumes the prior existence of a spacetime manifold .",
    "but it turns out @xcite that the emergent gravity from noncommutative ( nc ) geometry precisely realizes the desired property , as will be surveyed in the next sections .",
    "now we will show that the vierbeins in ( [ cartan ] ) and so the riemannian metrics arise from electromagnetic fields living in a space @xmath35 supporting a symplectic structure @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "gauge fields , we will speculatively touch the issue of emergent time . ]",
    "see @xcite for recent reviews of this subject .",
    "the symplectic structure @xmath36 is a nondegenerate , closed 2-form , i.e. @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "therefore the symplectic structure @xmath36 defines a bundle isomorphism @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an interior product with respect to a vector field @xmath41 .",
    "one can invert this map to obtain the inverse map @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the bivector @xmath46 is called a poisson structure of @xmath15 which defines a bilinear operation on @xmath47 , the so - called poisson bracket , defined by @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "then the real vector space @xmath47 , together with the poisson bracket @xmath50 , forms an infinite - dimensional lie algebra , called a poisson algebra @xmath51 .",
    "first note that the orthonormal tangent vectors @xmath52 satisfy the lie algebra @xmath53 = - { f_{ab}}^c e_c.\\ ] ] in general , the composition @xmath54 $ ] , the lie bracket of @xmath19 and @xmath55 , on @xmath56 , together with the real vector space structure of @xmath56 , forms a lie algebra @xmath57)$ ] .",
    "there is a natural lie algebra homomorphism between the lie algebra @xmath58)$ ] and the poisson algebra @xmath51 defined by @xcite @xmath59 such that @xmath60 for @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to prove the lie algebra homomorphism @xmath61\\ ] ] using the jacobi identity of the poisson algebra @xmath62 .",
    "let us take @xmath63 and a constant symplectic structure @xmath64 , for simplicity .",
    "a remarkable point is that the electromagnetism on a symplectic manifold @xmath65 is completely described by the poisson algebra @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "for example , the action is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 are covariant dynamical coordinates describing fluctuations from the darboux coordinate @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 , and @xmath70 it is clear @xcite that the equations of motion as well as the bianchi identity can be represented only with the poisson bracket @xmath50 : @xmath71 where @xmath72    a peculiar thing for the action ( [ nc - action ] ) is that the field strength @xmath73 in ( [ cc - field ] ) is nonlinear due to the poisson bracket term although it is the curvature tensor of @xmath74 gauge fields .",
    "thus one can consider a nontrivial solution of the following self - duality equation @xmath75 in fact , after the canonical dirac quantization ( [ q - homo ] ) of the poisson algebra @xmath76 , the solution of the self - duality equation ( [ u1-instanton ] ) is known as noncommutative @xmath74 instantons @xcite .",
    "when applying the lie algebra homomorphism ( [ vec - homo ] ) to ( [ cc - field ] ) , we get the identity @xmath77\\ ] ] where the vector fields @xmath78 are obtained by the map ( [ ham - vec ] ) from the set of the covariant coordinates @xmath79 in ( [ coordinate - d ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the self - duality equation ( [ u1-instanton ] ) is mapped to the self - duality equation of the vector fields @xmath80 @xcite : @xmath81 = \\pm \\frac{1}{2 } { \\varepsilon_{ab}}^{cd } [ v_c , v_d].\\ ] ] note that the vector fields @xmath82 are divergence free , i.e. , @xmath83 by the definition ( [ ham - vec ] ) and so preserves a volume form @xmath84 because @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a lie derivative with respect to the vector field @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore it can be shown @xcite that @xmath80 can be related to the vierbeins @xmath87 by @xmath88 with @xmath89 to be determined .",
    "if the volume form @xmath84 is given by @xmath90 or , in other words , @xmath91 , one can easily check that the triple of khler forms for a hyper - khler manifold @xmath15 is given by @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the interior product with respect to @xmath80 and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are self - dual and anti - self - dual t hooft symbols @xcite .",
    "one can prove that gravitational instantons satisfying the self - duality equation @xmath96 are hyper - khler manifolds , i.e. , @xmath97 or @xmath98 and vice versa .",
    "it is straightforward to prove @xcite that the hyper - khler conditions @xmath97 or @xmath99 are precisely equivalent to ( [ u1-graviton ] ) which can easily be seen by applying to ( [ ansatz ] ) the formula @xcite @xmath100 } \\alpha + \\iota_y \\mathcal{l}_x \\alpha      - \\iota_x \\mathcal{l}_y \\alpha + \\iota_x \\iota_y d \\alpha\\ ] ] for vector fields @xmath101 and a @xmath102-form @xmath103 .",
    "in retrospect , the self - dual lie algebra ( [ u1-graviton ] ) was derived from the self - duality equation ( [ u1-instanton ] ) of @xmath74 gauge fields defined on the symplectic manifold @xmath65 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath74 instantons on the symplectic manifold @xmath65 are gravitational instantons @xcite !",
    "we want to emphasize that the emergence of riemannian metrics from symplectic @xmath74 gauge fields is an inevitable consequence of the lie algebra homomorphism between the poisson algebra @xmath51 and the lie algebra @xmath58)$ ] if the underlying action of @xmath74 gauge fields is given by the form ( [ nc - action ] ) .",
    "moreover , the equivalence between @xmath74 instantons in the action ( [ nc - action ] ) and gravitational instantons turns out to be a particular case of more general duality between the @xmath74 gauge theory on a symplectic manifold @xmath104 and einstein gravity @xcite , as will be sketched below .",
    "first of all , we draw general results derived from the lie algebra isomorphism between the poisson algebra @xmath105 and the lie algebra @xmath57)$ ] . since @xmath106 where @xmath107 , the riemannian metric ( [ cartan ] ) is given by @xmath108 or @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a dual basis of @xmath111 .",
    "note that the smooth functions @xmath112 in ( [ coordinate - d ] ) are linearly independent and thus the vector fields @xmath111 defined by ( [ lie - homo ] ) are also linearly independent . accordingly",
    "the vector fields @xmath113 span a full four - dimensional space . in effect , the metric ( [ em - metric ] ) is completely determined by the set ( [ coordinate - d ] ) of @xmath74 gauge fields and it describes a general riemannian manifold .",
    "so far we did not impose the equations of motion ( [ eom - poisson ] ) and the jacobi identity ( [ bi - poisson ] ) on the metric ( [ em - imetric ] ) .",
    "eventually we have to impose them because the set ( [ coordinate - d ] ) of @xmath74 gauge fields obey ( [ eom - poisson ] ) and ( [ bi - poisson ] ) . in order to do that ,",
    "let us apply the lie algebra homomorphism ( [ vec - homo ] ) again to ( [ cov - f ] ) to yield @xmath114 \\in \\gamma(tm).\\ ] ] it is then straightforward to get the following correspondence @xcite",
    "@xmath115 = 0 , \\\\",
    "\\label{corresp - bi } d_a f_{bc } + \\mathrm{cyclic } = 0 \\qquad & \\leftrightarrow & \\qquad [ v_a , [ v_b , v_c ] ] + \\mathrm{cyclic } = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now a critical question is whether the equations of motion ( [ corresp - eom ] ) for gauge fields together with the jacobi ( or bianchi ) identity ( [ corresp - bi ] ) can be written as the einstein equations for the metric ( [ em - imetric ] ) .",
    "a quick notice is that ( [ corresp - eom ] ) and ( [ corresp - bi ] ) will end in some equations related to riemann curvature tensors because they differentiate the metric ( [ em - imetric ] ) twice .    to see what they are , recall that ,",
    "in terms of covariant derivative , the torsion @xmath116 and the curvature @xmath33 can be expressed as follows @xcite @xmath117 , \\\\",

    "an underlying idea is to carefully separate the right - hand side of ( [ corresp - eom ] ) into a part related to the ricci tensor @xmath123 and a remaining part .",
    "basically , we are expecting the following form of the einstein equations @xmath124 after a straightforward but tedious calculation @xcite , we get a remarkably simple but cryptic result @xmath125.\\ ] ] to get the result ( [ emergent - einstein ] ) , we have defined the structure equation of vector fields @xmath111 @xmath126 = - { g_{ab}}^c v_c\\ ] ] and the canonical decomposition @xmath127 a notable point is that the right - hand side of ( [ emergent - einstein ] ) consists of purely interaction terms between self - dual and anti - self - dual parts in ( [ def - g ] ) which is the feature withheld by matter fields only @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the self - duality equation ( [ u1-graviton ] ) can be understood as @xmath128 ( self - dual ) or @xmath129 ( anti - self - dual ) in terms of ( [ def - g ] ) and so @xmath130 in ( [ emergent - einstein ] ) , i.e. , ( [ u1-graviton ] ) describes a ricci - flat manifold .",
    "of course , this is consistent with the fact that a gravitational instanton is a ricci - flat , khler manifold .",
    "nevertheless a unique property of ( [ emergent - einstein ] ) is to contain a nontrivial trace contribution , i.e. , a nonzero ricci scalar , due to the second part which is not existent in einstein gravity as was recently shown in @xcite . by comparing ( [ emergent - einstein ] ) with ( [ einstein - teq ] ) , a surprising content of the energy - momentum tensor was found in @xcite , which will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "we come to the conclusion that general relativity or gravity can emerge from the electromagnetism supported on a symplectic spacetime @xmath35 , which is an interacting theory defined by the action ( [ nc - action ] ) .",
    "how is it possible to realize the equivalence principle or general covariance , the most important property in the theory of gravity ( general relativity ) , from the @xmath74 gauge theory on a symplectic or poisson manifold ?",
    "it turns out @xcite that the poisson structure ( [ poisson ] ) of spacetime admits a novel form of the equivalence principle even for the electromagnetic force , known as the darboux theorem or the moser lemma in symplectic geometry , and consequently the electromagnetism on a symplectic spacetime can be realized as a geometrical property of spacetime . in the end",
    ", the symplectization of spacetime geometry would be a novel and authentic way to quantize gravity @xcite .",
    "we have observed that einstein gravity can be emergent from electromagnetism as long as spacetime admits a symplectic structure and its underlying theory is completely defined by the poisson algebra @xmath131 .",
    "for instance , an underlying dynamical system for gravity is described by the action ( [ nc - action ] ) which leads to the equations of motion ( [ eom - poisson ] ) .",
    "note that the jacobi identity ( [ bi - poisson ] ) is an important property for @xmath62 to be a poisson algebra and to form a lie algebra .",
    "one can understand the lie algebra morphism ( [ lie - homo ] ) as the adjoint map defined by @xmath132 and thence the action of any element on the algebra is a derivation , i.e. , @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "the jacobi identity of the poisson algebra @xmath62 is then equivalent to the identity ( [ vec - homo ] ) between the operators of the adjoint representation .",
    "this identity implies that the map ( [ adjoint - map ] ) sending each element to its adjoint action is a lie algebra homomorphism of the original algebra @xmath62 into the lie algebra @xmath135)$ ] of its derivations .",
    "this is a mathematical basis to explain how gravity is emergent from the electromagnetism on a symplectic manifold @xmath136 .    using the isomorphism between the lie algebras @xmath62 and @xmath137",
    ", we showed that a standard ( commutative ) dynamical system for gravity can be described in terms of vector fields in @xmath137 . recall that vector fields on a usual ( commutative ) space are derivations of the algebra @xmath47 of smooth functions on this space . and vector fields ,",
    "being a global concept , has its noncommutative ( nc ) generalization , called a derivation of nc algebra .",
    "now we will show how the derivation of nc algebra can be obtained by canonically (  la dirac ) quantizing the poisson algebra @xmath131 .",

    "since the action ( [ ikkt ] ) allows infinitely many solutions even with different topologies , it is not unique but there is a natural  primitive \" vacuum defined by @xmath181 where @xmath182 is a constant matrix of rank 4 .",
    "the vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) describes a uniform condensate of nc gauge fields and obeys ( [ m - corresp - eom ] ) and ( [ m - corresp - bi ] ) if @xmath183 satisfy the heisenberg algebra ( [ heisenberg ] ) .",
    "we can also introduce fluctuations over the vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) which are represented by @xmath184 . because there is a hilbert space @xmath139 as a representation space of the heisenberg algebra ( [ heisenberg ] )",
    ", we can regard the matrices @xmath185 as operators in @xmath150 acting on the hilbert space @xmath139 . according to the weyl - moyal map ( [ star - prod ] ) ,",
    "these adjoint operators are in turn mapped to nc fields represented by ( [ nc - field ] ) .",
    "it is worthy of remark that the pith for the duality between geometry and algebra originates from the coherent condensation ( [ vacuum ] ) of quantum harmonic oscillators in vacuum , which grants a symplectic structure to the vacuum .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the nc algebra @xmath150 generated by ( [ heisenberg ] ) admits a nontrivial inner automorphism whose infinitesimal form is called an inner derivation defined by ( [ nc - deriv ] ) . as a result",
    ", the dynamics of fluctuations on the vacuum ( [ heisenberg ] ) can always be described by the inner derivations of the algebra @xmath150 , as was verified in ( [ q - corresp - eom ] ) and ( [ q - corresp - bi ] ) .",
    "we showed that their commutative limit is nothing but the einstein gravity or general relativity .",
    "now we are ready to disclose the secret nature of spacetime we have posed in the introduction . because the ikkt matrix model ( [ ikkt ] ) does not assume any prior existence of spacetime from the beginning , in other words , ( [ ikkt ] ) is a background independent theory , it is necessary to define a configuration in the algebra @xmath150 , for instance , like ( [ vacuum ] ) , to generate any kind of spacetime structure , even for flat spacetime .",
    "so the question is : what is the spacetime emergent from the vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) which signifies a uniform condensate of nc gauge fields in vacuum ?",
    "the definition ( [ nc - deriv ] ) immediately says that the corresponding vector field @xmath186 for the vacuum gauge field @xmath187 is precisely that of flat spacetime , i.e. , @xmath188 .",
    "see ( [ em - metric ] ) for the metric where @xmath189 in this case .",
    "remarkably the vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) responsible for the flat spacetime is not an empty space unlike general relativity .",
    "instead the flat spacetime is emergent from a uniform condensation of gauge fields in vacuum @xcite .",
    "its surprising consequences will be discussed in next section .",
    "to recapitulate , it was shown that the symplectic structure of spacetime @xmath15 leads to an isomorphism between symplectic geometry @xmath35 and riemannian geometry @xmath190 where the deformations of symplectic structure @xmath36 in terms of electromagnetic fields @xmath191 are transformed into those of riemannian metric @xmath192 .",
    "this approach for quantum gravity allows a background independent formulation which provides a novel and authentic way to quantize gravity @xcite . as such",
    ", the theory should be formulated in a way that the spacetime geometry arises from a vacuum solution to the field equation of the theory .",
    "one should not have to specify a preferred background spacetime in order to write down the field equations .",
    "the theory ( [ ikkt ] ) described by large @xmath193 matrices is precisely the case .",
    "indeed , the flat spacetime arises from the vacuum solution ( [ vacuum ] ) .",
    "all other fluctuations over the vacuum are represented by nc @xmath74 gauge fields with the action ( [ q - action ] ) , whose commutative limit @xmath164 reduces to the action ( [ nc - action ] ) we will mostly focus on .",
    "only these fluctuations will deform the vacuum geometry as @xmath194 or @xmath195 , according to the map ( [ lie - homo ] ) .",
    "one immediate conclusion is , thus , that a uniform condensation of gauge fields such as the vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) does _ not _ gravitate @xcite because it is simply responsible for the generation of flat spacetime .",
    "a natural question is then what is the dynamical scale of the vacuum condensate ( [ vacuum ] ) .    because gravity emerges from nc @xmath74 gauge fields described by the action ( [ nc - action ] ) or ( [ q - action ] ) , the parameters , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , defining the nc gauge theory should be related to the newton constant @xmath198 in emergent gravity .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis leads to the relation @xcite @xmath199 then one can immediately estimate the vacuum energy @xmath200 caused by the condensate ( [ vacuum ] ) : @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the planck mass and @xmath203 . finally the emergent gravity reveals a remarkable picture that the condensation of planck energy in vacuum is actually the origin of flat spacetime .",
    "that is to say , the huge planck energy ( [ v - energy ] ) was simply used to make a flat spacetime .",
    "hence we can conclude that the vacuum energy @xmath204 does not gravitate , which is a tangible difference from einstein gravity .",
    "it is of prime importance that the emergent gravity should not contain a coupling of cosmological constant like @xmath205 .",
    "this important conclusion may be more strengthened by looking at the definition ( [ lie - homo ] ) of emergent metric which is insensitive to a constant vacuum energy because it requires the identity @xmath206 for a constant field strength @xmath182 .",
    "consequently , the emergent gravity clearly dismisses the cosmological constant problem @xcite .    as a necessary consequence ,",
    "the emergent gravity respects the shift symmetry ( [ shift - l ] ) .",
    "for example , under a shift in the @xmath36-field , @xmath207 , with @xmath208 a constant antisymmetric tensor , the nc field theory ( [ q - action ] ) defined in the new background @xmath209 is physically equivalent to that in the old one @xmath210 due to the well - known seiberg - witten equivalence @xcite .",
    "moreover the hilbert spaces @xmath211 and @xmath212 for the heisenberg algebra ( [ heisenberg ] ) are isomorphic to each other . also the vector fields @xmath213 and @xmath214 determined by @xmath215 and @xmath36 backgrounds are equally flat as long as they are constant .",
    "this means that the shift symmetry ( [ shift - l ] ) belongs to a global automorphism ( a darboux transformation ) of the nc algebra @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath216 , which can be interpreted as a global lorentz transformation @xcite .",
    "if a flat spacetime emerges from the planck energy condensation ( [ v - energy ] ) in vacuum , would set a natural dynamical scale for the emergence of gravity and spacetime .",
    "] we can draw several interesting implications ( though necessarily speculative ) which seem to resolve all the puzzles posed in the introduction .",
    "first of all , it implies that spacetime will behave like an elastic body with the tension of planck energy @xcite . in other words , gravitational fields generated by the deformations of the background ( [ vacuum ] ) will be very weak because the spacetime vacuum is very solid with a stiffness of the planck mass .",
    "therefore the dynamical origin of flat spacetime explains the metrical elasticity opposing the curving of space as depicted in figure 1 and the stunning weakness of gravitational force @xcite .",
    "furthermore the emergent spacetime implies that the global lorentz symmetry , being an isometry of flat spacetime , should be a perfect symmetry up to the planck scale because the flat spacetime was originated from the condensation of the maximum energy in nature .",
    "the emergence of spacetime by the vacuum condensate ( [ vacuum ] ) probably also has very interesting implications to cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the vacuum algebra ( [ heisenberg ] ) describes an extremely coherent condensation because it is the heisenberg algebra of two - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator . as a result",
    ", the spacetime vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) should describe a zero - entropy state in spite of the involvement of planck energy like as the electrical resistance of superconductors is zero because the cooper pair condensate moves as a coherent quantum mechanical entity .",
    "it is very mysterious but it should be the case , because the flat spacetime is a completely empty space from the viewpoint of general relativity and so has no entropy .",
    "the thermodynamic laws then suggest that a global time evolution of universe will have an arrow since the entropy of universe has to increase anyway since its birth .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the coherent condensate ( [ vacuum ] ) of spacetime ",
    "monads \" may explain _ the arrow of time _ in the cosmic evolution of our universe .",
    "one may envisage a spontaneous creation of an exponentially expanding universe .",
    "but one could not say that the de sitter universe was created out of field energy in a preexisting space .",
    "if we intend to understand the planck energy condensation in vacuum as a dynamical process , the time scale for the condensate will be roughly of the planck time .",
    "thus it is natural to consider that the explosive inflation era that lasted roughly @xmath217 seconds at the beginning of our univese corresponds to the dynamical process for the instantaneous condensation of vacuum energy @xmath204 to enormously spread out a spacetime .",
    "a simple consideration of energy conservation for the condensate leads to the expansion rate @xmath218 where @xmath219 .",
    "this implies that the dynamical process for the vacuum condensate may explain a cosmic inflation to generate an extremely large spacetime @xmath220 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to microscopically describe this dynamical process by using the matrix action ( [ ikkt ] ) . nevertheless , it is quite obvious that the cosmic inflation should be a dynamical condensation in vacuum for the generation of spacetime according to our emergent gravity picture @xcite .",
    "note that the vacuum condensate ( [ vacuum ] ) causes the microscopic spacetime to be nc and so introduces a spacetime uncertainty relation .",
    "therefore , a further accumulation of energy over the nc spacetime ( [ heisenberg ] ) will be subject to the uv / ir mixing @xcite .",
    "this spacetime exclusion will prevent a very localized energy from further condensing into the vacuum , which may correspond to the stability of spacetime .",
    "this reasoning implies that the condensation of the vacuum energy ( [ v - energy ] ) happened at most only once . by the same reason",
    ", the cosmic inflation should take place only once and , thereby , eternal inflation and cyclic universe seem to be inconsistent with our picture @xcite .    the special relativity unifies space and time into a single entity  spacetime .",
    "hence it will be desirable to put space and time on an equal footing . if a space is emergent , so should time .",
    "but the concept of time is more stringent since it is difficult to give up the causality and unitarity .",
    "we believe that a naive introduction of nc time , e.g. , @xmath221 = i\\theta$ ] , will be problematic because it is impossible to keep the locality in time with the nc time and so to protect the causality and unitarity .",
    "how can we define the emergent time together with the emergent space ? how is it entangled with the space to unfold into a single entity ",
    "spacetime and to take the shape of lorentz covariance ?",
    "a decisive lesson comes from quantum mechanics .",

    "this equation can be integrated to give a finite time evolution given by @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the time evolution operator .",
    "therefore , as we know well , an intrinsic ( particle ) time in quantum mechanics is defined as an inner automorphism of nc algebra @xmath225 .",
    "note that the time evolution ( [ time - ev ] ) is meaningful only if the underlying algebra @xmath225 is nc but it does not require an operator or nc time to describe the history of the particle system .",
    "a notable point is that any poisson manifold @xmath228 always admits a dynamical hamiltonian system on @xmath15 where the poisson structure @xmath229 is a bivector in @xmath230 and the dynamics of a system is described by the hamiltonian vector field @xmath231 of an underlying poisson algebra @xcite .",
    "after a ( dirac or deformation ) quantization of the poisson algebra , one can describe the dynamics of the system in terms of derivations of an underlying nc algebra . for example , in the classical limit @xmath232 , the heisenberg equation ( [ h - eq ] ) reduces to the classical hamilton s equation @xmath233 where @xmath234 is a hamiltonian vector field defined by @xmath235 with the symplectic structure @xmath236 of the particle phase space .",
    "in order to get an insight about the emergent time , it would be worthwhile to realize that the mathematical structure of emergent gravity is basically the same as quantum mechanics .",
    "the former is based on the nc space ( [ heisenberg ] ) while the latter is based on the nc phase space ( [ qm ] ) .",
    "therefore we can also apply the same philosophy to the case of nc spacetime @xcite .",

    "conversely , the heisenberg equation ( [ nch - eq ] ) is the quantization of the classical hamilton s equation ( [ c - time ] ) following the rule ( [ derivation ] ) .",
    "but , if the hamiltonian @xmath241 is time - independent , one can infer by analogy with quantum mechanics that the heisenberg equation ( [ nch - eq ] ) describes only an internal time evolution over the space .",

    "but note that the original vector fields @xmath265 remain intact because of the relation @xmath266 .",

    "the wick rotation will be defined by @xmath290 . under this wick rotation , we get the results @xmath291 and @xmath292 in minkowski spacetime . there are some reasons that the energy - momentum tensor ( [ em - maxwell ] ) has to be mapped to the one of the usual maxwell theory in commutative spacetime .",
    "indeed it was argued in @xcite that it can be done by reversing the map ( [ lie - homo ] ) .",
    "but , as we already remarked in section 2 , the engrossing part is ( [ em - de ] ) since it is absent in einstein gravity and would be a rather unique feature of emergent gravity . since we are eventually interested in a long - wavelength limit , we will take only the scalar mode in ( [ em - de ] ) which will be a source of the expansion / contraction of spacetime .",
    "this will be a good approximation since the remaining term corresponds to a quadruple mode which gives rise to the shear distortion of spacetime and can thus be neglected . for the same reason , we can ignore the maxwell energy - momentum tensor ( [ em - maxwell ] ) since it is also a purely quadruple mode .",
    "hence , in the long - wavelength limit where @xmath293 and @xmath294 , the energy - momentum tensor ( [ em - de ] ) simply reduces to @xcite @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the ricci - scalar of the metric ( [ em - metric ] ) .",

    "@xmath306    we will argue @xcite that the weird energy ( [ de-2 ] ) would be originated from  vacuum fluctuations \" with the largest possible wavelength @xmath301 due to the uv / ir mixing triggered by the noncommutativity of spacetime @xcite . recall that the vacuum energy @xmath204 does not couple to gravity since it was used to create a flat spacetime in our picture .",

    "although our conclusion about the dark energy may be too speculative and so a full - fledged formulation is further required , we believe that the emergent gravity from nc gauge fields has plenty of rooms to explain the nature of dark energy and our underlying arguments must be true even in a full - fledged theory .",
    "it has been hoped that a physically viable theory of quantum gravity would unify into a single consistent model all fundamental interactions and describe all known observable interactions in the universe , at both subatomic and astronomical scales .",

    "therefore let us introduce 10-dimensional coordinates @xmath344 and 10-dimensional connections defined by @xmath345 as a result , the large-@xmath193 matrices in the action ( [ n=4 ] ) are now represented by their master fields which are higher - dimensional nc @xmath74 gauge fields in ( [ 10d - conn ] ) whose field strength is given by @xmath346_\\star.\\ ] ] in the end , the 4-dimensional @xmath329 yang - mills theory ( [ n=4 ] ) has been transformed into a 10-dimensional nc @xmath74 gauge theory and the action ( [ n=4 ] ) can be recast into the simple form @xcite @xmath347    to find a gravitational metric dual to the large-@xmath193 gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] ) or , equivalently , to find an emergent metric determined by the nc gauge theory ( [ 10-action ] ) , we can apply the adjoint operation ( [ nc - deriv ] ) to the 10-dimensional nc gauge fields in ( [ 10d - conn ] ) after switching the index @xmath348 : @xmath349(x ) & = & [ d_a , \\widehat{f}]_\\star ( x , y ) \\nonumber \\\\    & = & v_a^m ( x , y ) \\partial_m f(x , y ) + \\mathcal{o}(\\theta^3)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath350 . in the commutative limit ,",
    "the vector fields @xmath351 on a 10-dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath15 is given by @xmath352 or their dual basis @xmath353 is given by @xmath354 where @xmath355 and @xmath356 hence the 10-dimensional geometry dual to the gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] ) or ( [ 10-action ] ) can easily be determined by @xcite @xmath357 where @xmath358 and the conformal factor is defined by @xmath359 for a 10-dimensional volume form @xmath360 or , more generally , @xmath361 .",
    "it has been known from the ads / cft duality @xcite that the large-@xmath193 gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] ) is a nonperturbative formulation of type iib string theory on @xmath362 background .",
    "we have verified above that the 4-dimensional @xmath329 gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] ) gives rise to a 10-dimensional gravity with the metric ( [ 10-metric ] ) @xcite .",
    "we see that the existence of nontrivial gauge fields @xmath363 causes the curving of the original flat spacetime @xmath340 and so the four - dimensional spacetime also becomes dynamical together with an entirely emergent 6-dimensional space .",
    "therefore , the large-@xmath193 gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] ) almost provides a background independent description of spacetime geometry except the original background @xmath340 whose existence was _ a priori _ assumed at the outset .",
    "we confirm again the important picture @xcite that , in order to describe a classical geometry from a background independent theory , it is necessary to have a nontrivial vacuum defined by a",
    " coherent \" condensation of gauge fields , e.g. , the vacuum defined by ( [ n=4-vacuum ] ) .    a remarkable aspect of the large-@xmath193 gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] )",
    "is that it admits a rich variety of topological objects .",
    "so our curiosity is what kind of geometry emerges from such a topological object ( according to the map ( [ matrix - ad ] ) ) when the topological solution has been defined by the gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] ) or ( [ 10-action ] ) and what kind of object is materialized in four - dimensional spacetime from the stable solution .",
    "we will assert that consolidating some generic features of emergent geometry and the feynman s picture about the weak and strong forces leads to a remarkable picture for what matter is .",
    "in particular , a matter field such as leptons and quarks may simply arise as a stable localized geometry in extra dimensions , which is a topological object in the defining algebra ( nc @xmath152-algebra ) of quantum gravity .",
    "consider a stable class of time - independent solutions in the action ( [ n=4 ] ) satisfying the asymptotic boundary condition ( [ n=4-vacuum ] ) .",
    "for such kind of solutions , we may forget about time and work in the temporal gauge , @xmath364 .",
    "since the adjoint scalar fields asymptotically approach the common limit ( [ n=4-vacuum ] ) ( which does not depend on @xmath365 ) , we can think of @xmath325 as having the topology of a three - sphere @xmath366 , with the point at infinity included .",
    "in particular , the matrices @xmath367 are nondegenerate along @xmath368 and so @xmath369 defines a well - defined map @xmath370 from @xmath368 to the group of nondegenerate complex @xmath371 matrices . if this map represents a nontrivial class in the third homotopy group @xmath372 , the solution ( [ homotopy ] )",
    "will be stable under small perturbations , and the corresponding nontrivial element of @xmath373 represents a topological invariant @xcite . in the stable regime where @xmath374 , the homotopy groups of @xmath375 or @xmath329 define a generalized cohomology theory , known as k - theory @xmath376 @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath377 , this group with compact support is given by @xcite @xmath378 note that the map ( [ homotopy ] ) is contractible to the group of maps from @xmath368 to @xmath329 .",
    "we now come to the connection with k - theory , via the classic atiyah - bott - shapiro ( abs ) construction @xcite which relates the grothendieck groups of clifford modules to the k - theory of spheres .",
    "the abs isomorphism relates complex and real clifford algebras to k - theory @xcite : such a relation is somehow expected , given that the periodicity of k - theory is similar to the periodicity of clifford algebras @xcite .",
    "note that the group @xmath376 also classifies d - branes in type ii superstring theory on a manifold @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rr - charge of type iib d - branes is measured by the k - theory class of their transverse space , so that @xmath379 classifies @xmath380-branes in type iib string theory on flat @xmath381 spacetime .",
    "the abs construction uses the gamma matrices of the lorentz group @xmath382 to construct an explicit generator of the k - theory group ( [ k - group ] ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath383 be two irreducible spinor representations of @xmath384 and define the gamma matrices @xmath385 to satisfy the dirac algebra @xmath386 .",
    "let us also introduce the dirac operator @xmath387 such that @xmath388 where @xmath389 is a four - momentum and the abbreviation denotes possible higher order corrections in higher energies . here",
    "the dirac operator ( [ dirac - op ] ) is regarded as a linear operator acting on a hilbert space @xmath139 as well as the spinor vector space @xmath383 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath139 would be possibly much smaller than the primitive fock space for the heisenberg algebra ( [ nc6 ] ) because the dirac operator ( [ dirac - op ] ) actually acts on collective ( coarse grained ) modes of the solution ( [ homotopy ] ) @xcite .    in order to construct stable topological objects that take values in the k - theory ( [ k - group ] ) ,",
    "it is natural to consider topological solutions made out of @xmath390 according to the homotopy map ( [ homotopy ] ) .",
    "as was shown before , the large-@xmath193 matrices in @xmath391 gauge theory can be described by nc @xmath74 gauge fields with the action ( [ 10-action ] ) in higher dimensions . in particular , the adjoint scalar fields",
    "@xmath392 are mapped to nc @xmath74 gauge fields in extra dimensions and obey the relation @xmath393 = -b_{ab } + \\widehat{f}_{ab}.\\ ] ] therefore , the topological solutions made out of @xmath394 will be given by nc @xmath74 instantons in four or six dimensions .",
    "for instance , in four - dimensional subspace , one can consider nc @xmath74 instanton solutions given by @xcite @xmath395 where @xmath396 and , in six dimensions , one can instead consider nc hermitian @xmath74 instantons defined by @xcite @xmath397 where @xmath398 is a nondegenerate symplectic matrix defined by the vacuum ( [ n=4-vacuum ] ) .",
    "we showed in section 2 that the nc @xmath74 instantons in commutative limit are equivalent to gravitational instantons which are hyper - khler manifolds and also called calabi - yau 2-folds @xcite .",
    "similarly it can be shown @xcite that the 6-dimensional nc hermitian @xmath74 instantons satisfying ( [ nc-6inst1 ] ) and ( [ nc-6inst2 ] ) can be recast into calabi - yau 3-folds using the vector fields defined by ( [ matrix - ad ] ) . if we define a gravitational instanton as a ricci - flat , khler manifold , the calabi - yau 3-fold corresponds to a 6-dimensional gravitational instanton .",
    "it is well - known that gravity can be formulated as a gauge theory of lorentz group . in this gauge theory formulation ,",
    "calabi - yau @xmath399-folds correspond to @xmath318 yang - mills instantons in @xmath400-dimensions and the gauge group @xmath318 appears as the holonomy group of a calabi - yau @xmath399-fold @xcite . combining the relationship between nc @xmath74 instantons , @xmath318 yang - mills instantons and calabi - yau @xmath399-folds altogether",
    ", we get the trinity of instantons @xcite depicted in figure [ trinity ] .",
    "trinity of instantons .",
    "( image from @xcite),scaledwidth=50.0% ]    according to the above construction , the topological solution ( [ homotopy ] ) takes a value in the k - theory group ( [ k - group ] ) and is realized as a stable geometry , i.e. , a calabi - yau manifold , in extra dimensions .",
    "and the abs theorem says that the stable topological solution is represented by the dirac operator ( [ dirac - op ] ) on the spacetime @xmath340 .",
    "in other words , the calabi - yau manifold constructed from a nc @xmath74 instanton in extra dimensions will be realized as a four - dimensional fermion @xmath401 whose dispersion relation in low energies is given by the relativistic dirac equation @xmath402 as was already suggested by the dirac operator ( [ dirac - op ] ) .",
    "although the emergence of 4-dimensional spinors from large-@xmath193 matrices or nc gauge fields is just a consequence of the fact that the abs construction uses the clifford algebra to construct explicit generators of @xmath403 , its physical origin is mysterious and difficult to understand .",
    "recall that the weyl spinor in ( [ dirac - eq ] ) is originated from nc @xmath74 instantons in extra @xmath400-dimensions which are also realized as calabi - yau @xmath399-folds with @xmath318 holonomy .",
    "therefore the 4-dimensional spinor @xmath404 should be charged under the @xmath405 gauge group and so can couple to @xmath318 gauge fields in four dimensions . if so , our last question is how non - abelian gauge fields @xmath406 on @xmath340 can arise from the @xmath74 gauge fields on @xmath407 .",
    "to recapitulate , the @xmath391 gauge theory ( [ n=4 ] ) in the moyal background ( [ n=4-vacuum ] ) has been mapped to the 10-dimensional nc @xmath74 gauge theory ( [ 10-action ] ) defined on the space @xmath408 . then the k - theory ( [ k - group ] ) for any sufficiently large @xmath193 can be identified with the k - theory @xmath409 for the nc @xmath152-algebra @xmath150 .",
    "but , if we consider low - energy excitations around the solution ( [ homotopy ] ) whose k - theory class is given by @xmath409 and that would be a sufficiently localized state described by a compact ( bounded self - adjoint ) operator in @xmath150 , it will not appreciably disturb the ambient gravitational field .",
    "this means @xcite that we may reduce the problem to a quantum particle dynamics on @xmath410 where @xmath312 is an internal space describing collective modes of the solution ( [ homotopy ] ) .",
    "it is natural to identify the coordinate of @xmath312 with an internal charge carried by the weyl fermion @xmath404 in ( [ dirac - eq ] ) .",
    "we observed above that the ( collective ) coordinates of @xmath312 will take values in the @xmath318 lie algebra such as the isospins or colors and will be denoted by @xmath411 .",
    "it is useful to remember that the vacuum algebra ( [ nc6 ] ) is nothing but the @xmath412-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators with the heisenberg algebra @xmath413 = i\\theta^{ab } \\qquad \\leftrightarrow \\qquad     [ a_i , a_j^\\dagger ] = \\delta_{ij}\\ ] ] where @xmath414 and @xmath415 .",
    "there is a well - known fact that the @xmath399-dimensional harmonic oscillator can realize an @xmath318 symmetry and the generators of the @xmath318 lie algebra are given by @xmath416 where @xmath417 are constant @xmath418 matrices satisfying the @xmath318 lie algebra @xmath419 = i \\hbar f^{ijk } t^k$ ] .",
    "it is easy to check that the schwinger representation ( [ schwinger ] ) satisfies the commutation relations in ( [ feynman - comm1])-([feynman - comm3 ] ) .",
    "as was reasoned above , the @xmath318 generators in ( [ schwinger ] ) can be regarded as low - energy collective modes ( or order parameters ) in the vicinity of the solution ( [ homotopy ] ) .    since the chiral fermion @xmath404 in ( [ dirac - eq ] )",
    "is charged under the @xmath318 symmetry whose generators are given by ( [ schwinger ] ) , it can interact with four - dimensional @xmath318 gauge fields @xmath420 .",
    "let @xmath421 be a representation of the lie algebra ( [ schwinger ] ) .",
    "we will take an @xmath399-dimensional representation in @xmath422 which is much smaller than the original fock space of ( [ 3-ho ] ) .",
    "since we are considering a low - energy limit where gravitational back - reactions are ignored , it will be reasonable to take only the lowest modes of nc @xmath74 gauge fields @xmath423 as a low - energy approximation .",
    "so we will expand the @xmath74 gauge fields @xmath424 in ( [ matrix - fluc ] ) with the @xmath318 basis in ( [ schwinger ] ) @xmath425 where it is assumed that each term in ( [ expansion - u1 ] ) belongs to an irreducible representation of @xmath421 . through the expansion ( [ expansion - u1 ] )",
    ", we get @xmath318 gauge fields @xmath420 as well as ordinary @xmath74 gauge fields @xmath363 as low lying excitations @xcite .",
    "the coarse - grained fermion @xmath404 in ( [ dirac - eq ] ) behaves like a stable relativistic particle in the spacetime @xmath340 .",
    "hence , when the particle moves along @xmath426 , there will be bosonic excitations arising from changing the position in @xmath426 of the internal charge @xmath312 according to the relation @xmath427 and the wong s equation ( [ wong - h ] ) .",
    "that is , we can think of the dirac operator ( [ dirac - op ] ) as an operator @xmath428 where @xmath422 and introduce a minimal coupling with the @xmath74 and @xmath318 gauge fields in ( [ expansion - u1 ] ) by the replacement @xmath429 . then the dirac equation ( [ dirac - eq ] ) becomes @xmath430 here we see that the chiral fermion @xmath404 in the homotopy class @xmath403 is in the fundamental representation of @xmath318 . as a result , the spinor in ( [ dirac - coupling ] ) can be identified with a quark , an @xmath328 multiplet of chiral weyl fermions interacting with gluons @xmath431 for @xmath432 and with a lepton , an @xmath327 doublet of chiral weyl fermions interacting with isospin gauge fields @xmath433 for @xmath434 @xcite .",
    "we want to point out that the emergent matters from stable geometries in extra dimensions are consistent with the calabi - yau compactification in string theory . in string theory ,",
    "a calabi - yau manifold serves as an internal geometry of string theory with 6 extra dimensions and their shapes and topology determine a detailed structure of the multiplets for elementary particles and gauge fields through the compactification , which leads to a low - energy phenomenology in four dimensions .",
    "a very similar picture seems to be also realized in the context of emergent geometry via the abs theorem and the trinity of instantons illustrated in figure [ trinity ] .",
    "to conclude , we have observed that the theory ( [ n=4 ] ) allows topologically stable solutions as long as the homotopy group ( [ k - group ] ) is nontrivial .",
    "remarkably , a matter field such as leptons and quarks simply arises from such a stable solution and non - abelian gauge fields correspond to collective zero - modes of the stable localized solution ( [ homotopy ] ) .",
    "although the solution ( [ homotopy ] ) is interpreted as particles and gauge fields ignoring their gravitational effects , we have to recall that it is a stable excitation over the vacuum ( [ n=4-vacuum ] ) and so originally a part of spacetime geometry according to the map ( [ matrix - ad ] ) .",
    "consequently , we get a remarkable picture , if any , that matter fields such as leptons and quarks simply arise as a stable localized geometry , which is a topological object in the defining algebra ( nc @xmath152-algebra ) of quantum gravity .",
    "this approach for quantum gravity thus allows a novel unification where spacetime as well as matter fields is equally emergent from a universal vacuum of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "we believe that such an elegant unification of geometry and matters is a unique feature realized only in the background independent formulation of quantum gravity .",
