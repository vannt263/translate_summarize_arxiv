    "significant efforts have been expended recently in the development of new and reliable single - photon sources , due to an increasing number of applications of such sources in quantum optics , namely in quantum cryptography and for the realization of quantum gates  @xcite .",
    "for instance , basic security proofs of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) rely on encoding information on single quantum objects , namely single - photon light pulses  @xcite . most practical qkd systems use weak coherent pulses as an approximation of single - photon sources , which greatly simplifies the experimental implementation  @xcite . however , faint laser pulses with mean photon number smaller than unity can still contain more than one photon due to poissonian photon number statistics .",
    "increasing attenuation on the quantum channel to lower the probability of multiphoton pulses is a practical solution , but it also reduces the secret key creation rate . moreover , due to dark count noise of the detectors , the vulnerability of the most commonly used qkd bennett and brassard bb84 protocol  @xcite increases with losses on the transmission channel  @xcite . to improve security of long - distance qkd , one as either to conceive of new protocols , like the one relying on decoy states  @xcite , or to switch to single - photon sources .",
    "single photons can be conditionally prepared using a pair emission process like atomic cascade  @xcite or spontaneous parametric down - conversion  @xcite .",
    "one photon of the emitted pair is used as a `` trigger '' which prepares the field modes corresponding to the second photon in a single - photon state . with this scheme ,",
    "heralded single photons at telecom wavelengths can be efficiently prepared using bulk @xmath3 nonlinear crystals  @xcite , or guided - wave nonlinear devices  @xcite .",
    "these systems have been experimentally confirmed as promising for optical fiber - based long - distance qkd  @xcite .",
    "however , emission time remains random for this type of single - photon generation . in quantum cryptography - based communication system , it is highly desirable to deal with single photons synchronized on an external clock .",
    "clock - triggered single - photons can be efficiently produced by suited pulsed excitation of the emitting dipole  @xcite , which should undergo a full cycle , including excitation , emission and reexcitation before it emits the next photon . since first proposal by de martini _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite a wide variety of schemes to implement a single - photon source have been worked out , relying on the fluorescence of an isolated single emitter , such as a molecule , an atom , a colour centre , and a semiconductor quantum dot  ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "a reliable room - temperature clock - triggered single - photon source was recently realized , based on the pulsed optically excited photoluminescence of a single nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) colour centre in a diamond nanocrystal  @xcite .",
    "this turn - key single - photon source was then implemented in qkd experiments using bb84 protocol with polarization - encoded single - photon sequences  @xcite .",
    "as theoretically expected  @xcite , use of single - photon light pulses showed measurable advantages over faint laser pulses in terms of security of the quantum channel and key creation rate in the high attenuation regime .",
    "the wide variety of photostable colour centres in diamond  @xcite offers high opportunity to optimize single - photon properties so that they better meet application requirements for practical qkd .",
    "for instance , polarized single - photon emission , together with nanosecond - range excited state lifetime and nanometer spectral bandwidth , should be achieved .",
    "recently , the nickel - related ne8 defect was observed at the single emitter level , both in natural diamond sample  @xcite and in cvd diamond film  @xcite .",
    "this colour centre , which consists in a nickel atom in divacancy position and four nitrogen atoms in its first coordination sphere , is characterized by a weak electron - phonon coupling .",
    "most of its photoluminescence is then concentrated within its zero - phonon line , corresponding to a sharp emission line ( fwhm 1.5 nm ) around 800  nm .",
    "we report on the observation at room temperature of single diamond colour centres with perfect photostable luminescence at room temperature , in the same wavelength range as the ne8 colour centre . assumed to be also nickel - nitrogen related impurities",
    ", we study in details their photoluminescence properties under optical excitation with a red cw laser diode .",
    "both single - photon emission and shelving in a metastable level are observed from photon time - correlation measurements , with an hanbury brown & twiss setup .",
    "we show that these emitters meet the required properties for practical single - photon qkd as stated above .",
    "first , a narrow emission band is observed around 782  nm , which is both in the open - air and fiber - optics optical communication window .",
    "second , an excited - level lifetime around 2  ns is inferred , which is compatible with narrow time - window analysis in order to reduce the effect of photodetector dark count noise .",
    "third , light emitted is fully linearly polarized , which is perfectly suitable for polarization information encoding on the emitted single photons .",
    "we use an home - made scanning confocal microscope to select the single defects in the sample ( see ref.@xcite for a detailed description of the setup ) .",
    "the detection system includes a hanbury brown & twiss ( hbt ) setup with two silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) in single - photon counting regime ( spcm , perkin elmer ) on each side of a 50/50 non - polarizing beam splitter .",
    "it also integrates a spectrograph with a cooled ccd array for recording spectrum .",
    "we first raster scan the sample ( @xmath4  mm type iia natural bulk diamond wafer from element6 , the netherlands ) to identify well isolated photoluminescent emitters using a laser diode emitting at @xmath5 nm as cw excitation source .",
    "the laser beam is focused on the sample about @xmath6 @xmath7 m below its surface by a microscope objective ( @xmath8 , na@xmath9 ) which is also used for emitted light collection .",
    "the laser focus spot is about @xmath10 m fwhm .",
    "fig.[scan](a ) displays a @xmath11 @xmath7 m scan of the sample , showing photoluminescence from a single nickel - nitrogen related defect .",
    "the @xmath12-axis value indicates the count rate of one apd of the hbt setup . from the scan in fig.[scan](a ) , the observed signal to background ratio of the photoluminescence is as large as @xmath13 .",
    "counts / s .",
    "( b ) photoluminescence spectrum from the single emitter observed in fig.[scan](a ) with 10  s integration duration .",
    "the spectrum displayed has been corrected for the quantum efficiency of the ccd which varies from 85 to 53% in the 740840  nm range considered .",
    "the narrow peak ( 1 ) at 782  nm ( about 2  nm fwhm ) is the zero - phonon line of the nickel - nitrogen related defect  @xcite .",
    "the sharp peak ( 2 ) at 756  nm is related to the one - phonon raman scattering line of the diamond lattice with 1332  @xmath14 frequency shift .",
    "_ inset _ : zoom on the zero - phonon line , showing more clearly the intensity of the phonon wing.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the hbt setup is used to investigate the fluorescence intensity correlation function . thanks to the narrow spectral emission , a bandpass filter placed before the hbt setup allows us to select the photoluminescence from the defect while rejecting raman scattered light due to the diamond crystalline lattice .",
    "appropriate data processing of the photodetection events in the hbt configuration gives the histogram of the time separations between two consecutively detected photons .",
    "this delay function is equivalent to the second - order intensity autocorrelation function for short time scales  @xcite .",
    "evidence for single centre emission is given by the observation of antibunching  @xcite .",
    "this effect appears as a dip around @xmath15 in the recorded delay function ( see fig.[fig_g2_short](a ) ) , as the consequence of finite - time cycle of excitation - emission - reexcitation for a single dipole .    for each observed single emitter",
    ", we simultaneously record the spectrum of the emitted light on the spectrograph .",
    "fig.[scan](b ) shows the spectrum of the light collected from fig.1(a ) emitter .",
    "narrow emission peak at 782  nm is tentatively associated to a nickel - nitrogen related impurity in diamond  @xcite . from the spectrum , we infer that even at room temperature about 70% of the total intensity is concentrated in the zero - phonon line .",
    "this value is much higher than that of nitrogen - vacancy colour centre , for which it is only of the order of 1% .",
    "we also investigated the polarization properties of the single colour centre relative to absorption and emission of light .",
    "we have monitored the photoluminescence intensity while rotating the excitation laser linear polarization angle and obtained oscillations with a contrast of about 96% .",
    "this contrast value proves that the single colour centre behaves like a dipole relative to absorption of light . using the quarter wave plate method , we studied the emitted light polarization properties .",
    "we observed that the collected light is perfectly elliptically polarized with an aspect ratio of 0.25 .",
    "this measurement indicates that the single defect also behaves like an emitting dipole .",
    "the linear polarized light becomes elliptical after propagation though optics including high numerical aperture objective and dichroic mirror , both known for modifying the polarization state of light .",
    "in order to investigate photoluminescence dynamical processes , we model the response of the single colour center within the framework of a three - level system corresponding respectively to ground level ( 1 ) , excited level ( 2 ) , and metastable level ( 3 ) as shown in fig.[level_diag ] .",
    "the single colour centre is excited from its ground to excited level .",
    "it then either goes back to the ground level , or it non - radiatively decays to the metastable level , which presence is asserted by photon bunching in the intensity correlation measurement . from this `` dark '' level , the system finally goes back to the ground level by a phosphorescence process .",
    "the dynamics can be described by a set of rate equations on the populations @xmath16 of the three considered levels @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) denotes the transition rate from the level @xmath20 to level @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the transition rates @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively to and from the metastable level are small compared to the excited leve to the ground - level decay rate @xmath24 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can infer , for the normalized intensity correlation function @xmath25 the following analytical expression , valid for @xmath26 @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the steady - state population of the excited level ( 2 ) , and where @xmath29 denotes the population of level ( 2 ) at time @xmath30 , starting from level ( 1 ) at time @xmath31 . recalling that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are small compared to @xmath24",
    ", it follows that @xmath32 is much larger than @xmath33 .",

    "the normalization of the @xmath35 correlation function is inferred from the number of coincidences @xmath45 recorded during an integration period @xmath46 @xmath47 where the factor @xmath48 corresponds to the coincidence rate for an equivalent poissonian photon number distribution , associated with @xmath49 counts rates on each detector of the hbt setup and a time bin of width @xmath50 .",
    "note that this relation between @xmath45 and @xmath44 neglects any contribution from random background light emission , as we can assume from the high value of the signal - to - background ratio for the observed emitter shown in fig.[scan](a ) .",
    "the correlation function @xmath44 , and the associated measured number of coincidences are represented on fig.[fig_g2_short](a ) at short time scale .",
    "it shows a distinct minimum at zero delay , with a residual non - zero value caused by convolution with the instrumental response function ( irf ) of the detection setup .",
    "this function is independently measured to be a 1.2  ns fwhm gaussian function , by correlation of ti : sa laser 150-fs laser pulses .",
    "taking into account the irf time , the measured intensity correlation function at short time - scale can be well fitted by the convolution of the irf with the @xmath35 function given by eq.([g2_short ] ) for a single emitter .    by fitting the @xmath35 function curve at short time scale for different excitation powers ,",
    "we obtain the value of @xmath51 dependent on the excitation power ( fig.[fig_g2_short](b ) ) . at zero excitation power , @xmath51 is equal to the transition rate @xmath24 , which is by definition the invert of the excited - level lifetime . for the single emitter studied in fig.[scan](a ) , we get @xmath52 ns@xmath53 by extrapolating the linear fit to zero excitation power .",
    "excited - level lifetime is then calculated to be as short as 2  ns .",
    "absorption rate from the ground level is deduced from the excitation intensity dependance of @xmath51 , by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the absorption cross - section , @xmath56 the excitation intensity , and @xmath57 the excitation frequency . from @xmath32 at different excitation intensities ,",

    "the dashed line indicates the normalization level corresponding to poissonian photon - number statistics .",
    "note that the minimum value of @xmath35 at @xmath31 appears higher than in fig.[fig_g2_short](a ) due to choice of a larger timebin for histogram plot .",

    "intersystem crossing rates @xmath22 and @xmath23 are evaluated by fitting @xmath33 using eq.([lambda2 ] ) , together with @xmath66 and @xmath24 deduced from the short time - scale measurements .",
    "considering @xmath22 as a constant , we observe that the bunching effect depends on the laser power , indicating that 687  nm excitation light contributes to deshelving the metastable level . indeed ,",
