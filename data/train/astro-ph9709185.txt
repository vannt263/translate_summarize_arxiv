    "ez peg ( bd + 24@xmath7 4742 ) has a misleading history of confused interpretation of the origin and composition of the system .",
    "the spectrum of ez peg was originally classified by cannon as g5 ( schlesinger et al .",
    "vyssotsky & balz ( see alden 1958 ) claimed that the star varies from b0 to g5 , due to a spectrum taken in 1943 which appeared to be a b star spectrum . later howell & bopp ( 1985 ) presented evidence that this erroneous interpretation of the spectrum was due to poor resolution data .",
    "irvine ( 1972 ) proposed that ez peg was an u gem system ( a cataclysmic variable ) , but it is an unlikely explanation due to the normal uv emission of the system : in a color - color plot there is no strong uv excess typical of the dwarf novae and symbiotics ( szkody 1977 ) .",
    "furthermore linear polarimetry measurements of the system ( szkody et al .",
    "1982 ) show that ez peg does not seem to be a cataclysmic variable .",
    "howell & bopp ( 1985 ) observed the double - lined spectrum of ez peg and interpreted the color - indices ( b - v ) and ( u - b ) as that of a composite spectral type of g5 iv + k0 iv .",
    "they observed ca  ii h & k , h@xmath0 and h@xmath5 lines in emission , and they supposed that this emission originated in the cooler star , because it is the most typical case .",
    "howell et al .",
    "( 1986 ) suggested that both components of ez peg were subgiants , and pointed out a slightly asymmetric profile in h@xmath0 , interpreted as a vertical motion in the atmosphere of the active star of the system .",
    "griffin ( 1985 ) presented radial - velocity observations of the system , and he calculated the orbital elements . recently",
    "gunn et al . ( 1996 ) made cross - correlation radial velocity measurements of ez peg , showing a disagreement with the phases calculated from the ephemeris given by griffin ( 1985 ) .",
    "vilkki et al .",
    "( 1986 ) calculated a distance to ez peg of 83  pc using the trigonometric parallax method , and they suspected that ez peg belongs to the hyades cluster .",
    "barret ( 1996 ) calculated a distance of 82  pc using linear polarimetry .",
    "finally , recent studies in the ir band by mitrou et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with the iras satellite indicated that the system does not seem to present any circumstellar matter .    continuing with the series of multiwavelength optical observations of chromospherically active binaries ( montes et al .",
    "1997b , hereafter paper i ) , in this paper we present simultaneous observations in different optical wavelength bands , including also a high resolution echelle spectrum .",
    "all the data seem to point out that ez peg is a rs cvn system with an evolved g5 active star , and a k0v or iv non - active star .",
    "we have applied the spectral subtraction technique , observing the ca  ii h & k , h@xmath5 , h@xmath0 and ca ir triplet lines in emission , and a filling - in of the h@xmath1 line , proceeding from the hotter component of the system .    in sect .",

    "5 we present the conclusions .",
    "spectroscopic observations of ez peg in several optical chromospheric activity indicators have been obtained during two observing runs with the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) . in the first run ( september 13 - 15 1995 )",
    "we have obtained two spectra : in the h@xmath0 and na  i d@xmath2 , d@xmath3 , he  i d@xmath4 line regions , using grating h1800v , camera 500 and a 1024  x  1024 pixel tek3 ccd as detector .",
    "the reciprocal dispersion achieved is 0.24   / pixel which yields a spectral resolution of 0.48  @xmath8 and a useful wavelength range of 250  @xmath8 centered at 6563  @xmath8 ( h@xmath0 ) and 5876  @xmath8 ( hei d@xmath4 ) respectively . in the second run ( november 26 - 28 1996 ) we used the same configuration but two different gratings h1200r and h1200b , for the red and blue spectral regions respectively . using the same configuration a reciprocal dispersion of 0.39  @xmath8",
    "was obtained which yields a spectral resolution of 0.94  @xmath8 and a useful wavelength range of 385  @xmath8 centered at 6563  @xmath8 ( h@xmath0 ) , 5876  @xmath8 ( hei d@xmath4 ) , 4861  @xmath8 ( h@xmath1 ) , 3950  @xmath8 ( ca  ii h&k ) respectively .    in table",

    "we also analyse here echelle spectra obtained with the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) on july 31 1993 that we have retrieved from la palma data archive ( zuiderwijk et al .",
    "these wht / ues spectra were obtained with echelle 31 ( 31.6 grooves per mm ) and a 1280  x  1180 pixel eev6 ccd as detector .",
    "the central wavelength is 6127  @xmath8 and covers a wavelength range from 4845 to 8805  @xmath8 over 53 echelle orders .",
    "the achieved reciprocal dispersion ranges from 0.045 to 0.080   / pixel . in order to improve the s / n ratio and to avoid cosmic ray events , the final spectrum analysed here is the resulting from combine 28 ccd images with exposure times of 240  s each , obtaining a final spectrum with a s / n of 315 in the h@xmath0 line region . in table  [ tab : uesjul93 ] we give the wavelength range and the spectral lines of interest in each echelle order .",
    "in addition we also use one spectrum in the region of the ca  ii irt lines taken on january 16 1997 with the 1.0  m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) using the richardson - brealey spectrograph ( rbs ) with a grating of 1200 grooves per mm , and a 1024  x  1024 pixel tek4 ccd as detector .",
    "the reciprocal dispersion achieved is 0.85   / pixel which yields a spectral resolution of 1.7  @xmath8 and a useful wavelength range of 865  @xmath8 centered at 8765   .",
    "the spectra have been extracted using the standard reduction procedures in the iraf package ( bias subtraction , flat - field division , and optimal extraction of the spectra ) .",
    "the reduction of the jkt / rbs spectrum was carried out using the reduction package  ( cardiel & gorgas 1997 , see also http://www.ucm.es/otros/astrof/reduceme/reduceme.html ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration was obtained by taking spectra of a cu - ar lamp in the int / ids spectra , a th - ar lamp in the wht / ues spectrum and a cu - ne lamp in the jkt / rbs spectrum .",

    "these results suggest a clear difference in luminosity class between the two components of the system , being the g5 primary star more evolved than a subgiant , meanwhile the k0 star is probably a luminosity class v star .    as is explained in the following section all the activity indicators analysed here",
    "show that the hot component is the active star of the system , contrary to the usual behaviour observed in chromospherically active binaries . only in some by dra stars the hot component tends to be the most active star of the system or even the only active component ( montes et al .",
    "so we have used our ca  ii k spectra to determine the absolute visual magnitude , m@xmath20 of the active component by the application of the wilson - bappu effect ( wilson & bappu 1957 ) . the mean emission line width measured in our ca  ii",

    "this result indicates that the active component of ez peg may be of luminosity class iv or higher .    the difference in luminosity class between the hot and cool components that our spectra indicate could explain why the hot component is the active star ( see below ) ,",
    "since if the hot component is a more evolved star it could have developed a deep convective zone and therefore , according to the dynamo mechanism , should present a higher activity level . anyway",
    "the cooler k0v component could also be active and present a faint emission in the h & k lines , but due to the small contribution of that star to the combined spectrum of the system , this emission is very difficult to be observed .",

    "we have corrected the total ew measured , ew(li  i+fe  i)=50.4 ( m ) from the relative contribution to the continuum ( 0.65 ) .",
    "then the contribution from the blend with the fe  i @xmath6 6704.41 line must be subtracted .",

    "it is noticeable the change in the wings of the h@xmath0 line from the 1st to the 2nd night of the 1996 run , the two gaussian components fit reveals that the contribution of the broad component changes from 53.2% to 39.7% ( see fig  [ fig : int96 ha ] ) .",
