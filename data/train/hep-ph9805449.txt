    "<S> the properties of the pq mechanism should therefore depend on details of the susy breakdown . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to propose a simple model which works as the pq mechanism in the framework of gauge - mediated susy breaking , while most of the previous study has been done in gravity - mediated susy breaking .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath5 is the pq scalar field , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are pq squarks . and @xmath20 . ]    from the potential ( [ v - cl ] ) one finds a flat direction along the @xmath5 axis with @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this comes from the fact that the superpotential ( [ sp - pq ] ) has an extended u(1@xmath3 symmetry @xcite . because it is a holomorphic function , the superpotential which possesses the conventional u(1@xmath3 symmetry is also invariant under the complex form of the u(1 ) transformation ( i.e. the dilatational transformation ) . </S>",
    "<S> this extended symmetry results in the flat direction of the scalar potential ( [ v - cl ] ) when the susy is an exact symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , the flat direction is lifted through susy breaking effects .    in gauge - mediated susy breaking theories ( for a review see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , the standard model ( sm ) gauge interaction transmits susy breaking effects from a messenger sector to ordinary squarks and sleptons at two - loop level . at the same level </S>",
    "<S> the pq squarks @xmath18 and @xmath19 also feel susy breaking through the qcd interaction , whereas the pq scalar @xmath5 is a gauge singlet and thus feels susy breaking through the yukawa interaction ( [ sp - pq ] ) only after the pq squarks receive susy breaking masses . </S>",
    "<S> then the induced potential for @xmath5 is so suppressed that we should not neglect the susy breaking effect mediated by gravity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed as we will see shortly , the balance between the gravity - mediated effect and the gauge - mediated effect determines the minimum of the @xmath5 field . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the potential of the flat direction induced by the susy breaking effects by considering the both mediation mechanisms .    </S>",
    "<S> effects of susy breaking communicated by the gravity are expected to induce the soft susy breaking mass to the pq scalar field comparable to the gravitino mass @xmath22 which is much smaller than the electroweak scale in the gauge - mediated susy breaking models ( @xmath23 kev1 gev ) . then through the gravity - mediation the flat direction obtains the potential @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a dimension - less parameter of the order one , which we assume to be positive . </S>",
    "<S> we have neglected higher order terms because they are suppressed by the gravitational scale .    on the other hand , effects of susy breaking through the gauge - mediation mechanism also generate a potential @xmath27 to the pq @xmath5 field . in most models of the gauge - mediation@xcite susy is broken by some non - perturbative dynamics in a `` _ hidden _ '' sector and its effects are fed down to a messenger sector . in the messenger sector , a gauge - singlet chiral multiplet @xmath28 is supposed to have a @xmath29-component vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath30 and a @xmath31-component vev @xmath32 as well . </S>",
    "<S> this singlet couples to messenger quark multiplets @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are @xmath35 and @xmath36 in su(3)@xmath9 , in the superpotential @xmath37 with @xmath38 a dimension - less coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential ( [ sp - m ] ) induces a mass of the messenger quark @xmath39 as @xmath40 and the messenger squarks @xmath41 obtain masses squared as @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> here we define @xmath43 and @xmath44 by @xmath45 then the susy is broken in the messenger sector and its effects are mediated to the ordinary sector through the sm gauge interaction by integrating out the heavy messenger fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the pq squarks @xmath18 and @xmath19 , similar to the squarks in the standard model sector , obtain soft susy breaking masses from two - loop diagrams of the messenger multiplets , gluon and gluino . </S>",
    "<S> then the susy breaking effects are transmitted to the pq @xmath5 field by `` one - loop '' diagrams of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> we made an explicit calculation of the effective potential for the pq scalar @xmath5 , @xmath46 , along the flat direction induced by the above gauge - mediation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> here we present only the final result and the details are found in appendix . to estimate the minimum of the potential , the derivative of the potential with respect to @xmath47 is sufficient rather than @xmath27 itself . </S>",
    "<S> the result is given by here should be understood as its modulus @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we use this notation to avoid unnecessary complications . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 here we have presented the asymptotic form which is valid only for @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because for @xmath51 , the gauge - mediation generates a sizable negative curvature for the @xmath5 field in a standard manner , which shifts the vev of the field far away from the origin . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect that the minimum of @xmath5 is much larger than @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a good news for phenomenology because there is some chance that the resulting pq scale falls into the cosmological axion window , which is indeed the case , as we will see shortly .    the potential along the flat direction @xmath5 generated by the two susy breaking effects is thus given by @xmath52 using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ v_h ] ) and ( [ v_g ] ) we can estimate the vev of the pq scalar field , @xmath53 , by looking into the minimization condition of the potential @xmath54 which yields @xmath55    the pq scalar field thus develops a vev , and the u(1)@xmath4 symmetry is spontaneously broken and the pq scale is given as @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize that in the present axion model the pq scale is determined by only the susy breaking scales without introducing any other mass scales . </S>",
    "<S> we present the numerical values of the pq scale in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> if we take the parameters of the messenger sector as @xmath44 = 40 tev and @xmath43 = 50 tev the pq scale is approximately given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 = 1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this model provides a simple description of the pq mechanism in the gauge - mediated susy breaking theories . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the simplest structure of the messenger sector , our choice of @xmath44 yields the right - handed slepton mass of about 90 gev . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the choice of @xmath43 is somewhat arbitrary , though @xmath43 must be larger than @xmath44 to avoid a negative mass squared for the messenger squark , and thus one should regard ( [ eq : pqscale ] ) as the lower bound of the pq scale for a given gravitino mass . </S>",
    "<S> one should keep this point in mind , though in the following we take @xmath59 tev for our representative value .    in susy theories , </S>",
    "<S> the axion forms a chiral multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the axion , which can be chosen as the imaginary part of the complex scalar @xmath5 , the multiplet contains a saxion @xmath60 , the real part of @xmath5 , and an axino @xmath61 , the fermionic component of the multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> parameterizing @xmath5 = @xmath62 the mass of the saxion is easily evaluated as @xmath63 thus the saxion acquires a mass comparable to the gravitino , while the axion @xmath64 gets a mass from the qcd effect as @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall next consider cosmology of this axion model to see whether or not it is cosmologically viable . </S>",
    "<S> the axion relic abundance from the misalignment is given as @xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the initial misalignment angle ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 the hubble constant in units of 100 km / sec./mpc . </S>",
    "<S> in ignorance of the misalignment angle and with theoretical uncertainty of order unity in the evaluation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : axion - abundance ] ) , we could say that the axion may be able to constitute the dominant component of the dark matter of the universe if @xmath70 the same argument implies an upper bound of the axion scale @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the cooling of the sn 1987a puts a lower bound of about @xmath72 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the following range @xmath73 is regarded as the allowed region of the pq scale . with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pqscale ] ) , this in turn identifies the allowed range of the gravitino mass in this scenario : @xmath74 remarkably the gauge - mediated susy breaking naturally gives the gravitino mass in this range . </S>",
    "<S> the region of @xmath22 is somewhat shifted if we take a different value of @xmath43 , but still the gravitino mass range fits with the gauge - mediation mechanism as far as @xmath75 gev with @xmath76 gev fixed . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this model does not give the possible hadronic axion window @xmath77 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> let us next consider cosmology of the saxion . </S>",
    "<S> it dominantly decays to two axions through the interaction given by @xmath78 the decay width is estimated as @xmath79 from which we find the lifetime @xmath80 it varies widely from @xmath81@xmath82 sec . </S>",
    "<S> for the gravitino mass range ( [ eq : gravitino - mass - range ] ) . with this long lifetime , we have to see its cosmological consequences carefully .    </S>",
    "<S> to go further , we need to estimate the saxion abundance . </S>",
    "<S> the saxion decouples from the thermal bath at the temperature about @xcite @xmath83 if the decoupling temperature were lower than the reheat temperature after the inflation , then the yield of the saxion ( defined by the number density of the saxion divided by the entropy density ) would be @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> however the gravitino problem in the gmsb suggests relatively low @xmath85 . for the gravitino mass range considered here , the closure limit of the gravitino </S>",
    "<S> gives @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the gluino mass . </S>",
    "<S> so the decoupling temperature is higher than the reheat temperature , and saxions are not thermalized . </S>",
    "<S> is closed to its lower bound @xmath88 gev the decoupling temperature can be larger than the reheat temperature . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent argument in the text does not apply for this case . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the abundance of the saxion simply becomes @xmath89 gev @xmath90 mev ) instead of ( [ eq : saxion - abundance - thermal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered cosmology of the saxion in this exceptional case separately and checked that this survives cosmological constraints described below . </S>",
    "<S> ] however saxions are produced by scattering _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ @xmath91 in the thermal bath , with the yield @xcite @xmath92 and thus @xmath93    the saxion is also produced as its coherent oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> an inspection shows that with the low reheat temperature given by ( [ eq : tr - gravitino ] ) the saxion starts to oscillate while the inflaton obeys coherent oscillation ( before the reheating process is completed ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the abundance to be @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the initial amplitude of the saxion oscillation , which is expected to be of order @xmath0 .    in the above </S>",
    "<S> , we have assumed that the vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath5 is displaced from the origin during the reheating process : otherwise thermal effects would generate a positive mass for @xmath5 , trapping the @xmath5 field at the origin until the universe cools down below the weak scale . in this case , the above estimate is no longer valid , and we expect that the relic abundance of the saxion will be much larger , which may be problematic . the displacement of the field @xmath5 may be achieved by fluctuations of the field during the de sitter expansion in the inflationary phase . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we use the maximum of ( [ eq : saxion - abundance - thermal ] ) and ( [ eq : saxion - abundance - osc ] ) as the saxion abundance . </S>",
    "<S> it remains constant as time goes on as far as no entropy production occurs . </S>",
    "<S> note that the abundance is proportional to the reheat temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> let us next consider bounds on the abundance of the saxions and the axions produced by the saxion decay . </S>",
    "<S> existence of exotic particles around the cosmic temperature @xmath96 mev may accelerate the expansion of the universe and increase the neutron - to - proton number ratio at the decoupling , resulting in too much @xmath97he abundance . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , the abundance of such exotic particles should not exceed that of one neutrino species , namely @xmath98 this is not significant .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy densities of the saxions and the produced axions may alter the evolution of the universe at much later time , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ the age of the universe and the time of matter - radiation equality . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the abundance of the produced saxions does not exceed the critical density of the universe ( divided by the present entropy density ) , namely @xmath99 then the standard cosmology is not affected . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the condition ( [ eq : saxion - abundance - safe ] ) is easily satisfied for a certain range of the reheat temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the next bounds we consider are those from rare decay modes of the saxion . since the saxion is light , it does not decay to gluons . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it generally decays to photons . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio of the radiative decay of the saxion , @xmath100 , is typically of the order @xmath101 . for @xmath102 sec . </S>",
    "<S> the constraint on the radiative decay comes from the photodissociation of the light elements ( for a recent analysis , see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . for @xmath103 sec . , the non - observation of the distortion of the cosmic microwave background gives a tighter bound on the abundance of the produced photons : @xmath104 gev @xmath105sec.@xmath106 for @xmath107@xmath108 sec . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath109 gev @xmath110sec.@xmath111 for @xmath112@xmath113 sec . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . comparing the above bounds with the predicted abundance ( [ eq : saxion - abundance - thermal ] ) or ( [ eq : saxion - abundance - osc ] ) multiplied by the very small branching ratio @xmath100 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the saxion abundance easily survives these bounds even with relatively a high reheat temperature close to the upper bound allowed by the gravitino problem . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , when the saxion decays after the recombination ( @xmath114 gev ) , a stringent constraint comes from the diffuse x - ray backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest one is @xmath115 gev for @xmath116 sec . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this severe constraint is fulfilled if the reheat temperature is lower than 10 gev so that the saxion abundance is highly suppressed .    summarizing the above arguments , we conclude that our model can be viable in view of the saxion cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy to mention that the case where the saxion abundance exceeds ( [ eq : saxion - abundance - safe ] ) is not immediately ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> rather the saxion may modify the universe s evolution in an interesting way . </S>",
    "<S> probably the most interesting case @xcite is that the saxion energy density once dominates the universe before it decays to axions . </S>",
    "<S> then the produced axions behave as an extra contribution to the radiation when we consider the cosmological developments , which delay the epoch of the matter - radiation equality . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the saxion may play a role of the late decaying particle which will reconcile the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe for @xmath117 with the large scale structure formation , if the following is fulfilled @xcite @xmath118 in particular , our model provides a concrete realization of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a hypothetically light saxion is proposed to play this role .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we will look into the axino , the fermionic superpartner of the axion . </S>",
    "<S> radiative corrections with the messenger fields give an axino mass . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution appears at the three - loop level , and it is @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> the axino mass is also induced by supergravity effects and in general it becomes of the order of the gravitino mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an inspection shows that , however , in this simple model , the leading contribution of the order @xmath22 is cancelled , and the non - vanishing contribution is @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the axino is much lighter than the gravitino . </S>",
    "<S> the axinos are produced by scattering after the inflationary epoch and we expect that the yield of the axinos is more or less the same as that of the saxions ( [ eq : saxion - yield ] ) . in our case , since the axino is much lighter than the saxion , the axino energy density is always smaller than the saxion s one and thus it is harmless . </S>",
    "<S> another possible worry is that the gravitino decay to an axino and an axion is kinematically allowed . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the mass range of the gravitino considered here , the lifetime is much longer than the age of the universe , hence the gravitino is essentially stable . </S>",
    "<S> thus the light axino appeared in this model does not alter the argument above and it is cosmologically harmless .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we proposed the hadronic axion model in the gauge - mediated susy breaking theories . </S>",
    "<S> the model gives a simple description on the pq symmetry breaking mechanism which is solely governed by the susy breaking physics . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the pq scale is inversely scaled to the gravitino mass and the resulting pq scale naturally falls into the axion window , for the gravitino mass range favored by the gauge - mediation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the axion becomes a dark matter candidate for @xmath121 kev1 mev . </S>",
    "<S> next we investigated cosmological implications of the other particles in the axion supermultiplet , namely the saxion and the axino , and showed that our model is cosmologically acceptable with sufficiently low reheat temperature which is suggested by the gravitino problem . </S>",
    "<S> finally we pointed out that the saxion in this model may play a role of the late - decaying particle , causing the delay of the matter - radiation equality , and consequently reconciling the standard cdm with the structure formations of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> details of this issue will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . </S>"
