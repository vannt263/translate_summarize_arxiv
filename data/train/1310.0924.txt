    "monge s optimal transportation problem consists of relocating a certain amount of mass from its original distribution to a different target distribution minimizing the transportation cost . in more abstract terms , the problem consists of finding a transportation map @xmath11 such that @xmath12 here , and throughout the paper , we assume @xmath13 . remarkably , under some smoothness assumptions , monge s problem is intimately related to the @xmath14-wasserstein distance by @xmath15 where the @xmath14-wasserstein distance between @xmath6 , @xmath7 is defined as @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the set of probability measures on @xmath18 with marginals @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". this functional is related to very important problems in mathematics , the study of which has led to deep developments in several fields of research and applications , linked to such important names as ampre , kantorovich , rubinstein , zolotarev and dobrushin , among others . to avoid a huge number of references , we refer to the books by rachev and rschendorf  @xcite and by villani  @xcite , for an updated account of the interest and implications of the problem . however , we emphasize the importance of the topic in the development of the theory of probability metrics and its implications in statistics , particularly in goodness of fit problems . focusing on such kind of problems , the functional of interest is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the empirical measure associated to a sample @xmath21 , of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random vectors with law @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is any target probability measure on @xmath5 , or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands for the empirical measure on a second , independent i.i.d .",
    "random sample , @xmath24 .",
    "these empirical versions are connected to a combinatorial optimization problem , namely the _ optimal matching _ problem .",
    "in fact , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 ranges over the permutations of the set @xmath28 .",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to analyzing the rate and mode of convergence of ( [ transportfunctional ] ) and several variants of it , beginning with the seminal paper by ajtai , komlos and tusnady  @xcite in the case in which both samples come from the same underlying probability law @xmath6 .",
    "the problem can be equivalently formulated in terms of @xmath29 , the distance between the empirical and true distributions .",
    "further references will be provided later , but now let us mention the series of papers authored by talagrand  @xcite , talagrand and yukich  @xcite and dobri and yukich  @xcite , which in the case when @xmath6 is the uniform distribution on the @xmath0-dimensional unit cube , @xmath1^d$ ] , essentially shows that @xmath30    this paper deals with the empirical cost of optimal _ incomplete _ or _ partial _ transportation .",
    "this is the case in which the amount of mass required in the target distribution is smaller than that in the original one .",
    "then , we do not have to move all the original mass , but we can dismiss a fraction of it . of course , we would like to complete this task with a minimal cost .",
    "a more general version is possible if we admit that we only have to fulfill a fraction of the target distribution .",
    "the general formulation of this problem , with quadratic cost , has been introduced by caffarelli and mccann  @xcite , relating it to a monge  ampre double obstacle problem .",
    "they obtain remarkable results on the existence , uniqueness and regularity of the optimal solutions in a well - separated situation .",
    "figalli  @xcite improved the results covering the case of nondisjoint supports for the involved probability measures . independently , lvarez - esteban et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the problem in the context of similarity of probabilities , obtaining a more general result of existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution .",
    "moreover  @xcite includes almost sure consistency of sample solutions to the true ones . in a subsequent paper , lvarez - esteban et al .",
    "@xcite noticed the faster rate of decay of the cost of empirical incomplete transportation ( in the @xmath31 case ) and introduced a procedure for testing similarity of probabilities based on this fact .",
    "a convenient mathematical formulation of this optimal incomplete transportation problem can be done with the help of the concept of _ trimmings _ of a probability .",
    "[ definition1 ] given @xmath32 and borel probability measures @xmath6 , @xmath33 on  @xmath5 , we say that @xmath33 is an @xmath34-trimming of @xmath6 if @xmath33 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath6 , and the radon  nikodym derivative satisfies @xmath35 .",
    "the set of all @xmath34-trimmings of @xmath6 will be denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "note that in the extreme case @xmath37 , @xmath38 is just @xmath6 , while @xmath39 is the set of all probability measures absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "see  @xcite for useful alternative characterizations of trimmings of a probability , as well as mathematical properties of the set @xmath36 .",
    "turning back to the partial mass transportation problem , we could represent the target distribution by the probability @xmath7 and the initial distribution of mass by @xmath40 , @xmath6 being another probability if the mass required in the target distribution is @xmath41 times the mass in the original locations .",
    "an incomplete transportation plan is then a probability measure @xmath42 on @xmath43 with second marginal equal to @xmath7 and first marginal in @xmath44 , and the cost of optimal incomplete transportation is @xmath45 in the more general case , with slackness in the target distribution , the optimal incomplete transportation cost would be @xmath46 , the minimal @xmath47 distance between trimmings of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this paper gives exact rates of convergence for empirical versions of the optimal incomplete transportation cost . as with classical optimal transportation , the results can be considered in terms of a combinatorial optimization problem , that we call _ optimal incomplete matching_. to be precise , assume that we can trim ( eliminate ) a fixed proportion @xmath34 of @xmath48 s points and also of @xmath49 s points , and we should only search for the best matching between the nontrimmed samples . taking for simplicity @xmath50 to be an integer ,",
    "the new functional of interest is @xmath51 where @xmath27 varies in the set of permutations of @xmath52 , @xmath53 ranges in the subsets of size @xmath54 of @xmath55 , and similarly @xmath56 ranges in the subsets of size @xmath54 of @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath58 in fact , @xmath59 equals the minimum [ in @xmath60 of the linear function @xmath61 subject to the linear constraints @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 [ we are assuming @xmath66 . rescaling we see that @xmath67 equals the minimum [ in @xmath68 of the linear function @xmath69 subject to the linear constraints @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the constraint matrix in this last linear program is totally unimodular ( see , e.g. , theorem 13.3 in @xcite ) and the right - hand side is integer .",
    "hence , the minimum is attained at some integer solution , that is , satisfying @xmath76 , and this implies ( [ partialmatching ] ) .",
    "we will show the somewhat unexpected result that , independently of the value of @xmath77 , the rates in ( [ untrimmed ] ) change to @xmath78 for _ any _ dimension @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , ( [ trimmed ] ) follows from the triangle inequality and @xmath80 which is the formulation we choose for the results we prove .",
    "our approach relies only on elementary or rather classical tools .",
    "in particular , we do not use subadditivity arguments as in  @xcite .",
    "subadditivity yields a.s .",
    "convergence to a constant , rather than just a rate of convergence . on the other hand ,",
    "the approach in  @xcite relies on showing subadditivity of a certain poissonization of the matching functional ( subadditivity does not hold for the original matching functional ; see remark  1.1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "we could also use that approach here , at least for @xmath81 ( otherwise duality for optimal matching , which is essential in the cited approach , becomes harder to deal with ) but the approximation rate for the poissonization of the incomplete matching functional would not allow us to recover the present result in dimension @xmath82 .    the study of the rate of convergence of @xmath83 for @xmath77 , for some probability metrics @xmath84 was started in del barrio and matrn @xcite . in the case of the wasserstein metric and dimension @xmath85 , the results in  @xcite already show a very different behavior with respect to the untrimmed case , namely @xmath86    we close this mentioning the connection of empirical optimal incomplete tranportation to another important problem in probability , that of _",
    "random quantization_. taking @xmath87 ( full trimming ) we have that @xmath88 is the set of all probability measures concentrated on the sample points , and @xmath89 is the minimal @xmath14-cost of relocating a mass distributed according to some probability measure @xmath6 to a collection of randomly chosen spots @xmath21 . when @xmath21 are @xmath5-valued i.i.d . random vectors and",
    "@xmath6 is absolutely continuous , the problem can be formulated , in monge s way , as the minimization of @xmath90 where @xmath91 varies in the set of all measurable functions with values in @xmath92 .",
    "since , for a fixed @xmath93 in the integrand in ( [ equacion1 ] ) , the distance @xmath94 is minimized for @xmath95 , without any constraint on the capacity to be stored at @xmath96 , we obtain that the optimal @xmath91 is given by this last expression , and hence the optimal cost equals @xmath97 random quantization is a well - studied problem ; see , for example , the graf and luschgy monograph @xcite or the more recent paper by yukich  @xcite . in particular , the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath14 quantization error is known , hence the rate at which @xmath98 vanishes .",
    "a trivial consequence of definition  [ definition1 ] is that @xmath99 if @xmath100 .",
    "this implies @xmath101 hence rates of convergence for the random quantization error are a lower bound for rates of convergence of @xmath102 for general @xmath34 . in a first look , classical optimal transportation is a _ global _",
    "problem while random quantization is a _ local _ one : a point @xmath93 is mapped through the optimal map @xmath91 to a sample point which in the case of random quantization , is determined just by sample points which are close to @xmath93 ( the nearest neighbor in fact ) while in the case of optimal transportation , two samples with the same sample points in a neighborhood of @xmath93 may result , however , in very different destinations for @xmath93 due to capacity constraints .",
    "it turns out though , that this different character is only apparent , in terms of rates , in dimensions @xmath85 or  @xmath103 .",
    "the most relevant fact which we show in this paper is that , again in terms of rates , optimal incomplete transportation shows the same _ local _ nature as random quantization in _ any _ dimension .",
