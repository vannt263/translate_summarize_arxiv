    "<S> non - equilibrium diffusive systems are known to exhibit long - range correlations , which decay like the inverse @xmath0 of the system size @xmath1 in one dimension . here , </S>",
    "<S> taking the example of the @xmath2 model , we show that this size dependence becomes anomalous ( the decay becomes a non - integer power of @xmath1 ) when the diffusive system approaches a second - order phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> this power - law decay as well as the @xmath1-dependence of the time - time correlations can be understood in terms of the dynamics of the amplitude of the first fourier mode of the particle densities . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude evolves according to a langevin equation in a quartic potential ,    which was introduced in a previous work to explain the anomalous behavior of the cumulants of the current near this second - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> here we also compute some of the cumulants away from the transition and show that they become singular as the transition is approached . </S>"
