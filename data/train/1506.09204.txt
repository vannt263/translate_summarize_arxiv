    "the study of topological insulators have become a ubiquitous study in condensed matter physics .",
    "these materials have captivated considerable attention of researchers @xcite .",
    "they involve materials such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 or bi@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "one of the special properties of these materials is that they have an electronic bulk structure with a finite gap separating the conduction band from the valence band , but their edges ( for two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis ) or surfaces ( for 3d tis ) , however , have gapless states , which are protected by trs .",
    "provided that the system remains time - reversal invariant , these gapless states are robust .",
    "the bulk hamiltonian near the energy gap closing points ( dirac points ) replicates a 2d dirac hamiltonian , which describes the surface states .",
    "interesting electronic transport properties emerge when trs is explicitly broken .",
    "there are different ways to induce an explicit trs breaking interactions .",
    "they can be induced by applying a perpendicular magnetic field or by depositing a ferromagnet on the surface of a ti .",
    "these trs breaking interactions lift the degeneracy of the dirac points and introduce a finite gap on the surface of a ti .",
    "the upshot is that one observes interesting electronic transport , which include a half quantized conductivity , majorana bound states , etc.@xcite .",
    "however , the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phase @xcite is obtained by preserving trs by the inclusion of an intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "this phase is reminiscent of two copies of quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) phases , where each copy breaks trs and the total system remains time - reversal invariant .",
    "it has been shown that qsh effect can persist even when trs is explicitly broken @xcite .",
    "these interesting observations have paved the way for numerous investigations and the fates of qsh effect in complicated systems . in the qsh phase , there are two pairs of gapless edge state modes counter - propagating in the vicinity of the bulk gap , which can be captured in the tight binding limit of the low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "the importance of tight binding model in topological insulators was first elucidated by bernevig , hughes , and zhang bhz @xcite on a square lattice .",
    "following the same line of study , huichao li _",
    "@xcite coined an alternative tight binding model for ti thin film on a square lattice . in recent years",
    ", topological insulators have also been investigated on a honeycomb lattice , @xcite , kagome lattice @xcite lieb and perovskite lattices @xcite , and pyrochlore lattice @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to provide another lattice geometry in which the physics of qsh effect and topological quantum phase transition are manifested .",
    "we investigate a tight binding model on the porphyrin lattice @xcite , in which trs breaking through the zeeman effect requires the nearest neighbour sites to have a complex amplitude , reminiscent of the haldane model @xcite ; see fig .  .",
    "by incorporating an additional phase ( gauge ) into the complex amplitudes we show that in a special limit and with a specific gauge choice , the pristine model reduces to a time - reversal invariant hamiltonian , which in turn reduces to the usual ti thin film model in the continuum limit .",
    "we also show that this model possesses different chern numbers in different regimes of the parameter space just like in real systems .",
    "we further explore this model by incorporating spin degrees of freedom and explicit trs breaking couplings , such as an off - diagonal coupling ( electrostatic potential ) , @xmath2 , a magnetic field , @xmath3 , and a rashba soc , @xmath4 .",
    "we explicitly map out different phase diagrams at the gap closing points .",
    "lattice regularizations of the low - energy hamiltonian is an expedient way for studying the topological properties and the edge states of a ti in the entire brillouin zone . in this paper",
    ", we study the tight binding model of porphyrin thin films .",

    "the motivation for the phase factor ( gauge ) @xmath23 is rather technical .",
    "it does not , however , change the complex nature of the hopping amplitudes .",
    "in particular , the total phase in a unit cell vanishes , reminiscent of the haldane model .",
