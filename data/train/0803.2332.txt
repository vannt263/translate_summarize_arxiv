    "magnets with geometrical frustration@xcite have received much attention as models of strongly interacting electronic systems with unusual ground states , thermodynamic phases , and excitations .",
    "the hallmark of strong frustration is a conspicuously large degeneracy of the classical ground state : essentially , a finite _ fraction _ of the degrees of freedom remains unconstrained to the lowest temperatures . for discrete spins ,",
    "this manifests itself in the number of ground states scaling exponentially with the system volume and thus giving rise to a nonzero entropy density at absolute zero temperature .",
    "well - known examples of that are the ising antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice@xcite and spin ice.@xcite for continuous spins  most saliently for the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice  the classical ground states form a _ manifold _",
    "whose dimension is proportional to the system volume.@xcite in that particular case , the classical model exhibits strong short - range spin correlations but fails to exhibit any form of conventional magnetic order down to the lowest temperatures accessible in monte carlo simulations . the strong correlation between the local motions of spins in this liquid - like phase manifests itself as an emergent gauge structure in the low - temperature limit and results in a dipolar form of the asymptotic spin correlations at large separations .",
    "@xcite    at the same time , the large degeneracy of the ground state makes this system susceptible to all kinds of perturbations , which certainly exist in real compounds .",
    "for instance , the spin - lattice coupling , arising from the dependence of exchange strength on the atomic displacements,@xcite lifts the degeneracy through a spin analog of the jahn - teller effect@xcite observed in spinels zncr@xmath4o@xmath5@xcite and cdcr@xmath4o@xmath5.@xcite     and @xmath6 are inequivalent , the two couplings may be different .",

    "this naturally leads one to ponder the following questions .",
    "can the interplay of a weak perturbation with strong frustration lead to interesting ordered phases ?",
    "are there any ( intermediate ) partially ordered phases ? what is the nature of the phase transitions between such phases ? in this paper we discuss these questions in the context of a classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice with interactions going beyond nearest neighbors . following previous work by reimers _ _ et al.__@xcite and by tsuneishi _",
    "et al._,@xcite we consider the classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice with the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate pairs of first and second neighbors , respectively .",
    "given the short - range nature of exchange forces , we work in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the influence of @xmath0 becomes noticeable only at low temperatures of order @xmath11 , when the system is already in the strongly correlated paramagnetic state , in which it is constrained to fluctuate around the ground states of the nearest neighbor exchange . using a combination of monte carlo simulations and analytical arguments ,",

    "the transition between the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases is discontinuous .",
    "ferromagnetic second - neighbor exchange , @xmath15 , leaves the system strongly frustrated .",
    "a mean - field calculation by reimers _ _ et al.__@xcite predicted a ground state with incommensurate magnetic order . while tsuneishi _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite indeed observed bragg peaks in the spin structure factor obtained through a monte carlo simulation for @xmath16 , they also noted that the spins remained dynamic , failing to freeze .",
    "we show that the observed locations of the bragg peaks are compatible with the results of reimers _ et al .",
    "_ , so that the low - temperature phase is most likely magnetically ordered .",
    "the main focus of our paper is a peculiar _ partially ordered _ phase sandwiched between the paramagnet and the magnetically ordered state for weak enough ferromagnetic @xmath0 , namely @xmath17 . in the intermediate phase , the spins display collinear order ; furthermore , they exhibit magnetic order within a thin @xmath18 layer but no order across different layers .",
    "the partial order can be characterized by a combination of a director @xmath19 specifying a global spin axis , a potts ( @xmath20 ) variable @xmath21 , ( 010 ) , or ( 001 ) specifying the direction of the layers , and an ising ( @xmath22 ) variable @xmath23 _ for each layer _ identifying one of the two possible spin orientations within a layer .",
    "the order is partial in the sense that the ising variables @xmath24 randomly pick values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 with no discernible correlations between adjacent layers .",
    "the partially ordered state is bounded by first - order transitions on both the high and low - temperature sides .",
    "similar partial order has been previously found in a @xmath27 treatment of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the checkerboard lattice , also known as the square lattice with crossings , a two - dimensional analog of the pyrochlore.@xcite in both systems , the distinct layered states are _ not _ related to one another by a symmetry of the hamiltonian and simply arise as different local minima of the free energy .",
    "free - energy barriers separating them may be large enough in practice for the system not to be ergodic and instead to remain in one of these minima forever .",
    "since the energy of the partially ordered collinear state is greater than that of the low - temperature multiple-@xmath28 magnetic order , entropic selection plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the intermediate phase .",
    "this is consistent with the general observation that states with collinear spins tend to have softer thermal fluctuations and therefore have a lower free energy at finite temperatures.@xcite a similar collinear phase has been reported in the monte carlo study of a @xmath29-@xmath30 model which interpolates between the pyrochlore and the fcc lattices .",
    "@xcite    while we have focused on the role of second - neighbor exchange @xmath0 in the formation of magnetic order on the pyrochlore lattice , our results also shed light on the role of third - neighbor interactions @xmath31 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pyrochlore ] ) . in view of strong correlations between nearest - neighbor spins developing at temperatures well below @xmath32 ,",
    "the properties of the system depend not on @xmath0 and @xmath31 separately but on their linear combination @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , the relative shift in energy for any pair of ground states of the nearest - neighbor exchange due to a small @xmath31 is identical to the effect of a @xmath0 of the same magnitude and opposite sign .",
    "thus our findings should also be of relevance for the more general case of a pyrochlore antiferromagnet with small @xmath0 and @xmath31 .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "since the phase transitions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - dgm ] are strongly discontinuous and occur at very low temperatures , the metastable states close to the coexisting region are rather long - lived .",
    "conventional histogram methods with local metropolis updates are ineffective in determining the critical points due to a large energy barrier separating the metastable state from the true ground state .",
    "instead , we settled on using a method proposed by m. creutz _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite in which a mixed phase with the two coexisting states each occupying half the lattice is constructed first . by thermalizing the mixed phase at various temperatures , the critical point is determined when neither of the two states prevail the system during the relaxation process .",
    "since the multiple-@xmath28 magnetic order has an extended unit cell with a period of about 4 cubic lattice constants , systems used in our mixed - phase simulations contain @xmath34 cubic unit cells , with a total spin @xmath35 .      in the limit @xmath36 , magnetic ordering takes place at a temperature @xmath37 . the nature of this ordering is best understood by appealing to the fact that a weak third - neighbor coupling @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pyrochlore ] ) selects among the nearest - neighbour ground states in the same way as a second - neighbor coupling @xmath0 of the same strength and opposite sign , as explained in appendix [ app : equiv ] .",
    "( we here note in passing that , since the strength of coupling depends on the exchange paths and not the interatomic distance alone , sometimes @xmath31 may be as big as @xmath0 .",
