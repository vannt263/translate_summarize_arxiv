    "the current standard cosmology model relies on the existence of two unknown dark components , the so called `` dark matter '' ( dm ) and `` dark energy '' ( de ) , which amount to @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the total energy budget in the universe , respectively . according to several observations ,",
    "the universe is spatially flat and in an accelerated phase of its expansion @xcite . de , described as a cosmological constant @xmath4 in its simplest form , is modelled by a fluid with a negative pressure , which is a fundamental ingredient to explain the actual accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain de @xcite .",
    "an alternative consists to consider a phenomenological variable de density with continuous creation / disruption of photons @xcite or matter @xcite .",
    "the de might decay / grow slowly in the course of the cosmic evolution and thus provide the source / sink term for matter and radiation .",
    "different such models have been discussed and strong constraints come from very accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and other typical cosmological probe .",

    "if we assume that each component is not conserved , contrarily to the standard scenario , then depending on the decay mechanism of the de , the created photons could lead to distortions in the planck spectrum of the cmb , and change the evolution of its temperature . the chance to appreciate the deviation from the standard temperature evolution",
    "is given by the increasingly number of recent works collecting observations of cmb temperature both at low @xcite and higher redshifts @xcite .",

    "@xcite we have discussed a variable de model @xmath7 decaying into photons and dm particles . in particular we studied thermodynamical aspects in the case of a continuous photon creation , which implies a modified temperature redshift relation for the cmb .",
    "we have tested the predicted temperature evolution of radiation with some recent data on the cmb at higher redshift from both sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect and high - redshift qso absorption lines .    in this paper",
    "we will present the results obtained in @xcite within a more detailed theoretical background , by further discussing the main hypothesis which concern the energy conservation and thermodynamical laws .",
    "furthermore , we will test our model with an updated collection of data , joining our sample with the new temperature observations reported in @xcite .",
    "for the first time we will combine to the temperature measurements also the data from different kind of observations , like distance moduli of supernovae ia , observations of the cmb anisotropy and the large - scale structure , together with observational hubble parameter estimations .",

    "we note that sns alone are not able to constrain the value of @xmath8 , producing very high uncertainties , also larger than the ones obtained using the temperature measurements alone .",
    "the baryon acoustic oscillation parameter does not help , while temperature measurements will allow to reduce the uncertainties .",
    "these probes produce slightly positive values for @xmath8 , while adding the shift parameter and/or the @xmath114 data give negative @xmath228 .",
    "anyway the uncertainties remain very large , with the only exception of the results when the shift parameter is used in the fitting , @xmath8 being in this case greatly constrained to @xmath229 .",
    "see table [ tab : omfixed ] for details .",
    "when @xmath230 is left free to vary , we find the best fitted values and cl contours shown in table [ tab : omfixed ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . remarkably , the best fitted values of  are perfectly in agreement with the values found in independent works @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is not surprising that the recovered values for @xmath8 , except for the case when only sns are fitted , are still quite consistent with the estimates obtained when  is fixed ( see table [ tab : omfixed ] ) .",
    "if we consider the fit with sn+a+ohd+r , then our best fitted parameters correspond to an effective equation of state @xmath231 , in the phantom regime but fully consistent with @xmath197 , and the transition redshift is @xmath232 .    adopting a standard de model with an equation of state @xmath233 , and",
    "@xmath234 free to vary , we have performed the fit , finding that @xmath235 , consistently with our results and still pointing to a cosmological constant as the best description for de .",
    "we have presented the properties of a variable de model , following the approach in jetzer et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the model relies on the assumption that the de component is not conserved and exchanges particles with both dm and radiation components . in particular",
    ", we show that in order to have a viable model , de needs to decay besides into radiation also in matter .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we have concentrated the analysis on the case when only a small fraction is exchanged with radiation .",
    "we have dedicated particular attention to the thermodynamic properties of the model , discussing the theoretical relation between the radiation temperature and redshift and we have matched it to the most updated collection of cmb temperature measurements @xcite , consisting of both sz data and high - redshift qso adsorption line observations .",
    "first , we have constrained the model by setting @xmath213 and finding @xmath236 , consistent with our previous estimate within uncertainties , still consistent with the standard case of a @xmath237 , i.e. with an effective equation of state @xmath238 . when @xmath13 is left free , then @xmath216 . although the large contours indicate that is not possible to find statistically relevant departures from a standard cosmological constant , we find that a decaying de , with an effective equation of state @xmath239 is preferred . then , for the first time , we test this kind of model combining both cmb temperature measurements and different observational data sets , like supernovae ia , cmb and large - scale structure data , etc . we find that  is almost independent on the combination of data we use , and in the best case is constrained to @xmath240 .",
    "moreover , while temperature measurements and sn data tend to furnish @xmath241 , consistently with a decaying de model , other datasets , like cmb data prefer the opposite situation with @xmath242 , i.e. a phantom - like model with @xmath243 .",
    "although the present data do not allow to find strong discrepancies with a classical cosmological constant model , we think that future surveys at high redshift could collect further measurements for cmb temperature , which could help us to further constrain the temperature - redshift relation .",
    "this kind of information , together with larger and higher quality samples of supernovae and better cmb data or other standard candles like gamma ray burst ( grbs ) can allow to give independent constraints on both matter density  and effective equation of state .",
    "we notice that if de does not decay into radiation ( corresponding to @xmath244 and thus @xmath8 is no longer constrained ) then the cmb temperature will scale in the standard way . clearly , this would imply that if de decays , this has to be into dm only . on the other hand a deviation of the cmb temperature from the standard scaling",
    "could be interpreted as de decaying also into radiation . in which case with",
    "( [ ma3 ] ) one can determine @xmath8 and/or @xmath99 and thus get some insights on the decay mode of de into radiation .",
    "future data on the cmb temperature will allow to shed light on this important issue ."
