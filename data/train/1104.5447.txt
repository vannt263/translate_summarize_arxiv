    "in 1948 , casimir predicted the attraction between perfect metal parallel plates @xcite and between neutral polarizable atoms @xcite due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "some years later , schwinger extended this formalism to dielectric plates at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "recently , a multiscattering formalism of the casimir effect for the electromagnetic field has been presented @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the casimir effect has some peculiarities .",
    "in particular , it is a non - pairwise interaction ; the casimir thermal force ( the thermal part of the casimir energy ) between two isolating bodies is not necessarily monotonic in their separation , as seen in the sphere  plate and cylinder  plate cases @xcite .",
    "in addition , for some geometries , intervals of negative entropy appear , as in the case of two parallel plates described by the drude model @xcite or , as recently shown , in the interaction between a drude model plate and sphere @xcite and in the interaction between a perfect metal plate and sphere @xcite .",
    "in this article we study the casimir effect between two spheres in the large separation approximation using different models for the electric permeability : ( 1 )  the perfect metal model , ( 2 )  the plasma model , and ( 3 )  the drude model . as a result , we find negative entropies in certain ranges of temperature and separation between the spheres for the perfect metal model , and for low penetration length for the plasma model .",
    "in addition , we find nonmonotonic behavior of the entropy with the separation while the force is attractive for all separations , making it appear as though the natural evolution of the system tends to increase the entropy in certain ranges of temperature and separation .",
    "for long plasma length and for the drude model we do not find this anomalous behavior of the entropy .",
    "we also discuss the thermodynamical meaning and consequences of negative entropies in casimir effect .",
    "the remainder of the article is arranged as follows : in sect .",

    "we can trace the origin of this anomalous effect to the functional form of the casimir energy in this large separation regime .",

    "when we study the asymptotic casimir effect with drude model spheres , the system is qualitatively different .",
    "the magnetic polarization does not contribute to the asymptotic casimir effect because it depends on @xmath124 instead of the @xmath125 dependence of the electric polarization term .",

    "nonmonotonicities of the casimir force between objects are not unusual .",
    "as the casimir effect is not pairwise additive , the interaction between two objects is affected by the presence of a third , leading to nonmonotonicities of the casimir force between cylinders @xcite , or between spheres @xcite in the presence of a plate .",
