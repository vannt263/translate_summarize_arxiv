    "<S> this is readily explained since at @xmath56 , the probability of finding spin islands only weakly interacting with others remains large and there is a vast number of quantum states at low energies .    as a main characteristics , these in - gap contributions exhibit an intrinsic @xmath50 linewidth , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figneutron2]c . </S>",
    "<S> this intrinsic linewidth is a measure of the spin island real - space magnetization profile . </S>",
    "<S> similar to conventional magnetic neutron scattering  @xcite , where intensity is modulated by the magnetic form factor ( the fourier transform of the magnetic ions unpaired electron density ) , scattering by spin islands is modulated by the square of the spin island form factor @xmath57  the fourier transform of its real space shape . </S>",
    "<S> a similar reasoning was applied to determine the spatial shape of emergent local objects in the substantially different cases of the charge - doped or depleted haldane spin chains y@xmath58ca@xmath4banio@xmath59 @xcite , y@xmath2bani@xmath3mg@xmath9o@xmath59 @xcite . for a spin island with exponentially decaying staggered magnetization on a ladder , </S>",
    "<S> the form factor reads as @xmath60 here , @xmath61 denotes the real space decay length and @xmath62 is the momentum transfer along the rung  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compared @xmath63 , averaged over @xmath62 , to our experimental data and by convolution with experimental resolution , we were able to quantify the real space decay length to be @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization profile thus decays to 10% of its initial value only after 15 unit cells and the size of an emergent spin island is of the order of 20 nm . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the determined decay length is slightly shorter than the numerically calculated value of @xmath65 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not surprising since in - gap states observed in experiments are located at a comparatively large energy transfer on the order of 0.1  mev and thus mainly originate from dimers or clusters of spin islands close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> influenced by the nearby spin islands , the magnetization profile thus deviates from the one of an isolated spin island .    in conclusion , by combining thermodynamic and high - resolution inelastic neutron scattering techniques with numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to quantitatively study the properties of a system of strongly interacting spin islands formed in a strong - leg heisenberg spin ladder depleted with non - magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> an effective description in the language of these objects explains and quantitatively reproduces the measured data . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the spin - ladder medium remains quantum disordered at @xmath66 , this effective description is faithful and , in principle , would allow not only to describe the thermodynamic response but even to access dynamical quantities such as time - dependent correlation functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> beyond @xmath67 , however , the effective description breaks down due to the quantum phase transition to the tlsl state  @xcite , rendering the spin - ladder correlation functions fundamentally different . to the authors knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> the problem of non - magnetic impurities and the fate of spin islands in the tlsl phase of a spin ladder or their influence on the magnetically ordered state @xcite has not been addressed experimentally or theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that our study stimulates further efforts and experiments towards understanding the impurity - induced physics in such systems .    </S>",
