    "the problem of calculating heavy ion induced continuum @xmath0 pair production to all orders in @xmath1 has received some renewed interest in the past several years .",
    "realization that in an appropriate gauge@xcite , the electromagnetic field of a relativistic heavy ion is to a very good approximation a delta function in the direction of motion of the heavy ion times the two dimensional solution of maxwell s equations in the transverse direction@xcite , led to an exact solution of the appropriate dirac equation for excitation of bound - electron positron pairs@xcite . given this solution ,",
    "it was perhaps not surprising that the solution of the dirac equation was obtained independently and practically simultaneously by two different collaborations@xcite for the analagous case of continuum @xmath0 pair production induced by the corresponding countermoving delta function potentials produced by ultrarelativistic heavy ions in a collider such as rhic .",
    "an extended discussion and reanalyis of this solution , with comments on early parallel work in the literature , shortly followed@xcite .",
    "one apparent physical consequence of this solution was that the rates for pair production in the exact solution agreed with the corresponding perturbation theory result@xcite .",
    "several authors subsequently argued@xcite that a correct regularization of the exact dirac equation amplitude should lead to deviations from perturbation theory , the so called coulomb corrections .",
    "although , as has been pointed out@xcite , the derived exact semiclassical dirac amplitude is not simply the exact amplitude for the excitation of a particular ( correlated ) electron - positron pair , there are observables , such as the total pair production cross section , that can be constructed from this derived amplitude",
    ". the exact amplitude for a correlated electron - positron pair will not be treated here .",
    "it is the coulomb corrections to the observables that _ can _ be constructed from this exact dirac equation amplitude that are the topic of this paper .    in what follows it",
    "will be shown from a somewhat different approach from what has been done before that coulomb corrections must exist , that they arise from the physical cutoff of the tranverse coulomb potential , and the accuracy of their evaluation has been up to now limited by an effective two - peak approximation to the exact retarded dirac amplitude .",

    "ignoring correction terms in @xmath18 ^ 2$])@xcite @xmath19 this is the potential that allowed the closed form solution of the dirac equation for the bound - electron positron problem .",

    "recall that this exact semiclassical solution produced a reduction of a little less than 10% in the predicted cross section for au + au at rhic@xcite ; one can identify this reduction as a coulomb correction to bound - electron positron pair production",
    ".    in the bound - electron positron problem one conveniently takes the electromagnetic field of one moving heavy ion seen in the rest frame of the heavy ion that receives the created electron . for production of continuum pairs in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion reaction one may work in in the center of mass frame and the electromagnetic interaction goes to the limit of two countermoving @xmath21 function potentials @xmath22 where @xmath23    the semi - classical dirac equation with this potential has been solved in closed form@xcite .",
    "baltz and mclerran@xcite noted the apparent agreement of the obtained amplitude with that of perturbation theory even for large @xmath24 .",
    "segev and wells@xcite also noted the agreement with perturbation theory and noted the scaling with @xmath25 seen in cern sps data@xcite .",
    "these data were obtained from reactions of 160 gev / c pb ions on c , al , pa , and au targets as well as 200 gev / c s ions on the same c , al , pa , and au targets . the group presenting the cern data , vane et al . , stated their findings in summary : `` cross sections scale as the product of the squares of the projectile and target nuclear charges . '' on the other hand , it is well known that photoproduction of @xmath0 pairs on a heavy target shows a negative ( coulomb ) correction proportional to @xmath26 that is well described by the bethe - maximon theory@xcite .",
    "as noted in the introduction , several authors have argued that a correct regularization of the exact dirac equation amplitude must lead to coulomb corrections .",
    "the first analysis was done in a weizsacker - williams approximation@xcite .",
    "subsequently , lee and milstein argued@xcite the existence of coulomb corrections by an approximate analysis of the closed form solution of the dirac equation .",
    "we will take as our starting point a somewhat extended consideration of the results of lee and milstein .    to begin let us write the previously derived semiclassical amplitude for electron - positron pair production@xcite in the notation of lee and milstein@xcite @xmath27 { \\cal m}({\\bf k } ) f_b({\\bf k } ) f_a({\\bf q_{\\perp } + p_{\\perp } - k}).\\ ] ]",

    "the point is that exact solution of the semi - classical dirac equation may be used to compute the inclusive average number of pairs  not an exclusive amplitude for a particular pair .",
    "calculating the exact exclusive amplitude to all orders in @xmath1 is not easily tractable due to need for feynman propagators@xcite .",
    "the possibility of solutions of the semi - classical dirac equation is connected to the retarded propagators involved . in this paper",
    "we do not consider the exclusive ( feynman propagator ) amplitude at all .",
    "we concentrate on observables that _ can _ be construted from the above amplitude and investigate the coulomb corrections contained in them .",
    "the occupation number or inclusive number of electrons created in state @xmath28 ( at impact parameter @xmath39 ) is @xmath40 likewise the inclusive number of positrons created in state @xmath29 is @xmath41 these inclusive expressions say nothing about correlations between electrons in state @xmath28 and and positrons in state @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 obviously @xmath32 and @xmath33 still have to be regularized or cut off at small @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the strategy of the first paper of lee and milstein@xcite was to evaluate coulomb corrections by taylor expanding @xmath64 around @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 . the derivative @xmath67 is evaluated at @xmath65 , and also in the evaluation of e.g. eq .",
    "( 26 ) @xmath30 is ignored in @xmath68 .",

    "they integrate @xmath76 to some finite upper limit @xmath77 an then claim to set @xmath77 to infinity in the resulting expression .",

    "lee and milstein state , `` thus , we come to a remarkable conclusion : although the main contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( 4 ) comes from the region of small @xmath76 , where @xmath85 differs from @xmath86 and depends on the regularization parameters ( the radius of screening ) , nevertheless the integral @xmath87 itself is a universal function of @xmath1 .

    "note that the upper cutoff of @xmath36 at @xmath116 has the effect of regularizing @xmath35 at small @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath35 goes to the constant @xmath117 as @xmath76 goes to zero in the @xmath118 perturbative case ; it goes to a reduced constant value as @xmath76 goes to zero for @xmath119 .",

    "( 11 ) @xmath37 is simply wrong because it is unphysical .",
    "since it lacks a proper physical cutoff in @xmath36 , it not only blows up at @xmath120 , but it also fails to exhibit the correct reduction in magnitude that occurs when @xmath113 is not too large .",
    "( 2 ) is an alternate display of results of the numerical calculations showing the fractional decrease in the ratio @xmath121 for various values of @xmath24 as a function of @xmath113 .",

    "( 41 ) .",
    "now let us consider @xmath87 again with the specific forms of @xmath35 displayed in fig .",
    "( 1 - 2 ) @xmath70\\ ] ] note that , given the @xmath124 dependence of @xmath35 and of eq .",
    "( 39 - 40 ) , this is a logarithmic integral of @xmath76 ( i.e @xmath125 ) times a function of @xmath113 .",

    "i attained agreement to one part in @xmath127 .    conjecturing that the detail of the cutoff should not matter",
    ", i replaced the function @xmath128 with a different function that also goes as @xmath129 ( plus an irrelevant constant , @xmath130 ) for small @xmath36 and also cuts off exponentially at @xmath131 : @xmath132.\\ ] ] calculations of @xmath87 with @xmath133 in place of @xmath134 similarly converge numerically to the result of lee and milstein with agreement to one part in @xmath127 .",
    "note however the non - identical shapes of the contribution to @xmath87 as a function of @xmath135 for the @xmath134 and @xmath133 transverse potential forms exhibited in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , even though the area above the two curves ( the value of @xmath87 ) is identical .",
    "now we can begin to understand the result of lee and milstein .",
    "the reason that `` the integral @xmath87 itself is a universal function of @xmath1 '' is that the first order @xmath136 factor from the expansion makes the integral @xmath87 logarithmic and so , contrary to what lee and milstein state , @xmath87 does not `` depend ... on the regularization parameters ( the radius of screening ) '' . the radius of screening , i.e. @xmath126 , is finite , but it has fallen out of the problem .",
    "furthermore `` the main contribution to the integral '' does not `` come from the region of small @xmath76 '' but , as is seen from the plot of the physically motivated @xmath134 curve in fig.(3 ) , the main contribution is peaked at @xmath137 and spreads out between half - maxima at @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "note that the decoupling of the coulomb corrections from @xmath126 seen in @xmath87 is only valid to first order in @xmath76 .",
    "including higher order terms in @xmath76 or , alternatively carrying out a full numerical evaluation of e.g. eq .",
    "( 26 ) , would necessarily restore some dependence on @xmath126 to the coulomb corrections .",
    "a previous monte carlo perturbation theory calculation of bottcher and strayer@xcite displays the pair production cross section as a function of @xmath140 , and shows a significant deviation between an exact monte carlo evaluation of the cross section and evaluation using a two peak approximation ( in particular see fig.(9 ) of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since in carrying out their calculation , lee and milstein made a variety of a two peak approximation ( assuming @xmath140 small ) , one has to assume that the precision of their results is limited .",
    "to lowest order in transverse momentum ( small @xmath76 and small @xmath140 ) , coulomb corrections do exist as a universal function of @xmath141 , where @xmath141 is the same function of bethe and maximon derived for coulomb corrections to electron - positron pair photoproduction .",
    "these coulomb corrections reduce the uncorrelated electron or positron production cross sections and the number weighted total pair cross section .",
    "in general and not limited to lowest order in transverse momentum , coulomb corrections are a function of only @xmath24 and the combination variable @xmath142 .",
    "coulomb corrections arise from the finite cutoff of the transverse spatial integral at @xmath126 and vanish for large @xmath113 .",
    "since the cern data cover a large part of the momentum range of produced positrons and scale perturbatively , they still seem to present a puzzle .",
    "it would be useful to carry out full calculations of the total number weighted cross section @xmath50 as well as of the uncorrelated momentum dependent electron and positron cross sections @xmath143 and @xmath144 , utilizing the transverse integrals with a correct physical cutoff . since the cern data only detects positrons , comparison with a full calculation of @xmath144 is appropriate .",
