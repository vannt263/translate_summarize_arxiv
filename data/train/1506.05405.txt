    "let @xmath0 be the root system of a rank 2 kac  moody algebra @xmath11 .",

    "let @xmath13 denote a basis of simple roots of @xmath0 . if @xmath4 , then @xmath0 is non - symmetric and its base consists of a long simple root and a short simple root , whereas if @xmath5 , @xmath0 is symmetric and its base consists of two long simple roots .",
    "the root system @xmath0 contains two types of roots ; real and imaginary .",
    "the real roots of @xmath0 are of the form @xmath14 for some @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the weyl group of the root system . in the rank 2 hyperbolic case , @xmath17 ,",
    "is the infinite dihedral group .",
    "the additional imaginary roots will not play a significant role in this work .",
    "the real roots are supported on the branches of a hyperbola in @xmath18 , with a pair of branches for each root length ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we are also motivated by the following question .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are real roots of a kac - moody group , then the commutator @xmath21 $ ] involves the root group corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "the commutator @xmath21 $ ] is then trivial if the sum @xmath22 is not a root . in order to determine the non  trivial commutators in the kac",
    " moody group associated to @xmath23 , we may therefore reduce to the study of rank 2 root subsystems in a general kac ",
    "moody root system .",
    "this observation provides the setting for the current work .    as observed by morita ( @xcite , @xcite ) , to determine the group commutators , it is also necessary to characterize the set of positive @xmath24linear combinations @xmath25 for real roots @xmath26 whose sum is a real root .",
    "a similar question was answered in arbitrary kac  moody root systems by billig and pianzola ( [ bp ] ) .",
    "we obtain an explicit description of this set for all rank 2 hyperbolic root systems .    in future work",
    ", we will use these results to determine the non  trivial group commutators and their structure constants ( [ cmw ] ) .",
    "we obtain proofs of the results stated by morita ( @xcite ) that if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are both greater than one , then no sum of real roots can be a real root .",
    "it follows that the prounipotent subgroup corresponding to the positive real roots on a single branch of the hyperbola is commutative . when @xmath27 or @xmath29 we prove , as stated in @xcite , that the prounipotent subgroup generated by all the positive real short root groups is metabelian and the prounipotent subgroup generated by all the positive real long root groups is commutative .",
    "our results in sections  [ rootsums ] and [ rk2subsys ] also cover the affine cases @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in order to make our results precise , we use two different concepts of a subsystem generated by a subset @xmath32 of real roots : namely a subsystem @xmath33 ,",
    "corresponding to a reflection subgroup of the weyl group and consisting entirely of real roots ; and @xmath34 consisting of all roots that can be written as an integral linear combination of elements of @xmath32 .",
    "such a @xmath34 subsystem contains both real and imaginary roots and corresponds to a certain subalgebra of the kac  moody algebra .",
    "we have classified both kinds of subsystem inside a rank 2 infinite root system , and found that the two concepts of subsystem are equivalent in almost all cases :    let @xmath0 be a rank 2 infinite root system and let @xmath32 be a set of real roots which generate @xmath0 , that is , @xmath35 .",
    "then either @xmath33 is the set of all real roots in @xmath0 or it is the set of all _ short _ real roots in @xmath0 .",
    "the second case occurs only if @xmath36 or @xmath29 and @xmath33 consists of short roots .",
    "our classification also gives us the following result , which holds for either concept of subsystem :    [ infsubs ] if @xmath0 is a rank 2 hyperbolic root system , then @xmath0 contains symmetric rank 2 hyperbolic root subsystems of type @xmath6 for infinitely many distinct @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath0 is non - symmetric of type @xmath23 , then it also contains non - symmetric rank 2 hyperbolic root subsystems of type @xmath37 for infinitely many distinct @xmath38 .",
    "we also classify the rank 2 @xmath39-subsystems as finite , affine or hyperbolic systems :    let @xmath0 be a rank 2 root system and let @xmath32 be a nonempty set of real roots in @xmath0 .    1 .   if @xmath0 is finite , then @xmath33 is finite .",
    "2 .   if @xmath0 is affine of type @xmath40 , then @xmath33 has finite type @xmath41 or affine type @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath0 is affine of type @xmath42 , then @xmath33 has finite type @xmath41 , or affine type @xmath40 or @xmath42 .",
    "4 .   if @xmath0 is hyperbolic , then @xmath33 has finite type @xmath41 or hyperbolic type .",
    "we mention the following related works : this work was inspired by the papers @xcite and @xcite where the results of interest were stated without proof .",
    "feingold and nicolai ( @xcite , theorem 3.1 ) gave a method for generating a subalgebra corresponding to a @xmath34type root subsystem for a certain choice of real roots in any kac ",
    "moody algebra .    as in section 4 of this paper , casselman ( @xcite ) reduced the study of structure constants for kac  moody algebras to rank 2 subsystems . some of our results in section 4 overlap with section 4 of @xcite .",
    "tumarkin ( @xcite ) gave a classification the sublattices of hyperbolic root lattices of the same rank .",
    "however , he requires conditions on the possible angles between roots that exclude all but a finite number of rank 2 hyperbolic root systems .",
    "in contrast , for our intended application to kac  moody groups , we require the explicit construction of the embedding of the simple roots of a subsystems into the ambient system , rather than just describing its root lattice .",
    "the authors are very grateful to chuck weibel for his careful reading of the msc thesis ( [ sr ] ) of the fourth author .",
    "this research was greatly facilitated by experiments carried out in the computational algebra systems magma ( @xcite ) and maple ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath43 be the @xmath44 generalized cartan matrix in [ acp ] . ]",
    "@xmath45 for positive integers @xmath46 , with kac  moody algebra @xmath47 , root system @xmath48 , and weyl group @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 , @xmath51 is positive definite and so @xmath0 is finite . when @xmath52 , @xmath51 is positive semi - definite but not positive definite and so @xmath0 is affine . when @xmath53 , @xmath51 is indefinite but every proper generalized cartan submatrix is positive definite , and so @xmath51 is hyperbolic . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote a basis of simple roots of @xmath0 .",
    "we have the simple root reflections @xmath55 for @xmath56 with matrices with respect to @xmath57 @xmath58_s = \\left(\\begin{array}{rr } -1&b\\\\0&1\\end{array}\\right),\\qquad [ w_2]_s = \\left(\\begin{array}{rr }   1&0\\\\a&-1\\end{array}\\right).\\ ] ] the weyl group @xmath49 is the group generated by the simple root reflections @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a symmetrization of @xmath51 .",
    "this defines the symmetric bilinear form @xmath62_s^tb[v]_s$ ] and quadratic form @xmath63 , which are preserved under the action of @xmath16 .",
    "so the set of real roots is @xmath64 since @xmath0 is finite , affine , or hyperbolic , the set of imaginary roots is @xmath65        every root @xmath67 has an expression of the form @xmath68 where the @xmath69 are either all @xmath70 , in which case @xmath19 is called _ positive _ , or all @xmath71 , in which case @xmath19 is called _",
    "negative_. the positive roots are denoted @xmath72 , the negative roots @xmath73 .    now @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "so all real roots @xmath76 in the orbit @xmath77 satisfy @xmath78 and all real roots @xmath76 in the orbit @xmath79 satisfy @xmath80 these curves are displayed in figures  13 as blue ( resp .",
    "red ) dotted lines .",
    "these curves are elliptical for finite systems , straight lines for affine systems , and hyperbolas for hyperbolic systems . if @xmath0 is nonsymmetric ( @xmath81 ) the roots in @xmath77 are called _ long _ and the roots in @xmath79 are called _",
    "short_. if @xmath0 is symmetric ( @xmath82 ) then all roots are considered to be _ long_. note that ( with the exception of @xmath83 ) , the real roots fall into two distinct orbits under the action of @xmath16 .",
    "the diagrams use red for the orbit of @xmath84 , blue for the orbit of @xmath85 , and black for the imaginary roots .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the action of @xmath59 while the vertical lines indicate the action of @xmath60 .    for @xmath86",
    ", we define @xmath87 all real roots are given by these four sequences .",
    "if @xmath88 , then these are all distinct , and a root is positive if and only if @xmath89 . the roots for @xmath90 are given in table  [ t - rts ] .",
    "let @xmath91 be a @xmath39-subsystem of @xmath0 .",
    "first suppose that @xmath92 .",
    "then proposition  [ iclass](i ) implies that @xmath93 for some @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath96 , this gives us type @xmath97 .",
    "otherwise it is easily shown that every positive root in @xmath91 is a positive linear combination of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , so this forms a base . the cartan matrix and inner product matrix",
    "can be computed directly from the base .",
    "for example , if the cartan matrix is @xmath100 then @xmath101 where the second last equality follows from lemma  [ acp](ii ) .",
    "this gives type @xmath102 .",

    "if @xmath0 is hyperbolic , then @xmath33 has finite type @xmath41 or hyperbolic type .",
    "we now consider the classification of @xmath0-subsystems of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath122 nonempty and recall that @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "since the imaginary roots of an affine or hyperbolic root system are just the linear combinations of real roots with nonpositive norm , it will suffice to describe @xmath125 . from the definition of a reflection",
    ", we can see that @xmath126 for all @xmath127 , and so @xmath128 we also have @xmath129 , so the real roots of a @xmath0-subsystem always form a @xmath39-subsystem , but possibly for a dif and only iferent set of generators .",
