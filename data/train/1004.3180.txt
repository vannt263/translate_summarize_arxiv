    "it is well - known that conformal transformations realized in quantum field theories in four - dimensional spacetime as a rule are beset with anomalies . formulated in terms of green functions ( which are off - shell quantities",

    "the question arises which effects of these anomalies survive in physical quantities like @xmath0-matrix or green functions of physical operators .",

    "we could not detect the transformation . via the @xmath117 and its non - trivial dependence on @xmath102",
    "we can however spot it .",
    "so , clearly one can not identify the underlying spacetime per se , out of nothing , but the _ change _ from a fourdimensional minkowski space to a fourdimensional dilated space is characterized by the @xmath2-function .",

    "! + again the same comment applies as in the case of dilatations : due to the non - vanishing @xmath2-function we can identify the ( conformally ) transformed spacetime departing from ordinary minkowski space .",
    "in the present paper we treat two topics .",
    "the first one concerns the change of the @xmath0-matrix under dilatations and special conformal transformations of the massless @xmath1 theory in the context of perturbation theory . for dilatations",
    "zimmermann @xcite has obtained the respective result ( [ rgequat ] ) in an axiomatic setting .",
    "we arrive perturbatively at the same , ( [ dilcoms ] ) , by rendering the coupling local and using the fact that with the help of local @xmath8 all dilatational anomalies can be absorbed into a homogeneous wi ( [ homdwi ] ) @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath8 is local there is at every vertex a non - vanishing external momentum , hence one can go on - shell without meeting an infrared divergence . following zimmermann",
    "we assume that the non - perturbative theory is linked to the perturbative version in the sense of an asymptotic expansion .",
    "we know therefore from @xcite that no infrared divergences can arise in the limit of constant coupling , once we realize perturbatively the same normalization conditions as employed by zimmermann , which we do .",
    "the amputated on - shell green functions are thus finite .",
    "single diagrams may be infrared divergent , but these divergences cancel in the sum which represents the green function . and ,",
    "indeed , in the one - loop approximation which is given by just one diagram , no infrared divergence shows up .",
    "+ for special conformal transformations we find the analogous result , ( [ confcoms ] ) . by the moment",
    "construction the special conformal transformations are closely related to the dilatations , hence the same cancellation of infrared divergences takes place , as the one - loop approximation shows explicitly .",
    "+ the learned reader might object that the @xmath1-theory is trivial .",
    "however , rigorous proofs of triviality exist only for dimensions strictly smaller or strictly larger than four . for exactly four dimensions no such proof seems to be available .    as second topic we discuss an application of these results for the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we show that upon introduction of a suitable effective coupling an @xmath0-matrix can be defined which signals the underlying transformed spacetime which is obtained from minkowski space by dilatation , special conformal transformation respectively ( [ dilspaces ] ) , ( [ confspaces ] ) .",
    "crucial is here the fact that the @xmath2-function does not vanish . in the case of dilatations",
    "this effective coupling agrees with the standard running coupling obtained from the renormalization group equation .",
    "the effective coupling for the special conformal case ( [ effcoupconf ] ) is particularly interesting because it depends explicitly on @xmath123 .",
    "constant coupling then means conformally constant !",
    "+ in our understanding we contribute with this result to a presently ongoing general program : the construction of quantum field theories on non - trivial spacetimes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . beginning perhaps with wald @xcite it gradually became clear how to define @xmath0-matrices on spacetimes which are globally hyperbolic and asymptotically flat . here",
    "we present an explicit and non - trivial example : the perturbatively non - trivial @xmath0-matrix of @xmath1-theory in minkowski space gets translated to a dilated , resp .",
    "conformally ( flat ) spacetime via the effective coupling . if it is possible to go to finite transformations one will obtain ( in the conformal case ) a space which is curved , conformally and asymptotically flat .",
    "if one succeeds to find the corresponding expression for the @xmath0-matrix ( i.e.  one integrates the effective coupling ) one has a non - trivial @xmath0-matrix on such a space .",
    "+ the axioms which hold for @xmath124 on minkowski space get via @xmath125 translated on the transformed space , wherefrom its explicit realization can be read off , notably that of locality , i.e.  causality .",
    "+ @xmath2-functions arise from zimmermann identities among normal products .",
    "the zimmermann coefficients encode the information on anomalies , hence when interpreted as we propose also on spacetimes .",
    "+ which extensions of these results can one expect in other theories ?",
    "of utmost interest are gauge theories .",
    "there , however one has to cope with the fact that gauge fixing is not conformally invariant .",
    "therefore the identification of the physical subspace of the entire fock space is technically non - trivial . if the @xmath0-matrix exists , i.e.  in models with complete breakdown of the gauge symmetry , one has to separate the soft breaking of conformal invariance from hard breaking .",
    "but then one should find essentially similar results as presented here .",
    "this expectation is based on the fact , that the @xmath2-functions can be constructed as gauge independent quantities .",
    "if the @xmath0-matrix does not exist ( e.g.  in pure qcd ) one has to consider other observables , the energy - momentum tensor being a prime candidate . here one has to check whether other anomalies than those related to the @xmath2-function come into play .",
    "as far the identification of an underlying spacetime is concerned we expect in any case an analogous result to the above : anomalies of geometric symmetries identify respective spacetimes .",
    "+ what about anomalies of internal symmetries ? here we expect a change of geometry of the internal space .",
    "the relevant anomaly coefficients are , if properly constructed , also gauge independent , hence physical .",
    "the geometry of the internal space might get a non - trivial physical meaning .",
    "these questions certainly deserve further investigation .        in this appendix",
    "we calculate explicitly the one - loop contribution to the scattering amplitude of two particles going into two particles and the conformal transformation of this process .",
    "there are two diagrams contributing to this s - matrix element @xmath126 : they involve four fields and the outcome is equivalent to the four - point vertex function @xmath127 at the same loop order .",
    "we expect a contribution to the breaking of conformal invariance as shown in @xcite , clearly for constant coupling . since the counterterm behaves trivially under special conformal transformations we can omit its treatment .",
