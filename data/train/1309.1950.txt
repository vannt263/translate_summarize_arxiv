    "the early time inflationary stage of the universe evolution can address successfully some problems of the standard big bang cosmology such as the flatness , horizon and relics problems .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been proposed to model an inflationary universe .",
    "one of the simple inflationary models is the one in which the universe is filled with a canonical scalar field ( inflaton ) [ 1 - 8 ] . in order to run inflation successfully , the potential energy of the inflaton should dominate the kinetic energy of the field .",
    "but , this simple inflation paradigm , suffers by itself from several problems with no concrete solutions [ 6,9 ] .",
    "so , other inflationary models such as the braneworld models [ 10 - 14 ] , models with non - minimally coupled inflaton field [ 15 - 22 ] , modified gravity [ 23 - 25 ] and so on , with a wide range of potentials and with successes and shortcomings , have attracted much attention these years . in this regard ,",
    "a large number of models have been proposed but this does not mean that all of these models are observationally viable . for a model to be viable ,",
    "its consistency with observational data is inevitable .",
    "also a successful inflationary model is the one that can provide a mechanism for generating the initial fluctuations and perturbations in the early universe and therefore seed the formation of the structures in the universe . in this",
    "regard , fluctuation in the scalar field leads to the scalar power spectra and fluctuation in the transverse and traceless parts of the metric leads to the tensor power spectra [ 1 - 8 ] .",
    "the scalar power spectrum of the perturbation is nearly scale - invariant , that is , the spectral index is about unity . the exact value of the spectral index can be obtained by using the observational data .",
    "the running of the spectral index and also , the ratio between the amplitudes of tensor and scalar perturbations ( tensor - to - scalar ratio ) are others inflationary parameters which can be constrained observationally .",
    "the values of these parameters calculated in a specific inflation model and compared with observational data , are powerful probes to save or rule out the inflation model under consideration .",
    "the recently released planck observational data , have constrained the inflationary parameters even more accurately than previous probes [ 26 ] . those models which their inflationary parameters lie within the @xmath1 or @xmath2 cl with planck data can be considered as observationally viable proposals for inflation . in ref .",
    "[ 26 ] , the authors have considered some types of the potential and have found some constraints on the models parameters .",
    "for example , they have shown that a 4-dimension model with a linear potential lies well inside the planck data while a 4-dimension model with an exponential potential is well outside the planck data .",
    "also @xmath3 inflation based on modified gravity has a very good agreement with planck data .    in the present paper ,",
    "following our recent work [ 14 ] , we consider a branworld model with a non - minimal coupling between the induced ricci scalar and the inflaton field on the brane . by adopting six types of potential ,",
    "we perform a numerical analysis on the inflationary parameters of this model . in the background of the planck+wmap9+bao data ,",
    "the parameters of the model can be constrained tightly .",
    "we find that some potentials that are suitable in 4-dimensional case in comparison with observational data , can not lead to a successful inflationary model in 5-dimension in the minimal case .",
    "however , by considering a non - minimal coupling between the scalar field and induced gravity term on the brane , we achieve good results in some ranges of the non - minimal coupling parameter . on the other hand , some potentials which are not compatible with planck data in a 4-dimensional model , lead to good results in a branworld setup .",
    "in this section we present preliminaries and the mathematical framework of our setup based on our recent work [ 14 ] .",
    "we consider a warped dgp model in which an inflaton field is non - minimally coupled with the induced ricci scalar on the brane and its action is given by the following expression @xmath4+\\int_{brane } d^{4 } x \\sqrt{-q}\\bigg[\\frac{1}{2\\kappa_{4}^{2}}r + \\frac{f(\\varphi)}{2}\\,r-\\lambda- \\frac{1}{2}q^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi\\partial_{\\nu}\\varphi - v(\\varphi)\\bigg ]   \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5,@xmath6,@xmath7,@xmath8and @xmath9 are the five dimensional gravitational constant , the induced ricci scalar on the brane , 5-dimensional ricci scalar , the brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the trace of the brane metric , @xmath11 .",
    "also , @xmath12 shows the non - minimal coupling of the scalar field with induced gravity on the brane .",
    "the action ( [ 1 ] ) in a frw background gives the generalized cosmological dynamics in this setup by the following friedmann equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy - density corresponding to the non - minimally coupled scalar field given by @xmath15 also , the corresponding pressure is defined as follows @xmath16 where a prime represents the derivative with respect to the scalar field and a dot marks derivative with respect to the cosmic time",
    ".    here we are interested in the case where inflationary dynamics is driven by a scalar field with a self - interacting potential .",
    "so , the effective cosmological constant on the brane which is defined as @xmath17 should be equal to zero , so that @xmath18 now , the friedmann equation ( [ 2 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath19 in our setup , the slow - roll parameters ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , in the slow - roll approximation ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , take the following form respectively @xmath24 and @xmath25 where by definition @xmath26 ^ 2},\\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath27 equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) reflect the non - minimal coupling of the scalar field and induced gravity on the brane and also , braneworld nature of the setup .",
    "the number of e - folds form initial of inflation ( @xmath28 ) until the time where the inflation ends ( @xmath29 ) , is given by @xmath30 . for a warped dgp model with a non -",
    "minimally coupled scalar field on the brane , the number of e - folds takes the following expression @xmath31d\\varphi\\,\\,.\\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , in equation ( [ 12 ] ) , @xmath32 marks the value of @xmath33 when the universe scale crosses the hubble horizon during inflation and @xmath34 denotes the value of @xmath33 when the universe exits the inflationary phase .",
    "the spectrum of perturbations produced due to quantum fluctuations of the fields about their homogeneous background values is the important way to test the viability of inflationary models . with the following perturbed frw metric @xmath35 which is defined in a longitudinal gauge [ 27 - 29 ] ,",
