    "intuitively , conformal mappings map infinitesimal circles to infinitesimal circles , while quasi - conformal mappings map infinitesimal circles to infinitesimal ellipses with bounded eccentricity @xcite .",
    "mathematically , quasi - conformal mappings can be defined as follows .",
    "@xmath5 is a _ quasi - conformal mapping _ if it satisfies the beltrami equation @xmath6 for some complex - valued function @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 and that @xmath9 is non - vanishing almost everywhere .",
    "+    the complex - valued function @xmath7 is called the _ beltrami coefficient _ of the quasi - conformal mapping @xmath10 .",
    "the beltrami coefficient serves as a measure of the non - conformality of @xmath10 .",
    "it measures how far the mapping @xmath10 at each point deviates from a conformal mapping .",
    "a geometric illustration of quasi - conformal mappings is provided in figure [ fig : bc ] .",
    "in addition , the _ maximal quasi - conformal dilation _ of @xmath10 is given by @xmath11    for the composition of two quasi - conformal mappings , the associated beltrami coefficient can be expressed in terms of the beltrami coefficients of the two mappings .",
    "[ thm : composition ] let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be two quasi - conformal mappings .",
    "then the beltrami coefficient of @xmath14 is given by @xmath15    conversely , a quasi - conformal mapping can also be determined by a complex function . given a beltrami coefficient @xmath16 with @xmath17 ,",
    "there is always a quasi - conformal mapping from @xmath18 onto itself which satisfies the beltrami equation ( [ eqt : beltrami ] ) in the distribution sense @xcite .",
    "therefore , finding an optimal quasi - conformal mapping is equivalent to finding an optimal complex - valued function .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath7 be a given beltrami coefficient associated with a quasi - conformal map @xmath19 .",
    "the computation of @xmath10 can be achieved by solving an equation analogous to the laplace equation @xmath20 .",
