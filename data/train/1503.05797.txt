    ". explanations of this connection between spin and statistics have been sought since the early days of quantum field theory .",
    "fierz  @xcite and pauli  @xcite investigated the issue in free field theories , setting in train a number of progressively more general results .",
    "the rigorous proof of a connection between spin and statistics was an early and major achievement of the axiomatic wightman framework ; see @xcite and the classic presentation in  @xcite .",
    "similarly , general results have been proved in the haag ",
    "kastler framework  @xcite , for example , @xcite . in these more algebraic settings , statistics",
    "is not tied to the properties of particular fields , but rather understood in terms of the graded commutativity of local algebras corresponding to spacelike - separated regions  @xcite , or the properties of superselection sectors @xcite .    nonetheless , the theoretical account of the spin - statistics connection is subtle and even fragile .",
    "nonrelativistic models of quantum field theory are not bound by it , and as pauli observed  @xcite , one may impose bosonic statistics on a dirac field at the cost of sacrificing positivity of the hamiltonian .",
    "ghost fields introduced in gauge theories violate the connection , but also involve indefinite inner products .",
    "the rigorous proofs therefore rely on hilbert space positivity and energy positivity .",
    "moreover , they make essential use of the poincar symmetry group and its complex extension together with analyticity properties of the vacuum @xmath1-point functions .",
    "the spin - statistics connection observed in nature , however , occurs in a spacetime which is not minkowski space and indeed has no geometrical symmetries .",
    "there is neither a global notion of energy positivity ( or , more properly , the spectrum condition ) nor do we expect @xmath1-point functions in typical states of interest on generic spacetimes to have analytic extensions .",
    "thus the general proofs mentioned have no traction and it is far from clear how they can be generalized : _ a priori _ it is quite conceivable that the theoretical spin - statistics connection is an accident of special relativity that is broken in passing to the curved spacetimes of general relativity .    indeed , for many years , work on the spin - statistics connection in curved spacetimes was restricted to demonstrations that free models become inconsistent on general spacetimes if equipped with the wrong statistics ( e.g. , imposing anticommutation relations on a scalar field ) @xcite unless some other important property such as positivity is sacrificed  @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough was made by verch @xcite , who established a general spin - statistics theorem for theories defined on each spacetime by a single field which , in particular , obeys wightman axioms in minkowski space .",
    "together with , this paper was responsible for laying down many of the foundations of what has become the locally covariant framework for qft in curved spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "verch s assumptions allow certain properties of the theory on one spacetime to be deduced from its properties on another , provided the spacetimes are suitably related by restrictions or deformations of the metric .",
    "in particular , the spin - statistics connection is proved by noting that if it were violated in any one spacetime , it would be violated in minkowski space , contradicting the classic spin - statistics theorem .",
    "nonetheless , there are good reasons to revisit the spin - statistics connection in curved spacetime .",
    "first , as a matter of principle , one would like to gain a better undestanding of why spin is the correct concept to investigate in curved spacetime , given the lack of the rotational symmetries that are so closely bound up with the description of spin in minkowski space .",
    "a second , related , point is that @xcite describes spinor fields as sections of various bundles associated to the spin bundle .",
    "while this is conventional wisdom in qft in cst , it has the effect of basing the discussion on geometric structures that are , in part , unobservable .",
    "this is not a great hindrance if the aim is to discuss a particular model such as the dirac field .",
    "however , we wish to understand the spin - statistics connection for general theories , without necessarily basing the description on fields at all . with that goal in mind , one needs a more fundamental starting point that avoids the insertion of spin by hand .",
    "third , the result proved in @xcite is confined to theories in which the algebra in each spacetime is generated by a single field , and the argument is indirect in parts .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to sketch a new and operationally well - motivated perspective on the spin - statistics connection in which spin emerges as a natural concept in curved spacetimes , and which leads to a more general and direct proof of the connection . in particular",
    ", there is no longer any need to describe the theory in terms of one or more fields .",
    "full details will appear shortly  @xcite .",
    "the key ideas are ( a ) a formalisation of the reasoning underlying @xcite as a ` rigidity argument ' , and ( b ) a generalization of locally covariant qft based on a category of spacetimes with global coframes ( i.e. , a ` rods and clocks ' account of spacetime measurements ) . as in @xcite",
    "the goal is to prove that a spin - statistics connection in curved spacetime is implied by the standard results holding in minkowski space ; however , the proof becomes quite streamlined in the new formulation .",
    "we begin by describing the standard version of locally covariant qft , describing the rigidity argument and some of its other applications in that context , before moving to discussion of framed spacetimes and the spin - statistics theorem .",
    "locally covariant qft is a general framework for qft in curved spacetimes , due to brunetti , fredenhagen and verch ( bfv ) @xcite , which comprises three main assumptions .",
    "the first is the assertion that any quantum field theory respecting locality and covariance can be described a covariant functor @xmath2 from the category of globally hyperbolic spacetimes @xmath3 to a category @xmath4 of unital @xmath0-algebras .- algebra category @xmath5 , and other types of physical theory can be accommodated by making yet other choices . ]",
    "this assumption already contains a lot of information and we shall unpack it in stages , beginning with the spacetimes .",
    "object of @xmath3 are oriented and time - oriented globally hyperbolic spacetimes ( of fixed dimension @xmath1 , which we will take to be four ) and with finitely many components .- forms , and likewise to describe the time - orientation by means of connected component of the set of nonvanishing timelike @xmath6-form fields .",
    "our signature convention throughout is @xmath7 . ]",
    "morphisms between spacetimes in @xmath3 are _ hyperbolic embeddings _ ,",
    "i.e. , isometric embeddings preserving time and space orientations with causally convex image .",
    "the category @xmath4 has objects that are unital @xmath0-algebras , with morphisms that are injective , unit - preserving @xmath0-homomorphisms .",
    "the functoriality condition requires that the theory assigns an object @xmath8 of @xmath4 to each spacetime @xmath9 of @xmath3 , and , furthermore , that each hyperbolic embedding of spacetimes @xmath10 is mirrored by an embedding of the corresponding algebras @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 for all composable embeddings @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    despite its somewhat formal expression ,",
    "this assumption is well - motiv - ated from an operational viewpoint and provides a natural generalization of the haag ",
    "kastler  araki axiomatic description of quantum field theory in minkowski space .",
    "indeed , as emphasized by bfv , this single assumption already contains several distinct assumptions of the minkowski framework .",
    "the next ingredient in the bfv framework is the _",
    "kinematic net _ indexed by @xmath15 , the set of all open causally convex subsets of @xmath9 with finitely many connected components .",
    "each @xmath16 can be regarded as a spacetime @xmath17 in its own right , by restricting the causal and metric structures of @xmath9 to @xmath18 , whereupon the inclusion map of @xmath18 into the underlying manifold of @xmath9 induces a @xmath3 morphism @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : inclusion ] ) .",
    "the theory @xmath20 therefore assigns an algebra @xmath21 and an embedding of this algebra into @xmath8 , and we define the kinematic subalgebra to be the image @xmath22 as mentioned above , the net @xmath23 is the appropriate generalization of the net of local observables studied in minkowski space aqft .",

    "for instance , the kinematic algebras are covariantly defined , in the sense that @xmath25 for all morphisms @xmath10 and all nonempty @xmath16 .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the definitions above and functoriality of @xmath20 .",
    "similarly spacetime symmetries of @xmath9 are realised as automorphisms of the kinematic net in a natural way .",
    "it is usual to assume two additional properties .",
    "first , the theory obeys _",
    "einstein causality _ if , for all causally disjoint @xmath26 ( i.e. , no causal curve joins @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) , the corresponding kinematic algebras commute elementwise .",

    "i.e. , a morphism whose image contains a cauchy surface of the ambient spacetime , to an isomorphism in @xmath4 .",
    "this assumption encodes the dynamics of the theory and plays an important role in allowing the instantiations of @xmath20 on different spacetimes to be related .",
    "in fact , any two spacetimes @xmath9 and @xmath29 in @xmath3 can be linked by a chain of cauchy morphisms if and only if their cauchy surfaces are related by an orientation - preserving diffeomorphism ( see ( * ? ? ? * prop .",

    "the assumptions just stated are satisfied by simple models , such as the free klein  gordon field  @xcite , and , importantly , for perturbatively constructed models of a scalar field with self - interaction . in order",
    "to be self - contained , we briefly describe the free theory corresponding to the minimally coupled klein  gordon theory , with field equation @xmath32 : in each spacetime @xmath33 , one defines a unital @xmath0-algebra @xmath8 with generators @xmath34 ( ` smeared fields ' ) labelled by test functions @xmath35 and subject to the following relations :    * @xmath36 is linear * @xmath37 * @xmath38 * @xmath39 = ie_{{\\boldsymbol{m}}}(f , f'){{\\mathbf{1}}}_{{{\\mathscr{a}}}({{\\boldsymbol{m}}})}$ ]    where @xmath40 is constructed from the advanced ( @xmath41 ) and retarded ( @xmath42 ) green operators ( which obey @xmath43 ) .",

    "our discussion will use two more features of the general structure .",
    "first , the field content is described by natural transformations between the functor @xmath47 assigning the space of test functions to spacetimes and the functor @xmath20 ( suppressing a forgetful functor ) @xcite .",
    "this means that to each spacetime @xmath33 there is a map @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 holds for each @xmath10 , where @xmath50 is push - forward .",
    "the prototypical example is the klein ",
    "gordon field , of course .",
    "the description just given applies to scalar fields ; fields of other tensorial types may be incorporated by suitable alternatives choices of @xmath47 .",
    "as will be discussed later , spinorial fields require a modification of the category @xmath3 .",
    "second , natural transformations may also be used to compare locally covariant theories .",
    "a natural @xmath51 is interpreted as an embedding of @xmath20 as a subtheory of @xmath52 , while a natural isomorphism indicates that the theories are physically equivalent  @xcite .",
    "naturality requires that to each @xmath33 there is a morphism @xmath53 @xmath54 for each morphism @xmath10 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath55 as a subtheory embedding can be justified on several grounds ",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the equivalences of @xmath20 with itself form the group @xmath56 of automorphisms of the functor .",
    "this has a nice physical interpretation : it is the global gauge group @xcite .",
    "locally covariant qft is not merely an elegant formalism for rephrasing known results and models .",
    "it has led to new departures in the description of qft in curved spacetimes .",
    "these can be divided into those that are model - independent and those that are specific to particular theories .",
    "those of the former type include the spin - statistics connection @xcite ; the introduction of the relative cauchy evolution and intrinsic understanding of the stress - energy tensor @xcite ; an analogue of the reeh  schlieder theorem  @xcite and the split property @xcite ; new approaches to superselection theory   and the understanding of global gauge transformations  @xcite ; a no - go theorem for preferred states  @xcite , and a discussion of how one can capture the idea that a theory describes ` the same physics in all spacetimes ' @xcite .",
    "model - specific applications include , above all , the perturbative construction of interacting models , including those with gauge symmetries @xcite .",
    "however , there are also applications to the theory of quantum energy inequalities and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the framework of local covariance appears quite loose , but in fact the descriptions of the theory in different spacetimes are surprisingly tightly related .",
    "there are various interesting properties which , if they hold in minkowski space , must also hold in general spacetimes .",
    "this will apply in particular to the spin ",
    "statistics connection ; as a warm - up , let us see how such arguments can be used in the context of einstein causality , temporarily relaxing our assertion of this property as an axiom .    for @xmath33 ,",
    "let @xmath57 be the set of ordered pairs of spacelike separated open globally hyperbolic subsets of @xmath9 .",
    "for any such pair @xmath58 , let @xmath59 be true if @xmath60 and @xmath61 commute elementwise and false otherwise .",

    "moreover , any locally covariant theory @xmath146 , induces a family of theories @xmath147 which corresponds to applying the original theory @xmath20 to a frame - rotated version of the original spacetime .",
    "if we are to take seriously the idea that frame rotations of this type carry no physical significance then these theories should be equivalent .",
    "we formalise this in the following    [ ax : global ] to each @xmath148 , there exists an equivalence @xmath149 , such that @xmath150    the condition asserts that the equivalence implementing independence of global frame rotations intertwines the action of global gauge transformations",
    ". plausibly it might be relaxed ( or modified ) but it gives the cleanest results , so will be maintained for now .",
    "note that the equivalences @xmath151 are not specified beyond this requirement ; what is important is that they exist .",
    "obviously every theory induced from @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath152 , for some @xmath153 ) obeys axiom  [ ax : global ] , simply by taking @xmath151 to be the identity automorphism of @xmath20 .",
    "the assumptions above have a number of consequences  @xcite .",
    "first , the @xmath151 induce a @xmath154-cocycle of @xmath144 , taking values in the centre of the global gauge group @xmath155 , and given by @xmath156 furthermore , any other system of equivalences @xmath157 obeying determines an equivalent @xmath154-cocycle .",
    "we conclude that each theory @xmath146 obeying axiom  [ ax : global ] determines a group cohomology class @xmath158\\in h^2({{\\mathcal{l}}}^\\uparrow_+;{{\\mathcal{z}}}(\\operatorname{aut}({{\\mathscr{a}}})))$ ] in a canonical fashion .",
    "it is worth pausing to consider some sufficient conditions for @xmath158 $ ] to be trivial .",
    "this occurs , for instance , whenever @xmath20 is induced from a theory on @xmath3 , because we _ may _ take @xmath159 , giving @xmath160 , and any other choice gives an equivalent cohomologous @xmath154-cocycle .",
    "again , if @xmath20 has global gauge group with trivial centre , then @xmath161 has no choice but to be trivial .",
    "next , the _ scalar _ fields of the theory form a vector space @xmath162 carrying an action of both the gauge group @xmath163 and the proper orthochronous lorentz group @xmath144 @xmath164 these two actions commute , and turn out to obey @xmath165 which entails that irreducible subspaces of @xmath162 under the action of @xmath166 carry multiplier representations of @xmath144 , determined by @xmath161 .",
    "we deduce that the scalar fields form lorentz and gauge multiplets ( extending a result on gauge multiplets from  @xcite ) .",
    "further , all multiplets in which the multiplier representation is continuous ( at least near the identity ) must arise from _ true _ real linear representations of the covering group @xmath167 , and are therefore classified in the familiar way by pairs @xmath168 where @xmath169 are integer or half - integer spins .",
    "accordingly our analysis has led to an emergent understanding of spin , and answers the question of why this is an appropriate physical notion in curved spacetimes .    in certain cases ,",
    "we may say more immediately .",
    "any theory induced from @xmath3 , or in which @xmath155 is trivial , can only support fields of integer - spin , because @xmath158 $ ] is trivial .",
    "similarly , all multiplets of observable fields are of integer spin , because @xmath161 is a global gauge transformation , and therefore acts trivially on such fields .",
    "it seems remarkable that so much can be extracted from the single axiom  [ ax : global ] , without the need to specify what the equivalences @xmath151 actually are . in order to prove the spin - statistics connection , however , it is convenient to be a bit more specific , and to connect them to dynamics",

    "the bfv paper @xcite is subtitled ` a new paradigm for local quantum physics ' , and indeed their paper marked the beginnings of a full development of a model - independent account of qft in cst , the current state of which is described in more detail in  @xcite . at the heart of this approach",
    "is the fact that local covariance is a surprisingly rigid structure , which makes it possible to transfer certain results from the flat spacetime situation into general curved spacetimes in a fairly systematic way .",
    "this is a consequence of the timeslice property and also the structure of the categories @xmath3 and @xmath112 .    in this contribution ,",
    "i have focussed particularly on the spin - statistics connection , which was one of the starting points for the general theory .",
    "i have described a new viewpoint , based on framed spacetimes , that gives a more operational starting point for the discussion of spin in locally covariant qft , without making reference to unobservable geometric structures such as spin bundles . instead , by recognizing that we make physical measurements using frames , and by tracking the concomitant redundancies ,",
    "we are led naturally to a description that allows for spin . in our discussion , the relative cauchy evolution , which plays an important role in locally covariant physics on @xmath3 , is developed further so as to cater for deformation of the framing , rather than just of the metric .",
    "certain issues remain to be understood .",
    "our view of statistics has focussed on graded commutativity at spacelike separation ; it is not currently clear how to make contact with the occurrence of braid statistics in low dimensions .",
    "the coframed spacetimes we consider are necessarily parallelizable ; while this is not a restriction in four spacetime dimensions , one could seek generalizations that accommodate nonparallelizable spacetimes of other dimensions .",
    "finally , neither the result described here , nor verch s result  @xcite , gives a direct proof of the spin - statistics connection in curved spacetime ; both rely on the classic results of minkowski space qft . now",
    "a proof is a proof , and perhaps one should not complain too much , because it may be that a direct argument would be considerably more involved than those we now have .",
    "nonetheless , arguments that provide more insight into the nature of the spin - statistics connection are still desirable and it is hoped that the more operational account of spin presented here can be a further step along that path .",
