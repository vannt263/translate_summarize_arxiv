    "temperature and polarization anisotropies in cmb provide very precise information of the physical processes in the early universe . however , recent new cmb data sets from the wmap ( bennett , et al .",
    "2003 ) , the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar ; kuo et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the cosmic background imager ( cbi ; mason et al .",
    "2003 ) have indicated a potential discrepancy between theory and observation at higher multipoles @xmath6 .",
    "the best - fit cosmological model to the wmap data predicts the power spectrum which shows appreciable departure from those observed in balloon and interferometer experiments .",
    "this discrepancy can not be explained by taking account of tuned standard cosmological parameters .",
    "one possible interpretation of an excess power at high multipoles is a manifestation of the re - scattering of cmb photons by hot electrons in clusters known as the sz effect ( sunyaev and zeldovich 1980 ) .",
    "although there can be no doubt that some contribution from the sz effect exists in the observed angular power spectrum , it has not yet been established conclusively that this is the only possible interpretation ( aghanim et al .",
    "2001 ) of the small scale power .",
    "indeed , the best value of the matter fluctuation amplitude to fit the excess power at high multipoles is near the upper end of the range of the values deduced by the other independent method ( bond et al . , 2002 ;",
    "komatsu and seljak 2002 ) . toward the solution of this bothersome problem",
    ", it has recently been reported that the bump feature in the primordial spectrum gives the better explanation for both cmb and the matter power spectra at small scales ( mathews et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous cosmological magnetic field generated before cmb last scattering epoch is also a possible candidate to reconcile the tension in such higher multipoles .",
    "it excites an alfven - wave mode in the baryon - photon plasma in the early universe and induces small rotational velocity perturbations .",
    "since the mode can survive on scales below those of the silk damping during recombination ( jedamzik et al .",
    ", 1998 ; subramanian et al . , 1998 ) , it could be a new source of the cmb anisotropies in such small scales .",
    "analytic expressions of temperature and polarization angular power spectra in rather larger angular scales ( @xmath7 ) based upon the thin lss approximation were derived for both vector and tensor modes ( mack et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "subramanian and barrow ( 2002 ) considered the vector perturbations in the opposite limit of smaller angular scales .",
    "too strong magnetic field in the early universe , however , has a possibility of conflicting with the cosmological observations currently available .",
    "the combination of those studies and current observations places a rough bound on the strength of primordial magnetic field @xmath8ng .    in order to compare the theoretical cmb anisotropies calculated by including a primordial magnetic field , with observations much more precisely",
    ", we need to perform numerical calculations of the fully linearized equations with the use of realistic recombination history of the universe .",
    "in particular , we first need to develop a numerical method to predict the theoretical spectrum for intermediate angular scales , in which the analytic approximation becomes inappropriate .",
    "the numerical study of only the scalar mode was introduced by koh and lee ( 2000 ) , and they discussed the sensitivity of cmb to the primordial magnetic field strength .",
    "lewis ( 2004 ) has recently shown the characteristic of a primordial magnetic field effect on cmb in vector and tensor modes , numerically . however , there is no systematic study to put constraint on parameters of primordial magnetic field by taking account of both scalar and vector modes simultaneously .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to explore more completely the effects of a primordial magnetic field on the cmb anisotropies , and to place a new limit on the field strength together with many other cosmological parameters using the mcmc method in the analysis numerically .",
    "the present calculation differs from all previous discussions in the following important ways .",
    "first , we take account of the effect of ionization ratio exactly without approximation .",
    "second , we consider the effect of scalar mode of magnetic field more precisely than the analysis of koh and lee ( 2000 ) by introducing the cutoff wave number physically consistent with the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) study of damping alfven wave ( jedamzik et al . , 1998 ;",
    "mack et al . ,",
    "the effect of scalar mode of primordial magnetic field changes the cmb power spectrum significantly at larger scales for @xmath9 ( koh and lee , 2000 ) , while the effect of vector mode , which we also consider in the present study , dominates at smaller scales .",
    "these effects are very crucial to quantitatively estimate the effects of magnetic field on the cmb power spectrum over a wide range of multipoles @xmath10 for various scales .",
    "third , it is for the first time to discuss the primordial magnetic field as a possible solution to remove the tension between theory and observation which exhibits in smaller angular scales of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "before recombination , thomson scattering between photons and electrons and coulomb interactions between electrons and baryons were sufficiently rapid that the photon - baryon system behaves as a single tightly coupled fluid .",
    "since the trajectory of plasma particles is bent by lorentz force in magnetic field , photons are indirectly influenced by the magnetic field through thomson scattering .",
    "let us consider the primordial magnetic field created at some moment during the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field is treated as a first order perturbation in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background cosmology . within the linear approximation",
    ", the magnetic field evolves as a stiff source , and therefore we can discard all back reactions from the mhd fluid onto the field itself . also we assume that the conductivity of the primordial plasma in the early universe is infinite before decoupling , which is a very good approximation at the epochs which we are interested in . on this assumption",
    "we can decouple the time evolution of the magnetic field from its spatial dependence @xmath11 for very large scale , where @xmath12 is the conformal time , @xmath13 is the spatial coordinate , and @xmath14 is the scale factor .",
    "we also assume that a background primordial magnetic field @xmath15 is statistically homogeneous , isotropic and random .",
    "for such a class of magnetic field , the power spectrum can be taken as a power - law @xmath16@xcite , where @xmath17 is the wave number in the fourier space , and @xmath3 is the power - law spectral index of the primordial magnetic field which can be either negative or positive .",
    "evaluating the two - point correlation function of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor of the vector mode , we can obtain the isotropic spectrum @xmath18 ^ 2   \\times\\left(k^{2n_b+3}_d+\\frac{n_b}{n_b+3}k^{2n_b+3}\\right),\\label{eq : pi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath19 to a very good approximation ( mack et al .",
    "2002 ) , where the vector mode lorentz force , @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the magnetic comoving mean - field amplitude obtained by smoothing over a gaussian sphere of comoving radius @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25mpc in this paper ) . in this equation @xmath26 is the cutoff wave number in the magnetic power spectrum defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hubble parameter in units of 100km / s / mpc ( jedamzik et al . 1998 ; mack et al .",
    "since the magnetic field source term @xmath29 depends on the magnetic field quadratically , the explicit time dependence of the magnetic stress is given by @xmath30 .",
    "also the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor of the scalar mode is @xmath31(koh and lee , 2000 ; mack et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the previous studies",
    "the ionization ratio in the early universe was assumed to be a step function of time , i.e. @xmath32 before lss and @xmath33 after that .",
    "however , we have to incorporate a correct recombination history in order to obtain more accurate theoretical result .",
    "we accomplish this by using a numerical program recfast ( seager et al .",
    "1999 ) in open use .",
    "thus we take account of the correct ionization ratio @xmath34 , and we can now rewrite @xmath35 .    combining einstein equations with the fluid equations ( ma and bertschinger 1995 , hu and white 1997 ) , we obtain evolution equations of scalar and vector perturbations .",
    "we evaluated the likelihood functions of wmap data ( verde et al . , 2003 ) in a wide range of parameters of stochastic magnetic field , @xmath36 and @xmath3 , with other cosmological parameters , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in flat universe models , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the baryon and cold dark matter densities , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the spectral index and the amplitude of primordial scalar fluctuation , and @xmath38 is the optical depth . to explore the parameter space , we make use of the markov chain technique ( lewis 2002 ) .",
    "we also take account of the sz effect in our analysis . for that , we follow an estimate of komatsu and seljak , with @xmath43 ( spergel et at . 2003",
    "; komatsu and seljak 2002 ) .",
    "note that , we consider linear perturbations in flat frw universe , but we do not consider the effect of gravity wave damping ( caprini and durrer , 2002 ) which would be relevant for the magnetic fields on super - horizon scales if they were generated before the epoch of bbn .",
    "although this might alter the original spectrum of primordial magnetic field by the time of lss in blue power - spectral indices @xmath44 ( caprini and durrer , 2002 ) , one can still allowed to represent the modified spectrum in running power - law index .",
    "our study confirms that the effect of not only the vector mode but the scalar mode magnetic field plays the important role in order to solve the potential discrepancy of the cmb anisotropies between theory and observation at higher multipoles .",
    "we show the result of our mcmc analysis with wmap data in the two parameter plane @xmath45 vs. @xmath3 in fig.[fig1 ] . although the higher @xmath10 data from cbi(mason et al . ,",
    "2003 ) , acbar(kuo et al . , 2004 ) , and others may constrain the magnetic field strongly , we did not include those data in the present analysis because they have too large error bars . therefore , the result is most sensitive to the wmap data points at 500@xmath46900 . shown in fig.[fig1 ] is the excluded region at 2@xmath47(95.4% ) c.l as bounded by the thick solid curve , but we could not find the lower boundary of the allowed region at the same 2@xmath47(95.4% ) c.l . note that we find a very shallow minimum of the reduced @xmath48 along the thick dashed line which is almost parallel to the upper 2@xmath47 boundary displayed as thick solid line is fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we can thus obtain the strength of primordial magnetic field @xmath493.9ng(2@xmath47 ) at 1mpc for the power - law spectral index @xmath50 .",
    "this upper limit is the most reliable and newest one to the primordial magnetic field because we consider all effects on the cmb anisotropies , i.e. the effect of ionization ratio , the sz effect , and the both scalar and vector mode effects of the magnetic field , for the first time , in the present estimate of @xmath51 and @xmath3 . in our numerical estimate of the magnetic field parameters , we continued the mcmc analysis until the other cosmological parameters converge well to the values listed in table 1",
    ". the inferred parameter values are not very different from those of spergel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but the important fact is that we can not find obvious degeneracies of magnetic field parameters with other cosmological parameters .",
    "we understand this for the following reasons .",
    "primordial magnetic field is constrained by the cutoff scale of damping alfven wave as indicated by eq.([eq : kd ] ) ( jedamzik et al .",
    "1998 ; mack et al .",
    "since the cutoff scale is small enough compared with the mulitpoles @xmath52 3000 for current available data which we are interested in , the manifestation of this effect is remarkably seen as a monotonically increasing contribution from both scalar and vector perturbations in the mulutipole region higher then @xmath53500 as far as @xmath493.9ng .",
    "this sensitivity of the cmb power spectrum to the primordial magnetic field differs completely from those to the other cosmological parameters , which helps resolve the degeneracies among them .",
    "there is , however , strong degeneracy between magnetic field strength @xmath51 and power spectral index @xmath3 . at this moment",
    ", we can not resolve this strong degeneracy , because the wmap data are constrained to lower @xmath54 900 .",
    "the cbi and acbar data are in an interesting higher multipole region , but the error bars are too larger to resolve the degeneracy",
    ". precise data for higher @xmath10 , where the effect of the primordial magnetic field is especially strong , are highly desirable .",
    "let us shortly discuss the consistency of our upper limit @xmath55 with the other observational constraint on the magnetic field of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "many astronomical observations indicate that the magnetic field strength in the present day cluster of galaxies is @xmath56 g . assuming isotropic collapse for cluster formation",
    ", one can straightforwardly estimate the magnetic field strength about @xmath57ng at the epoch of lss . if the field strength is extremely larger than this critical value @xmath58ng , we need some damping process , and if it is smaller than @xmath58ng , on the other hand , we need amplification process .",
    "we do not know any viable physical process of damping the magnetic field , but there are several amplification processes proposed in literature .",
    "we found wide allowed region in the two parameter plane ( @xmath59 ) in fig.[fig1 ] for the primordial magnetic field which best fits the current cmb data . their parameter values satisfy the observational constraint form the cluster of galaxies @xmath60ng at the epoch of lss .",
    "to summarize , we studied the cmb fluctuation power spectrum by taking account of the scalar and vector modes from primordial magnetic field and the sz effect .",
    "the likelihood analysis of the wmap data indicates that the upper limit of magnetic field strength is @xmath61 ng ( 2@xmath47 ) at 1 mpc for any power spectral indices @xmath3 and reasonable values of the other cosmological parameters .",
