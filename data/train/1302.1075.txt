    "in recent years , great interest has been focused on sno@xmath4 due to its importance in many technical fields , such as gas sensors,@xcite solar cells,@xcite and optoelectronic devices.@xcite the nominally undoped ( unintentional doped ) sno@xmath4 is a transparent metal - oxide semiconductor which is natively n - type and usually has a resistivity in the range of 1 - 100 @xmath5 cm.@xcite the optical transparency of sno@xmath4 thin films can be up to 97% in the visible range ( for films of thickness 0.1 - 1 @xmath6 m ) with a direct optical band gap of 3.6 - 4.2 ev.@xcite the conductivity of sno@xmath4 film can be greatly enhanced by doping small amount of fluorine , antimony , tantalum and other dopants.@xcite currently , fluorine doped sno@xmath4 ( fto ) film is one of the widely used transparent conducting oxide ( tco ) materials .",
    "in addition , the p - type conductivity , which is crucial in fabricating transparent p - n junction , was recently observed in li , in , al , and n doped sno@xmath4,@xcite which further stimulates the studies on sno@xmath4 materials .",
    "the influences of the fabricating method and fabricating condition on the structures , electrical transport and optical properties of sno@xmath0 films had been extensively investigated.@xcite the electrical transport properties of different forms of sno@xmath4 such as nanobelt , nanowire , and thin films had also been studied.@xcite however , the origins of electrical conductivity as well as the charge transport mechanisms of sno@xmath0 have not been fully understood , which seriously limits optimizing the properties of this material .",
    "thus detailed measurements of the temperature behavior of resistivities over a wide temperature range and then extracting the charge transport mechanisms in sno@xmath4 films are necessary and nontrivial .    in the present paper ,",
    "we systematically investigated the temperature dependence of resistivities from liquid helium temperatures to 380 k for seven polycrystalline sno@xmath4 films deposited by rf sputtering method at different oxygen partial pressures .",
    "( it is known that the carrier concentrations in sno@xmath4 films are seriously influenced by the oxygen contents . )",
    "the electrical transport process was found to be dominated by thermal activation and variable - range - hopping ( vrh ) processes at high and low temperatures , respectively .",
    "particularly , a transition from mott type to efros - shklovskii ( es ) type vrh conduction process was observed for all the samples .",
    "the variations in surface morphologies and optical properties with oxygen partial pressure for the films were also studied .",
    "the sno@xmath4 thin films were deposited on quartz glass by standard rf sputtering method . a sno@xmath4 target ( with diameter of 60 mm and 5 mm thick ) , synthesized by the traditional ceramic process ,",
    "was used as the sputtering source .",
    "sno@xmath4 powders with 99.9% purity were ground by ball milling for 12 h before being compressed into a disk .",
    "the disk was calcined at 1673 k in air for 12 h and then furnace cooled .",
    "the base pressure of the chamber was pumped to @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 pa and then a mixture gas of ar and o@xmath4 ( both were 99.999% purity ) was introduced as the sputtering gas .",
    "oxygen partial pressure ( @xmath10 ) was controlled ( 0 , 0.5% , 1% , 1.5% , 5% , 10% , and 20% ) by adjusting the flux ratio of ar to o@xmath4 and the pressure of chamber was maintained at 1 pa .",
    "the substrate temperature and the sputtering power were kept at 973 k and 150 w , respectively .",
    "film thickness ( @xmath1@xmath11 @xmath6 m ) was determined by a surface profiler ( dektak , 6 m ) .",
    "crystal structures of the films were measured in a powder x - ray diffractometer ( d / max-2500 , rigaku ) with cu @xmath12 radiation .",
    "the surface morphology of sno@xmath4 thin films was characterized by a scanning electron microscope ( sem , s-4800 , hitachi ) .",
    "the resistivity was measured by the standard four - probe technique .",
    "a keithley 236 unit and a keithley 2182a nano - voltmeter were used as the current source and voltmeter , respectively .",
    "the temperature environment was provided by a physical property measurement system ( ppms-6000 , quantum design ) .",
    "optical absorption and transmittance spectra were measured in a uv - vis - nir scanning spectrophotometer ( uv-3101 pc , shimadzu ) .",

    "figure  [ fig1-xrd ] shows the xrd patterns of the sno@xmath4 thin films deposited at different oxygen partial pressures .",
    "samples were numbered from 1 to 7 according to the oxygen partial pressures ( 0 , 0.5% , 1% , 1.5% , 5% , 10% , and 20% ) during deposition . comparing to the standard pdf card ( no . 41 - 1445 ) , one can know that the films have tetragonal rutile - type structure and there is no secondary phase .",
    "the lattice constants are @xmath13@xmath144.742 , @xmath15@xmath143.189 , and insensitive to the oxygen contents , while the preferred growth orientation varies with the variation in oxygen partial pressure .",
    "the strongest peak is from the diffraction of ( 002 ) plane for sample no .",
    "1 , while it becomes ( 200 ) plane for sample nos . 2 and 3 .",
    "for sample no .",
    "4 , the diffraction corresponding to the ( 101 ) plane is the strongest peak . with further increasing oxygen contents ,",
    "the relative intensity of ( 101 ) peak is obviously reduced and the relative intensity of ( 111 ) , ( 211 ) , and ( 112 ) peaks increased sharply .",
    "the different preferred growth orientations would lead to different surface texture of the films , which is important in improving the efficiency of solar cells.@xcite our results indicate that altering the oxygen partial pressure in the sputtering process is an effective way to tune the texture of sno@xmath0 films .",

    "[ fig3-t ] , we can see that all films exhibit relatively high transparencies in the visible range ( 390 - 780 nm ) . at a certain wave range of visible spectra",
    ", the transparency of the film enhances with increasing oxygen partial pressure .",
    "in addition , the absorption edge slightly shifts to shorter wavelength side with increasing oxygen content . since the relation between transmittance and absorption coefficient ( @xmath20 ) is @xmath17@xmath18@xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the thickness of the film ) , one can readily obtain the absorption coefficient versus photon energy @xmath23 from the data in fig .",

    "[ fig3-t ] shows the obtained @xmath31 value versus oxygen partial pressure .",
    "clearly , the optical band gap of the film increases with oxygen partial pressure which is in accordance with the blue shift of the absorption edge .",
    "the oxygen vacancies are often treated as the main reason for the opaque of sno@xmath4 thin films.@xcite thus , the enhancement in the transmittance and optical band gap of the films can be attributed to the reduction of oxygen vacancies with increasing oxygen partial pressure .",
    "figure  [ fig4-rhot ] shows the resistivities as functions of reciprocal temperature from 380 k down to liquid helium temperatures for four representative films , as indicated .",
    "inspection of this figure indicates that the resistivity increases with decreasing temperature over the entire measured temperature range which shows a typical semiconductor behavior in the electrical transport property . at a certain temperature ,",
