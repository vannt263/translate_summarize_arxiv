    "the role active galactic nuclei ( agn ) play in the evolution of their host galaxy remains an outstanding problem in theoretical astrophysics @xcite .",

    "this feedback is treated through the injection of thermal energy into the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , others actually include jets and outflows @xcite , and both contribute to achieve the necessary quenching to match with the observed luminosity functions .    observers still investigate the different impacts of jets and outflows on the host galaxy .",

    "herschel_-atlas @xcite and find that the far - infrared ( fir ) data are critical to calculating sfrs in agn , particularly in quasars where radiation from the accretion disk can contaminate calculations of the sfrs calculated from optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) data . once the fir data is incorporated into the sfr calculations , the group finds both that high redshift radio loud agn can have high star formation rates and that these bursts of star formation happen simultaneously with the growth of super massive black holes ( smbh ) .",
    "these results are in tension with the idea of universal agn quenching . similarly , @xcite study several hundred agn from the chandra deep field south and compare the sfrs , as determined from archived infrared data , finding higher sfrs in the radio - loud agn , concluding agn jets trigger star formation .",
    "the differences in sfrs between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars underscore the importance of understanding the feedback mechanisms on a smaller scale .    however , with all the restrictions inherent to cosmological simulations on large physical scales , many of the critical physical processes in agn feedback can not be resolved due to density , velocity , and related time scales and dynamic ranges .",
    "@xcite simulate agn jet feedback on a smaller , single - galaxy scale and show that mildly relativistic jets may induce star formation in their host galaxies .",
    "the discrepancy between the two approaches requires a closer look on smaller time and physical scales to treat the problem .",
    "@xcite also explore both positive and negative agn feedback from a theoretical perspective and identify the challenges of simulations .",
    "one such problem is the huge range of physical scales important to agn feedback , scaling from the pc size of the accretion disc , out to tens of kpc to the edges of the host galaxies , extending even further to mpc scales and interaction with the inter - galactic medium .",
    "covering these spatial scales with good resolution while simultaneously capturing the extreme velocities close to the speed of light is virtually impossible . additionally including self - gravity and detailed radiative processes",
    "would make this computationally prohibitive .",
    "it is important then to focus on specific aspects of agn feedback with a given suite of simulations . as an example , @xcite examine the feedback effect from the pressure confinement of a jet driven bubble on a disk radio galaxy , avoiding the computational costs of an actual jet by artificially introducing overpressure .",
    "this frees up computational power to include self gravity .",
    "they find the pressure causes an increased fragmentation of dense clouds in the host galaxy and subsequent increase in star formation ( positive feedback ) .",
    "another specific aspect of agn feedback that is not well understood is the impact of winds from expanding jet cocoons or outflow bubbles on dense clouds of gas on small scales ( i.e. cloud scales ) , though there is some observational evidence of this .",

    "we organize this paper as follows : in section 2 , we discuss some previous literature , in section 3 we describe our simulation setup , and in section 4 our results . in section 5 , we include our findings and conclude in section 6 .",
    "a large number of cloud - crushing simulations have been performed in the past ( of which we can only mention a selection ) , but few have employed values for the pressure , velocity , and density of the incoming shock wave that are realistic for agn feedback as well as some crucial physical processes .",

    "this is not possible when non - linear processes like gravitational collapse or cooling are included and have a significant impact .",

    "we seek to include both realistic agn wind parameters as well as gravity in order to probe whether or not a wind resulting from an agn jet cocoon or an agn wind bubble can cause the collapse of the ism s dense clouds of gas and form stars .",
    "few studies in the past have specifically focused on the impact of radio jet cocoons on a cloud of gas .",

    "they list three main phases of wind  cloud interaction , first described by @xcite . in the first phase , the blast wave overtakes and interacts with the cloud . in the second ,",
    "the cloud is compressed through ram pressure and possibly thermal pressure if the cloud is under - pressured with respect to the environment .",
    "this phase lasts for the cloud crushing time : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the cloud and wind densities , respectively , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the cloud radius , and @xmath10 the wind velocity . in the third phase , shocks from different sides of the cloud collide ,",

    "their cloud parameters are meant to resemble a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) .",
    "they show that with radiative cooling , the cooling time for the cloud is substantially shorter than both the cloud crushing time and the kelvin - helmholtz time : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cloud velocity .",
    "they simulate uniform gas distributions in the shape of a circle and an ellipse , and find that at the conclusion of both simulations , less than @xmath17 of the original cloud has mixed in with the ambient gas .",
    "this indicates the slow evaporation of the cloud under the conditions of a radio jet cocoon .",
    "they also find that the radiative cooling occurs quickly enough that most of the cloud collapses into dense filaments that are likely to form stars , agreeing with the scenario of jet induced star formation",
    ". however , self - gravity is not simulated , and star formation is not explicitly calculated .",
    "some simulations of shocks resulting from other astrophysical phenomena cover parameter spaces pertinent to agn feedback .",
    "for example , @xcite simulate a supernova shock wave passing over a small uniform spherical gas cloud and find that thermal conduction and radiative cooling are critical to cloud survival .",
    "they use two different scenarios , each with different velocities and temperatures , wind velocities of 250 and 430 km s@xmath0 , densities of 0.4 @xmath18 in both , and temperatures of @xmath19 and @xmath20 k. the sphere had a density of 1 @xmath18 and a temperature of @xmath21 k , while the ism had a density of 0.1 @xmath18 and a temperature of @xmath12 k. they show the importance of thermal conduction in suppressing destructive instabilities in the first case , though the cloud does expand and eventually evaporate . in the second case",
    "they show that the radiative cooling is pivotal to the formation of cold , dense clumps after the wind passes over the cloud .",
    "gravity is not included , and no star formation is calculated .    also relevant to agn feedback , @xcite explore shocks from starbursts on fractal clouds and uniform spheres alike and also conclude on the importance of radiative cooling .",
    "they use wind values of @xmath22 @xmath18 , @xmath23 cm s@xmath0 , @xmath24 k , and sphere values of @xmath25 pc , @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath18 , @xmath28 k. the maximum resolution is 0.13 pc .",
    "the winds form dense filamentary structures like those observed in starburst driven winds .",
    "they also find that radiative cooling is essential to the longer survival time of the clouds and filaments .",
    "the wind does not heat or accelerate radiative clouds as much as their adiabatic counterparts , decreasing the impact of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities and increasing the lifetime of the clouds and filaments .",
    "the geometry of the cloud does impact their results and the wind destroys less dense regions more quickly .",
    "while they indicate that self - gravity may cause the filaments to collapse , they do not include gravity or look at subsequent star formation in this study .",

    "the group simulates turbulent velocities 310 km s@xmath0 and winds of up to 300 km s@xmath0 , and include gravity .",
    "in the case of the shocked sphere , they employ a uniform density distribution for the cloud .",
    "the ism , which comprises the wind , has a density of @xmath40 @xmath18 and a temperature of either @xmath41 or 10@xmath42 k. they conclude that the pressure confinement of the shock wave increases the star formation rate and efficiency , i.e. that a higher fraction of the molecular gas is converted into stars .",
    "they also find that the pressure confinement decreases the sizes of the resulting star clusters , and that cloud rotation and shear against the ism is not important unless the shear velocity is substantially greater than the sound speed of the constraining ism .",

    ". to assign values that would match those of a dense clump , we wanted to have a central and outer density a few orders of magnitude greater than the ambient medium . to make collapse more difficult , we selected a ratio of central density to outer density to maximize the stability of the sphere , a value of 3 .",

    "as a jet cocoon or outflow bubble expands through the galaxy , some clouds will be struck with velocities of 3,000 km s@xmath0 while others , shielded by other clouds , will be struck with slower velocities of 1,000 km s@xmath0 or even 300 km s@xmath0 depending on the location .",
    "@xcite discusses the idea that positive and negative feedback can occur simultaneously within the same galaxy , depending on the size of the clouds being struck with shocks , that the larger clouds will collapse under the pressure and form stars while the smaller clumps will be blown away .",
    "since we did not change the cloud properties systematically in our study , we can not assess the impact of variations in the typical sizes clouds or cloud complexes , e.g. with redshift @xcite .",
    "we only vary the the winds striking the clouds , but we too find that simultaneous positive and negative feedback is possible in the same galaxy provided that the winds will depend on time and location within the galaxy .",
    "we also include gravity and have spatial resolutions that are much better than those achievable in galaxy wide simulations .",
    "we see that the star formation efficiency decreases with ram pressure .",
    "this is an interesting result that fits as a data point on the spectrum between negative and positive feedback , that agn feedback can trigger star formation , but at a possibly lower efficiency than would otherwise occur , depending on the parameters of the feedback .",
    "there is , however , another intricacy that might be relevant : if star formation is not entirely prevented by high ram pressures , the time scale for collapse and the formation of stars within a cloud should be much shorter and happen more synchronously rather than be spread over the ( long ) free - fall time of the uncompressed cloud or cloud complex .",
    "correspongingly , the impact of ( negative ) stellar feedback within the cloud by other young stars should be considerably smaller and thereby increase the efficiency of star formation .    among other interesting conclusions",
    ", @xcite found that that the wind destroyed regions of lower density faster than those of higher density .",
    "combined with our results in which the density of the core clumps can climb up to five orders of magnitude in @xmath11750 kyr , this would indicate that the clumps would survive for long periods of time .",
    "@xcite also found that radiative cooling increases the survival time of the clouds .",
    "the clouds in @xcite survive up to 1 myr , achieving velocities of 150400 km s@xmath0 , and it is reasonable to believe that our dense clumps could survive that long if they were not already collapsing .",
    "those velocities are higher than our clump velocities at the simulation s end , but that is to be expected because our simulations have maximum times of 250 kyr and because our clumps are much denser .",
    "the results from our simulations are similar to our previous studies , @xcite and @xcite , which show both that feedback in radio - loud galaxies may be positive and that stars formed during this period of feedback will have a positive velocity bias .",
    "specifically , these stars are typically formed with greater radial and vertical ( off the disk ) velocity distributions . while we found velocities of up to 35 km s@xmath0 within the simulated time span for our small cloud",
    ", we note that larger clouds might survive longer , would be accelerated to higher velocities due to the larger effective cross section and thus form stars with higher peculiar velocities .    in turn",
    ", this also provides further computational support to previously existing theory linking agn feedback with hypervelocity stars @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the cocoon or bow shock of a jet accelerates a pocket of gas to high velocities while compressing it to form stars .",
    "@xcite makes analytical arguments based on energy and momentum , but here we provide computational evidence to the same end . again , because our simulations are limited in the size of the cloud and the time with which we have to accelerate the cloud , we do not achieve stellar velocities as high as some of those observed in the milky way .",
    "however , what we show here is that the phenomenon is possible on smaller scales",
    ".    it would be interesting in the future to extend the simulations to larger gas complexes such as giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) .",
    "for these , the assumption of having be spheres is no longer suitable and a turbulent gmc would need to be included .",
    "this may address the idea that the larger the cloud is , the more positive the feedback could be .",
    "our simulations show that the unique combination and range of ram pressure and thermal pressure agn feedback provides can either trigger or prevent star formation in dense clumps within the ism , depending mostly on the ram pressure .",
    "our setup includes a broad range of parameters expected for winds originating from agn jet cocoons or quasar winds . in the simulations that form stars",
    ", the wind compresses the cloud in the high - pressure post - shock region , then followed by the simultaneous stripping and collapse of the sphere .",
    "the initial compression from the shock and not gravity causes the peak density in the sphere to climb by as much as 5 orders of magnitude in as little as 50 kyr , reaching regimes where gravitational collapse overcomes internal pressure and kinetic energy . during this phase , the free fall time of the cloud drops from 3 myr initially , to as low as 10 kyr in subsequent clumps .",
    "we analyze these clumps resulting from this collapse , and subsequent star formation within the clumps , finding indications of both positive and negative feedback , depending on the parameters of the wind .",
    "we find that the stratified density profile of bonnor  ebert spheres can have a considerable impact on gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "we find that increased ram pressure , momentum , and mach number of the incoming wind decreases the total mass of stars formed , but increases the velocities of these stars .",
    "furthermore , star formation would happen on a much shorter time scale and more synchronously .",
    "we identify threshold values for ram pressure and momentum of @xmath2 dyn @xmath3 above which star formation is not expected to occur because high internal velocities generated within the clumps support them against gravitational collapse long enough for the cloud to be destroyed .",
    "our results indicate that simultaneous positive and negative feedback will be possible in a single galaxy as agn wind parameters will vary with location within a galaxy .",
    "similar phenomena are observed in agn @xcite .",
