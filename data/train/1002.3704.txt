    "the dirty boson problem has become a central and fascinating subject in condensed matter physics starting from the first theoretical investigations more than 20 years ago  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between quantum degeneracy , interactions and quenched disorder in a bosonic system gives rise to a rich scenario that exhibits new and peculiar features compared to the much older problem of the metal / insulator transition with electrons  @xcite .",
    "an important difference is that bosons can not rely on the pauli pressure and repulsive interactions are crucial to avoid collapse in the lowest localized single - particle state . as a result perturbation schemes starting from the non - interacting model , that are most useful for fermions , are completely inappropriate in the case of bosons .",
    "theoretical investigations , including quantum monte carlo simulations , have mainly addressed the problem of bosons on a lattice with on site bound disorder , the so - called disordered bose - hubbard model . in this case",
    "commensurability , _",
    "i.e. _ the integer ratio of the number of particles to the number of lattice sites , plays a major role allowing for a superfluid / insulator ( of the mott type ) transition also in the absence of disorder that is purely driven by interaction effects .",
    "furthermore , depending on the value of the interaction strength , disorder can act in favor of superfluidity , by randomizing the insulating state close to the mott transition , or in opposition to it by localizing almost free particles into single - particle levels .",
    "the insulating phases occurring in the two regimes of strong and weak interactions are respectively often referred to as the bose glass , when interactions suppress superfluidity , and the anderson glass , when interactions compete with disorder enhancing superfluidity  @xcite .",
    "the disorder driven quantum phase transition occurring at @xmath1 has been investigated in a series of numerical studies both at incommensurate and commensurate densities and in various dimensionalities  @xcite .",
    "the picture emerging from these studies , together with the crucial role of interactions to stabilize the system , is that superfluidity is lost for strong enough disorder , leading to a gapless normal phase different from the incompressible mott insulator .",
    "random potentials in continuous systems have been considered using perturbative approaches based on the bogoliubov theory  @xcite .",
    "these methods are reliable when both interactions and disorder are weak and allow for the determination of the effect of disorder on the thermodynamic properties , including the fraction of atoms in the condensate , the superfluid density and other thermodynamic functions .",
    "exact numerical methods have also been applied both at zero  @xcite and at finite temperature  @xcite . in particular , the path - integral monte carlo simulations carried out at finite @xmath2 addressed the problem of the elementary excitations  @xcite and of the transition temperature  @xcite of a bose fluid in a random environment . in the case of the continuous - space liquid phase , disorder always acts against superfluidity , whereas interaction helps make the superfluid state more robust . for strong disorder and low temperatures",
    "one expects the system to enter an insulating phase ( bose glass ) that is smoothly connected with the high - temperature normal phase existing when the disorder is weak .    on the experimental side a large body of work was devoted to @xmath3he adsorbed in porous media , such as vycor glass and aerogels .",
    "these studies investigated the behavior of the heat capacity and of the superfluid response  @xcite , as well as the dynamic structure factor  @xcite as a function of temperature and filling . a suppression of the @xmath4 transition",
    "is observed and the critical coverage for the onset of superfluidity is determined as a function of temperature , however , no clear evidence is found of a compressible bose glass phase .",
    "more recently the dirty boson problem has been addressed using ultracold atoms , which offer unprecedented control and tunability of the disorder parameters and of the interaction strength .",
    "transport and phase - coherence properties of an interacting gas in disordered optical potentials are investigated and an insulating state is reached by increasing the strength of disorder  @xcite .",
    "a large experimental effort has also been devoted to the suppression of diffusion for non - interacting particles ( anderson localization )  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report on a path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) study of an interacting bose gas in the presence of correlated disorder produced by 3d optical speckles .",
    "this random potential is relevant for experiments and allows for an independent tuning of intensity and correlation length . by increasing the disorder strength",
    ", we find a sizable reduction of the superfluid transition temperature and the shift is larger for weaker interactions .",
    "we map out the normal to superfluid phase diagram , both in the chemical potential vs. disorder and in the density vs. disorder plane . for strong disorder and in the presence of small but finite interactions ,",
    "the critical chemical potential varies linearly with the disorder intensity and is essentially independent of temperature and interaction strength , in agreement with the existence of a mobility edge separating localized from extended states .",
    "we also find that the critical chemical potential is much larger than the classical percolation threshold for the same random potential , implying that a major role is played by quantum localization effects . in the regime of strong disorder and for chemical potentials below the critical value , the equilibrium state is a highly degenerate normal gas .",
    "we investigate the thermodynamic properties of this phase , finding a @xmath0 dependence of the equation of state in agreement with the peculiar feature expected for the bose glass phase .",
    "the effect of the disorder correlation length is discussed in detail and we show that a non - trivial behavior is obtained only when the correlation length is comparable with the mean interparticle distance . at @xmath1",
    "we also carry out calculations using the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation and at finite @xmath2 using a self - consistent mean - field approach based on hartree - fock theory and on the local density approximation .",
    "the results of the gp equation for the ground - state energy and the spatial distribution of particles are accurate even in the regime of strong disorder with short - range correlations .",
    "this conclusion might be useful in view of investigating the structural properties of the bose glass phase .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath5 identical bosons of mass @xmath6 , subject to the random field @xmath7 and interacting with a repulsive pairwise potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of the gas takes then the form : @xmath8 interatomic interactions are modeled using a hard - sphere potential : @xmath9 where the diameter @xmath10 coincides with the @xmath11-wave length of the two - body scattering problem .",

    "c ) for random potentials of large strength and with spatial correlations in the range @xmath255 , a window of temperatures opens up where the system is normal ( i.e. not superfluid ) , though highly degenerate ( @xmath256 ) .    the properties of the \" exotic  normal phase displayed at low temperatures for strong disorder are worth investigating .",
    "we find that the equation of state is well fitted by a quadratic temperature dependence as shown in figure  [ fig14 ] .",
    "this @xmath0-law for the energy , and consequently linear dependence of the specific heat , is a remarkable feature of the phase . in a clean superfluid , or in a dirty one with short - range disorder correlations",
    "( see figure  [ fig14 ] ) , the energy at low temperatures exhibits the @xmath257-law typical of the thermal excitation of phonons . in the opposite regime of long - range disorder correlations",
    "one can apply the hf - lda approach described in section  [ section5b ] , which is expected to become more and more accurate as @xmath26 increases . within this approach the system consists of large condensate lakes that may or",
    "may not be connected through a percolating path , the relevant excitations at low temperature are of single - particle nature and are localized at the boundary of the condensate lakes .",
    "these excitations contribute to the energy with a @xmath258-law independent of the value of the correlation length .",
    "however , for increasing @xmath26 , the range of temperatures where the asymptotic law applies is suppressed . ] .",
    "a bose glass is predicted to exhibit a non - vanishing density of states at zero energy@xcite , which results in a @xmath0-law for the low temperature equation of state .",
    "we interpret the quadratic dependence found in the low temperature normal phase as an evidence of the bose glass phase .",
    "another important output of pimc simulations with the random potential is the spatial particle distribution and the distribution of particles contributing to the condensate density . in figure  [ fig15 ]",
    "we show the results of the particle density @xmath234 for a given realization of the random potential . starting from a high temperature distribution spread over the entire system , as temperature",
    "is decreased , the density becomes more and more peaked in correspondence of the minima of the external potential . around @xmath259",
    "the system turns superfluid ( see figure  [ fig19 ] ) and the density changes only slightly down to the lowest temperatures . remarkably , the comparison with the findings of the gp equation for the same realization of the random field is rather good both for the position and the relative intensity of the peaks .",
    "the comparison between particle density and condensate density profiles is reported in figure  [ fig16 ] for two temperatures , above and below @xmath140 .",
    "the result at the lowest temperature shows that the condensate density follows the particle distribution , but does not exhibit its pronounced peaks . this behavior is clearly represented in figure  [ fig17 ] , where we show the profiles along a cut through the plane of figure  [ fig16 ] .",
    "notice that the particles contributing to the condensate are only a small fraction ( @xmath260 ) of the total number of particles ( see figure  [ fig19 ] ) .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig18 ] we report the density profiles as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "the figure clearly shows the effect of particle localization in the deepest wells of the random field as the value of the gas parameter is reduced .",
    "the behavior of the superfluid and condensate fraction in the proximity of the phase transition with and without disorder are shown in figure  [ fig19 ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice the large depletion of @xmath128 and @xmath127 even at the lowest temperatures and the fact that , in the regime of strong disorder , the superfluid component becomes significantly smaller than the condensate one .",
    "similar results are reported in figure  [ fig20 ] for a fixed temperature and for varying values of the interaction strength .",
    "the figure clearly shows that by making interactions weaker the system will eventually turn normal and that the difference between superfluid and condensate fraction disappears with strong enough interactions .    to complete the picture we would like to mention the limit of weak disorder @xmath261 and weak interactions @xmath262 considered in ref .",
    "it explains how interactions stabilize the superfluid phase starting from the localized phase of the non - interacting gas . at zero temperature the boundary between the insulating ( bose glass ) and superfluid phases",
    "is set ( up to logarithmic corrections ) by percolation at the larkin energy scale @xmath263 which has to be compared with the chemical potential of the weakly interacting gas @xmath264 .",
    "this leads to the relation for the critical density @xmath265 , _",
    "i.e. _ for small @xmath16 only a tiny density of particles is required to off - set the localization effects . in practice",
    ", one observes extremely robust superfluidity of the weakly - interacting bose gas even in the presence of relatively large disorder , see figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , [ fig19 ] , [ fig20 ] ; for @xmath266 the critical temperature is essentially the same as in the ideal bose gas .",
    "we find that in a quantum degenerate bosonic gas a random potential is most efficient in suppressing superfluidity if it is correlated over length scales comparable with the mean interparticle distance .",
    "however , for the typical diluteness conditions of ultracold gases , disorder intensities significantly larger than the energy scale @xmath267 set by the bec transition of the ideal gas are required for a significant reduction of the superfluid critical temperature and stronger interactions make the superfluid state more robust . in the regime of weak interactions and strong disorder ,",
    "the superfluid transition turns out to be well characterized by the existence of a mobility edge , separating localized from extended states , that is largely independent of temperature and interaction strength .",
    "this picture is similar to the percolation threshold of classical particles , but we find that quantum localization effects drive the system normal in a large region of energies where classical states would be extended .",
    "furthermore , most of the particles are localized in the deepest wells of the random potential and only a small proportion contributes to the extended condensate state .",
    "the effective density of these delocalized particles is much smoother due to the screening of the external field from the other particles and sets the critical density of superfluidity which however starts at significantly lower temperatures compared to clean systems . for",
    "larger disorder intensities an \" exotic  normal phase appears in the degenerate regime , even though we can not reach @xmath1 .",
    "this phase is characterized by a peculiar @xmath0 dependence of the equation of state , that is markedly different from the @xmath257 law of homogeneous superfluids and from the @xmath258 law found for large condensate lakes within lda and is in agreement with the predictions for the bose glass phase .",
