    "vzquez - semadeni  ( 1995 , hereafter paper  i ) and passot  ( 1995 , hereafter paper  ii ) have produced a numerical model of the interstellar medium ( ism ) including enough physical agents as to render it feasible to perform statistical studies of the clouds formed in the simulations .",
    "the simulations include self - gravity , magnetic fields , parameterized cooling and diffuse heating , the coriolis force , large - scale shear , and localized stellar energy input . in the present work , we discuss the virial theorem ( vt ) as it applies to the simulations , and present preliminary statistical results from a two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulation with a resolution of @xmath0 grid points , performed specifically for this analysis . in ",
    "ii we discuss the vt , applying the formalism developed by mckee &  zweibel ( 1992 ) to the 2d case . in ",
    "iii we describe the cloud - identifying algorithm and show preliminary statistical results , and in   iv we present some remarks and future work .",
    "-0.3 cm    the vt is obtained by dotting the momentum equation ( eq .",
    "( 1b ) in paper  i ) with the position vector * x * and integrating over volume .",
    "mckee &  zweibel ( 1992 ) have discussed an eulerian form of the vt , which is most appropriate for our simulations , since they are performed with an eulerian code . because the simulations are 2d ( in order to reach a sufficiently large resolution )",
    ", we must consider the vt in 2d as well .",
    "it reads :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the kinetic term , @xmath3 is the thermal term , @xmath4 is the magnetic term , @xmath5 is the gravitational term , @xmath6 is the coriolis term , @xmath7 is the flux of moment of inertia through the surface @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the density , velocity , thermal pressure and self - gravitational acceleration , respectively .",
    "because of two - dimensionality , we must replace volumes by areas and surfaces by contours in ( [ virial ] ) .",
    "however , we retain the above notation for generality .",
    "since in 2d @xmath13 , in equation ( [ virial ] ) we note the three following interesting points : _ a ) _ although magnetic fields are present in the surface term @xmath14 ( where the maxwell stress tensor is defined as @xmath15 $ ] ) , the  classical \" magnetic energy term @xmath16 does not enter the virial equation , so it does not provide support against gravity . _",
    "b ) _ the internal energy @xmath17 does not contain the 3/2 factor as in 3d .",
    "nevertheless , in 2d this term still coincides with the total internal energy , because there are only two translational degrees of freedom . _",
    "c ) _ additionally , it can be shown that the gravitational term @xmath18 does not coincide with the gravitational energy @xmath19 as it does in 3d for isolated clouds . essentially , this is due to the slower distance dependence of the gravitational potential in 2d .    -0.5",
    "-0.3 cm    # 1#21.03    -2 cm    in order to calculate the terms in equation ( [ virial ] ) , we have performed a 2d simulation similar to the one called `` run 28 '' in paper  ii , but with a resolution of @xmath20 grid points . in this run we analyze the data shortly after turning off star formation , in order to allow for the largest possible density gradients ( see , ballesteros - paredes & rodrguez 1997 , hereafter paper  iii ) while still retaining the structure induced by the stellar energy injection .",
    "we have developed a numerical algorithm to identify clouds and evaluate within them the various terms entering the vt , as well as their velocity dispersion and mean density .",
    "we define a cloud as a connected set of pixels whose densities are larger than an arbitrary threshold @xmath21 .",
    "previous calculations ( paper  iii ) have shown that the simulations exhibit similar scaling properties as those observed in real interstellar clouds ( larson 1981 ) , except for the density - size scaling relation , supporting the possibility that it may be the result of an observational effect ( see also larson 1981 , kegel 1989 , scalo 1990 ) . with this motivation",
    ", we have now performed evaluations of the various terms in the vt .",
    "we have the following preliminary results : 1.- both the second derivative of the moment of inertia and the last term in the equation ( [ virial ] ) are dominant in the overall virial balance ( fig . [ dominant - terms]a ) . 2.-comparing the remaining terms ,",
    "the turbulent terms are seen to dominate ( fig .",
    "[ dominant - terms]b ) . 3.-the surface terms ( which are often neglected under the assumption of vanishing fields outside the clouds ) are in general of magnitude comparable to that of the volumetric ones ( figs .",
    "[ dominant - terms]c and d ) .",
    "4.-the gravitational term is most important at large scales ( fig .",
    "[ dominant - terms]e ) .",
    "however , there are a few small ( low energy content ) clouds which have large values of the gravitational term",
    ". these may be the best candidates for collapse and star formation .",
    "their scarcity appears consistent with the low efficiency of star formation .",
    "5.-the magnetic term and the sum of the kinetic terms are proportional to each other ( fig .",
    "[ dominant - terms]f ) .",
    "this suggests there is equipartition between kinetic and magnetic modes , except for a constant factor , which may be due to the fact that clouds have bulk velocities with respect to the integration volume .    -2",
    "-0.3 cm    the dominance of the time - derivative and kinetic terms indicates the importance of flow through the volume boundaries , contrary to the cases considered by mckee &  zweibel ( 1992 ) . in order to minimize this effect",
    ", it appears necessary to consider eulerian volumes instantaneously at rest with respect to the center of mass of the clouds .",
    "however , preliminary attempts suggest that the flow through the boundaries can not be eliminated completely , since the clouds are extremely amorphous and change shape rapidly .",
    "this work will be reported in a future paper ( ballesteros - paredes &  1997 , in preparation ) ."
