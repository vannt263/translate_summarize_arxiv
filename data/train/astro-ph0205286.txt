    "most astrophysical systems , e.g. accretion disks , stellar winds , the interstellar medium ( ism ) and intercluster medium are turbulent with an embedded magnetic field that influences almost all of their properties .",
    "this turbulence which spans from km to many kpc ( see discussion in @xcite ) holds the key to many astrophysical processes ( e.g. , transport of mass and angular momentum , star formation , fragmentation of molecular clouds , heat and cosmic ray transport , magnetic reconnection ) .",
    "statistics of turbulence is also essential for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation foreground studies @xcite .",
    "all turbulent systems have one thing in common : they have a large  reynolds number \" ( @xmath1 ; l= the characteristic scale or driving scale of the system , v = the velocity difference over this scale , and @xmath2=viscosity ) , the ratio of the viscous drag time on the largest scales ( @xmath3 ) to the eddy turnover time of a parcel of gas ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "a similar parameter , the  magnetic reynolds number \" , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ; @xmath7=magnetic diffusion ) , is the ratio of the magnetic field decay time ( @xmath8 ) to the eddy turnover time ( @xmath4 )",
    ". the properties of the flows on all scales depend on @xmath9 and @xmath5 . flows with @xmath10 are laminar ; chaotic structures develop gradually as @xmath9 increases , and those with @xmath11 are appreciably less chaotic than those with @xmath12 . observed features such as star forming clouds and accretion disks are very chaotic with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "let us start by considering incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence , which can be described by the kolmogorov theory @xcite .",
    "suppose that we excite fluid motions at a scale @xmath15 .",
    "we call this scale the _ energy injection scale _ or the _ largest energy containing eddy scale_. for instance , an obstacle in a flow excites motions on scales of the order of its size . then the energy injected at the scale @xmath15 cascades to progressively smaller and smaller scales at the eddy turnover rate , i.e. @xmath16 , with negligible energy losses along the cascade .. ] ultimately , the energy reaches the molecular dissipation scale @xmath17 , i.e. the scale where the local @xmath18 , and is dissipated there .",
    "the scales between @xmath15 and @xmath17 are called the _ inertial range _ and it typically covers many decades .",
    "the motions over the inertial range are _ self - similar _ and this provides tremendous advantages for theoretical description .",
    "the beauty of the kolmogorov theory is that it does provide a simple scaling for hydrodynamic motions .",
    "if the velocity at a scale @xmath19 from the inertial range is @xmath20 , the kolmogorov theory states that the kinetic energy ( @xmath21 as the density is constant ) is transferred to next scale within one eddy turnover time ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus within the kolmogorov theory the energy transfer rate ( @xmath23 ) is scale - independent , @xmath24 and we get the famous kolmogorov scaling @xmath25    the one - dimensional , which , for isotropic turbulence , is given by @xmath26 .",

    "since @xmath33 , kolmogorov scaling implies @xmath34    kolmogorov scalings were the first major advance in the theory of incompressible turbulence .",
    "they have led to numerous applications in different branches of science ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , astrophysical fluids are magnetized and the a dynamically important magnetic field should interfere with eddy motions .    paradoxically , astrophysical measurements are consistent with kolmogorov spectra ( see lpe02 @xcite ) . for instance",

    "is this a coincidence ?",
    "what properties is the magnetized compressible ism expected to have ?",
    "we will deal with these questions , and some related issues , below .",
    "our approach here is complementary to that in vazquez - semadeni ( this volume ) and mac low ( this volume ) .",
    "these reviews discuss attempts to simulate the turbulent ism in all its complexity by including many physical processes ( e.g. heating , cooling , self - gravity ) simultaneously .",
    "this provides a possibility of comparing observations and simulations ( see review by ostriker , this volume ) .",
    "the disadvantage is that such simulations can not distinguish between the consequences of different processes .",
    "note , that in studies of turbulence the adaptive mesh does not help as the fine structures emerge through the entire computational volume .",
    "here we discuss a focused approach which aims at obtaining a clear understanding on the fundamental level , and considering physically relevant complications later .",
    "the creative synthesis of both approaches is the way , we think , that studies of astrophysical turbulence should proceed . certainly an understanding of mhd turbulence in the most ideal terms is a necessary precursor to understanding the complications posed by more realistic physics and numerical effects . for review of general properties of mhd ,",

    "4 we discuss testing and extending of the goldreich - sridhar theory of turbulence , then in  5 we deal with viscous damping of incompressible turbulence and describe a new regime of mhd turbulence that is present below the viscous cut - off scale .",
    "we move to the effects of compressibility in  6 and discuss implications of our new understanding of mhd turbulence for the problems of dust motion , cosmic ray dynamics , support of molecular clouds , heating of ism etc in  7 .",
    "we propose observational testing of our results in  8 and present the summary in  9 .",
    "kolmogorov turbulence is the simplest possible model of turbulence .",
    "since it is incompressible and not magnetized , it is completely specified by its velocity spectrum . if a passive scalar field , like `` dye particles '' or temperature inhomogeneities , is subjected to kolmogorov turbulence , the resulting spectrum of the passive scalar density is also kolmogorov ( see @xcite ) . in compressible and magnetized turbulence",
    "this is no longer true , and a complete characterization of the turbulence requires not only a study of the velocity statistics but also the statistics of density and magnetic fluctuations .    direct studies of turbulence have been done mostly for interstellar medium and for the solar wind . while for the solar wind _ in - situ _ measurements are possible , studies of interstellar turbulence require inverse techniques to interpret the observational data .",
    "attempts to study interstellar turbulence with statistical tools date as far back as the 1950s @xcite and various directions of research achieved various degree of success ( see reviews by @xcite ) .      solar wind ( see review @xcite ) studies allow pointwise statistics to be measured directly using spacecrafts .",
    "these studies are the closest counterpart of laboratory measurements .",
    "the solar wind flows nearly radially away from the sun , at up to about 700 km / s .",
    "this is much faster than both spacecraft motions and the alfvn speed .",
    "therefore , the turbulence is `` frozen '' and the fluctuations at frequency @xmath39 are directly related to fluctuations at the scale @xmath28 in the direction of the wind , as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the solar wind velocity @xcite .",
    "usually two types of solar wind are distinguished , one being the fast wind which originates in coronal holes , and the slower bursty wind . both of them show , however , @xmath42 scaling on small scales .",
    "the turbulence is strongly anisotropic ( see @xcite ) with the ratio of power in motions perpendicular to the magnetic field to those parallel to the magnetic field being around 30 .",
    "the intermittency of the solar wind turbulence is very similar to the intermittency observed in hydrodynamic flows @xcite .",
    "studies of turbulence statistics of ionized media ( see @xcite ) have provided information on the statistics of plasma density at scales @xmath43-@xmath44  cm .",
    "this was based on a clear understanding of processes of scintillations and scattering achieved by theorists ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a peculiar feature of the measured spectrum ( see @xcite ) is the absence of the slope change at the scale at which the viscosity by neutrals becomes important .",
    "scintillation measurements are the most reliable data in the `` big power law '' plot in armstrong et al .",
    "however there are intrinsic limitations to the scintillations technique due to the limited number of sampling directions , its relevance only to ionized gas at extremely small scales , and the impossibility of getting velocity ( the most important ! ) statistics directly . therefore with the data one faces the problem of distinguishing actual turbulence from static density structures .",
    "moreover , the scintillation data does not provide the index of turbulence directly , but only shows that the data are consistent with kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "whether the ( 3d ) index can be -4 instead of -11/3 is still a subject of intense debate @xcite . in physical terms",
    "the former corresponds to the superposition of random shocks rather than eddies .",
    "additional information on the electron density is contained in the faraday rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources ( see @xcite ) . however , there is so far no reliable way to disentangle contributions of the magnetic field and the density to the signal .",
    "we feel that those measurements may give us the magnetic field statistics when we know the statistics of electron density better .",
    "spectral line data cubes are unique sources of information on interstellar turbulence .",
    "doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on the turbulent velocity field which is otherwise difficult to obtain .",
    "moreover , the statistical samples are extremely rich and not limited to discrete directions . in addition",
    ", line emission allows us to study turbulence at large scales , comparable to the scales of star formation and energy injection .    however , the problem of separating velocity and density fluctuations within hi data cubes is far from trivial @xcite .",
    "the analytical description of the emissivity statistics of channel maps ( velocity slices ) in lazarian & pogosyan @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) shows that the relative contribution of the density and velocity fluctuations depends on the thickness of the velocity slice . in particular",
    ", the power - law asymptote of the emissivity fluctuations changes when the dispersion of the velocity at the scale under study becomes of the order of the velocity slice thickness ( the integrated width of the channel map ) .",
    "these results are the foundation of the velocity - channel analysis ( vca ) technique which provides velocity and density statistics using spectral line data cubes .",
    "the vca has been successfully tested using data cubes obtained via compressible magnetohydrodynamic simulations and has been applied to galactic and small magellanic cloud atomic hydrogen ( hi ) data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of absorption effects @xcite has increased the power of this technique .",
    "finally , the vca can be applied to different species ( co , h@xmath45 etc . ) which should further increase its utility in the future .    within the present discussion",
    "a number of results obtained with the vca are important .",
    "first of all , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) hi data exhibit a kolmogorov - type spectrum for velocity and hi density from the smallest resolvable scale of 40  pc to the scale of the smc itself , i.e. 4  kpc .",
    "similar conclusions can be inferred from the galactic data @xcite for scales of dozens of parsecs , although the analysis has not been done systematically .",
    "deshpande et al .",
    "@xcite studied absorption of hi on small scales toward cas a and cygnus a. within the vca their results can be interpreted as implying that on scales less than 1  pc the hi velocity is suppressed by ambipolar drag and the spectrum of density fluctuations is shallow @xmath46 . such a spectrum @xcite can account for the small scale structure of hi observed in absorption .",
    "magnetic field statistics are the most poorly constrained aspect of ism turbulence .",
    "the polarization of starlight and of the far - infrared radiation ( fir ) from aligned dust grains is affected by the ambient magnetic fields .",
    "assuming that dust grains are always aligned with their longer axes perpendicular to magnetic field ( see the review @xcite ) , one gets the 2d distribution of the magnetic field directions in the sky . note that the alignment is a highly non - linear process in terms of the magnetic field and",
    "therefore the magnetic field strength is not available .",
    "the statistics of starlight polarization ( see @xcite ) is rather rich for the galactic plane and it allows to establish the spectrum @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a two dimensional wave vector describing the fluctuations over sky patch .. for sufficiently small areas of the sky analyzed the multipole analysis results coincide with the fourier analysis . ] for uniformly sampled turbulence it follows from lazarian & shutenkov @xcite that @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the critical angular size of fluctuations which is proportional to the ratio of the injection energy scale to the size of the turbulent system along the line of sight . for kolmogorov turbulence @xmath54 .",
    "however , the real observations do not uniformly sample turbulence .",
    "many more close stars are present compared to the distant ones . thus the intermediate slops are expected .",
    "indeed , cho & lazarian @xcite showed through direct simulations that the slope obtained in @xcite is compatible with the underlying kolmogorov turbulence . at the moment fir polarimetry",
    "does not provide maps that are really suitable to study turbulence statistics .",
    "this should change soon when polarimetry becomes possible using the airborne sofia observatory . a better understanding of grain alignment ( see @xcite ) is required to interpret the molecular cloud magnetic data where some of the dust is known not to be aligned ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another way to get magnetic field statistics is to use synchrotron emission .",
    "both polarization and intensity data can be used .",
    "the angular correlation of polarization data @xcite shows the power - law spectrum @xmath55 and we believe that the interpretation of it is similar to that of starlight polarization .",
    "indeed , faraday depolarization limits the depth of the sampled region .",
    "the intensity fluctuations were studied in @xcite with rather poor initial data and the results were inconclusive .",
    "cho & lazarian @xcite interpreted the fluctuations of synchrotron emissivity @xcite in terms of turbulence with kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "here we consider mainly kolmogorov - type theories .",
    "other theories not discussed in this section include the eddy - damped quasinormal markovian ( edqnm ) approximation @xcite , the renormalization group technique @xcite , and the direct interaction approximation @xcite .",
    "attempts to describe magnetic turbulence statistics were made by iroshnikov @xcite and kraichnan @xcite .",
    "their model of turbulence ( ik theory ) is isotropic in spite of the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "we can understand the ik theory as follows . for simplicity ,",
    "let us suppose that a uniform external magnetic field ( @xmath56 ) is present . in the incompressible limit , any magnetic perturbation propagates _ along _ the magnetic field line . to the first order , the speed of propagation is constant and equal to the alfvn speed @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the density . since wave packets are moving along the magnetic field line , there are two possible directions for propagation .",
    "if all the wave packets are moving in one direction , then they are stable to nonlinear order@xcite . therefore , in order to initiate turbulence , there must be opposite - traveling wave packets and the energy cascade occurs only when they collide .",
    "the ik theory starts from this observation .",
    "the ik theory assumes that , when two opposite - traveling wave packets of size @xmath19 collide , they lose the following amount of energy to smaller scales : @xmath59 where the ik theory assumes that only collisions between similar size packets are important and @xmath60 .",
    "the latter means that the duration of the collision is the size of the wave packet divided by the speed of the wave packets .",
    "these assumptions look reasonable at first .",
    "but , it is important to note that they fail when eddies are anisotropic .",
    "that is , if eddies are elongated along the magnetic field line , then @xmath61 is not @xmath62 , but @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the parallel size of the wave packet ( or ` eddy ' ) .    equation ( [ deltae ] ) tells us that the energy change per collision is @xmath65 , which is only a tiny fraction of @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , in order for the eddy to transfer all the energy to small eddies , the eddy must go through many collisions .",
    "when such collisions are incoherent , we require a total @xmath68 collisions to complete the cascade .",
    "this means that the energy cascade time @xmath69 is @xmath70 which means that this new cascade time is @xmath71 times longer than the eddy turnover time ( @xmath22 ) . as in the kolmogorov theory",
    ", the ik theory assumes the constancy of energy cascade ( eq .",
    "[ scale_indep ] ) : @xmath72 which , in turn , yields @xmath73 or , @xmath74      a uniform component to the magnetic field defines a special direction , which will be reflected in the dynamics of turbulent fluctuations .",
    "one obvious effect is that it is easy to mix field lines in directions perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field and much more difficult to bend them .",
    "the ik theory assumes isotropy of the energy cascade in fourier space , an assumption which has attracted severe criticism @xcite .",
    "mathematically , anisotropy manifests itself in the resonant conditions for 3-wave interactions : @xmath75 where @xmath76 s are wavevectors and @xmath77 s are wave frequencies .",
    "the first condition is a statement of wave momentum conservation and the second is a statement of energy conservation .",
    "alfvn waves satisfy the dispersion relation : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the component of wavevector parallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "since only opposite - traveling wave packets interact , @xmath80 and @xmath81 must have opposite signs . then from equations ( [ k123 ] ) and ( [ w123 ] ) ,",
    "either @xmath82 or @xmath83 must be equal to 0 and @xmath84 must be equal to the nonzero initial parallel wavenumber .",
    "that is , zero frequency modes are essential for energy transfer @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the wavevector space , 3-wave interactions produce an energy cascade which is strictly perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "however , in real turbulence , equation ( [ w123 ] ) does not need to be satisfied exactly , but only to within an an error of order @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the energy cascade is not strictly perpendicular to @xmath56 , although clearly very anisotropic .",
    "it is noteworthy that there has been a claim that `` by increasing the magnitude of the mean field in 3-d simulations one finds that the transition from the isotropic 3-d scaling properties toward those observed in 2-d '' @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for recent development in 2-d mhd turbulence ) .",
    "this claim has yet to be substantiated , however .",
    "we feel that the available numerical simulations @xcite are reasonably consistent with the goldreich & sridhar @xcite model that we review in the next section .",
    "it is also worth noting that the idea of an anisotropic ( perpendicular ) cascade has been incorporated into the framework of the reduced mhd approximation @xcite .",
    "we assume throughout this discussion that the rms turbulent velocity at the energy injection scale is comparable to the alfvn speed of the mean field and consider only scales below the energy injection scale .",
    "consequently , we are not concerned with the problem of magnetic field generation , or the magnetic dynamo which is considered elsewhere in this volume(see also @xcite for reviews , @xcite for numerical calculations , @xcite for suppression of the @xmath86 dynamo effect in highly conducting fluids , and @xcite for recent developments ) .",
    "an ingenious model very similar in its beauty and simplicity to the kolmogorov model has been proposed by goldreich & sridhar @xcite ( 1995 ; hereinafter gs95 ) for incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "they pointed out that motions perpendicular to the magnetic field lines mix them on a hydrodynamic time scale , i.e. at a rate @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the wavevector component perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field and @xmath89 . these mixing motions couple to the wave - like motions parallel to magnetic field giving a _ critical balance _ condition @xmath90 where @xmath79 is the component of the wavevector parallel to the local magnetic field .",
    "when the typical @xmath79 on a scale @xmath88 falls below this limit , the magnetic field tension is too weak to affect the dynamics and the turbulence evolves hydrodynamically , in the direction of increasing isotropy in phase space .",
    "this quickly raises the value of @xmath79 . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath79 is large , the magnetic field tension dominates , the error @xmath91 in the matching conditions is reduced , and the nonlinear cascade is largely in the @xmath88 direction , which restores the critical balance .",
    "if conservation of energy in the turbulent cascade applies locally in phase space then the energy cascade rate ( @xmath92 ) is constant ( eq .",
    "[ scale_indep ] ) : @xmath93 combining this with the critical balance condition we obtain ananisotropy that increases with decreasing scale @xmath94 and a kolmogorov - like spectrum for perpendicular motions @xmath95 which is not surprising since the magnetic field does not influence motions that do not bend it . at the same time , the scale - dependent anisotropy reflects the fact that it is more difficult for the weaker , smaller eddies to bend the magnetic field .",
    "gs95 shows the duality of motions in mhd turbulence .",
    "those perpendicular to the mean magnetic field are essentially eddies , while those parallel to magnetic field are waves .",
    "the critical balance condition couples these two types of motions .",
    "let us reconsider the interaction of two wave packets moving oppositely along the mean magnetic field line .",
    "as in equation ( [ deltae ] ) , the energy loss per collision is @xmath96 where we explicitly distinguish the parallel ( @xmath64 ) and the perpendicular size ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the eddy is @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of @xmath99 to @xmath100 , @xmath101 characterizes the strength of the nonlinear interaction @xcite . in the gs95 theory ,",
    "this means that @xmath103 is required at the energy injection scale when energy injection is isotropic ( @xmath104 ) . when this condition is satisfied , the turbulence is called _ strong _ turbulence .",
    "there are some astrophysical situations , e.g.  the jovian magnetosphere @xcite , where the parameter @xmath105 is much smaller than the unity over a broad range of length scales .",
    "although as noted above the cascade will evolve in the direction of increasing @xmath106 for decreasing @xmath19 , and may reach the strong turbulent regime on very small scales . in this regime , the parallel cascade",
    "is strongly suppressed so the turbulence is qualitatively different from the strong turbulence discussed above .",

    "this model does not include information about the range of field strengths or velocities with structure on a scale @xmath19 in the bulk of the volume , aside from assuming that they are sufficiently weak that they do not contribute to any global averages .",
    "the second new fundamental parameter in this model is the eddy turn over rate at the damping scale , @xmath193 , i.e. @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the velocity at @xmath196 and @xmath197 is the viscosity of the plasma due to neutral particles , which differs from the viscosity of neutral fluid by the ratio of atomic to total densities .",
    "since motions on smaller scales are strongly damped , the cascade of magnetic energy to smaller scales is due to motions on the damping scale .",
    "this implies that @xmath198 so that @xmath127 is maintained approximately at the level of magnetic field at the damping scale , @xmath199 .",
    "this folding and refolding , perpendicular to the mean field direction , has a weak effect on the field line curvature .",
    "( this result is also seen in the simulations . )",
    "the decrease in the structure length @xmath19 is due to an increase in the magnetic field gradient perpendicular to the mean field direction .",
    "the resulting magnetic pressure gradients are balanced by plasma pressure gradients .",
    "thus on the scales below the viscous cutoff , the tension forces are balanced by viscous drag , i.e. @xmath200 \\hat b_l . \\label{e2}\\ ] ]    finally , this dynamic equilibrium can be maintained only if the small scale motions are strong enough to counteract the shear , @xmath201 .",

    "these scaling laws are at least qualitatively consistent with the simulation results , although the velocity power spectrum may be slightly steeper than the model prediction .",
    "unfortunately , a realistic treatment of the ism requires an explicit recognition of the two fluid nature of the partially ionized plasma , rather than simply representing neutral drag with an effective viscosity .",
    "here we are beyond the reach of available simulations , and need to rely on an extension of the scaling arguments given above .",
    "first , at sufficiently small values of @xmath19 , the ambipolar diffusion time  ( @xmath206 ion - neutral collision time ) will become less than @xmath207 , and the magnetic pressure gradients will be supported entirely by the ionized particle pressure .",
    "this means that only a fraction , @xmath208 , of the energy will continue the cascade to smaller scales .",
    "next , for some ion - neutral collision time , @xmath209 , there will be some decoupling scale , @xmath210 , where @xmath211 at smaller scales the ions will be dragged through a more or less uniform neutral background .",
    "the argument above needs to be modified by replacing the viscous drag coefficient in equation ( [ e2 ] ) with the right hand side of equation ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath212 @xmath213    finally , at some sufficiently small scale the filling factor will rise to unity , and the gradients in the magnetic field will become strong enough that neutral drag can be ignored .",
    "these conditions are satisfied simultaneously when @xmath214 below this scale we expect to see a resumption of the turbulent cascade , now involving only the ionized component of the plasma , down to scales where plasma resistivity and viscosity finally dissipate the remaining energy .",
    "since the longest cascade time for this regime is @xmath215 , we expect this small scale turbulence to be intermittent , with a duty cycle @xmath216 .",
    "all the consequences of the new regime of the mhd turbulence have not yet been appreciated , but we expect that it will have a substantial impact on our understanding of the interstellar physics",

    "[ fig_new1]d shows the 2d genus as the function of @xmath2 for a gaussian distribution of densities ( completely symmetric curve ) , for mhd isothermal simulations with mach number @xmath02.5 .",

    "recently there have been significant advances in the field of mhd turbulence :    1 .",
    "the first self - consistent model ( gs95 ) of incompressible mhd turbulence that is supported by both numerical simulations and observations is now available .",
    "the major predictions of the model are scale - dependent anisotropy ( @xmath134 ) and a kolmogorov energy spectrum ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "there have been substantial advances in understanding compressible mhd .",
    "simulations of compressible mhd turbulence show that there is a weak coupling between alfvn waves and compressible mhd waves and that the alfvn modes follow the goldreich - sridhar scaling .",
    "fast modes , however , decouple and exhibit isotropy .",
    "contrary to general belief , in typical interstellar conditions , magnetic fields can have rich structures below the scale at which motions are damped by the viscosity created by neutral drag ( the ambipolar diffusion damping scale ) .",
