    "further , to what extent these mechanisms share universal features seems unclear .",
    "various different models aimed at reproducing , explaining , and predicting spatially extended motion in active suspensions have been proposed and investigated over the last decade .",

    "since the velocity and direction of motion of each individual self - propelled agent adjusts to the velocity and direction of its neighbours , numerical simulations based on such models exhibit behaviour in agreement with observed features of spatially extended correlated motion , flocking , or aggregation and alignment . however , the aggregation and alignment phenomena are _ prescribed _ through phenomenological interaction rules .",
    "it is therefore unreasonable to expect such models to provide insights regarding the mechanisms _ underlying _ these phenomena .",
    "a complimentary approach to modeling and understanding active suspensions is provided by agent - based models that do _ not _ include prescribed alignment rules or attractive forces but rather rely on mechanically motivated forces , such as volume exclusion forces penalizing particle overlap , frictional forces accounting for interaction with the surrounding solvent , and random forces accounting for thermal fluctuations and intrinsic noise due to the swimming mechanisms of individual agents .",
    "these interaction forces are usually combined with the assumption that the self - propelled agents have rod - like geometry .",

    "the agents are assumed to be immersed in an overdamped solvent modeled through stokes - type friction forces that act on each agent . however , none of these models accounts for pairwise hydrodynamic interactions between self - propelled agents . a recent experimental investigation by drescher et al .",

    "importantly , in agent - based models , where there is no explicit accounting for the suspending solvent , such pairwise dissipative interactions provide a simple means to account for hydrodynamic interactions between the agents .",
    "the inclusion of such pairwise dissipative forces in the dpd dumbbell model yields a novel model system to study the influence of hydrodynamic interaction forces in active suspensions .",

    "it was originally designed to explore hydrodynamic behavior in complex fluids , as discussed , for example , in a review article by moeendarbary et al .",

    "moreover , as groot and warren  @xcite explain , the use of soft - core interaction potentials in the dpd method allows for large integration timesteps and stable simulations , providing a significant speedup in comparison to md simulations with hard - core interaction potentials .",
    "while the dpd method has a number of other desirable properties , such as , for example , net - momentum conservation and galilean invariance ( see , for example , allen and schmid @xcite ) , the ability to produce hydrodynamic behaviour with computational efficiency also makes it a potentially powerful tool for the simulation of active suspensions . an active brownian point - particle model with supplemental dissipative dpd - type interactions",

    "while the model is potentially applicable to a wide range of self - propelled particle systems , the specific class of self - motile bacterial suspensions is considered as a modeling scenario .",

    "particular attention is placed on the influence of stokes - type friction forces and pairwise dissipative interactions on the behavior of the system along with limiting cases wherein either of the two dissipative forces dominates .",

    "the self - propulsion force @xmath79 : this non - pairwise entity acts on each agent and accounts for the motility of each agent @xmath44 contained in the active suspension .",
    "2 .   the stokes friction @xmath80 : this non - pairwise entity accounts for hydrodynamic forces exerted by the surrounding solvent , acting on each particle @xmath6 forming the aggregate agent @xmath44 in the active suspension .",

    "the pairwise dissipative interaction force @xmath83 : this pairwise entity accounts for dissipative hydrodynamic interaction forces distinct from those encompassed by non - pairwise stokes friction .",
    "since this force is proportional to velocity differences of interacting particle pairs , it formally resembles a lubrication force ( see , for example , kim and karrila  @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , the positive low wavenumber scaling of the cases with stokes friction is accompanied by a global maximum of the energy spectrum at intermediate wavenumbers around @xmath198 .",

    "for all three choices of @xmath73 , the energy spectra exhibit low wavenumber scalings that are significantly more sensitive to the area fraction than in the cases with stokes friction .",
    "in contrast , the high wavenumber range exhibits a scaling law similar to that arising in the cases with stokes friction , with @xmath193 . as @xmath89 and @xmath73 increase , the slope of the energy spectrum at low wavenumbers decreases .",
    "in particular , for @xmath201 , the slope at the low wavenumbers more strongly depends on @xmath89 than larger values of @xmath73 , as is evident from panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : espn02 ] .",
    "interestingly , while all energy spectra for @xmath113 show a low wavenumber scaling with a negative scaling exponent , as shown in panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : espn02 ] , the scaling exponent of the energy spectra for the other choices of @xmath73 changes from positive to negative with increasing @xmath89 .",
    "panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : espscale ] , provides the scaling exponents obtained from a least - squares fit of the energy spectra .",
    "these results further confirm that the pairwise friction parameter @xmath73 has a significant impact on the low wavenumber scaling of the normalized energy spectrum ; lower values of @xmath73 result in positive slopes and higher values of @xmath73 combined with high area fractions @xmath89 lead to negative low wavenumber scaling slopes , where @xmath207 appears to be the lower bound observed for the current combinations of parameters .    in agreement with the previously discussed vcf statistics and the representative snapshots of the velocity and vorticity fields , the case of zero stokes friction induces a distinct behaviour of the normalized energy spectrum @xmath187 . for low values of the pairwise friction parameter @xmath73 ,",
    "the low wavenumber slope of @xmath187 strongly depends on the area fraction @xmath89 , as shown in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : espn02 ] .",
    "increasing @xmath89 leads to a decrease in the slope of @xmath187 .",
    "further , increasing @xmath73 leads to a decrease in the slope at low wavenumbers of @xmath187 for all considered values of @xmath89 , as shown in panels ( a)(c ) of figure  [ fig : espscale ] .",
    "the observed decrease in the slope of the low and interemediate wavenumber range of @xmath187 is more prominent for large @xmath89 ; however , for the largest considered pairwise friction coefficient , namely @xmath208 , all normalized energy spectra @xmath187 possess a low wavenumber scaling with a negative scaling exponent @xmath185 , as shown in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : espscale ] .",
    "the behaviour of the normalized energy spectra @xmath187 point to the presence of different energy transfer mechanisms in the cases with and without stokes friction . as is apparent from figure  [ fig : espn01 ] , the energy spectra with stokes friction exhibit a global maximum at intermediate wavenumbers for all considered values of the area fraction and pairwise friction parameters .",
    "however , without stokes friction , the energy spectra exhibit a global maximum at intermediate wavenumbers only if both @xmath73 and @xmath89 are sufficiently small , as depicted in figure  [ fig : espn02 ] .",
    "in addition , for larger values of @xmath73 and @xmath89 , the normalized energy spectrum of systems without stokes friction decreases monotonically with increasing wavenumber and attains its global maximum at the smallest wavenumber shell @xmath209 .",
    "these results indicate that , in self - propelled agents without the effect of stokes friction ( that is , @xmath117 ) , the energy , after being injected at large wavenumbers cascades upwards to the smallest wavenumber shell , corresponding to the largest length scale in the system .",
    "this effect becomes more predominant as the influence of pairwise dissipative interactions and the area fraction increases .",
    "adding the effect of stokes friction results in the accumulation of the energy at an intermediate wavenumber , forming a peak in the normalized energy spectrum , irrespective of the value of @xmath73 or @xmath89 .",
    "the discussed behavior can be understood by considering the spectral distribution of the two different energy dissipation mechanisms .    *",
    "the energy dissipation due to the stokes friction is proportional to the ( constant ) stokes friction coefficient and the magnitude of the squared velocity , which is twice the ( dimensionless ) kinetic energy .",
    "consequently , from a spectral perspective , the dissipation due to stokes friction acts mainly on wavenumbers containing large amounts of kinetic energy , namely the low wavenumbers . in two - dimensional flow , stokes friction , or similar types of friction mechanisms , for example rayleigh friction , therefore remove energy on large scales , that is , low wavenumber components of the velocity field ( see , for example , boffetta and ecke @xcite ) .",
    "such dissipation mechanisms penalize the formation of spatially extended correlated structures in the velocity field . *",
    "the pairwise dissipative interactions depend on local velocity differences rather than on the magnitude of the velocity .",
    "heuristically , they are thus expected to remove energy at very small scales , allowing for spatially extended correlated motion if the system is not over - damped by dissipation due to stokes friction . for the limiting case of vanishing stokes friction , this explains the observed spatially extended correlated motion patterns .",
    "a system of self - propelled soft - core dumbbells interacting with dpd - type forces was studied . more particularly , the influences of agent concentration and two different friction mechanisms , namely pairwise dissipative interactions and stokes friction , on the statistics of the system were presented .",
    "the pairwise dissipative forces provide a simple model system for studying the influence of hydrodynamic interactions in active suspensions .",
    "high agent concentrations combined with dominant pairwise dissipative interactions and vanishing stokes friction result in dynamic particle aggregation and spatially extended correlated motions . the characteristic length scales of the spatial structures exceed the characteristic size of an individual agent and point at the presence of phenomena reminiscent of the upscale energy transfer and energy condensation phenomena observed in classical two - dimensional turbulent flows , as discussed , for example , by boffetta and ecke  @xcite .    for cases with stokes friction , the normalized energy spectra possess a small wavenumber scaling with positive scaling exponent and a peak at intermediate wavenumbers .",
    "in contrast , the cases with dominant pairwise dissipative interactions have low wavenumber scalings with negative scaling exponents , pointing at the presence of an accumulation of energy at large scales .",
    "since the formulation includes neither ad - hoc biological alignment and coordination rules nor attractive forces , the obtained results demonstrate the potential importance of pairwise dissipative interactions in the formation of spatially extended structures in active suspensions .",
    "further , the soft - core interaction potentials used in dpd afford numerical stability and efficiency , even at large integration timesteps .",
    "larger timesteps enable efficient and robust simulations , allowing for the consideration of scenarios more complex than would be possible otherwise .    at the present stage , only one simple form of pairwise dissipative hydrodynamic interactions has been considered .",
    "the investigation of different forms of such hydrodynamic interactions should be subject of future research .",
    "possible changes to the hydrodynamic interactions include modifying the weighting function   through changing the exponent with which @xmath23 enters the dpd interactions  .",
    "this possibility is discussed by pan et al .",
    "@xcite , fan et al .",
    "@xcite , fedosov et al .",
    "@xcite , and symeonidis et al .",
    "@xcite , with the goal of adapting bulk rheological properties like the viscosity or the schmidt number of a classical dpd fluid .",
    "alternatively , a generalization of @xmath23 might account for lubrication - type interactions .",
    "however , the asymptotic behavior of lubrication interactions as the separation distance vanishes can be expected to compromise part of the stability of the standard soft - core dpd method .",
