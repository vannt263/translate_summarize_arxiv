    "[ sec : intro ]    following a decade of attempts to directly image extrasolar giant planets with increasingly sensitive instruments and speckle suppression techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , several planetary systems have finally been found through high contrast imaging over the past few years .",
    "these discoveries have opened up an exciting new era of planetary science where the atmospheres of non - transiting extrasolar planets can be directly studied for the first time .",
    "five unambigious planets have been imaged orbiting two stars : one around the a5 star @xmath5  pic ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and four surrounding the a5 star hr  8799 ( @xcite ; @xcite).2  myr ) accreting giant planet orbiting the transition - disk star lkca  15 at @xmath21520  au , but a clear understanding of this system , including the mass of the companion , is still lacking .",
    "in addition to these objects , a handful of other planetary - mass companions have been found orbiting stars from hundreds ( e.g. , 1rxs  j16092105  b : @xcite ; gsc  0621400210  b : @xcite ) to thousands ( ross 458  c : @xcite , @xcite ; wd  0806 - 661  b : @xcite ) of au , but the formation mechanism of these enigmatic companions remains obscure ( e.g. , @xcite ) . ]",
    "the fact that all these planets orbit high - mass stars might at first suggest that giant planet formation is more efficient around massive stars , which is a well - established trend observed at smaller separations from radial velocity planet searches ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , high contrast imaging searches have mostly neglected low - mass stars . until recently there has been a scarcity of known nearby young m dwarfs , making it difficult to produce statistical comparisons of planet occurrence rates as a function of stellar mass . as a result , even though m dwarfs outnumber afgk stars by a factor of 23 in the solar neighborhood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , our understanding of planet formation is the weakest in this stellar mass regime .",
    "we are conducting a high contrast adaptive optics imaging survey of young m dwarfs with keck - ii and subaru to search for young giant planets and brown dwarfs and measure the frequency of giant planets orbiting low - mass stars .",
    "our targets are newly identified m dwarfs with ages @xmath6300  myr and distances @xmath730  pc which were selected based on elevated levels of x - ray and uv emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "compared to high - mass stars , m dwarfs present several advantages as targets for direct imaging .",
    "their higher space densities mean they are on average closer than more massive stars , so smaller physical separations can be probed . moreover , because m dwarfs are intrinsically faint , direct imaging can detect lower planet masses in the contrast - limited regime .",
    "this allows us to reach typical planet masses of a few  at separations of @xmath210  au , making our planets around low - mass stars ( palms ) survey one of the deepest direct imaging planet searches to date .",
    "the first discovery from our palms survey was an l0 substellar companion to the young m  dwarf 1rxs  j235133.3 + 312720 separated by @xmath2120  au ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we present the discovery of a 0@xmath02 companion to the young m3.0 star gj  3629 .",
    "@xcite identified gj  3629 as a young star based on its high fractional x - ray luminosity , which is comparable to members of the pleiades ( @xmath2125  myr ) and young moving groups ( 10100  myr ) .",
    "@xcite obtained a high resolution optical spectrum of gj  3629  a and did not detect li , thereby setting a lower limit to its age .",
    "based on these constraints they estimate an age of 25300  myr , which places our new companion gj  3629  b below the hydrogen burning minimum mass at the estimated distance of the system ( 22  @xmath3  3  pc ; section  [ sec : dist ] ) .",
    "[ sec : obsnirc2 ]    we imaged gj  3629 on 25 march 2011 ut with the near infrared camera  2 ( nirc2 ) in its narrow - field mode on keck - ii coupled with natural guide star adaptive optics ( ngs  ao ; @xcite ) .",
    "there were light cirrus clouds during the observations and the seeing was @xmath20@xmath06 as reported by the differential imaging motion monitor on cfht .",
    "we obtained three short dithered frames with the @xmath8 filter while reading out the central 512@xmath9512 pixels .",
    "gj  3629 was easily resolved into a @xmath2200  mas pair with a flux ratio of @xmath23  mag ( the diffraction limit in @xmath10 is @xmath255  mas ) .",
    "second - epoch observations were obtained on 3 march 2012 ut with keck - ii / nirc2 ( narrow - field ) and ngs  ao . humidity levels were near 100% most of night and there were several bouts of snow , but for about half an hour the humidity dropped and the sky was clear enough to observe gj  3629 in order to verify the companion was comoving with the primary .",
    "we imaged the system in dithered patterns with the @xmath4 filters ( figure  [ fig : contours ] ) , which are from the mauna kea observatory filter system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a summary of our observations are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the images were reduced in the standard fashion by removing bad pixels , subtracting dark frames , and dividing by normalized dome flats obtained at the start of the night .",
    "each image was north - aligned using the fits header keywords , taking into account the ao - detector offset ( + 0.7@xmath11 ) and the sky orientation on the detector ( + 0.252@xmath11 ) derived by @xcite .",
    "we computed astrometry and flux ratios by fitting an analytic model composed of three elliptical gaussians to each binary component as described in @xcite .",
    "we found that varying the number of gaussians in the input psf model ( two versus three ) resulted in systematic errors in the flux ratios of @xmath121% , so we incorporated this in our flux ratio uncertainty by adding it in quadrature with the measured random errors .",
    "no distortion correction was applied because the relative correction over @xmath220  pixels is negligible for our purposes . for the separation measurement",
    "we adopt the nirc2 plate scale of 9.952  @xmath3  0.002 mas pix@xmath13 derived by @xcite .",
    "the resulting astrometry and flux ratios are listed in table  [ tab : astrometry ] , where the quoted values and uncertainties represent the means and standard deviations of each data set .",
    "strehl ratios and full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) measurements of gj  3629  a were made with the publicly available idl routine ` nirc2strehl ` and are listed alongside the astrometry in table  [ tab : astrometry ] .",
    "[ sec : results ]      [ sec : dist ]    there is no parallax measurement for gj  3629  a but there are several distance estimates to the primary in the literature .",
    "gj  3629 is part of the @xmath14 sample of nearby stars ( @xmath720  pc ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and was assigned a spectrophotometric distance of 16.7  @xmath32.7  pc ( @xcite ) based on optical bandstrength - absolute magnitude relations .",
    "recently shkolnik et al .",
    "( 2012 , submitted ) measured parallaxes for 75 young ( @xmath6300  myr ) m - type stars with spectrophotometric distance estimates @xmath630  pc .",
    "they found that the photometric distances were typically underestimated by @xmath270% as a result of unresolved binarity and youthful overluminosity , which would place gj  3629  ab at @xmath228  pc .",
    "shkolnik et al .",
    "( 2012 , submitted ) also derive a distance estimate using the minimum ( 25  myr ) and maximum ( 300  myr ) age estimates of the system ( section  [ sec : age ] ) combined with the evolutionary models of @xcite , arriving at a value of 22  @xmath3  7  pc .",
    "other independent distance estimates for the system include photometric distances of 18@xmath15  pc and 22.2  @xmath3  5.6  pc by @xcite and @xcite , which were computed using color - absolute magnitude relations from field m dwarfs , and an estimate of 26  pc by @xcite using 1  gyr theoretical isochrones from @xcite . given this large range of distance estimates , we adopt a value of 22  @xmath3  3  pc for gj  3629  ab .",
    "the baseline of 11 months between our first and second epoch observations lets us easily distinguish whether the close companion is physically bound to the primary .",
    "figure  [ fig : tracks ] shows the expected relative motion of a stationary background object based on the proper and parallactic motion of gj  3629 . the gray 1- and 2-@xmath16 confidence intervals for the background tracks in figure  [ fig : tracks ]",
    "are based on monte carlo realizations incorporating uncertainties in the distance estimate , proper motion , and astrometry .",
    "the weighted mean of the second epoch astrometry from our four independent measurements ( one for each filter ) is 197.9  @xmath3  0.2  mas and 120.75  @xmath3  0.07@xmath11 .",
    "if the candidate companion was a distant background object then the expected separation ( 352  @xmath3  3  mas ) and position angle ( 100.8  @xmath3  0.9@xmath11 ) at the time of our second epoch observation would differ from the measured values by 51-@xmath16 and 22-@xmath16 , respectively , easily ruling out the background hypothesis.instead , our second epoch astrometry is much closer to the first epoch measurements , differing by 15.0  @xmath30.2  mas and 1.96  @xmath3  0.11@xmath11 .",
    "this difference is plausibly explained by orbital motion .",
    "while this rules out contamination from a stationary background object , there is a small ( but non - zero ) probability that the candidate companion is an unassociated star with coincident sky position and proper motion .",
    "we approach this problem in two ways : ( 1 ) by calculating the _ a priori _ probability of a chance alignment of a field ultracool dwarf regardless of any information about proper motions , and ( 2 ) using a galaxy model to derive the expected contamination rate of background stars with proper motions similar to gj  3629 .    the probability of an ultracool dwarf falling in the nirc2 field of view can be computed from the surface density of ultracool dwarfs ( @xmath17 ) and the solid angle subtended by the instrument ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the most complete census of ultracool dwarfs within 20 pc was compiled by @xcite .",
    "they identified 196 m7t2.5 systems covering @xmath1265% of the celestial sphere , which corresponds to a surface density @xmath17 of @xmath27.3@xmath910@xmath19 deg@xmath20 .",
    "our short exposure images of the gj  3629  a reach @xmath21@xmath22 @xmath2 7 , or @xmath22 @xmath2 16.4  mag .",
    "this is comparable to the limiting magnitude of the 2mass survey from which the reid et al .",
    "compilation is based , so no correction to the surface density is needed since the same depth is probed .",
    "the poisson distribution gives the probability of observing an event given an expectation value ( @xmath17@xmath9@xmath18 ) .",
    "since this value is small , the probability converges to the expectation value itself , which is @xmath26@xmath910@xmath23 for the 10@xmath02@xmath910@xmath02 nirc2 narrow camera .",
    "gj  3629 is part of our larger palms imaging survey , so the total sample size of the survey must be taken into account to determine if this rare event is consistent with the expected contamination rate for a given number of trials .",
    "when the multi - band observations of gj  3629  ab were made , which identified the candidate companion as a late - type object , we had imaged about 100 m dwarfs . assuming the contamination rate for the survey is comparable to that of gj 3629 , the probability of a field ultracool dwarf falling within our field of view by chance",
    "is roughly 6@xmath910@xmath24 .",
    "note that this only assumes contamination from a foreground ultracool dwarf without incorporating background late - type giants ( which will increase the probability of contamination ) ; the coincident proper motions of the components were also not taken into account ( which will decrease the probability of contamination ) .",
    "we also estimate the probability of contamination by a background star using the trilegal population synthesis code ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we use the default settings for the initial mass function , binary statistics , extinction values , and components of the galaxy .",
    "we queried a 10 deg@xmath25 region of the sky at the position of gj  3629 in the mko filter system down to a depth of 26  mag in @xmath26 band ( l. girardi , private communication ) . for the purposes of this",
    "_ a posteriori _ calculation , the magnitude cutoffs must reflect a range that would have been deemed `` interesting '' and worthy of follow - up observations .",
    "this corresponds to substellar objects down to the detection limits of our keck short exposure images .",
    "given the distance ( @xmath222  pc ) and age ( @xmath2100  myr ) of gj  3629 , the @xcite evolutionary models give a substellar brightness cutoff of @xmath22=11.4 .",
    "the surface density of stars with 11.4@xmath6@xmath22@xmath616.4 from the models is 62 deg@xmath20 , implying a probability of @xmath25@xmath910@xmath27 of a background star falling in the field of view .",
    "trilegal also includes a kinematic model that predicts stellar proper motions and has been shown to reproduce observed proper motion distributions ( @xcite ) .",
    "if in addition to our magnitude cutoff we impose a proper motion constraint of @xmath330  mas / yr in @xmath28cos@xmath29 and @xmath30 from gj  3629 , the implied surface density is 0.01  deg@xmath20 and the probability of contamination is @xmath28@xmath910@xmath23 .",
    "( this loose proper motion constraint allows for some orbital motion at smaller separations . ) note that we have not included a color cutoff ; this probability is for all background stars . even with the sample size of 100 targets , the probability that the candidate companion is a background object is negligibly small .",
    "gj  3629  b is therefore physically bound to the primary , and we can expect a third epoch of astrometry in a few years to show evidence of curvature in the orbital motion .      [ sec : age ]    x - ray and uv emission can be used to infer the ages of solar - type stars down to stars near the fully - convective boundary since high - energy emission traces magnetic field strengths , which decay over time as a result of slowing rotation rates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
