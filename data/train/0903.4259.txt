    "the intriguing possibility that our universe is only a part of a higher dimensional spacetime has raised a lot of interest in physics community recently . in string theory",
    "extra dimensions are necessary since superstring theory requires a ten - dimensional spacetime to be consistent from the quantum point of view .",
    "the effect of string theory on the left hand side of field equations of gravity is usually investigated by means of a low energy effective action which describes gravity at the classical level @xcite .",
    "this effective action consists of the einstein - hilbert action plus curvature - squared terms and higher powers as well , and in general give rise to fourth order field equations and bring in ghosts .",
    "however , if the effective action contains the higher powers of curvature in particular combinations , then only second order field equations are produced and consequently no ghosts arise @xcite .",
    "the effective action obtained by this argument is precisely of the form proposed by lovelock @xcite . on the other hand , the dynamics of d - branes and some soliton solutions of supergravity",
    "is governed by the born - infeld action @xcite , and therefore if one want to couple electromagnetic field with gravity it is more suitable to put the energy momentum of born - infeld electromagnetic field on the right hand side of the field equations .",
    "while the lovelock gravity was proposed to have field equations with at most second order derivatives of the metric @xcite , the nonlinear electrodynamics proposed , by born and infeld , with the aim of obtaining a finite value for the self - energy of a point - like charge @xcite .",
    "the lovelock gravity reduces to einstein gravity in four dimensions and also in the weak field limit , while the lagrangian of the born - infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics reduces to the maxwell lagrangian in the weak field limit .",
    "considering the analogy between the lovelock and the born - infeld terms , which are on similar footing with regard to string corrections on the gravity side and electrodynamic side , respectively , it is plausible to include both these corrections simultaneously .",
    "here we restrict ourself to the first three terms of lovelock gravity .",
    "the first two terms are the einstein - hilbert term with cosmological constant , while the third term is known as the gauss - bonnet term . in recent decades",
    ", the exact solutions of einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity and their properties were studied .",
    "for example , static spherically symmetric black hole solutions of the gauss - bonnet gravity were found in ref .",
    "black hole solutions with nontrivial topology in this theory were also studied in refs .",
    "nut charged black hole solutions of gauss - bonnet gravity and gauss - bonnet - maxwell gravity were obtained in @xcite . also rotating black hole solutions of gauss - bonnet - maxwell and born - infeld - gauss - bonnet gravity",
    "have been studied in @xcite .    currently , there exist some activities in the field of wormhole physics following , particularly , the seminal works of morris , thorne and yurtsever @xcite .",
    "morris and thorne assumed that their traversable wormholes were time independent , non - rotating , and spherically symmetric bridges between two universes .",
    "the manifold of interest is thus a static spherically symmetric spacetime possessing two asymptotically flat regions .",
    "these kinds of *  * wormholes could be threaded both by quantum and classical matter fields that violate certain energy conditions at least at the throat known as exotic matter .",
    "on general grounds , it has recently been shown that the amount of exotic matter needed at the wormhole throat can be made arbitrarily small thereby facilitating an easier construction of wormholes @xcite .",
    "lorentzian wormholes in spacetimes with more than four dimensions were analyzed by several authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , wormholes in gauss - bonnet gravity were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we are looking for the @xmath0-dimensional horizonless solutions in born - infeld - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the motivation for constructing these kinds of solutions is that they may be interpreted as wormhole . here",
    ", we will find these kinds of horizonless solutions in the born - infeld - gauss - bonnet gravity , and use the counterterm method to compute the conserved quantities of the system .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ long ] we give a brief review of the field equations of born - infeld - gauss - bonnet gravity , present a new class of static wormhole solutions which produces longitudinal magnetic field , and then we consider the properties of the solutions as well as the weak energy condition . in sec .",
