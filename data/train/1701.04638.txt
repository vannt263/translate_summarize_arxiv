    "accurate and reproducible measurement of material properties at the nanoscale is the main goal of dynamic atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "extraction of material properties from the measurable quantities in dynamic afm requires a deep understanding of both the tip - surface interaction and the dynamics of the afm cantilever when it is close to the sample surface .",
    "we propose a method that uses fourier analysis to measure and compensate for background forces , which are long range and not local to the afm tip .",
    "these interactions produce artifacts in the measurement of tip - surface force , leading to overestimation of its attractive and dissipative components .",
    "background forces are observed when measuring the quality factor of a cantilever resonance , which drops by as much as  @xmath0 when the tip - sample distance becomes comparable to the cantilever width ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qf0 ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been attributed to an additional squeeze - film damping force@xcite , arising when the fluid surrounding the cantilever is squeezed between the cantilever body and the sample surface .",
    "we also observe a slight decrease in the resonance frequency @xmath1 , due to increased hydrodynamic load .",
    "other long range forces appearing at tip - sample distances of a few micrometers have been attributed to electrostatic contributions@xcite .",
    "we have also observed in different commercial afm systems , a dependence of the cantilever s acoustic excitation on the extension of the scanning z - piezo , resulting in a change of the drive force which can be mistaken as a long range interaction .",
    "whatever their origin , be it hydrodynamic , electrostatic , or afm design , these background forces influence force reconstruction in dynamic afm . here",
    "we describe how to compensate for these background forces , assuming that they all share the following properties : they are linear as shown by a lack of intermodulation distortion@xcite ; they act over a long range , comparable to the cantilever width ; and they do not depend on the @xmath2 tip position over the sample surface , as they originate from the cantilever body rather than being local to the tip .",
    "we can easily compensate for any such background force to reveal the true tip - surface interaction , using linear response theory in the frequency domain .",
    "due to its generality and ease of implementation , we expect our method to be readily applied to a variety of force reconstruction methods essential for afm researchers .     and resonance frequency @xmath1 as a function of tip - sample distance over a homogeneous pdms surface .",
    "the values are obtained by fitting the thermal noise power spectral density , and plotted as the shift relative to a tip - sample distance of @xmath3 .",
    "the fitted @xmath4 drops by as much as @xmath0 , whereas the decrease in @xmath1 is three orders of magnitude smaller ( plotted values of @xmath1 are multiplied by  @xmath5 ) .",
    "the cantilever was a mikromasch hq : nsc15/albs . ]",
    "when an afm cantilever is far away from the sample surface , its fundamental flexural mode is well - modeled as a linear system .",
    "the frequency dependent linear response function @xmath6 relates the frequency components of any force @xmath7 to the resulting frequency components of the cantilever deflection @xmath8 : @xmath9 in our notation @xmath10 denotes a complex valued function of the real variable @xmath11 , the frequency . in particular",
    ", @xmath8 is the fourier transform of @xmath12 . in the following",
    ", we will drop the explicit @xmath11 dependence for the sake of compact notation .    when the driven and measured frequency components of @xmath13 are concentrated around the cantilever resonance frequency ,",
    "@xmath14 can be well - modeled as a dampened simple harmonic oscillator : @xmath15 the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath4 are the mode stiffness , resonance frequency and quality factor , respectively .",
    "these parameters , together with the optical lever responsivity , can be obtained by a non - invasive calibration procedure traceable to the measurement of the thermal fluctuations of the cantilever deflection when it is far from the surface@xcite .    the drive force with multiple frequency components @xmath18",
    "is applied to the cantilever by means of a shaker piezo in the case of acoustic actuation , or a pulsed laser beam in the case of photo - thermal excitation .",
    "regardless of the means of excitation , the drive force is determined by measuring the cantilever motion far away from the surface ( larger than @xmath19 ) at what we call the `` free '' position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](a ) ) . thus , we extract the driving force from a measurement of the cantilever free motion @xmath20 and the calibrated linear response function @xmath14 @xmath21    as the afm probe approaches the sample surface , background forces begin to affect the cantilever body when its separation from the surface becomes comparable to its width , as shown in fig .

    "fig : qf0 ] .",
    "background forces change the cantilever motion ( compare insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](b ) ) , but they are clearly linear , as seen from the lack of intermodulation@xcite in the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](b ) .    when the afm tip starts interacting with the surface at what we call the `` engaged '' position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](c ) ) , the measured motion is affected by all the forces at play @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the nonlinear tip - surface force , carrying all the information about the material properties , and @xmath24 are the background forces",
    ". we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_drive ] ) to account for the drive force , but in oder to solve for the tip - surface force we must eliminate the background forces .",
    "note that , while the components of the drive force @xmath18 can be treated as constant , the components of the background forces @xmath24 depend on the motion @xmath13 which changes from pixel to pixel .",
    "for example , a squeeze - film damping force will depend on the velocity of the cantilever .    motivated by experimental observation ( lack of intermodulation distortion )",
    ", we treat the problem of a general linear background force without regard to its particular origin , by expressing it in terms of a linear response function @xmath25 @xmath26 equation  ( [ eq : def_chi_bg ] ) allows for the calculation of @xmath24 for any motion @xmath13 .",
    "our treatment assumes that there exists a linear differential equation of the cantilever deflection which describes the background forces .",
    "this equation can in principle be very complicated , _ e.g. _ involve fractional derivatives and have many parameters , but we assume that it does not change as the probe scans over the sample , consistent with the idea that the background forces act on the body of the cantilever .    lifting the probe slightly away from the surface , we find that the short ranged @xmath23 goes to zero with an abrupt drop in intermodulation , while the long ranged @xmath24 is barely affected .",
    "we define the `` lift '' position as the closest distance for which the forces acting on the cantilever are linear ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : algorithm ] ) .    at the lift position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](b ) ) , the total force is given by the drive force @xmath18 and the linear background forces @xmath24 only .",

    "( [ eq : chi_bg ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain the tip - surface force : @xmath31 equation  ( [ eq : correction ] ) allows for the compensation of the background forces , and thus the calculation of the tip - surface force at every pixel of an afm image , provided the knowledge of @xmath18 and of @xmath25 , both being constant during the afm scan .",
    ") for different number of drive tones @xmath32 is measured as function of the afm feedback amplitude set - point .",
    "as the afm probe moves away from the surface ( increasing set - point ) , @xmath33 gradually decreases until the probe suddenly breaks free from the tip - surface interaction @xmath34 and a sharp drop in @xmath33 is observed .",
    "the lift motion is measured at this drop . ]    to accurately determine the linear response function of the background forces @xmath25 , we need to measure the cantilever motion @xmath29 as close to the surface as possible without tip - surface interaction .",
    "we use the notion that the tip - surface force is strongly nonlinear , while the background forces are linear , as evidenced by the measurements of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : imd ] .",
    "we apply a multifrequency drive with a number of discrete components @xmath32 at the set of frequencies @xmath35 with @xmath36 , _ i.e. _ @xmath37 is non - zero for @xmath38 . when the linear forces @xmath18 and @xmath24 act on the cantilever , the response @xmath8 will be non - zero only at @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](a , b ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the cantilever is experiencing the nonlinear @xmath23 , response will arise at intermodulation product frequencies @xmath39 given by integer linear combinations of the drive frequencies :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is an integer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra](c ) ) .",
    "we introduce the intermodulation distortion @xmath33 , as the ratio of the power at undriven frequencies to the power at driven frequencies :    @xmath42    in principle , we want to measure @xmath29 at the minimum distance from the surface such that @xmath43 . in practice , however , we will always measure some non - zero noise power .",
    "we therefore choose a threshold ( typically @xmath44 ) and measure @xmath29 at the minimum distance from the surface such that @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig : imd ] shows the intermodulation distortion as a function of amplitude set - point measured for drive schemes with different number of drive tones @xmath32 . as the afm feedback set - point increases , a characteristic behavior is visible showing a gradual decrease of @xmath33 with increasing set - point , due to the decrease of the non - linear tip - surface interaction @xmath23 .",
    "when the set - point reaches a value of about @xmath46 , a sharp drop in @xmath33 is observed , indicating a transition from an overall nonlinear force to an overall linear force .",
    "this sharp transition allows for unambiguous measurement of @xmath29 , from which we calculate the linear response function of the background forces @xmath25 .",

    "( [ eq : chi_bg ] ) will therefore yield @xmath47 only at the drive frequencies @xmath38 . on the other hand , to apply the compensation to the measured data with eq .",
    "( [ eq : correction ] ) we require the knowledge of @xmath47 at all the frequencies in the spectrum of engaged motion @xmath48 .    to overcome this issue",
    "we use the notion of narrow band measurement on a resonant system . due to the high q resonance in the cantilever linear response function",
    ", the motion will be concentrated at frequencies close to the resonance frequency @xmath17 , within a narrow band  @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of measured frequencies ( typically 32 ) and @xmath52 is typically chosen as the measurement bandwidth .",
    "we perform a polynomial expansion of the complex function @xmath47 in this narrow band : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the imaginary constant and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are sets of real coefficients to be determined .",
    "a drive force with @xmath32 frequency components allows for the determination of up to @xmath57 coefficients , corresponding to two polynomial fits of degree @xmath58 of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath25 .",
    "it is possible to perform a low degree fit with a high number of drives , @xmath59 , in which case the coefficients are obtained with a least square optimization method .",
    "while a higher order fit could in principle describe a more complex @xmath25 , we find that a linear approximation of each of the two quadratures ( 4 coefficients , requiring 2 or more drive frequencies ) is sufficient to describe the background forces .",
    "a higher order fit is not always numerically stable , and it can introduce artifacts in the compensated data .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : polyfit ] ) is quite general , allowing for a good approximation to any type of linear background force .",
    "a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : polyfit ] ) is a polynomial with only two coefficients of the form @xmath60 where @xmath16 is the mode stiffness and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are fit parameters . in this case",
    "it can be shown that the background forces result in an effective cantilever with a renormalized linear response function @xmath63 of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_cant ] ) , where the resonance frequency and quality factor are given by    @xmath64    this special case is often assumed when analyzing forces in dynamic afm@xcite .",
    "we have shown how to mathematically treat the problem of compensating for arbitrary linear background forces , and we proposed a simple method to obtain their response function .",
    "we now show an application of this method on soft material surfaces where background forces are typically rather large .",

    "@xmath65 is the force in phase with the cantilever motion integrated over one oscillation cycle , representing the conservative forces experienced by the cantilever at different oscillation amplitudes .",
    "@xmath66 is the force quadrature to the cantilever motion integrated over one oscillation cycle , showing the dissipative interaction of the cantilever with its environment and with the surface .",
    "the force quadratures represent a direct transformation of the measured data without any model assumptions , providing a physically intuitive way of analyzing the measured cantilever dynamics in terms of conservative and dissipative interactions .    at low amplitudes the uncompensated force quadratures ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_ldpe](b , c ) ) show a positive slope in @xmath65 at low amplitude , the signature of a long range attractive force .",
    "the negative slope in @xmath66 is a signature of a linear damping , in addition to the damping contained in @xmath14 which is calibrated far away from the surface .",
    "some hysteresis is also present in both sets of curves , indicating that the background forces are not purely of the type described by the special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : polyfit_ho ] ) .",
    "notably , the low amplitude background forces are the same for the two sets of curves , despite being measured over different areas of the sample with very different material properties , confirming that the background forces are not local to the afm tip .",
    "we used a drive scheme with @xmath67 , measured @xmath29 over a polystyrene area of the sample ( black circle in fig .",

    "the slope at low amplitudes is now missing , as well as most of the hysteretic effects ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : ps_ldpe](b ) ) .",
    "we note that the compensation calculated over a polystyrene area of the sample has this effect not only for the force quadratures on the polystyrene , but also for those on polyethylene .",
    "taken together , these observations confirm the validity of the assumption that while the background forces change for every pixel of the image , their linear response function does not change during the whole scan .",
    "figure  [ fig : hydrogel ] shows the same measurement and compensation procedure on a silicone hydrogel sample in a high humidity environment .",

    "[ fig : hydrogel](a ) ) with very different mechanical response as shown by the peculiar shapes of the force quadratures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hydrogel](b , c ) ) .",
    "also in this sample it is clear how the background force compensation corrects for the long - range attractive forces and increased dissipation , while at the same time preserving the interesting features of the tip - surface force and the peculiar hysteresis .",
    "this will be discussed further in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we have shown the effect of applying the background force compensation on the dynamic force quadratures @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the compensation procedure is however general and can be applied to any force reconstruction method .",
    "once the frequency components of the compensated tip - surface force @xmath23 are obtained from eq .",

    "fig : adfs ] we calculate the tip - surface force on the polystyrene and on the solid domain of the hydrogel sample with amplitude - dependent force spectroscopy@xcite ( adfs ) , with and without compensation for the background forces .",
    "not compensating for background forces would lead to overestimating the adhesion force by @xmath69 for polystyrene , and by @xmath70 for the solid domain of the hydrogel .",
    "the observed peak - force would be instead underestimated by about @xmath71 in both cases ( not shown in fig .",
