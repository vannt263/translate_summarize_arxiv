    "let @xmath3 and let @xmath0 denote the moduli space of riemann spheres with @xmath2 ordered marked points .",
    "the main examples of periods of @xmath4 consist of integrals @xcite @xmath5 for suitable choices of integers @xmath6 such that the integral converges .",
    "these integrals have a variety of applications ranging from superstring theory @xcite to irrationality proofs @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that such integrals are linear combinations of multiple zeta values @xmath7 with rational coefficients .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to provide effective algorithms , based on @xcite , for computing such integrals @xmath8 symbolically .",
    "the idea is to integrate out one variable at a time by working in a suitable algebra of iterated integrals ( or rather , their symbols ) which is closed under the two operations of taking primitives and taking limits along boundary divisors .",
    "the second main application is for the calculation of a large class of feynman amplitudes , based on the universal property of the spaces @xmath0 .",
    "the general idea goes as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 is a stable curve of genus zero .",
    "then the universal property of moduli spaces yields an @xmath10 and a commutative diagram : @xmath11 the idea is that , for a specific class of ( multi - valued ) forms on @xmath12 , we can integrate in the fibers of @xmath12 over @xmath13 by passing to the right - hand side of the diagram and computing the integral on the moduli space @xmath14 . in this way",
    ", it only suffices to describe algorithms to integrate on the universal curve @xmath14 over @xmath0 . in practice , this involves computing a change of variables to pass from @xmath12 to a set of convenient coordinates on the moduli space @xmath14 , applying the algorithm of @xcite to integrate out one of these coordinates , and finally changing variables back to @xmath13 .",
    "this process can be repeated for certain varieties which can be fibered in curves of genus @xmath1 and yields an effective algorithm for computing a large class of integrals .",
    "necessary conditions for such fibrations to exist ( ` linear reducibility ' ) were described in @xcite and apply to many families of feynman integrals , as we discuss in more detail presently .",
    "any feynman integral in even - dimensional space - time can always be expressed as an integral in schwinger parameters @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are polynomials with ( typically ) rational coefficients and which perhaps depend on other parameters such as masses or momenta .",
    "cohomologial considerations tell us that the types of numbers occurring as such integrals only depend on the denominator @xmath18 , and not on the numerator @xmath17 . a basic idea of @xcite",
    "is to compute the integral @xmath19 by integrating out the schwinger parameters @xmath20 one at a time in some well - chosen order .",
    "after @xmath21 integrations , we require that the partial integral @xmath22 be expressed as a certain kind of generalised polylogarithm function , or iterated integral . under certain conditions on the singularities of the integrand , the next variable can be integrated out .",
    "a ` linear reduction ' algorithm @xcite yields an upper bound for the set of singularities of @xmath23 and can tell us in advance whether @xmath19 can be computed by this method .",
    "it takes the form of a sequence of sets of polynomials ( or rather , their associated hypersurfaces ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is derived from @xmath27 by taking certain resultants of polynomials in @xmath28 with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath18 is linearly reducible , we obtain a sequence of spaces for @xmath30 : @xmath31 and maps @xmath32 which correspond to projecting out the variable @xmath29 .",
    "the linear reducibility assumption guarantees that @xmath33 fibers over @xmath34 in curves of genus @xmath1 . thus setting @xmath35 in the discussion above",
    ", we can explicitly find changes of variables in the @xmath20 to write @xmath23 as an iterated integral on a moduli space @xmath0 and do the next integration .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that such a method should ever work for any non - trivial feynman integrals .",
    "the fundamental reason it does , however , is that the polynomial @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of determinants of matrices whose entries are linear in the @xmath20 parameters . in the case",
    "when @xmath18 is the first symanzik polynomial , and to a lesser extent when @xmath18 also depends on masses and external momenta , it satisfies many ` resultant identities ' , which only break down at a certain loop order .",
    "there are two possible approaches to implementing the above algorithm : one which is now referred to as the ` method of hyperlogarithms ' @xcite , which stays firmly on the left - hand side of the diagram @xmath36 ; the other , which is the algorithm described here @xcite , which makes more systematic use of the geometry of the moduli spaces @xmath0 and works on the right - hand side of the diagram @xmath36 .    the first involves working directly in schwinger parameters , and expressing all partial integrals as hyperlogarithms ( iterated integrals of one variable ) whose arguments are certain rational functions in schwinger parameters .",
    "it has been fully implemented by panzer @xcite and various parts of the algorithm have found applications in different contexts , as described below .",
    "a conceptual disadvantage of this method is that the underlying geometry of every feynman diagram is different .",
    "the second method , espoused here , is to compute all integrals on the moduli spaces @xmath0 ( which , by no accident , are the universal domain of definition for hyperlogarithms ) .",
    "thus the underlying geometry is always the same and is well - understood ; all the information about the particular integral @xmath19 is contained in the changes of variables @xmath36 .",
    "another key difference is the systematic use of generalised symbols of functions in several complex variables , as opposed to functions of a single variable ( hyperlogarithms ) .    that these two points of view are equivalent is theorem [ thmvdecomp ] below , but leads , in practice , to a rather different algorithmic approach .",
    "we nonetheless provide algorithms ( the symbol and unshuffle maps ) to pass between both points of view .",
    "the above method can be applied to a range of feynman integrals provided that the initial integral @xmath19 is convergent .",
    "the case of massless , single - scale , primitively overall - divergent feynman diagrams in a scalar field theory was detailed in @xcite . since then",
    ", the method was applied to the computation of integrals of hexagonal feynman graphs , arising in @xmath37 supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite , integrals with operator insertions contributing to massive matrix elements of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , one- and two - loop triangular feynman graphs with off - shell legs @xcite , phase - space contributions @xcite to the cross - section for threshold production of the higgs boson from gluon - fusion at n3lo qcd @xcite , coefficients in the expansion of certain hypergeometric functions , contributing to superstring amplitudes @xcite , massless multi - loop propagator - type integrals @xcite , and a variety of three- and four - point feynman integrals depending on several kinematical scales @xcite .",
    "these applications arise from very different contexts and the method is combined with various other computational techniques .",
    "focussing on feynman integrals , we can summarize by stating that the method can be extended to the following situations :    * to feynman graphs with several masses or kinematic scales . * to gauge theories , or more generally , integrals with arbitrary numerator structures . * to graphs with ultra - violet subdivergences .",
    "in particular , it is compatible with the renormalisation procedure due to bogoliubov , parasiuk , hepp and zimmermann ( bphz ) in a momentum scheme @xcite .",
    "* finally , it can also be combined with dimensional regularisation to treat uv and ir divergences by the method of @xcite .",
    "the method is suited for automatization on a computer .",
    "for the special case of harmonic polylogarithms , the programs @xcite support direct integration using these functions .",
    "for the general approach , using hyperlogarithms , a first implementation of the method was presented in ref .",
    "a program for the numerical evaluation of these functions is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there appear to be other classes of integrals which are not strictly feynman diagrams , but for which the method of iterated fibration in curves of genus zero @xmath36 still applies .",
    "a basic example are periods of arbitrary hyperplane complements @xcite , and as a consequence , various families of integrals occurring in deformation quantization , for example .      in section @xmath38 we review some of the mathematics of iterated integrals on moduli spaces @xmath0 , based on @xcite .",
    "the geometric ideas behind the main algorithms are outlined here . in  [ sec : computing - on - the ] , these algorithms are spelled out in complete detail together with some illustrative examples . in  [ sec : feynman - type - integrals ] , it is explained how to pass between feynman integral representations and moduli space representations . in  [ sec : applications ] we discuss some applications , before presenting the conclusions . some introductory background can be found in the survey papers @xcite . + the methods of @xmath39 should in principle generalise to genus @xmath40 , using multiple elliptic polylogarithms defined in @xcite , but there remains a considerable amount of theoretical groundwork to be done .",
    "a different direction for generalisation is to introduce roots of unity , by replacing @xmath41 with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the group of @xmath44 roots of unity",
    ". this should be rather similar to the framework discussed here .",

    "the main advantage of cubical coordinates is that the divisors corresponding to @xmath58 are strict normal crossing in a neighbourhood of the origin @xmath59 .",

    "iterated integrals along this path give rise to coefficients of the drinfeld associator , which are multiple zeta values . iterated integrals along @xmath154",
    "can be identified with our class of multivalued functions on the boundary divisor @xmath121 of @xmath125 defined by @xmath139 , which is canonically isomorphic to @xmath164 .",
    "one can check that the above argument makes sense for regularised ( divergent ) iterated integrals , and putting the pieces together yields the regularisation algorithm which is described below .",
    "for the computation of period integrals , one needs slightly more .",
    "we actually require an expansion of the function @xmath165 as a polynomial in @xmath166 and a taylor expansion of @xmath144 up to some order @xmath167 in @xmath168 .",
    "this is because @xmath140 can occur with a rational prefactor which may have poles in @xmath168 of order @xmath167 .",
    "this taylor expansion is straightforward to compute recursively by expanding @xmath169 and integrating ( we know the constant terms by the previous discussion ) .",
    "the partial derivative @xmath169 is simply a component of the total differential @xmath116 defined in @xmath106 , which decreases the length and hence this gives an algorithm which terminates after finitely many steps , also described below .",
    "note that in order to compute period integrals @xmath8 , one only requires taking limits with respect to the final cubical variable @xmath110 for @xmath170 .",
    "it can happen , for example when computing feynman integrals , that one wants to take limits at more general divisors on @xmath125 .",

    "this order can be determined from the combinatorics of the dihedral coordinates , and gives an algorithm to compute limits in this more general sense .",
    "for example , in the figure , the point @xmath182 is reached by taking the limit first as @xmath187 goes to @xmath40 and then @xmath188 goes to @xmath40 ; the point @xmath183 corresponds to the opposite order .",
