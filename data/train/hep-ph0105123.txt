    "0.25 in    one of the fundamental calculation in particle theory is the @xmath2 decay rate @xcite .",
    "it is a combination of partial conserved axial current ( pcac ) and the short distance behavior of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) : @xmath3 with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electric charge , @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 is the number of color in qcd .",
    "this calculation is valid in a world where the @xmath8 is massless .",
    "some corrections have to be made in order to take into account of the finite value of the pion mass .",
    "it turns out that the massless pion anomaly formula is in a very good agreement with the pion life time data @xcite , implying that the correction due to the physical pion mass in eq .",
    "( [ eq : npgg ] ) is very small .",
    "another axial anomaly result is the process @xmath9 or its analytical continuation @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this last process requires more corrections because , for practical consideration , measurements are done at an energy far from the chiral limit where the anomaly formula is applicable .",
    "furthermore the analytical continuation from one process to the other is a delicate procedure due to the presence of the complex singularity which is absent in the former reaction .",
    "the calculation of the process @xmath9 is in itself interesting because of future experiments being proposed at various accelerator facilities and also of its important role in the calculation of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 amplitude is given as : @xmath12 where s , t , u are the kinematical variables for this process and will be defined below .    in the chiral limit ( the zero limit of the pion 4-momenta ) , the matrix element is given by the anomaly equation : @xmath13 where the zero in the argument of @xmath14 refers to the chiral limit of the massless pions ; the number of colors @xmath15 is equal to 3 .",
    "experimentally , @xmath16 is measured at an average photon pion energy of 0.4 gev and assuming that there is no momentum dependence in g(s , t , u ) , it is equal to @xcite : @xmath17    the agreement between experiment and theory is not good but certainly corrections will have to be made because measurements made in this experiment are far from the chiral symmetry limit .",
    "the calculations of this process are usually done within the vector meson dominance models ( vmd ) @xcite.recently this process is discussed within the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) to one loop @xcite and also a combination of chpt and vmd @xcite and the unitarization of the chpt two loop amplitude @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate the scattering of @xmath18 using dispersion relation , elastic unitarity and the knowledge of the p - wave pion pion phase shits .",
    "an integral equation is obtained and is similar to the muskelishvilli - omnes ( m - o ) integral equation used in the pion form factor calculation @xcite .",
    "the integral equation obtained here is , however , much more complicated due to the symmetry of the problem .",
    "its solution can only be obtained by a numerical method .",
    "the pion form factor calculation , using the m - o integral equation approach , yields a pion radius too low by 10% and a modulus of the pion form factor at the @xmath19 resonance also too low by 15% .",
    "this is due to the assumption of the elastic unitarity relation which is only valid in the low energy region below 1.2 gev but can not be true at and above the @xmath20 ( 1.5 gev ) region . in order to remove this discrepancy",
    "one has to use also , as input , the pion r.m.s radius and hence , one has either to make an extra subtraction in the dispersion relation or to make use of the polynomial ambiguity of the solution of the m - o equation .",
    "one would then get not only the correct value of the absolute value of the pion form factor at the @xmath19 mass ( i.e. the @xmath19 leptonic width ) , but also a complete agreement with the pion form factor below 1 gev @xcite .",
    "the phases of the form factor are of course the experimental p - wave @xmath21 phase shifts due to the solution of the m - o equation .",
    "we also face the same problem in the calculation of the scattering @xmath18 .",
    "the problem could , however , be more serious here than in the pion form factor calculation due to the existence of the t and u channels . not only the first derivative of the dominant p - wave amplitude vanishes at the energy squared @xmath1 , but its second derivative at this energy is not accessible to experiments because of the lack of experimental precision .",
    "a further complication is due to the ambiguity of the solution of the integral equation obtained here due to the symmetry of the problem .",
    "it is related to but is not purely the polynomial type .",
    "for this reason we can not make a comparable prediction of the @xmath18 cross section at the @xmath19 mass or @xmath22 width .",
    "the measurement of this width could then be used to make a prediction of the energy dependence of the @xmath18 away from the @xmath19 mass and in particular in the low energy region where the the first measurement of @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : anomaly4 ] ) , was made .",
    "the kinematics of this process are defined as : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . because all particles involved are on shell , one has @xmath26 . in the center of mass system , in terms of the scattering angle @xmath27",
    ", we have : @xmath28 the partial wave expansion for @xmath29 is given as follows @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath27 is the scattering angle and @xmath31 is the first derivative of the legendre polynomial .",
    "hence the lowest partial wave is : @xmath32 in terms of the function @xmath33 the differential cross section for the process @xmath34 is @xmath35",
    "because our integral equation solution is a more sophisticated and precised approach to the vector meson dominance model ( vmd ) @xcite , where unitarity and dispersion relation are extensively used , it can not avoid the same problems which are presented in these models .",
    "namely the solution can only uniquely obtained when the asymptotic behavior of the solution is specified .",
    "it is then useful to review briefly the vmd models and calculations of the pion form factor with and without introducing the contact term .",
    "let us consider the vmd models without and with the contact terms for the @xmath36 process as previouly discussed in the litterature @xcite . without the contact term , the vmd model for @xmath37 amplitude is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the invariant kinematics and @xmath16 is defined by eq .",

    "( [ eq:3p2 ] , [ eq:3p3 ] ) do not vanish due to the presence of the contact term .",
    "we have introduced phenomenologically the contact term c in the scattering @xmath43 without worrying how it influences the vmd for the corresponding process @xmath45 . assuming a complete vmd for @xmath46",
    ", one has c=1 in order that the ksrf relation @xcite remains valid @xcite .",
    "the strength of the contact term also influences the value of the second derivative of the p - wave amplitude at @xmath1 .",

    "one has finally : @xmath49    instead of characterizing the contact term by the infinite energy behavior of the matrix element , we can specify its presence by evaluating its second derivative for the p - wave at @xmath1 . for the pure vmd , @xmath50 ,",
    "it is equal to @xmath51 and for the hidden symmetry model @xcite , @xmath52 , it is @xmath53 .",
    "( [ eq:3p1 ] ) yields a decay width @xmath54 which is too small compared with the experimental value .",
    "( [ eq:3p2 ] ) for @xmath52 yields a decay width @xmath55 in much better agreement with the data ( see below ) .",
    "the experimental value of the @xmath56 coupling or the ksrf relation @xcite for the @xmath57 coupling are used to calculate these widths .",
    "one can improve these equations by making the vector meson @xmath19 unstable using the self - energy correction for the @xmath19 propagator @xcite and using the ksrf relation @xcite .",
    "this same result can also be obtained using the inverse amplitude for the vector form factor _ without _ assuming the ksrf relation .",
    "the @xmath19 width obeys the ksrf relation as a consequence of the implementation of the unitarity relation @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath58 is then replaced by a function @xmath59 which is normalized to unity at s=0 and is defined as follows :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is related to the @xmath19 mass squared @xmath63 by requiring that the real part of the denominator of eq .",

    "1 . alternatively one can use the experimental phase shift to calculate the function @xmath59 but the expression given above is most convenient .",

    "the chiral symmetry limit should be defined as the limit of s , t , u tend to zero first and then @xmath71 .",
    "this order should be respected because the branch point at @xmath72 also goes to zero in the chiral limit . using this definition",
    "we could have calculated @xmath73 in terms of @xmath16 without using the large @xmath74 limit , but the difference is negligible as discussed previously .    replacing @xmath58 by @xmath59 in eq .",

    "( [ eq:3p2 ] ) gives @xmath77 .",
    "the difference between these values and those obtained previouly are just due to the @xmath19 finite width correction .",
    "these results show the importance of the presence of the contact term . while the present experimental data on the @xmath22 are not settled , it is likeky that the result for the hidden symmetry model is favored ( see below ) .    with chiral symmetry broken ,",

    "this result is not surprising because the multiple @xmath21 scattering correction , which should be relevant for this problem , is not taken into account in these equations . the contact term model with c=1 satisfies the phase theorem better than the pure vmd model due to the presence of the contact term which increases significantly the magnitude the resonance term compared with the background terms from the t and u channels",

    "one exception is the problem involving three hadrons with two light particles having no interactions between them but they interact with an infinitely heavy target .",
    "holstein s solution yields a comparable value for @xmath205 as our solution with @xmath169 .",
    "this result is not surprising because the value of the second derivative of his solution at @xmath1 is also comparable with ours",
    ". his solution can be fixed by projecting out the p - wave imaginary part and put it in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fstu ] ) to provide the necessary corrections .",
    "it should be reemphasized that our result is not in the product form as in eq.([eq : holstein ] ) but as a sum of the three identical functions with the interchange of s , t , u variables eq.([eq : fstu ] ) and eq.([eq : final ] ) .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the fixed t dispersion relation , using crossing symmetry and neglecting the contribution form the higher partial waves at low energy in the absorptive parts .",
    "our formulation of the problem @xmath9 is quite useful in understanding the importance of the multiple scattering effect as a function of the @xmath19 width .",
    "we have previouly stated that in the large n@xmath206 limit the multiple scattering effect should vanish and we should recover the vmd models as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3p1],[eq:3p2],[eq:3p3 ] ) . in order to see that this statement is correct",
    ", it is sufficient to study the correction factor j(s ) defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff2 ] ) as a function of the @xmath19 width .",
    "it is sufficient to study this question for the case when @xmath161 . in fig .",
    "10 , the modulus of the function j(s ) is plotted against the energy squared when the @xmath19 widths are increased or decreased by a factor of 4 when @xmath207 is changed by a factor of 2 .",
    "this can be seen from examining the definition of the function of @xmath59 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vu1 ] ) .",
    "the result is the multiple scattering effect increases as the @xmath19 width increases , and decreases as the the @xmath19 width decreases .",
    "it is easy to see that for a zero width resonance , the correction factor j(s ) is unity .",
    "the result of this section provides also some arguments for the neglect of the multiple scattering effect in the study of @xmath208 and @xmath209 with the 3@xmath210 resonating as the @xmath211 state because of the extreme small width of this resonance @xcite .",
    "we have studied in this article the scattering of @xmath212 using the integral equation approach . because the second derivative of the p - wave amplitude at @xmath1 is not known , the maximum cross section for this process can not be predicted with reliability .",
    "the solution of the integral equation is ambiguous and depends on the second derivative of the p - wave amplitude at @xmath1 .",
    "this problem is similar to problem of the contact term in the usual vmd model .",
    "if the ambiguity of the solution of the integral equation could be interpreted as the imperfectness of the elastic unitarity relation in describing the low energy phenomena , then one would have to be satisfied with a precision of the order of 15% in amplitude for the pion form factor calculation @xcite .",
    "this inadequacy could then be removed using the knowledge of the pion r.m.s .",
    "radius @xcite .    for the @xmath212 calculation , this inadequacy could become more serious due to the existence of singularities associated with the t and u channels .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding first derivative of the p - wave amplitude vanishes due to the symmetry of the problem , and hence we could only use the knowledge of the second derivative at @xmath1 to fix up the inadequacy of the elastic unitarity relation .",
    "this last parameter could not be precisely measured and hence we could not predict with certainty @xmath213 .    we show in this article that there is a one to one correspondance between the contact term in the vmd model and the ambiguity associated with the parameter @xmath129 in our integral equation approach .",
