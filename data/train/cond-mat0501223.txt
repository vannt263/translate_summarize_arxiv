    "thus the asymptotic behavior is proportional to @xmath2 , in excellent qualitative _ and _ quantitative agreement with the prediction of model e.",
    "provided the system is sufficiently close to steady state , we can linearize the set of eqs .  ( [ eq : einfachedgls ] ) around @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "this is particularly simple for models a , b , and d , where the coefficients in the differential equation do not depend on @xmath120 and hence can be solved analytically for the stationary state .",
    "we set @xmath243 and @xmath244 and obtain the linearized dynamic equations @xmath245 this set of linear equations is easily solved to yield two relaxation rates @xmath246 and @xmath247 . in a stable stationary state they must be positive and they are .",
    "we present here only results for the simplest model ( a ) and postpone the general discussion to the next paragraph , where the full dynamic evolution towards steady state will be examined .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_12 ] , we plot the two relaxation rates as a function of @xmath13 for a fixed value of @xmath221 . in the limit of smooth spheres",
    "one of the rates vanishes because the rotational energy is conserved in that limit . for @xmath248",
    "the two rates are equal and for increasing @xmath13 the difference between the two rates increases monotonically with @xmath13 , such that for perfectly rough spheres the larger rate is about fourteen times the smaller one .",
    "such a pronounced separation of time scales is familiar from the cooling dynamics of the same model , see @xcite . there it was shown that the ratio of translational to rotational energy , @xmath120 , relaxes fast to its stationary value , whereas both the translational as well as the rotational energy decay on the same , much longer time scale .",
    "this point will be discussed in a more general setting ( model e and relaxation from an arbitrary initial condition ) in the subsequent paragraph .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_time ] , the full dynamic evolution of the translational and rotational temperatures with time is shown for two simulations with @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath221 , @xmath228 , and different values for the coefficient of friction .",
    "in both situations , the agreement between simulations and the numerical solution for the full mf theory , model e , is good  not only concerning the limiting values and the asymptotes , but also the time dependence during the two regimes ( i ) equilibration between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and ( ii ) approach to final steady state .",
    "in summary , a dynamic mf theory for the full time evolution of the translational and rotational temperatures of a homogeneously driven two - dimensional granular gas has been presented .",
    "particle collisions were modeled using the walton model @xcite , i.e.  with normal dissipation , tangential restitution ( sticking ) and coulomb friction ( sliding ) .",
    "the walton model can be formulated in terms of a coefficient of tangential restitution , which _ depends _ on the impact angle @xmath4 . using a pseudo - liouville operator we have computed the distribution of impact angles as well as the mean field dynamics and steady state values of the translational and rotational temperatures .",
    "in addition to the complete mean field theory of the walton model ( `` model e '' ) , we discussed three levels of approximation in order to simplify the differential equations of the time evolution .",
    "the crudest approximations including coulomb friction ( `` model b '' and `` model c '' ) assume that an effective constant tangential restitution exists and can be computed by averaging over the angular distribution of impact angles . for model c",
    "this averaged coefficient depends on the current values of the translational and rotational temperatures and thus on time .",
    "even simpler is model b where the rotational contribution to the impact angle is neglected , leading to a coefficient of tangential restitution that only depends on global system parameters .",
    "the closest approximation ( `` model d '' ) to the full mean field theory ( `` model e '' ) keeps the dependence of @xmath3 on the impact angle @xmath4 but , like for model b , the contribution of the rotation of the particles to the impact angle is neglected .",
    "the predictions of the increasingly refined models of frictional dissipation as well as the full mf theory have been compared to simulations of a randomly driven mono - layer of spheres using an event driven algorithm .",
    "emphasis has been put on the stationary state which is characterized by two temperatures , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , one for the translational and one for the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "guided by the mf approach we discovered a rich phenomenology like a non - trivial dependence of the stationary state temperatures on the model parameters .",
    "for example , the translational temperature is non - monotonic as a function of maximal tangential restitution @xmath13 and also non - monotonic as a function of coulomb friction @xmath2 , provided @xmath13 is sufficiently large .",
    "all models predict steady state values of the translational and rotational temperatures , which are considerably improved as compared to the model without friction ( `` model a '' ) , which assumes constant tangential restitution ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : tmu ] and [ fig : rmu ] ) .",
    "all approximations a - e agree in the limit of large friction , where the tangential restitution becomes independent of the impact angle ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : r_t ] ) .",
    "qualitative agreement between models b - d and simulations is achieved also for intermediate values of @xmath2 .",
    "however in the limit @xmath147 all approximations break down and only the complete mean field solution ( `` model e '' ) is in agreement with the simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rmus ] ) .",
    "in particular model e predicts the linear dependence of the ratio of temperatures , @xmath251 , on the friction coefficient @xmath2 that is observed in the simulations and was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to derive an approximate kinetic theory of frictional particles .",
    "sticking contacts become more important relative to sliding contacts for fixed @xmath2 and decreasing @xmath13 . in this",
    "regime models b and d seem reasonable , but lead to poor quantitative agreement as @xmath13 approaches @xmath252 . the full mean field theory ( `` model e '' ) leads to reasonable agreement for all values of @xmath13 .",
    "for weak dissipation , @xmath233 , the agreement is very good  for stronger dissipation , we relate the deviations to the failure of both the homogeneity assumption and the molecular chaos assumption made",
    ".    linearizing the dynamic mf equations around the steady state leads to an eigenvalue problem with two relaxation rates , one of them being related to the equilibration between the translational and the rotational degrees of freedom , while the other one controls the approach of the system to its steady state . for strong coupling ,",
    "the former process is much faster , so that there is a clear separation of time scales , which has been discussed already for a freely cooling system in the absence of driving .    in conclusion ,",
    "realistic coulomb friction turned out to be a subtle problem as only the full mean field theory of the walton model predicts the effects of friction for all values of @xmath2 and @xmath13 .",
    "all simplifications are both qualitatively and quantitatively wrong in some parameter range . our studies",
    "can easily be extended to three dimensional systems or more complex ones , like e.g. a polydisperse mixture of frictional particles with different material properties .",
    "other driving mechanisms could be employed as well .",
