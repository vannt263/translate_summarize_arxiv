    "inertial sensors for particle beams based on material transmission gratings exist and have been studied extensively ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "commonly , these devices are moir deflectometers @xcite : two - grating setups operating in the classical regime , with the particles following ballistic trajectories and producing geometrical shadow fringe patterns .",
    "the presence of a constant and uniform force in the transverse direction ( corresponding to an acceleration @xmath0 ) induces a displacement @xmath1 in the fringe pattern , where @xmath2 is the time of flight between the two gratings .",
    "it is known that the talbot - lau matter - wave interferometer @xcite also possesses the same inertial sensitivity @xcite . unlike the moir deflectometer ,",
    "this device operates in the quantum diffraction regime ; therefore the properties of the interference pattern depend on the de broglie wavelength of the interfering particles @xcite .",
    "in this paper we aim to investigate the precise behaviour of the displacement @xmath3 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , in both the classical and quantum regime .",
    "more in details , we use the wigner function formalism @xcite to study the statistical interference pattern produced by a general talbot - lau interferometer in the presence of an external force .",
    "first we recover the result that period - magnifying interferometers can be realised under the appropriate resonance conditions @xcite , and perform a systematic analysis of their features ( see section [ sec : general_description ] ) .",
    "we then proceed to investigate the inertial sensitivity properties of these peculiar setups , which will be referred to as _ asymmetric _",
    "talbot - lau interferometers .",
    "our analysis of the inertial sensitivity shows that the absolute fringe displacement scales quadratically with the magnification factor in asymmetric configurations .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sec : inertial_sensitivity ] .    in a previous paper",
    "we discussed the possible experimental applications of talbot - lau setups in the interferometry of antimatter particles ( e.g. , positrons and positronium ( ps ) atoms @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting development can be the measurement of the gravitational acceleration of neutral antimatter with talbot - lau interferometers , as opposed to classical moir deflectometers @xcite . with this application in mind",
    ", we compare the standard and asymmetric talbot - lau interferometers of the same total length in order to establish whether there is a systematic advantage in using an asymmetric setup , with respect to period magnification and inertial sensitivity ( see sections [ sec : asymmetric_setups ] and [ sec : inertial_sensitivity ] ) . in this case",
    "we find that the gain in the absolute inertial fringe displacement is effectively limited , and also that the relative displacement @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the fringe period ) vanishes for high magnification factor .",
    "the magnitude of the fringe period instead scales favourably with the magnification factor , which can be a relevant advantage when the experimental resolution is a concern , as it is for example the case of low energy electrons or positrons @xcite .    for these reasons ,",
    "the best trade - off when designing an inertial sensor based on a talbot - lau interferometer has to be found given the specific properties of the particle beam .",
    "the numerical analysis of section [ sec : monte_carlo ] indicates that asymmetric configurations are useful for this purpose due to their peculiar properties .",
    "a satisfactory theoretical treatment of grating matter - wave interferometers exploits the analogy with classical scalar diffraction theory @xcite .",
    "this is justified by the formal correspondence existing between the time evolution of the wave function calculated via the schrdinger equation , and the fresnel - kirchhoff diffraction integral @xcite for a classical scalar field of wavelength @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass and velocity of the particle , respectively .",
    "the talbot - lau interferometer , sketched and described in fig .",
    "[ fig : asimm2 ] can operate on incoherent uncollimated beams .",
    "this result is known as the lau effect @xcite and originates from the matching of the periodicity of the coherence function generated by the first grating , acting as a pure intensity mask , with the period of the second grating , @xmath9 @xcite . for a general discussion of the coherence properties of particle beams and the coherence requirements of different interferometers",
    "see @xcite . for our current purposes",
    ", it is sufficient to recall that the intensity pattern produced by a fully incoherent beam can be modeled by integrating the intensity distribution of point sources placed on the plane of the first grating @xcite . schematically , the intensity pattern measured at the detection plane is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the intensity pattern produced by a monochromatic point source of wavelength @xmath12 illuminating the second grating from the point @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath14 is the transmission function of the first grating @xcite . in the case of non - monochromatic beams ( as considered in section [ sec : monte_carlo ] ) , the intensity pattern @xmath15 is found by further integrating @xmath16 weighted by the probability distribution @xmath17 , or equivalently the speed distribution @xmath18 : @xmath19        the fresnel integral formalism can not easily take into account the presence of an external force acting on the interfering particles .",
    "we will thus employ an equivalent description of the talbot - lau interferometer based on the wigner function @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to incorporate a constant acceleration @xmath0 in a straightforward manner @xcite , and has been used to obtain the intensity pattern for symmetric configurations ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) in the presence of a transverse acceleration @xcite .",
    "the same theoretical framework has also been applied to the asymmetric setups of our interest ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , but the external force was neglected @xcite .",
    "we now present a general calculation that takes both effects into account .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we introduce the wigner function phase - space representation of the quantum state of the particle within the interferometer , given its density operator @xmath24 : @xmath25 we recall that the relevant degrees of freedom are the _ transverse _ center - of - mass position and momentum ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively ) , whereas the longitudinal motion ( along the @xmath28-axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : asimm2 ] ) is assumed to be essentially classical .",
    "specifically , uniform motion satisfying @xmath29 where @xmath8 is the longitudinal speed of the particle",
    ". this relation links time to the longitudinal space evolution of the interference pattern . .",
    "for example for the case of a linear potential of the form @xmath30 , that is one resulting in a constant acceleration @xmath0 along the @xmath26-direction , the wigner function evolved at time @xmath31 given the initial state @xmath32 at @xmath33 , reads @xcite : @xmath34 the intensity distribution at the time @xmath31 , namely , @xmath35 , is then given by the marginal distribution @xmath36 to describe a talbot - lau interferometer , the transformation induced on the wigner function by the interaction with the gratings is needed .",
    "we assume that the action of the latter on the incoming single - particle state , represented by the wavefunction @xmath37 , can be modelled by a transmission function @xmath38 .",
    "the wavefunction after the grating is then @xmath39 , and the corresponding transformation on the wigner function reads : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is defined as @xcite : @xmath42    @xmath43 where we denoted with @xmath44 the longitudinal momentum , @xmath45 is the transverse momentum distribution , and @xmath46 is a suitable normalization factor .",
    "the initial state , first undergoes free evolution for a time @xmath47 , governed by equation .",
    "the grating transformation is then applied with the transmission function @xmath48 of @xmath49 , followed by free evolution for a time @xmath50 to obtain the wigner function at the detection plane : @xmath51 ( see appendix [ app : b ] for the explicit calculation ) .",
    "finally , it is apparent that the effect of a nonzero acceleration @xmath0 is to rigidly displace the fringe pattern by the following quantity : @xmath52 which is proportional to @xmath53 as anticipated .",
    "we fully discuss the inertial displacement in section [ sec : inertial_sensitivity ] .",
    "being based on the transmission function formalism , this model is very general and can be applied to a wide range of particles and diffraction gratings at @xmath49 , pure intensity masks as well as phase gratings that alter the phase of the incoming wavefunction .",
    "furthermore , this treatment can also account for a broad range of particle - gratings interactions ; examples include the van der waals atom - surface interaction @xcite or electrostatic forces for charged particles @xcite .",
    "sufficiently weak interactions in particular result in a reduced _ effective _ slit width @xcite , that has also been observed experimentally @xcite . for stronger interactions , a more general approach beyond the eikonal approximation @xcite can still make use of this formalism .",
    "the properties of the general equation are now discussed in detail for the cases of our interest .",
    "first of all we note that equation , describing the statistical interference fringe pattern in a talbot - lau interferometer , is a fourier series expansion with a magnified period @xmath54 .",
    "the dependence on the length @xmath55 only enters through the dimensionless ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the factor @xmath57 can also be less than unity , however we are particularly interested in the case @xmath58 , therefore , from now on we will refer to @xmath57 as the _ magnification factor_. as we mentioned , the properties of the gratings are encoded in the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we now specialise our analysis to gratings described by the following ( single period ) transmission function : @xmath61\\\\ z & \\mbox{if } \\quad x \\in [ fd , d ] , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath62 are two complex numbers , @xmath63 is the grating period , and @xmath64 the _ open fraction _ of the grating .",
    "this form is particularly convenient since , upon writing the fourier expansion @xmath65 , we have the following analytical expression for the fourier coefficients : @xmath66 partial transparency of the grating substrate together with a possible ( constant ) phase added could be accounted for by a suitable choice of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . however , in the rest of this paper we set @xmath69 and @xmath70 , to describe material gratings realised as open slits in a substrate @xcite .",
    "the open fraction then corresponds to the ratio between the slit width and the grating period .",
    "furthermore , in the following we drop the explicit dependence of the fourier coefficients on the parameters @xmath71 as the two gratings @xmath72 and @xmath49 are assumed to have the same open fraction and transmission properties .",
    "now we look for the resonance conditions of equation , i.e. , the set of parameters @xmath73 that maximises the visibility of the pattern .",
    "we recall that the visibility or contrast @xmath74 of the fringe pattern @xmath15 is defined as @xmath75 since the function @xmath15 is a fourier series , one can truncate the summation to the lowest orders , and consider the visibility of the resulting sinusoidal function as a good approximation of the actual visibility .",
    "this parameter is called the _ sinusoidal visibility _ @xcite , and for equation it reads : @xmath76 the constant coefficients @xmath77 are the zeroth - order fourier coefficients of @xmath78 , the intensity transmission function of the first grating ( for the case @xmath79 and @xmath80 it coincides with the transmission function itself ) .",
    "equation suggests the modulus of the @xmath81-th talbot coefficient as a good estimator of the pattern visibility . the requirement that @xmath81 , defined in , is an integer allows to enumerate different families of _ resonance conditions _ as a function of the physical parameters , in particular we focus on the following choices :    [ eqn : resonance_2 ] @xmath82    we can see that the magnification factor determines the ratio of the two grating periods . the most common standard talbot - lau setup ( that we will refer to as the _ symmetric setup _ ) belongs to the case @xmath83 , and has @xmath21 , implying that @xmath84 . in the following",
    "we will study the interesting properties of the _ asymmetric setup _ with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the value of @xmath81 determines the relevant talbot coefficients influencing the visibility , respectively @xmath87 for the asymmetric case , and @xmath88 for the standard symmetric setup .",
    "we now turn our attention to the @xmath89 dependence of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the two functions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : talbotcoeffplots ] for different values of the open fraction @xmath64 . the position of the relative maximum of the relevant talbot coefficient sets the _ resonance _ condition on the length .",
    "for instance we see that for the @xmath87 , this always occurs for @xmath92 , whereas the behaviour of @xmath88 is more irregular and depends on the open fraction .",
    "assuming for definiteness that the maximum occurs for @xmath93 , and using the definition , we obtain : @xmath94 where the periods of the gratings and magnification factor @xmath57 have to satisfy either of the conditions ( or any other combination corresponding to an integer value of @xmath81 , defined by ) .",
    "quantum diffraction takes place at the second grating , so in this general configuration with @xmath95 , it is @xmath9 that sets the relevant length scale trough the talbot length @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , as a manifestation of the underlying talbot effect , resonance is possible also at higher integer multiples of @xmath97 .",
    "this is reflected in the periodicity of the talbot coefficients in their argument @xmath98 .",
    "the case of a symmetric setup ( @xmath99 ) with @xmath100 is peculiar , and does not satisfy the same resonance conditions , since is is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : talbotcoeffplots ] that it achieves a maximum visibility for @xmath101 .",
    "the case @xmath100 is also critical in the classical case : the visibility of a classical moir deflectometer with @xmath100 is exactly zero @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that if an asymmetric setup is employed , all the chosen values of open fraction , including @xmath100 , behave similarly .",
    "we will analyse the consequences of this property in section [ sec : monte_carlo ] .      in order to study the effect of the asymmetric configuration on the interference pattern , it is useful to start from a specific example . choosing the resonance condition , interference pattern is given by the general equation .",
    "the relevant properties of the interference patterns can be summarised in a _",

    "the maximum occurs at @xmath111 , as predicted in section [ sec : general_description ] .",
    "note that the shape of the peak differs from the plots of fig .",

    "this correspondence will be further discussed , also in the asymmetric configuration , in section [ sec : moire ] .",
    "the displacement is quadratic in the magnification factor @xmath57 .",
    "this is an interesting property that might be of great help in those experimental situations where the total length of the setup is limited by the properties of the interfering particles .",
    "for example if they have a finite lifetime @xcite , or need to propagate in vacuum , under shielding from stray fields or in a cryogenic environment @xcite . an interesting potential application for a talbot - lau inertial sensor",

    "it is apparent that at a fixed total length @xmath112 , increasing the asymmetry factor @xmath57 also reduces @xmath2 , and the dependence on both parameters of @xmath3 is quadratic .",
    "for this reason we apply the same reasoning of section [ sec : asymmetric_setups ] to find if there is a systematic gain in the inertial displacement from symmetric to asymmetric setups of the same length .",
    "now we evaluate the displacement per unit interferometer length , namely : @xmath127 in the symmetric and asymmetric case under the constraint . using the same notation of section [ sec : asymmetric_setups ]",
    ", one can prove that ( assuming @xmath128 ) : @xmath129 this factor is greater than unity , but it is limited to a maximum value of @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "however , already for @xmath104 one can magnify the _ fall _ of the beam by @xmath132 with respect to a symmetric configuration of the same length .",
    "this can already be a sizeable gain for some specific applications .    from a practical point of view",
    ", it can be proven @xcite , that the relative uncertainty @xmath133 with which the acceleration @xmath0 can be measured by detecting a shift @xmath3 in a fringe pattern with period @xmath5 and contrast @xmath74 reads : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the number of data points forming the pattern , which depends on the beam intensity and the efficiency of the detector .",
    "furthermore , the contrast is mainly influenced by the longitudinal velocity spread of the incoming particles . for a non - monochromatic beam the intensity pattern",
    "is easily recovered by integrating over the speed distribution ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the result is in general a loss in visibility that depends on the width of the velocity distribution ( see section [ sec : monte_carlo ] ) .",

    "@xmath4 , where we recall that @xmath5 is the period of the interference fringes .",
    "it is thus useful to derive an expression for the ratio in the two cases of our interest .",

    "we introduced @xmath137 for the total flight time from the first grating to the detection plane , namely @xmath138 .    on the one hand",
    ", equation tells that to improve the sensitivity , the relative displacement @xmath4 should be maximised . on the other hand",

    "we can physically motivate the dependence of eqs .   and from the particle mass : for a fixed total interferometer length and longitudinal speed @xmath8 , any particle subjected to the same acceleration @xmath0 , will undergo the same transverse displacement , according to equation .",
    "however , the heavier the particle , the smaller its de broglie wavelength would be , thus leading to shorter periods for the two gratings and for the resulting fringe pattern . following this line of reasoning , the ratio @xmath4 is expected to increase with the particle mass .",
    "the relative displacement for the symmetric setup instead reads : @xmath139^{3/2}. \\label{eqn : relative_symm}\\ ] ] first we remark that it does not coincide with the result of equation for @xmath21 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the two configurations belong to two different sets of resonance conditions with different relevant talbot coefficients , as discussed in section [ sec : general_description ] . as a matter of fact",
    "the  asymmetric configuration with @xmath21 \" differs from the standard symmetric setup because @xmath140 in the former , whereas @xmath84 in the latter ; as required by .",
    "even in this case we have @xmath141 at the same total length , so we see that the asymmetric setups we studied always provide a smaller relative displacement in the presence of a constant acceleration .",
    "this property , according to equation can be a disadvantage if the aim is to measure the acceleration @xmath0 with great accuracy .",
    "however , in some realistic experimental situations it may be preferable to have a larger absolute displacement at the expense of the relative shift ( for instance , due to the finite detector resolution ) .    ) .",
    "it is apparent that the asymmetric setup always provides a smaller relative displacement under the acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "the absolute displacement is , however , always larger , as shown in the bottom panel .",
    "a smaller relative displacement is not desirable for inertial measurements , but also implies a reduced sensitivity to external disturbances .",
    "generally the best trade off has to be found depending on the specific experimental application.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a comparison of eqs .   and",
    "suggests that the impact of random external perturbations on the pattern visibility is effectively reduced by using a magnifying setup of the same length .",
    "an example is the lorentz force acing on charged particle due to stray electromagnetic fields @xcite . to summarise the results of this section , figure [",
    "fig : plots_scaling ] displays the scaling with @xmath57 of the parameters we studied .",
    "a moir deflectometer , as described in @xcite , is a two - grating setup completely analogous to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asimm2 ] .",
    "the crucial difference is that the grating periods @xmath142 and the length @xmath143 are chosen to satisfy the constraint @xcite : @xmath144 therefore , quantum diffraction is negligible .",
    "we introduced the superscript @xmath145 to denote the grating periods and length of the classical configuration .",
    "equation implies that a given resonant talbot - lau setup with parameters @xmath146 at fixed de broglie wavelength @xmath147 , can be made into a classical device by changing the grating periods to larger values : @xmath148 for @xmath149 .",
    "on the other hand one could decrease the length and keep the same gratings , so that @xmath150 .",
    "however , since we are interested in inertial sensing application and the fringe displacement strongly depends on the length , in the following we always assume that the first route is taken when comparing the two devices .",
    "for this reason , a moir deflectometer will always produce a fringe system with a larger period than the talbot - lau setup of the same length tuned for the same particle beam .",
    "we now derive in very simple terms the main features of the classical fringe pattern in the presence of an external acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "let us suppose that the incoming particle with speed @xmath8 starts with a transverse position and speed @xmath151 , on a plane located at a distance @xmath152 before the first grating . from the laws of uniformly accelerated motion it is then straightforward to write the following system of equations :    @xmath153    where @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 are the @xmath26-positions of the particle on the plane of @xmath72 , @xmath49 and the detector respectively , @xmath2 and @xmath157 being the corresponding times of flight . after some algebraic manipulations we can eliminate the dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath158 , solving for @xmath156 as a function of @xmath155 and @xmath155 : @xmath159 it is worth noting that equation does not depend on the initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath158 : only the dynamics after the first grating are relevant .",
    "the same expression could have been obtained by assuming initial conditions on the plane of @xmath154 .",
    "one also sees that the displacement due to @xmath0 is the sum of two contributions depending on both times of flight , as expected since the force acts in both regions .",
    "equation must be coupled with the requirement that the intermediate arrival positions onto the gratings are contained in the support of the gratings transmission function .",
    "to get an intuitive picture we implement this requirement by the simple replacements @xmath160 that constrain the @xmath26-positions to be exact multiples @xmath161 and @xmath7 , respectively , of the grating periods .",
    "this substitution , together with @xmath50 yields : @xmath162 a physically interesting periodic pattern arises if the grating periods and @xmath57 are chosen to cast equation in the form : @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is an integer number that depends on @xmath165 and @xmath166 is the period of the fringes , generally depending on @xmath57 .",
    "for example , the standard moir deflectometer , defined by @xmath167 and @xmath168 is a suitable choice .",
    "however , we observe that also by using the asymmetric resonance conditions we obtain the following expression @xmath169 meaning that the final position is a multiple of @xmath170 . as we anticipated , the last line shows that period magnification and @xmath0-dependent fringe displacement have the exact features in the classical and quantum description of the setup of fig.[fig : asimm2 ] . given this similarity",
    ", all the considerations made about the sensitivity ( see equation ) remain valid .",
    "an important remark is that all other parameters being equal , the requirement @xmath148 causes the classical configuration to always produce a smaller relative displacement @xmath4 , thus generally lowering the sensitivity .",
    "however , the properties of the quantum and classical fringe patterns are markedly different .",
    "for example in the moir deflectometer the visibility is independent of the particle energy @xcite , as also shown in section [ sec : monte_carlo ] .",
    "this is why we carefully referred to the output of the moir deflectometer as _",
    "geometrical shadow _ patterns , in contrast with the genuine quantum interference fringes of a talbot - lau interferometer .",
    "in the talbot - lau interferometer , the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath3 appearing in equation for the inertial sensitivity , strongly depend on the longitudinal speed distribution @xmath18 of the particle beam . this section is devoted to a numerical analysis of this dependence .    for definiteness",
    ", we will assume that the function @xmath18 is a .",
    "hence we can write the general expression : @xmath171 as eqs .   and suggest , the intensity for a non - monochromatic beam in the presence of an external force has the general structure :    @xmath172    where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are given by eqs .   and respectively , and we highlighted the parametric dependence on @xmath8 for clarity . since there is a dependence on the integration variable both from the argument and in the functional form of @xmath15 , the second equality is in principle an approximation .",
    "the effective displacement @xmath175 we just introduced , is what contributes to the sensitivity of the apparatus in eq .  , and depends on @xmath176 ( see appendix [ app : c ] for more details ) .",
    "the intensity factor @xmath135 , can always be defined as @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the beam intensity at the detector and a @xmath179 is the integration time .",
    "as we will show , the visibility of a talbot - lau pattern is very sensitive to the @xmath8-distribution , so in many realistic particle beams , a velocity selection could be needed . in these cases",
    "the factor @xmath178 ( and in turn @xmath135 ) depends on @xmath176 as well , and the best trade - off between visibility ( decreasing with @xmath176 ) and statistics ( increasing with @xmath176 ) has to be found . since this study is specific to each experimental situation , in the following we only focus on the functions @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
