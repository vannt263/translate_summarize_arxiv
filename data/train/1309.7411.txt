    "in recent years ultracold atoms in optical cavities have revealed themselves as attractive new systems for studying strongly - interacting quantum many - body theories .",
    "their high degree of tunability makes them especially attractive for this purpose .",
    "one example , which has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally , is the dicke quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from the normal phase to the superradiant phase with a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "the dicke model @xcite describes a large number of two - level atoms interacting with a single cavity field mode , and predicts the existence of the dicke qpt @xcite from the normal phase to the superradiant phase .",
    "however , it is very hard to observe the dicke qpt in the standard dicke model , since the critical collective atom - field coupling strength needs to be of the same order as the energy separation between the two atomic levels .",
    "fortunately , strong collective atom - field coupling has realized experimentally in a bec coupling with a ultrahigh - finesse cavity filed @xcite .",
    "employing the cavity - bec system , the dicke qpt has been observed experimentally through an atom - field coupling between a motional degree of freedom of the bec and the cavity field @xcite .",
    "the dicke qpt corresponds to the process of self - organization of atoms @xcite . in the experimental realization of the dicke qpt based on the cavity - bec system @xcite",
    ", the normal phase corresponds to the bec being in the ground state associated with vacuum cavity field state while both the bec and cavity field have collective excitations in the super - radiant phase .",
    "a few extended dicke models @xcite have been proposed to reveal rich phase diagrams and exotic qpts , which are different from those in the original dicke model .    in this paper , motivated by the recent experimental progress of cavity - bec and impurity - doped bec systems @xcite",
    "we propose a generalized dicke model , an impurity - doped dicke model ( iddm ) , by the use of an impurity - doped cavity - bec . in our model",
    ", the impurity atom is an internal two - level system .",
    "the impurity - bec interaction is tunable by an external magnetic field in the vicinity of feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "the cavity - bec system adopted in our scheme is the same as that in the dicke qpt experiment @xcite .",
    "the iddm can reduce to the original dicke model when the impurity - bec interaction is switched off .",
    "we discuss how the presence of an impurity atom modifies the results of the original dicke model .",
    "we show that the impurity atom can induce the dicke qpt from the normal phase to the superradiant phase with the impurity population being the qpt parameter .",
    "it is found that the iddm exhibits continuous dicke qpt with an infinite number of critical points , which is different from that observed in the standard dicke model with only one critical point .",
    "it is predicted that the impurity - induced dicke qpt can happen in an arbitrary coupling regime of the cavity field and atoms while the dicke qpt in the standard dicke model occurs only in the strong coupling regime of the cavity field and atoms .",
    "this opens a possibility to observe the dicke qpt in the intermediate and even weak coupling regime of the cavity field and atoms .",
    "we propose a scheme to control the impurity population in the cavity - bec through making quantum measurements on an auxiliary atom outside the cavity , which is correlated to the impurity atom in the cavity - bec .",

    "iii , we investigate qpt properties of the iddm and show the presence of continuous dicke qpt with an infinite number of critical points in the iddm .",
    "we also analyze the impurity - population dependence of the dicke qpt , and show how to manipulate the impurity - population in the cavity - bec system .",

    "( 18 ) the critical parameter @xmath90 at the qpt point can vary continuously since the cavity - field - atom coupling strength @xmath86 can be manipulated continuously .",
    "this implies that the impurity - induced qpt in the iddm is a continuous qpt in which a quantum system can undergo a continuous phase transition at the absolute zero of temperature as some parameter entering its hamiltonian is varied continuously @xcite . from the critical - point equation",

    "the cavity - field - atom coupling strength @xmath86 is the qpt parameter while the impurity population @xmath87 is an arbitrary fixed parameter .",

    "from the qpt equation ( 16 ) we can find that the critical parameter @xmath105 at the qpt point satisfies the following equation @xmath106    obviously , the cavity - field - atom coupling induced qpt in the iddm is also a continuous qpt in which the qpt parameter can vary continuously by changing the impurity population . from equation ( 20 ) , we can find the critical coupling strength to be @xmath107 which indicates that the critical coupling strength @xmath108 can continuously vary with the impurity population @xmath87 ( @xmath109 ) .",
