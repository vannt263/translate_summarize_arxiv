    "the counter - intuitive and one of the most striking features of the quantum world is entanglement , which has found practical use in the field of communication and cryptography [ 1 ] .",
    "various quantum communication protocols , like qubit teleportation [ 2,3 ] , superdense coding [ 4 ] , quantum information splitting [ 5 ] , secret sharing [ 6 ] , remote state preparation [ 7,8 ] have been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated through entangled channels .",
    "gate teleportation is another important protocol implementing a multi - partite quantum gates between qubits , which are spatially distributed .",
    "the protocol requires application of a unitary gate , that can not be decomposed into individual local operations i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "this can be achieved using entangled channels shared by the remote parties . in the context of distributed quantum computing ,",
    "it is necessary to produce controlled operations between remote parties , which may be more than two in number .",
    "together with the local single particle operations , these can produce the necessary entanglement between remote parties for implementation of quantum tasks .",
    "as is well known , controlled - not , together with the single qubit hadamard gate , form the universal gates to which other gates can be decomposed [ 9 ] . controlled - unitary gates play significant role in quantum computation . in principle , these gates can be teleported , using only cnot gate teleportation protocol . involving less entanglement and communication costs ,",
    "several protocols have been carried out implementing non - local multi - partite operations locally by locc using entangled channels[10 - 20 ] and qubit communication [ 21,22 ] .",
    "probabilistic and deterministic gate teleportation using non - maximally entangled state has been exploited [ 23 - 26 ] . assisted with linear optical manipulations , photon entanglement produced from parametric down - conversion , and post - selection from the coincidence measurements , huang _ et al .",
    "_ [ 27 ] teleported the cnot gate experimentally .",
    "in contrast with the other protocols , we consider arbitrary multipartite state , either product or entangled , where all the qubits are remote placed and explicate the protocol of simultaneous and ` n ' qubit controlled operation in two different entanglement distribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a three party scenario , where alice and bob simultaneously teleport controlled - unitary gate to charlie in parallel entangled network , which is then generalized for arbitrary multi - partite state . sect .",
    "ii deals the series entanglement distribution of bell states among three distant parties to simultaneously teleport controlled - hermitian gates on ` @xmath5 ' remote parties .",
    "we then proceed to teleport controlled - controlled - unitary gate and generalize it to @xmath5-controlled ( @xmath5 parties having the controls ) unitary gate teleportation .",
    "iv is devoted to conclusion and directions for future work .",
    "in this configuration , we start with a system of three parties ( fig .",
    "1 ) , where alice and bob are two control parties and charlie is the target party .",
    "the three qubit arbitrary state is possessed by the parties having one qubit each .",
    "alice and charlie share one epr pair between a and @xmath6 : @xmath7 bob and charlie share another epr pair between b and @xmath8 : @xmath9 thus there is no connection between the control parties and each of the control parties shares entanglement with the target party forming a parallel entanglement connection .",

    "the simultaneous remote teleportation of controlled - hermitian gate from two parties to one consumes 2 ebits and total 5 cbits to communicate the measurement outcomes .",

    "5 . for n parties",
    "the communication cost is @xmath0 ebits and @xmath2 cbits .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the interesting feature of the series network , which enables a party , not directly connected to the target , to control an operation on the same .",
    "we could not find any protocol where controlled - unitary gate can be teleported using this entanglement cost .",
    "so , from the above protocol , we can say that the unitary as well as hermitian operators has significance in series entangled network .",
    "this operator has the additional property of involution ( i.e. , the operator is same as its inverse ) , which is responsible for making this protocol deterministic .",
    "most of the important gates like controlled - pauli gates , controlled - hadamard gate etc .",
    ", belong to this category , making this implementation powerful .",
    "it has been shown that a more general form of toffoli gate , i.e. , controlled - controlled - unitary gate can be deterministically teleported in parallel network , using two bell pairs ( 2 ebits of entanglement ) and 4 cbits to communicate the measurement outcomes [ 10 ] . in this present protocol we implement that same non - local gate using series entanglement distribution with the same communication cost , given in figure 4 .    for illustration , we consider the qubit distribution described in eq . 9 : @xmath23    * step 1 * : alice first applies controlled - not gates @xmath24 and measure her qubit 2 in computational basis .",

    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated gate teleportation protocols of simultaneous controlled gate operations in two different configurations , which are efficient , as evident from the associated communication and entanglement costs .",
    "all the protocols have been generalized to ` n'-qubit gates .",
    "interestingly , in the series configuration , the implemented generalized gate and communication cost is different from the parallel distribution for the simultaneous gate teleportation .",
    "optimal protocol can be investigated for the simulstaneous controlled - unitary gate teleportation in series entangled channels . in parallel to the qubit case of remote state preparation , the gate teleportation with partial information needs to be investigated [ 7,8 ] . the fact that , bell states are realized in laboratory conditions makes our protocol experimentally achievable [ 3 ] . in future",
