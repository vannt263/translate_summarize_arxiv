    "<S> hadron spectra in au+au collisions at rhic are calculated by hydrodynamics with initial conditions from the color glass condensate ( cgc ) . </S>",
    "<S> minijet components with parton energy loss in medium are also taken into account by using parton density obtained from hydrodynamical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that cgc provides a good initial condition for hydrodynamics in au+au collisions at rhic .    </S>",
    "<S> high energy heavy ion collisions involve different aspects according to the relevant energy or time scale . </S>",
    "<S> there already exist many theoretical approaches to understand numerous rhic data . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we consider in particular physics of gluon saturation , hydrodynamic evolution , and the energy loss of hard partons in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> our goals are to combine them and to take a step to a unified understanding of the dynamical aspect of high energy heavy ion collisions .    at soft region </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 gev / c , where bulk dynamics is governed , hydrodynamical description  @xcite is successful in describing the elliptic flow at low @xmath1 , up to semi - central collisions , and mid - rapidity  @xcite at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the strongest indications of an early thermalization of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamics also predicts that the scaled elliptic flow , which is defined as the second harmonics @xmath2 divided by initial spatial eccentricity @xmath3 , becomes almost constant around 0.2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data reaches the hydrodynamic limit for the first time in central and semi - central collisions at rhic energies  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> minijets go across the expanding matter and lose their energies ( jet quenching ) in heavy ion collisions  @xcite . observed large suppression of hadron spectra  @xcite and disappearance of the away - side peak in azimuthal correlation functions at mid - rapidity  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have been interpreted as a consequence of parton energy loss in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , cronin enhancement of the hadron spectra and existence of the back - to - back correlation at mid - rapidity in @xmath4 collisions at rhic  @xcite support the importance of the strong final state interaction in @xmath5 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the current rhic data strongly suggest that the initial parton density is large . </S>",
    "<S> what is an origin of the large density in au+au collisions at rhic ? </S>",
    "<S> the bulk particle production is dominated by the small @xmath6 modes in the nuclear wave function , where @xmath6 is a momentum fraction of the incident particles . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that gluon density increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath6 by the bfkl cascade until gluons begin to overlap in phase space where nonlinear interaction becomes important  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these gluons form the colour glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the cgc results on the global observables such as the centrality , rapidity and the energy dependences of charged hadron multiplicities agree with the rhic data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the classical wave function in the mv model contains cronin enhancement and the quantum evolution in @xmath6 makes the spectrum suppressed  @xcite .    from the above considerations , </S>",
    "<S> the cgc , hydrodynamics , and the energy loss of hard partons are key ingredients to describe the rhic physics and must be closely related with each other . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the cgc could be a good initial condition for thermalization because it produces a large number of gluons . </S>",
    "<S> thus these gluons are responsible to the large suppression of jet spectra . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the origin of thermalized partonic matter is the cgc in high energy heavy ion collisions , and use it as an initial condition in the hydro+jet model  @xcite . with this approach </S>",
    "<S> we expect to get deeper understanding of the dynamical aspect of the heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some of the problems which are inherent in a particular approach can be removed . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the @xmath7 factorized formula along the line of kharzeev , levin , and nardi ( kln )  @xcite for the computation of the gluon rapidity distribution which is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath1 are a rapidity and a transverse momentum of a produced gluon . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the system of initially produced gluons reaches local thermailzed state at a short time scale . </S>",
    "<S> although the produced gluons will reach the thermalized state through the dissipative processes in the realistic situations , the description of non - equilibrium phenomena is beyond the scope of the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that the shape of the rapidity density distribution is not changed during the system is thermalized . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we take initial conditions from gluon distribution obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ktfac ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming bjorken s ansatz @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the space - time rapidity , we obtain the number or the energy density for gluons at each space - time point .    the initial transverse energy per particle yields @xmath13 gev at @xmath14 from eq .  ( [ eq : ktfac ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is within a range estimated in a numerical simulation of the classical yang - mills equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the assumption of the thermalization in cgc gluon distribution is to reduce the transverse energy per particle from @xmath15 to @xmath16 within our present parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the hydrodynamic afterburner is to reduce the transverse energy per particles due to @xmath17 work and yields @xmath18 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity distribution becomes slightly wider . </S>",
    "<S> our result supports that kln calculation  @xcite which is based on the assumption of parton - hadron duality is a good approximation on the rapidity distributions .     and </S>",

    "<S> @xmath7 factorization approach in the cgc provides very good initial conditions for the hydrodynamical simulations which reproduce rapidity , centrality and energy dependences of multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that it is very hard to find such a good initial condition which fits the data with the same quality as the cgc one presented here .     </S>",

    "<S> high @xmath1 jets suffer interaction with the local parton density which is governed by hydrodynamic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we only take into account parton energy loss in deconfined matter @xmath22 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : raa45 ] , the result of the centrality dependence of the pion spectrum and the nuclear modification factor @xmath23 integrated over @xmath24 gev / c for @xmath25 are compared to phenix data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results only account for the data up to mid - central events and fail to reproduce data at peripheral collisions , because neither cgc nor hydrodynamics can be applied in the low density region . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality dependence is well described by assuming the number of participants scaling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that our density scales as @xmath26 at mid - rapidity . by comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also plot the lopqcd calculations with the same initial condition assuming ( 1 + 1)d expansion of the system ( @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> lopqcd calculation without parton energy loss at @xmath28 mev is consistent with our hydrodynamic result . </S>",
    "<S> however , if there is no restriction on the minimum temperature in the calculation of energy loss , we see that agreement with data becomes somewhat better . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate the contribution from hadronic interactions at peripheral collisions .    in summary , cgc , hydrodynamics and </S>",
    "<S> the energy loss of hard jets have been integrated into one model and this dynamical approach describes the bulk properties of rhic data . </S>",
