    "cover and el gamal @xcite proved some capacity theorems for a single relay channel . in a collaborative network , users may collaborate to transmit message of other users while handling their own private messages ; this can be regarded as a generalization of the traditional relay channel .",
    "we present a pairwise relaying collaboration model where a pair of transmitter and receiver collaborates with the source pair in delivering the message of the source pair along with its own private message .",
    "our proposed model differs from previous research in that we consider collaboration schemes that the transmitter and receiver of the relay pair handles a private message , which , to the best of our knowledge , no previous work has considered in this setting .",
    "figure  [ fig : nettopology ] represents such a network where the 1st user , intends to send a message to the 4th user , and the 2nd user to the 3rd user .",
    "we propose two collaboration schemes where in the first scheme , the transmitter of the relay pair , the 1st user , splits its message into two independent parts .",
    "the relay pair collaborates with the source pair via decode and forward coding to transmit a part of the message of the source pair and the private message of the relay pair . in the second scheme",
    "the relay pair partially cancels the interference of other users and sends the compressed observed signal to the intended receiver of source pair , the 4th user .",

    "numerical result shows that the collaboration offers capacity gain when the channel gain between the source pair is week and the corresponding channel between relay users is strong .",

    "we consider the awgn pcn with @xmath113 and @xmath114 and we examine the proposed collaboration scheme under different channel conditions .",
    "we compare the achievable rate region of the proposed scheme with the scheme where pairs do not collaborate , i.e. interference channel .",

    "figure  [ fig : rates ] demonstrates the trade off between the achieved rate region of the source and relay pairs .",
    "the achievable rate region of the source pair expands as the transmitter increases its transmit power .",
    "similar to the source pair , increasing the transmit power of the relay pair increases the achievable rate of the relay pair .",
    "first we investigate the case where the communication channel between the source pair is poor .",
    "the channel condition @xmath116 and @xmath117 exemplifies such a condition .",
    "figure  [ fig : rate1 ] shows the rate region of the involved pairs employing the proposed collaboration scheme in conjunction with rate region of interference channel .",
    "we observe that under this condition , collaboration offers small capacity gain .",
    "we also observe that the relay pair has incentive to collaborate and obtain more rate than interference channel , only if the source pair demands for more rate .",
    "we plotted the line @xmath118 to investigate the achievable rate on condition that both pairs demands equal rates , i.e. @xmath115 .",
    "we observe that under this condition collaboration is not beneficial .    exploiting strong communication links between the 1st and the 2nd users and between the 3rd and the 4th users , pairs obtain a considerable capacity gain which is shown in figure  [ fig : rate2 ] with @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    ". in this scenario , the source pair is suffering from poor direct channel gain , between the 1st and the 4th users , however , the communication channel between pair users to relay users is strong . in that case collaboration enhances the achievable rate of both pairs .",
    "it also offers dramatic gain if both pairs are interested in equal rates .",
    "collaboration only improves the achievable rate if the direct link between relay pair , i.e. the 2nd and the 3rd user , is strong .",
    "otherwise as shown in figure  [ fig : rate3 ] , with @xmath121 and @xmath120 , collaboration does not enlarge the rate region .",
    "however , increasing the channel gain between the 3rd and 4th users and between the 1st and the 2nd , the pairs gain as much as the non collaborative scheme ( see figure  [ fig : rate4 ] ) , with @xmath122 and @xmath117 .",
    "this emphasizes that the efficiency of proposed scheme significantly depends on the channel gain between the relay users .",
    "lastly , in equal channel condition for both pairs , i.e. @xmath123 and @xmath120 ( figure  [ fig : rate5 ] ) , the channel gain between the 1st and the 2nd users and between the 3rd and the 4th users , increases the capacity gain for involved pairs .",
    "we have considered a network of collaborative transmitter - receiver pairs in which one pair ( relay pair ) acts as relay to assist the source pair in delivering the message of the source pair as well as its own private message .",
