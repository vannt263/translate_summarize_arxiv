    "according to recent advances in the formation theory of population iii ( pop iii ) stars , it has been understood that they could be very massive @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "those stars end up as black holes as massive as @xmath2 ( here after pop iii bhs ) , in the case that the mass of the progenitor stars is within the range @xmath3 or @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the accretion disks formed around such black holes can emit a significant amount of soft x - rays , which can contribute to reionization of the universe @xcite",
    ". moreover , such black holes could be candidates for the progenitors of ultra - luminous x - ray sources @xcite or the building blocks of super - massive black holes @xcite .",
    "the accretion disks surrounding pop iii bhs are formed from the accreting gas around the progenitor stars . in the case",
    "that the mass of a pop iii star is within the range @xmath3 or @xmath5 , the star forms a black hole directly without a sn @xcite . in this case",
    ", the accreting gas is expected to contain a small amount of heavy elements .",
    "in addition , recent numerical simulations on low - mass galaxy formation , taking into account the effects of sne feedback , suggest that the metallicity of the gas remain in such galaxies during their early star - burst phase is as low as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the metallicity of the accretion disks surrounding pop iii bhs is expected to be very low ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we hereafter call these accretion disks as pop iii disks .    the thermal instability of the standard accretion disk has been investigated in detail ( e.g , ; ; ) . by assuming solar metallicity ( hereafter pop i disks ) , mineshige and osaki ( ) obtained the s - shaped equilibrium loci on the @xmath0 ( mass accretion rate v.s .",
    "surface density ) plane , implying that the unstable disk undergoes limit - cycle oscillation between the upper , hot , ionised branch and the lower , cool neutral branch ( see also ; ; ; for a review ) .",
    "it is so - called dwarf - nova type instability , which successfully explains the observed properties of dwarf nova @xcite .",
    "an x - ray nova is also thought to be caused by such a disk instability , although its central object is expected to be a black hole @xcite .",
    "the limit - cycle behavior for active galactic nuclei has been investigated by @xcite ( see also ) .",
    "mayer and duschl ( ) investigated this instability on the pop iii disks in which they also obtained the equilibrium loci on the @xmath0 plane .",
    "however , their results based upon a one - zone approximation , even if the disk is optically thick , in which the energy transfer due to convection along the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the disk is not included . as a result ,",
    "the equilibrium loci are not s - shaped , which does not directly lead to the limit - cycle oscillations driven by thermal and secular instabilities .",
    "thus , we need a more sophisticated approach in order to understand the nature of the stability of pop iii disks . in this paper , we re - examine stability of pop iii disks , by solving the vertical structure of optically thick disks , including the effect of convection . for optically thin disks ,",
    "we adopt a one - zone approximation .",
    "in addition , we evaluate the amplification of the luminosity of accretion disks surrounding pop iii bhs by the limit - cycle oscillation . we also discuss the possibility to detect the pop iii disks by calculating their emergent spectra in the burst phase .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we describe basic equations in section 2 .",
    "we compare the stability of pop iii disks with pop i disks in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the observational possibility of pop iii black hole accretion disks , and summarise in the final section .",
    "in this subsection , we show the basic equations used to describe the vertical structure of the optically - thick accretion disks . here",
    ", we assume that the disks are in hydrostatic equilibrium along the vertical axis , and local energy balance is attained .",
    "the convective energy transport is taken into consideration .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total pressure , @xmath10 is the density , @xmath11 is the black hole mass , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the radial and vertical coordinates .",
    "the equation of energy transport is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the temperature , and @xmath16 is the adiabatic gradient .",
    "the radiative gradient , @xmath17 , is written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the opacity , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the energy flux and the radiation constant , respectively .",
    "we utilise the latest opal opacity table including low temperature opacities @xcite .",
    "the energy flux is evaluated by integrating the following equation , which represents the local energy balance : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the viscosity parameter , whereas @xmath24 represents the keplerian angular speed .",
    "we employ the expression @xmath25 $ ] ( with @xmath26 being the disk half thickness ) , which succeeds to reproduce the variation amplitude and the timescale of the x - ray novae ( , see also ) , whereas the viscosity model is still poorly understood for the primordial composition .",
    "we here note that the source of disk viscosity is though to be of magnetic origin based on the recent magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the convective gradient , @xmath27 , is calculated by the mixing - length formalism for convection @xcite , in which we assume mixing length , @xmath28 , to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pressure scale height .    in order to close the set of equations ( [ eq : fbalance])-([eq : mix ] )",
    ", we need the equation of state for the system in radiative equilibrium , @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the proton mass , @xmath33 represents the boltzmann constant , and @xmath34 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "we integrate equations ( [ hydro ] ) , ( [ temp ] ) , and ( [ flux ] ) from the disk surface ( @xmath35 ) toward the equatorial plane ( @xmath36 ) by the runge - kutta method for given parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where @xmath37 is the metallicity and @xmath38 is the mass accretion rate .",
    "the outer boundary ( @xmath35 ) conditions for temperature , energy flux , pressure are given by @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "we iteratively search @xmath26 so as to meet the condition @xmath43 at @xmath36 .",
    "then , we obtain the vertical structure of the accretion disks . in this method ,",
    "the column density and the optical thickness are calculated from @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "this method breaks down in the regions of a small mass accretion rate for pop iii disks , since then the disks become optically thin ( we will discuss this point later ) . a numerical method for optically thin disks",
    "is described in the next subsection .",
    "the optically thin disks would be nearly isothermal , in which convection does not contribute to the energy transport and the radiative diffusion approximation breaks down . here",
    ", we adopt a one - zone model for optically thin disks .",
    "since the radiation pressure is negligible in the optically thin medium , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the gas pressure .",
    "the viscous heating rate is described as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the shear stress tensor . using the alpha - prescription , @xmath50 , we rewrite the equation ( [ qvis ] ) as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the column density .",
    "the viscosity parameter , @xmath23 , is given by @xmath25 $ ] , the same as in the method for the optically thick disks .",
    "the radiative cooling rate is written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the optical thickness of the disk . combining the energy balance equation ( @xmath55 ) and equation ( [ 1dhydro ] ) , we obtain the physical quantities of the disks .",
    "to calculate the mass - accretion rate , we use the continuity equation ( @xmath56 in @xmath12-direction ) and the angular - momentum conservation low . by assuming a torque - free boundary condition and angular momentum of the gas to be much smaller at the inner boundary than at the outer region",
    ", we have @xmath57 thus , using equation ( [ qvis ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) , the mass - accretion rate is give by @xmath58    throughout the present study , we set the black hole mass to be @xmath59 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "in figure [ sji ] , we present the sequence of equilibrium curves on the @xmath0 ( mass accretion rate - surface density ) plane for @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the schwarzschild radius . here , the thick and thin solid lines indicate the resulting equilibrium loci for optically thick accretion disks with @xmath65 , in which the energy is transported via convection as well as radiative diffusion ( see  [ thick ] ) , and the optically thin isothermal disks with @xmath66 ( see  [ thin ] ) .",
    "our numerical method for optically thick disks gives optically thin branches for pop iii disks when @xmath67 .",
    "although they are unphysical branches , we represent them by the dotted lines .",
    "( 90mm,90mm)v02_fig01.ps",
    "we find that the optically - thick pop iii disks transit to the optically - thin isothermal disks at around @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , the pop i disks stay optically thick ( @xmath65 ) , even if the mass - accretion rate is less than @xmath69 .",
    "we find that all curves have two major turning points at @xmath70 ( lower - right turning point ) and @xmath71 ( upper - left turning point ) , where the gradients of the curves , @xmath72 , change their signs .",
    "in other words , the s - shaped equilibrium curves appear irrespective of the metallicity .",
    "it is known that the middle branch ( @xmath73  :   between the upper - left and lower - right turning points ) is thermally and secularly unstable , whereas the disk is stabilised in upper and lower branches , along which @xmath74 being satisfied .",
    "figure [ sji ] indicates that if the mass - accretion rate falls within the range @xmath75 , the pop iii disks exhibit the limit - cycle behaviour , as well as the pop i disks @xcite , since no stable branch exists .",
    "note that the range of the mass - accretion rate , which induces the limit - cycle behavior , increases as the radius increases .",
    "we discuss this point in  4.1 .",
    "when the disk stays in the lower stable branch , the surface density at @xmath60 increases with time , because the mass input rate ( mass supplied from outside per unit time ) is larger than the mass - output rate ( mass ejected inward per unit time ) . as a result",
    ", the disk evolves along the lower stable branch toward the lower - right turning point on the @xmath0 plane ( quiescent state ) . after a while",
    ", it suddenly jumps to the upper branch at the right end of the stable branch ( lower - right turning point ) .",
    "since the mass - input rate is smaller than the mass - output rate in the upper stable branch , @xmath76 decreases along the upper stable branch toward the upper - left turning point ( burst state ) until it jumps back to the lower branch .",
    "thus , quasi - periodic oscillation of the mass - accretion rate onto the black hole is caused by such state transitions of the disk , leading to oscillations in luminosity .    here",
    ", we stress that the s - shaped equilibrium curve of the pop iii disks , as well as the pop i disks , does not appear if we employ the one - zone approach for optically thick disks ( see figure 4 in ) .",
    "it is crucial to solve the vertical structure of the optically thick disks , including the convective effect , in order to investigate the bursting phenomenon caused by a dwarf - nova type instability .",
    "although the limit - cycle oscillations could arise both in pop i and pop iii disks , the pop iii disks exhibit stronger outbursts than do the pop i disks .",
    "the surface density at the lower - right turning point is about an order of magnitude larger in the pop iii disks than in the pop i disks , whereas the upper stable branch is independent of the metallicity .",
    "consequently , the luminosity of pop iii disks is about an order of magnitude larger than that of the pop i disks just after a state transition from the quiescent to burst states .",
    "as shown in figure [ sji ] , the equilibrium loci for @xmath61 and @xmath62 almost overlap each other .",
    "it implies that the magnitude of the outburst is independent of the metallicity as long as @xmath77 is satisfied . here",
    ", we note that the s - shaped equilibrium curves for @xmath78 deviate significantly from those for the pop iii disks , although we do not plot them in this figure .",
    "whereas the upper branch does not depend upon @xmath37 very much , the lower turning point shifts toward the left side as the metallicity increases for @xmath78 .",
    "since we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the upper branch , the timescale of the burst phase is evaluated to be @xmath81 this timescales is basically the viscous timescale .",
    "the timescale for the quiescent phase is given by @xmath82 .",
    "it is described as @xmath83 the disc evolves along the lower stable branch on this timescale , and it attains the lower - right turning point .",
    "the timescales of the burst and quiescent phases are much longer than those of the transition between the burst and quiescent states .",
    "hence , about @xmath84 of the unstable pop iii disks would stay in the burst state , which are observed as very luminous objects . here",
    ", we remark that global calculations of the disks are need for investigating the time evolution of the disks in detail .    in figure [ sji ] , we find that the mass - accretion rate exceeds the critical rate in the burst phase . in this phase",
    ", @xmath85 is comparable to , or slightly larger than , unity , although the disk is assumed to be geometrically thin in our method .",
    "the radiation pressure - dominated region would appear at the inner region of the disk , in which the disk is unstable if the viscosity is proportional to the total pressure .",
    "such coupling of two instabilities has been suggested by lin and shields ( ) . by supercritical accretion",
    ", the radiatively driven outflows would form in the vicinity of the black hole , and the photon would be trapped in the flow within the trapping radius , @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "we need a global multi - dimensional approach to investigate the disk structure in detail ( e.g. , ; ; ) .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the irradiation flux is not taken into consideration in the present study .",
    "@xcite has reported that convective disks are stabilized by strong irradiation with @xmath87 .",
    "however , it is not easy to get the irradiation flux , since it is very sensitive to the geometry and the radiative processes . in the quiescent phase",
    ", the disk is very geometrically thin , so that the irradiation flux would be reduced . in the burst phase , the thick disk forms via the supercritical accretion .",
    "then , the radiative flux is collimated in the polar direction , suppressing the irradiation effect @xcite . the self - occultation by the thick disk would also reduce the irradiation flux @xcite .",
    "for this issue , we should study the global structure of the disks , fully accounting for radiative transfer in the multi - dimensional space .    in figure [ tau ] , we represent the resulting optical thickness of the accretion disks , which are obtained by the method described in  [ thick ] , as functions of the mass - accretion rate . as shown in this figure ,",
    "the disks are very optically thick in the upper stable branch ( burst state ) , @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are though to consist of the superposition of the blackbody spectra with various temperatures at the disk surface .",
    "we show them in  [ discussion ] .",
    "( 90mm,90mm)v02_fig02.ps    in contrast , as mentioned above , the pop iii disks are optically thin in the regime of @xmath89 .",
    "such results are unphysical , since our method described in ",
    "[ thick ] is available only if the disks are optically thick .",
    "the pop i disks are optically thick , even in the case of @xmath89 .",
    "cannizzo and wheeler ( ) reported that pop i disks become optically thin for a small mass - accretion rate in the case of @xmath90 , and disks with smaller @xmath23 stay optically thick down to a far lower mass - accretion rate .",
    "since @xmath23 is around @xmath91 in the present work , our results are consistent with their study .    in the middle unstable branch , where @xmath92 @xmath93 is satisfied",
    ", the optical thickness increases very rapidly with an increase of the mass - accretion rate .",
    "hence , even in the case of pop iii disks , the optical thickness is very large in the upper stable and middle unstable branches .",
    "it is found that the spiky structure appears around @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "the feature is due to the line opacity for heavy elements .",
    "such opacity is very sensitive to the temperature as well as the density . since the matter does not contain the heavy elements for @xmath96 , and since dust cooling is dominant over line cooling for @xmath97 , the spiky structure appears only in the case of intermediate metallicity .",
    "we have so far discussed s - shaped equilibrium curves , which predict the potential possibility of limit - cycle behaviour in pop iii disks via thermal and secular instabilities .",
    "we are now ready to discuss whether the limit - cycle oscillations are activated in realistic environments surrounding pop iii disks , or not .    if we consider black holes in halos with @xmath98 at @xmath99 , the virial temperatures of these halos are typically @xmath100k , from which the gas is not evacuated by radiative feedback of the progenitor star @xcite",
    ".    the density of the gas surrounding the black holes would be comparable to , or larger than that of the virialized halos @xcite .",
    "thus , in the first place , we assess the mass - accretion rate from the host halo to the accretion disk by the bondi accretion rate with the given virialized density / temperature of the halo .",
    "( 90mm,90mm)v02_fig03.ps    in figure [ bondi ] , by using the method described in  [ thick ] , we plot the resulting sequence of equilibrium curves of disks for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 with @xmath95 ( _ the solid lines _ ) . here , the disks are optically thick , @xmath65 , on the thick solid lines . in contrast , our method described in  [ thick ] gives the optically thin solutions below the lower turning points ( see the thin solid lines ) , although this method is available only for optically thick disks .",
    "we also show the bondi accretion rates for @xmath104 ( _ the lower dotted line _ ) and @xmath105 ( _ the upper dotted line _ ) .",
    "we remark that @xmath104 is the typical gas density of halos formed at @xmath106 in standard @xmath107 cdm cosmology . here",
    ", we also assume the sound velocity of @xmath108 , which corresponds to the halo virial temperature , @xmath109k . as shown in this figure , the s - shaped curve shifts toward upper right as the radius increases .",
    "it is obvious that these accretion disks would exhibit a limit - cycle behaviour in the regions of @xmath110 , since the bondi accretion rate corresponds to the middle unstable branches at such regions .",
    "we also investigate the possibility to detect the pop iii disks . for this purpose",
    ", we try to obtain the disk seds in the burst state .",
    "since the disks are very optically thick in this state ( see figure [ tau ] ) , we calculate the seds by the superposition of the blackbody spectra with various temperatures at the disk surface . here",
    ", we consider the limit - cycle oscillation induced by disk instability at @xmath111 .",
    "we set the mass - accretion rate to be @xmath112 for @xmath113 , which is a feasible rate if we assume bondi accretion from a small dark halo .",
    "the mass - accretion rates within @xmath103 are assumed to be @xmath114 .",
    "we can estimate the temperature profile of the disk surface using above mass - accretion rates and equation ( [ teff ] ) , except for the innermost regions .",
    "this equation gives the temperature profile of @xmath115 .",
    "the mass - accretion rate exceeds the critical rate within @xmath60 ( see figure [ sji ] ) .",
    "therefore , photon trapping becomes nonnegligible in the innermost regions of the disk , @xmath116 . in this region ,",
    "the temperature profile should be modified as @xmath117 .",

    "<S> we investigate the stability of black hole accretion disks in a primordial environment ( pop iii disks for short ) , by solving the vertical structure of optically thick disks , including convective energy transport , and by employing a one - zone model for optically thin isothermal disks . because of the absence of metals in pop iii disks , we find significant differences in stability associated with ionization between pop iii disks and the disks of solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> an unstable branch in s - shaped equilibrium curves on the @xmath0 ( mass accretion rate - surface density ) plane extends to a larger surface density compared with the case of disks of solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equilibrium loci indicate that quasi - periodic oscillations in luminosity can also be driven in pop iii disks , and their maximal luminosity is typically by an order of magnitude larger than that of the disks of solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> such a strong outburst of pop iii disks can be observed by future huge telescopes , in case that the mass is supplied onto the disks at the bondi accretion rates in typical virialized small dark halos . </S>"
