    "understanding the relations between the atomic structure and the physical properties of materials remains one of the elementary questions of condensed - matter physics .",
    "one research line in this quest started with the discovery of quasicrystals by shechtman et al . in 1982.@xcite",
    "it soon became clear that quasicrystals with their 5- , 8- , 10- or 12-fold rotational symmetries , forbidden according to classical crystallography , can be described in terms of mathematical models of aperiodic tilings of a plane proposed by penrose and ammann in the 1970s.@xcite further , quasicrystals are often regarded to have a degree of order intermediate between crystals and disordered systems , which can be understood by considering the repetitiveness of local patterns .",
    "while any local pattern in crystals repeats for integer combinations of the lattice vectors , conway s theorem states that in a quasicrystal a given local pattern in a region of some diameter @xmath1 will be repeated within a distance of two diameters @xmath2.@xcite in liquids or amorphous systems the distance of identical local patterns of size @xmath1 grows exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the deterministic construction rules of the quasicrystal models can also be interpreted as some kind of order in contrast to the situation in disordered systems . on the other hand",
    ", translational symmetry is missing in contrast to crystals .",
    "various experimental investigations revealed rather exotic electrical , magnetic , and optical properties of these materials.@xcite as many quasicrystals contain a high percentage of well - conducting elements , it was originally assumed that their thermal and electrical transport properties were similar to those in crystalline or amorphous metals.@xcite however , it turned out that they rather behave like semiconducting or insulating materials because they often possess a large resistivity for small temperatures and the resistivity decreases with increasing temperature and increasing structural order of the materials.@xcite    this motivated extensive research to get a better theoretical understanding of the structure and physical properties of quasicrystals . today",
    "several exact results are known for one - dimensional quasiperiodic systems.@xcite however , the properties in two or three dimensions have been clarified to much lesser degree and are mainly based on numerical studies for limited systems with a few thousands sites due to the missing translational symmetry of quasicrystals . for instance , the electronic properties were determined numerically for the penrose tiling , the octagonal tiling , and the ammann - kramer - neri tiling.@xcite however , this makes it difficult to understand the nature of eigenstates and properties of macroscopic systems . to address this challenge ,",
    "different approaches have been followed .",
    "for example , by expanding the time - evolution operator in chebyshev polynomials the spreading of energy - filtered wave packets was studied for generalized rauzy tilings with up to @xmath3 sites.@xcite however , this approach only works for systems with a rather smooth local density of states .",
    "further , it is possible to calculate some exact eigenstates of the tight - binding hamiltonian on the penrose tiling .",
    "@xcite    we follow another approach by studying the wave - packet dynamics for @xmath0-dimensional quasicrystalline models with a separable hamiltonian in a tight - binding approach.@xcite this method is based on mathematical sequences , constructed by an inflation rule @xmath4 describing the weak and strong couplings of atoms in a quasiperiodic chain .",
    "the higher - dimensional labyrinth tilings are then constructed as a direct product of these chains and their eigenstates are directly calculated by multiplying the energies or wave functions of these chains .",
    "this allows us to study very large systems in higher dimensions with up to @xmath5 sites based on the solutions in one dimension .",
    "however , the property of separability comes at the price that the labyrinth tilings do not possess a non - crystallographic rotational symmetry . nevertheless , the labyrinth tiling is able to describe a subset of points of the octagonal quasicrystal associated to the structure of actual quasicrystals with 8-fold rotational symmetry.@xcite    in this paper we relate the hierarchical properties of these quasiperiodic systems to their electronic transport properties by numerical calculations and a renormalization group ( rg ) approach in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation of the bond strength .",
    "up to now this method has only been used to describe the quantum diffusion for the one - dimensional fibonacci chain,@xcite whereas in this paper we will also study the wave - packet dynamics for the silver - mean chain and the generalized labyrinth tilings .",
    "the upcoming sections are structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the metallic - mean chains and describe the construction of the higher - dimensional labyrinth tilings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : num - results ] we then present numerical results for wave - packet dynamics in these quasiperiodic tilings .",
    "using an rg approach and perturbation theory we derive also analytical results for the scaling behavior of the width of the wave packet in secs .  [",
    "sec : rg - theory ] to [ sec : rg - labyrinth ] , which show a good agreement with the numerical results in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation .",
    "the results are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the construction of the @xmath0-dimensional generalized labyrinth tilings is based on @xmath0 so - called metallic - mean quasiperiodic sequences , which for a parameter @xmath6 are defined by the inflation rule@xcite @xmath7 starting with the symbol @xmath8 we obtain after @xmath9 iterations the @xmath9th order approximant @xmath10 of the quasiperiodic chain .",
    "the length @xmath11 of an approximant @xmath10 is given by the recursive rule @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "further , the ratio of the lengths of two successive iterants as well as the ratio of the numbers @xmath14 of occurrence of the symbols @xmath15 and @xmath8 in an approximant approach different metallic means for @xmath16.@xcite thus , depending on the parameter @xmath6 we obtain with the continued fraction representation @xmath17 = [ b , b , b, ... ]$ ] the relations @xmath18 in this paper we only consider the cases @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thereby , the first case corresponds to the well known fibonacci sequence with the golden mean @xmath21=(1+\\sqrt{5})/2 $ ] , which is related to real quasicrystals with 5- and 10-fold symmetry,@xcite and the latter case results in the octonacci sequence with silver mean @xmath22 = 1+\\sqrt{2}$ ] , which is related to octagonal quasicrystals.@xcite    our model describes an electron hopping from one vertex of a quasiperiodic chain to a neighboring one .",
    "the aperiodicity is given by the underlying quasiperiodic sequence of couplings , where the symbols @xmath15 and @xmath8 denote the weak and strong bonds in the chain .",
    "solving the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath23 for the quasiperiodic systems with zero on - site potentials , we obtain discrete energy values @xmath24 and wave functions @xmath25 represented in the orthogonal basis states @xmath26 associated to a vertex @xmath27 .",
    "the hopping strength @xmath28 in the schrdinger equation is given by the quasiperiodic sequence @xmath10 with @xmath29 for a strong bond and @xmath30 for a weak bond ( @xmath31).@xcite applying free boundary conditions the number of vertices is @xmath32 .",
    "constructed from two golden - mean chains @xmath33 , which are perpendicular to each other .",
    "the bond strengths of the labyrinth tiling equal the product of the associated bond strengths of the one - dimensional chains as denoted for the three different bond types in the left lower corner . ]",
    "the results show that the eigenvalues are symmetric with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "thus , for even system sizes @xmath35 all energies @xmath36 have a symmetric counterpart @xmath37 , but for odd @xmath35 there is one state @xmath38 , which has no corresponding state .",
    "additionally , the eigenfunctions possess a symmetry:@xcite the eigenstate @xmath39 with the eigenvalue @xmath36 and the eigenstate @xmath40 with the respective eigenvalue @xmath37 only differ by an alternating sign depending on the vertex @xmath27 according to @xmath41 .",
    "further , for odd @xmath35 the eigenvector @xmath42 associated to the eigenvalue @xmath38 has a special structure , i.e. , @xmath42 vanishes on all even sites @xmath27.@xcite    in a next step the generalized labyrinth tilings @xmath43 in @xmath0 dimensions are constructed from the euclidian product @xmath44 of @xmath0 quasiperiodic chains @xmath10.@xcite from a geometrical point of view these chains are perpendicular to each other and the diagonals of the resulting grid correspond to the bonds of the labyrinth tiling as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : labyrinth ] . due to this product approach also",
    "the bond strengths of the labyrinth tiling equal the products of the corresponding bond strengths of the one - dimensional chains as visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : labyrinth ] .",
    "hence , in @xmath0 dimension @xmath45 different couplings occur .",
    "note that the grid decomposes into @xmath46 separate grids depending on the starting point .",
    "each of these grids corresponds to a finite @xmath9th order approximant @xmath47 of the generalized labyrinth tiling @xmath48.@xcite    the hamiltonian of the higher - dimensional generalized labyrinth tiling is separable .",
    "thus , the eigenstates of the labyrinth in @xmath0 dimensions can be constructed from the product of the eigenstates of @xmath0 one - dimensional chains:@xcite    [ equ : eigenstates ] @xmath49    the superscripts @xmath50 enumerate the eigenvalues @xmath36 and @xmath51 represent the coordinates of the vertices in the quasiperiodic tiling . due to the symmetries of the eigenstates of the one - dimensional chains mentioned above ,",
    "some of the wave functions @xmath52 and related eigenvalues @xmath53 are identical and we have to choose a subset which only includes distinct eigenstates .",
    "the construction of such a subset is described in detail elsewhere.@xcite",
    "as outlined in the introduction , the connection of the transport properties and the quasiperiodic structure of a system is not yet fully understood , and thus the investigation of transport properties of these materials continues to be of special interest . in this section , we study the wave - packet dynamics in the metallic - mean systems , in particular in the limit of weak coupling ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the results are then related to the structure of the systems by extending an rg approach in the following section .",
    "we investigate the transport properties of the quasiperiodic systems by means of the time evolution of a wave packet @xmath55 , which is constructed from the solutions @xmath56 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath57 .",
    "the time - dependent wave functions can be easily obtained via the separation approach from the solutions of the time - independent schrdinger equation in eq .   according to @xmath58 .",
    "the wave packet is then represented as a superposition of these orthonormal eigenstates @xmath59,@xcite where we assume that it is initially localized at the position @xmath60 of the quasiperiodic tiling , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "hence , with the completeness relation and normalized basis states the wave packet is defined by @xmath62    besides calculating the expansion of the wave packet in space , a more detailed analysis can be obtained by computing the mean square displacement ( also called width ) @xmath63^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] of the wave packet .",
    "the spreading of the width @xmath64 of the wave packet in an infinite system shows anomalous diffusion for @xmath65 according to @xmath66 , where the scaling exponent @xmath67 depends on the initial position @xmath60 of the wave packet.@xcite the properties of the electronic transport are governed by the wave - packet dynamics averaged over different initial positions , that is , we determine @xmath68 thereby , the scaling exponent @xmath69 is related to the conductivity @xmath70 via the generalized drude formula for zero - frequency conductivity@xcite @xmath71 the quantity @xmath72 denotes the elementary charge of an electron , @xmath73 the density of states at the fermi level @xmath74 , @xmath75 a constant , and @xmath76 a characteristic time beyond which propagation becomes diffusive due to scattering.@xcite hence , @xmath77 corresponds to the absence of diffusion , @xmath78 to classical diffusion , and @xmath79 to ballistic spreading . for quasiperiodic structures",
    "one often observes anomalous diffusion characterized by @xmath80.@xcite    within the range of anomalous diffusion , the sub - diffusive regime for @xmath81 is most interesting because in this case the conductivity @xmath70 in eq",
    ".   decreases with increasing scattering time @xmath76 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a system for which the particles are trapped due to quantum interference phenomena and conductivity is mainly caused by non - elastic collisions , where the collision rate increases with decreasing scattering time @xmath76.@xcite for @xmath82 the reverse behavior can be observed , i.e. , the conductivity decreases with increasing collision rate .",
    "we already pointed out that various experiments for real quasicrystals revealed an electronic transport in agreement to the conductivity in the subdiffusive regime ( @xmath81).@xcite     for the golden - mean ( top ) and the silver - mean ( bottom ) systems in one , two , and three dimensions for @xmath83 .",

    "[ fig : msd - octonacci ] the mean square displacement @xmath84 is also visualized for the two- and three - dimensional silver - mean labyrinth tiling , where we averaged in two dimensions over 50 and in three dimensions over 20 initial positions of the wave packet due to the limitations of computing resources .",
    "the results are qualitatively very similar to that of the quasiperiodic chains and the scaling exponents in fig .",
    "[ fig : betand ] even show that the one - dimensional scaling exponents @xmath87 are nearly identical to the results for the two- and three - dimensional labyrinth tiling .",
    "the structure and the dynamical properties of the metallic - mean systems can be described by an rg approach , which is a mathematical apparatus for the systematical study of the changes of a physical system viewed at different length scales .",
    "the general idea is that a given system can be transformed ( renormalized ) in an rg step in such a way that we obtain a new system with a reduced number of degrees of freedom ( i.e.  sites and bonds ) .",
    "we make use of the fact that the metallic - mean chains contain for @xmath88 only isolated sites ( atoms ) and biatomic clusters ( molecules ) coupled by a strong bond as visualized in fig .",

    "[ fig : rg - oct ] ) . by appropriately assigning weak and strong bonds",
    "we obtain a new silver - mean chain , which is scaled in length and energy . however , the molecular rg approach for the silver - mean chain is more complicated and requires a two - step process to yield a new silver - mean chain as shown in fig .",

    "the scaling exponent @xmath69 of the mean square displacement @xmath84 for the golden - mean and the silver - mean chain in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulations ( @xmath54 ) can be determined by an approach proposed by abe and hiramoto@xcite and further refined by pichon.@xcite it is based on the idea that the time evolution of an initially localized wave packet can be considered as the realizations of successive steps of the above described rg . in particular , this leads to the following two transformations :    _ length scaling _  in one rg step the width @xmath84 of the wave packet scales with the grid spacing @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
