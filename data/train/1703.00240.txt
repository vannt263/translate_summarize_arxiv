    "of special interest is the completeness of hoare logic over nonstandard models .",
    "the approach of using nonstandard models @xcite in investigating floyd - hoare logic was started in @xcite , and pursued , refined by many authors since then , e.g. , csirmaz @xcite , andreka et.al @xcite , hortal - gonzlez et.al @xcite , and pasztor @xcite .",
    "( for an extensive literature , see e.g. the references in @xcite . )",
    "it s noteworthy that the hungary semantics in @xcite is defined over a particular class of infinite sequences of vectors of numbers that should satisfy the induction axioms for all formulas , and floyd logic is logically complete w.r.t .",
    "this semantics .",
    "in addition , according to the floyd - hoare principle @xcite , which states that the semantics of a programming language can be formally specified by the axioms and inference rules for proving the correctness of programs written in this language , an axiomatic semantics of while - programs has been suggested by bergstra and tucker @xcite for which hoare logic is logically complete .",
    "observe that the hungary semantics and axiomatic semantics are so general that they are absent either from mathematical elegance or from practical usefulness .",
    "it would be interesting , from a new perspective , to exhibit a not only mathematically elegant but also practically useful nonstandard semantics . in what follows ,",

    "the definability theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 16 ) says that a function in @xmath0 is computable ( or equivalently @xmath0-computable @xcite ) iff it is @xmath2-definable in @xmath0 ( i.e. , the graph relation of this function is @xmath2 ) , which means that a computable function should be  simple \" .",
    "the proof of this theorem only considers a finite computation in @xmath0 , which can be encoded as a natural number in a uniform way . in nonstandard models @xmath4 of @xmath1 @xcite , a while - program",
    "@xmath3 produces a ( pseudo-@xmath4-computable ) function @xmath9 .",
    "intuitively we hope that @xmath10 is simple in @xmath4 , that is , @xmath2-definable in @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is hopeless , because for the while - program @xmath11 , @xmath10 is not @xmath2-definable , since the domain of @xmath10 is @xmath12 , the standard part of @xmath4 , which is not arithmetical by robinson s overspill lemma ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the problem consists in the interpretation of while - programs in @xmath4 , where the termination uses the finiteness in @xmath0 ( i.e. the usual finiteness ) , which is not the finiteness in @xmath4 .",
    "we shall introduce the concept of @xmath4-finiteness for the finiteness in @xmath4 and show that every @xmath4-finite sequence of vectors of numbers of @xmath4 can be coded uniformly as a number of @xmath4 .",
    "then a new interpretation of while - programs @xmath3 in all models @xmath4 of @xmath1 such that the termination of @xmath3 uses @xmath4-finiteness will be given ( the new input - output relation of @xmath3 in @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath13 in order to distinguish from the standard one @xmath14 ) .",
    "it will be shown that @xmath13 produces a simple function @xmath15 in @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a @xmath2-formula @xmath16 , dependent on @xmath3 but independent of any model of @xmath1 , that defines an ( abstract ) function @xmath17 in @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",

    "to illustrates this , the following commutative diagram is shown .",
    "+    thus , the new interpretation of while - programs extend @xmath0-computability from @xmath0 to nonstandard models of @xmath1 with the uniform @xmath2-definability . we can now define @xmath4-computability to be the computability induced by the new semantics of while - programs in @xmath4 . in subsection [ comparison_with_the_standard_semantics ] , the new semantics of while - programs",
    "is compared with the standard semantics ; and example [ example_for_two_semantics ] shows that @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 is the unique sequence of vectors of @xmath4 computable by @xmath11 with the input @xmath28 for the new semantics ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) .",
    "we shall define , based on the new semantics of while - programs , a new semantics of hoare logic in nonstandard models of @xmath1 .",
    "it will be proved that for any @xmath30 , the standard axiom system of @xmath8 is sound and complete w.r.t . the new semantics .",
    "it will be established , in @xmath1 , that the hungary semantics and axiomatic semantics coincide with the new semantics of while - programs , and that the axiom system of floyd logic is essentially the same as that of hoare logic . moreover",
    ", the reduction from @xmath8 to @xmath31 with @xmath32 follows from the new completeness theorem of @xmath8 , and the usefulness of the nonstandard semantics in hoare logic is discussed .",
    "finally , a detailed and thorough discussion of the completeness issues on hoare logic is given .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows : some preliminary results are presented in section 2 ; the concept of @xmath4-finiteness is introduced in section 3 ; the definition of the new semantics of while - programs , and comparison with the standard and hungary semantics are given in section 4 ; the soundness and completeness of @xmath8 w.r.t .",
    "the new semantics , reduction from @xmath8 to @xmath31 , and comparison with floyd logic are shown in section 5 ; the comparison with axiomatic semantics , and usefulness of nonstandard semantics in hoare logic are shown in section 6 ; remarks on the completeness issues of hoare logic are given in section 7 ; section 8 concludes the paper .",
