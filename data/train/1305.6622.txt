    "the 1.1 mm band is in many cases the longest wavelength unaffected by free - free emission , providing the least environmentally - biased view of optically thin dust emission and therefore total dust mass .",

    "it was noted in section 5 of @xcite that there was a discrepancy between our survey and previously published results .",

    "we discovered that the published v1.0bgps images have a different calibration reported in their fits headers than was used in processing the data .",
    "the calibration used in the released data was borrowed from a previous observing run , during which a different bias voltage was used , and differed from the pipeline - derived calibration by a factor @xmath17 , completely explaining the discrepancy .",
    "we checked the data for consistency with the measured calibration offset . in order to compare flux densities in identical sources , we performed aperture photometry on the v2.0data based on the locations of v1.0sources using both the ` source masks ' from bolocat v1.0@xcite and circular apertures centered on the bolocat v1.0peaks .",
    "source masks , also known as label masks , are images in which the value of a pixel is either 0 for no source or the catalog number if there is a source associated with that pixel .",

    "as expected based on section [ sec : caloffset ] , is within 10% , although the larger apertures show a slight excess with @xmath19 .",
    "this excess is expected given the improved extended flux recovery in v2.0(see section [ sec : stf ] ) .",
    "the v2.0/v1.0  flux ratio is weakly dependent on the source flux density , with higher v2.0/v1.0  ratios for brighter sources .      in section 5.5 of @xcite",
    ", we compared the bgps v1.0  data to other data sets from similar - wavelength observations .",
    "we repeat those comparisons here using the v2.0  data and demonstrate that v2.0achieves better agreement with other data sets than v1.0 .",
    "full details of the comparison were given in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath25 value allows for a local offset , i.e. a non - zero @xmath25 value indicates a substantial difference in the angular transfer function .",
    "since such an additive offset is unlikely to apply across the entire observed region , we also fit the offset for small sub - regions in the m07 and m09 data , focusing on dr21 and a region centered on g45.5 + 0.1 respectively .",
    "the results of that comparison are displayed in table [ tab : fluxcomparison ] , which includes the original comparison from @xcite .. ] bgps v2.0is in much better agreement with the other data sets than v1.0 , but it retains a significant additive offset , particularly with respect to mambo .",
    "the additive offset is explained by a difference in the angular transfer function ; the mambo observing strategy of fast position switching allows structures on the scale of the array to be preserved , while bolocam s fast - scan strategy does not .",
    "the differing observing strategy explains why there is an additive offset between bolocam and mambo , but no such offset for simba , which was used in a fast - scan mode similar to bolocam .",
    "the varying backgrounds in separate regions account for some of the remaining multiplicative offset .",
    "when individual sub - regions are compared , the additive and multiplicative offsets more clearly separate into independent components , i.e. a line with an additive offset is a better fit to the data .    to enable a comparison of flux density between the surveys ,",
    "we must account for the different spectral bandpasses of the instruments .",
    "the relative flux density measured between the instruments depends on the spectral index @xmath26 of the observed source ; @xmath27 corresponds to a perfect black body on the rayleigh - jeans tail . will be unaffected .",
    "the assumption of constant spectral index with flux is reasonable since observed spectral index - flux correlations are shallow @xcite . ] in table [ tab : relflux ] we show the relative flux densities expected for bolocam , mambo and simba ; they differ by at most 19% for spectral indices @xmath28 .",
    "bolocam flux densities are expected to be higher because bolocam has a higher effective central frequency than either of the other instruments .    in @xcite , we measured bolocam v1.0/mambo and bolocam v1.0/simba ratios in the range @xmath29 , indicating a clear disagreement between the surveys . with the v2.0   data ,",
    "we measure ratios @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these numbers still indicate that the bgps is too faint by @xmath32 relative to the expectations laid out in table [ tab : relflux ] , but with a systematic calibration error no better than 20% in each survey , this level of agreement is reasonable .",

    "the fields were selected primarily to provide even spacing in ra in order to maximize observing efficiency , and were therefore not blindly selected .    additionally , the orion a and b and mon r2 clouds were observed in observing campaigns by collaborators .",
    "these complexes are not directly part of the bgps , but are included in this data release reduced in the same manner as the galactic plane data .",
    "they are much closer than typical bgps sources and their selection for mapping is very biased , but we include them in the archival data . parts of the orion a nebula remain proprietary as of this release , but are expected to be released upon publication of kauffmann et al ( in prep ) . the california nebula has also been observed and the data published in @xcite .    finally , some archival cso data was recovered and added to the bgps .",

    "m17 is an extraordinarily bright 1.1 mm source that was poorly covered in the bgps because it is below @xmath33 .",

    "observations at wavelengths longer than 2 @xmath8and shorter than 2 cm from the ground are strongly affected by emission and absorption from our own atmosphere .",
    "optical and radio observations from the ground see through a transparent atmosphere , but millimeter observations are dominated by bright foreground emission that dominates the astrophysical signal .",
    "this foreground must be removed in order to create maps of astrophysical emission .",
    "@xcite presented a summary of the techniques used to separate astrophysical and atmospheric signals in ( sub)millimeter bolometric observations .",
    "the bolocam observations reported in this paper were conducted with a fast - scanning strategy that places some of the ` fixed ' astrophysical emission at a different sampling frequency than the varying foreground atmosphere .",
    "this approach is one of the most efficient and flexible and has been used predominantly over alternatives , such as a nodding secondary , in most recent large - scale observing campaigns @xcite .",
    "a variety of different atmospheric removal algorithms have been successfully utilized , but in addition to removing the atmospheric foreground , these approaches remove some of the astrophysical signal . in order to recover signal on angular scales up to the array size ,",
    "the most commonly used approach for bright galactic signals is an iterative reconstruction process .",
    "this process assembles a model of the astrophysical emission , subtracts it from the observed timestream , and repeats , each time reducing the amount of astrophysical signal that is removed by the algorithm .",
    "this general approach was first used on bolocam data by @xcite and refined in @xcite .",
    "we directly examine the effects of the data reduction methods below .",
    "we compared a few different methods for atmospheric subtraction and astrophysical image reconstruction , but settled on an approach very similar to that used in v1.0 .",
    "this subsection recounts the minor changes from v1.0and includes discussion of alternative approaches .    the pca method @xcite with iterative flux density restoration was used for v2.0as for v1.0 . in the pca atmosphere removal method ,",
    "the @xmath34 eigenvectors corresponding to the highest values along the diagonal of the covariance matrix ( the most correlated components ) are nulled .",
    "we nulled 13 pca components in both v1.0and v2.0 .",
    "the selection of 13 components produced the best compromise between uniform background noise and fully restored peak signal .",
    "simulations show that the point source recovery is a very weak function of number of pca components nulled ( npca ) , while extended flux recovery is a strong function of npca .",
    "however , residual atmospheric signal was substantially reduced with higher npca . in v2.0 ,",
    "20 iterations were used instead of the 50 used in v1.0 ; in both surveys , convergence was clearly achieved by 20 iterations , and generally individual iterations are indistinguishable by @xmath35 iterations .",
    "the iterative process adopts the non - negative flux density above some cutoff as a model of the astrophysical sky and subtracts that flux density from the timestream before repeating the atmospheric subtraction .",
    "this approach allows large angular scale structures to be recovered by removing them from the timestreams before they can contribute to the correlated signal .",
    "the v2.0pipeline was more succesful than in v1.0at removing negative bowls ( see section [ sec : catalogmatching ] for visual examples ) .",
    "negative bowls are introduced because the atmospheric subtraction process assumes that the mean level of any timestream , and therefore any map , is zero .",
    "the iterative process allows this assumption to be violated , creating maps with net positive signal .",
    "the reduced impact of negative bowls is attributed to a few small changes to the pipeline that each slightly mitigate the bowls .    1 .",
    "the astrophysical model is created by deconvolving the positive emission rather using positive pixels directly .",
    "the deconvolution process , which removes sub - beam - scale noise , was made more stable in v2.0by performing a local signal - to - noise cut using the noise maps described in section [ sec : noisemaps ] ; in v1.0there was no reliable noise map available during the iterative map making process .",
    "better image co - alignment reduced inter - observation spatial offsets .",
    "the astrophysical models therefore better reproduced the timestream data .",
    "improvement in the bolometer gain calibration , which is done on a per - observation basis in v2.0 , improved the convergence of the iterative map maker .",
    "these changes are individually minor , but together resulted in significant improvements to the map quality .",
    "the quadratic planar fit sky subtraction method discussed in @xcite was implemented and tested for 1.1 mm galactic plane data in the v2.0 pipeline , but was not used for the final data products . in principle , this method should do a substantially better job at removing smooth atmospheric signal from timestreams than pca cleaning because it is based on physically expected atmospheric variation .",
    "the spatial recovery was better than the aggressive 13-pca approach , but as with a simpler median subtraction approach ( subtracting the median timestream from all bolometers ) , a great deal of spurious signal from the atmosphere remained in the maps , and the noise properties were highly non - uniform , rendering source extraction difficult .",
    "it was also more computationally expensive and did not remove correlated electronic readout noise , which pca subtraction did .",
    "the @xcite approach is likely more effective at 143 ghz because the atmosphere is better - behaved at lower frequencies .",
    "we speculate that it is also more effective for deep extragalactic fields in which more repeat observations of the same field are able to distinguish atmospheric from real signal on the angular scales of the array .",
    "the bgps data are available from the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) at irsa.ipac.caltech.edu / data / bolocam_gps/. the v2.0data products include the pipeline - processed maps and bolocat label masks as in v1.0 .    in the v2.0data release , there are two new map types released : noise maps and median maps",
    ". a variant of the noise maps was produced in v1.0 , while the median maps are an entirely new data product .",
    "residual bolometer timestreams are automatically generated as part of the iterative map - making process .",
    "the residual is the result of subtracting the astrophysical model ( which is smooth , noiseless , and non - negative ) from the atmosphere - subtracted data timestream .",
    "the resulting timestream should only contain the remaining astrophysical noise .",
    "however , maps of the residual timestream contain sharp edge features because the astrophysical model is sharp - edged ( i.e. , transitions from 0 to a non - zero value from one pixel to the next ) .",
    "these sharp transitions are mitigated in the presence of noise .",
    "we therefore created noise maps by taking the local standard deviation of the residual map .",
    "pixels in the original map that were not sampled ( i.e. , represented by ` nan ` in the fits data file ) are ignored when computing this local standard deviation and their values are set to be an arbitrarily high number ( @xmath36 jy / beam ) such that pixels near the map edge are assumed to have extremely high noise ( which is reasonable , since these pixels are affected by a variety of artifacts rendering them unreliable measurements of the true astrophysical flux ) . the local noise is computed within a @xmath37-pixel gaussian , which enforces a high noise level within @xmath38 of the map edge .",
    "this method produces good noise maps ( i.e. , in agreement with the standard deviation calculated from blank regions of the signal map ) and was used both within the iterative process and for cataloging .",
    "we show the noise per pixel for each half square degree in the inner galaxy in figure [ fig : noiseperdeg ] .",
    "the noise level in each outer - galaxy field is summarized in figure [ fig : noiseperfield ] . because the outer galaxy coverage is irregular ,",
    "we show the noise per observed region rather than dividing the regions into degree - scale sub - regions .",
    "some artifacts ( cosmic ray hits , instrumental artifacts ) inevitably remained at the end of the process . in order to mitigate these effects ,",
    "`` median maps '' were created .",
    "the value of each spatial pixel was set to the median value of the timestream points intersecting that pixel ; pixels with fewer than 3 data points were set to ` nan ` .",
    "the noise in the median maps was in some cases lower than that in the weighted mean maps , particularly for fields with fewer total observations .",
    "they uniformly have mitigated instrument - related artifacts such as streaking .",
    "these maps are released in addition to the weighted - mean maps , which often have higher signal - to - noise .      in order to get the best possible pointing accuracy in each field , all observations of a given area were median - combined using the montage package , which performs image reprojections , to create a pointing master map @xcite .",
    "each individual observation was then aligned to the master using a cross - correlation technique @xcite :    1 .",
    "the master and target image were projected to the same pixel space 2 .",
    "a cross - correlation image was generated , and the peak pixel in the cross - correlation map was identified 3 .",
    "sub - pixel alignment was measured by performing a 2nd - order taylor expansion around the peak pixel    this method is similar to the version 1.0 method , but the new peak - finding method proved more robust than the previous gaussian fitting approach . the v1.0gaussian fitting approach is often used in astronomy ( e.g. , http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~mperrin/idl/sources/subreg.pro ) , but it is biased when images are dominated by extended structure",
    "this bias occurs because the least - squares fitting approach will identify the broader peak that represents auto - correlation of astrophysical structure rather than the cross - correlation between the two images . in v1.0",
    ", we attempted to mitigate this issue by subtracting off a ` background ' component before fitting the gaussian peak , but this method was not robust .",
    "the improved approach to pointing resulted in typical rms offsets between the individual frames and the master @xmath39 .",
    "the improvement in the point spread function is readily observed ( see section [ sec : catalogmatching ] ) .",
    "we carefully re - examined the pointing throughout the bgps using a degree - by - degree cross - correlation analysis between the v1.0 , v2.0 , and herschel hi - gal 350 @xmath8data .",
    "the herschel data were unsharp - masked ( high - pass filtered ) by subtracting a version of the data smoothed with a @xmath40 gaussian .",
    "the result was then convolved with a @xmath41 gaussian to match the herschel to the bolocam beam sizes .",
    "errors on the offsets were measured utilizing the fourier scaling theorem to achieve sub - pixel resolution ( inspired by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the errors on the best - fit shift were determined using errors estimated from the bgps data and treating the filtered hi - gal data as an ideal ( noiseless ) model .",
    "the tools for this process , along with a test suite demonstrating their applicability to extended structures in images , are publicly available at http://image - registration.readthedocs.org/.    the cross - correlation technique calculated the @xmath42 statistic as a function of the offset . for a reference image @xmath43 and observed image @xmath44 with error per pixel @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the pixel shifts . because y is not actually an ideal model but instead is a noisy image , we increase @xmath45 by the rms of the difference between the aligned images , using a corrected @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are the best - fit shifts .    for the majority of the examined 1-square - degree fields , the signal dominated the noise and we were able to measure the offsets to sub - pixel accuracy .",

    "we then compared the pointing offset as measured by the mean offset between the catalogs to the offset measured via cross - correlation analysis of the maps on a per - square - degree basis .",
    "the catalog and image offsets agree well , with no clear systematic offsets between the two estimators .",
    "the scatter in the catalog - based measurements is much greater , which is expected since the source positions are subject to spatial scale recovery differences between the versions and because the sources include less signal than the complete maps .",
    "there is no clear net offset between either version of the bgps and the herschel hi - gal survey , or between the two versions of the bgps .",
    "however , the scatter in the pointing offsets between v1.0and herschel is substantially greater than the v2.0-herschel offsets .",
    "the offset measured in @xcite is likely a result of particularly large offsets in a few fields with more identified sources . as shown in table [ tab : ccoffsetsmeans ] , the mean offset , _ weighted by number of sources _ , is greater for the atlasgal overlap region than overall .",
    "we reproduce a number similar to the atlasgal - measured longitude offset of @xmath53 ( our source - count - weighted @xmath58 ) , despite a much larger standard deviation and despite no significant offset being measured directly in the images .",
    "these measurements imply that the pointing offset measured by @xcite was localized to a few fields _ and _ that the offset is corrected in the v2.0data .",
    "in order to determine the angular response of the bolocam array and bgps pipeline in realistic observing conditions , we performed simulations of a plausible synthetic astrophysical sky with synthetic atmospheric signal added to the bolometer timestream .",
    "to generate the simulated atmosphere , we fit a piecewise power law to a power spectrum of a raw observed timestream ( figure [ fig : powerspecfit ] ) .",
    "the power spectrum varies in amplitude depending on weather conditions and observation length , but the shape is generally well - represented by @xmath59 `` pink '' noise ( @xmath60 ) for @xmath61 hz and flat `` white '' noise ( @xmath62 ) for @xmath63 hz , where @xmath64 is the frequency .",

    "the atmosphere timestream is then created by inverse fourier transforming this signal .",
    "gaussian noise is added to the atmospheric timestream of each bolometer independently , which renders the correlation between timestreams imperfect .",
    "this decorrelation is important for the pca cleaning , which would remove all of the atmosphere with just one nulled component if the correlation was exact .",
    "the noise level set in the individual timestreams determines the noise level in the output map .",
    "we simulated the astrophysical sky by randomly sampling signal from an azimuthally symmetric 2d power - law distribution in fourier space .",

    "the angular transfer function shows only weak dependence on the ratio of astrophysical to atmospheric power , and is approximately constant at @xmath81 recovery over the range of angular scales between the beam size and @xmath82 .",

    "our transfer function ( figure [ fig : stf ] ) cuts off at a scale @xmath88 the scuba-2 scale .",
    "while the angular extent of the bolocam footprint is only slightly smaller than scuba-2 s , some feature of the instrument or pipeline allows scuba-2 to recover larger angular scales .",
    "we speculate that the much larger number of bolometers in the scuba-2 array allows the atmosphere to be more reliably separated from astrophysical and internal electrical signals ( bias and readout noise ) , so the scuba-2 pipeline is able to run with an atmosphere subtraction algorithm less aggressive than the 13-pca approach we adopted .",
    "given an understanding of the angular transfer function , it is possible to compare the bgps to other surveys , e.g. hi - gal , atlasgal , and when it is complete , the jcmt galactic plane survey ( jps ) , for temperature and @xmath10 is the dust emissivity index , i.e. , a modification to a blackbody to create a greybody such that @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",

    "the safest approach is to `` unsharp mask '' ( high - pass - filter ) both the bgps and the other data set with a gaussian kernel with fwhm @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the filtering will limit the angular dynamic range , but will provide accurate results over the angular scales sampled .",
    "direct comparison of power spectra over the reproduced range is also possible .",
    "a demonstration of this approach is given in figure [ fig : higalpowerlaw ] , which shows the structure - rich @xmath93 field .",

    "@xcite presented the bolocat catalog of sources extracted from the v1.0data with a watershed decomposition algorithm .",
    "we have used the same algorithm to create a catalog from the v2.0catalog .",
    "we have also performed comparisons between the v1.0and v2.0data based on the extracted sources .",
    "the new catalog was derived using the same bolocat parameters as in v1.0 .",
    "this catalog includes regions that were not part of the v1.0survey area , but we restrict our comparison between v1.0and v2.0to the area covered by both surveys .",
    "one major change from the v1.0catalog is that the fluxes in the v2.0catalog are reported with background subtracted .",
    "the backgrounds are calculated from the mode of the pixels in the range @xmath99 $ ] , where r represents the aperture radius ( 20 , 40 , or 60 ) .",
    "the mode is computed using the idl astrolib routine ` skymod.pro ` , which returns the mean of the selected data if the mean @xmath100 is less than the median @xmath101 ( indicating low `` contamination '' from source flux ) or @xmath102 otherwise , then performs iterative rejection of bad pixels @xcite .",
    "we performed aperture extraction on simulated data sets to determine what size apertures are appropriate when comparing to other data sets . in figure",
    "[ fig : bgsub ] , we show the results of aperture extraction with and without background subtraction on a simulated power - law generated image with @xmath103 before and after pipeline processing .",
    "the map has had point sources added to it randomly distributed throughout the field with flux densities randomly sampled from the range @xmath104 $ ] jy , and the power - law extended flux has an amplitude @xmath105 jy .",
    "sources are extracted from the pipeline - processed map using bolocat , then the same source locations and masks are used to extract flux measurements from the input map .",
    "figure [ fig : simptsrc ] shows the input , pipeline - processed , and point - source - only maps along with the bolocat apertures to give the reader a visual reference for an @xmath103 background with point sources .",
    "the scatter between the flux density measurements derived from the input simulated sky map and the iteratively produced map is small when background subtraction is used ( the blue points ) , but large and unpredictable otherwise ( the red points ) .",
    "the agreement between the flux densities extracted from the iterative map and the input synthetic map is excellent for 40  diameter background - subtracted apertures . for these apertures ,",
    "the rms of the difference between the iterative map and the input map fluxes is @xmath106 jy when background subtraction is used , indicating the utility and necessity of this approach .",
    "the agreement is similarly good for 80apertures ( @xmath107 jy ) , but the 120apertures exhibit a source- and background - brightness dependent bias , so we recommend against apertures that large when comparing to other data sets .",
    "there are caveats to this analysis .",
    "if the `` background '' power - law map has a peak flux density @xmath108 the peak point - source flux density , the point sources will not be recovered : the cataloging algorithm will pick out peaks in the power law flux distribution .",
    "these can not be analyzed with simple aperture extraction for an @xmath103 flux density distribution .",
    "however , for shallower power - law distributions , i.e. @xmath109 , aperture extraction effectively recovered accurate flux - densities in the processed maps - shallow power - law distributions more strongly resemble point - source - filled maps .",
    "we matched the v1.0  and v2.0  catalogs based on source proximity .",
    "for each source in v1.0 , we identified the nearest neighbor from v2.0 , and found that 5741 v2.0sources are the nearest neighbor for a v1.0source out of 8004 v2.0sources in the v1.0-v2.0overlap region .",
    "similarly , we identified the nearest neighbor in v1.0for each v2.0source , finding 5745 v1.0sources are the nearest neighbor for a v2.0source out of 8358 v1.0sources .",
    "there are 5538 v1.0-v2.0source pairs for which each member of the pair has the other as its nearest - neighbor .",
    "these sources are clearly reliable and stable source identifications and constitute about 70% of the v2.0sample .",
    "most of the unmatched sources have low flux density ( figure [ fig : v1vsv2matchhist ] ) , but some were significantly higher - these generally represent sources that were split or merged going from v1.0to v2.0 .",
    "a few examples of how mismatches can happen are shown in figures [ fig : contourmatch ] and [ fig : contourmatch2 ] .",
    "the low - flux - density sources were most commonly unmatched in regions where the noise in v1.0and v2.0disagreed significantly .",
    "the high - flux - density mismatches tend to be different decompositions of bright sources and are preferentially found near very bright objects , e.g. in the galactic center region .",
    "we reproduce parts of @xcite figures 17 and 19 as our own figures [ fig : bolocathistograms ] and [ fig : sizehistograms ] .",
    "these figures show the distributions of extracted source properties ( flux density , size , and aspect ratio ) for the v1.0  and v2.0  data .",
    "the source flux density distributions above the completeness cutoff are consistent between v1.0and v2.0 , both exhibiting power - law flux density distributions @xmath110 with values in the range @xmath111 for sources with @xmath112 jy . in the left panel of figure [ fig : bolocathistograms ] , we have included the v2.0aperture - extracted data both with and without annular background subtraction .",
    "the v1.0catalog had no background subtraction performed because the backgrounds were thought to be negligible , but the v2.0catalog has had background subtraction performed so that the flux densities reported more accurately represent the sky .",
    "the v2.0data include more large sources .",
    "the longitude and latitude source flux density distribution plots , figure 15 of @xcite , are reproduced in figure [ fig : latlonhist ] .",
    "the properties are generally well - matched , although even with the 1.5@xmath113 correction factor to the v1.0  data , there is more flux density per square degree in v2.0sources .",
    "the gain in flux density recovery is both because of an increased flux density recovery on large angular scales and because of improved noise estimation , which results in a greater number of pixels being included in sources ( see section [ sec : catalogmatching ] for more details and figures [ fig : contourmatch ] and [ fig : contourmatch2 ] for examples ) .",
    "a two - dimensional histogram providing a broad overview of the survey contents is shown in figure [ fig : hist2d ] .",
    "the ratio of source counts per half square degree is included in panel 3 .",
    "this figure illustrates that the two catalog versions are broadly consistent , and the regions in which they differ significantly tend to have fewer sources",
    ". the most extreme ratios of v2.0to v1.0source counts tend to occur along field edges both because of preferentially low source counts and because the v2.0images have slightly greater extents in latitude than the v1.0 .",
    "we presented version 2 of the bolocam galactic plane survey , which is a significant improvement over v1.0 in pointing and flux calibration accuracy .",
    "the v2.0data show an improvement in large angular scale recovery .",

    "* we measured the power spectral density in some regions and compared it to that in hi - gal , concluding that the power spectra are consistent with the normally used dust emissivity values in the range @xmath118 . *",
    "a new version of the catalog has been released .",
    "the improved quality of the v2.0images has some effects on the bgps catalog but the basic statistical properties of the catalog have not significantly changed . because of changing noise properties within the images , only 70% of the individual sources in v2.0have an obvious v1.0counterpart and vice versa .",
    "the remaining 30% of sources do not have obvious counterparts because of two effects : 1 .   at low significance ,",
    "changing noise levels recover different features at marginal significance .",
    "it is likely that low significance sources in v1.0and v2.0are _ both _ real features but have been rejected in the other catalog because of the relatively conservative limits placed on catalog membership .",
    "2 .   at high significance , the catalog algorithm is dividing up complex structure using the underlying watershed algorithm . in this case , the precise boundaries between objects are sensitive to the shape of the emission .",
    "all of the high significance features appear in both catalogs , but the objects to which a piece of bright emission is assigned can vary .    despite these changes in the catalogs ,",
    "the overall statistical properties of the population show little variation except that the largest sources appear brighter and larger owing to better recovery of the large scale flux density .",
