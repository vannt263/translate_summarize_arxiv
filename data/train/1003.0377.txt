    "transport processes across the ocean have an important impact in global climate @xcite , as oceans are important reservoirs of heat and carbon dioxide which are the most important driving forces of climate change .",
    "understanding and describing transport processes on the ocean have been a challenging task over the past years , since great currents over the ocean such as gulf stream or kuroshio that seem smooth , river - like streams in their eulerian description , present a messy pattern on the float tracking @xcite .",
    "understanding such patterns is an essential ingredient for predicting the effects of global warming in earth s future climate .",
    "dynamical systems theory has provided in recent years a framework for describing transport in time dependent flows .",
    "it has been useful for finding transport routes in complex flows , which means it has successfully found order structures from erratic patterns .",
    "typical tools in dynamical systems theory are lyapunov exponents and invariant manifolds .",
    "these concepts are defined strictly on infinite time systems , however realistic flows , like those arising in geophysics or oceanography , are not infinite time systems and for their description , finite time versions of the definition of lyapunov exponents , such as , finite size lyapunov exponents fsle @xcite and finite time lyapunov exponents ftle @xcite are used .",
    "invariant manifolds are objects that in the classical theory of dynamical systems are asymptotically defined for special trajectories such as fixed points or periodic orbits with hyperbolic stability .",
    "recent articles by @xcite have provided definitions that generalise these reference orbits for time dependent aperiodic flows .",
    "these special trajectories are called distinguished trajectories . the definition given in @xcite",
    "is proven to encompass fixed points and periodic orbits as particular cases .",
    "separation points ( sp ) on boundaries such as , detachment and reattachment points are also particular examples of distinguished hyperbolic trajectories ( dht ) .",
    "the computation of sp has been also addressed in @xcite however the definition provided in @xcite provides a systematic way for finding these special trajectories not only on boundaries but also in the interior of the flow .",
    "dht and their stable and unstable manifolds are the essential dynamical tools we will apply in this article for describing transport in geophysical flows .",
    "lagrangian and eulerian observational datasets have held great promise of providing deep insight on oceanic transport .",
    "drifters observations have revealed fluid exchange @xcite in the gulf stream .",
    "an important step forwards in the description of exchange of trajectories across the gulf stream was the meandering kinematic model proposed by @xcite .",
    "studies such as @xcite have succeeded in describing transport in simplified models of the gulf stream by means of lobe dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , ocean - observing satellites are entering a new operational era and naturally occupy an important place in programs designed to manage and predict ocean and climate change .",
    "these instruments may provide a near real time processing system of satellite altimeter data . in this article",
    "we describe cross - frontal transport along a major ocean current , the kuroshio current , based on a lagrangian description of observed altimeter velocities , over a period of the year 2003 .",
    "our description uses dynamical objects such as the stable and unstable manifolds of distinguished trajectories .",
    "we detect the turnstile mechanism across a part of the kuroshio current .",
    "the turnstile survives persistently from april 3 to may 26 , 2003 .",
    "this mechanism had already been found to be present in realistic numerically produced data sets modeling the north balearic front @xcite . in this article",
    "we discuss similar ideas with the challenge of dealing with altimeter data .",
    "lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) , as the use of finite time lyapunov exponents to compute transport issues in geophysical flows is referred to , or fsle have also recently applied to describe dynamics in altimeter datasets @xcite , although these studies are focused in areas of the ocean surface different from the kuroshio current .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the analysed data and to what extent the velocity field satisfies the divergence free approach .",
    "section 3 describes the details of the interpolation used in the data and provides the equations of the continuous dynamical system used on our analysis .",
    "section 4 describes the computation of the distinguished hyperbolic trajectories and of their stable and unstable manifolds for the system built up in section 3 .",
    "section 5 describes the turnstile mechanism governing the dynamics across a current that persist on the data amid latitudes @xmath0n and @xmath1n and longitudes @xmath2e and @xmath3e during the months of april to may 2003 .",
    "finally section 6 details the conclusions .",
    "in this work we analyze transport across the kuroshio current from april 3 to may 26 , 2003 , spanning a time interval of 54 days .",
    "we use daily maps of surface currents computed at cls in the framework of the surcouf project @xcite from a combination of altimetric sea surface heights and windstress data  in a two - steps procedure : on one hand , multimission ( ers - envisat , topex - jason ) altimetric maps of sea level anomaly ( sla ) are added to the rio05 global mean dynamic topography @xcite to obtain global maps of sea surface heights from which surface geostrophic velocities ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) are obtained by simple derivation . @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the coriolis parameter and g the gravitational constant .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ekman component of the ocean surface current ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) is estimated using a 2-parameter model : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are estimated by latitudinal bands from a least square fit between ecmwf 6-hourly windstress analysis @xmath13 and an estimate of the ekman current obtained removing the altimetric geostrophic current from the total current measured by drifting buoy velocities available from 1993 to 2005 ( the method is described in further details in @xcite ) .    both the geostrophic and the ekman component of the ocean surface current are added to obtain estimates of the ocean total surface current that are used in the kuroshio area for the present study .",
    "[ velocityfield ] shows a sample of the velocity field on april 4 , 2003 .",
    "we have marked with a line the current across which we study transport .",
    "the presence in the nearby of two counterclockwise eddies suggest the presence of two hyperbolic points at both sides of the line that could maintain the turnstile mechanism .",
    "we will show in section 5 that this is truly case .",
    "the interaction of these type of eddies with the main current has been pointed out to trigger the kuroshio meander formation @xcite .",
    "our work considers that in the area under study the particle motion is restricted to the ocean surface , i.e , there is no significative vertical motions .",
    "the altimeter - derived velocity field is two - dimensional , however since the ekman correction has been introduced , it is not guaranteed that the data is divergence free .",
    "we have computed the divergence of the velocity field in the whole period and area under study and we have verified that despite these corrections the divergence free approach is still valid .",
    "the equations of motion that describe the horizontal evolution of particle trajectories on a sphere is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the eastward and northward components of the altimetry surface velocity field respectively described in the previous section .",
    "particle trajectories must be integrated in equations ( [ eqm1])-([eqm2 ] ) and since information is provided just in a discrete space - time grid , a first issue to deal with is that of interpolation of discrete data sets .",
    "a recent paper by @xcite compares different interpolation techniques in tracking particle trajectories .",
    "bicubic spatial interpolation in space @xcite and third order lagrange polynomials in time are shown to provide a computationally efficient and accurate method .",
    "we use this technique in our computations .",
    "however we notice that bicubic spatial interpolation in space as discussed in @xcite requires an equally spaced grid .",
    "our data input is expressed in spherical coordinates , and the grid is not uniformly spaced in the latitude coordinate . in order to interpolate in an uniformly spaced grid , we transform our coordinate system ( @xmath17 ) to a new one ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the latitude @xmath19 is related to the new coordinate @xmath20 by @xmath21 our velocity field is now on a uniform grid in the ( @xmath18 ) coordinates .",
    "the equations of motion in the old variables are transformed to a new expression in the new variables , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is obtained by inverting eq .",
    "( [ mul ] ) , i.e. @xmath24 once trajectories are integrated from these equations , for presentation purposes one can convert @xmath20 values back to latitudes @xmath19 just by using ( [ lmu ] ) .",

    "the current , similarly to that studied in @xcite , flows eastward .",
    "first we identify a dht in the western part of the flow , for which we compute the unstable manifold and a dht in the eastern part , for which we compute the stable manifold .",
    "computation of distinguished hyperbolic trajectories for aperiodic flows has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the approach taken in this article is that of @xcite , which is based on the function @xmath25 defined as follows .",

    "we have used the romberges method ( see @xcite ) of order @xmath42 with @xmath43 .    the function @xmath25 is defined over an open set , so it does not necessarily attain a minimum , but if it does , the minimum is denoted by @xmath44 . in @xcite",

    "<S> in this article we explore the ability of dynamical systems tools to describe transport in oceanic flows characterized by data sets measured from satellite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we have studied the geometrical skeleton describing transport in the kuroshio region . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we have computed special hyperbolic trajectories , recognized as distinguished hyperbolic trajectories , that act as organizing centres of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed their stable and unstable manifolds , and they reveal that the turnstile mechanism is at work during several spring months in the year 2003 across the kuroshio current . we have found that near the hyperbolic trajectories takes place a filamentous transport front - cross the current that mixes waters at both sides . </S>"
