    "during the past several years , significant progresses have been made in the observation of the heavy - light mesons . in 2003 , two new narrow charm - strange mesons @xmath28 and @xmath29 were observed by babar , cleo and belle @xcite .",
    "recently , babar reported another two new charm - strange mesons , i.e. @xmath20 with a width of @xmath30 mev and @xmath24 with a width of @xmath31 mev in the @xmath32 decay channel  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , belle reported a new vector state @xmath33 with a width of @xmath34 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath33 are believed to be the same state since their masses and widths are consistent with each other . in the @xmath35 meson sector",
    "two narrow states @xmath16 and @xmath36 were reported by cdf @xcite , and are assigned as orbitally excited @xmath35 mesons .",
    "they were confirmed by d0 collaboration with slightly different masses @xcite .",
    "cdf collaboration also reported their strange analogues , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as orbitally excited @xmath39 mesons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 is also observed by d0 collaboration @xcite . about the recent experimental status of the heavy - light mesons ,",
    "many reviews can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to understand the nature of the heavy - light mesons , especially the newly observed states , and to establish the heavy - light meson spectroscopy ,",
    "a lot of efforts have been made on both experiment and theory .",
    "for example , one can find recent discussions about the dynamics and decay properties of the heavy - light mesons given by close and swanson @xcite , godfrey @xcite , and other previous analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the new observed heavy - light mesons , such as @xmath20 and @xmath24 , various attempts on the explanation of their nature",
    "have been made @xcite .",
    "many systematic studies are devoted to establish the @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath35 , and @xmath39 spectroscopies  @xcite , while some earlier works can be found in refs .",
    "recent reviews of the status of the theory study of the heavy - light mesons can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite    on the one hand , the improved experimental measurements help clarify some old questions on the spectrum . on the other hand",
    ", they also raise some new ones which need further experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath18 reported by delphi in @xmath40  @xcite as the first radial excited state still has not yet been confirmed by any other experiments .",
    "the spin - parity of the narrow @xmath8 also need confirmations .",
    "the status of the broad @xmath4 is not clear at all , its measured mass and width have too large uncertainties . for the @xmath25 spectroscopy ,",
    "the low masses of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 still can not be well explained by theory ; whether they are exotic states is an open question .",
    "theoretical predictions for the @xmath20 and @xmath24 are far from convergence .",
    "the narrow state @xmath23 seen by selex collaboration  @xcite can not be naturally explained by any existed theory .",
    "nevertheless , since the flavor symmetry of the heavy - light mesons is badly broken , mixture of states with the same @xmath41 may occur .",
    "this will add further complexities into the meson spectrum and further theoretical investigations are needed .    in this work , we make a systematic study of the strong decays of heavy - light mesons in a chiral quark model . in the heavy - quark infinite mass limit ,",
    "the flavor symmetry does no longer exist in the heavy - light mesons , which allows us to describe the initial and final @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath35 , and @xmath39 mesons in a nonrelativistic framework self - consistently",
    ". the meson decay will proceed through a single - quark transition by the emission of a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "an effective chiral lagrangian is then introduced to account for the quark - meson coupling . since the quark - meson coupling is invariant under the chiral transformation ,",
    "some of the low - energy properties of qcd are retained .",
    "this approach is similar to that used in refs .",
    "@xcite , except that the two constants in the decay amplitudes of refs .",
    "@xcite are replaced by two energy - dependent factors deduced from the chiral lagrangian in our model .    the chiral quark model approach has been well developed and widely applied to meson photoproduction reactions  @xcite .",
    "its recent extension to describe the process of @xmath42 scattering and investigate the strong decays of charmed baryons also turns out to be successful and inspiring  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the subsequent section ,",
    "the heavy - light meson in the quark model is outlined .",
    "then , the non - relativistic quark - meson couplings are given in sec.[qmc ] .",
    "the decay amplitudes are deduced in sec .",
    "we present our calculations and discussions in sec .",
    "[ cd ] . finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "for a heavy - light @xmath43 system consisting light quark 1 and heavy quark 2 with masses @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , its eigen - states are conventionally generated by a harmonic oscillator potential @xmath46 where vectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the coordinate and momentum for the @xmath49-th quark in the meson rest frame , and @xmath50 describes the oscillator potential strength which is independent of the flavor quantum number .",

    "the clebsch - gordan series for the spin and angular - momentum addition @xmath68 has been omitted , where @xmath69 is the flavor wave function . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      due to isospin violation , @xmath70 is about 3 mev heavier than the neutral @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "this small difference leads to a kinematic forbiddance of @xmath72 , while @xmath73 and @xmath74 are allowed , but with a strong kinematic suppression .",
    "nevertheless , it shows by tab .",
    "[ asa ] that the decay amplitudes of @xmath75 states are proportional to the final state momentum @xmath76 . for the decays of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath74 of which",
    "the decay thresholds are close to the @xmath79 masses , it leads to further dynamic suppressions to the partial decay widths .",
    "as shown in tab . [ width ] , our calculations are in remarkable agreement with the experimental data . since @xmath76 is small , the form factor corrections from quark model are negligibly small .",
    "one would expect that the ratio @xmath80 is then dominated by the isospin factor @xmath81 , which agrees well with the prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the @xmath82 coupling scheme , there are four 1@xmath3 states : @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "its transition to @xmath86 is forbidden .",
    "states of @xmath84 , and @xmath87 can couple into @xmath86 , but not @xmath88 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath89 can be coupled to both @xmath86 and @xmath90 . in the decay amplitudes of @xmath85 , @xmath84 , and @xmath87 ,",
    "the term @xmath91 dominates the partial decay widths , and usually their decay widths are much broader than that of @xmath89 . between the amplitudes of the @xmath92 and @xmath87",
    "decays , we approximately have : @xmath93 since the term @xmath94 is negligible when the decay channel threshold is close to the initial meson mass . as a consequence ,",
    "the decay widths of the @xmath92 states are narrower than those of @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath4 is listed in pdg  @xcite as a broad @xmath85 state .",
    "its mass values from belle  @xcite and focus collaboration  @xcite are quite different though the focus result is consistent with the potential quark model prediction of 2403 mev  @xcite . in experiment , only the @xmath95 channel are observed since the other channels are forbidden .",
    "the term @xmath96 in the amplitude , which is in proportion to the oscillator parameter @xmath97 , accounts for the broad decay width . by applying",
    "the pdg averaged mass 2352 mev and the focus value 2403 mev , its partial decay widths into @xmath95 are calculated and presented in tab .",
    "[ width ] .",

    "the predicted mass for @xmath98 and @xmath99 mesons are about 5730 mev and 5800 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "their strong decays only open to @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "applying the theory - predicted masses , we obtain broad decay widths for both states , i.e. @xmath102 mev , and @xmath103 mev , respectively .",
    "our prediction of @xmath102 mev is compatible with the qcdsr prediction @xmath104 mev @xcite .",

    "the decay width of @xmath105 is @xmath106 mev and that of @xmath107 is @xmath108 mev .",
    "since there is no obvious dynamic reason for such a significant difference , it may simply be due to experimental uncertainties .",
    "our prediction @xmath109 mev as a sum of the partial widths of @xmath95 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , is comparable with the data . nevertheless , the partial width ratio @xmath112 obtained here is also in good agreement with the data @xmath113  @xcite .",

    "our predictions for the total width and ratio @xmath116 are @xmath117 which are consistent with the data .",
    "notice that the width of @xmath15 , @xmath118 mev , is one - order - of - magnitude smaller than that of @xmath32 .",
    "apart from the kinematic phase space suppression , its transition amplitude also suffers dynamic suppressions since it is proportional to @xmath119 .",

    "similarly large discrepancies are also found if one simply exchanges the assignments .",

    "<S> we carry out a systematic study of the heavy - light meson strong decays in a chiral quark model . for the @xmath0-wave vectors ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , @xmath3-wave scalars ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and tensors ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain results in good agreement with the experimental data . for the axial vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 , a state mixing scheme between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is favored with a mixing angle @xmath12 , which is consistent with previous theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the same mixing scheme also applies to @xmath13 and @xmath14 that accounts for the narrow width of the @xmath14 and its dominant decay into @xmath15 . for @xmath16 and @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> , such a mixing explains well the decay width of the former but leads to an even broader @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for the strange - bottom axial vectors are also made . </S>",
    "<S> for the undetermined meson @xmath18 , we find that they fit in well the radially excited state @xmath19 according to its decay mode . </S>",
    "<S> the newly observed @xmath20 strongly favors the @xmath21-wave excited state @xmath22 . for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we find they are difficult to fit in any @xmath25 excitations in that mass region , if the experimental data are accurate . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions for decay modes of those unobserved states as multiplets of @xmath26 and @xmath27 waves are also presented , which should be useful for further experimental search for those states . </S>"
