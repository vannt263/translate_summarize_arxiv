    "spin effect is a powerful tool to study the properties of the hadronic interactions and hadron structures .",
    "since the deep understanding of different aspects in spin physics of strong interaction almost always involves hadron production , spin effects in high energy fragmentation processes have attracted much attention recently , both experimentally and theoretically ( see e.g.refs.[1-14 ] and the references given there ) .",
    "there are two main aspects in this connection , i.e. , the dependence of the polarization and the momentum distribution of the produced hadron on the spin of the fragmenting quark .",
    "the former is usually referred as the spin transfer in the fragmentation process . for the latter , if the fragmenting quark is transversely polarized , we study the azimuthal angle dependence of the produced hadrons , and if the fragmenting quark is longitudinally polarized , we study a quantity which is called `` jet handedness '' .",
    "the first two problems are closely related to the studies of the hyperon polarization in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions and the left - right asymmetries in singly polarized hadron - hadron collisions@xcite .",
    "i will concentrate on these two problems in my talk .",
    "spin transfer in high energy fragmentation process is defined as the probability for the polarization of the fragmenting quark to be transferred to the produced hadron . here ,",
    "we consider @xmath2 .",
    "we suppose that the @xmath3 was polarized before the fragmentation , and ask the following questions : ( 1 ) will the @xmath3 keep its polarization ? ( 2 ) how is the relation between the polarization of @xmath3 and that of the produced @xmath4 which contains the @xmath3 ? clearly , the answers to these questions depend on the hadronization mechanism and on the spin structure of hadrons",
    ". the study can provide useful information for both aspects .",
    "in particular , there exist now two distinctively different pictures for the spin contents of the baryons : the static quark model using the su(6 ) symmetric wave function [ referred as the su(6 ) picture ] , and the picture drawn from the data for polarized deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) and su(3 ) flavor symmetry in hyperon decay [ referred as the dis picture ] .",
    "it is natural to ask which picture is suitable to describe the question ( 2 ) mentioned above .",
    "obviously , the answers to these questions are also essential in the description of the puzzling hyperon transverse polarization observed already in the 1970s in unpolarized hadron - hadron reactions .",
    "it has been pointed out that@xcite measurements of the longitudinal @xmath0 polarization in @xmath1 annihilations at the @xmath5 pole provide a very special check to the validity of the su(6 ) picture in connecting the spin of the constituent to the polarization of the hadron produced in the fragmentation processes .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 polarization in this reaction obtained from the su(6 ) picture should be the maximum among different models .",
    "data are now available@xcite from both aleph and opal collaborations .",
    "the results show that the su(6 ) picture seems to agree better with the data@xcite compared with the dis picture .",
    "( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this is rather surprising : the energy at lep is very high hence the initial quarks and anti - quarks produced at the @xmath1 annihilation vertices are certainly current quarks and current anti - quarks",
    ". they can not be the constituent quarks used in describing the static properties of hadrons using su(6 ) symmetric wave functions .",
    "it is thus interesting and instructive to have further checks by making complementary measurements .",
    "we note that , to study the spin transfer in fragmentation , we need to know the polarization of @xmath3 and measure the polarization of the produced @xmath4 . hence , hyperon productions in lepton - induced reactions are ideal to study this problem . here",
    ", the polarization of quark can easily be calculated using the standard model for electroweak interaction and the hyperon polarization can easily be determined by measuring the angular distribution of its decay products .",
    "we have thus made a systematic study@xcite@xmath6@xcite of hyperon polarizations in different lepton - induced reactions .",
    "the obtained results can be used as further checks of the different pictures .",
    "now we give a brief summary of the calculation method and the obtained results .",
    "the calculation method has been formulated in different literature . here , we summarize the main points in order to show the different inputs we need and what kinds of uncertaintities we may have in the calculations .",
    "we consider @xmath7 and divide the produced @xmath8 s into the following groups : ( a ) directly produced and contain the @xmath9 s ; ( b ) decay products of heavier hyperons which were polarized before their decays ; ( c ) directly produced but do not contain the @xmath9 ; ( d ) decay products of heavier hyperons which were unpolarized before their decays .",
    "obviously , hyperons from ( a ) and ( b ) can be polarized while those from ( c ) and ( d ) are not .",
    "we obtain , @xmath10 the different quantities here are defined and obtained in the following way :    \\(i ) @xmath11 is the polarization of @xmath9 which is determined by the electroweak vertex .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath12 is the average number of @xmath8 s which are directly produced and contain @xmath9 of flavor @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is that from the decay of @xmath15 s which were polarized ; @xmath16 is the polarization of @xmath15 ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are average numbers of @xmath8 s in group ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "these average numbers of the hyperons of different origins are determined by the hadronization mechanisms and should be independent of the polarization of the initial quarks . hence , we can calculate them using a hadronization model which give a good description of the unpolarized data .",
    "we used lund model implemented by jetset or lepto in our calculations .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath21 is the probability for the polarization of @xmath9 to be transferred to @xmath8 in group ( a ) and is called the polarization transfer factor , where the superscript @xmath22 stands for fragmentation .",
    "it equals to the fraction of spin carried by the @xmath13-flavor - quark divided by the average number of quark of flavor @xmath13 in @xmath8 , which is different in the su(6 ) or the dis picture@xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath23 is the probability for the polarization of @xmath15 to be transferred to @xmath8 in the decay process @xmath24 and is called decay polarization transfer factor , where the superscript @xmath25 stands for decay",
    ". it is determined by the decay process and is independent of the process in which @xmath15 is produced . for the octet hyperon decays ,",
    "they are extracted from the materials in review of particle properties .",
    "but for the decuplet hyperons , we have to use an estimation based on the static quark model .",
    "this is a major source of the theoretical uncertainties in our calculations of the final @xmath26 s in different reactions .",
    "we applied@xcite@xmath6@xcite the method to @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 at high energies and calculated the polarization of different octet hyperons in these reactions .",
    "we now summarize the main results as follows .      for @xmath27",
    ", we made the calculations at lep i and lep ii energies .",
    "the results show that , all the octet hyperons should be significantly polarized and the polarizations are different in the su(6 ) or the dis picture .",
    "we also tried to make flavor separation .",
    "we found that it is impossible to separate only contribution from @xmath30 or @xmath31 to @xmath0 .",
    "but we can enhance the contribution from @xmath32 fragmentation by giving some criteria to the selected events . for details ,",
    "see ref.[6 ] .      in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scatterings , at sufficiently high",
    "@xmath33 and hadronic energy @xmath34 , hadrons in the current fragmentation region can be considered as the pure results of the fragmentation of the struck quarks .",
    "there are two advantages to study hyperon polarization in @xmath35 : here , flavor separation can be achieved by selecting events in certain kinematic regions ; and we can study the spin transfer both in longitudinally and in transversely polarized cases .",
    "we made the calculations for different combinations of beam and target polarizations .",
    "the results show the following characteristics :    \\(a ) hyperons are polarized quite significantly if the beam is polarized but @xmath0 polarization is quite small in the case of unpolarized beam and polarized target .",
    "\\(b ) there is significant contribution from heavier hyperon decay to @xmath0 , it is even higher than the directly produced in most kinematic regions .",
    "\\(c ) for @xmath36 , the decay contribution is very small and the polarization is higher than that for @xmath0 and the differences from the different pictures are also larger .",
    "\\(d ) the transverse polarization of the outgoing struck quark is obtained only in the case of using transversely polarized target .",
    "but the resulted @xmath0 transverse polarization is very small and the decay influence is large .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath36 polarization is larger and there is almost no decay contribution .",
    "we made similar calculations for @xmath29 .",
    "we found that there is a complete flavor separation for @xmath36 production .",
    "it comes almost completely from @xmath30 quark fragmentation .",
    "this leads to a quite high @xmath36 polarization .",
    "( see fig.2 . ) however , for @xmath0 production , contribution from charmed baryon decay is very significant .",
    "it can completely destroy even the qualitative feature of the @xmath0 polarization .",
    "we thus reached the conclusion that , in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering , @xmath36 production is much more suitable to study the spin transfer in fragmentation processes . for details , see ref.[7 ] .",
    "we note that there are also measurements@xcite on @xmath0 polarization in @xmath38 by nomad collaboration at cern .",
    "compared the nomad data ( see fig.3 ) with the above - mentioned theoretical results , we see a distinct difference : while the theoretical results go to zero when @xmath39 goes to zero , the data show that @xmath40 rises monotonically when @xmath39 decreases from positive @xmath39 to negative @xmath39 .",
    "it does not go to zero when @xmath39 goes to zero .",
    "does this imply that none of the pictures discussed above is suitable for @xmath38 ?",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that the answer to the question should be `` no ! '' this is because , in the above mentioned calculations , we took only the struck quark fragmentation into account and neglected the influence from the remnant of the scattered nucleon .",
    "this is a good approximation only at high energies , or more precisely , at high @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "but , in the nomad experiments , the incident energies of the @xmath41 is @xmath42 gev and @xmath34 is only of several gev . in this case , no separation between the fragmentation products of the struck quark and those of the nucleon remnant is possible . in particular , in the region of @xmath39 around zero , the contributions from the nucleon remnant can be very important .",
    "we studied this problem numerically using the event generator lepto .",
    "the results show that the contributions from the nucleon remnant indeed play an important role even at @xmath43 .",
    "we have to take it into account in such energy regions .    using a valence quark model to calculate the polarization of the nucleon remnant",
    ", we made a very rough estimation of @xmath44 in @xmath38 at the nomad energies by taking both the fragmentation of the struck quark and that of the nucleon remnant into account .",
    "a qualitative agreement with the data@xcite is obtained ( see fig.3 or ref.[7 ] for details ) .",
    "last but not least , we emphasize that the spin effects in fragmentation processes can also be studied in polarized @xmath46 collisions ( e.g. at rhic ) by measuring the hadrons in high @xmath45 jets . here , it is envisaged that these hadrons are pure products of the fragmentation of the scattered quak ( antiquark or gluon ) .",
    "since we have many different hard subprocesses ( e.g. @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 ) which contribute to high @xmath45 jets , the situation here is much more complicated than that in the lepton induced reactions discussed above .",
    "we have in particular the contribution from gluon fragmentation .",
    "this , on the one hand , make the study more difficult since we know much less about gluon polarization and fragmentation . on the other",
    ", it makes the study also more interesting since we can use it to study not only quark but also gluon fragmentation .",
    "a simple monte - carlo study@xcite shows that , for moderately high @xmath45 ( e.g. @xmath50 gev ) , gluon fragmentation dominates .",
    "this is a kinematic region which is suitable for studying gluon fragmentation .",
    "but , for very high @xmath45 and large @xmath51 , quark fragmentation dominates . here",
    ", we can apply the above - mentioned the method to calculate the longitudinal hyperon polarizations .",
    "such calculations have also been carried out@xcite .",
    "an example of the obtained results is given in fig.4 .",
    "another aspect which is related to the problem of spin transfer in fragmentation is the spin alignment of vector meson in high energy reactions .",
    "it is clear that the polarization of the fragmenting quark can also be transferred to the vector meson @xmath52 .",
    "this effect can be studied by measuring @xmath53 , the @xmath54 component of the helicity density matrix of @xmath52 , which is just the probability for @xmath52 to be in the helicity zero state .",
    "data are available@xcite for @xmath1 annihilation at the @xmath5-pole at lep .",
    "it shows that , for vector mesons with high momentum fraction , @xmath53 is much larger than @xmath55 , the result expected in the unpolarized case .",
    "a simple calculation shows that@xcite these data@xcite imply a significant polarization of the @xmath56 that is created in the fragmentation and combines with the polarized @xmath9 to form the vector meson .",
    "the polarization has a simple relation to that of the @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a constant . using this we got a good fit to the data@xcite",
    ". it should be interesting to see whether this relation is also true in other processes where polarized @xmath9 is produced .",
    "we thus apply it to other reactions and made predictions for the spin alignments of vector mesons in these processes .",
    "they can be checked by future experiments . for details , see ref.[8 ] .",
    "in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark , the products can have an azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "the first measurement in this connection has been carried out by hermes@xcite , and the results show that such an effect indeed exists at that energy .",
    "what we would like to point out here is the following : the existence of such an azimuthal asymmetry is a direct consequence of lund string fragmentation model due to conservation of energy - momentum and angular momentum .",
    "the model was first used@xcite to spin effects in 1979 to explain the unexpected @xmath0 polarization in unpolarzed pp collisions . by applying@xcite it to the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark",
    ", we obtain a significant azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "we are now working on the numerical calculations along this line in collaboration with the lund group .",
    "predictions for semi - inclusive deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering and hadrons in high @xmath45 jets in transversely polarized @xmath46 collisions will be available soon .",
    "it is a great pleasure for me to thank the organizer for inviting me to give the talk .",
