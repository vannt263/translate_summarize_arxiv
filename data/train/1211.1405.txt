    "pleiotropy occurs when a single genetic factor influences multiple continuous or binary phenotypes , and it is present in many genetic studies of complex human traits such as diabetes , hypertension and cardiovascular diseases . in genetic studies of complications or secondary manifestations of a disease , it is often believed that there are common genetic risk factors for the different phenotypes . in other cases , the primary and often conceptual phenotype ( e.g. disease severity )",
    "may not be directly measured or be characterized by one single phenotype , and a set of surrogate response variables must instead be used .",
    "these response variables ( phenotypes or outcomes ) are mutually correlated as they measure the underlying trait from different perspectives . in order to take into account all information and to increase statistical efficiency ,",
    "it is desirable to model these outcomes jointly .",
    "an added characteristic of many emerging large - scale genetic studies is the collection of repeated measures over time in correlated individuals ( family data ) .",
    "for example , the ongoing t2d - genes ( type 2 diabetes genetic exploration by next - generation sequencing in multi - ethnic samples ) consortium study includes longitudinal measures of various t2d - revelant phenotypes ( e.g.  blood glucose levels and blood pressures ) and other covariates ( e.g.  sex , body mass index and medication history ) , and these measures are collected for 2,500 individuals from 85 mexican - american families .",
    "similarly , the dcct ( diabetes control and complications trial ) study includes longitudinal measures of various type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) complications , which we analyze in this paper .",
    "the longitudinal family studies combine the features of longitudinal studies in independent individuals and studies using single - time - point phenotype measures in families , providing more information about the genetic and environmental factors associated with the traits of interest than cross - sectional studies @xcite .",
    "however , joint modeling of multiple phenotypes using longitudinal family data involves non - trivial statistical and computational challenges because of the complex correlations that exist between different phenotypes ( the phenotypical correlation ) , between repeated measures from the same phenotype ( the serial correlation ) and between individuals within the same family ( the familial correlation ) .",
    "robust and powerful methods for the study of pleiotropy are under - developed in the literature due to data complexities that include a ) the phenotypes of interest can be continuous , discrete or both , b ) the joint effect of covariates on the multiple phenotypes is difficult to specify , and c ) the familial , serial and other correlations are often present in the data as discussed above .",
    "there are a number of approaches proposed for cross - sectional data .",
    "for instance , @xcite extended the standard linear combination test to incorporate data - driven weighting factors , @xcite applied the principal component analysis to the multiple traits of interest to obtain independent canonical variables and then conducted univariate quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) analyses , and @xcite developed a qtl - mapping method based on generalized estimating equations . here",
    "we propose to use the latent variable ( lv ) methodology to jointly study multiple correlated phenotypes in the presence of serial and familial correlations .",
    "the formulation of a latent variable model ( lvm ) relies on postulating the effect of a random variable that is not observed by the researchers but is assumed to exert an important influence on the set of observed variables ( also known as the manifest variables ) and thus induces correlations among them @xcite . in the context of pleiotropy studies ,",
    "the manifest variables are the multiple observed phenotypes , which jointly inform the latent variable that represents the underlying conceptual disease status or severity .",
    "the lv methodology has been widely used in many scientific fields including economics , psychology and social sciences , and it is becoming increasingly attractive for genetic studies .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed a lv approach for the analysis of multivariate quantitative trait loci , @xcite applied a factor analysis ( a sub - type of lvm ) to find latent common genetic components of obesity traits , and @xcite used the factor analysis for a metabolic syndrome study .",
    "initial applications of lvm focused on reducing the number of manifest variables to a smaller number of latent outcomes . @xcite and @xcite extended the lvm to allow covariates to have effects on both the manifest and latent variables . @xcite discussed a lv approach for longitudinal data with continuous outcomes .",
    "the proposed lvm consists of two parts .",
    "the first part models the relationship between the manifest variables and the lv to characterize the within - subject correlation among the different outcomes . the second part uses a linear mixed effect model to investigate the effect of a genetic marker and other covariates on the lv , accounting for the serial and familial correlations .",
    "direct effects of covariates on the manifest variables are also allowed in the first part of model .",
    "the paper makes a number of original contributions .",
    "the proposed lv method generalizes the work of @xcite to longitudinal family data with binary and continuous responses .",
    "the bayesian formulation can be desirable in practice as it offers a principled way to incorporate prior information , often available in genetic studies , and to perform finite sample likelihood - based inference .",
    "however , the bayesian model raises important computational challenges because the sampling algorithm required to study the posterior is inefficient when it is applied in its standard form .",
    "we introduce a novel algorithm that relies on the hierarchical centering and parameter expansion techniques @xcite to improve computational efficiency .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the details of the lvm and discusses the consequences of navely ignoring the family structure in the data .",
    "section 3 presents a bayesian estimation for the model parameters and a novel mcmc algorithm designed to sample the posterior distribution efficiently .",
    "section 4 discusses phenotype selection and model selection in the bayesian setting .",
    "section 5 shows results from extensive simulation studies , and section 6 applies the proposed method to a genetic study of t1d complications .",
    "section 7 concludes with recommendations and further discussions .",
    "let @xmath0 be the @xmath1 vector of outcomes / phenotypes / manifest variables measured at the @xmath2 time on the @xmath3 individual from the @xmath4 family / cluster for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where c denotes the total number of families , @xmath8 is the number of individuals within the @xmath4 family , and @xmath9 is the total number of repeated measurements . among the @xmath10 outcomes , @xmath11 are continuous and @xmath12 are binary .",
    "let @xmath13 be the lv representing the conceptual disease severity which aggregates the partial information brought by each of the @xmath10 phenotypes .",
    "in the first part of the lvm , a continuous phenotype @xmath14 is linked to the latent trait @xmath15 via a linear mixed model @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a @xmath19-dimensional vector of covariates that have direct effects on the phenotype ( direct fixed - effect covariates ) and @xmath20 is the factor loading that represents the effect of the lv on the @xmath21 phenotype . when all @xmath20s are equal to 1 , model is reduced to a mixed effect model .",
    "the random component @xmath22 captures the family - specific within - subject correlations over time .",
    "we assume @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath22 are mutually independent for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if a phenotype is binary , a generalized linear mixed model is assumed , @xmath29 with a probit link , @xmath30=p(y^b_{citj}=1|u_{cit},b_{cij})=\\phi(\\eta_{citj}).\\ ] ] we choose a probit link instead of a logit link to gain computational efficiency .",
    "specifically , we take advantage of the well - known representation of the probit model based on a normally distributed lv . if @xmath31 is the gaussian variable underlying the binary response @xmath32 , then is recovered when @xmath33 .",
    "the second part of the lvm assess the effect of @xmath34 , a @xmath35dimensional vector of variables that of primary interest ( e.g.  a genetic marker and possibly additional clinical factors ) , on the latent variable @xmath15 via a linear mixed model , @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "elements in @xmath38 are also called indirect fixed - effect covariates because their effects on a phenotype of interest @xmath39 is induced via the effect of the latent variable @xmath15 on @xmath39 modelled in first part of the lvm above .",
    "pleiotropy is detected if the element of @xmath40 corresponding to the genetic marker is found to be significant .",
    "we assume @xmath41 are the family - specific random effects and @xmath42 is the corresponding vector of covariates .",
    "similarly , @xmath43 represents the subject - specific random effects with @xmath44 its associated covariate vector .",
    "we assume that @xmath45 , @xmath46 and all random effects are independent of the @xmath47 .      the following modification of equation ( [ eqn : cts ] ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an arbitrary nonzero number , suggests that , without any restriction on @xmath50 or the variance of @xmath13 , an infinite number of equivalent models can be created .",
    "a similar phenomenon appears in the binary phenotype case . in order to avoid unidentifiability",
    ", we assume that the variance of @xmath13 is equal to 1 and that @xmath20 is non - negative . because we allow covariate effects in both parts of the lvm",
    ", we assume that the two sets of covariates are disjoint and equation ( [ eqn : latent ] ) does not contain the intercept .",
    "individuals from the same family are genetically related resulting in correlation between their latent disease status . in practice , to reduce the analytic complexity and computation burden , one may choose to assume sample independence and apply existing methods ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , ignoring the family structure will cause incorrect inference for the model parameters . to see this clearly , we assume a simplified case where the phenotypes of interest are all continuous and there are no repeated measures",
    ". the two parts of lvm are reduced to @xmath51 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , with independent error terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the variance of the @xmath21 response for individual @xmath56 from family @xmath57 can be decomposed in terms of the model parameters as : @xmath58 suppose we ignore the familial correlation in the data and propose the following model @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the individual s index and @xmath61 is the total sample size .",
    "in this case , the variance of the @xmath21 response for individual @xmath62 is decomposed as @xmath63 by equating and , we find that @xmath64 and thus it is easy to see that @xmath65 therefore , ignoring familial correlation can lead to significant underestimation of @xmath40 , the effect of a genetic marker on the lv of interest .",
    "however , the omission of existing familial correlation leads to overestimation of @xmath50 , the effect of the lv on the phenotypes of interest in the first part of the lvm , as demonstrated in the simulation studies of section 5.2 below .",
    "this is consistent with what s reported in the statistical genetics literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the longitudinal",
    "setting , as seen from equation ( [ eqn : latent ] ) , ignoring the familial correlation will also result in biased estimation of @xmath50 and @xmath40 , as well as the serial correlation @xmath66 .",
    "simulation results reported in section [ section pleiotropy simulation ] support these conclusions .",
    "however , particular to the longitudinal setting , if covariates @xmath67 are not present , the error caused by ignoring the familial correlation can be absorbed into the serial correlation and thus only @xmath66 will be incorrectly estimated .",
    "nevertheless , there is still some loss of efficiency in the estimation of @xmath50 and @xmath40 in this case .",
    "traditional solutions for lvm , including the popular software such as lisrel @xcite and mplus @xcite , rely on frequentist methods .",
    "the development of modern computational algorithms , in particular markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) , enables us to use lvm for dependent data within the bayesian paradigm .",
    "the bayesian approach also offers a principled approach to produce finite sample likelihood - based inference and to incorporate any available prior information which , in a genetic analysis setup , can be considerable .",
    "the data in our model contain the observed continuous or binary outcomes @xmath68 , the direct fixed - effect covariates @xmath69 , the indirect fixed - effect covariates @xmath38 , and the random - effect covariates @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
    "the vector of parameters of interest is @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the posterior distribution for the model parameters is @xmath79    the complexity of the sampling model requires the use of mcmc algorithms for statistical inference .",
    "unfortunately , the commonly used priors in probit and linear mixed effects models along with a run - of - the - mill sampling scheme lead to a torpidly mixing chain . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the prior specifications and the algorithmic modifications that we have implemented to improve the mcmc efficiency .",
    "we follow the data augmentation ( da ) principle of @xcite and sample alternatively from the posterior distribution given the complete data and from the lv s distribution given the observed data and the parameter values .",
    "we first discuss the sampling scheme for the relatively simple case when all the phenotypes are continuous and we then extend the algorithm to binary phenotypes .      when all the phenotypes are continuous and the conditional conjugate priors are defined for the model parameters , a standard gibbs ( sg ) sampler can be used for mcmc sampling from the posterior distribution .",
    "however , due to high dependence between the components of the markov chain corresponding to the parameter vector @xmath80 and the missing and latent data vector @xmath81 , we observe a very slow mixing of the chain .",
    "improvement can be obtained by using hierarchical centering ( hc ) @xcite .",
    "the hc technique moves the parameters up the hierarchy via model reformulation .",
    "specifically , in we move @xmath82 s up the model hierarchy to be the mean of the random effect @xmath83 so that the new random effect is @xmath84 .",
    "another technique devised to overcome the slow convergence problem of da algorithms is parameter expansion ( px ) @xcite .",
    "the idea behind px is to introduce auxiliary parameters in the model and average over all their possible values in order to produce inference for the original model of interest .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite , the benefits of this apparently circuitous strategy can be highly significant , because the larger parameter space allows the markov chain to move more freely and breaks the dependence between its components .    in our implementations ,",
    "we have observed a strong coupling between the updates of the random effect @xmath22 and its variance @xmath85 , and between the factor loading @xmath20 and the latent factor @xmath15 for all @xmath86 .",
    "for instance , an update of @xmath85 close to zero likely yields a small update of @xmath22 and vice versa .",
    "thus , we introduce auxiliary parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 and define the following _ px with hierarchical centering model ( px - hc ) _",
    "@xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . to relate the original parameters to the expanded parameters ,",
    "the following transformations are used @xmath95",
    "@xmath96    the conjugate priors used for the auxiliary parameters involved in the px scheme lead to a gibbs sampler in which each conditional distribution is available in closed form and induce the folded - t ( the absolute value of @xmath97 distribution ) prior distributions for the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath50 . more precisely , since @xmath99 in our px - hc model and @xmath100 in the original model , we have @xmath101 . when the conditional conjugate normal and inverse - gamma prior are applied to @xmath87 and @xmath102 , respectively ,",
    "the resulting prior for @xmath103 is the folded - t distribution .",
    "similarly , since @xmath104 , a half normal prior assigned to @xmath105 and inverse - gamma prior to @xmath106 will result in a folded - t prior for @xmath20 .",
    "other authors have discussed the suitability of folded - t priors in mixed effects and factor analysis models .",
    "for instance , @xcite noted the added flexibility and improved behaviour when random effects are small , and @xcite suggested the use of @xmath97 or folded - t priors for the factor loadings in a factor analysis setting .",
    "we consider independent and conjugate priors for the expanded model parameters @xmath107 .",
    "for example , we use normal priors for the fixed - effect coefficients .",
    "thus ,    @xmath108 , for @xmath86 ;    @xmath109 .    for the scale parameters , we specify conditional conjugate priors ,    @xmath110 for @xmath111 ;    @xmath112 with @xmath113 and @xmath114 ;    @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .    for the auxiliary parameters we have introduced , the priors are    @xmath118    where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the hyperparameters representing the degrees of freedom ( df ) of the induced folded - t priors for @xmath20 and @xmath85 , respectively .    for the purpose of phenotype selection , which will be discussed in detail in section 4.1",

    ", we now can apply the gibbs sampling to obtain the posterior samples .",
    "details of sampling are described in the appendix , and the key steps at a given iteration @xmath124 are :     step 1 : : :    draw @xmath125 from    @xmath126 , which    involves sampling @xmath127 ,    @xmath128 , @xmath129 ,    @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 ,    @xmath133 , @xmath134 ,    @xmath88 , @xmath135 , and   step 2 : : :    draw @xmath136 from    @xmath137 , which    involves sampling @xmath138 .",
    "suppose that the phenotypes of interest includes both continuous and binary traits .",

    "@xmath141 @xmath142 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and the prior distributions are the same as in the continuous case .",
    "a specific issue encountered here is that some of the conditional distributions required in the gibbs sampler are not available in closed form .",
    "one possible solution is to employ the da scheme proposed by @xcite that uses the underlying continuous variable @xmath143 ( discussed in section 2.1 ) as an auxiliary variable , so that all the conditional posterior densities in the expanded model can be directly sampled from .",
    "however , even in the model defined by @xmath144 we have noticed strong posterior dependence between @xmath145 and some of the model parameters which triggered a sluggish mixing of the chain .",
    "we apply an additional layer of the px scheme by introducing a working parameter @xmath146 and a one - to - one mapping @xmath147 .",
    "we use the marginal da scheme 3 of @xcite , leaving the prior distributions and the parameterization of the model unchanged .",

    "see section 5 for details of the simulations and the appendix for additional comparison plots .",
    "in medical research , it is of interest to determine if a phenotype under the study is truly relevant to the latent disease status . in the lvm setting , this is equivalent to testing if the coefficient or factor loading @xmath20 for the @xmath21 phenotype ( for continuous phenotype and for binary phenotype ) is statistically significant or not .",
    "the sign restriction on the factor loadings , @xmath161 as discussed in section 2.2 , implies that the highest posterior density interval ( hpdi ) will seldom include zero and is thus anti - conservative as a selection criterion . to assess the significance of the factor loadings , we apply the bayesian model selection method using the spike - and - slab priors @xcite .",

    "we also assume that each phenotype is measured over time five times . unless specified otherwise , the default choice is @xmath236 in the spike - and - slab prior given in , assuming no prior information on the relationship between phenotype @xmath237 and the lv . in all the simulations , we run the mcmc algorithm for 25,000 iterations , discarding the first 5,000 samples as burn - in .      to evaluate the performance of the proposed parameter estimation , we assume here that five phenotypes are of interest among which @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 are continuous , and @xmath241 and @xmath242 are binary ( tables [ tb_simulation ] and [ tb_pleiotropy_sim1 ] ) .",
    "we use a total of 100 replications to study the variation of estimates and also compare the performance of our px@xmath243hc algorithm with those of the standard algorithms .",
    "figure 1 shows that , compared to ac - px - hc , the standard px algorithm with the da scheme of @xcite , the proposed px@xmath243hc algorithm drastically reduces the autocorrelations between the chains s realizations which implies an increase in monte carlo efficiency .",
    "the improvement is also evident in figure 2 , when comparing the standard gibbs ( left column ) with the proposed px@xmath243hc scheme ( right plots ) . in the appendix ,",
    "we provide the corresponding trace plots to illustrate the improved mixing of the px@xmath243hc chain .",

    "results show that the estimates have good accuracy with small bias and rmse . however , parameter estimation for binary responses is less accurate than for continuous phenotypes , which is not surprising given the discrepancy between the information provided by the two types of data .",
    "figure [ hpdi fig ] shows that around @xmath244 of the hpdis for the factor loadings @xmath50s cover the true values .",
    "however , this remains to be validated theoretically for more general setting as results seem to suggest a matching prior type of result .      in this simulation",
    ", we only consider the three continuous phenotypes @xmath245 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 and generate data with familial and serial correlations as above in section 5.1 .",
    "we compare parameter estimates obtained using the proposed method to model the familial correlation with the estimates obtained using the method of @xcite assuming samples are independent of each other .",
    "the simulation results in table [ tb_pleiotropy_sim2 ] show that failure to account for the familial correlation present in the data will not only yield incorrect conclusion of the serial correlations between phenotypes @xmath66 , but also cause over - estimation of the factor loading @xmath20 , which quantifies the strength of the relationship between phenotype @xmath246 and the latent variable @xmath15 , and under - estimation of @xmath247 and @xmath248 , which respectively , represents the effect of the clinical covariate and genetic marker on @xmath15 .        to assess the performance of phenotype selection using the spike - and - slab prior",
    "as described in section 4.1 , we consider here four continuous phenotypes @xmath14 with factor loading @xmath20s being set to @xmath249 and three binary phenotypes @xmath250 with @xmath20s being @xmath251 .",
    "we chose these values so that the strength of the association between a phenotype and the lv @xmath15 ranges from strong ( @xmath252 ) to no association ( @xmath164 ) .",

    "after the calculation of the posterior frequency of @xmath254 for each phenotype in the 100 replicates , a threshold of @xmath255 is used on the posterior probability @xmath256 .",
    "simulation results show that the type i error of this selection procedure is about 5% in that , for the phenotype not associated with the latent disease status ( @xmath164 ) , around 5% of the replications have @xmath257 . for phenotypes moderately or strongly associated the latent variable ( @xmath258 or higher ) , we have 100% power of making the correct decision .",
    "however , power is reduced for weakly associated phenotypes as expected . specifically for the case",
    "consider here , power is 71% for the phenotype with @xmath259 and 16% for @xmath260 .",
    "we have also examined the performance of phenotype selection via bayes factors for the comparison of model @xmath175 ( assuming @xmath261 ) and model @xmath174 ( assuming @xmath262 ) using the same simulation model as in the previous section .",

    "this and combined with the sd shown in the table suggest that , for such cases , the bayes factor criterion chooses the correct alternative model @xmath266 of the times . when phenotype @xmath246 is truly not associated with the lv ( @xmath164 ) , the bayes factor criterion correctly favors the null model with the average estimated @xmath267 . however , the bayes factor criterion has little ability in identifying weakly associated phenotypes ( @xmath268 ) , which is inferior to the spike - and - slab approach in the previous section .",
    "we have also explored the use of other folded - t priors with df ranging from 3 , 10 , 40 to 90 .",
    "we find that all the prior settings give us the same conclusion on the model selection .",
    "for this purpose , we assume that there are five indirect fixed - effect covariates @xmath269 in the second part of the lvm that models the effect of the genetic marker and other covariates on the latent variable .",
    "we assume that @xmath270 is the genotype of the marker of interest and the remaining ones are standardized continuous variables .",
    "coefficients @xmath271 quantify the effects of the five covariates which are set to be @xmath272 .",
    "we also assume that there are two continuous standardized direct fixed - effect covariates @xmath273 and @xmath274 in the first part of the lvm with effects ( @xmath275 and @xmath276 ) on all the phenotypes .",
    "table [ tb_sim3.3 ] shows the estimated @xmath277 for comparing the null model assuming @xmath278 with the alternative of association . the prior distribution for @xmath40 in is @xmath279 .",
    "results show that the proposed bayes factor criterion has the ability to detect the association between the genetic marker and the latent variable , therefore pleiotropy , with the average estimated @xmath280 and sd @xmath281 .",
    "the bayes factor variable selection criterion also has good result for the two associated covariates @xmath282 and @xmath283 for which the average @xmath277 estimate is , respectively , 337.5 and 6.3 , as well as for the two covariates @xmath284 and @xmath285 with zero effect , for which the estimated @xmath277 is consistently less than @xmath286 with sd @xmath287 .",
    "here we demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed lvm method by investigating the blood pressure data from a genome - wide association study ( gaws ) of various t1d complications @xcite .",
    "the study sample consists of @xmath288 individuals with t1d from the diabetes control and complications trial ( dcct ) .",
    "various phenotypes thought be to related to t1d complication severity , including glycosylated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) and diastolic ( dbp ) and systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , were collected from each subject over the course of the dcct .",
    "additional covariates such as sex and body mass index ( bmi ) were also collected , and individuals were from two different cohorts and subjected to two treatment types ( conventional vs.  intensive ) .",
    "over 800k snps were genotyped by the illumina 1 m bead chip assay for these individuals .    because t1d is a complex disease with various complication measures ( the observed phenotypes ) , it is of great interest to quantify the conceptual latent complication status , as well as to understand the influencing factors ( both genetic markers and clinical covariates ) .",
    "in addition , it is valuable to determine if the various observed phenotypes are truly associated with the latent variable .",
    "however , due to lack of suitable statistical methodology , previous analyses have been limited to the standard uni - phenotype approach , analyzing one phenotype at a time .",
    "for example , @xcite recently performed gaws , _ separately _ , for dbp and sbp , and they identified rs7842868 on chromosome 8 as a snp significantly associated with dbp .",
    "our goal here is to formally perform a multi - phenotype analysis , jointly analyzing dbp and sbp using the proposed bayesian lvm methodology .",
    "this approach allows us not only to determine if rs7842868 is associated with the latent conceptual t1d complication variable , but also to test if dbp and sbp are truly related to the lv .",
    "it is also of practical interest to study whether there are other phenotypes such as hyperglycemia ( hpg ) influence the latent complication severity variable .    in our application",
    ", we investigate three phenotypes @xmath39 among which two are continuous ( dbp and sbp ) and one is binary ( hpg @xmath289 for hyperglycemia if and @xmath290 for normal glycemia ) , all are longitudinal .",
    "hyperglycemia at a given time point is defined if the corresponding hba1c is greater or equal to 8 . among the available covariates , based on suggestions from clinicians ,",
    "covariates @xmath69 that have direct effects on the phenotypes include bmi , and covariates @xmath38 that have direct effects on the lv include sex , cohort and treatment .",
    "among the 10 longitudinal measurements available , there are significant amount of missing data after the @xmath291 measure ( due to staggered entry ) while there are little missing data before the @xmath292 measure .",
    "therefore , we only use the first five measurements .",
    "we treat the remaining missing data as missing at random ( mar ) , and we replace the missing data with the means of all the other measurements . in this dataset , there is only one person in each family therefore there is no familial correlation , but the proposed methodology remains suitable by assuming the cluster size being 1 .",
    "we first consider rs7842868 , a snp found by @xcite to be associated with dbp . in this case",
    "@xmath282 is the genotype of rs7842868 .",
    "results in table [ tb_application ] show that dbp and sbp are clearly associated with the latent variable with estimated @xmath218 over 100 , while hpg is not .",
    "we also applied the spike - and - slab prior method for phenotype selection as discussed in sections 4.1 and 5.3.1 , the poster probability @xmath256 is 1 for dbp and sbp and 0.235 for hpg .",
    "thus all model selection criteria consistently suggest that both dbp and sbp are significantly related to the latent variable but not hpg .",
    "results also show that snp rs7842868 is significantly associated with the latent variable with estimated @xmath218 over 10 and the 95% hpdi not covering 0 .",
    "the sign of the effect suggest that the minor allele of the snp is protective in that it decreases the latent complication severity score .",
    "the combined evidence from both parts of the lvm show that rs7842868 has pleiotropic effect on the two blood pressures .",
    "sex and cohort are also found to be significantly associated with the latent variable but not treatment .",
    "we then investigate rs1358030 , a snp found by @xcite to be associated with hba1c . in this case",
    ", @xmath282 is the genotype of rs1358030 .",
    "based on results in table [ tb_application ] , there is no evidence that rs1358030 is significantly associated with the latent variable .",
    "our application here considers the binary hyperglycaemia ( hpg ) as the third phenotype of interest instead of the continuous hba1c variable . besides clinical consideration",
    ", this choice also allows us to evaluate the proposed method for general traits as described in section 3.2.2    to further evaluate the proposed method , we simulate genotypes for two null snps that are not associated with the phenotypes of interest .",
    "one snp has maf equal to 0.25 , the maf of rs7842868 ) , and the other one has maf equal to 0.35 , the maf of rs1358030 .",
    "as expected , no significant associations are detected .",
    "we propose here a bayesian latent variable approach to joint model multiple outcomes , motivated by genetic association studies of pleiotropic effects . the method can handle continuous and binary responses while accounting for serial and familial correlation structures in the data .",
    "the postulated latent variable represents the underlying severity or complication level of a trait and characterizes the totality of multiple observed phenotypes of interest .",
    "if additional phenotypes were to be measured , the latent variable could change its significance since it would encapsulate a richer set of manifest variables .",
    "the central feature of the model is that it allows us to consider the strength of dependence between the genotype and each of the phenotypes in a unified manner .",
    "the bayesian approach takes into account all the uncertainty present in the model and incorporates prior information if available .",
    "the computational challenges are met via the use of parametric expansion techniques .",
    "an important issue for pleiotropy studies is the assessment of importance of each variable .",
    "we have adopted two bayesian techniques that are shown to be effective in variable selection .",
    "we found that both bayes factor and spike - and - slab prior perform well with the latter slightly more efficient in terms of detecting weak signals .",
    "our proof - of - principle application to a genetic study of type 1 diabetes complications demonstrates the utility of the method in a real data setting .",
    "so far , genetic association studies of various t1d complication - related measures have been limited to studying one phenotype at a time .",
    "the proposed method jointly analyzes two continuous and one binary phenotypes of interest , and it provides evidence for the association between the phenotypes and the latent severity of t1d complication , the association between the latent variable and genetic markers of interest , and the effect of other covariates on the phenotypes and the latent variable .",
    "the computational load in the current implementation of the proposed method makes it impractical to perform a genome - wide search for pleiotropic genetic variants .",
    "the recent advances in parallel computing can partially alleviate this constraint .",
    "alternatively , a two - stage approach can be used in which a simple and less stringent selection procedure is first used to select a moderate number of candidate variants for further investigation using the proposed method . the uncertainty inherited from the first - stage selection , however ,",
    "must be accounted for in the models used in the second stage .",

    "<S> we present a bayesian estimation method for the model parameters , and we develop a novel mcmc algorithm that builds upon hierarchical centering and parameter expansion techniques to efficiently sample the posterior distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss phenotype and model selection in the bayesian setting , and we study the performance of two selection strategies based on bayes factors and spike - and - slab priors . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the proposed method via extensive simulations and demonstrate its utility with an application to a genome - wide association study of various complication phenotypes related to type 1 diabetes .    _ </S>",
