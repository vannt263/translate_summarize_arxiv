    "<S> e.g. , the number of returns of the comets into the inner part of the solar system are about two times greater than it is in the conventional models .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems that a comet from the oort cloud can be a source of the dinosaurs extinction at about 65 myr ago . a close encounter of a star or an interstellar cloud disturbed a comet of the oort cloud in the way that its semi - major axis increased / decreased above the value 5 @xmath0 10@xmath1 au and the comet hit the earth . </S>"
