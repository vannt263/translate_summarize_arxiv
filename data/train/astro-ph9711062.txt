    "masses of clusters of galaxies can be determined ( within a given radius ) from three independent methods : 1 ) in the optical , from velocity dispersion of galaxies in the clusters , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , zwicky , 1957 , bahcall , 1977 , peebles 1980 , carlberg , et al . , 1996 ) ; 2 ) in x - rays , from the temperature of the hot intracluster gas ( e.g. , jones and forman , 1984 , sarazin , 1986 , hughes , 1989 , evrard , et al . , 1996 ) ; and 3 ) from lensing , using weak gravitational lens distortions of background galaxies caused by the intervening cluster mass ( e.g. , tyson , et al . , 1990 , kaiser and squire , 1993 , smail , et al . , 1995 ,",
    "kneib , this volume ) .",
    "all three independent methods yield consistent results for the mass of rich clusters ( typically measured within @xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) ; ( e.g. , lubin and bahcall 1993 , bahcall 1995 , fischer and tyson 1997 , hjorth , et al . , this volume , and references therein ) .",
    "the rms scatter in the mass determination among the different methods is typically @xmath7 , with no significant bias .",
    "the observed consistency among the different methods ensures that we can reliably determine cluster masses , within the observed scatter .",
    "the masses of rich clusters range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xmath10 within @xmath11 @xmath6 radius of the cluster center . when normalized by the cluster luminosity",
    ", a median value of @xmath12 @xmath2 @xmath13 @xmath3 @xmath14 is observed for rich clusters , independent of the cluster luminosity , velocity dispersion , or other parameters .",
    "( here @xmath15 is the total blue luminosity of the cluster , corrected for internal and galactic absorption ) .",
    "( see also carlberg , et al .",
    ", this volume , for detailed results of the cnoc cluster survey . )",
    "this mass - to - light ratio , when integrated over the luminosity density of the universe , yields a dynamical mass density of @xmath16 @xmath2 @xmath17 on @xmath9 @xmath11 @xmath6 scale .",
    "this density assumes that all galaxies ( and other large structures ) exhibit the same high @xmath12 ratio .",
    "if the mass distribution is not biased , i.e. , if mass follows light on large scales , then a global @xmath1 @xmath18 @xmath17 is implied for the cosmological density parameter .",
    "if , on the other hand , as desired by theoretical considerations , the universe has a critical density ( @xmath1 @xmath19 ) , than most of the mass of the universe has to be unassociated with galaxies ( i.e. , with light , even to these large scales of @xmath9 @xmath20 ) , and reside , instead , mostly in the `` voids '' where there is no light .",
    "an @xmath1 @xmath19 universe thus requires a large bias in the distribution of mass versus light , with mass distributed considerably more diffusely than light .",
    "is there a strong bias in the universe , with most of the dark matter residing on large scales , well beyond galaxies and clusters ?",
    "a recent analysis of the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies , groups and clusters ( bahcall , lubin and dorman , 1995 ) suggests a negative reply .",
    "the study shows that while the m / l ratio of galaxies increases with scale up to radii of @xmath21 @xmath22 , due to large dark halos around galaxies , this ratio appears to flatten and remain approximately constant for groups and rich clusters , to scales of @xmath9 @xmath23 , and possibly even to the larger scales of superclusters ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the flattening occurs at @xmath24 , corresponding to @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath17 .",
    "this observation is contrary to the classical picture where the relative amount of dark matter is believed to increase with scale ( possibly reaching @xmath1 @xmath25 on large scales ) .",
    "the present data suggest that most of the dark matter may be associated with the dark halos of galaxies and that clusters do not contain a substantial amount of additional dark matter , other than that associated with ( or torn - off from ) the galaxy halos , and the hot intracluster gas .",
    "this flattening of m / l with scale , if confirmed by further larger - scale observations , suggests that the relative amount of dark matter does not increase significantly with scale ( above @xmath26 ) ; in that case , the mass density of the universe is low , @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath27 , with no significant bias .",
    "clusters of galaxies contain many baryons , observed as gas and stars . within @xmath20 of a rich cluster ,",

    "visible stars contribute another @xmath9 @xmath31 .",
    "standard big - bang nucleosynthesis limits the baryon density of the universe to @xmath32 @xmath33 ( walker , et al . , 1991 )",
    "this suggests that the baryon fraction in rich clusters exceeds that of an @xmath34 universe by a factor of @xmath35 ( white , et al . , 1993 ,",
    "lubin , et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic simulations ( above references ) show that baryons are not preferentially segregated into rich clusters .",
    "this implies that either the mean density of the universe is considerably smaller , by a factor of @xmath35 , than the critical density , or that the baryon density of the universe is much larger than predicted by nucleosynthesis . the observed baryonic mass fraction in rich clusters , combined with the nucleosynthesis limit ( walker , et al .",

    "the richest , most massive clusters are thought to form from rare high peaks in the initial mass - density fluctuations ; poorer clusters and groups form from smaller , more common fluctuations . bahcall and cen ( 1993 ) determined the mf of clusters of galaxies using both optical and x - ray observations of clusters .",
    "they compared the observed mass function of galaxy clusters with predictions of n - body cosmological simulations ( bahcall and cen 1992 ) for standard ( @xmath34 ) and low - density ( @xmath40 @xmath41 ; flat or open ) cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",

    "( a @xmath42 @xmath46 model overproduces massive clusters by an order of magnitude . )",
    "this low @xmath42 ( high bias ) model , however , is too steep at the most massive tail of the cluster mf . a low density ( @xmath36 @xmath2 @xmath37 ) cdm model , flat or open , with little or no bias , provides a good fit to the data .",

    "the evolution is so strong that finding even a few coma - like clusters at @xmath63 over @xmath9 @xmath64 of sky would contradict an @xmath34,@xmath65 @xmath2 @xmath43 model , where only @xmath9 @xmath66 such clusters would be expected .    the evolution of the abundance of massive ( coma - like ) clusters with mass @xmath39 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 is presented in fig .",

    "several effects are clearly seen in fig . 2 :    1 .",
    "the evolution of the abundance of high - mass clusters breaks the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath42 that exists at @xmath79 @xmath18 @xmath80 ; 2 .",
    "low - @xmath42 models ( high @xmath1 ) evolve much faster than high - @xmath42 models ( low @xmath1 ) .",
    "the abundance of clusters with this mass decreases by a factor of @xmath81 from @xmath82 to @xmath83 for biased ( @xmath84 @xmath85 ) scdm models , while the decrease is much shallower , only a factor of @xmath86 , for the @xmath36 @xmath2 @xmath87 @xmath88models .",
    "3 .   even at reasonably nearby redshifts of @xmath89 ,",
    "the difference in cluster abundance between high and low @xmath1 models ( low and high @xmath56 ) is very high ( factor of @xmath9 @xmath90 ) for these high mass clusters .",
    "4 .   the available data , using the cnoc cluster survey ( carlberg , et al . , 1997 ) and the distant emss survey ( luppino and gioia , 1994 ) , are consistent with the low - density models ( ocdm , lcdm ) , and inconsistent with the biased @xmath1 @xmath19 cdm models ( see fig . 2 , and bahcall , et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "too many high mass clusters are observed at @xmath91 to be consistent with @xmath1 @xmath19 , @xmath42 @xmath2 @xmath43 models ; these biased models predict a factor of @xmath81 less clusters than observed .",

    "we present these constraints in fig .",
    "3 .    fan , bahcall and cen ( 1997 ) investigate the reason for the strong ( exponential ) dependence of the evolution rate on @xmath42 ; they show that @xmath1 is determined mostly from the _ normalization _ of the cluster abundance , while @xmath42 is determined mostly from the _ rate _ of evolution .",
    "the exponential dependence of the evolution rate on @xmath42 arises because clusters of a given mass represent rarer density peaks in low @xmath42 models compared with high @xmath42 models , thus evolving considerably faster in low @xmath42 gaussian models .",
    "the high @xmath42 value required by the mild observed cluster evolution rate implies a bias parameter of @xmath94 @xmath2 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 , i.e. , a nearly unbiased universe with mass approximately following light on large scale .",
    "the @xmath98 @xmath3 @xmath99 constraint , obtained from the cluster abundance normalization for this @xmath42 value , agrees well with the _ independent _ constraints placed by cluster dynamics and by the high baryon fraction observed in clusters (  2 - 3 ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies serve as excellent tracers of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the strong cluster correlation function ( bahcall and soneira 1983 , klypin and kopylov 1983 ) was the first to reveal the common existence in the universe of large - scale structures to @xmath100 or more .",
    "the richness - dependence of the cluster correlation function ( bahcall and soneira 1983 , bahcall and west 1992 ) , is now observed for various samples of clusters ( including the apm survey ( croft , et al . , 1997 ) , with consistent results and a weakening of the richness dependence at the richest cluster tail ) .",
    "the cluster correlation function has been used successfully in constraining cosmological models . the strong amplitude and large - scale extent of the cluster correlations are inconsistent with @xmath36 @xmath19 cdm models , for any normalization ; the correlations are in good agreement with low - density , @xmath1 @xmath9 @xmath101cdm models ( bahcall and cen 1992 , croft , et al . , 1997 ) .",
