    "<S> alberg , falter , and henley @xcite studied the flavour asymmetry in the @xmath0 sea employing the meson cloud model and effective lagrangian for the baryon - meson - baryon interaction , and found large deviations from @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> more recently , ma , schmidt and yang @xcite showed that there are significant differences between the predictions of perturbative qcd and @xmath9 quark - diquark model for the flavor and spin structure of the @xmath8 baryon s quark distributions near @xmath10 .    in this letter we shall investigate the flavour asymmetry and quark - antiquark asymmetry of the @xmath0 sea using the light - cone baryon - meson fluctuation model ( lcm ) suggested by brodsky and ma @xcite . the baryon - meson fluctuation </S>",
    "<S> ( meson cloud ) mechanism is very successful in understanding on the flavour asymmetry and quark - antiquark asymmetry of nucleon sea . </S>",
    "<S> the various fluctuations can be described via corresponding baryon - meson - nucleon lagrangians @xcite . recently , brodsky and ma @xcite proposed that the baryon - meson fluctuation could be described by using a light - cone two body wave function which is a function of the invariant mass squared of the baryon - meson fock state . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the commonly used effective lagrangian method ( elm ) @xcite for the description of baryon - meson fluctuations , the lcm is relatively simple . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore our study @xcite showed that the lcm can produce very similar results to the effective lagrangian method for a suitable choice of parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea of the meson cloud model ( for recent reviews see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) is that the nucleon can be viewed as a bare nucleon surrounded by a mesonic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon wave function can be expressed in terms of bare nucleon and virtual baryon - meson fock states . </S>",
    "<S> although this model was developed mainly in the study of nucleon sea , applying this model to the other baryons is straightforward . for the @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the wave function can be written as |^+_physical = z |^+_bare + _ b m dy d^2 * k * _ _ b m(y , k_^2 ) |b(y , * k * _ ) ; m(1-y,-*k * _ ) , [ nmcm ] where @xmath11 is the wave function renormalization constant , @xmath12 is the wave function of fock state containing a baryon ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath0 , @xmath15 ) with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath16 , transverse momentum @xmath17 , and a meson ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) with momentum fraction @xmath21 , transverse momentum @xmath22 . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider the most energetically - favoured fluctuations in the baryon octet and meson octet . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation @xmath23 is neglected due to the higher mass of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 gev while @xmath26 gev , @xmath27 gev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it would seem that the fluctuation @xmath28 is also important in the calculations of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> applying the common @xmath31-@xmath32 mixing scheme = cos ( u + d -2 s ) -sin ( u + d + s ) and assuming @xmath3 symmetry for the quark distributions in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we find that compared to the fluctuation @xmath33 , the contributions to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 from the fluctuation @xmath28 are suppressed by a factor of @xmath36 which is in the range of @xmath37 for mixing angle in the theoretically accepted range @xmath38 @xcite . the higher mass of the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 gev ) also suppresses the contribution from this fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> thus we neglect this fluctuation in our calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> provided that the lifetime of a virtual baryon - meson fock state is much longer than the strong interaction time in the drell - yan process , the contribution from the virtual baryon - meson fock states to the quark and anti - quark sea of @xmath0 can be written as convolutions q(x)&=&_bm , [ qbm ] + ( x)&=&_bm ^1_x f_mb(1-y ) ^m ( ) , [ qbarbm ] where @xmath42 is fluctuation function which gives the probability for the @xmath0 to fluctuate into a virtual @xmath43 state f_bm(y)=^_0 d k_^2 | _ b m(y , k_^2)|^2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fbm ]    a common practice in the evaluation of the wave function @xmath44 is to employ time - ordered perturbative theory in the infinite momentum frame and the effective meson - baryon - nucleon interaction lagrangian @xcite . on the other hand , brodsky and ma </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggested that this wave function can also be described by using light - cone two - body wave function which is a function of the the invariant mass squared of the baryon - meson fock state _ bm(y,*k*_)=a exp , [ phi ] where @xmath45 is a phenomenological parameter which determines the shape of the fluctuation function . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the effective lagrangian method , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi ] ) is quite simple . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our study on the @xmath46-@xmath47 asymmetry in the nucleon sea @xcite showed that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi ] ) can provide similar results to the effective lagrangian method for @xmath48 gev . because the spin structure of the baryon - meson - baryon vertex is the same for all members of the baryon octet ( ignoring fluctuations to decuplet baryons ) , we might expect that the value of @xmath45 should be similar for all the members of the baryon octet </S>",
    "<S> . we will use @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev in our calculation as there is little constraint from experimental data or theoretical studies on the @xmath51 sea . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization @xmath52 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi ] ) can be determined by the probability for the corresponding fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the result given in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the probabilities of the various fluctuations and the fluctuation functions given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a given type of fluctuation are defined as the sum of all iospin states : @xmath53 . ] : p_^+=3.2% , p_p |k^0=0.4% , + p_^0 ^+=p_^+ ^0=p_=1.85% . </S>",
    "<S> [ p ]    in the baryon - meson fluctuation model , the non - perturbative contributions to the quark and the anti - quark distributions in the @xmath0 sea come from the quarks and anti - quarks of the baryons ( @xmath54 and @xmath15 ) and mesons ( @xmath55 and @xmath20 ) in the virtual baryon - meson fock states . </S>",
    "<S> so we need the parton distributions of the involved baryons and mesons as input . for the parton distribution in the pion , we employ the parameterization given by glck , reya , and stratmann ( grs98 ) @xcite and we neglect the sea content in the meson , that is , ^^+=u^^+&=&^^-=d^^-= v^ , + ^^0=u^^0&=&^^0=d^^0= v^ , + v^(x,_nlo^2 ) & = & 1.052 x^-0.495 ( 1 + 0.357 ) ( 1-x)^0.365 , [ vpion ] at scale @xmath56 gev@xmath57 . for the @xmath6 distribution in the @xmath20 we relate it to the @xmath58 distribution in the @xmath59 which are given in the grs98 parameterization @xcite also ^|k^0(x,_nlo^2)=u^k^+(x,_nlo^2 ) </S>",

    "<S> in order to investigate the quark - antiquark asymmetry via @xmath60 in the @xmath0 sea , we also need to know the @xmath5-quark distribution in the @xmath8 , @xmath0 and @xmath15 , for which we use the parameterization for the @xmath5 quark distribution in the proton given by glck , reya , and vogt ( grv98 ) @xcite , d^p(x,_nlo^2)=0.400 x^-0.57 ( 1-x)^4.09 ( 1 + 18.2 x ) , at scale @xmath61 gev@xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> we evolve the distributions to the scale @xmath62 gev@xmath57 using the program of miyama and kumano @xcite in which the evolution equation is solved numerically in a brute - force method . </S>",
    "<S> we found that at @xmath63 gev@xmath57 all parton distributions @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be parameterized using the following form q(x , q^2)=a x^b ( 1-x)^c ( 1+d + e </S>",
    "<S> x ) [ qfit ] with the parameters given in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the uncertainty in solving the evolution equations numerically and parameterizating the parton distribution in the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qfit ] ) to be about @xmath67 in the @xmath68-region which we are interested in _ i.e. _ @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of evolution from a lower scale to a higher scale is to make the parton distribution more concentrated in the small @xmath68 region . </S>",
    "<S> thus we may expect that the @xmath68 position at which an asymmetry exhibits a maximum will move to smaller @xmath68 as we evolve to higher values of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not expect the asymmetry to  evolve away \" at a higher @xmath70 scale if it exists at a lower scale such as @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the flavour asymmetry in the @xmath0 sea through calculating the differences between the antiquark distributions : @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] which are given by x&= & x + & = & ^1_x dy , [ xdmu ] x&= & x + & = & ^1_x dy , [ xdms ] x&= & x _ </S>",

    "<S> it can be found that the contribution from the fluctuation @xmath33 is about twice as large as that from @xmath79 , and both are much larger than the contribution from @xmath80 . under evolution </S>",
    "<S> the distributions move from larger @xmath68 to smaller @xmath68  the @xmath68 position at which @xmath72 $ ] exhibits a maximum shifts from about @xmath82 to @xmath83 and the maximum decreases about @xmath84 , which coincides with our naive expection . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results for @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] at @xmath63 gev@xmath57 are given in figs .  2 and 3 for @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that @xmath85 , that is the anti - quark distribution in the @xmath0 sea is flavour asymmetric .    as is well known , the nucleon sea is also asymmetric and for the proton sea @xmath86 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the proton@xmath87 and @xmath88 is the replacement of a valance @xmath5 quark by a valance @xmath46 quark . </S>",
    "<S> thus one may expect from @xmath3 symmetry that the @xmath88 sea to be @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is opposite to our above conclusion ( @xmath86 ) from the light - cone baryon - meson fluctuation model . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath3 symmetry breaking in the @xmath90 , @xmath6 and @xmath47 distributions in the @xmath0 sea has the same source as that for the @xmath58 , @xmath5 , and @xmath46 quark masses , we may expect that @xmath72 < x[\\ubar(x)-\\sbar(x)]$ ] since the mass difference between the @xmath58 and @xmath5 quarks is far smaller than that between the @xmath58 and @xmath46 quarks . </S>",
    "<S> however , our calculations ( see figs .  2 and 3 ) show that @xmath73 > x[\\dbar(x)-\\ubar(x ) ] > x[\\ubar(x)-\\sbar(x)]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> > x[\\ubar(x)-\\sbar(x)]$ ] is opposite to our above argument , which implies that the dynamics responsible for the @xmath3 symmetry breaking in the quark distributions of the @xmath0 sea , as calculated in our model , are different from that responsible for the mass differences among the @xmath58 , @xmath5 and @xmath46 quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question concerning the @xmath0 sea is the quark - antiquark asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> although the perturbative sea created from gluon - splitting is symmetric @xmath91 ( in the leading twist approximation in perturbative calculation ) , the non - perturbative sea , which may exist over a long time and has a strong connection with the  bare \" @xmath0 , may be asymmetric @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the existence of valance @xmath58 and @xmath46 quarks in the @xmath0 , it is difficult to measure the differences @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the @xmath0 sea . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely experiment is to measure the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . from the baryon - meson fluctuation model </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 turns out to be : d(x)-(x)&= & d_^+(x)-_^+(x ) + d_^0 ^+(x)-_^0 ^+(x ) + d_p |k^0(x)-_p    & = & ^1_x \\ { d^p ( ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ dmd ] the numerical results at scales @xmath71 and @xmath63 gev@xmath57 are presented in fig .  4 . once again one can find that evolution </S>",
    "<S>  pushes \" the distributions to the small @xmath68 region . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that @xmath95 in the @xmath0 sea </S>",
    "<S> . however , the prediction for the behavior of @xmath60 depends strongly on the value of @xmath45  for @xmath49  gev @xmath96 in the smaller @xmath68 region and @xmath97 in the larger @xmath68 region , while for the @xmath48  gev @xmath97 in the smaller @xmath68 region and @xmath98 in the larger @xmath68 region . </S>",
    "<S> this result is similar to our earlier finding on the @xmath99 in the nucleon sea @xcite employing the same light - cone baryon - meson fluctuation model , which suggests that @xmath3 symmetry in the sea holds in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn to the discussion about @xmath45-dependence in our calculation . comparing figs </S>",
    "<S> .  2 and 3 one can find that for the @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] the shape and maximum of asymmetries are very similar for different @xmath45 , while the @xmath68 position at which the asymmetries exhibit maxima shifts slightly . the calculations with @xmath49  gev peak at about @xmath100 while the calculations with @xmath48  gev peak at about @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the calculations for the flavour asymmetry are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath45 , and @xmath68 being about @xmath102 is a good region to study the flavor asymmetry in the @xmath0 sea . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is consistent with the prediction given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  the region @xmath103 should be a good one to measure the flavour asymmetry in the @xmath51 sea . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation for the @xmath60 ( see fig .  4 ) is much more sensitive to the value of @xmath45 than that for the flavour asymmetry  the calculations with @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev even give opposite predictions for the @xmath68-dependence of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we may expect that further calculation @xcite on the nucleon sea employing the light - cone baryon - meson fluctuation model may provide useful constraints on the value of @xmath45 , and thereby give more definite predictions on the sea quark content in the @xmath0 baryon .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , besides the nucleon sea the studies on the sea quark content of the other members of the baryon octet are interesting and important since it is helpful to our understanding of both the structure of the octet baryons and non - perturbative qcd effects such as @xmath3 symmetry breaking and flavour asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the sea quark content of the @xmath0 baryon employing the light - cone baryon - meson fluctuation model . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the @xmath0 sea is flavour asymmetric ( @xmath104 ) and quark - antiquark asymmetric ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our prediction for the flavor asymmetry , @xmath1 , is significantly different from the @xmath3 prediction ( @xmath4 ) , while our prediction for the @xmath5-@xmath6 asymmetry is consistent with the @xmath3 prediction . </S>"
