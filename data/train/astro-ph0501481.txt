    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are old , gravitationally bound stellar systems whose core stellar densities can be extremely high , reaching up to @xmath5 . in such an environment , close encounters and even direct collisions with resulting mergers between the cluster stars are quite common , leading to a variety of dynamically - formed stellar objects like blue stragglers ( bss ) and close binary ( cb ) systems .",
    "cbs are important for our understanding of gc evolution , since the binding energy of a few , very close binaries can rival that of a modest - sized globular cluster .",
    "thus , by transferring their orbital energy to passing single stars , cbs can significantly affect the dynamical evolution of the cluster ( e.g.  elson et al .",
    "1987 , hut et al .",
    "1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "this depends critically on the number of cbs .",
    "if there are only a few cbs , long - term interactions dominate the cluster evolution . by contrast",
    ", the presence of many cbs leads to violent interactions , which heat the cluster , and promote its expansion and evaporation .",
    "interacting cbs form a particularly interesting subset of cbs , and can , in principle , also be used as tracers of a cluster s cb population .",
    "the best - known formation channel for interacting cbs in gcs is tidal capture of a red giant or main sequence ( ms ) star by a compact object @xcite .",
    "this scenario was originally proposed to account for the overabundance of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) containing accreting neutron stars ( nss ) in gcs , relative to the galactic field .",
    "however , tidal capture theory predicts a comparable overabundance of interacting cbs with a white dwarf ( wd ) primary , i.e. cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "since wds are far more common than nss , we would then also expect many more cvs than lmxbs in gcs .",
    "more recently , it has been realized that 3-body encounters ( e.g. davies & benz 1995 ) and `` ordinary '' evolution of primordial binaries ( e.g. davies 1997 ) may also produce significant populations of cvs in gcs .",
    "cvs produced from primordial binaries are expected mainly in the outskirts of clusters , whereas cvs formed dynamically ( through tidal capture or 3-body processes ) should be found preferentially in the dense cluster cores .",
    "thus , the observation of the relative abundances and distribution of cvs within a cluster s core and halo can tell us about the relative efficiency of these different cv formation scenarios .",
    "however , despite their impact on cluster evolution and their importance for our understanding of cb formation and evolution channels , there have been only a few detections of interacting cbs in gcs during the past decades .",
    "finding and studying these systems has proven to be extremely difficult , since the spatial resolutions and detection limits of most available telescopes are too limited for their detection . only with the improved sensitivity and imaging quality of _ chandra _ and _ hst _",
    "has it become possible to finally detect significant numbers of cvs and other binary systems in gcs ( e.g.grindlay et al .",
    "2001 ; albrow et al .  2001",
    "; edmonds et al .  2003a , 2003b ; knigge et al .",

    "@xmath0-imaging is particularly well - suited for the detection of cvs ( and also bss and young wds ) in gc cores .",
    "this is because these objects are characterized by relatively blue spectral energy distributions and emit significant amounts of radiation in the @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , the `` ordinary '' stars that make up the bulk of the cluster are too cool to show up in observations at such short wavelengths . as a consequence , crowding is not a severe problem in @xmath0 imaging studies of gcs , even in the dense cluster cores .",
    "this is a significant advantage compared to optical gc surveys .    to date , the only deep @xmath0 study of a globular cluster with the principal purpose of identifying cvs ( as well as bss and wds ) has been of 47  tuc @xcite .",
    "there , we found 16 cv candidates ( including 4 variable objects that were previously known or suspected cataclysmics ) , 19 bss ( including 4 variables ) and 17 hot wds .",
    "the population of cv candidates was particularly interesting , since their number was broadly consistent with tidal capture predictions ( but note that most of these candidates have not yet been confirmed ) .    here ,",
    "we present a reanalysis of _ hst_-based @xmath0 observations of another gc , namely ngc2808 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "this intermediate metallicity gc ( @xmath8 } = -1.36 $ ] , walker 1999 ) lies at a distance of 10.2 kpc and is reddened by @xmath9 mag ( bedin et al .",
    "the cluster has a very dense and compact core , with a core radius of @xmath10 and a tidal radius of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the data set that we analyse in the following has already been studied by @xcite , but with a focus on the bright , blue hb stars in the cluster core .",
    "more specifically , @xcite discovered a population of subluminous horizontal branch stars in ngc2808 which might have undergone a late helium flash while descending the wd cooling curve .",
    "by contrast , here we are mainly interested in the dynamically - formed stellar populations ( cvs and bss ) , as well as the young wds in this cluster .",
    "since these are faint objects and normally difficult to detect , we first construct a new , deep colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) in which many of these objects show up , and then search for variability amongst our @xmath0 sources ( since this is ubiquitous amongst cvs and also seen in bss located in the instability strip ) .    in sect .",
    "[ data ] , we discuss the data and the data reduction . in sect .",
    "[ results ] , we present our far- vs. near - ultraviolet cmd and describe our search for variability among our catalogue stars .",
    "our results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "ngc2808 was observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the _ hst _ in january / february 2000 .",
    "the original purpose of these observations was to provide geometric distortion corrections for the stis camera",
    ". however , such calibration data are of course also of scientific interest , as already shown by @xcite .",
    "images were taken using the f25qtz and f25cn270 filters , which are located in the far- and near - uv wavebands , with central wavelengths of 1590   ( @xmath0 , f25qtz ) and 2700   ( @xmath12 , f25cn270 ) , respectively .",
    "the plate scale is @xmath13 , resulting in a field of view of @xmath14 for both filters .",
    "the exposure times for the single exposures vary between 480 and 538 sec .",
    "the observations were positioned on the cluster centre ; fig .",
    "[ fuv ] shows the combined images .",
    "the mosaic images were constructed using montage2 @xcite , which registers all the image frames to a single reference frame - incorporating shift , scale , rotation , and distortions determined from positions of the brightest stars .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath12 mosaic images show a strange shape that is due to the small offsets and rotation of the single exposures with respect to each other .",
    "the diameter of the mosaics is @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "since the cluster s core radius is @xmath17 , the complete core is covered by our mosaic images .    as can be seen immediately , the @xmath12 mosaic is extremely crowded .",
    "crowding , on the other hand , is not a problem in the @xmath0 image .",
    "note that the effective exposure times vary strongly across both mosaics .",
    "this is responsible for the increased background noise in the outskirts of the mosaics , where exposure times are low compared to the central regions ( which have maximum exposure times of 8906 sec [ @xmath12/f25cn270 ] and 8916 sec in the [ @xmath0/f25qtz ] ) .      as already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , we reinvestigate the same dataset studied by @xcite , but with a different focus . here",
    ", our main goal is to search for faint and/or variable @xmath0 sources ( cvs , bss , wds ) .",
    "we therefore take special care to detect even weak sources in the @xmath0 images , which allows us to construct a very deep cmd .    as noted above",
    ", the exposure time is not uniform across the @xmath0 mosaic , which means that the outer parts of the image ( with the lowest exposure times ) have the noisiest background . in order to avoid both a large number of false detections in these regions ( caused by noise peaks ) , and multiple detections in the halos of bright stars",
    ", we created a noise map which we used to `` smooth '' the image .",
    "as a first step , we then used the daofind routine of daophot @xcite running under iraf on the smoothed image to detect @xmath0 sources .",
    "we overplotted the resulting source coordinates on the @xmath0 mosaic and inspected them by eye .",
    "overall , this source finding technique appeared to work well for bright sources ( except for a few multiple detections around bright stars that we deleted by hand ) .",
    "however , it did not work as well for faint sources , especially in the deep , central part of the mosaic .",
    "thus , we added a further 211 sources by hand . in total , our catalogue of @xmath0 sources contains 521 entries .",
    "source detection in the @xmath12 mosaic is a tedious task due to the severe crowding and depends critically on the daofind detection threshold .",
    "if the detection threshold is too high , no faint sources will be detected in the centre of the mosaic ( which has maximum exposure time ) .",
    "the situation can be improved by lowering the detection threshold , but this also leads to false `` detections '' in the noisy outskirts .",
    "( the same is true for the @xmath0 mosaic , but less of a problem , since crowding is much less severe .",
    "we could therefore simply adopt a relatively high threshold in daofind and add the missing sources by hand . )",
    "however , it is important to realize that our goal is not to detect all @xmath12 sources , but to locate @xmath12 counterparts to our @xmath0 sources . in practice",
    ", we therefore chose to work with an intermediate threshold , designed to yield most of the detectable @xmath12 counterparts while keeping the number of false detections at bay .",
    "this is important , because if there are too many false detections , some will be matched erroneously to real @xmath0 sources .",
    "in order to match the @xmath0 and @xmath12 catalogues , we first transformed the @xmath12 coordinates onto the frame of the @xmath0 mosaic .",
    "we then checked for common pairs within a tolerance of 1.5 pixels ; this resulted in 306 matches .",
    "careful inspection of the registered @xmath12 image around unmatched @xmath0 sources revealed an additional 50 @xmath12 counterparts within this tolerance that had not been detected by daofind . increasing",
    "the tolerance to 2 pixels added another 23 matches .",
    "these additional matches are located mainly in the outskirts of the mosaic where our coordinate transformation is slightly less accurate , thus justifying an increased matching tolerance .",
    "all stars listed in @xcite were found in our @xmath0 catalogue ; however , 25 of them did not have @xmath12 matches within 2 pixels .",
    "closer inspection by eye revealed that these stars are either located in the outer regions of the mosaic and had probable @xmath12 counterparts outside the 2 pixel tolerance radius , or they had faint @xmath12 counterparts that are located in the most crowded inner area and were not initially detected by daofind .",
    "we therefore added these missing matches by hand .",
    "a catalogue listing all of our @xmath0 sources is given in table  [ catalogue ] .",
    "we include sources without @xmath12 counterparts in table  [ catalogue ] , because these are likely to include additional wd and cv candidates .",
    "source may lack a @xmath12 counterpart because ( i ) it is too faint and blue to show up in the @xmath12 mosaic or ( ii ) a counterpart exists , but was not found due to the severe crowding in the @xmath12 image . ] among the sources with @xmath12 counterparts , we have marked all pairs that were matched with the higher tolerance of 2 pixel or were added by hand . in total ,",
    "our catalogue contains 521 @xmath0 sources , including 403 with @xmath12  counterparts .",
    "all 295 sources listed in @xcite are also contained in our catalogue .",
    "aperture photometry was obtained using daophot @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we chose an aperture radius of 4 pixels and used an annulus between 4 and 10 pixel for sky subtraction .",
    "an exposure map was created that accounts for the different exposure times at different locations in the composite image . for the calibration to the stmag - system we used the aperture corrections derived by @xcite , namely 1.83 and photflam of 1.11e-16 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 for the f25qtz data , and 1.44 and photflam of 3.92e-17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 for the fluxes obtained with f25cn270 .",
    "@xmath19 @xmath20 ( not 3.29e-17 @xmath18 @xmath21 @xmath20 ) ]    the results of aperture photometry depend on the coordinates of the source that has to be measured , or , to be more precise , on the `` centering '' .",
    "several re - centering algorithms are available under phot in daophot running under iraf .",
    "@xcite created their coordinate list by centering on each star by eye .",
    "we used their photometry as a point of reference , and hence adopted a gaussian recentering algorithm , since this yielded the best agreement with their measurements .",
    "[ centerings ] displays the magnitude differences between our photometry and that of @xcite , in both @xmath0  and @xmath12  bands .",
    "overall , the agreement is very good , with a few notable exceptions discussed below .",
    "for star no .  516 ( i d .  29 in brown et al . , 2001 )",
    "the difference between our photometry and brown et al.s ( 2001 ) is 0.6 mag in @xmath0 .",
    "this star is located in the outer regions of the @xmath0  mosaic and appears somewhat elongated .",
    "this might be because the object is a blend of two sources , or because the psf is smeared out since the coordinate transformations used to construct our mosaic are least reliable in the outermost regions of the image .",
    "the latter effect would be exacerbated by the asymmetric @xmath0  psf and might cause the brightness to be underestimated when using a small aperture of only 4 pixels .",
    "the situation is similar for star no .",
    "500 ( i d .  13 in brown et al.2001 ) , which is 0.45 mag fainter in our photometry , is also located close to the edges of the mosaic and appears somewhat elongated",
    ". however , a difference greater than 0.1 mag in the @xmath0 occurred only for 17 stars , and a difference greater than 0.15 mag only for 5 stars .    for the @xmath12",
    ", we found a magnitude difference of 0.985 mag for star no .  426 ( i d .  189 in @xcite ) .",
    "this seems to be a case where @xcite matched a different @xmath12 source than we did .",
    "though we are quite confident that we correctly matched most of the stars in @xmath0 and @xmath12 , this discrepancy is a useful reminder that occasional mismatches might still occur due to the extreme crowding in the @xmath12 images .",
    "this is especially true for fainter sources , and mismatches probably contribute to the rising @xmath12 differences towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "however , differences greater than 0.15 mag occurred for only 18 stars in the @xmath12 . setting aside these extreme cases , the mean absolute differences between brown et al.s ( 2001 ) magnitudes and ours are @xmath22 mag in @xmath0 and @xmath23 mag in @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in general , there is good agreement between their catalogue and ours .",
    "the remaining differences can be explained by the different methods used to construct the mosaic images , to detect the sources , the different centering algorithms for the photometry and by the severe crowding in the @xmath12 images .",
    "fig .  [ cmd ] shows the @xmath1 cmd of ngc2808 s core region .",
    "several distinct stellar populations can be seen , including blue hb stars , bss , wds , but also cv candidates .",
    "our cmd reaches approximately 2 magnitudes deeper than that presented by @xcite .",
    "this is because we took special care in detecting faint sources in the @xmath0 mosaic ( sect .",
    "[ find ] ) .",
    "we also note that we plot all sources independent of their photometric errors , whereas @xcite only included sources satisfying @xmath24 mag and @xmath25 mag in both @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , we stress that only 7 of the sources plotted have errors exceeding 0.2 mag in @xmath0 , and all of these have errors in the range 0.2 - 0.3 mag .",
    "we therefore still regard these as significant detections .    to aid in the interpretation of the cmd ,",
    "we have also calculated and plotted a set of theoretical tracks . in the following",
    ", we will first briefly describe the construction of the theoretical tracks and then discuss the various stellar populations within our cmd .      since main sequence stars and red giants are too cool to show up in our cmd , we only present theoretical tracks for the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) , the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) and the wd cooling curve in ngc2808 .    for our zahb track ,",
    "we interpolated on the grid of oxygen - enhanced zahb models provided by @xcite to generate a set of models at the cluster metallicity of @xmath8 } = -1.36 $ ] .",
    "we then used synphot within iraf / stsdas to calculate the @xmath0 and @xmath12 magnitudes of stars on this sequence .",
    "this was achieved by interpolating on the kurucz grid of model stellar atmospheres and folding the resulting synthetic spectra through the response of the appropriate filter+detector combinations .",
    "the zams is included because bss are expected to lie near and slightly to the red of this sequence . in order to generate this track",
    ", we used the fitting formulae of @xcite to estimate the appropriate stellar parameters .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 and @xmath12 colours were then again estimated from the kurucz model grid within synphot .",
    "finally , our theoretical wd sequence was constructed by interpolating on the @xcite grid of theoretical wd cooling curves , adopting a mean wd mass of 0.55  m@xmath26 .",
    "the models were then again translated to the observational plane by carrying out synthetic photometry with synphot , using a grid of synthetic da wd spectra kindly provided by boris gnsicke ( see gnsicke , beuermann & de martino 1995 ) .    for all our synthetic tracks we adopted a distance of 10.2 kpc and a reddening of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "ngc2808 is one of the most extreme examples among the globular clusters with unusual hb morphology , as first noted by @xcite .",
    "since then this cluster has received considerable attention . in general ,",
    "metallicity is regarded to be the first parameter that influences hb morphology . however ,",
    "several globular clusters show different hb morphologies though their metallicities are similar @xcite .",
    "this led to the suggestion of a second parameter responsible for the unusual behaviour of the hbs in these clusters .",
    "many parameters have been suggested ( e.g.  age , mass loss , stellar rotation etc . ) , but a thoroughly convincing explanation is still lacking ( see e.g. rood et al .",
    "1993 , recio - blanco et al .  2004 ) .",
    "ngc2808 shows a bimodal hb and one of the longest blue hb tails , the so - called extreme hb ( ehb ) , with prominent gaps between the red hb ( rhb ) , blue hb ( bhb ) and ehb ( e.g. clement & hazen 1989 , ferraro et al .  1990 ,",

    "@xcite discussed various mechanisms that might be responsible for the hb multimodality , none of which represents a satisfactory explanation .",
    "they suggested that a combination of effects might result in such a hb morphology , some of which might be unique to ngc2808 .    in our cmd ,",
    "the two distinct clumps of bright stars around @xmath27 mag correspond to the blue ( @xmath28 mag ) and extreme ( @xmath29 mag ) hb stars .",

    "instead , the ehb clump is extended towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "@xcite suggested that these subluminous ehb stars ( as well as the ehb gap in the optical cmds ) can be explained by a late helium - core flash that these stars undergo while they descend the wd sequence .",
    "the recent findings of @xcite and @xcite generally support this theory . for a comprehensive analysis of the hb stars in the @xmath1  cmd",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "a trail of stars can be seen in fig  [ cmd ] , starting from the bhb clump and reaching down below the theoretical zahb sequence towards the faint red corner of our cmd .",
    "these sources show magnitudes fainter than the zahb , but brighter than the zams .",
    "the location of these objects agrees with the expected location of bss , which are thought to be dynamically - formed objects resulting from a collision or coalescence of two or more ms stars .",
    "they are more massive than normal cluster ms stars and therefore we expect them to be already somewhat evolved",
    ". this explains their location slightly above and to the red of the zams .",

    "we estimate that there are @xmath40 sources in this `` cv zone . ''",
    "how does this number compare to theoretical predictions ?",
    "we can attempt to answer this question by scaling the number of tidal capture cvs predicted for 47tuc to ngc2808 . to this end , we use the simplified estimate for the capture rate in globular cluster cores @xcite    @xmath41 ,    where @xmath42 is the central luminosity density and @xmath43 the core radius . based on this , we find that the total number of dynamically - formed cvs in ngc2808 should be quite similar to 47tuc , in which @xcite predicted a population of @xmath44 active cvs formed via tidal capture . for 47tuc",
    ", @xcite found that approximately half of the captures would take place within 1 core radius .",
    "a cv formed outside the core will drift towards the centre due to mass segregation . thus a given active cv should be found in the core today if its age exceeds the relaxation time - scale at the location where it formed .",
    "given our detection limits , we can not hope to detect the very oldest cvs , since these are also the faintest . in order to obtain a rough estimate",
    ", we will assume that we can detect most cvs whose secondaries have not yet been whittled down to brown dwarfs , but none of the latter .",
    "thus our dividing line is between cvs whose orbital periods are still decreasing , and the so - called period bouncers , whose periods are lengthening ( see distefano & rappaport , 1994 , for details ) . based on fig .  2 in @xcite , the oldest cvs we can detect will therefore have ages on the order of @xmath45  yrs .",
    "this is comparable to the relaxation time - scale at the half - mass radius of ngc2808 , so some , but probably not all dynamically - formed active cvs should have had time to reach the core .",
    "given this ambiguity , we assume that between 50% and 100% of active cvs in ngc2808 should be within our field of view .",
    "however , only about half of these are above our adopted detection limit , yielding a final prediction between @xmath46 cvs .",
    "we stress that this is an extremely rough estimate , but it does bracket the observed number of sources in our cv zone .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of these candidates might indeed be cvs .",
    "we caution that other sources might also occupy our cv zone .",
    "we have to consider the possibility that mismatches might have occurred , though special care has been taken in detecting and matching the @xmath0 and @xmath12 sources ( see sect .",
    "[ find ] and [ photometry ] ) .",
    "non - interacting wd / ms binaries without accretion would also lie in the cv zone .",

    "the differences in the observed distributions might reflect the different masses of the various fuv populations .",
    "more specifically , cvs and bss are expected to be considerably more massive than wds and hbs , since cvs are wd / ms binaries and bss are roughly speaking ms stars with masses above the cluster ms turn - off .",
    "the heavy cvs and bss thus sink toward the cluster core and as a result are more centrally concentrated than the lighter wds and hbs .",
    "[ cumulative ] shows that the differences revealed by the k - s test are indeed in the expected direction .    on the other hand , cvs and bss",
    "are believed to be objects formed through two- or three - body interactions such as tidal capture , collisions and mergers .",
    "these dynamical interactions take place preferentially in the dense cluster core .",
    "thus , cvs and bss may also be expected to be overabundant in the cluster core because this is their birthplace .    in either case , the enhanced central concentration of our cv candidates provides additional evidence that most of these sources are indeed cvs or non - interacting wd / ms binaries ( as opposed to chance superpositions , foreground stars , etc ) , i.e.  they either segregated towards the cluster centre , or they formed in the dense core region .",
    "@xcite presented optical photometry for 74 globular clusters , among them ngc2808 .",
    "the clusters were observed with _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 bands , with the pc centred on each cluster s centre .",
    "we searched for optical counterparts to our @xmath0 sources in their dataset , using xyxymatch within iraf .",
    "the transformation between the pc and stis physical coordinate systems is tied to three hb stars as reference objects which could be clearly identified by eye in both the @xmath50 and the @xmath0 images .",
    "following @xcite , we allowed for a maximum difference of 0.8 pc pixels ( corresponding to 1.5 stis pixels ) . in total , we found 97 counterparts to our @xmath0 sources .",
    "out of these 9 are matches with ms stars , red giants or rhb stars .",
    "these stars are too cool to show up in our @xmath1 cmd , and thus these matches have to be explained otherwise : 13156 objects are present in the pc field - of - view in both optical bands , and the complete pc field is covered by our @xmath0 mosaic .",
    "in addition , 390 @xmath0 sources are located inside the area covered by the pc - data . following the same statistical approach as in @xcite",
    ", we would expect up to 13 false matches .",
    "thus , all the matches with ms stars and red giants can be explained statistically as false matches .",
    "the remaining 88 matches are all blue objects , either bhb or ehb or bs stars .",
    "we marked all our @xmath0 sources for which we could find a blue optical counterpart as crosses in our @xmath1 cmd , and added their optical magnitudes and i d from @xcite to our table  [ catalogue ] .",
    "as can be seen , one of our cv candidates , our star no .  170 , does have an optical counterpart with @xmath51 mag and @xmath52 mag .",
    "the blue optical colour of the counterpart ( well off the cluster ms ) , and the quality of the @xmath0/optical match ( the @xmath0 and optical positions agree to within 0.4 pixels ) both suggest that the counterpart identification is secure .      as a first check for possible variability among our catalogue stars we performed photometry on all single @xmath0 images . for this purpose",
    "we first used the processed images that had been used to create the mosaic , i.e.  these images were shifted and rotated to a common logical ( i.e. image pixel ) coordinate system .",
    "the great advantage is that we can use our coordinate list derived from the @xmath0 mosaic as an input to all of these processed images .",
    "the photometry was carried out in the same way as described above in sect .",

    "the same stars show an excess @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) .    as a next step",
    ", we used the non - processed images to get more precise magnitudes for our 28 variable candidates .",
    "this is necessary , because the orientation of the psf on these images is the same with respect to each image and not rotated as for the processed images that were used for creating the mosaic . since these images now do not share a common logical coordinate system",

    "79 , 114 , 175 and 269 of our table  [ catalogue ] show very high @xmath53 , however , these stars are located very close to bright stars , which makes it difficult to get accurate coordinates on the single images that have much shorter single exposure times than the mosaic .",
    "consequently , these stars do not stand out as clearly as they do on the @xmath0 mosaic , and sometimes it is not possible to distinguish them from the halo of the nearby bright star .",

    "our cmd reveals a number of stars that are located in the cv region between the wd cooling curve and the zams .",
    "approximately 60 sources can be found in this region , but we caution that due to the photometric scatter the discrimination between the individual zones can be difficult . using a simplified estimate for the capture rate in globular cluster cores @xcite , we found that the number of dynamically - formed cvs in the core of ngc2808 is comparable to 47tuc , and broadly consistent with the number of candidates we detected .",
    "this suggests that many of our candidates might indeed be cvs .",
    "the cumulative radial distributions of the individual stellar populations indicate that our bs and cv candidates are more centrally concentrated than hbs and the wd candidates .",
