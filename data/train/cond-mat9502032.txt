    "the fermionic chern  simons theory has been extensively used in the last few years to describe the physics of a two dimensional electron gas in a partially filled landau level @xcite  @xcite . in that theory , the problem of electrostatically interacting electrons in a strong magnetic field is converted , using an exact transformation , to a problem of electrostatically interacting `` transformed fermions '' which also interact with a chern  simons gauge field .",
    "being still unsolvable , the transformed fermion problem is studied by approximations .",
    "the simplest approximation , mean field theory , already gives interesting physical results .",
    "for example , it predicts the existence of stable quantized hall states at filling fractions of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary integer , and @xmath2 is an even positive integer , equal to the number of quanta of chern  simons flux attached to each fermion . as was first noted by jain @xcite ,",
    "filling fractions of the above form , with @xmath3 , are the most prominent fractional hall states seen in the lowest landau level .",
    "( jain s `` composite fermions '' may be regarded as equivalent to the transformed fermions , projected onto the lowest electronic landau level . ) by contrast , at the even denominator fractions @xmath4 , the fermion chern ",
    "simons mean field theory predicts a fermi  liquid state , with no energy gap and no quantized hall effect @xcite@xcite .    for a description of the excitation spectrum and of other quantities of interest ,",
    "it is of course necessary to go beyond mean field theory .",
    "specifically , it is necessary to consider , using perturbation theory , the effects of fluctuations in the chern ",
    "simons field and of the two body interaction , effects which are omitted from mean field theory .",
    "consequences of these perturbations were explored at some length by halperin , lee and read ( hlr)@xcite for the fermi liquid state at @xmath5 , and also to some degree for other nearby filling fractions .",
    "an interesting result of the hlr analysis was the prediction that at @xmath5 the effective mass @xmath6 of the transformed fermions diverges for quasi ",
    "particles at the fermi energy . for the physically relevant case of coulomb interaction between the electrons ,",
    "this divergence was found to be quite weak , i.e. , logarithmic in @xmath7 , the energy relative to the fermi energy . for short range electron ",
    "electron interaction hlr found a stronger divergence @xmath8 , while for a longer range interaction the effective mass remains finite as @xmath9 .",
    "the hlr results were based on an examination of the leading diagrams in the perturbation expansion for small @xmath10 , supplemented by heuristic arguments that the leading singularity might not be affected by higher orders in perturbation theory . consequently , it is of interest to see whether these arguments can be made more convincing , or whether by contrast results contradictory to hlr may be obtained .",
    "interest in these questions has been stimulated by the fact that similar effective mass divergences are found in other models in which fermions interact strongly with a fluctuating gauge field , including models that have been advanced in the context of high @xmath11 superconductivity @xcite@xcite .    assuming that the effective mass divergence predicted by hlr is indeed correct",
    ", one may ask what physically measurable quantities might reflect it . according to hlr , the renormalized mass should @xmath12 show up in the long wavelength density and current response functions at zero temperature , for @xmath13 .",
    "this observation was confirmed , more recently , by analyses using a variety of theoretical techniques , including renormalization group methods @xcite@xcite , bosonization @xcite and diagrammatic analyses@xcite .",
    "moreover , kim _",
    "et.al._@xcite , using an approximation that takes into account the leading divergent contribution to @xmath6 , have shown that there is no corresponding singularity in the density response function in the limit of low frequencies and long wavelengths , for _ any _ value of @xmath14 .",
    "within their approximation , the density response function looks just like the one obtained in the random phase approximation of a fermi gas with the bare mass @xmath15 . the diverging effective mass may be expected to show up in the temperature dependence of the specific heat at low temperatures ; however , a contribution from the low frequency density relaxation collective mode could lead to the same anomalous temperature dependence as the quasiparticle contribution .    as noted by hlr",
    ", a more definitive manifestation of the diverging @xmath6 should come from the behavior of the energy gap at quantized hall steps for @xmath16 , for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , one might expect the energy gap @xmath17 to be @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the effective mass calculated self ",
    "consistently at an energy @xmath17 , and @xmath20 is the deviation of the magnetic field from its value at @xmath5 .",
    "here we denote the average density of electrons by @xmath21 , and we use units where @xmath22 . until now",
    ", however , the conjecture ( [ gapintro ] ) has not been checked by any explicit calculation .    in this paper",
    "we study both the even denominator state and the way it is approached when the filling fraction is slightly away from it .",
    "we study the properties of the fermi liquid formed at an even denominator filling fraction ( e.g. , @xmath23 ) , namely , the effective mass and the quasi  particle interaction function .",
    "we review the perturbative calculation leading to the divergence of the effective mass , and find that for the coulomb case , as @xmath9 , the leading term in the effective mass is , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background dielectric constant , @xmath7 is the distance from the fermi energy and the fermi wavevector @xmath26 is related to the electron density by @xmath27 .",
    "we then argue that eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) is the _ exact _ leading term in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "this statement is based on the use of ward s identity to account for the renormalization of the vertices in the diagram leading to the divergence of @xmath6 .",
    "we directly calculate the energy gap at a filling factor of the form @xmath28 , and confirm the conjecture ( [ gapintro ] ) .",
    "thus , for large @xmath1 , the energy gap we obtain is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnetic length .",
    "following our discussion of the effective mass , we argue that our expression for the energy gap , eq .",
    "( [ gapp ] ) , is _ exact _ in the @xmath31 limit @xcite . in our study of the landau quasi ",
    "particle interaction function at @xmath32 we find that it includes a singular contribution that is just of the form necessary to explain the results of kim _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , of the form needed to cancel the effect of a diverging effective mass on the zero temperature long wavelength low frequency linear response function .",
    "the expression we find for the landau quasi  particle interaction function is , however , not exact . in particular ,",
    "our approximation does not properly account for the effects of short wavelength and high frequency fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are particularly important in the limit where the electron s bare mass is vanishingly small , so that the cyclotron energy becomes infinite and the actual electron states are projected onto the lowest landau level ; our approximation incorrectly predicts the magnitude of the landau interaction function in this limit .",
    "the short wavelength and high frequency fluctuations are not important for the effective mass @xmath6 and the energy gaps at @xmath31 , because these quantities are determined by infra ",
    "red divergences in the self energy .    combining our analysis of the effective mass and the quasi  particle interaction function , we study the behavior of the chemical potential @xmath33 of the composite fermions as the density @xmath21 is varied and @xmath34 is kept fixed .",
    "we find that the chemical potential jumps discontinuously whenever the density corresponds to an integer fermionic filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of the jump is the energy gap corresponding to the fractional quantum hall state at @xmath35 . as emphasized above",
    ", it reflects the divergence of @xmath6 .",
    "however , we also find that the chemical potential varies continuously during the course of a population of a fermions landau level .",
    "this variation is such that the overall slope of @xmath36 is independent of the divergent contribution to @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "( [ mufig ] ) ) .    in our perturbative study of the fermion s effective mass , energy gaps and landau interaction function",
    ", we use the rpa expression for the gauge field propagator .",
    "this use is then justified by our results .",
    "the singularities we study result from the long wavelength low frequency behavior of the gauge propagator .",
    "the latter are determined by the long wavelength low frequency limit of the fermion s polarization functions ( the fermions irreducible polarization bubble ) .",
    "as we show , and as was shown before by several authors @xcite@xcite@xcite , in that limit , the fermions irreducible polarization functions are not renormalized by gauge field fluctuations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ( 2 ) we construct a general framework for the discussion of the fermi liquid formed by the composite fermions . in section ( 3 )",
    "we calculate perturbatively the parameters characterizing this fermi liquid , and we discuss the regime of validity of the perturbative approach . in section ( 4 )",
    "we examine the linear response function resulting from the parameters obtained in sec .",
    "( 3 ) . in section ( 5 ) we calculate the energy gaps for large @xmath1 , and analyze the dependence of the chemical potential on the density for fixed @xmath34 . in section ( 6 ) we comment on the effect of the coupling of the fermions to _ longitudinal _ gauge fluctuations .",
    "we conclude with a summary .",
    "several details of the analysis of section ( 3 ) are given in appendices a and b.",
    "in this section we define the model to be considered , and we give a general description of the fermi liquid formed at even denominator filling fractions . we consider electrons in a two dimensional electron gas , subject to a magnetic field @xmath37 .",

    "the constraint may be used to write the electrostatic term as @xmath46 v({\\bf r}-{\\bf r ' } ) [ { \\bf\\nabla}\\times{\\bf a}({\\bf r'})]$ ] .",
    "the fermion s interaction with the transverse gauge field is then of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the fermions current and density .",
    "the fermi wave - vector of the fermions is @xmath49 .    at the mean field approximation , the chern ",
    "simons gauge field @xmath50 is replaced by its average value , and thus its interaction with the fermions is neglected . in this section",
    "we attempt to describe the effect of these interactions on the fermions within an extension of landau s fermi liquid theory .",
    "landau s theory describes the low energy excitations of the system in terms of the occupation number function @xmath51 @xcite@xcite .",
    "this function signifies the _ difference _ between the occupation number of the state @xmath52 at the excited state and the corresponding number at the ground state .",
    "the energy density corresponding to a given function @xmath51 is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the kinetic energy of a quasi  particle near the fermi level , @xmath6 is its effective mass , and @xmath55 is the landau interaction function . note that in the presence of a non ",
    "zero vector potential , @xmath52 is the dynamical momentum , and not the canonical one .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 include the entire effect of the interaction near the fermi level in the case of a neutral fluid such as @xmath57 in its normal state , but they conventionally leave out the direct , hartree , part of the interaction in the case of electrons in a metal .",
    "the difference between the two cases is in the range of the interactions being short for helium atoms and long for electrons in metals .",
    "as developed in silin s extension of landau s theory @xcite , the effect of long range interactions is taken into account when linear response functions are calculated , by making a distinction between the externally applied driving force and total driving force . in the problem we consider , the chern ",
    "simons interaction of the fermions with the gauge field is long ranged .",
    "consequently , the direct hartree part of both that interaction and the electrostatic one should be separated from the rest .",
    "thus , our construction of the fermi liquid picture for the composite fermions starts by defining the energy functional ( [ landau ] ) excluding the contribution of the direct hartree part of both interactions .",
    "then , we use the equation of motion derived from that functional to define and calculate a linear response function of the fermions .",
    "the equation of motion is conveniently written as an integral equation for the function @xmath58 , defined by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the angle between @xmath52 and some reference direction @xcite@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath58 describes the deformation of the fermi surface in the direction @xmath60 .",

    "the difference between the functions @xmath85 and @xmath89 should be particularly stressed in the context of the compressibility .",

    "( [ sesc ] ) is identical to that obtained from ( [ sezero ] ) .",
    "consequently , so is the effective mass .",
    "as for the landau function , by using the relation between the bare mass , the effective mass and @xmath181 ( eq . ( [ fltwi ] ) ) , it is easy to see that @xmath181 is unaffected , too .",
    "the same can be shown for @xmath102 : when the self energy is approximated by the self consistent expression ( [ sesc ] ) , ward s identity requires the approximation of the interaction operator by a sum of ladder diagrams ( see fig .",

    "( [ ftheta ] ) .",
    "we carry out this calculation in appendix b.    a further improvement of the approximation ( [ sezero ] ) for the self energy might , in principle , be achieved by replacing the interaction vertices by dressed ones . as far as the effective mass is concerned , this replacement may lead to a modification of the logarithmic singularity in the limit @xmath9 , to a modification of the prefactor of the logarithm or to no modification of this singularity .",
    "we now argue that the last is true , i.e. , that _ the effective mass ( [ meff ] ) is exact in the limit @xmath9 . _",
    "the essence of our argument is the observation , discussed below eq .",
    "( [ sigexp ] ) , that for a state with an energy @xmath7 close to the fermi level , the contributions to the self energy come from small energy transfers @xmath141 , but from a wide range of momentum transfers @xmath183 , where @xmath184 .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the effective mass is a result of the long wavelength contribution , of order of @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the interaction vertex of significance is that in which both the momentum @xmath135 and the energy @xmath7 transferred to the gauge field approach zero , with the ratio @xmath186 .    as a first step in our argument , consider separating the gauge field propagator @xmath126 into long wavelengths ( small @xmath135 ) and short wavelengths ( large @xmath135 ) parts .",
    "the divergence of the effective mass results from the long wavelength part .",
    "now , imagine repeating the calculation of the self energy leading to eq .",
    "( [ sezero ] ) or ( [ sesc ] ) , but with the fermions green s functions , the gauge field propagator and the interaction vertices renormalized by the short wavelength gauge fluctuations .",
    "moreover , imagine that this renormalization is done exactly , i.e. , that @xmath169 , @xmath126 and the vertices are dressed by all possible lines of short wavelengths interactions ( see fig .",
    "( [ vertexfig ] ) for some low order contributions for the dressing of the vertex ) . what would be the effect of this renormalization on the logarithmic singularity in the self energy ?",
    "let us see how it affects each of the ingredients of the diagram in fig .",
    "( [ vertexfig ] ) .",
    "first , consider the fermion s green s function .",
    "the interaction of the fermions with the short wavelength gauge fluctuation induces a regular self energy in the fermions green function .",
    "we denote that self energy by @xmath187 .",
    "second , consider the vertices .",
    "the self energy @xmath188 determines not only the renormalization of the green s function , but also that of the vertices .",
    "the latter is determined by a ward identity : in the limit @xmath189 , the interaction vertex is multiplied by @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "lastly , the gauge field propagator is not likely to be renormalized by the short wavelength gauge fluctuations : it is determined by the electron density and the electron s charge , none of which is subject to renormalization .",
    "armed with these observations , we may now calculate the self energy due to the long wavelengths fluctuations , with the short wavelengths fluctuations taken into account exactly .",
    "the diagrams in fig .",
    "( [ sigmafig ] ) include two vertices , and each is multiplied by @xmath190 .",
    "the integral over the magnitude of the internal momentum vector yields a factor of @xmath191 .",
    "thus , altogether , the short wavelengths fluctuations multiply the self energy ( [ sigexp ] ) , which we denote by @xmath192 , by @xmath190 . the effective mass then becomes , @xmath193 at sufficiently low frequencies , however , @xmath194 , and @xmath6 is independent of @xmath195 , i.e. , the diverging part of the effective mass is not affected by the short wavelength gauge fluctuations .",
    "we conclude , then , that the diagram leading to the divergence of the effective mass through a small energy  momentum exchange with the gauge field is not renormalized by large energy ",
    "momentum exchange .",
    "this conclusion suggests that our expression for the diverging part of the effective mass ( [ meff ] ) is _ exact _ in the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "does our method take into account all diagrams contributing to the leading divergence in the self energy ? given a self energy diagram , in our method we single out the gauge field propagator with the smallest momentum , @xmath196 ( denoted by the dashed line in fig .",
    "( [ vertexfig ] ) ) , and assume that all the momenta carried by the other gauge field propagators ( denoted by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "( [ vertexfig ] ) ) are much larger .",
    "we thus effectively exclude the portions of phase space where two or more wave - vectors are close to @xmath196 .",
    "this exclusion should not affect the coefficient of the divergent portion of @xmath197 if the self energy has contributions from a large range of momentum exchange .",
    "this is indeed the case for a coulomb interaction , where the divergence is only logarithmic , and the momentum exchange goes up to @xmath198 .",
    "the separation of wave - vector scales leading to eq .",
    "( [ vertexmass ] ) is therefore specific to the case of coulomb interactions .",
    "the separation of length scales we use is in the spirit of a renormalization group analysis , which has been explicitly introduced by nayak and wilczek , and justified in the coulomb case @xcite@xcite .",
    "nayak and wilczek have also obtained a logarithmic singularity in the scaling of the frequency @xmath199 @xmath200 for the fermion propagator , but they have not discussed the value of the coefficient or consequences for fermi liquid theory @xcite .    the situation with the landau interaction function @xmath107 is considerably more complicated than that for the effective mass . due to the identity ( [ fltwi ] ) ,",
    "if @xmath6 diverges at the fermi level we must have @xmath201 .",
    "the other interaction parameters will be renormalized by the short wavelength gauge fluctuations , which are not treated correctly in our approximation .",
    "thus , we are not able to make precise predictions for their behavior . in the limit where the bare mass @xmath15 is small , so that the cyclotron frequency is large compared to the scale of electron ",
    "electron interaction , we expect the ground state and low  energy excitations to be confined to the _ electronic _ lowest landau level .",
    "therefore , one might expect the energy cost of small deformations of the composite fermions fermi surface , eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) , to be determined only by electron ",
    "electron interactions , and to be independent of the cyclotron energy , i.e. , of @xmath15 .",
    "in actuality , we see two exceptions to that rule .",
    "the first is a galilean boost of the fermi surface ( e.g. , @xmath202 ) . in that case",
    "the energy cost is determined by @xmath181 , which is , indeed , @xmath15dependent .",
    "the second is @xmath203 , a uniform expansion of the fermi surface . in that case",
    "the energy cost is determined by @xmath170 , which is related to the composite fermions compressibility . as discussed in section ( 2 ) , the latter depends on the bare mass even when @xmath204 .",
    "consequently , we find that in the limit of @xmath204 the first two landau parameters , @xmath170 and @xmath181 , should have a value of the order of @xmath205 .",
    "we believe , however , that for @xmath206 , the value of @xmath207 is determined by the energy scale of electron  electron interaction .",
    "we also believe that @xmath208 , so that @xmath102 should include a delta function component , whose amplitude is determined by electron  electron interactions . at this stage , however , we are not able to substantiate this argument by a detailed calculation .    in view of our caveats regarding the perturbative calculation of the landau function , one may ask is there a parameter whose smallness could make our approximations for @xmath143 and @xmath160 close to their exact values .",
    "this question is not easy to answer , since our results do not constitute the first few terms in a power expansion in a small parameter  the use of an rpa gauge field propagator involves a summation of all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "a small parameter in the sense defined above might be a parameter whose smallness makes the self energy ( [ sigexp ] ) small .",
    "an obvious candidate is @xmath2 since @xmath209 .",
    "however , our results do not become exact when @xmath210 . at @xmath210 the magnetic field @xmath211 , and",
    "the problem is that of interacting electrons in the absence of a magnetic field . in the latter , which is of course a well studied problem , the electron ",
    "electron interaction gives rise to a wave  vector dependent self energy , which renormalizes the mass , in contrary to the vanishing self energy in our calculation for @xmath210 .",
    "consequently , our unperturbed problem could not be that of @xmath210 and finite @xmath212 , and has to be that of non  interacting electron at zero magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath213 .",
    "our perturbative analysis should therefore apply to the limit where both @xmath214 and @xmath215 . for the self energy ( [ sigexp ] ) to be small , thus making the perturbative treatment sensible , the ratio between these two parameters should satisfy @xmath216 . in view of that , the approximation we have obtained for the landau function can be better understood . at any finite non ",
    "integer @xmath2 , the problem we deal with is that of anyons in a magnetic field . due to the anyonic statistics , the ground state of that problem",
    "is not confined to the lowest landau level even as @xmath204@xcite .",
    "thus , the bare mass affects the landau function of the transformed fermions .",
    "it is only at the particular values of integer @xmath2 that when @xmath204 the ground state is purely composed of lowest landau level wave functions .",
    "our perturbative treatment of the landau function is not good enough to capture that feature .",
    "an alternative procedure which has been used to investigate a related problem of particles interacting with a gauge field is to introduce @xmath217 species of fermions , and to analyze the problem in the limit of large @xmath217 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the rpa gauge field propagator in this model is identical to our @xmath129 , and the interaction with the gauge field induces a current  current interaction between the fermions .",
    "the leading term in the large @xmath217 limit of that model are similar to the ones included in our self  consistent green s function approximation .",
    "this large @xmath217 procedure has not been applied directly to the chern ",
    "simons problem discussed here , however .    in conclusion",
    ", our perturbative calculation indicates that the effective mass of the composite fermions diverges logarithmically , according to eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , as the fermi surface is approached , while the landau function approaches a delta function in @xmath60 .",
    "we believe that the former is an exact statement , while the latter is only approximate . in the next two sections we study possible consequences of these singularities on observable quantities .",
    "having derived approximate values for the effective mass and the landau function , we now turn to analyze the fermions collective modes , and their linear response to a driving force .",
    "the collective modes we refer to here are the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eomnu ] ) with @xmath218 , i.e. , they are fictitious modes which would occur if the hartree interaction were removed . as explained in section ( 2 ) ,",
    "some of these modes are unaffected by the inclusion of the hartree term .",
    "generally , in the absence of a driving force equation ( [ eomnu ] ) has a continuum of solutions for which @xmath219 , and might have a discrete spectrum of solutions for which @xmath220 . for any particular landau function ,",
    "the number of modes in the discrete part of the spectrum is smaller or equal to the number of non  zero landau parameters . within the framework used in the previous section",
    "we have found that the landau function of the composite fermions is @xmath221 , i.e. , its landau parameters are all non  zero and equal .",
    "the effect of this particular landau function turns out to be a trivial one : consider the slightly more general case of @xmath222 . substituting this landau function in eq .",
    "( [ eomnu ] ) we find that its only effect is to shift the fermi velocity from @xmath223 to @xmath224 .",
    "galilean invariance , however , relates @xmath107 and @xmath6 and requires @xmath225 @xcite .",
    "thus , we find that the only effect of any delta function @xmath102 is to cancel the renormalization of the fermi velocity and shift it back to its bare value . in the particular case",
    "we consider , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the landau function shifts the mass back from infinity to its bare value .",
    "the effective mass @xmath6 then cancels from eq .",
    "( [ eomnu ] ) , and , consequently , it does not affect the long wavelength low frequency behavior of linear response function .",
    "this result is of course consistent with the analyses of kim _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite and altshuler _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite for the response functions .",
    "the above results could be viewed as a limiting case of the behavior of the discrete spectrum when the number of appreciably non ",
    "zero landau parameters is very large : the larger this number is , the larger is the number of modes at the range @xmath220 , and the fuzzier is the distinction between the continuum and the discrete spectra .",
    "when all landau parameters are appreciably non ",
    "zero , the number of modes at @xmath228 becomes infinite , and the discrete spectrum may become continuous .",
    "our use of the equation of motion ( [ eomnu ] ) for a case in which the effective mass diverges at the fermi level might be too crude an approximation .",
    "one may expect a more careful analysis to introduce a frequency dependence to @xmath6 and @xmath107 in that equation , as presented in eq .",
    "( [ ftheta ] ) .",
    "however , at low frequencies , the main feature we stressed here should not change .",
    "the landau function has many appreciably non ",
    "zero landau parameters , and thus the number of discrete collective modes is very large . at finite temperature or finite wavelengths these modes acquire a width , due to quasi  particle scattering , and the discrete spectrum becomes more of a continuum .",
    "we have seen that the singularities of @xmath6 and @xmath107 mutually cancel in even denominator @xmath229 linear response functions at zero temperature .",
    "this might cast some doubt on the physical significance of the divergence of the effective mass .",
    "are there any observable quantities in which this divergence is manifested ? the next section is devoted to the study of one such manifestation , in the variation of the chemical potential with the density at and between fractional quantum hall states .",
    "we now turn to consider the case of a large , yet finite , @xmath1 , i.e. , electrons at fractional quantized hall states close to @xmath4 .",
    "the question to be discussed is the variation of the transformed fermions chemical potential @xmath33 as a function of the density @xmath96 . for non ",
    "interacting electrons in a constant magnetic field , the chemical potential jumps discontinuously when the density is varied .",
    "the jumps take place at integer filling factors , and their height , @xmath230 , is the energy gap for the integer quantized hall effect states . for the problem we consider ,",
    "care should be taken in defining an analogous question , since the density can be varied with the external magnetic field @xmath37 being kept fixed , or with the effective magnetic field @xmath34 being kept fixed .",
    "the different significance of the two quantities deserves further elaboration .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath33 is the energy cost involved in adding a transformed fermion to the system ( along with a compensating contribution to the charge of the uniform positive background ) , while @xmath34 is held fixed .",
    "this chemical potential should be distinguished from the chemical potential @xmath231 for electrons , defined as the change in the ground state energy when one electron is added to the system and the external field @xmath37 is held fixed .",
    "since the total number of transformed fermions equals the total number of electrons @xmath232 , we can simply write , @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the system s ground state energy .    suppose that a fermion is added to the ground state at @xmath35 , by use of the transformed fermion creation operator @xmath235 , and suppose that the resulting wavefunction is projected onto the lowest available energy state .",
    "the added fermion carries a flux tube of @xmath2 flux quanta , in a direction opposite to the external field @xmath37 .",
    "if the latter is kept constant , this flux tube is uncompensated and the total flux becomes smaller by @xmath2 flux quanta .",
    "thus , @xmath2 fermions are pushed out of any one of the @xmath1 occupied landau levels , and the @xmath236th level receives a total of @xmath237 fermions . if , however , it is @xmath34 that is kept constant , the @xmath2 flux tubes carried by the fermion are compensated by a change in @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , the total flux does not change , and only one fermion resides in the @xmath236 landau level . in that case , the resulting state has a fractional charge @xmath238 in the vicinity of the point @xmath239 , where @xmath240 , while the remaining charge @xmath241 is pushed to the boundary of the system ; i.e. , a quasi  particle is added to the interior of the system .",
    "it follows from this analysis that the energy gap @xmath17 , defined as the energy to add one quasi  particle and one quasi ",
    "hole ( well separated from each other ) to the ground state at @xmath35 , may be identified with a discontinuity in the fermion chemical potential @xmath33 at filling factor @xmath242 .",
    "our approach in studying @xmath243 for a fixed @xmath34 is based on a perturbative calculation of the energy cost involved in adding one fermion to the system in three different situations : ( _ a _ ) when @xmath244 levels are completely filled , and the added fermion is the first one in the @xmath1th level ; ( _ b _ ) when the @xmath1th level is almost filled , and the added fermion occupies the last vacant state on that level ; ( _ c _ ) when @xmath1 levels are completely filled and the added fermion is the first one in the @xmath236th level .",
    "the three are denoted @xmath245 , respectively .",
    "obviously , @xmath246 .",
    "in the absence of the perturbation , for any given @xmath1 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 . in the presence of the perturbation the jump in the chemical potential , @xmath249 , will be denoted by @xmath250 .",
    "our calculation of the three chemical potential differences is based on a perturbative study of the fermion propagator , defined in eq .",

    "one comment regarding the exact propagator is in place before we turn to perturbation theory . since @xmath251 ,",

    "it is diagonal in landau level representation_.    the fermion propagator in landau level representation is defined by @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the wavefunction for the state with angular momentum @xmath15 and landau level index @xmath96 , and a symmetric gauge is used .",
    "as we now turn to show , @xmath254 is non  zero only for @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "the argument for that is based on a spherical geometry @xcite . as discussed by haldane",
    ", the problem of electrons in a magnetic field on a plane can be studied by using a spherical geometry and taking the limit of an infinite sphere .",
    "similar to the plane , the single particle eigenstates of electrons on a sphere , subject to a magnetic field perpendicular to the sphere , are classified to energy ",
    "degenerate landau levels .",
    "unlike the plane , all states in the @xmath96th landau level are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator @xmath257 , with the eigenvalue @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the number of flux quanta threading the sphere .",
    "states within a landau level can be taken to be eigenstates of @xmath260 , the @xmath153component of the angular momentum , with integer eigenvalues ranging between @xmath261 to @xmath262 .",
    "the spherical analog to a translationally invariant state is a state of zero total angular momentum . as usual",

    "both states are eigenstates of the angular momentum operators @xmath257 and @xmath260 .",

    "again , we find that corrections to the vertices are cancelled by corrections to the intermediate fermion green s function and by the factor @xmath332 neglected in eq .",

    "thus , we find that eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) remains exact in the limit @xmath31 . due to the similarity with the analysis presented in section ( 3c ) , we omit the details here .    to conclude this section ,",
    "we make one more comment regarding the energy gap .",
    "our calculation of the fqhe energy gaps is based on the study of poles of a single fermion green s function . an alternative way to extract",
    "the energy gap @xmath250 is through the linear response functions @xmath85 and @xmath89 at an integer fermion s filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "as illustrated by an rpa calculation @xcite and a modified rpa calculation @xcite , in the _ large wave - vector _ limit , @xmath333 , the lowest poles of both @xmath85 and @xmath89 occur at a frequency that equals the energy gap .",
    "these poles describe the excitation of a well separated quasi ",
    "hole quasi  particle pair .",
    "the modified rpa calculation employs an approximation in which only one landau parameter , @xmath181 , is non  zero , and shows that while at the large wave - vector limit the excitation energies are unaffected by the landau parameter , this is not the case for small values of @xmath135 . in the latter case the quasi  particle and quasi",
    "hole are not well separated , and their mutual interaction affects the energy of the excitation .",
    "as has been noted above , the logarithmic divergence of @xmath334 , arising from interactions with the gauge field , implies that the weight @xmath335 of the quasi  particle contribution to the fermion green s function @xmath169 is proportional to @xmath336 when @xmath337 , and vanishes at the fermi surface .",
    "however , as originally noted by hlr , there is another effect which causes @xmath169 to vanish for any value of @xmath242 , for any momentum and any finite energy , in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "this effect arises from of the coupling of the fermion propagator to the longitudinal gauge propagator @xmath128 , which thus far has been neglected in our discussion .",
    "the physical reason for this divergence is that the transformed fermion operator @xmath235 has the effect of adding an electron at point @xmath239 , and instantaneously turning on a solenoid containing two flux quanta .",
    "the impulse electric field generated by the solenoid produces inter landau level excitations at large distances from @xmath239 ( i.e. , it produces long  wavelength magnetoplasma excitations at the cyclotron frequency @xmath338 ) whose mean number diverges logarithmically with the size of the system .",
    "the probability that the many electron state has remained entirely in the lowest landau level ( or in any other state with only a finite number of cyclotron excitations ) is therefore found to vanish as a power of the size of the system @xcite .    in order to have a non vanishing weight for the one fermion green s function at low energies , it is necessary to define a renormalized version of the green function .",
    "one possibility would be to carry out calculations for a large but finite system , and to renormalize the overall weight by a size  dependent factor before taking the limit of infinite size .",
    "an alternative approach is to work in an infinite system in the limit where all operators are projected onto the lowest landau level _ of the electrons_. this is equivalent to taking the limit where the bare mass @xmath204 ( i.e. , @xmath339 ) , while the electron ",
    "electron interaction is held constant .",
    "simultaneously , the flux in the solenoid associated with @xmath235 should be turned on at a rate slow compared with @xmath338 but fast compared to the scale of the electron ",
    "electron interaction .",
    "although neither of these procedures has been carried out in detail , we expect that the renormalized fermion green s function should indeed have the low energy properties obtained for @xmath169 in the previous sections , where the coupling to @xmath128 was neglected .",
    "in particular , the renormalized green function should have a singularity at @xmath340 , whose weight vanishes as @xmath341 .",
    "there is no indication that the coupling to @xmath128 would change the singular behavior of the quasi  particle dispersion for @xmath337 , or of the energy gaps at @xmath35 .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we discussed the effect of the diverging long wavelength low frequency fluctuations of the chern  simons gauge field on the properties of the electronic state at and near @xmath5 .    in sec .",
    "( 2 ) we constructed an extension of fermi liquid theory designed to describe the effect of the chern ",
    "simons fluctuations on the low energy excitations of the composite fermions .",
    "we emphasized the separation between the hartree and non  hartree part of the interaction .",
    "in sec ( 3 ) we derived approximate expressions for the fermi liquid parameters , namely the fermions effective mass and the landau function .",
    "we showed that at @xmath5 both behave singularly .",
    "the effective mass diverges as the fermi surface is approached , and the landau function has a part that approaches a delta function at @xmath175 .",
    "we argued that our approximation for the effective mass becomes exact in the limit @xmath9 .    in section ( 4 )",
    "we showed that at @xmath41 the singularities in @xmath6 and @xmath102 are cancelled in the linear response functions in the limit of low frequencies and long wavelengths .    in sec .",
    "( 5 ) we investigated the variation of the chemical potential of the transformed fermions when the density is varied and @xmath34 is kept fixed .",
    "we showed that within our perturbative treatment , the energy gap of the fractional hall states depends singularly on the filling factor , but the overall slope of @xmath243 is not subject to that singularity .    finally , in sec .",
    "( 6 ) we briefly reviewed the effect of the fermions coupling to longitudinal gauge field fluctuations on their green s function .",
    "we argued that this coupling does not affect the results obtained in the previous sections .    even within the limited context of clean systems ,",
    "to which we have constrained ourselves in this paper , we left several important questions opened .",
    "we would like to point out some of these .",
    "first , while we believe our approximation for the effective mass of the fermions becomes exact at a certain limit , we do not have a similar understanding of our approximation for the landau function .",
    "we consider it likely that our approximation for the landau function yields the correct type of singularity ( a delta function ) , but with an incorrect coefficient .",
    "second , the analysis of this paper has been explicitly confined to the case of coulomb interactions between the electrons ( i.e. , an interaction that behaves as @xmath342 at large separations . extensions to a shorter range interaction would be of considerable theoretical interest , but must be carried out with care .",
    "perhaps most importantly , care should be exercised in discussing the very notions of an effective mass and fermi liquid parameters , since the decay rate of the quasiparticle might be comparable to its energy ( in contrast to the coulomb interaction , where the real part of the energy is larger than the imaginary part by a factor of @xmath343 , a factor that diverges as the fermi surface is approached ) .",
    "finally , it should also be noted that in most practical applications to present experiments on electron systems in partially filled landau level , the logarithmic contribution to the fqhe energy gap is smaller than the finite , non  singular , contributions arising from short wavelength fluctuations in the gauge field , which we were not able to calculate reliably .",
    "these contributions depend on the behavior of the electron ",
    "electron interaction at short distances , and are therefore `` non  universal '' .",

    "( [ fzero ] ) we see that the approximate value for the effective mass used in eq .",
    "( [ fefes ] ) to determine the landau function should be the same as the one used in the identity ( [ goal ] ) .",
    "moreover , we get to the following prescription for establishing an approximation for @xmath6 and @xmath107 that respects the fermi liquid identities ( [ fltwi ] ) :    *   the first step is to choose an approximation for the green s function @xmath169 , the interaction operator @xmath160 and the self energy @xmath143 in such a way that the ward identities ( [ ward ] ) and ( [ wardmu ] ) are satisfied . *   at the second step , the approximate value for @xmath143 should be used to extract an approximation for the effective mass . *",
    "finally , the approximate values for the effective mass , the interaction operator and the green s function should be substituted in eq .",
    "( [ fgammab ] ) , to obtain an approximate value for the landau function .",
    "the application of this prescription to the first  order  in@xmath126 approximation we have used in section ( 3 ) is straightforward . as we discussed in section ( 3 )",

    "( [ ward ] ) , we find that for ward s identity to be satisfied , the interaction operator should be approximated by the sum of ladder diagrams , illustrated in fig ( [ vertexfig ] ) .",
    "ward s identity requires @xmath349 . since the left hand side of the identity is unchanged when the first  order ",

    "for this equation to be consistent with our @xmath153power counting , the second term of the right hand side should be of the same order of @xmath153 as @xmath167 .",
