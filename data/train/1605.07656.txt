    "nevertheless , two prominent theoretical frameworks for modelling frequency - dependent evolutionary processes neglect ecological changes : ( i ) the deterministic replicator dynamics @xcite assumes infinite population sizes and tracks only relative abundances of strategies and ( ii ) the stochastic dynamics of the ( frequency dependent ) moran process @xcite assumes that the population size is fixed .",
    "implicitly this assumes that the carrying capacity is independent of the type and abundance of strategies . for a complete understanding of evolutionary processes it is therefore important to incorporate ecological changes .",

    "as group sizes increase , so do intuitively the possibilities for social conflict . however , the reasons for forming groups may qualitatively change the outcome . for example , defending a resource against a common intruder can reduce social conflict even if group sizes increase@xcite .",

    "including spatial dimensions either explicitly through unoccupied sites @xcite or implicitly by limiting reproductive opportunities @xcite effectively reduces the interaction group size and shows interesting parallels to voluntary public goods games @xcite .",

    "synergy and discounting generate non - linearities in the rate of return of the pg and hence reflect diminishing returns or economies of scale , which are common features of group interactions in biological and social systems @xcite .",
    "for example , in cooperative breeding cichlid fish the optimum breeding group size changes depending on the perceived environmental threats as compared to the potential benefits an additional member could provide to the group @xcite .",

    "moreover , it might be possible to actively deter the predator , which would be impossible alone .",
    "however , larger group sizes also imply larger visibility and higher encounter rates with predators @xcite .",

    "the initial configuration and initial phase of environmental oscillations only affects the time and trajectories leading to extinction .",
    "effects of ecological variation based on intrinsic or extrinsic sources can alter the fitness landscape or , similarly , pleiotropy between traits can change the effective selection pressure observed on a single trait @xcite",
