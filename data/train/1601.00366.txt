    "the surface tension @xmath3 is an interesting mechanical quantity for biological membranes @xcite , and therefore a lot of theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted @xcite .",
    "one of the problems is to find whether @xmath3 depends on the true ( or microscopic ) surface area @xmath4 or the projected area @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this problem comes from the fact that @xmath4 reflects the surface fluctuations , and hence the thermal fluctuations are expected to influence @xmath3 through the change of @xmath4 . at present , it is commonly understood that @xmath3 does not depend on the microscopic area @xmath4 and depends on the projected area @xmath5 of the surface boundary @xcite .    however , we still have another interesting question that should be asked .",
    "the problem is whether @xmath3 depends on the shape of the boundary @xmath6 or not .",
    "indeed , @xmath3 is influenced by the surface fluctuations , and the surface fluctuations are strongly dependent on the boundary conditions including the shape of @xmath6 in general .",
    "thus , it is possible that the surface tensions of the two surfaces of different boundary are different from each other .",
    "if this is true , @xmath3 becomes dependent not only on the projected area @xmath5 but also on the boundary shape , and as a consequence , this leads to serious confusion for experimental measurements of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study whether @xmath3 depends on the shape of @xmath6 or not .",
    "this problem has not yet been studied rigorously or numerically .",
    "we should comment on the problem of the crumpling transition and its influence on the surface tension @xmath3 .",
    "this is deeply connected with the interesting phenomenon : if a transition is of second order in a spin model for example , the correlation length is divergent , and hence the spins at the boundary influence the phase structure .",
    "therefore , we also expect , in the case of the surface model , that the boundary condition such as those assumed for the surface tension calculation influences @xmath3 . however , we know from our experience that the phase transition disappears due to the fixed boundary @xmath6 at least in the canonical model of helfrich and polyakov @xcite .",
    "moreover , neither the crumpling transition nor the other morphology such as the branched polymer is seen on the fixed boundary surfaces .",
    "this is one of the motivations of our study on the surface tension without the boundaries in @xcite .    to be accurate , the surface shape of the model ( in @xmath7 ) is almost fixed by @xmath6 in the simulations for the calculation of @xmath3",
    "indeed , the phase structure of the discrete hp model for example is determined by the direction of the normal vectors of the triangles and the positions of the triangles .",
    "we should also remember that the position of every triangle is almost fixed or strongly influenced by @xmath6 .",
    "thus , it should be remarked that the surface model with @xmath6 is in sharp contrast to the spin model with the boundary condition .",
    "therefore in this paper , we do not go into detail on the problem how the shape of @xmath6 influences @xmath3 at the crumpling transition point ; no crumpling transition is expected at least in the canonical model .    in this paper , we study whether the surface tension @xmath3 is independent of the shape of @xmath6 , by performing the metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite on relatively large lattices .",
    "we use two types of surfaces of the same projected area @xmath5 with different boundary shape .",

    "we should note that @xmath12 equals the applied external force to maintain the projected area @xmath5 , where @xmath13 is the lattice spacing or more precisely the edge length of the regular triangle ( see the triangle in fig . [ fig-1](c ) ) .",
    "we should note that the actual value of @xmath13 is not meaningful here to define the model , and the only meaningful quantity is the numbers such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for this reason , @xmath13 is fixed to be @xmath14 temporarily , and the actual side length of the cylinder is identified with the number @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) , and moreover the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath15 is neglected hence force . note also that the height @xmath0 of the cylinder is automatically fixed by fixing @xmath1 ( or the radius ) , because the projected area @xmath5 , which is identified with @xmath16 , is fixed throughout the simulations .",

    "this confirms that the surface tension does not depend on the shape of surface boundary at least on the surfaces without a continuous transition .",
    "as we have described in the introduction , the problem on the influence of the boundary shape on the surface tension @xmath3 at the crumpling transition point is out of the scope of this paper , because the transition is not always expected on the surface due to the existence of the fixed boundary @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , such a strong influence of @xmath6 on the phase transition is suspected in the canonical model , because in this model the surface normal vector @xmath112 is strongly influenced by @xmath6 . nevertheless , it seems possible that the first order transition observed on the surface without @xmath6 remains as a continuous one if the area of @xmath6 is much smaller than the area of the surface spanning @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , in another model such as the intrinsic curvature model for example @xcite , the influence of @xmath6 on the transition is not so strong because the intrinsic curvature is originally independent of the surface shape , and the transition does not completely disappear and remains as a continuous one .",
    "therefore , in those models , the influence of @xmath6 is expected to be more clear at @xmath35 close to the transition point @xmath113 , because the correlation length becomes larger and larger if @xmath114 .",
    "thus , if the influence of the shape of @xmath6 on @xmath3 is observed , it should be understood as a signal of the continuous transition .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the dependence of @xmath3 on the shape of @xmath6 at @xmath113 in those models .",
