    "the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) observed in graphene few years ago@xcite presents significant differences compared to the qhe in usual two - dimensional electron gases . due to the unique features of the dirac - like band structure of graphene around fermi energy ,",
    "the sequence of plateaus is shifted by half - integer if compared to the usual qhe , and the energy dependence of the landau levels ( lls ) with magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) is not linear anymore , but goes with root square of ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "another important difference is that , in addition to the spin degree of freedom , graphene lls exhibit a valley degree of freedom , which has been the subject of many interesting studies and application proposals@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the effects of considering disorder and vacancies on the electronic properties of graphene in the presence of @xmath0 , reviewing and expanding the discussions of recent results on these subjects @xcite .",
    "we calculate energy spectra as a function of magnetic field , density of states ( dos ) and localization properties of the states within the graphene lls .",
    "the tight - binding lattice model used is described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we analyse the role of vacancies in the lattice , focusing on the evolution with @xmath0 of the localized states introduced in the dos by the vacancies , and on the interesting consequences of considering an increasing density of vacancies@xcite . in section 4",

    "the non - interacting hamiltonian model is the following :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the fermionic operator on site @xmath3 . a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 is included by means of a peierls substitution in hopping parameter ( @xmath4@xmath52.7ev for graphene ) : @xmath6 . in the landau gauge , @xmath7 along the @xmath8 direction and @xmath9 along the @xmath10 direction , with @xmath11 ( @xmath12=2.46 is the lattice constant for graphene ) .",
    "square or rectangular graphene lattices are considered , of up to 8.000 atomic sites , which are repeated by means of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the electronic spectrum as a function of magnetic flux obtained for the honeycomb lattice is depicted in fig .",
    "we focus on the low - flux limit with energy window around the dirac point ( identified by the rectangular area ) , where the lls are well defined .    for the sake of landau bands broadening in the dos calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we consider disorder through on - site white - noise fluctuations , by sorting uncorrelated orbital energies within @xmath13 . when simulating vacancies , the hopping parameters around the vacancy are set to zero and the on - site energy at the vacancy site is made equal to a large value outside the energy range of the dos .",
    "atomic relaxation and rebounding around the monovacancies simulated are not considered , however , these effects are not expected to modify qualitatively the results we discuss@xcite .",
    "the localization properties of the states within the lls are inspected by means of the participation ratio ( pr)@xcite ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the amplitude of the normalized wave function on site @xmath3 , and @xmath16 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "the pr gives the proportion of @xmath16 sites over which the wave function is spread . in this way , the pr for a localized state will tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we consider vacancies in graphene lattices in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "previous to our work@xcite , the effects of vacancies on graphene have been studied mainly in situations in the absence of magnetic field@xcite and results on the graphene electronic structure modifications due to vacancies in the quantum hall regime were sparse@xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 that vacancies give origin to new states ( open circles ) which appear between consecutive the lls in the energy spectra .",
    "the energies of these vacancy states are increased with increasing magnetic fields .",
    "if two single vacancies are introduced in the lattice far away from each other , two degenerated states are introduced between lls at the same energy positions shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) for a single vacancy .",
    "however , a different scenario emerges if the two vacancies are introduced close to each other as revealed by the energy splitting observed on the energy - magnetic - flux spectra shown in figs .",

    "continuum lines show the energy dependencies with @xmath23 of the @xmath24=0,@xmath251,@xmath252 graphene lls , for guidance .",

    "strikingly , the pr for a vacancy concentration of @xmath32 shows a strong modulation for the vacancy related band , similar to the ones for the landau bands .",
    "this behavior signalizes the existence of new delocalized states in the dos . in this way",
    ", a vacancy lattice could be identified in magnetotransport measurement by extra quantum hall plateaus in between the original plateaus .",

    "3 , all the vacancies were introduced in the same sublattice . however , we emphasize that we also tested configurations ( not shown here ) where the vacancies are equally distributed between the two sublattices ( zero degree of uncompensation ) , and exactly the same effect seen in fig . 3",
    "is observed , i.e. , after a critical concentration , the pr clearly indicates a delocalization of the states in the middle of the vacancy - band .",
    "including disorder in the graphene lattice through random diagonal disorder models ( white - noise and gaussian - correlated disorder ) , we observed that anomalous localization properties occur in the zero - energy ll , where increasing disorder enhance the participation ratio of the states , instead of inducing the expected wave function localization@xcite .",
    "we found that this effect is related to the fact that in the absence of disorder ( ideal graphene ) , all the states within the lowest ll are sublattice polarized , i.e. , their wave functions have non - zero amplitudes in only one of the sublattices .",
    "here we expand the discussion from our previous work@xcite , showing in more details how the inclusion of disorder destroys the sublattice polarization in the @xmath24=0 ll .",
    "figure 4 summarizes our main results , showing the evolution of the dos , the participation ratio ( pr ) and the sublattice polarization around the dirac point , for increasing disorder in the white - noise disorder model . from the dos , one can see the lowest three lls ( @xmath24=0,1,2 ) and their increasing broadening with the disorder .",

    "wave function normalization implies @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to notice that this defined sublattice polarization gives the difference in modulus of the contribution from each sublattice to the total probability density of the state . in this way , polarization=0 in fig 4 means that the state is equally distributed on both sublattices , while polarization=1.0 means that the state has amplitudes over only one of the sublattices . in fig.4",
