    "the presence of macroscopic particles ( macroparticles ,  dust `` ) significantly modifies plasma properties @xcite , with visualization of kinetic effects of collective plasma dynamics @xcite . for example , the  charging '' damping appears due to plasma currents on dust particles @xcite thus affecting propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in such complex plasmas @xcite .",
    "most of previous studies were focused on the effects of the presence of charged dust particles on plasma collective phenomena . here , we demonstrate that another effect , namely , resonances with surface oscillations ( surface plasmons ) on macroparticle surfaces , can have important consequences on electromagnetic wave propagation in complex dusty plasmas .",
    "surface waves appearing on interfaces of two media with opposite signs of permittivities have long history of research @xcite .",
    "surface plasma waves ( sometimes called surface plasmons or surface plasmon polaritons ) , when one of the media is plasma , attracted special interest for many applications , for example , in plasmonics @xcite , for light sources in such schemes as spasers @xcite , as well as for other applications such as nano - antennas , etc . @xcite .",
    "the surface waves can transmit information on the properties of adjacent media , and therefore open a channel to influence electromagnetic properties in one of them by properties of another one @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate electromagnetic wave propagation in a plasma containing identical spherical macroparticles ( dust ) .",
    "two particular examples are considered in more details  first , metallic dust , and second , dielectric dust particles .",
    "we simplify the problem by excluding effects of space dispersion ( and therefore all related plasma phenomena such as debye screening , sheath formation near the macroparticle surfaces , particle charging phenomena , etc . ) but by keeping temporal dispersion . to calculate the effective permittivity of such a complex plasma",
    ", we employ the maxwell garnett ( mg ) approximation @xcite , known for over a century and widely used in studies of two - component mixtures , considered as host medium and inclusions @xcite .",
    "the mg approximation involves exact calculation of the electromagnetic field induced in the host medium by a single spherical inclusion ( in our case - spherical dust particle ) and an approximate consideration of the electrostatic interaction between the inclusions ( dust particles ) . in the lowest approximation ( corresponding to the longest range interactions ) , the associate distortion of the electromagnetic field is caused by the charged dipoles induced on the other particles .",
    "our study demonstrates that due to surface plasmons on dust particles , new cutoffs and resonances appear in the electromagnetic wave propagation , as compared with the case when surface oscillations are ignored .",
    "this leads to new branches of electromagnetic waves in complex dusty plasma , not accounted before , and related band gaps .",
    "the presence of surface plasmon resonances makes complex plasma qualitatively different from a classical electron - ion plasma where no resonance are in the basic state ( no external fields ; resonances appear , e.g. , in the presence of external magnetic field  cyclotron resonance ) , and allows us to consider dusty plasma as a metamaterial ( for electromagnetic waves with wavelengths much larger than distances between dust particles ) , either with near zero ( enz ) or very large epsilon ( evl ) @xcite ( we note here that certain analogies also exist between magnetized plasmas and so - called wire media , actively studied in metamaterial applications @xcite ) .",
    "consider a single sphere of radius @xmath0 filled by medium with permittivity @xmath1 , i.e. , we assume that in addition to permittivity @xmath2 there is a number of free charges (  electrons \" ) contributing to drude - like dispersion with plasma frequency @xmath3 ( and no losses ) .",
    "in two limiting cases we have : metal for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and dielectric for @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( vacuum when @xmath4 ) .",
    "the sphere is embedded in a host medium with similar type of permittivity @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "thus we account for two more cases : dielectric host with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( vacuum when @xmath12 ) , and plasma with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . while taking into account the effects of temporal dispersion we ignore effects of space dispersion and other collective plasma phenomena ( such as debye screening , sheath formation , plasma charging currents onto sphere surface , etc . ) .",
    "we assume that surface plasmon fields are electrostatic and oscillate with the frequency @xmath15 ( i.e. , their electrostatic field potential @xmath16 ) . in spherical geometry with azimuthal symmetry ,",
    "solutions of the ( linear ) poisson s equation @xmath17 are @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the legendre polynomials and @xmath20 are ( arbitrary ) functions of frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the multipole expansion ( [ sol1])([sol2 ] ) is in spherical harmonics and corresponds for @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) to constant ( on @xmath23 ) potential inside the sphere , while for higher harmonics @xmath24  to dipole field ( with @xmath25 ) for @xmath26 , quadrupole field for @xmath27 , etc .",
    "the boundary conditions are the continuity of potential @xmath28 and normal ( to the boundary , i.e. , radial in the considered spherical geometry ) component of displacement @xmath29 across @xmath30 .",
    "thus we obtain dispersion equation for surface plasmons j_in=-(j+1)_h .",
    "[ sweps ] for @xmath21 [ const(@xmath23 ) potential inside the sphere ] , we have dispersion equation @xmath31 corresponding to bulk electrostatic plasma - type oscillations ( @xmath32 ) ; the same for any @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( no inclusion and therefore no boundary ) . for @xmath24 , solutions ( surface plasmons )",
    "are possible only for opposite signs of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( i.e. , there is no surface - type solutions when @xmath38 and both @xmath39 ) .",
    "the ( squared ) eigenfrequencies of surface oscillations are _ s , j^2=. [ swfreq2 ] in the limits of metal sphere in vacuum ( @xmath40 , @xmath10 , @xmath5 ) and vacuum spherical void in plasma ( @xmath40 , @xmath6 , @xmath13 ) , respectively , we have known @xcite expressions for the eigenfrequencies of surface plasmon dipole ( @xmath26 ) oscillations @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the factors @xmath43 or @xmath44 are different from @xmath45 for surface oscillations on the boundary of semi - infinite plasma @xcite .",
    "to proceed correctly to the limit of infinitely large radius , we need to sum up all ( the infinite number of ) spherical harmonics contributing to the resulting factor @xmath45 for the semi - infinite plasma ( like calculating plasma permittivity in infinitely small magnetic field , where all cyclotron harmonics have to be sum up in order to obtain the correct field - free limit @xcite ) .    in the presence of external ( with respect to the sphere ) electromagnetic wave field",
    ", we follow garnett @xcite and landau @xcite and proceed only in the dipole approximation ( i.e. , for @xmath26 in the above example of electrostatic fields ) which corresponds to the longest possible range of surface fields . for the electric field",

    "this relation allows us to calculate the induced dipole moment of the sphere and obtain , for a number of identical non - interacting spheres , the so - called dilute limit for the effective permittivity @xcite @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , is the volume fraction occupied by spherical inclusions ( e.g. , dust in plasma ) .",
    "obviously , the volume fraction should be sufficiently small here in order to neglect interactions between spheres .    to account for dipolar interactions between spheres , we apply the excluded volume approach @xcite where the field acting on inclusion particles ( e.g. , dust particles ) is the average host field @xmath52 , which is now appearing on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ displ ] ) instead of @xmath48 .",

    "the averaged field over the entire system , inside as well as outside the spherical inclusions ( dust particles ) , is @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath53 and for @xmath52 we now have @xmath54 .",

    "the resonance in the effective permittivity corresponds to @xmath56 while the cutoff  to @xmath57 .",
    "we note that there is a number of generalizations of mg result ( [ epseff ] ) , e.g. , for anisotropic material of inclusions @xcite . for our purposes here , however , it is sufficient to assume the material isotropy of inclusions ( dust particles ) , as well as isotropic character of embedding host medium ( e.g. , gaseous plasma in dusty plasma experiments ) .    in the limit @xmath58 ( no inclusions in the medium , such as no dust in plasma ) we have from ( [ epseff ] ) @xmath59 . in the opposite ( formal ) limit @xmath60 ( inclusions occupy all space in the host medium )",

    "<S> the dielectric properties of complex plasma containing either metal or dielectric spherical inclusions ( macroparticles , dust ) are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on surface plasmon resonances on the macroparticle surfaces and their effect on electromagnetic wave propagation . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the presence of surface plasmon oscillations significantly modifies plasma electromagnetic properties by resonances and cutoffs in the effective permittivity . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to related branches of electromagnetic waves and to the wave band gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the results are discussed in the context of dusty plasma experiments . </S>"
