    "recently , some experiments have reported narrow signals in the vicinity of 1530 mev in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 invariant mass spectra which are consistent with the exotic pentaquark baryon state @xmath9 with quark content @xmath10 @xcite , while other experiments have searched for this state with negative results . the possible existence",
    "a charm pentaquark has also been discussed , with renewed theoretical interest in calculating their expected properties  @xcite following the observation of strange pentaquarks .",
    "the results of pentaquark searches by the h1 and the zeus collaboration are presented in this report .",
    "the analyses are based on data samples with an integrated luminosity of 75 pb@xmath11 and 126 pb@xmath11 taken by the h1 and the zeus collaborations in the years 1994 - 2000 when hera collided electrons or positrons with 27.6 gev and protons with 820 or 920 gev .",
    "understanding the process whereby quarks and gluons convert to colourless hadrons is one of the outstanding problems in particle physics .",
    "the measurements of the inclusive photoproduction of the neutral mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 could contribute to resolving this problem .",
    "a strange pentaquark @xmath9 candidate was seen by the zeus collaboration . in this analysis deep inelastic scattering ( @xmath12 ) events",
    "were selected by requiring an exchanged photon virtuality @xmath13 gev@xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath9 was reconstructed in the decay channel to @xmath15 .",

    "[ theta ] , the invariant mass of proton and @xmath16 is presented for events with @xmath17 gev@xmath14 .",
    "this distribution was fitted with a polynomial background and two gaussians .",
    "the signal peak is observed with a mass of @xmath18 mev and the measured gaussian width @xmath19 mev which is consistent with the detector resolution .",
    "the significance of the signal is 4.6 sigma .",
    "the second gaussian significantly improves the fit in the low mass region , and has a mass of about 1470 mev and a width of 16 mev and may correspond to the @xmath20 for which the evidence of existence is poor .",
    "the invariant - mass spectrum was investigated for the @xmath15 and @xmath21 separately .",
    "the signal has been seen in both charges with significance of 3 @xmath22 .",
    "if the signal corresponds to the @xmath9 pentaquark , this provides the first evidence for its antiparticle .",
    "the measured total cross section for the @xmath9 in the kinematic region @xmath17 gev@xmath14 , @xmath23 gev , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is @xmath26 pb . the properties of the @xmath9 candidate were studied and it was found to be produced predominantly in the forward pseudorapidity region .",
    "a similar analysis was done by the h1 collaboration and no peak is visible near 1520 mev .",
    "the resulting upper limit on the @xmath9 production cross section was found to vary between 40 and 120 pb over the mass range of 1.48 to 1.7 gev and does not exclude the previously measured cross section at zeus .",
    "( 10.0,5.8 )    na49 collaboration published results of double strange pentaquark @xmath27 searches in the @xmath28 invariant mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "they have observed a narrow peak with mass of about 1860 mev .",
    "a similar analysis was repeated using zeus @xmath12 data .",
    "the @xmath27 was reconstructed from @xmath29 decay .",
    "zeus observed a clean signal of @xmath30 in @xmath12 events with @xmath13 gev@xmath14 , but no signal with a mass around 1860 mev is observed ( fig .",
    "a similar analysis was performed for @xmath17 gev@xmath14 , the kinematic region where the @xmath9 state was most clearly observed by zeus . again",
    "no signal is observed near 1860 mev .",
    "the number of @xmath30 signal events reconstructed in this analysis is about the same as for na49 data .",
    "however , it should be noted that na49 is a fixed target experiment , which has good acceptance in the forward region .",
    "the non - observation of this signal in the central - fragmentation region in the zeus data does not necessarily contradict the observation of a signal predominantly produced in the forward region .",
    "a search for a charm pentaquark @xmath31 candidate was carried out by h1 using @xmath12 data at @xmath13 gev@xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath31 was reconstructed via its decay to @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 is reconstructed using the decay channel @xmath34 .",
    "a clear and narrow resonance is observed for both @xmath35 and @xmath36 combinations with an invariant mass of @xmath37 mev ( fig .",
    "[ thetac ] ) with a significance of 5.4@xmath22 .",
    "the measured width of the resonance is @xmath38(stat . )",
    "mev , consistent with the experimental resolution . a signal with compatible mass and width",
    "is also observed in an independent photoproduction data sample .",
    "( 6.0,3.5 )    an acceptance corrected ratio @xmath39 @xmath40 was measured .",
    "when extrapolating to the full phase space of the decay products one observes a ratio of the visible cross section of @xmath41 @xmath40 .",
    "the region of @xmath42 in which the signal is observed contains a richer yield of @xmath33 mesons and exhibits a harder proton candidate momentum distribution than is the case for side bands in @xmath43 .",
    "compared to inclusive @xmath33 production the @xmath44 production seems to be suppressed in the close to central rapidity regions in laboratory and centre - of - mass frames .",
    "a similar analysis was done by zeus using higher statistics and reconstructing @xmath33 mesons in two channels @xmath34 and @xmath45 .",
    "no signal near 3100 mev is observed .",
    "zeus estimated the upper limit on the acceptance corrected ratio and it is equal 0.59 @xmath40 ( 0.51 @xmath40 for both @xmath33 decay channels ) in @xmath12 .",
    "besides exotic searches for particles the production of well - known hadrons such as pions , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , protons , charm mesons , @xmath48 , _ etc .",
    "_ are measured by zeus and h1 .",
    "a recent result is the cross section measurement of inclusive photoproduction of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons at h1 in the central rapidity region . in this analysis",
    "a photoproduction data sample taken in the year 2000 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38.7 pb@xmath11 and average @xmath49210 gev was used .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons were reconstructed though @xmath50 decay , @xmath0 meson though @xmath51 decay .",
    "( 6.0,5.7 )    in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] , the measured differential cross section @xmath52 of the resonances as a function of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a spin and @xmath55 is a mass of measured particle , was compared with the cross section of charged pions .",
    "the resonances have a similar behavior as observed for long - lived hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the zeus collaboration observes a narrow baryonic state at a mass of about 1520 mev that is interpreted as strange pentaquark @xmath9 .",
    "h1 does not observe this state but the upper limit on the production cross section does not exclude the zeus observation .",
    "a resonance search has been performed in the @xmath32 invariant - mass spectrum with the h1 and the zeus detector .",
    "h1 observes a @xmath56 candidate at mass of about 3100 mev .",
    "zeus does not see any signal near this mass value .",
    "the upper limit on the @xmath56 production contradicts the h1 observation .",
    "more data from hera_ii _ which are now being taken should resolve this contradiction .",
