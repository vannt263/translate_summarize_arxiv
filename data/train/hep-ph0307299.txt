    "recently claimed observational evidence for a @xmath1 10ppm change of the fine structure constant over cosmological time between @xmath2 and @xmath3 brings an unexpected and interesting support to the old idea of dirac @xcite .",
    "the result of webb _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ( if it continues to defy alternative explanations by systematic effects @xcite ) has serious implications for cosmology , astrophysics and particle physics , @xcite-@xcite .    the most powerful conclusion that follows from @xcite is the existence of new fields , massless or nearly massless , and different from gravitation , electromagnetism , neutrinos and axions .",
    "indeed , the `` promotion '' of a coupling constant @xmath4 into a function of time immediately implies that it should also depend on the rest of the coordinates , @xmath5 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath6 in an interacting theory will inevitably generate a kinetic term @xmath7 , so that the `` coupling constant '' becomes a propagating field . in order to avoid confusing terminology of `` changing alpha ''",
    ", it is reasonable to introduce a new degree of freedom , a scalar field @xmath8 , via a chain of relations : @xmath9 we postulate that the scalar field couples to the electromagnetic @xmath10 via some unknown dimensionless function @xmath11 .",
    "using the freedom in the definition , one can always choose @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 is the coupling constant `` today '' , i.e. at the redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the dependence of gauge coupling constants on coordinates can hardly be regarded as a theoretical novelty .",
    "indeed , in string theory / supergravity all effective coupling constants depend on scalar field(s ) @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 .",
    "however , the _ late _ change of @xmath4 , a few billion years after the big bang , implies that some of these fields have essentially near flat potentials , i.e. their masses must be comparable to the hubble parameter at the present epoch @xmath17 ev .",
    "this is in contrast with the phenomenologically developed models of string theory / supergravity , where all moduli are believed to receive electroweak scale masses after supersymmetry breaking , which makes them completely frozen long before nucleosynthesis , not mentioning the present epoch .",
    "therefore , such a late evolution of the effective @xmath18 comes as a total surprise for particle physics .    in general , a nearly massless scalar poses a serious problem of naturalness , which only worsens if this scalar is interacting @xcite .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of a non - renormalizable interaction of the form @xmath19 at the quantum level requires the existence of a momentum cut - off @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately , , any particle physics motivated choice of @xmath20 destabilizes the quintessence potential , i.e. it could induce a mass term much larger than the required @xmath21 . however , because the nature of this fine - tuning is similar to the one required for the smallness of the cosmological constant , we choose to proceed hoping that one day both problems could be resolved simultaneously .    the study of the interaction ( [ tx ] ) has a long history .",
    "initially , it was examined by bekenstein @xcite , who introduced the exponential form for the coupling of the scalar field to the electromagnetic lagrangian which in practice can always be taken in the linear form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "he showed that the exchange by this scalar leads to the effective non - universality of the gravitational force which bounds the possible size of @xmath24 at one per mil level .",
    "the cosmological evolution of @xmath25 is dynamical and it starts immediately after the transition to a matter - dominated universe . in principle , the existence of a non - zero @xmath24 alone is sufficient to ensure the cosmological evolution of @xmath25 , driven by the electromagnetic portion of the baryon mass density .",
    "however , in the minimal bekenstein model where @xmath24 is the only source for @xmath25 , the resulting change of @xmath18 is way too small to be interesting : @xmath26 @xcite an enhancement by up to five - six orders of magnitude may occur by abandoning the minimalistic approach and introducing a `` generalized '' bekenstein model where @xmath25 is driven either by @xmath27 couplings to dark matter or by its own potential @xcite , in which case @xmath28 may be consistent with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "quite independently from the physics of changing couplings , there has been a tremendous increase of interest towards cosmological models with a light scalar field as a possible source of dark energy or quintessence .",
    "evidence for the change of the effective coupling constant is a strong argument in favor of the existence of a scalar field with the wave length comparable to the size of the universe which thus makes it a good candidate for quintessence .",
    "even though the concept of quintessence and the choice if its potential looks completely _ ad hoc _ , some quintessence models have an advantage over a `` simple '' explanation of dark energy by a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "indeed , certain forms of potentials allow for an attractor - type solution , in which case the late cosmological evolution of @xmath25 has no memory of the initial conditions that could be chosen ( almost ) arbitrarily .",
    "the evolution of the energy density of the @xmath25 field is subdominant with respect to the energy density of matter and radiation , and only during the last stages of the cosmological evolution does it become a dominant component .",
    "it is thus intriguing to identify the field @xmath25 responsible for the time dependence of @xmath18 with tracking quintessence and study possible patterns for @xmath29 as a function of cosmological time .    in this paper ,",
    "we present a thorough analysis of a large class of scalar field models with tracking behavior supplemented by a coupling to the electromagnetic field . a similar , but more restricted comparison",
    "has recently been made in @xcite . where appropriate we will compare our results to those .",
    "a successful model must satisfy the following present constraints :    * oklo natural reactor @xmath30 @xcite : @xmath31 * decay rate @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xcite : @xmath34 * cosmic microwave background radiation @xmath35 @xcite : @xmath36 * big bang nucleosynthesis @xmath37 @xcite : @xmath38 * atomic clocks @xmath39",

    "we analyze the scalar field evolution in the tracking regime i.e. , when the energy density of the scalar field remains sub dominant . in this case",
    "we are able to present the _",
    "lower _ bound on @xmath24 consistent with tracking behavior and a non - zero change of the fine structure constant @xcite .",
    "the upper limit in this case is furnished by the direct experimental limit on the non - universality of the gravitational force . as a separate exercise ,",
    "we consider a scalar field as quintessence , i.e. when the tracking regime changes to the scalar field domination at @xmath43 . in this case , we are able to determine the allowed window for @xmath24 , without referring to the constraints from the non - universal gravitational forces . also in the context of a quintessence model , we consider the case of the tracker field driven by the combination of the self potential and the coupling to dark matter .",
    "we confront the predictions for @xmath28 with the above limits from various astronomical and terrestrial observations , and find that the present day limits on @xmath44 and constraints from the big bang nucleosynthesis are generally safe . on the other hand , the @xmath45 coming from the oklo natural reactor @xcite and from the meteoritic abundance data @xcite are generally inconsistent with tracking behavior . in the case of a non - minimal coupling of quintessence to the electromagnetic field ,",
    "the results lose their predictivity as almost any profile for @xmath46 can be achieved by an appropriate choice of @xmath47 .",
    "we go on to discuss a novel possibility that the effective change of the coupling constant occurs only in atomic interactions while @xmath28 remains effectively zero for nuclear physics phenomena .",
    "the construction we propose is based on the idea that the coupling between photons and the scalar field may change for off - shell photons and has a form factor at some energy above the electron mass .",
    "this leads to the suppression of the coupling between the scalar field and the nuclear levels giving a chance to reconcile the results of webb _ et al . _ and the bounds coming from oklo phenomenon without fine - tuning .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we analyze in detail four types of tracking scalar fields and determine the allowed values for @xmath24 .",

    "we adopt a linear dependence on @xmath25 such that @xmath61 , where the subscript 0 represents the present value of the quantity .",
    "the effective fine structure constant depends on the value of @xmath25 as @xmath62 . therefore , we have @xmath63 we will consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with metric @xmath64 .",
    "we further assume a nearly homogeneous scalar field so that the spatial derivatives of the field can be neglected .",
    "hence , we can define analogously to the case of a perfect fluid , the energy density and pressure of a scalar field as , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",

    "a notable exception is when @xmath25 couples strongly and directly to dark matter @xcite .    in the following subsections we will consider different forms of the scalar potential @xmath71 and analyze two possible cases of evolution of the field :",
    "( i ) slow roll down the potential @xmath71 controlled by the friction provided by the background fluid ( tracker evolution ) ; ( ii ) the field provides the source of dark energy , and is just starting to dominate the dynamics leading the universe into a period of accelerated expansion .",

    "moreover , we must allow time for the formation of structure before the universe starts accelerating , which requires @xmath85 to be subdominant after the cmb decoupling",

    "the first regime is perfectly compatible with all experimental data , _ if _ there is an additional component to dark energy which ensures the late time acceleration , as the @xmath25 field itself in this model does not allow for an accelerating expansion .",

    "this table suggests that various models can be consistent with the present day constraints on @xmath186 and with the bbn bounds , however only a few satisfy the oklo bound and only at the cost of severe fine tuning .",
    "the latter models are labeled with ( c ) , ( f ) , ( g ) and ( k ) in table  [ tabela ] . in these models ,",
    "the field performs a low amplitude late time oscillation hence satisfying the oklo bound .",
    "models ( f ) and ( g ) were recently analysed in ref .",
    "the possibility for the kind of behaviour of model ( g ) was pointed out before in ref .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] and table [ tabela ] that in order to have a realistic way of constraining quintessence models we need to employ the wealth of data available on the variations of @xmath18 over time scales much larger than those observed through the qso observations .",
    "late time evolution of @xmath187 for the models in table [ tabela ] that pass the oklo bound : 2exp model ( c ) in dashed line ; a - s models ( f ) and ( g ) of ref .",
    "@xcite in light solid and solid lines respectively ; sugra model ( k ) in dot - dashed line.,width=302 ]    in the next section we propose a mechanism that enable us to reconcile a large detection of a variation on @xmath18 at large redshift with the tight oklo constraint without need of fine tuning in the parameters of the potential .",
    "in this section , we propose a radical alternative to the allowed couplings between the quintessence and electromagnetic field , which will allow us to reconcile all the current constraints on the variation of @xmath18 with the data .",
    "we start by asking what motivates a linear coupling between quintessence and the electromagnetic field ? obviously , there are two simple arguments for this choice : its apparent simplicity and the fact that almost any interaction can be reduced to this form if @xmath47 can be expanded as a series in @xmath188 provided that the latter is small .",
    "this linearization can break down for larger @xmath189 , and thus the comparison with @xmath148 at very high @xmath190 ( i.e. bbn limits ) can only tell us whether the linear dependence needs to be modified .",
    "of course the linear choice is not the only possibility , and quadratic couplings between matter and the scalar field @xcite and const+@xmath191 couplings @xcite being also actively discussed in the past .",
    "all these approaches share the same weakness : they do not calculate these dependences from first principles but rather simply postulate them . in many ways it is analogous to simply choosing a potential for a tracker field by hand .",
    "clearly , when an _ ad hoc _ choice of @xmath47 is allowed , the profile of @xmath46 can not be calculated and any @xmath46 is possible . in particular , one can `` engineer '' such a function @xmath47 such that both the oklo constraint and webb _ et al . _",
    "data points are satisfied .",
    "moreover , one can choose @xmath192 , suppressing the fifth force mediated by @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out another rather generic scenario where the effective fine structure constant is modified in atomic physics but has almost no impact on nuclear and particle physics .",
    "this would allow us to reconcile the oklo constraints with the results of webb _ et al . _ and suppress the non - universality of the gravitational force mediated by @xmath25 .",
    "to do this we propose a momentum dependent modification of the interaction ( [ tx ] ) .",
    "quite generically , the vertex between two photons and a @xmath25 field can be written in the momentum representation as @xmath193 f[p^2,q^2,(pq),\\phi ] \\",
    ", , \\label{vertex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath194 are photon momenta and @xmath195 is the momentum of the scalar field .",
    "( [ vertex ] ) has introduced a form factor @xmath196 that depends on the momenta and the value of the scalar field .",
    "the minimal choice of coupling , @xmath197= \\kappa\\zeta$ ] , was discussed in previous sections . for all practical purposes",
    ", one can neglect the momentum of the scalar field so that f[p^2,q^2,(pq ) ] = f[p^2 ] .",
    "let us now imagine that this coupling has a form factor which tends to zero as @xmath198 becomes larger than a certain critical momentum scale @xmath199 . for definiteness , we assume a power - like suppression , f[p^2 ] = , [ f ] where @xmath200 is the momentum independent fundamental constant .",
    "this choice of @xmath196 leads to the anomalous dependence of the effective coupling constant on the photon virtuality such that @xmath201 in other words , the high virtuality photons always couple to matter with a constant time - independent strength @xmath202 , while the couplings of low virtuality photons are modified by the presence of @xmath25 which evolves with cosmological time .",
    "of course , @xmath203 will have a usual high - energy log - type running with the momentum . in the language of operators the choice ( [ f ] ) would correspond to a new non - local operator that can be written as _",
    "f = -f_f^-14 f_f^ .",
    "[ newoper ] the zeroth order term in the expansion over @xmath204 corresponds to a usual linearized form of ( [ bc ] ) that we were using in the previous sections .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ newoper ] ) does not allow for arbitrary additive redifinition of @xmath25 at @xmath3 .",
    "as before , we assume that the cosmological evolution of @xmath25 is driven by its self potential .    in the absence of the form factor , the effective coupling between nucleons and scalar field , @xmath205 ( see the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , induced via the coupling to photons is given by @xmath206 @xcite , leading to the bound ( [ zetabound ] ) .",
    "it is clear that in order to obtain a further suppression of @xmath207 coupling by the form factor ( [ f ] ) one should choose the scale @xmath199 to be lower than the characteristic virtualities of photons involved in the hadronic and nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the latter are of the order of the inverse characteristic size of a system , which in the case of @xmath207 coupling is the size of the nucleon .",
    "for example , the coupling of @xmath25 to nucleons , @xmath207 , will receive a typical suppression of @xmath208 for @xmath209 : _",
    "n ~10 ^ -3 , [ suppression ] where @xmath210 is roughly the inverse size of a nucleon .",
    "this suppression can be even stronger for a steeper form factor .",
    "this leads to a considerable weakening of all constraints coming from the non - universality due to the @xmath25-exchange .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath199 around @xmath211 mev , we get an additional @xmath212 suppression so that the effective coupling to nucleons is now much smaller @xmath213 .",
    "this results in a much weaker , @xmath214 , bound than eq .",
    "( [ zetabound ] ) .",
    "likewise , the bounds coming from oklo phenomenon will also be weakened .",
    "this is because in the presence of the form factor ( [ p^2 ] ) the dependence of nuclear levels on @xmath25 entering in the standard calculation @xcite is suppressed and consequently these levels are less affected by the change in the @xmath25 field . indeed",
    ", the expected weakening of the oklo bound is at least a factor of @xmath215 with the same choice of @xmath199 . here",
    "@xmath216 mev is a typical inverse radius of a heavy nucleus .",
    "this is just enough to make the results of oklo analysis @xcite compatible with webb _",
    "even with @xmath217 const and _ without any fine tuning_.    on the other hand , the atomic physics phenomena for which the characteristic photon virtualities are much smaller than @xmath218 mev will be sensitive to `` dressed '' @xmath18 that evolves as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , this refers to the relativistic corrections to the atomic energy levels , used for the qso analysis of webb et al .",
    "thus , the existence of the form factor allows to `` isolate '' the phenomenon of changing alpha to atomic physics and remove it from nuclear and particle physics .    the anomalous dependence of the fine structure constant on the photon momentum ( [ low ] ) can be probed with high precision qed measurements , as different experiments probe different photon virtualities .",
    "some of these measurements are performed with atomic and condensed matter systems , where the characteristic momentum transfers are much smaller than @xmath199 .",
    "take , for example , the determination of @xmath18 from the quantum hall effect where the characteristic momenta of photons are very small",
    ". this experiment will be sensitive to the `` dressed '' value of @xmath219 with obvious condition @xmath220 .",
    "on the other hand , the precision measurements sensitive to qed radiative corrections such as electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments can also probe @xmath18 at virtualites comparable to @xmath199 where the value of @xmath18 is given by ( [ p^2 ] ) .",
    "the expression for the magnetic dipole moment of the electron and muon including the first loop correction will be given by d_i , [ d_i ] where @xmath221 .",
    "the electron @xmath222 experiment @xcite has measured the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to an accuracy that allows for the extraction of @xmath223 to nine digits .",
    "now we have to take into account that the one - loop correction has some photons with virtualities @xmath224 .",
    "this will introduce a correction to @xmath222 of the electron due to the anomalous behaviour of @xmath18 at large momenta at the level of @xmath225 for @xmath226 mev and typical @xmath227 suggested by webb _",
    "this correction is taken relative to the value of @xmath222 calculated with `` fully dressed '' value of @xmath18 ( [ low ] ) . since @xmath228 is used for the extraction of @xmath18 , one should absorb correction ( [ ge ] ) into the measured value of @xmath18 and compare it with the second best determination of the fine structure constant from the quantum hall effect .",
    "the correction ( [ ge ] ) corresponds to the shift of @xmath223 in the eighth digit which appears to be marginally consistent with the determination of @xmath18 from the solid state physics @xcite .",
    "the largest effect is expected in the @xmath222 of the muon , where the radiative corrections probe `` undressed '' @xmath18 , or @xmath202 , ( [ p^2 ] ) at virtualities comparable to the muon mass , which is much larger than a chosen value of @xmath229 mev .",
    "therefore , the expected correction to the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( relative to the value one would expect with `` dressed '' @xmath18 given by ( [ low ] ) ) will be on the order ( g-2)_~ ( ) , [ gmu ] which is _ larger _ than both the experimental and theoretical accuracy of @xmath230 , unless @xmath231 , where @xmath25 is the value of the scalar field _ now_. this might still be marginally consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite if @xmath232 .",
    "therefore , the anomalous running of @xmath18 with the momentum ( [ low ] ) , ( [ p^2 ] ) comes tantalizingly close to the accuracy of modern tests of qed . at the same time",
    ", it allows us to disconnect the phenomenon of `` changing @xmath18 '' from nuclear and hadronic physics .",
    "this way the results of webb _ et al .",
    "_ coming from the atomic physics , are not in contradiction with oklo phenomenon and are of no immediate consequence for the fifth - force experiments .",
    "we have studied a variety of cosmological scalar field models coupled to the electromagnetic lagrangian .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field over cosmological times induces the effective change of the fine structure constant .",
    "we have considered two generic possibilities :    \\(i ) tracker solution .",
    "we have shown that for a wide range of models where the scalar field is tracking , there exists a region in parameter space which allows concordance with the qso data on non - zero @xmath29 @xcite with other constraints on @xmath45 coming from the big bang nucleosynthesis as well as the precision measurements of the universality of the gravitational force .",
    "the predictions for the present day @xmath186 are typically within one order of magnitude from current experiments and within the reach of near future laboratory experiments",
    ". typical constraints on the parameter space are shown in figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] and [ figure51 ] .",
    "there is an upper bound on the mass scale @xmath112 or @xmath129 from the requirement that the tracking solution persists until @xmath3 and @xmath233 today .",
    "the consequence of this is the lower bound on @xmath24 , the coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic @xmath10 .",
    "this typically leads to @xmath234 ( see figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] , [ figure51 ] and from the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ omegadm ] ) in the region of parameters studied .",
    "the universality of the gravitational force puts an upper bound on the coupling , @xmath235 .",
    "\\(ii ) dark energy .",
    "we have found that the simple inverse power law model for quintessence also offers a _",
    "small _ region of parameter space in agreement with the qso observations . here , for a chosen @xmath111 the mass scale @xmath112 is fixed , therefore , the only free parameter remaining is the coupling @xmath24 .",
    "to fit the qso data for a chosen @xmath111 we obtain one single @xmath24 ( or a small window due to the uncertainties related with the data ) .",
    "we have also considered the model of the scalar field coupled to the dark matter .",
    "we have found that only large values ( if @xmath78 is negative ) of the slope of the scalar potential allow this model to pass the equivalence principle constraints .",
    "this model can generate oscillatory behaviour for @xmath236 which may lead to the enhancement of the present day signal of @xmath237 .",
    "we looked at other models of quintessence suggested in the literature .",
    "their relevant properties for this work are summarised in table [ tabela ] .",
    "we expect that complimentary information on the present equation of state of the universe , on the coupling @xmath24 and on the ratio @xmath44 can help us to back up or rule out models of quintessence and scenarios in which a dynamical subdominant scalar field is evolving in a tracking regime .",
    "a notable feature of this detailed analysis is that apart from a small region of parameter space in some quintessence models with late time oscillations ( e.g. , models ( c ) , ( f ) , ( g ) and ( k ) of table  [ tabela ] ) we have not come accross a model that satisfies both the oklo bound @xmath238 at @xmath239 and @xmath240 at @xmath241 reported by webb _",
    "et al._. in an attempt to reconcile this , we have suggested that the existence of form factor in the coupling of @xmath24 at around 10 mev with respect to the photon momentum may lead to the suppression of the effective coupling between @xmath25 and nucleons and nuclei .",
    "this is sufficient to isolate the phenomenon of changing couplings to the realm of atomic physics , while relaxing the bounds coming from the oklo phenomenon and the fifth - force experiments .",
    "this amounts to postulating an anomalous running of @xmath18 with momentum and thus gives an additional possibility of checking this idea with high - precision qed measurments , sensitive to various ranges of the photon virtualities .",
