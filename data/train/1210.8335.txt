    "an important challenge for strong field rotational control is selective excitation in a mixture of different molecular species .",

    "the alternative `` double pulse '' scheme reaches the same goal by using two properly timed linearly polarised pulses  @xcite .",
    "the first pulse induces molecular alignment .",
    "when the alignment reaches its peak , the second pulse , whose polarisation is rotated by 45 degree with respect to the first one , is applied and induces the directed rotation .",
    "more recently , an approach using a `` chiral pulse train '' was demonstrated  @xcite , in which a train of pulses is used , where the pulse polarisation is changed by a constant angle from pulse to pulse ( see fig .  [ scenario ] ) .    in this article",

    "the chiral pulse train is formed by linearly polarised pulses , uniformly separated in time by a time - delay @xmath4 , with a constant pulse - to - pulse angular shift @xmath3 of the polarisation direction .",
    "we showed that for certain combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , molecular rotation with a strong preferential rotational sense ( clockwise or counter - clockwise ) can be excited . in two - dimensional plots of the excited population and the rotational directionality as a function of the pulse train period and the pulse - to - pulse polarisation shift ,",
    "a distinct pattern is found .",
    "it is made out of diagonal lines along which a strong preferential rotational sense is achieved .",
    "our analysis shows that this pattern is caused by quantum interferences of different excitation pathways , which interfere constructively along the above mentioned lines .",
    "we demonstrated the feasibility for selective excitation of nuclear spin isomers and isotopologues in a mixture by the chiral pulse train .",
    "we demonstrated the selectivity using para - nitrogen and ortho - nitrogen as an example . by choosing the parameters of the chiral pulse train such that they address only the states of certain parity",
    ", one can selectively excite one of the isomers . since for the chiral pulse train one can also influence the direction of the molecular rotation",
    ", it is even possible to induce counter - rotation of different nuclear spin isomers .",
    "selective excitation of isotopologues can be reached by making use of the different rotational time - scales of different isotopologues .",
    "the pulse train parameters can be chosen such that they lead to strong excitation of a preferable isotopologue .",
    "for other isotopologues in the mixture , the same pulse train most likely leads to a destructive interference of different excitation pathways , so these isotopologues are at best only weakly excited .",
    "spin isomer and isotopologue selective excitation using the chiral pulse train was recently shown in experiments  @xcite , demonstrating a good agreement with our theoretical analysis .    finally , we investigated the excitation of the more complex @xmath70o@xmath1 molecule by the chiral pulse train .",
    "for this molecule , the rotational levels are split due to spin - spin and spin - orbit interactions .",
