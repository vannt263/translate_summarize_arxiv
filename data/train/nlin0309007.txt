    "this has led to a tremendous activity in engineered qpm gratings for applications in photonics .",
    "a proper design of the longitudinal grating structure allows , e.g. , for distortion free temporal pulse compression @xcite , broad - band phase matching @xcite , multi - wavelength shg @xcite , enhanced cascaded phase shift@xcite , and optical diodes@xcite and gates@xcite . in high power schemes ,",
    "qpm solitons are known to exist@xcite and longitudinal engineering can be used to tailor the solitons@xcite and to increase the bandwidth for their generation@xcite .",
    "transverse patterning can be used for beam - tailoring @xcite , broad - band shg @xcite , and soliton steering @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nonuniform temperature distributions in the heated material may occur , leading to longitudinal dependent qpm conditions .",
    "this can result in a reduced nonlinear conversion efficiency@xcite or lead to positive effects such as a reduction of the fundamental - wave losses in cascaded phase shift configurations@xcite .",
    "the work presented here aims at characterizing these qpm structures in a non - destructive manner .",
    "the second - harmonic - generation process ( shg ) has traditionally been the preferred choice in such attempts , since it requires only one tunable laser . by working in the low power regime",
    ", fourier transform theory can be applied to retrieve the grating function . until now",
    "the proposed methods have required the measurement of both the phase and the power in the generated sh field .",
    "such methods are difficult to realize experimentally and it would be much more convenient if only the power was required .",
    "this is indeed what we propose here . by utilizing a mirror in the setup",
    "we show how it is possible , in principle at least , to obtain all relevant information via easily performed power - only measurements .",
    "we start by developing the general fourier scheme with arbitrary choice of mirrors in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "afterwards we apply the scheme to the concrete case of ppln . in section [ sec : grafun ] we focus on determining the grating function .",
    "this can be done at room temperature because we operate in the low power regime , i.e. we can neglect photo - refractive effects . when heated the temperature distribution along the crystal may become nonuniform and the determination of such temperature profiles is the subject of section [ sec : tempprof ] . throughout the paper we have made an effort to ensure that the numerical simulations are in agreement with the parameter settings which will be encountered in the laboratory .",

    "@xmath30 is the intrinsic strength of the largest second order susceptibility coefficient exploited in qpm configurations which for lithium niobate is @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , in experiments the crystals are often heated to eliminate photo - refractive effects .",
    "the heating is in general nonuniform and therefore the phase mismatch becomes @xmath2-dependent through @xmath32 .",
    "the real and measurable powers @xmath33 and @xmath34 at the fw and at the sh , respectively , are via the normalization given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the impedance of free space and @xmath38 is the cross area of the gaussian pump beam .",
    "we emphasize that for normal temperature variations , i.e. @xmath39 , the variations in the refractive indices are small . hence @xmath40 can be assumed to depend only on @xmath5 and a reference temperature @xmath41 which we take to be the temperature at the beginning of the crystal .",
    "we also note that because of the way we have chosen to normalize the system we measure @xmath40 in watts , i.e. @xmath42=\\mbox{w}$ ] , and @xmath43 in reciprocal meters , i.e. @xmath44=\\mbox{m}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this normalization allows us to operate with the relevant physical parameters , i.e. the wavelengths , the grating period , the phase mismatch , and the temperature , while preserving a simple structure in the governing equations .",
    "as described in the introduction , we aim at solving the inverse problem , i.e. to determine the grating function @xmath28 , knowing only the input powers at both wavelengths and the output power of the sh . solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn : shg1]-[eqn : shg2 ] ) for @xmath28 in principle requires information on both the input and output amplitude at both wavelengths and the relative phases .",
    "the problem is significantly reduced by assuming that the fw is undepleted in which case the solution can be found by applying the inverse fourier transformation on eq .",
    "( [ eqn : shg2 ] ) . to simplify the argument",
    "we keep the temperature uniform for the moment and launch only fw . the normalized sh intensity at the output of the crystal is then given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the grating function modified with the window function @xmath47 which is 1 if @xmath48 and 0 otherwise , with @xmath49 being the length of the crystal .",
    "the complex fourier transform has been defined as @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes its conjugated . in general",
    "we do not know any of the symmetry properties of the grating function , except that it is real , and hence we can not hope to determine the grating function from eq.([eqn : intshg2 ] ) knowing only the power spectrum of the sh alone ; additional phase information is required .",
    "however , we observe that if we could force the grating function to be even then by virtue of symmetry properties the fourier transform would become real and in principle eq.([eqn : intshg2 ] ) could then be solved without the phase information .",
    "one way in which we can force the grating function to be even , is to put a mirror directly at the output surface of the qpm crystal .",
    "mathematically speaking we simply prolong the original grating function with its mirror image and let this new grating function of length @xmath52 enter as @xmath53 in eq.([eqn : shg2 ] ) .",
    "naturally any temperature distribution would likewise become an even function in @xmath2 . in fig .",

    "the waves are affected in two ways by the mirror : they experience a phase shift and they are attenuated . though we shall later focus on metallic mirrors where both wavelengths experience a @xmath54 phase shift , we here set up more general mirror conditions since other mirrors such as dielectric ones might be of interest . at the mirror",

    "eq.([eqn : firstmirror ] ) is the starting point for all further analysis in this paper and in the next section we show how it applies to the case of a metallic mirror . here",
    ", however , we feel that we must supply a few general comments on the structure of the integrals in eq.([eqn : firstmirror ] ) which eventually will be solved by applying fourier theory .",
    "the way we have set up eq.([eqn : firstmirror ] ) indicates that we have chosen the @xmath2-independent part of the phase mismatch , @xmath66 , and the coordinate @xmath2 to be our fourier variables . in an experimental situation",
    "we have the option of changing @xmath66 through either of the two independent variables , i.e. through the pump wavelength @xmath5 or through the reference temperature @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that application of fourier s integral theorem to any of the integrals in eq.([eqn : firstmirror ] ) requires that the function @xmath67 must be independent of @xmath66 or more specifically : @xmath67 must be independent of the independent variable through which we change @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath67 depends explicitly on @xmath5 through the way we have defined @xmath68 above , we can immediately rule out to determine temperature profiles by changing @xmath66 through the wavelength .",
    "hence temperature profiles must be determined by changing @xmath66 through temperature .",
    "in theory this requires that @xmath64 be independent of @xmath41 and in section [ sec : tempprof ] we show that for small variations in temperature this can indeed be assumed to be so .",
    "the same assumption has been applied on waveguides in ppln@xcite and thus the theory presented here is applicable for other materials and experimental setups .    once the mirror type has been decided on eq.([eqn : firstmirror ] ) is readily solved even if it looks complicated .",
    "we notice that by proper engineering of the mirror we can make either the sum or the difference between the two reflection amplitude coefficients in eq.([eqn : firstmirror ] ) vanish .",
    "it is this fact that allows us to simplify eq.([eqn : firstmirror ] ) .",
    "put differently we can state that because of the spatial symmetries of the mirror - expanded grating function , which forces the involved fourier integrals to be real , it is essentially no longer necessary to obtain the phase information that we need in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : intshg2 ] ) .",
    "we now focus on exploiting metallic mirrors .",
    "these mirrors are relatively cheap and can be produced with reflection amplitude coefficients very close to 1 .",
    "though the coefficients are wavelength dependent , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath69 and that they vary little around each of the wavelengths . with both waves experiencing a @xmath70 phase shift , the sum between the reflection amplitude coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : firstmirror ] ) vanishes and the unseeded normalized sh output intensity as found from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : firstmirror ] ) becomes @xmath71{{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{d } } } } z$ ] . from fourier s integral",
    "theorem we then know that @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the imaginary and real part , respectively , of the inverse fourier transform .",
    "again @xmath75 is the grating function modified with the window function @xmath47 according to @xmath46 where @xmath76 if @xmath48 and 0 otherwise .",
    "with no temperature profile present , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 becomes an odd function in @xmath66 .",
    "hence we can apply the inverse fourier sine transform , @xmath79 , and determine the grating function through @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the measured sh output power and the fw input power , respectively , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : intensities ] ) .",
    "we notice that both @xmath40 and @xmath81 are functions of @xmath66 and that the inverse sine transform must be applied to the product of the two functions .",
    "in principle we can now determine any grating function in a uniform temperature distribution simply by measuring the sh output power as a function of the pump wavelength ; _ additional phase information is no longer required_. the attentive reader will have noticed that the arguments of the inverse fourier transforms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : extres ] ) should have been functions of the absolute value of the sh field @xmath83 instead of just the real value @xmath84 .",
    "of course @xmath83 is what we measure but we need the sign information to correctly reconstruct the grating function and temperature profile . luckily the sign information is easily retrieved by exploiting that the derivative of @xmath84 with respect to @xmath66 must be a smooth function in @xmath66 whereas the derivative of @xmath83 is not . whenever the sign of @xmath84 changes we get non - analytical points in the derivative of @xmath83 with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "these points can be located numerically and hence @xmath84 can be determined .",
    "in the following we present simulation results validating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thirdmirror ] ) and we discuss the determination of the grating function in uniform temperature profiles . as mentioned above we are now , because of the mirror , able to reconstruct any grating function simply by measuring the sh output power @xmath81 as a function of pump wavelength . in this section",
    "we shall first verify eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thirdmirror ] ) with simulations on a perfectly periodic qpm crystal , i.e. we show that the contribution from the first integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : firstmirror ] ) is negligible even if we have considerable mirror losses in the setup .",
    "secondly we shall focus on the case of a perfectly periodic crystal with a duty - cycle different from @xmath85 .",
    "this example clearly illustrates the differences between the same experiments made with and without the mirror and hence emphasizes the strength of the presented scheme .",
    "the last part of this section is dedicated to a discussion of the limitations of the presented scheme .",
    "we remark that these limitations are not a consequence of not making phase measurements but rather an inherent problem of applying fourier theory to the particular case of determining qpm gratings in periodically poled materials .",
    "we leave the determination of temperature gradients to the next section and set @xmath86 in eq .",

    "this yields a fw intensity of @xmath96 . to establish whether this intensity is in the low - depletion regime we use the analytical solution at perfect phase matching for shg with first order qpm@xcite . for propagation distances less than @xmath97 we get that the fw is unaltered to within @xmath98 of its initial value .",
    "the numerical results confirm that this is indeed in the low depletion regime . regarding the detection of the sh output we shall here assume that we can measure 0.1@xmath99w and numerically put all values below that to zero . in the following we refer to this value as the cut - off on the sh power measurement .      to illustrate the method and to verify it in the presence of mirror losses we here consider the case of determining the domain length in a perfectly periodic crystal with a duty - cycle @xmath85 , i.e. the domain length is the same for the @xmath100 and @xmath101 domains",
    "the grating function can be expanded according to @xmath102 choosing first order qpm , i.e. @xmath103 in eq .",

    "the reflection amplitude coefficients have been chosen so that the difference between them is sufficiently big to encompass any differences we imagine could be encountered in the laboratory .",
    "finally we assume that the laser shares the above discussed characteristic with a fw power of @xmath110 and scan through the pump wavelength interval with a step - length of @xmath111 which yields a total of 500 measurements .",
    "it is well known@xcite that we would also get a sinc - shaped tuning curve from the corresponding no - mirror case and that the phase information likewise is not needed to reconstruct the actual grating function .",
    "the numerical experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig : tuncurve_pc ] is non - trivial because it shows that we can apply the approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : secondmirror ] ) , i.e. that the scheme works even for considerable mirror losses .",
    "in fact , we have put the theoretical curve as found from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pftheoretical ] ) on top of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : tuncurve_pc ] and the experimental points fall on the curve to within the precision inherent to the fourier transform and to within the precision owing to the cut - off on the sh power measurement .    to recover the grating function",
    "we need to generate the full tuning curve spanning the entire @xmath66-axis , thus covering all the qpm peaks owing to the different qpm orders .",
    "numerically speaking , however , we only need to take into account the first few peaks and here we have chosen to work with the 7 first higher order peaks , making the computational effort tolerable .",
    "the expansion of the tuning curve is fairly trivial in the case of the perfectly periodic duty - cycle @xmath85 crystal .",
    "first we locate the maximum of the tuning curve on the @xmath66-axis .",
    "once we know the location @xmath112 of the maximum , then eq . ( [ eqn : pftheoretical ] ) tells us that the @xmath99th order peak is located at @xmath113 .",
    "we remark that the @xmath66-axis and the @xmath5-axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : tuncurve_pc ] are connected through the sellmeier eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sellmeier ] ) and we notice how the absolute value of @xmath66 here is a decreasing function in @xmath5 . hence on the @xmath5-axis the higher order qpm peaks are located closer to @xmath114 whereas they are located at numerically higher values of @xmath66 than the maximum value on the @xmath66-axis .",
    "the series of experiments is performed keeping the step - length @xmath115 constant .",
    "since the sellmeier equation is nonlinear the step - length @xmath116 on the @xmath66-axis will not be constant and numerical routines must be supplied to fix this problem .",
    "we can estimate the resolution in the @xmath2-domain , i.e. the inverse fourier domain , through @xmath117 , where @xmath118 are the total number of experiments . by using the shortest step - length we find on the original @xmath66-axis we get an estimate on the coarsest resolution we can expect yielding @xmath119 which is good enough to resolve domain lengths on the order of 10@xmath120 .",
    "we are now ready to apply eq .",
    "( [ eqn : extres ] ) and perform the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grating_pc ] .",
    "the figure shows both the complete recovered function and two enhancements : one of the middle part and one of the part around the end of the crystal .",
    "the figure showing the complete recovered function is entirely black owing to the fact that the value of @xmath28 changes @xmath121 times in the interval @xmath122 $ ] . from the enhanced part of the grating function from the middle of the crystal we observe that the domain length is correctly retrieved .",
    "the small oscillations around @xmath123 are due to the inherent difficulties in making numerical fourier transforms and can only be reduced by enhancing the resolution . on the other hand",
    "the oscillations are not critical in the case of ppln since we now that @xmath123 and can not take any values in between .",
    "somewhat more critical is the fact that we according to the close up of the part around the end of the crystal do not get a nice sharp cut at @xmath124 .",
    "instead we get a slow decrease in the value of @xmath28 which eventually becomes zero as can be seen from the figure showing the entire grating function .",
    "we have verified that the problems in correctly retrieving the grating function around the end of the crystal are due to the cut - off on the sh power measurement . with a lower cut - off",
    "the grating function goes to zero within very few oscillations .    in conclusion",
    "we can say that with no cut - off on the sh power measurement and with indefinite resolution the grating would off course have been perfectly retrieved . on the other hand",
    "this is what we would expect from experiments like this and as such it is not a consequence of the scheme we propose , i.e. experiments made with no mirror by measuring the phase instead would be subject to the same difficulties .",

    "duty - cycle errors are not uncommon and hence it would be a reasonable starting point to assume that we are dealing with exactly that , then perform the analysis , and then verify the nature of the error by simply holding it up against the theoretical solution .    in order to determine the duty - cycle and the domain length we need to measure two things in fig .",

    "we shall keep this discussion on the limitations of the inverse method short since these are a consequence of the nature of the fourier transform rather than due to the here proposed scheme with the mirror setup .",
    "essentially the biggest hurdle for the inverse method is the limited @xmath66-bandwidth owing to the limited wavelength range for the used lasers .",
    "this is of course connected to the fact that using ppln moves the central peak on the tuning curve far away from @xmath142 which means that the @xmath66-bandwidth in practice must be huge to encompass all the information of the sh tuning curve .",

    "aperiodic functions in general have dense fourier spectra and hence we would not be able to get all the necessary information to retrieve the grating function . in a traditional setup with no mirror grating functions with stochastic boundary errors , with missing domain reversals or with single domains of different length like the optical diode@xcite",

    "we have verified that the scheme can also be applied to the case of a linear increase in the domain length .",
    "we now turn towards experimental conditions where a temperature profile , @xmath63 , is present . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mirror_crystal_temp ] we have sketched such a situation emphasizing how the temperature profile , like the grating function , becomes an even function in @xmath2 when utilizing the mirror setup .    as discussed in section [ sec : theory ] we must change @xmath66 through varying the temperature rather than the wavelength in order to determine temperature profiles .",

    "first of all the function @xmath143 must be independent of the reference temperature @xmath41 . in theory",
    "this must hold true everywhere on the @xmath66-axis , which of course is impossible to assure . in practice however , it suffices that it holds true only within the narrow intervals on the @xmath66-axis where the non - trivial part of the tuning curve most often is located . in the following we verify through simulations that this is indeed so .",
    "the second implication of the sellmeier equation being nonlinear concerns the last step of retrieving the temperature profile since this involves determining the temperature at a propagation distance @xmath2 knowing the refractive index at that coordinate .",
    "assuming that the variations in temperature owing to the temperature profile are small , we can retrieve the temperature by taylor expanding the sellmeier equation .",
    "when @xmath144 the tuning curve , essentially @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : secondmirror ] ) , is no longer an odd function in @xmath66 .",
    "hence the expansion of the tuning curve to the negative @xmath66-axis is more complicated than before .",
    "however , here we shall again consider the case of the perfectly periodic square grating for which the expansion is reasonable straight forward .",

    "the only difference is that we have now scanned through the reference temperature @xmath41 , with step - length @xmath154 , instead of through the pump wavelength which we have fixed at @xmath155 m . with no temperature profile ,",
    "the sample is phase matched at @xmath156 which is reached at @xmath157 .",
    "the presence of a temperature profile changes the phase matching condition and we observe that the tuning curve on fig . [",
    "fig : tuncurve_tempstep ] is no longer sinc - shaped and that the main peak is shifted towards a higher absolute value of @xmath66 . as we would expect from eq .",

    "@xmath63 will of course not remain independent of the reference temperature over an interval this large . to illustrate that we still gain information with a narrower interval we show the @xmath161 simulation . for longer crystals the tuning curves",
    "will in general be even narrower .",
    "we remark that temperature profiles like the ones depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempex ] have been determined before from experimental measurements on uniform lithium niobate@xcite . however , those experiments relied on the oven producing an even temperature profile , i.e. the absolute values of the linear increase and decrease at the beginning and at the end of the oven , respectively , were the same . the profiles from fig .",
    "[ fig : tempex ] are odd and hence can not be determined through fourier analysis without either aquiring phase information or , as we have done here , by utilizing the mirror setup .",
    "in summary we have investigated how the mirror - setup paves the way for characterization of grating functions and temperature profiles via second - harmonic - power measurements only , i.e. without additional phase information .",
    "the grating function and temperature profile both become even functions in the propagation coordinate because of the mirror and we derived the fourier scheme , including losses and phase shifts due to the mirror , to solve the inverse problem , i.e. to find the grating function and temperature profile knowing only the second harmonic tuning curve as a function of either wavelength or temperature .",
    "we verified the scheme through numerical simulations on bulk ppln and showed how to retrieve information which is bandwidth limited to within the realizable phase - mismatch interval . in particular we investigated the case of the perfectly periodic duty - cycle waveguide for which we can determine both the domain length and the duty - cycle by simply looking at the tuning curve resulting from the mirror setup . concerning temperature profiles we found that if we know the grating function then in theory we can determine any temperature profile .",
