    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are dominated by dark matter .",
    "their stellar populations are dynamically unimportant and the rotation curves are thus direct tracers of their dark matter distributions @xcite .",
    "this is important , as in brighter galaxies it is difficult to disentangle the dynamical contributions of the dark and visible matter , and unambiguously determine the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "lsb galaxies give us a unique opportunity to compare observations with cosmological dark matter simulations .",
    "these numerical models , based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , make very specific predictions about the distribution of dark matter in galaxies @xcite . in cdm",
    "halos the mass density distribution in the inner parts is characterized by a steep density `` cusp '' , usually described by a power - law @xmath1 with slopes varying from @xmath2 @xcite to @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this cusp manifests itself in a steeply rising rotation curve with a specific shape .",
    "observations of dwarf and lsb galaxies @xcite show that real rotation curves rise less steeply than predicted , and do not have the required cdm shape .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached by @xcite and @xcite for high surface brightness disk galaxies . at small radii",
    ", the empirically determined mass distribution can be well described by a central kpc - sized constant - density core ( i.e.  @xmath4 in the inner parts ) ( @xcite [ hereafter dbmbr and dbb02 respectively ] ) .",
    "dbmbr and dbb02 base their conclusions on observations of rotation curves of over 60 lsb galaxies .",
    "they determine the mass density profiles that give rise to the observed rotation curves and fit the inner parts with a single power - law .",
    "the resulting distribution of inner mass - density slopes shows a strong peak at @xmath0 ( see fig .  2 in dbmbr ) , but with a large spread , varying from steep and cuspy @xmath5 profiles to flat and even moderately positive slopes",
    "this was interpreted as a result of resolution effects : dbmbr find that the best resolved curves show the flattest profiles ( see fig .  3 in dbmbr and fig .  14 in dbb02 ) ,",
    "contrary to what is expected for cdm . at lower resolutions",
    "the cdm and the iso models both predict the same slopes , leading to an ambiguity as to which model fits lower resolution data best .    however , resolution is not the only effect that can influence the measured slopes",
    ". other effects , which dbmbr and dbb02 did not thoroughly investigate , include non - circular motions , offsets between dynamical and optical centres , lopsidedness , asymmetries , and slit - width .",
    "these effects all have the potential to decrease the measured inner mass - density slopes .",
    "it is thus important to investigate if the observed shallow slopes truly reflect the underlying mass distribution , or whether they are determined by systematic effects .",
    "for example , small offsets between the dynamical centre and the optical centre are sometimes observed in late - type barred galaxies @xcite . if this were a systematic property of all lsb or dwarf galaxies then observations aligned on the optical centre would not necessarily probe the dynamical centre .",
    "even if the galaxy in question had a steep cdm density cusp at the dynamical centre , the derived slope would be shallower , giving the impression of a core - dominated halo .",
    "hence these systematic effects should be understood , in order to judge whether lsb galaxies have cuspy or core - dominated halos .",
    "furthermore , once the impact ( if any ) of these systematic effects is understood , one could hope to determine how much they contribute to the scatter in the observed slopes , and whether the range in observed slopes can be attributed to `` cosmic scatter '' or whether a single halo profile for all galaxies suffices .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the importance of these systematic effects by deriving a large ensemble of rotation curves of both cuspy cdm and core - dominated ( simulated ) halos , using observed curves as a constraint .",
    "we apply the relevant systematic effects to these simulated curves , and then determine the inner mass - density slopes .",
    "our main conclusion is that none of the systematic effects investigated can convincingly wipe out the signature of a cdm halo . in other words , if lsb galaxies had cdm halos , they would be unambiguously detectable , even in the presence of systematic effects .",
    "the most likely interpretation is that the observed core - dominated mass - distribution reflects the true dark matter distribution in lsb galaxies .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  2 discusses some aspects of the observational comparison sample .",
    "section  3 describes the simulations .",
    "section  4 contains the results of simulations that include various systematic effects . in sect .",
    "5 we describe some tests performed with real data , while in sect .",
    "6 we attempt to use the simulations to improve on the halo model used . in sect .",
    "7 we present our conclusions .",
    "the model rotation curves we derive will be compared with the results presented in dbmbr and dbb02 .",
    "the focus will be on the histograms of the inner slope @xmath6 ( dbmbr , their fig .",
    "2 ) and the diagrams of inner slope @xmath6 versus resolution @xmath7 of the rotation curve ( dbmbr , their fig .  3 and dbb02 , their fig .",
    "these diagrams are based on power - law fits to the inner parts of the mass - density profiles derived from the @xmath8 high - resolution rotation curves from @xcite , @xcite and dbb02 .",
    "these rotation curves are measured from long - slit h@xmath6 spectra , mostly sampling the kinematics in the inner parts , in many cases combined with lower - resolution hi  rotation curves sampling the outer parts @xcite .",
    "these data span a large range in resolution , inclination , and general quality of the rotation curves .",
    "it is therefore worth asking whether the data themselves may in any way be biased by systematic effects .",
    "for example , if all the core - like profiles found turned out to have been derived from low - resolution , low - quality rotation curves , one would have valid reasons to question the usefulness of those data and conclusions based on them .",
    "@xcite present such an analysis where they analyse only those rotation curves that resemble nfw cdm rotation curves best , and conclude that there is no systematic difference in the distributions of @xmath9 for their restricted and total samples .",
    "here we make a similar comparison , but concentrate on the properties relevant for our comparison with simulations , namely distributions of @xmath9 and the inner slope @xmath6 . starting with the complete sample from dbmbr and dbb02 ( see fig .",
    "[ goodslope ] ) , we apply the following cuts : firstly , we remove all galaxies with inclinations @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this leaves 44 galaxies .",
    "the resulting distribution is insensitive to the choices for the upper and lower inclination limit : we have tried cuts with lower limits of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and upper limits of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and find almost identical distributions .",
    "secondly , we remove all galaxies with low - quality rotation curves , i.e.  with a small number of independent data points , with large error - bars , and large asymmetries .",
    "galaxies where the minimum - disk assumption is clearly not valid were removed as well ( e.g.  ugc 6614 ) .",
    "the resulting sample contains 39 galaxies . finally , as the difference between cusp and core is most clearly visible in the innermost part of the galaxies , we demand that the inner part is resolved : we retain only those galaxies that have at least 2 independent data points in the inner 1 kpc .",
    "this leaves us with a final sample of 19 galaxies , listed in table  [ sample ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ goodslope ] .",
    "a comparison of the different stages of pruning shows no systematic differences between the distributions of the initial full sample and final restricted sample .",
    "if anything , the peak of the distribution of inner slopes @xmath6 has shifted towards a more positive value .",
    "the tail towards negative slopes has disappeared .",
    "the peak in the @xmath9-distribution still occurs near @xmath16 , and the peak at @xmath17 is still present in the final sample .",
    "recently , @xcite [ hereafter smbb ] have made a similar analysis of a sample of 15 dwarf and lsb galaxies .",
    "they reach the conclusion that the inner mass density slopes in their sample cover the full range @xmath18 , but claim that though their data prefer a shallow @xmath19 slope , they can not rule out steep @xmath20 slopes for their sample .",
    "the analysis presented in the previous section and in dbmbr suggests that a large fraction of the steep slopes one finds are actually due to insufficient resolution .",
    "it would thus be interesting to see if these effects are also present in the smbb data .",
    "we subjected their data to the same quality criteria that we used for ours . in practice",
    "this meant that 5 galaxies with less than 2 independent points in the inner kpc were rejected ( f563-v2 , f568 - 1 , f568 - 3 , f568-v1 , f574 - 1 ) , as well as one galaxy ( u5721 ) where the minimum disk assumption is invalid .",
    "a high - resolution optical velocity field of u5721 @xcite clearly shows the presence of a kinematical minor axis not perpendicular to the major axis . this is a classical indication of an oval distortion @xcite .",
    "for this galaxy , there are images in the hst archive that show the presence of a weak bar ( see also dbb02 , their sec .",
    "9.2.2 . , noting that u5721 is also known as n3274 ) .",
    "we are thus left with 9 well - resolved rotation curves .",
    "our restricted sample has three galaxies in common with this restricted smbb sample .",
    "we find that for two of these galaxies the measured slopes are consistent at better than @xmath21 ( ugc 731 and ugc 4325 ) . for one galaxy ( ugc 11557 )",
    "the slopes differ significantly : smbb find @xmath22 , while dbmbr find @xmath23 .",
    "an inspection of the density profiles in fig .  1 of dbmbr and fig .",
    "5 in smbb shows that this difference in slope is entirely due to a different choice of break radius , where smbb have chosen a larger radius than dbmbr , resulting in a much steeper slope . choosing a smaller break radius",
    "will give a value entirely consistent with that in dbmbr .",
    "an inspection of the break radii of the 8 other high - resolution smbb profiles shows that ugc 11557 is the only case where we would claim that the choice in break radius is ambiguous .",
    "we have overplotted the distribution of slopes of the restricted smbb sample in fig .",
    "[ goodslope ] .",
    "the number of galaxies is small , so it is difficult to say anything about the intrinsic distribution of slopes , but it is clear that the smbb sample is entirely consistent with our larger restricted sample ( and even more so when the ambiguous slope for ugc 11577 is removed ) .",
    "contrary to the conclusions reached by smbb we do not find that edge - on or barred galaxies skew the distribution of slopes .",
    "a comparison between our full and restricted samples shows the inclusion or omission of edge - on galaxies does not shift the average value of the slope significantly from @xmath24 .",
    "we also note that edge - on late - type galaxies are expected to be transparent @xcite ; furthermore the h@xmath6 spectra from which the rotation curves are derived do not show the broad velocity wings expected when projection effects play a large role .",
    "conclusions regarding the importance of bars are more ambiguous as these depend on what one defines as a bar .",
    "certainly none of the galaxies investigated here contain the dominant straight bars found in earlier - type galaxies .",
    "here we are mostly dealing with magellanic - type oval components , and it is obviously a matter of judgement to decide whether one deals with an intrinsically oval component , or a projected more circular one .",
    "smbb list which of the galaxies in their sample they consider barred . in order to make a consistent barred / non - barred division of the galaxies in our restricted sample , we use their results to gauge and calibrate our classification .",
    "that any such classification remains uncertain is illustrated by the fact that none of the galaxies in the smbb sample are classified in ned as unambiguously barred ( hubble type sb ) , _ except _ ugc 2259 [ hubble type sb(s)dm ] .",
    "smbb classify this galaxy as _ unbarred _ , even though the bar with perpendicular spiral arms is easily visible on the digital sky survey image .",
    "the inner mass - density slope found for this galaxy is steep at @xmath25 . as bars are disk dynamical features ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they imply a significant disk mass .",
    "such heavy disks more than compensate for any underestimate of the slope which might be caused by the noncircular motions they induce .",
    "the minimum disk assumption fails , and with it the steep halo slopes inferred in this extreme limit .    despite this ugc 2259 discrepancy",
    ", we have used the smbb results to gauge which of the galaxies in our restricted sample should be classified as barred .",
    "we list our classification in table  1 ; we find 13 non - barred galaxies , 5 barred galaxies and 1 ambigious case .",
    "the galaxies in our restricted sample have been selected not to suffer from inclination effects or projection effects .",
    "the majority of them is unbarred , and it is not obvious at all that the presence of a bar influences any of the results .",
    "this comparison of restricted samples shows that once a proper pruning is made to only include minimum - disk , well - resolved galaxies , most of the differences are merely a matter of semantics .",
    "the observed _ shallow _ inner mass - density slopes of lsb and dwarf galaxies do therefore reflect the intrinsic properties of their potentials .",
    "in order to model the various effects that can affect rotation curves we use the full expression for the observed line - of - sight velocity at any position in a galaxy velocity field .",
    "this is given by ( see fig .  [ geometry ] ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the observed velocity at position @xmath28 , where we define the dynamical centre of the galaxy to be at @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is the systemic velocity , which is not relevant in this analysis and which will be ignored ; @xmath31 is the actual rotation curve velocity at radius @xmath32 , where @xmath32 is measured in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "@xmath33 is an expansion velocity describing non - circular motions ( which can be used to describe e.g.  streaming motions ) .",

    "following @xcite we define a coordinate system with the @xmath36 direction towards decreasing right ascension , the @xmath37 direction towards the north , and the dynamical centre as origin .",
    "position angles in the plane of the sky are measured from n towards e. the major axis of the galaxy has sky position angle @xmath38 .",
    "position @xmath28 then has position angle @xmath39 with respect to the major axis as measured in the plane of the galaxy given by :    @xmath40 @xmath41    we now introduce the angle @xmath42 which is the sky position angle of position @xmath28",
    ". we can express @xmath43 and @xmath44 as    @xmath45 @xmath46    combining this with eqs .",
    "( 2 ) gives @xmath47 @xmath48    without loss of generalisation , we can make the simplifying assumption that the major axis coincides with the @xmath49-axis , so that @xmath50 , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "equation  ( 4 ) then reduces to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we are now in a position to derive the line - of - sight velocity at any position @xmath28 , given any rotation curve @xmath53 and non - circular motion component @xmath54 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ geometry ] shows a slit positioned parallel to the major axis , but offset by an amount @xmath44 . assuming that @xmath55 everywhere , the observed line - of - sight velocities along the slit are derived by varying @xmath43 at a constant @xmath44 , for a given input @xmath31 and known @xmath35 .",
    "the radii @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be calculated , as can the position angle @xmath58 , so that @xmath39 can be derived .",
    "this then trivially gives the line - of - sight velocities .",
    "one last step we need to take , in order to `` simulate '' our ignorance regarding the systematic effects in this particular example , is to associate the positions along the slit @xmath43 ( rather than the radii @xmath34 ) with the derived line - of - sight velocities , because , as with real data , these curves will be analysed under the assumption that no systematic effects are present .",
    "other situations , including non - circular motions , can be modeled in a similar way , as shown below .      for @xmath31 we will initially investigate two halo models , apply identical systematic effects to both , and determine the resulting rotation curves and mass - density profiles .",
    "the first model is the so - called nfw halo , favoured by the cdm simulations , but seemingly not by the observations .",

    "( ii ) * _ inclination . _",
    "a random axis - ratio is chosen in the range from 0.17 to 0.76 , corresponding to inclinations between 40  and 80 .",
    "the inclination has no direct effect on the slopes , but serves as a scale factor in the error - bars determined below , and hence the uncertainty in the slopes .    *",
    "( iii ) * _ physical resolution .",
    "_ for each simulated galaxy the resolution in kpc at which it will be `` observed '' is determined as follows .",
    "figure  [ resolution ] shows the logarithmic distribution of observed resolutions ( radii @xmath7 of the innermost points of the rotation curves ) from dbmbr and dbb02 .",
    "this distribution is well approximated by a gaussian with an average @xmath84 and a dispersion @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86 spread in resolution thus varies from 0.05 kpc to 2.3 kpc , reflecting both the spread in distance as well as the mix of optical and hi  curves used .",
    "though the precise parameters of this distribution are not critical , choosing a resolution distribution that is approximately equal to the empirical one means we can make a direct comparison between the simulations and observations .",
    "* ( iv ) * _ error - bars . _ to simulate the uncertainties in the data , we de - correct the rotation curve for inclination and add error - bars .",
    "figure  [ errors ] shows the distribution of the observational uncertainties in the dbb02 data , not corrected for inclination .",

    "we have tested fitting to the innermost 2 , 4 or 5 points but this did not change any of the conclusions appreciably .",

    "it is difficult to estimate what effect the stellar disk has on the halo , but most likely the halo becomes more concentrated under the influence of the disk . in the absence of applicable models we will not explicitly simulate this , except to note that because of the dynamical insignificance of the disk the effect is likely to be small .",
    "the minimum disk assumption also gives a hard upper limit on the value of the slope , as taking into account any contribution by the stars to the mass - density slope reduces the implied dark matter slope , independent of whether any contraction has taken place or not .    *",

    "it should be noted though that the many ways in which rotation curves can be derived are all designed to remove the effects of these small - scale deviations : for example , the tilted ring procedure averages velocities over rings at a certain radius , whereas long - slit rotation curves use the independent information from radii at the approaching and receding sides of the galaxy to derive the underlying global rotation velocities .",
    "our omission of these deviations means that the uncertainties we derive in our simulations will be smaller than found in the data , but this is a small price to pay not having to introduce ill - constrained random motions that may bear no resemblance with reality .",
    "a specific example will be discussed in sect .",

    "the simulated error - bars in fig .  [ nfwisonosys ] are smaller than those of the data .",
    "as discussed in item ( vii ) in sect .",
    "[ sec : simul ] , this is most likely due to the fact that we do not simulate small - scale features in the rotation curves .",
    "this does however not affect the conclusions we can draw from the simulations .",
    "after all , when averaged over @xmath8 rotation curves , we can regard the `` bumps and wiggles '' as essentially random : they introduce scatter but are expected to average out and will not affect the shape in a systematic way .",
    "another reason not to include the small - scale deviations is that every galaxy is unique and has features in the rotation curve that depend on the positions of the hii regions , spiral arms , star formation etc . given the low star formation rates , small number of hii regions , and lack of pronounced spiral arms , it is unclear how important any of these effects are in lsb galaxies compared to `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "it is therefore difficult to derive a universally applicable description short of modeling each galaxy individually , which is clearly unfeasible .",
    "we illustrate the fact that small scale deviations most likely do not affect the conclusions , but merely introduce more scatter , by investigating a naive ( and probably too simplistic ) description for the deviations which we then apply to the simulations presented above . fig .",
    "[ smoothdata ] shows a histogram of the deviations of the raw observed rotation curves with respect to the smooth rotation curves as presented in fig .  7 of dbb02 and fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "the deviation histogram is well described by a function of the form @xmath93 .",
    "if the deviations in the rotation curves were radially uncorrelated we could add deviations derived from this distribution to our model curves , use this modified model curve to determine the underlying smooth rotation curve and subsequently measure the mass profile .",
    "however , in real galaxies the small - scale deviations are correlated : if e.g.  streaming motions along a ( resolved ) spiral arm cause a data point to lie above the average curve , then the data point next to it is more likely to lie above it as well .",
    "furthermore , the deviations are defined with respect to the underlying curve , in that the latter is derived by minimising the former .",
    "ideally , we would have to introduce an extra step in the simulations to adjust the model rotation curves to the effect of the deviations . on the other hand , as we would afterwards be fitting to the underlying curve as defined by a minimisation of deviations , and _ not _ to the raw deviations , their impact on the results would have to be significantly less than suggested by fig .  [ smoothdata ] .",
    "it is thus not clear whether taking small - scale deviations into account would have a significant effect .    as a crude attempt to show these effects ,",
    "we have applied to the two simulations described above , small - scale deviations drawn from the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ smoothdata ] . in order to introduce a degree of correlation between the deviations ,",
    "we boxcar - smooth over four data points . with real data",
    "the next step would have been to fit an underlying smooth curve by minimizing the residuals , followed by the derivation of the mass profile from the smooth curve .",
    "to determine the mass profiles we thus prefer not to use the raw data , since the mass profile derivation uses the gradient of the rotation curve .",
    "instead we introduce a bit of binning and smoothing to determine the underlying gradient . in practice",
    ", we thus have to soften the impact of the derived ( unbinned ) deviations on the simulated curves . here",
    "we ( arbitrarily ) divide them by a factor of four before adding .",
    "the number of data points to smooth over as well as this softening factor were found empirically by demanding that the error bars in the simulated slopes match those of the data .",
    "[ nfwisodeviate ] shows the results .",
    "the method has introduced scatter , but not changed the conclusions that were derived from the simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ nfwisonosys ] .",
    "it is clear that the method described above is unsatisfactory .",
    "the smoothing and softening factors are arbitrary and ill - constrained and the amount of scatter introduced depends strongly on the values one assumes for them .",
    "again , the lack of a universally applicable description of what are essentially stochastic and random processes makes this an unfeasible exercise .",
    "furthermore , as the derivation of rotation curves uses extra information such as continuity and symmetry between approaching and receding sides it is not clear whether the net impact would be significant .",
    "therefore , rather than trying to fine - tune a clearly unsatisfactory description we prefer to proceed without it , keeping in mind that there is this missing ingredient , but that it is not likely to affect the conclusions in a significant way .",
    "one of the assumptions made in rotation curve analysis is that the velocity field is symmetrical around the dynamical centre .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for all galaxies ; some seem to have a `` kinematical lopsidedness '' ( see e.g.@xcite for an extensive description ) , where the rotation curves of the approaching and receding sides each have different slopes and amplitudes ( cf .  fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the curves can differ by up to 20 per cent .",
    "interestingly , kinematical lopsidedness does not seem to automatically imply a spatial offset between optical and dynamical centres .",
    "kinematical lopsidedness can thus affect the interpretation of mass - density slopes .    here",
    "we investigate the effect of kinematical lopsidedness on the rotation curves of nfw and iso halos .",
    "we model the lopsidedness by computing a rotation curve , but choose an incorrect point of symmetry ( or incorrect systemic velocity ) .",
    "after flipping the rotation curve around this incorrect point of `` symmetry '' we thus end up with approaching and receding side curves that have different amplitudes and shapes , and therefore different inner slopes .",
    "we then proceed to take the average of the inner curves , and determine the mass - density profile .",
    "as the derived slopes are steepest when the point of symmetry is chosen correctly , this procedure will flatten the measured slopes .",
    "figure  [ kinlop ] shows an example of a `` kinematically lopsided '' nfw curve .",
    "this procedure does not take into account the observed behaviour of the curves at large radii ( see e.g.  n4395 in @xcite ; here one side of the galaxy exhibits a rising rotation curve , while at identical radii on the other side it has already flattened ) , but as our interest is in the inner slope , this will not affect any of the conclusions .",
    "we assume offsets of 0.1 , 0.5 and 1 kpc . note that though the magnitude of the effect is expressed in kpc",
    ", we do not imply that this involves a shift in dynamical centre .",
    "our notation is merely a convenient way to express the incorrect choice of systemic velocity that we use to create the kinematical lopsidedness .",
    "the offsets used here result in average in velocity offsets of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath74  respectively ( see bottom row in fig .  [ nfw_asym ] ) .",
    "we also assume that there are no additional offsets between optical and dynamical centres .",
    "figure [ nfw_asym ] shows the results for the nfw halos .",
    "we see that lopsidedness is not important as long as the effect occurs on scales smaller than the resolution",
    ". a lopsidedness of between @xmath97 and @xmath98 kpc ( which translates into an average velocity shift of @xmath99 @xmath74 ) is needed in order to bring most of the nfw points into the @xmath92 part of the diagram .",

    "estimates of the fraction of galaxies that are kinematically lopsided reach up to 30 to 50 per cent @xcite , but with much smaller velocity differences .",

    "we do not show the iso halo results : iso halos already show a slope that is slightly more positive than the data ( fig .",

    "iso halos are thus not consistent with a large ( i.e.  shift in symmetry point @xmath100 kpc ) kinematical lopsidedness .",
    "a frequently made assumption is that the visible matter in a galaxy is on circular orbits , and therefore that the measured line - of - sight velocities represent the true rotation velocity . if , however , part of the measured velocity is due to non - circular motions , it is no longer representative indicator of the mass content of a galaxy .",
    "systematic non - circular motions are most commonly observed as streaming motions along bars or spiral arms ( we do not consider local non - circular motions due to e.g.  star formation or supernovae , as explained in sect .  [",

    "the scaling does not affect the inner slopes .",
    "we show the velocity field of a kravtsov  halo in fig .",
    "[ velfikra ] .",
    "the halo parameters were chosen to give a rotation curve similar to the one used for the iso velocity field in fig .",
    "[ velfi ] .",
    "the shape of the iso - velocity contours is very similar to the iso velocity field , and do not show the `` pinching '' that the nfw iso - velocity contours show .",
    "the kravtsov  model fits the peak in the @xmath6 histogram best , but was of course constructed to do so .",
    "one feature of the data that none of the three core - dominated models can reproduce are the wings towards steeper slopes found in the data histogram .",
    "it is easy to produce shallower slopes with systematic effects , but very few effects actually will produce steeper slopes .",
    "furthermore , the `` monolithic '' nature of the models ( for each model all halos have identical slopes ) creates pronounced peaks in the histograms . in real galaxies",
    "we might expect the contributions of e.g.  the disk to differ from galaxy to galaxy , introducing a scatter in the values for the inner total mass - density slope .",
    "we test here the hypothesis that there is a small scatter in the intrinsic value of the inner slopes which is responsible for the observed wings in the data histograms .",
    "we use the kravtsov  model and add a small gaussian scatter to the slope .",
    "we choose an intrinsic dispersion in the mass - density slope @xmath173 .",
    "this choice has no physical motivation , but is simply suggested by the width of the peak in the data histogram .",
    "other more fine - tuned choices may very well be possible , our aim here is simply to describe the data in as few assumptions as possible with a simple one - component model .",
    "adding a gaussian scatter @xmath174 to the @xmath6-parameter in eq .",
    "[ eq : kravrho ] , implies modifying the @xmath153-parameter in eq .",
    "[ eq : kravrot ] with a gaussian contribution with dispersion @xmath175 .",
    "the results for the kravtsov  simulations with scatter @xmath176 are shown in fig .",
    "[ gaussscahisto ] .",
    "the peak again matches ( naturally ) .",
    "the high- and low-@xmath6 wings of the histogram fit the data better than previous models .",
    "the value for the scatter can probably be fine - tuned , and the distribution of the scatter is most likely not gaussian ( our assumptions in a small number of cases lead to hollow halos ) .",
    "the observed distributions of slopes is thus consistent with halos with inner slopes @xmath177 and no systematic effects .",
    "we have investigated the effect of systematic effects such as non - circular motions , asymmetries and lopsidedness on the values of the inner slopes of various halo models .",
    "we find that no realistic combination of a single systematic effect and nfw models can explain the observed distribution of slopes .",
    "core - dominated models , on the other hand , are consistent with the data in the absence of large systematic effects . the best match to the data is obtained by using halos with an inner mass - density slope @xmath139 and an intrinsic gaussian scatter in the slope of @xmath178 .",
    "as our models assume minimum disk , these slopes should be interpreted as those of the combined mass - profiles of stars , gas and dark matter in a galaxy .",
    "it is perhaps possible to construct a combination of multiple systematic effects to explain the data in the cdm framework .",
    "however , such a combination of effects would have to completely wipe out the strong @xmath2 peak in the @xmath6 histograms .",
    "the resulting models would be completely dominated by non - cosmological effects , and not contain any link between properties of dark matter halos and the visible galaxies that inhabit them .",
    "yet , they would have to explain and obey the tully - fisher relation , for example , and thus require a tremendous amount of fine - tuning .",
    "the implied observational signature of cdm halos is strong and if present should be easily seen .",
    "we thus conclude that the trends observed in the @xmath172 plot are mostly resolution effects , in combination with intrinsic scatter in the inner slopes .",
    "the cusp problem is certainly genuine ; it can not plausibly be attributed to systematic errors in the data .",
    "lsb galaxies have shallow mass - density slopes implying that ( i ) the current cdm model , or more precisely the current generation of n - body models based on the cdm prescription , do not correctly describe structure at the scale of galaxies , or ( ii ) non - cosmological effects destroy the cusp .",
    "the second option reduces the elegance and predictive power of the cdm model .",
