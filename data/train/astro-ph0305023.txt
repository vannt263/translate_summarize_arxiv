    "abundances of chemical elements in galaxies are commonly measured using the emission lines emitted by astrophysical nebulae ( e.g. , see osterbrock 1989 ) . recombination lines of hydrogen ( e.g. , the balmer series ) or helium and forbidden lines of singly and doubly ionized carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , neon , and sulfur are among the strongest observable lines in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "the relative strengths of each emission line , combined with some knowledge of the temperature and density of the nebulae , provide information about the relative and absolute abundances of each ion .",
    "chemical analyses of individual nebulae have been used to test nucleosynthesis models of stars , the chemical evolutionary history of galaxies , and nucleosynthesis in the big bang ( review by aller 1990 ; pagel 1998 ) .",
    "even integrated spectra of entire galaxies may be used to estimate the overall degree of chemical enrichment of a galaxy ( kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno 1998 ) .",
    "observational techniques sometimes permit the relative fluxes of emission lines from galaxies to be measured with a high degree of precision . however , in the current generation of wide - field galaxy surveys on multi - object spectrographs , flux calibration is frequently problematic due to unfavorable observing conditions or instrumental effects such as a variation in system response over the field of view . for such surveys , it is still desirable to extract chemical information from the data , where possible . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of estimating mean gas - phase oxygen abundances for galaxies based the _ equivalent widths _ ( rather than fluxes ) of strong balmer @xmath8 recombination line and forbidden [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission lines .",
    "our approach is to develop the method from basic principles , and to test and empirically calibrate it using three spectroscopic galaxy datasets , and in the end compare the oxygen abundances derived from traditional line fluxes and flux ratios to results using only the equivalent widths and equivalent width ratios .",
    "we also assess the applicability of this method to measuring abundances for a particular set of intermediate - redshift galaxies observed as part of the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) spectroscopic survey in the groth strip ( dgss ) presented in a companion paper , kobulnicky  ( 2003 ; ke03 ) .",
    "osterbrock ( 1989 ) reviews the standard techniques for measuring chemical abundances in astrophysical nebulae from the fluxes and flux ratios of nebular emission lines .",
    "the most direct and reliable techniques involve measuring a suite of temperature - sensitive and density - sensitive line ratios to determine the physical conditions of the plasma . in the absence of high signal - to - noise data measuring temperature  sensitive line ratios",
    "( e.g. , [ o  iii ]  @xmath94363/[o  iii ]  @xmath95007 ) , the default diagnostic for measuring the oxygen abundance of ionized nebulae has become the ratio of strong oxygen emission lines @xmath10 ( pagel  1979 ) .",
    "subsequently , many authors have developed formulations relating this strong line ratio to the gas - phase oxygen abundance ( e.g. , edmunds & pagel 1984 ; mccall , rybski & shields 1985 ; dopita & evans 1986 ; mcgaugh 1991 ) .",
    "other authors ( kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno 1998 ; kkp ) have shown that this approach is valid even when applied to galaxies as a whole .",
    "even when the signal to noise ratio of these lines is as low as 8:1 or when a spectroscopic observation encompasses a range of metallicities and ionization conditions within a galaxy , this ratio provides a rough , but reliable , estimate of the mean gas - phase oxygen abundance when used in conjunction with the appropriate calibration relating @xmath4 to @xmath11 . at this signal - to noise ratio ,",
    "the associated uncertainty on the oxygen abundance due to line measurement error is typically comparable to the uncertainty due to the calibration of the @xmath4 vs. o / h relationship : @xmath12 dex . in this paper",
    "we show that the uncertainty introduced by substituting emission line equivalent widths is less than these other sources of uncertainty , and thereby establish a new method for measuring interstellar medium oxygen abundances .",
    "the original @xmath4 method involves line ratios , so we consider the effects of using equivalent width ratios in place of flux ratios . for generality , we include the effects of reddening in the discussion .",
    "first , the equivalent width can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the line flux and @xmath15 is the underlying continuum flux .",
    "the fluxes do not need to be calibrated , since the calibration affects both quantities equally .",
    "the dereddened , calibrated flux value for a line , @xmath16 , or continuum , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the logarithmic attenuation at @xmath8 and @xmath20 is a function describing the reddening curve , according to the prescription of seaton ( 1979 ) . combining these leads to a general line ratio formulation of @xmath21    where we group all the continuum and reddening terms into the factor @xmath22 .",
    "note that the continuum will be attenuated by an amount characterized by @xmath23 , and reddened by ( presumably ) the same reddening law .",
    "thus , @xmath24    the factor @xmath22 contains two unknowns , the ratio of the dereddened continuum fluxes , which depends on the underlying stellar population , and the difference in the attentuation of the emitting gas and the continuum light .",
    "note that values of @xmath19 can range from 0 to quite large for individual hii regions , although large values are severely deweighted in the average over an entire galaxy .",
    "typical derived values are in the range 01 , with a median value around 0.3 ( mccall  1985 ; oloffson 1995 ) .",
    "values of @xmath23 can be estimated from the relation @xmath25 from seaton . for @xmath26 in a typical range of 00.2 , @xmath27 00.3 .",
    "we would expect some correlation of @xmath19 and @xmath23 , and also we expect ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 0 .",
    "let us now consider the specific line ratios of interest for the @xmath4 method .",
    "the first is @xmath30 } / i_{h\\beta}$ ] . for the purposes of reddening",
    ", we adopt the wavelength of the stronger [ o  iii ] @xmath95007 line .",
    "the value of @xmath22 in this case is @xmath31    due to the proximity of these emission lines in wavelength , we expect the flux ratios of the underlying stellar population to be very close to unity",
    ". similarly , for realistic @xmath32 , the reddening factor will be 1 to 0.92 .",
    "thus , for this line ratio , @xmath33 , and we will ignore it in further discussion . to a very good approximation , @xmath34 } } { i_{h\\beta } } = \\frac { w_{o[iii ] } } { w_{h\\beta } } .\\ ] ]    the second ratio , @xmath35 } / i_{h\\beta}$ ] , is more problematic ; for these lines , @xmath36 in principle , we could estimate @xmath22 from a detailed spectral analysis of the flux - calibrated , integrated stellar spectrum and balmer line ratios , but for faint , galaxies with redshifts @xmath37 we will have neither the signal - to - noise nor access to the h@xmath22 line in order to do this . in practice , we need to adopt a constant average value of @xmath22 .",
    "galaxy light tends to be dominated by a main sequence and g and k giants ( e.g. , morgan & mayall 1957 ; pritchet 1977 ; kobulnicky & gebhardt 2000 ) , and assuming an underlying stellar spectrum composed of a linear combination of these two spectral types implies that the dereddened flux ratio of the continuum ranges from @xmath381 for late - b stars to @xmath380.4 for mid - g giants to @xmath380.2 for early - k giants ( although galaxies whose @xmath93727 flux is dominated by k stars is unlikely to have any line emission from star formation ) . examining the spectra in kennicutt ( 1992b ) shows the @xmath93727-to-@xmath94861 ratio of the continuum fluxes in galaxies with obvious emission lines ranging from @xmath380.41.0 ; if these were dereddened the range would shift upwards and might possibly narrow somewhat .    on",
    "the other hand , the reddening correction ranges from 1 to 1.8 for realistic values of @xmath19 and @xmath23 , with a typical likely difference @xmath39 giving a reddening factor of @xmath381.2 . combining the two factors leads to an expected value of @xmath40 .",
    "this average value for @xmath22 differs from unity by less than 0.1 dex .",
    "we find the @xmath4 measure can now be expressed @xmath41 } + i_{[oiii ] } } { i_{h\\beta } }        = log \\frac { \\alpha w_{[oii ] } + w_{[oiii ] } } { w_{h\\beta}}.\\ ] ] not surprisingly , the @xmath4 measured using equivalent widths and a constant value of @xmath22 will be most in error when [ oii ] dominates o[iii ] .",

    "the top middle panel shows the correlation between @xmath53}/ew_{[o~ii]}$ ] and @xmath30}/i_{[o~ii]}$ ] , where @xmath78 denotes line strengths that have been corrected for reddening .",

    "the residuals of the k92 + galaxies suggest a systematic reddening overcorrection of the [ o  ii ] @xmath93727 line .",
    "the residuals for the nfgs galaxies are still systematic with galaxy color and suggest a reddening undercorrection for the reddest galaxies .",
    "the two samples have been analyzed identically , and we have no explanation for the apparent differences",
    ". a more rigorous comparison would require re - measuring all of the line strengths and equivalent widths to ensure uniform treatment of the samples .",
    "however , electronic spectra for the nfgs and kiss galaxies are not publicly available .    in figure  [ ewtest5kiss ]",
    "we show the @xmath53}/ew_{[o~ii]}$ ] versus @xmath75}/f_{[o~ii]}$ ] and @xmath30}/i_{[o~ii]}$ ] comparisons for the kiss galaxies .",
    "the residuals for both the left and center columns are @xmath80}/f_{[o~ii]})=0.15 $ ] dex and @xmath79}/i_{[o~ii]})=0.14 $ ] dex .",
    "the lack of improvement with reddening correction is undoubtedly traceable to the large , apparently random , dispersion in the [ o  ii ] line strengths and ews of the kiss spectra , as noted in previous figures .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath53}/ew_{[o~ii]}$ ] ratios could be used as a surrogate for @xmath75}/f_{[o~ii]}$ ] ratios as a indicator of the ionization parameter .",
    "the residuals are on the order of @xmath81 dex and are sometimes strongly systematic with galaxy color .",
    "the mean of the residuals varies considerably from -0.08 dex to 0.12 dex in @xmath53}/ew_{[o~ii]}$ ] depending on the galaxy sample under study .",
    "the ratios of the equivalent widths of strong oxygen and hydrogen emission lines from the ionized component of distant galaxies can be used as a measure of the global ism metallicity via the substitution of @xmath0 for @xmath4 .",
    "we recommend the use of @xmath71 where the @xmath56 has been corrected for stellar balmer absorption assuming a mean correction of 2  . the typical dispersion from the 1-to-1 relation between either @xmath0 or @xmath71 and the canonical reddening and absorption - corrected @xmath4 ratio is @xmath82 dex .",
    "residuals are somewhat smaller ( @xmath83 dex ) for galaxies with the largest emission - line equivalent widths ( i.e. , those having the largest rates of star formation per unit luminosity ) .",
    "the additional uncertainty introduced by translating a set of measured equivalent widths into the traditional @xmath4 flux ratio diagnostic is comparable to or less than the typical observational line measurement uncertainties and systematic errors in the @xmath4 to o / h calibration which run 0.15 dex in o / h ( e.g. , kobulnicky , kennicutt & pizagno 1999 for a more detailed discussion of the error budget ) .",
    "we anticipate that the method tested here will be useful for performing rough chemical abundance estimates in large high - redshift galaxy samples .",
    "the approach described here will be most useful in a statistical sense when large numbers of objects are available for study .",
    "possible applications include understanding the overall chemical evolution of star forming galaxies over large intervals of cosmic time ( kobulnicky  2003 ) or assessing the impact of cluster environment and the intracluster medium on the chemical properties of the ism within galaxies ( e.g. , skillman  1996 ) .",
