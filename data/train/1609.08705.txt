    "the low - frequency radio sky spectrum between 50 and 200  mhz is a key area of interest because experiments seeking to detect redshifted 21  cm radiation from neutral hydrogen gas during the epoch of reionization ( eor ) and earlier eras of first light and x - ray heating must subtract astrophysical foregrounds in these frequencies to high - precision . at these frequencies ,",
    "the sky is mostly dominated by galactic synchrotron radiation but also contains contributions from supernova remnants and extragalactic radio sources .",
    "there are two approaches to detecting the redshifted 21  cm signal .",
    "the first approach is targeted by interferometeric arrays , such as the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; @xcite ) , the precision array to probe the epoch of reionization ( paper ; @xcite ) , the hydrogen epoch of reionization array ( hera ; @xcite ) , the low - frequency array ( lofar ; @xcite ) , and the low - frequency aperture array component of the square kilometer array ( ska ; @xcite ) .",
    "these arrays aim to measure spatial fluctuations in the sky brightness temperature on arcminute and degree scales resulting from variations in the density , ionisation , and temperature of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) above redshift @xmath7 ( below 200  mhz ) .",
    "the second approach , on the other hand , exploits the bulk properties of the high - redshift igm that yield a global ( monopole ) contribution of redshifted 21  cm signal to the all - sky radio background .",
    "this approach is being pursued by the experiment to detect the global eor signature ( edges ; @xcite ) , broadband instrument for global hydrogen reionisation signal ( bighorns @xcite ) , sonda cosmolgica de las islas para la deteccin de hidrgeno neutro ( sci - hi @xcite ) , large - aperture experiment to detect the dark age ( leda @xcite ) , shaped antenna measurement of background radio spectrum ( saras @xcite ) , and the dark ages radio explorer ( dare ; @xcite ) .",
    "both methods require careful and accurate subtraction of the sky foreground since the 21  cm signal is three to five orders of magnitude below the foreground .",
    "although observations of the low - frequency radio sky were among the earliest in radio astronomy @xcite , detailed knowledge of the spectral properties of diffuse emission remains lacking .",
    "the @xcite all - sky map at 408  mhz , which was compiled from data taken in the 1960s and 1970s , is still the cornerstone for foreground templates extrapolated across many frequencies in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and redshifted 21  cm analyses .",
    "improvements to the map have occurred throughout the years , including efforts by @xcite , and @xcite that focused on removing point sources and destriping the original data .",
    "@xcite combined the haslam 408  mhz map and several other surveys between 10  mhz and 94  ghz to build a global sky model ( gsm ) , which provides spectral properties of the diffuse emission of the entire sky . in this model at 150 mhz , the spectral index outside the galactic plane is @xmath8 and in the galactic plane ( in a narrow band ) increases to @xmath9 with peaks as high as @xmath10 .",
    "both the haslam map and the gsm have become widely used and cited in both simulations and data reduction pipelines for redshifted 21  cm observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite created an all - sky temperature map at 45  mhz based upon the surveys of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , they produced an all - sky galactic spectral index map based upon two frequency points by using their 45  mhz and the haslam 408  mhz map after corrections for zero - level , extragalactic non - thermal emission , and cmb factors .    at higher frequencies , observations of galactic radio emission between 3 and 90 ghz",
    "have been made by the absolute radiometer for cosmology , astrophysics , and diffuse emission i and ii ( arcade i and ii ) sky surveys @xcite .",
    "this survey constrained models of extragalactic emission and suggested that models of electric dipole emission from spinning dust particles were a possible explanation for excess emission seen at 1 cm wavelengths .",
    "they find that , at most , three parameters ( reference brightness temperature , spectral index , and curvature ) are necessary to model their wide - band data combined with external radio measurements between 22 mhz and 1.4 ghz , and from wmap at 23 ghz @xcite .",
    "recently , the new redshifted 21  cm arrays have begun yielding the first large , multi - spectral maps sensitive to diffuse structures in the low - frequency sky , including recent surveys by mwa gleam @xcite and lofar @xcite .",
    "gleam will scan the entire sky south of @xmath11 between 72 and 231 mhz , and the lofar survey will scan 100 sq degrees in the northern sky centred on @xmath12 between 30 and 160 mhz .",
    "the lofar survey s primary purpose is to enable automated processing by providing an _ a priori _ sky model , which also serves as an aid to foreground removal for eor detection .",
    "similarly , gleam s survey will serve a myriad of uses , one of which again will be foreground removal in eor searches .    the edges instrument is able to provide a unique measurement of the absolute sky brightness temperature averaged over large spatial scales on the sky due to its wide beam .",
    "@xcite found that the spectral index , @xmath13 , of diffuse emission , defined as @xmath14 , was @xmath15 at high - galactic latitudes in the frequency range 100 - 200  mhz .",
    "those measurements were taken using three days of data ; two of which used a n - s orientation of the antenna s excitation axis and one with an e - w orientation . by combining their results with the haslam sky map at 408  mhz , they were able to show that @xmath16 at high galactic latitudes .",
    "in this paper we present new observations taken over a span of 240 nights from july 2015 through march 2016 with the latest version of the edges instrument that deploys an improved antenna with better chromatic performance and a new high - precision receiver calibration approach .",
    "these advancements enable us to improve on our earlier measurements of the spectral index of the diffuse low - frequency radio emission and extend our coverage to all sidereal times at a constant declination of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2",
    "we describe the instrument and calibration details . in section 3",
    "we present details of the data collected and chromatic beam corrections .",
    "section 4 presents and discusses the spectral index results and comparisons to values predicted by relevant sky models .",
    "the edges experiment is deployed at the murchison radio - astronomy observatory ( mro ) in western australia ( -26.7@xmath17 ,  + 116.6@xmath17 ) .",
    "the experiment consists of two scaled - replica instruments spanning neighboring frequency bands of 50 - 100  mhz and 90 - 190  mhz .",
    "each instrument consists of a single dipole - based antenna and receiver .",
    "extensive modeling and simulation is performed on all instrument components , along with calibration measurements conducted both in the laboratory prior to instrument deployment and on site following deployment , in order to meet the low systematic instrumental error requirements for redshifted 21  cm observations @xcite . for the results reported here",
    ", we used the high - band instrument , hence we focus our discussion on that instrument . in this section ,",
    "we review the instrument and the primary calibration steps .",
    "the high - band instrument employs a single broadband `` blade '' dipole antenna sensitive to wavelengths in the range @xmath18  m ( @xmath19  mhz ) .",
    "the antenna is ground - based and zenith pointing .",
    "the antenna consists of two rectangular planar panels that are each 63  @xmath20  48  @xmath21 and are placed 52  cm above a ground plane .",
    "the metallic ground plane is formed using a 5.35  @xmath20  5.35  m@xmath22 aluminum plate underneath the antenna , with four wire mesh extensions ( each 2  @xmath20 5  m@xmath22 ) that combine to form a `` plus '' shape .",
    "the antenna uses a roberts balun @xcite with a small shield at the bottom ( fig .",
    "[ fig : antenna_images ] ) .",
    "the blade antenna replaces the older `` fourpoint '' antenna design used in prior edges studies and yields better chromatic performance by introducing less spectral structure into the measurement @xcite .",
    "the full width at half maximum beamwidth of the antenna at 150  mhz is 72@xmath17 parallel to the axis of excitation and 110@xmath17 perpendicular to the axis .",
    "the features of the antenna are summarized in table  [ tab : antennas ] .",
    "the antenna is connected to a receiver placed underneath the ground plane in a temperature - regulated enclosure kept at @xmath23c .",
    "the receiver amplifies and conditions the signal before passing it through a 100  m cable to a backend unit that further amplifies it and sends it to a pc - based 14-bit 400-ms / s analog to digital converter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : block_diagram ] ) . blocks of 65536 voltage samples are then fourier transformed to obtain spectra of 32768 points below 200  mhz with 6.1  khz resolution .",
    "the receiver utilizes laboratory calibration prior to deployment , augmented with a three - position hot / cold / antenna calibration switching scheme for stability in the frontend during operation , to achieve an absolute accuracy of @xmath24% in measured antenna temperature @xcite .",
    "the calibration quantities are measured as a function of both temperature and frequency .",
    "the impedance match of the antenna can be measured _ in situ _ by switching a vector network analyzer ( vna ) into the electrical path .    to propagate the calibration to the sky temperature measurement",
    ", we must apply several corrections for losses that occur in the antenna before the receiver .",
    "the losses include ground plane loss , balun loss , and antenna panel loss .",
    "we also make an estimate and correct for the actual temperature of the low - noise amplifier ( lna ) which may deviate from the nominal 25@xmath17c due to temperature gradients .",
    "ground plane loss originates from our finite ground plane , allowing a small amount of signal ( @xmath25 ) from below the horizon to be received from the antenna .",
    "these losses are modeled through cst ( computer simulation technology ) microwave studio and through feko ( feldberechnung fr kper mit beliebiger oberflche ) e&m simulations .",
    "the balun loss is due to minor resistive impedance in the brass and copper - plated balun hardware and also to the resistivity and dielectric properties of the connector to the receiver .",
    "this effect is estimated from analytical models .",

    "we measured the sky temperature using edges over a period of 240 days starting with day 207 ( july 26 ) of 2015 .",
    "we determined the spectral index by fitting the calibrated data to the two parameter equation @xmath28 where the two fitting parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath29 , are the spectral index and the brightness temperature at 150  mhz less @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the cmb temperature , @xmath30 , is 2.725  k , and @xmath31 is 150  mhz .",
    "we find that this equation yields lower rms fitting errors than the log form of the equation : @xmath32    data collection was occasionally interrupted due to a variety of factors such as power outages and inclement weather ( table  [ tab : missing_data ] ) .",
    "we exclude daytime data since effects from the sun and the ionosphere @xcite can interfere with the observation of the astronomical sky foreground .",
    "sporadic data points affected by radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) are flagged and excised .",
    "the data are averaged and binned into 72  timeslots of 20  minutes in lst and into 250 frequency bins of 400  khz from 90  to 190  mhz .    for an antenna on the surface of the earth pointed toward zenith , the pointing declination of its primary axis corresponds to the latitude of the antenna s deployment site , and the pointing right ascension corresponds to the lst at the site . as the earth rotates , the antenna pointing changes direction , altering the mapping of its beam pattern onto sky coordinates . because the antenna s beamwidth is wide by design , we sample the average sky temperature weighted by the beam ( see figs .

    "s ionosphere can distort the appearance of the astronomical sky and , in principle , provide an additional chromatic effect .",
    "@xcite used the lofar low frequency antenna beam to evaluate the chromatic effects of the ionosphere , in particular due to refraction . to minimize these effects , we restrict our data analysis to times when ionospheric perturbations are minimal by excluding data when the sun s elevation is -10@xmath27 or higher .",

    "however , as shown in @xcite , realistic antennas suffer chromatic ( frequency - dependent ) effects that couple angular structure in the sky to spectral structure in the measurement .",
    "thus , before we can analyze the spectral properties of the radio sky to high - precision , we must correct for the chromatic effects of the edges antenna .",
    "[ fig : beam_width ] shows a snapshot of the beam s directivity at 150  mhz projected upon the haslam sky map when located at -26.7 latitude and pointed towards the zenith at lst  =  13  h. when the directivity of the beam changes at other frequencies , affected locations in the sky will contribute stronger or weaker to the antenna temperature .",
    "these chromatic beam effects are significant especially with the galactic centre overhead where the rms fitting errors to a two parameter equation can exceed 9  k for an uncorrected spectrum .",
    "@xcite chose to report the spectral index using a region in the sky which would minimize chromatic beam effects and chose lst  =  2.5  h. fig .",
    "[ fig : galactic_beams ] shows that this is true for the present blade beam , but even in this region , beam effects must be taken into account .",

    ", we use simulated beam maps , along with a sky model , to generate a chromaticity correction factor for the beam , which can reduce the rms fitting errors to under 5  k. we model the antenna from 90  to  190  mhz in steps of 1  mhz with numerical time - domain electromagnetic simulations using cst microwave studio .",
    "we then use these beam models , along with the haslam 408 mhz map , to compute a correction factor as a function of frequency for each lst in our observations . to scale the haslam map from 408  mhz to our frequency range",
    ", we first subtract the @xmath33 temperature from the map , scale its brightness temperature to 150 mhz using a constant spectral index of @xmath34 and then add @xmath33 back in . we convolve the scaled haslam map with the beam directivity at each frequency modeled .",
    "the beam factor ratio is formed by dividing the modeled antenna temperature at each frequency by the antenna temperature at 150  mhz .",
    "we implicitly assume that the spectral index does not vary significantly from its value at 150 mhz in our frequency range of 90   to 190  mhz .",

    "the antenna losses arise from the balun resistance , the connection to the receiver , and the resistance of the antenna panels .",

    "there is a very minor effect on @xmath1 from the panel resistance of 0.001 .",
    "when we use cst and feko to compute the beam correction factor , the difference in the spectral index between methods is 0.016 .",
    "this considers different choices of including or subtracting the cmb as well as different scalings of the haslam 408  mhz map to 150  mhz assuming realistic spectral indices . to assess the impact of spatial variations in the spectral index on our beam correction factor",

    "the effect upon the spectral index causes a difference of @xmath510.003 for all lst values except from 20 to 23 h where it rises to + 0.005 .",
    "hence , the main component of chromaticity originates from the beam and not spectral index spatial variations .",
    "we now combine the sources of systematic uncertainty .",

    "as opposed to in quadrature , the total maximum uncertainty in @xmath1 becomes 0.015 .",

    "we then fit the simulated antenna temperature to equation  ( [ eq : power_law_1 ] ) to obtain the spectral index vs. lst .",

    "the guzmn - haslam ( gh ) derived spectral indices , on the other hand , are a closer match .",
    "the gh indices only differ from our measurements by 0.01  <  @xmath6  <  0.05 ( 1  to  3  sigma ) away from the galactic centre and agree well at 18 h lst .",
    "one possible cause for the better agreement to the data by the gh model compared to the gsm is the higher sky temperatures reported in the guzmn map as compared to the gsm at 45 mhz .",
    "away from the galactic centre , the guzmn map is 1100 k higher than the gsm in much of the sky . if the gsm had higher temperatures away from the galactic centre , the simulated spectral index using the gsm maps would decrease for the lower values of lst , giving better agreement with our measurements .",
    "based on these results , we caution that the gsm likely under - predicts the sky temperature at high - galactic latitudes below 200 mhz .",
    "if we make a direct comparison against @xcite where their edges - only spectral index result was @xmath62 at lst  =  2.5  h , we report @xmath63 , which is consistent with the 2008 results . to compare against their @xmath64 value , we must use our @xmath29 measurement values at lst  =  2.5  h coupled with the @xmath65 values as computed using the haslam sky map with our antenna beam . in this case , we compute @xmath66 as compared to their result of @xmath67 .",
    "the disagreement in these two values arise from differences in @xmath65 and @xmath29 values .",
    "@xmath65 values differ by 0.7 k , which is most likely due to different antenna beam models in use ( due to different antenna designs ) and results in 33  % of the disagreement .",
    "@xmath29 values differ by twice the 2008 stated uncertainty in @xmath29 ( @xmath40  =  10  k ) , which we believe is due to accuracy of the @xcite measurement and accounts for the remainder of the difference .",
    "we measured the sky brightness temperature as a function of frequency and derived the spectral index @xmath1 as a function of sidereal time by fitting to a two parameter model over a span of 240 days using 211 days of nighttime data acquired from july 2015 to march 2016 .",
    "instrument calibration , including corrections for temperature gradients , ground loss , antenna losses , and beam chromaticity , has been applied to deliver instrument stability of over several months as demonstrated by spectral index standard deviation values @xmath68  0.003 .",
    "we have presented results of extensive measurements of the diffuse radio sky between the frequencies of 90 - 190  mhz .",
    "we find that the spectral index @xmath1 is in the range @xmath2  0.02 in the lower lst values , but increases to @xmath43 with the galaxy overhead .",
    "the gsm tends to over - predict the strength of the variation in the spectral index in the range 0.05  <  @xmath6  <  0.12 for low lst . however , comparison with the spectral index as computed using the guzmn sky map at 45 mhz and the haslam sky map at 408 mhz is a closer match and differs by 0.01  <  @xmath6  <  0.05 away from the centre . at the galactic centre",
    "both models agree with our measurements of the spectral index to within one sigma .",
    "future work is planned to investigate the criteria needed to fit to a three - parameter spectral equation .",
    "updates to sky models will be used to simulate spectral index across lst using the edges blade antenna .",
    "we also plan to measure the spectral index in the @xmath69  mhz range with the low - band edges blade antenna .",
