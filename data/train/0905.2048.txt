    "evolution partial differential equations ( pde ) for vector fields under the divergence - free constraint appear in many physical models .",
    "similar problems are to be solved with second - rank tensor fields . in most of these equations ,",
    "if the initial data and boundary conditions satisfy the divergence - free condition , then the solution on a given time interval is divergence - free too .",
    "but from the numerical point of view , things can be more complicated and round - off errors can create undesired solutions , which may then trigger growing unphysical modes .",
    "therefore , in the case of vector fields , several methods for the numerical solution of such pdes have been devised , such as the constraint transport method  @xcite or the toroidal - poloidal decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a new method for the case of symmetric tensor fields , which appear in general relativity within the so - called 3 + 1 approach  @xcite , keeping in mind the vector case for which the method can be closely related to the toroidal - poloidal approach .",

    "the magnetic field is known to be divergence - free since maxwell s equations .",
    "this result can be extended to general relativistic electrodynamics as well . in classical hydrodynamics ,",
    "the continuity equation can be expressed as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass density of the fluid , and @xmath2 its velocity .",
    "various approximations give rise to divergence - free vectors .",
    "incompressible fluids have constant density along flow lines and therefore verify that their velocity field @xmath2 is divergence - free .",
    "water is probably the most common example of an incompressible fluid . in an astrophysical context",
    ", the incompressible approximation can lead to a pretty good approximation of the behavior of compressible fluid provided that the flow s mach number is much smaller than unity .",
    "another useful hydrodynamic approximation is the anelastic approximation , which essentially consists in filtering out the sound waves , whose extremely short time scale would otherwise force the use of an impractically small time step for numerical purposes . in general - relativistic magneto - hydrodynamics ,",
    "the anelastic approximation takes the form @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the coordinate fluid velocity , @xmath4 the lorentz factor of the fluid , and @xmath1 its rest - mass density .",
    "divergence - free vectors have given rise to a large literature in numerical simulations .",
    "for example , while using an induction equation to numerically evolve a magnetic field , there is no guarantee that the divergence of the updated magnetic field is numerically conserved .",
    "the most common methods to conserve divergences in hyperbolic systems are constrained transport methods , projection methods or hyperbolic divergence cleaning methods ( see @xcite for a review ) .      the basic formalism of general relativity uses four - dimensional objects and , in particular , symmetric four - tensors as the metric or the stress - energy tensor . a choice of the gauge , which comes naturally to describe the propagation of gravitational waves is the _ harmonic gauge _",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , for which the divergence of the four - metric is zero .",
    "the 3 + 1 formalism ( see @xcite for a review ) is an approach to general relativity introducing a slicing of the four - dimensional spacetime by three - dimensional spacelike surfaces , which have a riemannian induced three - metric . with this formalism",
    ", the four - dimensional tensors of general relativity are projected onto these three - surfaces as three - dimensional tensors .",
    "consequently , the choice of the gauge on the three - surface is a major issue for the computation of the solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "the divergence - free condition on the conformal three - metric has already been put forward by dirac  @xcite in cartesian coordinates , and generalized to any type of coordinates in  @xcite .",
    "this conformal three - metric obeys an evolution equation which can be cast into a wave - like propagation equation .",
    "far from any strong source of gravitational field , this evolution equation tends to a tensor wave equation , under the gauge constraint . with the choice of the generalized dirac gauge this translates into the system we study in sec .",
    "[ s : sym_tensor ] , with the addition of one extra constraint : the fact that the determinant of the conformal metric must be one ( eq .  ( 167 ) of @xcite ) .    the choice of spherical coordinates and components comes naturally with the study of isolated spheroidal objects as relativistic stars or black holes . moreover , boundary conditions for the metric or for the hydrodynamics equations can be better expressed and implemented using tensor or vector components in the spherical basis . the numerical simulations of astrophysically relevant objects in general relativity must therefore be able to deal with the evolution of divergence - free symmetric tensors , in spherical coordinates and components .",
    "a particular care must be given to the fulfillment of the divergence - free condition , since this additional constraint sets the spatial gauge on the spacetime .",

    "in the rest of this section , we devise a method to verify both equations ( [ e : vec_wave ] ) and ( [ e : vec_div_condition ] ) .",
    "this technique is similar to that presented in  @xcite with the difference that we motivate it by the use of vector spherical harmonics , and can easily be related to the poloidal - toroidal decomposition method , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ ss : pol_tor ] .",
    "the first step is to decompose the angular dependence of the vector field @xmath23 onto a basis of _ pure spin vector harmonics _ ( see  @xcite for a review ) : @xmath35 defined from the scalar spherical harmonics as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gradient in the orthonormal basis  ( [ e : spher_triad ] ) .",

    "thus , if the fields are defined on the whole sphere @xmath49,\\ \\ph \\in [ 0 , 2\\pi)$ ] , it is possible to transform the usual components @xmath50 to the pure spin ones @xmath51 by this one - to - one transformation , up to a constant ( @xmath52 part ) for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since this constant is not relevant , it shall be set to zero and disregarded in the following .",
    "therefore , a vector field shall be represented equivalently by its usual spherical components or by @xmath53 .      from the vector spherical harmonic decomposition ,",
    "we now compute two scalar fields that represent the divergence - free degrees of freedom of a vector .",
    "we start from the divergence of a general vector @xmath54 , expressed in terms of pure spin components : @xmath55 where @xmath56 has been computed for the vector @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ e : etasolve ] ) .",
    "this shows that the divergence of @xmath54 does not depend on the pure spin component @xmath57 . on the other hand ,",

    "next , taking the curl of @xmath54 and , in particular , combining the @xmath15- and @xmath16- components of this curl , one has that @xmath62 has the same property of being invariant under the addition of any gradient field to @xmath54 , thus depends only on @xmath61 .",

    "it must also be emphasized that the divergence - free condition is not enforced in terms of spherical components ( eq .  ( [ e : vec_div ] ) ) , but in terms of pure spin components .",

    "<S> the full vector / tensor field is recovered at each time - step from these two ( in the vector case ) , or three ( symmetric tensor case ) scalar fields , through the solution of a first - order system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) for each spherical harmonic . </S>",
