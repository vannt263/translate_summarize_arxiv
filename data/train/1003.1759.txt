    "in the standard model of low - mass star formation , a molecular cloud core collapses to a protostar over timescales of @xmath1  yr ( e.g. , shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) , consistent with observations ( kenyon et al .",
    "1990 ; enoch et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , steady accretion of this mass onto central stars with a plausible mass - radius relationresults in accretion luminosities that are larger than those observed in low - mass protostars ( kenyon et al .  1990 , 1994 ;",
    "enoch et al .",
    "one solution to this `` luminosity problem '' is that most infalling matter first falls to the circumstellar disk and then is accreted to the star during short - lived outbursts ; in this model protostars are usually observed in quiescence .",
    "the fu orionis objects provide direct evidence for this type of behavior , with maximum accretion rates of @xmath2 over periods of decades to centuries ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) , which also directly suggests @xmath310@xmath4 m@xmath5 in the disk at @xmath3 1 au .",
    "a number of theories have been proposed to explain fu orionis outbursts , including thermal instability in the inner disk ( bell @xmath6 lin 1994 ) , binary interactions @xcite , and gravitational clumping at several au ( vorobyov @xmath6 basu 2005 , 2006 ) . in a recent paper ( z2009a )",
    ", we explored the possibility that outbursts might result because of a mismatch between the mass fluxes that can be transported by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in the inner disk , and the gravitational instability ( gi ) in the outer disk . using steady thin disk theory",
    ", we argued that outbursts are to be expected when disks are driven by mass addition lower than 10@xmath7 , as initially found by armitage , livio , & pringle ( 2001 ) .",
    "we then developed a two - dimensional model of fu orionis disks , which verified that outbursts of accretion similar to those observed could be produced using reasonable parameters for mri transport when thermal ionization dominates ( z2009 b ) .",
    "the computationally - intensive nature of two - dimensional ( let alone three - dimensional ) simulations of outbursts makes it difficult to conduct studies of the effects of differing parameters on disk evolution over significant timescales .",
    "we have therefore developed one - dimensional disk models to follow disk evolution .",
    "while such models have limitations , they can serve as a starting point to investigate the landscape of possible disk evolutionary pathways .",
    "the diversity of disk properties among stars of nearly the same age and mass ( e.g. , hartmann 2009 ) is plausibly the result of differing initial conditions , and models of the type we explore here can begin to address this possibility .    in  2",
    "we describe our 1-d , two - zone model , and compare its outburst properties with our 2-d models in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present the results of a parameter study designed to show when outbursts occur and how the outburst strength and frequency depend on the adopted parameters .",
    "we present our discussion and conclusions in  5 and  6 . the present work ,",
    "in which we assume constant mass addition to the outer disk , serves as a starting point for our subsequent investigation of long - term disk evolution with mass addition due to infall from a rotating protostellar envelope in a following paper .",
    "in this paper we adopt a version of the `` layered accretion '' disk model originally put forward by gammie ( 1996 ) . in this model , unless the disk is warm enough that thermal ionization is sufficient to couple the magnetic field effectively to the neutral disk material , only an upper layer of the disk can sustain the mri due to non - thermal ionization by cosmic and/or x - rays . a significant amount of work has been done to study the properties of the active layer ( e.g. sano et al .  2000 ,",
    "turner & sano 2008 , bai & goodman 2009 ) , however due to the complex physics and chemistry involved , further theoretical or even observation study is needed . here",
    ", we assume that the mass column density which can be ionized is roughly constant with radius ( see , e.g. , glassgold , najita & igea 2004 ) .",
    "if the total disk surface density @xmath8 in the `` cold '' regions is less than the limiting active layer column density @xmath9 , the disk is assumed to be completely viscous with a given @xmath10 viscosity parameter due to mri activity . on the other hand ,",
    "if the disk surface density is higher than this limit , then only the surface layers are assumed to exhibit the mri .",
    "our one - dimensional , two - zone models ( 1d2z ) thus in general exhibit two layers : the surface layer and the central or `` dead '' zone with surface density @xmath11 . the dead zone is assumed to have little or no mri activity , though it may exhibit transport due to gi ( see below ) .",
    "the temperatures t@xmath12 and t@xmath13 are averages which characterize the corresponding layers .",
    "the surface density evolves according to the mass conservation and angular momentum conservation equations , @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radial mass flux in the disk , the stress @xmath17 , and subscript @xmath18 denotes either a ( active layer ) or d ( dead zone ) .",
    "assuming keplerian rotation , equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) can be simplified to @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the constant infall rate @xmath21 is set as an inflow outer boundary condition with @xmath21=10@xmath22 , 10@xmath23 , and 10@xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is the maximum non - thermally ionized surface density , assumed constant during each calculation . if at a given timestep @xmath27",
    ", the excess mass of the active layer ( @xmath28-@xmath26 ) is added to the dead zone ( @xmath29=@xmath29+@xmath28-@xmath26 ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , part of the dead zone is assumed to be non - thermally ionized , in which case @xmath28 is set to be @xmath26 and @xmath29 decreases to @xmath32 . setting @xmath33 is a crude approximation ; it is likely that @xmath26 varies with radius and depends on the local abundance of dust and flux of ionizing radiation .",
    "the temperatures are determined by the balance between the heating and radiative cooling , @xmath34 where the heat capacity is @xmath35=@xmath36 . for the active layer ,",
    "the cooling rate is determined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath39 represents the irradiation from the central star , and @xmath40 is the optical depth of the active layer .",
    "the final factor in equation ( [ eq : qcool ] ) is an approximate form which accommodates both optically thin and thick cooling .",
    "we assume @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total luminosity of the star and @xmath43 accounts for the non - normal irradiation of the disk by the central star ; here we set @xmath44 .",
    "the active layer optical depth is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the rosseland opacity derived from z2009a at the active layer density and temperature , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the scale height of the active layer and the dead zone .",
    "the dead zone has a cooling rate similar to that of the active layer .",
    "if the active layer is optically thick , the incident radiation flux into the dead zone from the active layer is @xmath38t@xmath51 .",
    "thus the cooling rate is @xmath52 with @xmath53 however , if the active layer is optically thin , the incident flux becomes @xmath38(t@xmath51@xmath40+t@xmath54 ) , and @xmath55 with increasing temperature the radiative cooling time , which constrains the numerical timestep , becomes small . for computational efficiency",
    "we then make the equilibrium approximation @xmath56 when the disk midplane temperature is @xmath57k .",
    "the heating rate of the dead zone is just the viscous heating rate , while , in the active layer , the heating rate consists of its own viscous heating and the radiation from the underlying dead zone : @xmath58 in the case when the active layer is optically thin , this equation is modified to @xmath59    the viscous heating term is @xmath60 where @xmath61 . to evaluate the viscosity @xmath62 , we have considered both mri and gi transport . the net viscosity @xmath62 is the sum of both , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 the mri viscosity is assumed to have a fixed value of @xmath10 whether the region in question is thermally or non - thermally ionized .",
    "we assume that above some critical temperature @xmath66 the mri is fully activated throughout the disk with viscosity parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the toomre instability parameter @xmath68 is evaluated using the disk central ( midplane ) temperature t@xmath13 , the total surface density ( @xmath28+@xmath29 ) , and assuming keplerian rotation .",
    "the form of @xmath69 is motivated by a desire to make gravitational torques significant only when @xmath70 , as indicated by global three - dimensional simulations ( e.g. , boley et al 2006 ) .",
    "there are uncertainties in adopting the above approach to transport .",
    "gis involve large scale density waves that can not be captured with a local viscous treatment , although local treatments are adequate under some circumstances @xcite . as discussed in z2009a , the essential properties of this treatment are the assumptions that disks with gi have @xmath68-values of order unity , and that the gi produce local dissipation of the accretion energy .",
    "under these assumptions , the precise form of @xmath71 will not affect the disk s evolution , as long as @xmath0 is a steeply declining function of q near @xmath31.5 . to make this point clear , we ran the same simulation for a test case but with the @xmath71 prescription of lin & pringle ( 1987,1990 ) .",
    "as expected , the different forms of @xmath71 have no effect on the disk outbursts .",
    "similarly , whether the mri can be fully activated in a non - thermally - ionized layer depends in part upon whether small dust grains have been sufficiently depleted ( e.g. , sano et al .",
    "this is a complicated problem with substantial observational and theoretical uncertainties ; we therefore adopt the simplest possible approach .",
    "it turns out that the value of @xmath9 is unimportant for understanding large outbursts ( z2009a ) , as long as the gi in the dead zone transports more mass than the active layer ; but @xmath28 does have important effects on the long - term disk evolution at low accretion rates , as discussed in a following paper .",
    "it is now clear that the magnetic fields that give rise to @xmath10 diffuse radially ( lesur & longaretti 2008 , guan & gammie 2009 , fromang & stone 2009 ) and take time to build up and decay ( e.g. hirose et al .",
    "2009 ) . to account for these effects",
    "we introduce an evolution equation for @xmath10 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the equilibrium value for @xmath10 .",
    "the first term permits @xmath10 to relax up , or down , as @xmath74 is crossed .",
    "the second term corresponds to radial diffusion of the magnetic field . for numerical reasons we set the dimensionless radial diffusion coefficient to @xmath75",
    "( the radial diffusion coefficient is actually a function of distance from the midplane ) .",
    "in the protostellar phase , the disk is unlikely to transport mass steadily from @xmath3100 au all the way to the star at an accretion rate matching the mass infall rate @xmath76 from the envelope to the outer disk .",
    "this mismatch leads to outbursts which are qualitatively similar to that found by @xcite , book & hartmann ( 2005 ) , and in our 2-d hydrodynamic simulations ( z2009b ) . in summary , before the outburst , mass added to the outer disk moves inwards due to gi , but piles up in the inner disk as gi becomes less effective at smaller radii . eventually , the large @xmath8 and energy dissipation leads to enough thermal ionization to trigger the mri at several au .",
    "the mri front quickly moves in across the inner disk and the inner disk accretes at a higher mass accretion rate , resembling fu orionis - type outbursts .",
    "this high mass accretion rate during the outburst also makes the inner disk thermally unstable .",
    "after the inner disk has been drained by the outburst and becomes too cold to sustain the mri , the disk returns to the low state .",
    "with the mass continuously accreted from the outer radii ( or from an infalling envelope ) , the disk evolves to conditions leading to another outburst .",
    "this mri triggered by gi outburst can also be understood as the classical thermal instability , but the s - curve is formed primarily by the variation of @xmath0 near t@xmath77 , rather than variations in opacity and assumed variation in @xmath0 near hydrogen ionization ( e.g. @xcite ) .    to test how 1d2z models simulate the outbursts compared with 2-d simulations",
    ", we set up a test case with all the parameters adopted from our previous 2-d simulations ( z2009b ) . in both 1-d and 2-d simulations , we have used an updated opacity from z2009a and t@xmath77=1500 k . because z2009b do not consider irradiation , the irradiation factor f in equation ( [ eq : text ] ) for the 1d2z simulation is set to be 0 .",
    "the inner radius in both cases is set to 0.2 au .",
    "figure [ fig : dmcompare ] shows the mass accretion rate as a function of time for both 1-d and 2-d simulations . as shown , the 1-d simulations closely resemble 2-d simulations at the equilibrium states , such as the state before the outburst is triggered and the state during the outburst . for some rapid , or small scale , disk variations , such as the mri front propagation and the convective eddies in the hot inner disks , the 2-d simulations exhibit more complex behavior than the 1-d simulations , so the outbursts differ in detail .",
    "in particular the 1-d simulations show an initial high @xmath78 peak at the beginning of the outburst that is not seen in 2-d .",
    "the 1-d simulations also show `` drop outs '' in accretion that do not occur in 2-d .    in detail , starting from the mri activation at @xmath32 au , the mri active region moves inwards . during this process , mass piles up at the inner boundary of the active region , because the disk is mri active beyond this boundary and has a higher mass accretion rate than the mri inactive disk at smaller radius . in 1-d simulations , which do not capture the effects of radial pressure gradients , mass piles up at this boundary .",
    "when this mass eventually accretes on to the central star there is a sharp peak in @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath78 drop - outs during outbursts in the 1-d simulations are related to the thermal instability associated with hydrogen ionization .",
    "the drop - outs occur when the inner disk returns to the ti low state in 1-d ; in 2-d radial and vertical convection smooths out variations in the accretion rate and allows the inner disk to remain in the high state .    despite the initial @xmath78 peak and",
    "the drop - outs in the 1-d model , the outburst timescale , @xmath78 , and consequently the total mass accreted during one outburst are similar in 1-d and 2-d simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmcompare ] ) .",
    "this similarity is due to the fact that the outburst timescale and @xmath78 are just determined by the radius where the mri is triggered and by @xmath67 ; the total mass accreted during one outburst is the mass difference before and after the outbursts , which are both equilibrium states .",
    "having tested that the 1-d models reproduce the general properties of the outbursts ( maximum @xmath78 , duration time , etc . ) , we next turn to a parameter study with 1-d models to test the predictions of z2009a using steady state models .",
    "the radial range considered is from @xmath30.2 au to 30 au .",
    "we adopt a constant inflow boundary condition at 30 au . the inner boundary 0.2 - 0.3 au",
    "is chosen to avoid instabilities which occur at the smallest radius where there is a transition between thermal and non - thermal activation of the mri , here called @xmath79 .",
    "we find that , at least for our phenomenological model , @xmath79 is unstable .",
    "@xcite has also found even with a 2-d radiative transfer hydrodynamic layered model , this instability still occurs . @xmath80",
    "oscillates around a mean radius , with thermal fronts washing inward and outward .",
    "this is similar to thermal instability but due to @xmath0 variations between the dead zone and the inner mri active region @xcite .",
    "however , we should be cautious in this instability , especially since dust may be sublimated before mri activation .",
    "then the inner disk may become optically thin due to the low opacity of the gas , and direct irradiation from the central star would ionize the dust wall .",
    "a proper treatment of @xmath79 needs a 3-d mhd simulation with irradiation , dust physics , and ionization physics .",
    "because this treatment is impractical , we set the inner boundary of our model just outside @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath79 depends on a variety of parameters ( central star luminosity , the irradiation angle to the disk s surface , active layer surface density , the mri trigger temperature and its viscosity parameter ) .",
    "generally , @xmath79 increases as the heating rate increases .",
    "in the end we set the inner boundary to @xmath81au if @xmath67=0.01 and 0.3 au if @xmath67=0.1 .",
    "the infall is treated as a constant mass inflow at the disk outer edge at 30 au .",
    "this assumption may not be applicable to study the disk s long - term evolution during the entire infall stage ( 10@xmath82 years ) since the infall centrifugal radius increases with time ; this is explored extensively in paper ii ( zhu et al .",
    "2010b ) . over the timescale of a single outburst ,",
    "as studied in this paper , this assumption is a good approximation as long as the infall centrifugal radius is larger than the mri stable radius ( r@xmath77  1 - 10 au in figure [ fig : m1 ] ) .",
    "because protostars are thought to form over @xmath3 few @xmath83 yr , the average infall rate should be 10@xmath24 - 10@xmath84 ( stahler 1988 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1997 ) ; numerical simulations suggest the infall rate could be up to 10@xmath7 at the earliest stages ( bate et al .",
    "thus we study the disk evolution with infall rates varying from 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath85 .",
    "we neglect any change in the central star mass over the outburst timescale , which is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the effect of changing central mass over longer evolutionary timescales is included in paper ii .",

    "2009 , shi et al . 2009 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) . because the situation is not yet resolved",
    ", we will consider cases with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the mri activation temperature @xmath66 is not known precisely ( it depends on the location of alkali metals , their ionization rate , the abundance of small grains , and the threshold ionization fraction for mri turbulence ) , so we consider cases with @xmath66=1400 k and 1800 k. these values are chosen , consistent with our opacity prescription , to represent cases with and without dust .",
    "figures [ fig:1em4 ]  [ fig:1em62 ] show the outbursts with different infall rates varying from 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath85 . for a given set of disk parameters ( @xmath67 , t@xmath77 )",
    ", the disk accretes quasi - steadily if the infall rate is high enough ( small variations could still appear due to the classical thermal instability , as discussed in  5.1 ) .",
    "if @xmath91 , the disk accretes steadily if the infall rate is @xmath92 , while outbursts appear with smaller infall rates . with a bigger @xmath93 , the disk accretes nonsteadily / in outburst for all the cases with infall rates @xmath92-@xmath94",
    "this is consistent with our predictions from the steady state models ( z2009a ) .",
    "the outbursts become shorter with smaller infall rates @xmath21 . for example , with @xmath67=0.1 and t@xmath77=1400 k , the outbursts last 800 , 500 , and 400 years for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the mri is triggered at larger radii with larger @xmath21 and thus the outburst ( viscous ) timescale is longer (  5.1 ) . the simple analytical calculation in the appendix shows that the outburst timescale is @xmath98 for t@xmath77=1400 k , where @xmath99 is the gi - induced mri activation radius which will be discussed in  5 .",
    "this agrees with the numerical simulations reasonably well .",
    "the mass accretion rates during the outbursts are similar .",
    "the infall rate also determines the outburst frequency .",
    "the time between two outbursts is significantly shorter with @xmath100 than with@xmath101 , because the mass accreted to the star during all the outbursts should be equal to the mass from infall integrated over the same period of time . since the outburst timescale is insensitive to the infall rate ( @xmath102 )",
    ", we assume each outburst transports @xmath103 , which is suggested by the observation of fu ori , and thus the timescale between two outbursts is 0.03 m@xmath5/@xmath21 .",
    "therefore higher infall rates lead to more frequent outbursts .",
    "the effect of @xmath67 on the outburst can be seen by comparing the upper and lower panels of figures [ fig:1em4]-[fig:1em62 ] . for a given @xmath21 and @xmath66 , with a higher @xmath67",
    "the outburst is shorter and stronger .",
    "this is because the outburst timescale is close to the viscous timescale , which is inversely proportional to @xmath67 while the mass accretion rate is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "this can be understood using equation ( [ eq : timescale ] ) and @xmath104 as shown in the appendix for the @xmath66=1400 k case .",
    "on the other hand , comparing the left and right panels of figures [ fig:1em4 ] - [ fig:1em62 ] , we find that the disks with higher @xmath66 have shorter but stronger outbursts .",
    "the outburst is shorter because the mri is triggered at a smaller radius if @xmath66 is higher , resulting in a shorter viscous timescale .",
    "figure [ fig:14001800 ] shows the disk s condition just before the mri is triggered in the case @xmath66=1400 k ( the solid curve ) and @xmath66=1800 k ( the dotted curve ) .",
    "the mri is triggered at 3 au with @xmath66=1400 k and 1.5 au with @xmath66=1800 k. the outburst is stronger with higher t@xmath77 because the surface density at the mri trigger radius with @xmath66=1800 k ( 1 au ) is much higher than the surface density at the mri trigger radius with @xmath66=1400 k ( 3 au ) ( upper left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig:14001800 ] ) .",
    "thus , with higher t@xmath77 , the smaller but more massive inner disk leads to shorter but stronger outbursts .    our simulations also indicate that the outbursts with higher @xmath66 accrete less mass than those with lower @xmath66 no matter what the infall rate is ( table 1 ) , because the outbursting inner disk extends to smaller radii , and thus contains less mass , for a higher @xmath66 .",
    "protostars have a variety of masses , most of which are less than 1 m@xmath5 .",
    "we also calculated results for central star masses ( 0.3 , and 0.1 m@xmath5 ) with the same t@xmath77 ( 1400 k ) and @xmath67=0.1 , and the infall rate @xmath101 .",
    "the mass accretion rates with time for these cases are shown in figure [ fig : difmass ] .",
    "the outbursts have similar mass accretion rates , but the outburst is slightly shorter with a less massive central star , as suggested by equation ( [ eq : timescale ] ) .",
    "in addition the mass accreted during an outburst is not significantly affected by its central star mass ( table 1 ) .",
    "the outbursts are broadly similar , even though the central star masses differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "another uncertainty in a layered disk model is @xmath26 , which depends on the flux of ionizing radiation and the abundance and size distribution of the dust .",
    "in protostars with mass infall rates from 10@xmath85 to 10@xmath7 , most of the infall mass is transported to the inner disk by the gi in the dead zone , and mass transport through the active layer is negligible .",
    "thus @xmath26 has little effect on the unsteady accretion and the outburst ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diftaunei ] ) , but it does affect the mass accretion rate in the low state .",
    "the mass accretion rate in a layered disk is determined by the active layer mass accretion rate at @xmath79 . at @xmath106",
    "the disk is mri active due to thermal ionization .",
    "thus the disk mass accretion rate should be proportional to @xmath107 , which is shown in figure [ fig : diftaunei ] .",
    "the above parameter study can be simply summarized in the @xmath108 plane as shown in figure [ fig : m1 ] , which builds upon the steady state vertical structure calculations ( z2009a ; an analytical analysis is given in the appendix ) .",
    "the shaded regions in figure [ fig : m1 ] are the radii at which disk accretion is expected to be unsteady if the mass infall rate is constant .",
    "the solid curve farthest to the lower right in the figure ( labeled @xmath109 ) is the radius where the central temperature of a pure gi - driven disk ( q=1 disk ) would reach @xmath74 ( e.g. 1400 k ) . in other words , at a given infall rate @xmath21 , pure gi disks can accrete steadily beyond @xmath99 by the gi , but within @xmath99 the mri will be activated . up and to the left of @xmath109 in figure [ fig : m1 ] another solid curve , labeled @xmath110 , denotes the radii at which a pure mri disk of the given @xmath10 would have a central temperature of t@xmath77 . if the disk is mri active , it can accrete steadily purely by the mri within @xmath110 , but beyond @xmath110 the mri will be turned off . when @xmath111 and @xmath109 cross a smooth transition between the gi and mri exists and steady accretion is possible . from the left panel of figure [ fig : m1 ] ,",
    "we see thatthe disk can accrete steadily with @xmath0=0.01 and @xmath112 .",
    "this is observed in the time evolution discussed in  4.1 and figure [ fig:1em4 ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we predict that in the shaded regions matter will pile up through the action of gi , trigger the mri , and produce an outburst .",
    "the dotted curve shows @xmath99 and @xmath110 if t@xmath77=1800 k ( at which temperature all dust has sublimated ) . @xmath99 and @xmath110 at 1800 k are smaller than they are at 1400 k because of the temperature plateau around the dust sublimation temperature ( z2009a ;",
    "also can be seen at r@xmath3 2 - 10 au in figs .",
    "[ fig:14001800 ] ) .",
    "thus if @xmath74 is higher , outbursts are expected to be shorter because the outburst drains the small inner disk ( @xmath113 ) on a shorter viscous timescale ( as demonstrated in figures [ fig:1em4]-[fig:1em62 ] ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath67 can also be seen by comparing the left and right panels of figure [ fig : m1 ] .",
    "the classical thermal instability will also be triggered at the infall phase as shown by the upper left shaded band in figure [ fig : m1 ] .",
    "even the ` steady ' accretion case discussed above with @xmath0=0.01 and @xmath112 is subject to thermal instability at @xmath114 .",
    "the two lines shown in figure [ fig : m1 ] correspond to the two limiting values of the `` s curve '' ( e.g. , faulkner , lin , & papaloizou 1983 ) at which transitions to the high ( rapid accretion ) state and the low ( slow accretion ) state occur .",
    "the instability depends on the disk s vertical structure ( different  s curves \" ) which behaves differently in 2-d than in 1-d , as discussed in  3 .",
    "we expect nature to behave somewhat more like the 2-d than the 1-d case , so for the steady accretion model discussed above convection will add small variations in @xmath78 and we refer to these steady accretion cases as quasi - steady . generally , the thermally unstable region is distinctive at @xmath115 , which suggests the ti may be common for protostellar disks .",
    "the solid dots in figure [ fig : m1 ] are the mri trigger radii from our 1-d simulations when @xmath116k .",
    "although the trigger radii do not fall precisely on r@xmath117 , most of them are in the shaded region , indicating that this @xmath108 plane has predicted non - steady accretion , with potential outbursts , to occur for infall rates @xmath118 for @xmath89 and @xmath119 for @xmath90 . for @xmath120 and @xmath91",
    ", the mri - gi instability wo nt occur based on this @xmath108 plane , which agrees with the 1-d simulations .",
    "generally , our @xmath108 plane results provide a good guide to the parameters for which unsteady accretion occurs .",
    "the outbursts and ti in quasi - steady accretion could provide a much hotter thermal history for the protostellar disks , which may have imprints on meteorites and the chemicals in the protostellar disks .      the non - steady disk accretion in our model",
    "is the result of the inability of the inner disk to transport mass inward at the same rate as mass is fed in from the outer disk by infall , @xmath121 .",
    "this mass pileup eventually leads to mri activation and outbursts .",
    "even after infall ends , the dead zone evolves with time if the mass addition from the outer disk due to gi and viscous stresses exceeds what can be carried inward by the active layer .",
    "terquem ( 2008 ) was able to construct steady - state disk accretion solutions with active layers and `` dead '' zones .",
    "the difference is due to the assumptions of both finite , non - gi viscosity in the dead zone and to assuming a very much lower mass accretion rate , @xmath122 . at such low accretion rates , even very low non - gi",
    "dead zone viscosities and comparable active layer properties suffice to transport mass at these rates through the inner disk , which is not possible in our disks driven on the outside at high mass infall rates ( except for small centrifugal radii , in which case the disk becomes fully mri - active ) .",
    "fu orionis objects are outbursting systems with maximum disk accretion rates @xmath123 10@xmath7 and a decay time of decades to hundreds of years ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) .",
    "these properties constrain our parameter space .",
    "the outbursts produced by 1d2z models are sensitive to @xmath67 and t@xmath77 .",
    "figures 2 - 4 show that @xmath67=0.1 , t@xmath77=1800 k leads to outbursts that are too strong ( @xmath78=10@xmath124 ) , while @xmath67=0.01 , t@xmath77=1400 k leads to outbursts that are too long ( 3000 yr).@xmath125 ( @xmath126 is the flux ; thus @xmath127 is an e - folding time ) . in principle",
    "the outburst could have nonexponential time dependence and the duration of the outburst could differ from @xmath127 . in our models , however , the luminosity exceeds the preoutburst luminosity for a time only slightly longer than @xmath127 . ]",
    "if t@xmath77=1400 k , the outburst start at @xmath33 au ( figure [ fig:14001800 ] ) , so @xmath10 needs to be large to produce the correct decay timescale . if @xmath128k the outburst is triggered at @xmath129au , so @xmath130 is required to maintain the correct outburst timescale .",
    "one uncertainty here is that @xmath67 in a non - thermally ionized active layer may not be the same as @xmath67 in a thermally ionized , dust free , fully conducting medium .",
    "thus we mostly constrain @xmath67 in the latter ( outburst stage ) from the decay timescale ; @xmath67 in the active layer is not well - constrained by outbursts .",
    "another uncertainty is related to our assumption of constant @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath26 is instead a function of radius the disk s long term evolution will change . at early stages , however , if the gi in the outer disk dominates the disk s accretion , variation of @xmath26 will have little effect on the outburst mechanism discussed here .",
    "the central star mass and infall rate do not significantly change the outbursts .",
    "this agrees with the observation that fu orionis outbursts occur for protostars with different infall rates ( quanz et al .",
    "2007 and zhu et al 2008 found that fu orionis objects could be either class 0 or class i objects . ) .",
    "zhu et al . ( 2007 ) argued that the decay timescale for fu ori implies @xmath0 @xmath3 0.02 - 0.2 .",
    "this conclusion can be tested with our 1-d simulations .",
    "the last column in table 1 shows the viscous timescale calculated using @xmath110 and @xmath66 : @xmath131 where @xmath132 @xmath133 and @xmath134 are calculated with @xmath66 and @xmath110 .    comparing with the outbursts duration in column 6",
    ", we see the viscous time is close to the outburst time for t@xmath77=1400 k. if t@xmath77=1800 k , the viscous time is 2 - 3 times longer than the outburst time , which may be due to the disk s temperature during the outburst being higher than t@xmath77 if the mri is triggered at smaller radius as t@xmath77=1800 k case . however , since constraining @xmath0 by using the viscous timescale is an order of magnitude estimate , our simulations are consistent with the zhu et al ( 2007 ) estimate .",
    "in this paper , we have evolved a one - dimensional layered disk model including both mri and gi to study the unsteady disk accretion of protostars .",
    "the 1-d models reproduce the general properties of 2-d ( axisymmetric ) outbursts reasonably well , such as the outbursting mass accretion rate , duration and the accreted mass during one outburst .",
    "because the 1-d model is faster , it enables us to study outbursts in an extended parameter space .",
    "our results confirm that the disk can accrete steadily with high infall rates ( @xmath21@xmath310@xmath22@xmath25 if @xmath67=0.01 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this steady accretion may still have short timescale variations , however , due to the thermal instability in the inner disk , as suggested by our earlier , 2-d simulations .",
    "we also confirm the prediction by z2009a that protostars are likely to accrete unsteadily / in outbursts for infall rates @xmath135 with @xmath89 and @xmath136 for @xmath90 .",
    "outbursts are triggered at @xmath137  au for protostellar infall rates @xmath138 .",
    "the outbursts are stronger and shorter with larger @xmath67 or t@xmath77 .",
    "the total mass accreted during one outburst mainly depends on t@xmath77 . while the outbursts are slightly shorter for more massive central stars , the outburst @xmath78 is nearly independent of central star mass .",
    "the active layer surface density only affects the mass accretion rate in the low state ; it has little effect on the outburst .    by comparing with the mass accretion rate and duration of observed fu orionis events",
    ", we can constrain a combination of @xmath67 and t@xmath77 . if @xmath67 is low ( 0.01 )",
    ", t@xmath77 needs to be high ( 1800 k , higher than the dust sublimation temperature ) ; if @xmath10 is high ( 0.1 ) then @xmath74 needs to be low ( @xmath1391400 k ) .",
    "our results show that 1-d , two zone models can capture the basic features of disk evolution , given our assumptions about the action of the mri and gi . in a later paper",
    "we will address disk evolution over a much longer timescale , explicitly taking into account mass infall from a rotating protostellar cloud .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grant nnx08a139 g , by the university of michigan , by a sony faculty fellowship , a richard and margaret romano professorial scholarship , and a university scholar appointment to charles gammie .    by assuming a marginally gravitationally stable ( q=1.5 ) disk , the disk s structure",
    "is determined with a given @xmath78 , and thus the radius where the outburst is triggered ( r@xmath117 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] and z2009a ) can be derived . unlike z2009a where the detailed vertical structure is calculated numerically to give r@xmath117 , here we give simple analytical results for r@xmath117 by assuming the disk is vertically isothermal with constant opacity at a given radius .",
    "first , if @xmath46=ct@xmath140p@xmath141 , the relationship between @xmath8 and the central ( midplane ) temperature t@xmath142 is given by @xmath143 using the form for @xmath46 and using @xmath144=@xmath145 , where h is the disk scale height , @xmath146 or equivalently @xmath147 where @xmath134 is the angular velocity at r , @xmath148 is the boltzmann constant and m@xmath149 is the unit molecular mass .",
    "the dust opacity fitting from z2009a suggests , at t@xmath154 k , @xmath0=0.738 , @xmath155=0 and c=0.053 .",
    "if we plot the relationship between r and @xmath78 by given t@xmath142=t@xmath77=1400 k and q=1.5 , we find @xmath156 which corresponds well with the r@xmath117 calculated in figure [ fig : m1 ] .    since r@xmath117@xmath157@xmath158 for @xmath66=1400 k case ,",
    "the outburst timescale is roughly @xmath159 where @xmath160 is calculated for t@xmath142=t@xmath77=1400 k. during outburst , however , t@xmath142 could be higher than the mri trigger temperature t@xmath77 , especially in the inner part of the disk .",
