    "in anticipation of the international linear collider ( ilc ) , a proposed @xmath9 collider with center - of - mass energies between 90 and 500  gev , upgradable to 1  tev , and polarised beams , several detector concepts are being discussed . in order to evaluate the performance of these concepts , benchmark processes",
    "have been chosen which are challenging for key aspects of the detector designs  @xcite .    in order to test the jet energy resolution ,",
    "a supersymmetric scenario which assumes non - universal soft susy - breaking contributions to the higgs masses has been defined . in this scenario ,",
    "the mass differences between the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) and the heavier gauginos become large , while at the same time the sleptons are so heavy that gaugino decays into sleptons are kinematically forbidden .",
    "the corresponding benchmark point has been defined in  @xcite as `` point 5 '' with the following susy parameters :    @xmath10    with a top quark mass of @xmath11  gev , the following gaugino masses are obtained by spheno  @xcite :    @xmath12    the lightest sleptons are even heavier than the gauginos , thus leading to branching fractions of 99.4% for the decay @xmath13 and 96.4% for @xmath14 :    @xmath15    in order to benchmark the jet energy reconstruction , the fully hadronic decay mode of the gauge bosons is considered here . in this mode , chargino and neutralino events can only be separated via the mass of the vector bosons they decay into .",
    "the motivation of this study is not to evaluate the final precision which could be achieved at the ilc by combining several final states , or even by performing threshold scans , but to test the detector performance in the most challenging decay mode .",
    "the analysis is performed at a center of mass energy of 500  gev for an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath4 with beam polarisations of @xmath5 .",
    "it is based on a detailed simulation of the ild detector based on geant4  @xcite , which is described briefly in the next section .",
    "section  [ sect : reco ] discusses the event reconstruction and selection procedure , including a pure standard model control selection .",
    "the results for the cross - section and mass measurement are presented in sections  [ sect : xsection ] and [ sect : mass ] , respectively .",
    "the proposed ild detector has been described in detail in the ild letter of intent  @xcite .",
    "its main characteristics comprise a time projection chamber as a main tracking device , which is complemented by silicon tracking and vertexing detectors , and highly granular electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters as required for the particle flow approach  @xcite .",
    "both , tracking system and calorimeters , are included in a solenoidal magnetic field with a strength of 3.5  t provided by a superconducting coil .",
    "the magnetic flux is returned in an iron yoke , which is instrumented for muon detection .",
    "special calorimeters at low polar angles complement the hermeticity of the detector and provide luminosity measurement .",
    "while previous studies were based on fast simulation programs which smear four - vectors with expected resolutions , we have used a full geant4 based simulation of all ild compoments .",
    "many details are included , in particular gaps in the sensitive regions and realistic estimates of dead material due to cables , mechanical support , cooling and so on .    with this detector simulation ,",
    "the following performance has been achieved  @xcite : for tracks with a transverse momentum @xmath16 larger than 1  gev , the tracking efficiency is 99.5% across almost the entire polar angle range of @xmath17 covered by the tracking detectors , with a @xmath16 resolution of better than @xmath18 .",
    "the calorimetric system has been designed to deliver a jet energy resolution of 3.0% to 3.7% over a large range of energies from 250 gev down to 45 gev for polar angles @xmath19 in the range @xmath20 .",
    "the luminosity is expected to be known to @xmath21 from measurements of the bhabha scattering cross - sections at small angles .",
    "the beam polarisations and the beam energies will be measured to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively by dedicated instrumentation in the beam delivery system .",
    "the event sample used in this analysis has been generated using the matrix element generator whizard  @xcite .",
    "it comprises all standard model processes plus all kinematically accessible susy processes in the chosen scenario . in total , about @xmath24 events have been generated and processed through the full simulation and reconstruction chain for this analysis .",
    "the reconstruction and also the first event selection steps are implemented in the marlinreco framework  @xcite .",
    "the central part of the reconstruction for this analysis is the particle flow algorithm pandora  @xcite , which forms charged and neutral particle candidates - so - called `` particle flow objects '' or pfos - from tracks and calorimeter clusters .",
    "the resulting list of pfos for each event is forced into a 4jet configuration using the durham algorithm .",
    "the jet energy scale is raised by 1% , determined from dijet samples .",
    "no special treatment of b - quark jets is considered here .    as a final step of the reconstruction , a constrained kinematic fit  @xcite , which requires the two dijet masses of the event to be equal ,",
    "is performed on each event .",
    "all three possible jet pairings are tested .",
    "the resulting improvement in mass resolution is evaluated on standard model events , as described in section  [ sec : smcontrol ] .",
    "the major part of the standard model events is rejected by applying the following selection to all events in the susy and sm samples :    * in order to eliminate pure leptonic events , the total number of tracks in the event should be larger than @xmath25 and each jet has to contain at least two tracks . * since the two lsps escape undetected , the visible energy of the event @xmath26 should be less than 300  gev . in order to remove a substantial fraction of 2-photon events with very low visible energy , @xmath27  gev",
    "is required as well . * to ensure a proper jet reconstruction , each jet should have a reconstructed energy of at least 5  gev and a polar angle @xmath19 fulfilling @xmath28 .",
    "* 2-jet events are rejected by requiring the distance parameter of the durham jet algorithm for which the event flips from 4-jet to 3-jet configuration , @xmath29 to be larger than 0.001 .",
    "* coplanar events ( e.g.  @xmath30 with isr / beamstrahlung photons ) are removed by requiring @xmath31 of the missing momentum to be smaller than 0.99 . *",
    "no lepton candidate with an energy larger than 25  gev is allowed in order to suppress semi - leptonic events .",
    "the upper part of table  [ tbl : cutstat ] shows the reduction for these cuts .",
    "the selection efficiency of hadronic chargino and neutralino pair events is very high , 88.1% and 90.8% , respectively .",
    "therefore , we will refer to this stage in the selection process as `` high efficiency '' selection .",
    "although the sm background is significantly reduced already by these cuts , the contribution from 4-fermion events is still large , about 6 times the chargino signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitmass_allcuts]a ) shows the reconstructed boson mass distribution as obtained by the constrained kinematic fit after these selection cuts .",
    "a large fraction of the remaining standard model background features low invariant dijet masses , but nevertheless a sizable amount of background remains also in the signal region .    for the cross - section measurement , the sample is therefore cleaned further by four additional cuts :    * the number of particle flow objects ( pfos ) in each jet should be @xmath32 in order to reject @xmath33 jets more effectively . *",
    "the direction of the missing momentum should fulfill @xmath34 : this cut is quite powerful to reject all kinds of sm backgrounds , which tend to peak in the forward region , while the signal follows a flat @xmath35 distribution .",
    "nevertheless , it reduces the signal efficiency substantially , which could be avoided for example by placing a more stringent cut on the missing mass instead ( see next item ) .",
    "however , the missing mass distribution of the signal directly depends on the lsp mass , thus it should not be too finely tuned to specific mass values , since we want to measure the gaugino masses .",
    "the prediction of a flat @xmath35 distribution depends only on the spin , and can thus be considered model - independent ( within susy ) . * the missing mass should be larger than 220  gev to further reject 6-fermion events ( semi - leptonic @xmath36 ) .",
    "the value of this cut is chosen such that it is in a region with no susy contribution , i.e. where the data should agree with the sm expectation .",
    "thus in a real experiment an adequate cut position could be found from the data .",
    "for this reason , no upper cut is placed on @xmath37 , since other susy processes contribute there , and it would not be trivial to determine a suitable cut value from real data . *",
    "the kinematic fit constraining the two dijet masses to be equal should converge for at least one jet pairing : this is necessary in order to use the fit result for further analysis .",
    "the efficiency and resolution of the fit can be cross - checked easily on real data , for instance with the control selection decribed in the previous section .",
    "the obtained reduction due to these cuts is shown in the last four lines of table  [ tbl : cutstat ] .",
    "the final distribution of the reconstructed boson mass , again obtained by the constrained kinematic fit , is displayed in figure  [ fig : fitmass_allcuts]b .",
    "it illustrates the achieved boson mass resolution and thus @xmath38 and @xmath39 pair separation , however at significantly reduced efficiency .",
    "fitting the total spectrum by a fourth order polynomial for the background plus the sum of two breit - wigner functions folded with a gaussian for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 contributions , the mass resolutions can be determined to 3.4  % .",
    "table  [ tbl : cutstat2 ] shows the final purity and efficiency of signal and major background processes . according to this table",
    ", @xmath40 is the dominant process in the remaining background .",
    "since the chargino and neutralino separation relies on reconstructing the masses of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 bosons from their decay products , the dijet mass resolution is a crucial parameter in this analysis and has to be determined from standard model @xmath38 and @xmath39 pair events . for this purpose ,",
    "the `` high efficiency '' selection from above is applied to all simulated data , inverting only the cut on the visible energy to @xmath41  gev .",
    "this yields an event sample which is vastly dominated by 4-fermion events , with a small contribution from 6-fermion events , but no susy events .",
    "the corresponding dijet mass spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : sm_sel ] .",
    "the mass resolution has been determined for two cases :    * the jet pairing is chosen such that the difference between the two dijet masses in each event is minimized . * a kinematic fit , which constrains the two dijet masses in each event to be equal , is performed for all three possible jet - boson associations . the jet pairing which yields the highest fit probability is chosen .",
    "the resulting mass distributions are fitted with the sum of two breit - wigner functions convoluted with a gaussian , fixing the @xmath38 and @xmath39 widths as well as the @xmath39 pole mass to their pdg values and having the same @xmath42 for both gaussians , plus a forth order polynomial for all non - resonant contributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : sm_fits ] shows the fitted spectra and the resulting fit parameters . in case a ) , without the kinematic fit , the dijet mass resolution is determined as @xmath43  gev , while it is reduced to @xmath44  gev when the kinematic fit is applied .",
    "these mass resolutions are even better than in the susy case , since the kinematics of the events is more favourable here .",
    "while the sm gauge boson pairs are highly boosted and thus finding the correct jet pairing is relatively easy , the bosons in our susy scenario are produced nearly at rest , resulting in a higher combinatorical background and a slightly worse boson mass resolution .",
    "nevertheless , a sm control selection will be crucial to demonstrate the level of detector understanding , since the actual susy measurement will rely on template distributions and selection efficiencies determined from simulations .",
    "the cross - sections of @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be measured by determining the amount of @xmath38 and @xmath39 pair like events . for the hadronic events we are concerned with here",
    ", a 2-dimensional fit in the plane of the two dijet masses per event is performed to obtain the amount of @xmath38 and @xmath39 pair candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : djm - csfit ] shows the dijet mass distributions without the kinematic fit .",
    "all three possible jet - boson associations are taken into account in the histograms .",
    "[ fig : djm - csfit]a shows the dijet mass distribution of all standard model and susy point5 events passing the selection cuts ; [ fig : djm - csfit]b is the sm part of [ fig : djm - csfit]a ; [ fig : djm - csfit]c and [ fig : djm - csfit]d are statistically independent template samples for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , made by 500 fb@xmath4 . before the fitting , the sm contribution ( [ fig : djm - csfit]b ) is subtracted from the distribution of all events ( [ fig : djm - csfit]a ) .",
    "susy contributions other than @xmath0 and @xmath1 pair are not corrected for , but the contribution is negligibly small .",
    "figure  [ fig : djm - csfit]e shows the result of a fit using a linear combination of the chargino and neutralino template distributions depicted [ fig : djm - csfit]c and d in .",
    "the residuals of the fit are displayed in figure  [ fig : djm - csfit]f .",
    "they are sufficiently small and do nt show any specific structures , indicating a well working fit .",
    "while it can be assumed that the sm distribution is well known and can be controlled for instance with the sm selection above , the assumption that the shape of the chargino and neutralino spectra is known is not evident .",
    "however , the shape of the dijet mass distribution on generator level is quite independent of the details of the susy scenario , as long as the decay into real @xmath38 and @xmath39 bosons is open .",
    "as discussed already in section  [ sec : smcontrol ] , the shape of the reconstructed dijet mass distribution is influenced by the mass differences between @xmath0 / @xmath47 and the lsp , which determines the boost of the vector bosons and thus has an effect on the amount of combinatorical background and the mass resolution .",
    "as shown in the next section , the masses of the gauginos can be measured purely from edge positions in the energy spectra of the gauge bosons , without any assumption on the cross - section .",
    "thus , with the gaugino masses measured , we are confident that enough is known about the susy scenario at hand to apply the template method .    the background subtraction and the fit have been performed 10000 times , varying the bin contents of the susy and the sm distribution according to their statistical errors .",
    "the fitted fractions of chargino and neutralino contribution have been averaged over all fit outcomes , while the expected uncertainty is estimated from the variance of the fit results .",
    "expressed in percent of the expected cross - section , this procedure yields @xmath48% for the chargino and @xmath49% for the neutralino case . in terms of absolute cross - sections",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath50fb@xmath4 ( mc : 124.84 fb@xmath4 ) , and @xmath51fb@xmath4 ( mc : 22.46 fb@xmath4 ) .",
    "if we use a best jet pairing rather than all combinations for the dijet mass , the statistical error grows by about 10% .",
    "this illustrates the fact that the true jet - boson association can not always be found and that the jet pairings not classified as `` best '' still contain valuable information .",
    "the masses of gauginos can be obtained via the energy spectrum of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 boson candidates , since the distribution of gauginos is box - like with edges determined by the masses and the center - of - mass energy .",
    "deviations from the pure box shape are due to the finite width of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 bosons , the beam energy spectrum and the detector resolution . for the mass measurement , we have to separate the sample on an event - by - events basis into @xmath0 and @xmath47 pair candidates .",
    "this is done via the dijet masses , as described in the next subsection .",
    "afterwards , the edge positions are fitted for both the chargino and neutralino selected sample .",
    "finally , the actual masses are calculated from the edge positions .      for each event ,",
    "the jet pairing with the highest probability in the kinematic fit is chosen .",
    "an event is selected as a chargino or neutralino candidate using the following @xmath52 variables , which are constructed from the invariant masses calculated from the four - vectors before the kinematic fit :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are dijet masses of selected jet - pairs , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the nominal @xmath38 and @xmath39 pole masses and @xmath42= 5  gev .",
    "events with @xmath58 are classified as @xmath59 , while events with @xmath60 & @xmath61 are selected as @xmath47 .    figure  [ fig : mass2-kinfit]a ) shows the energy spectrum of the selected @xmath38 candidates , while figure  [ fig : mass2-kinfit]b ) presents the same spectrum for the @xmath39 candidates .",
    "the edge positions can be seen in the spectra , although the four - fermion background is still large , especially in the @xmath39 energy distribution .",
    "the sm background can be fitted separately , as described below .      in the next step , the energy spectra of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 candidates",
    "are fitted according to the following procedure .    1 .",
    "first , the standard model contribution is fitted with the following function : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 denotes the boson energy , and @xmath64 is the voigt function , i.e. a breit - wigner function of width @xmath65 convoluted with a gaussian of resolution @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath66 parameter adjusts the threshold position , while the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are used to describe the shape of the plateau with a second order polynomial .",
    "the result of this fit is shown in figure  [ fig : mass2-kinfit ] .",
    "since the available statistics of the standard model sample is limited , the actual background used in the susy fit is generated from the fitted functions , including fluctuations according to the statistical errors expected from 500  fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity .",
    "3 .   finally , the sum of the susy spectra and the sm spectra generated in the previous step are fitted .",
    "the susy part of the fitting function is similar to the one used on the standard model , but this time also an upper edge position @xmath70 is introduced .",
    "furthermore , the gaussian resolution @xmath42 is allowed to have two different values at the edge positions , namely @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with intermediate values obtained by linear interpolation . @xmath73",
    "all parameters of @xmath74 are fixed to the values obtained in the first step . for the @xmath47 fit , @xmath75 is also fixed to 0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass2-kinfit ] shows the results of the sm fit as well as the results of susy mass fit for both the chargino and the neutralino selection . to obtain edge positions ,",
    "the fit is performed 100 times with different standard model spectra generated from the sm fit function . as final result ,",
    "the averaged edge position and error are given :    * @xmath0 lower edge : @xmath76 ( mc : 79.80 ) gev , * @xmath0 upper edge : @xmath77 ( mc : 132.77 ) gev , * @xmath47 lower edge : @xmath78 ( mc : 93.09 ) gev , and * @xmath47 upper edge : @xmath79 ( mc : 129.92 ) gev .",
    "there is a tendency that the fitted numbers are slightly smaller than mc numbers .",
    "better jet energy correction or modification of the fitting function can reduce the shift , but principally the shift could be corrected with a dedicated mc study .",
    "the relation between the gaugino masses and the energy endpoints of the gauge bosons is determined by pure kinematics . neglecting radiation losses , the energy of the gauginos is equal to the beam energy:@xmath80 . in the gaugino restsystem ,",
    "denoted with @xmath81 , the energy of the vector boson ( i.e. @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) is given by the usual formula for two - body decays : @xmath82 where subscript @xmath83 denotes the decaying gaugino ( i.e. @xmath0 or @xmath47 ) , @xmath84 the vector boson ( i.e. @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) and the lsp @xmath6 . boosting this into the laboratory system yields : @xmath85 the lorentz boost @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 , and @xmath88",
    ". the plus sign will give the upper edge of the allowed energy range , @xmath89 , and the minus sign the lower one , @xmath90 .",
    "for further calculations it is useful to introduce the center point of the allowed energy range , @xmath91 , and its width @xmath92 : @xmath93 in solving equation  [ form : edges ] for the gaugino masses , it is useful to note that @xmath94 . with this relation ,",
    "@xmath95 can be eliminated and thus the lsp mass in obtained from @xmath92 : @xmath96 this is a quadratic equation in @xmath97 , which has two solutions : @xmath98 \\label{form : gamma2}\\ ] ] inserting this into @xmath94 , the lsp mass can be solved for : @xmath99 for a single energy spectrum , we thus have two solutions in the general case .",
    "however with the constraint that the lsp mass has to be the same for both the chargino and the neutralino decay , a unique solution can be determined - in this case the one with the upper sign .    for the point5 susy parameters ,",
    "the lower edge of the @xmath38 energy spectrum is just equal to the @xmath38 rest mass , meaning that the @xmath38 bosons from the decay can be produced at rest , with the lsp carrying away all the momentum .",
    "this case has to be distinguished from a configuration where the boost is so large that the @xmath38 could actually fly into the same direction as the lsp in the laboratory frame . in this case , since the energy can not become lower than the @xmath38 rest mass , the lower part of the spectrum would be `` folded over '' and create a second falling edge above the @xmath38 mass , precisely at @xmath100 , where @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , this case of @xmath102 corresponds to the case where the equation for @xmath97 has only one solution , with the @xmath103 term of equation  [ form : gamma2 ] vanishing . at this point , the partial derivative @xmath104 becomes zero .",
    "so the inverse derivative which appears in the error propagation becomes undefined - or more realistically , with @xmath102 not exactly fulfilled , at least very large .    since the discrimination between models is beyond the scope of this paper , but",
    "will be subject of future studies , we ignore here possible information from the lower edge of the @xmath38 energy spectrum . instead , the lower and upper edge of the @xmath39 energy spectrum are used to calculate the masses of @xmath47 and @xmath6 . in a second step",
    ", the chargino mass is calculated from the lsp mass and the upper edge of the @xmath38 spectrum .",
    "the error propagation is done by using a toy monte carlo , taking into account the correlations between the two masses determined from one energy spectrum .",
    "it calculates the gaugino masses by above equations with edge positions varying randomly according to their errors obtained from the edge fit . for the center edge positions two patterns were tried , the fitted edge positions and the mc truth positions .",
    "table  [ tab : masses ] shows the obtained mass values and errors . without correction of the edge position ,",
    "the average value of obtained masses deviates by 3 - 4 gev from the mc truth .",
    "this might be due to the fact that phase space was not considered , and could be reduced by an improved fitting function . with better fitting functions . without the kinematic fit ,",
    "the mass resolution is worse by typically 400 to 500  mev , which corresponds to 15 to 40% of the errors , depending on the gaugino considered .",
    "the physics performance of the ild detector concept has been evaluated using a susy benchmark scenario referred to as `` point 5 '' , where @xmath0 and @xmath47 are nearly mass degenerate and decay into real @xmath105 and @xmath106 bosons , respectively , plus a @xmath6 .",
    "the cross - sections for chargino and neutralino pair production have been obtained by a fit to the two - dimensional dijet mass spectrum relying on monte - carlo templates .",
    "the resulting statistical errors are 0.84% in the chargino case and 2.75% in the neutralino case .",
    "the gaugino masses have been determined from a fit to the edges of the energy spectra of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 bosons obtained by a kinematic fit .",
    "the resulting mass resolutions are 2.9  gev , 1.7  gev and 1.0  gev for @xmath0 , @xmath47 and @xmath6 , respectively . without the kinematic fit ,",
    "the mass resolution is worse by 400 to 500  mev .",
