    "their simplicity and wide applicability , markov chains based on metropolis - hastings ( mh ) transition kernels @xcite and their numerous variants remain the most widely used scheme for sampling from a general target probability distribution , despite having been introduced over 60 years ago .",
    "as there are infinitely many markov processes which are ergodic with respect to a given target distribution @xmath1 , a natural question is whether a markov process can be chosen which is more efficient , in terms of convergence to equilibrium and mixing .",

    "detailed balance_. it is a well documented fact that nonreversible chains might convergence to equilibrium faster than reversible ones @xcite .",
    "various mcmc schemes have been proposed which are based on the general idea of breaking reversibility by introducing an augmented target measure on an extended state space , along with dynamics which are invariant with respect to the augmented target measure . for discrete state spaces ,",
    "the lifting method @xcite is one such approach , where the markov chain is `` lifted '' from the state space @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "the transition probabilities in each copy of @xmath5 are modified to introduce transitions between the copies to preserve the invariant distribution but now promote the sampler to generate long trajectories . for continuous state spaces ,",
    "analogous approaches involve augmenting the state space with a velocity / momentum variable and constructing makovian dynamics which are able to mix more rapidly in the augmented state space .",
    "such methods include hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) methods , inspired by hamiltonian dynamics . while the standard construction of hmc @xcite is reversible , it is straightforward to construct dynamics based on the generalized hmc scheme @xcite which will not be reversible , see also @xcite and more recently @xcite . +   + deferring issues of simulation until later , another candidate markov process for sampling from @xmath1 is the diffusion @xmath7 defined by the following it stochastic differential equation ( sde ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a standard @xmath4valued brownian motion and @xmath10 is a smooth vector field which satisfies @xmath11 for some smooth vector field @xmath12 on @xmath4 satisfying some mild assumptions ( c.f . proposition [ prop : main ] ) .",

    ", a natural question is how it should be chosen to ensure that for a given time @xmath18 , the mse in is as small as possible .",

    "it should be emphasised that the optimal choice will be different for each case . in particular in @xcite , it was shown that the choice @xmath37 , which corresponds to using reversible dynamics , gives the maximum value of asymptotic variance for a given choice of diffusion tensor .",
    "in particular , introducing a nonreversible perturbation will never decrease the performance of an estimator based on langevin dynamics , both in terms of convergence to equilibrium and asymptotic variance .",
    "+   + in general ( [ eq : sde1 ] ) can not be simulated exactly , and one typically resorts to a discretisation of the sde , denoted by @xmath38 , in order to approximate @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , the following ergodic average is used @xmath40 extra caution has to be taken in order to ensure that the above quantity converges in the limit of @xmath41 since even if ( [ eq : sde1 ] ) is ergodic ( or even exponentially ergodic ) , this will not necessarily be the case for its numerical discretisation @xcite .",
    "in addition , even when the numerical discretization is ergodic and thus @xmath42 it is not true in general that @xmath43 , since the underlying numerical discretization introduces bias in the estimation of @xmath39 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one way to eliminate such bias is through metropolization @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the introduction of an accept - reject step that ensures that the corresponding markov chain is ergodic with respect to the target distribution @xmath1",
    ". however , such bias elimination might not be advantageous in practice since the metropolised chain will be reversible by construction , thus eliminating any benefit introduced by the nonreversible perturbation @xmath12 .",
    "+   + when computing expectations of distributions with expensive likelihoods , it might be too costly to sample a long markov chain trajectory .",
    "if an appropriate nonreversible langevin dynamics can be introduced which does give rise to a dramatic reduction in asymptotic variance , then it might be advantageous to permit a controlled amount of bias in exchange for needing to sample fare less .",
    "this bias - variance tradeoff , in the context of numerical discretisations of is the subject of study of this paper .",
    "in particular , we will consider discretizations based on a lie - trotter splitting between the reversible and the nonreversible part of the dynamics .",
    "more specifically , we consider integrators of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a integrator that approximates the flow map corresponding to the deterministic dynamics @xmath46 and @xmath47 which approximates the reversible dynamics @xmath48 the choice of @xmath49 has a fundamental influence on the bias , asymptotic variance and stability of the resulting sampler .",
    "in particular , if one chooses @xmath50 to be a metropolised integrator @xcite then , similarly to the result in @xcite , the order of convergence of the deterministic integrator @xmath50 provides a lower bound for the difference between expectations with respect to @xmath51 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , this is not the case for the numerical asymptotic variance @xmath52 , since even though we can show that it is a perturbation of @xmath53 the difference will depend crucially on the choice of @xmath54 .",
    "these results are important as they allow to choose the correct combination of dynamics and numerical scheme that drastically reduces the computational cost required to achieve a given tolerance of error",
