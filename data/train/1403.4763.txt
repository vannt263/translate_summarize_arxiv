    ", an agent flips its state to a new state at a rate proportional to the number of neighboring agents that possess the new state . in a finite connected network ,",
    "consensus of one state is always the eventual outcome of the voter model dynamics .",
    "social networks in which opinion formation takes place are usually complex .",
    "in particular , community structure , in which connection is dense within groups and sparse across different groups , is a hallmark of a majority of social networks .",
    "a community would correspond to a circle of friends , school class , organization , household , and so on @xcite .",
    "consensus formation in networks with community structure may need a long time because communities are sparsely connected to each other by definition and different communities have to align their states for the consensus in the entire network to be reached .",
    "in fact , in the voter model in metapopulation networks in which agents randomly diffuse from one metapopulation to another , a small diffusion rate ( corresponding to sparse connectivity between communities ) slows down consensus @xcite .",
    "in addition , consensus is often hampered in other opinion formation models when the network possesses community structure @xcite .",
    "however , the extent to which the community structure slows down the consensus dynamics is unclear .",

    "the fokker - planck equation in terms of the density of @xmath10 voters in the two cliques , denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho_2}\\left [ \\frac{c}{n+c}\\left(\\rho_1-\\rho_2\\right)p\\right]\\notag\\\\ % & + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial^2 \\rho_1 ^ 2 } \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\rho_1\\left(1-\\rho_1\\right)}{n+c}+ \\frac{\\frac{c}{2n}\\left(\\rho_1+\\rho_2 - 2\\rho_1\\rho_2\\right)}{n+c } \\right)p\\right]\\notag\\\\ % & + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial^2 \\rho_2 ^ 2 } \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\rho_2\\left(1-\\rho_2\\right)}{n+c}+ \\frac{\\frac{c}{2n}\\left(\\rho_1+\\rho_2 - 2\\rho_1\\rho_2\\right)}{n+c } \\right)p\\right ] , \\label{eq : fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 represents the probability density .",

    "in fact , the fokker - planck approximation given by eq .",
    "breaks down when @xmath25 because the number of interclique links crucially differs node by node .",
    "in other words , most nodes possess either zero or one interclique link , and not having any interclique link and having one interclique link may result in substantially different behavior of nodes .",

    "the analysis in this section is valid for the entire range of @xmath8 .",
    "the dual process of the voter model is the coalescing random walk , in which walkers visiting the same node coalesce into a single walker . for arbitrary networks , the consensus time is equal to the time needed for the @xmath2 simple random walkers , one walker initially located per node , to coalesce into one @xcite . the time needed for the last two walkers to coalesce",
