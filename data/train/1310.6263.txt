    "recent measurements of reactor neutrinos have clearly demonstrated that the mixing angle @xmath0 of the lepton mixing matrix @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and , therefore , the element @xmath4 is non - zero . consequently , tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm )  @xcite is not viable anymore .",
    "writing the mixing matrix in terms of its column vectors @xmath5 ( @xmath3 ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath6 we can say that @xmath7 can not have the tbm form .",
    "however , it could still be that @xmath8 or @xmath9 agrees with the corresponding column in tbm .",
    "these cases are called tm@xmath10 and tm@xmath11 , respectively , in  @xcite : @xmath12 let us compare the predictions of these two cases . in both cases , @xmath13 and the product @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ckm - type phase in @xmath16 , are determined by @xmath17 . in the first case ,",
    "these quantities are given by  @xcite @xmath18 whereas in the second case one obtains  @xcite @xmath19 in these formulas , we use the customary abbreviations @xmath20 and @xmath21 . moreover , in the formulas for @xmath22 , small terms of order @xmath23 have been neglected for simplicity .",
    "it should be noted that the best - fit values of @xmath13 are smaller than 1/3  @xcite , but at any rate , 1/3 is in the @xmath24 range of @xmath13 . in that sense , tm@xmath10 fits the data slightly better than tm@xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , present data do not allow to determine the quantity @xmath22 .    of course",
    ", it could also be that the `` true '' mixing matrix is not related to tri - bimaximal mixing at all ; in this case none of the columns of the tbm matrix is a sensible approximation to one of the columns in the `` true '' mixing matrix .",
    "recently , a purely group - theoretical attempt to track down the flavour group @xmath25 of the lepton sector has been put forward which postulates that residual symmetries in the charged - lepton and neutrino mass matrices are reflections of @xmath25 and that the full flavour group can be determined by assembling the residual symmetries from both mass matrices  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the fact that at low energies the standard model gives the correct gauge structure of any extension trying to explain mass and mixing phenomena .",
    "therefore , left - handed charged and neutral lepton fields are not only in the same gauge doublets but also in the same multiplets with respect to @xmath25 , a fact which is hidden by spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this approach , it is possible that the flavour group determines one column of @xmath16 in terms of numbers of a purely group - theoretical origin .",
    "it is also possible that two columns are determined , which means that , due to unitarity , the _ full _ mixing matrix @xmath16 has a group - theoretical origin . in this context",
    ", we will see that tm@xmath11 plays a role .",
    "the plan of this report is as follows . in section  [ residual symmetries ] , we discuss the idea of residual symmetries . in section",
    "[ group scans ] , we briefly review the results of  @xcite , based on a computer - algebraic group scan .",
    "then we point out the connection between residual symmetries and roots of unity in section  [ residual symmetries and roots of unity ] . after applying this in section  [ tm1 and roots of unity ] to find all flavour groups which enforce tm@xmath10",
    ", we conclude in section  [ caveats ] by discussing some caveats of the method of residual symmetries .",
    "though the method of residual symmetries can also be applied to dirac fermions , here we confine ourselves to majorana neutrinos .",
    "then the mass lagrangian in the lepton sector is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the charge - conjugation matrix .",
    "the mass matrices of the charged leptons and neutrinos are diagonalized as @xmath28 respectively , leading to the mixing matrix @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that these matrices are diagonalizable can be reformulated as @xmath30 with unitary matrices @xmath31 , @xmath32 defined as @xmath33 equation  ( [ invariance ] ) holds for arbitrary @xmath34 and arbitrary @xmath35 . in group - theoretical terms ,",
    "the mass matrices are invariant under @xmath36 obviously , @xmath31 and @xmath32 depend on the vacuum expectation values and yukawa coupling constants , and equation  ( [ invariance ] ) contains no information beyond diagonalizability .",
    "the idea of residual symmetries is the following . in a weak basis ,",
    "the fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 are in the same multiplet of the flavour group @xmath25 under which the lagrangian is invariant .",
    "the flavour group @xmath25 is broken to different subgroups @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the charged - lepton and neutrino sector , respectively . from equation  ( [ invariance ] ) we know that @xmath41 for simplicity we assume that there is one generator @xmath42 of @xmath39 and one generator @xmath43 of @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath44 we furthermore assume that @xmath42 has three different eigenvalues .",
    "then @xmath42 and @xmath43 determine one column of @xmath16 , as we will argue now .",
    "due to equation  ( [ gg ] ) , we have @xmath45 with a unit vector @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since @xmath42 commutes with @xmath48 and has three different eigenvalues , we know that @xmath49 is diagonal . therefore",
    ", @xmath50 is determined by @xmath42 and is thus independent of any parameters of the lagrangian . for the rest of the argument we use the following theorem .",
    "if @xmath51 with @xmath52 , then @xmath53",
    ".    thus , @xmath46 is , apart from a phase , one of the columns of @xmath54 and , therefore , @xmath55 is a column in the mixing matrix @xmath16 . because @xmath55 is determined by the group",
    ", it does not contain parameters of the model .",
    "if there are two matrices @xmath56 , @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , two columns of @xmath16 are determined and thus the complete mixing matrix .",
    "there are two ways to tackle the mathematical problem of residual symmetries for the determination of possible flavour symmetry groups :    1 .   scanning classes of finite groups , 2 .   solving relations involving roots of unity .",
    "scans of groups have for instance been performed in  @xcite using gap  @xcite and the small groups library  @xcite .",
    "this library contains all finite groups with order up to 2000 , with the exception of the order of 1024 .",
    "here we want to discuss the results of  @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper have assumed that @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. _  there are two matrices @xmath61 in @xmath40 , and that the group produces mixing parameters @xmath62 within the @xmath24 range of the fit results of  @xcite .",
    "the authors have performed two scans . in the first one",
    ", they allowed for @xmath63 , with the exception of one group whose order is just 1536 , and assumed that @xmath39 is generated by @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "it is amazing that only three groups , namely @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , lead to acceptable mixing patterns .",
    "all three groups have tm@xmath11 and a trivial ckm - type phase .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 is given by equation  ( [ tm2 ] ) .",
    "one can show  @xcite that , in the case of the three viable groups , for every @xmath69 there are two solutions of @xmath70 given by @xmath71 with this formula , the numbers in the third colum in table  3 of  @xcite are reproduced .    in the second scan",
    "the authors of  @xcite have assumed that the group order is smaller that 512 but allowed for @xmath39 _ all _ abelian finite groups . in this case , no candidates were found .",
    "now we come to the second way of treating residual symmetries .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that    * @xmath39 is generated by @xmath42 and @xmath40 by @xmath43 , respectively , * @xmath72 and thus @xmath73 .",
    "then finiteness of the group @xmath25 requires the existence of positive integers @xmath74 , @xmath75 such that @xmath76 we denote the eigenvalues of @xmath42 by @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath78 has eigenvalues @xmath79 , then @xmath80 . if the unit vector @xmath46 in @xmath43 coincides with the @xmath81-th column of @xmath82 , then the trace and determinant of @xmath78 give  @xcite @xmath83 respectively .",
    "thus we have a vanishing sum of six roots of unity plus the condition for the determinant .",
    "equation  ( [ 6roots ] ) can be used in two ways .",
    "departing from elements @xmath43 and @xmath42 of a known group @xmath25 , one can search for suitable @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "one the other hand , for a given column in @xmath16 , one can try to find a suitable group @xmath25 .",
    "as an application of equation  ( [ 6roots ] ) we want to investigate which groups can enforce tm@xmath10  @xcite . in this case , the coefficients in equation  ( [ 6roots ] ) are @xmath86 and @xmath87 . therefore , equation  ( [ 6roots ] ) leads to the vanishing sum @xmath88 in order to solve this equation , one can apply a theorem of conway and jones  @xcite , referring to all possible vanishing sums of roots of unity up to nine roots . ) .",
    "we thank r.  fonseca for pointing this out us .",
    "] amazingly , the solution of equation  ( [ sumofroots ] ) allows very little freedom : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an arbitrary root of unity and @xmath91 . in the basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal , which we indicate by a tilde on @xmath42 and @xmath43 , this solution leads to @xmath92 with @xmath8 of equation  ( [ tm12 ] )",
    "clearly , @xmath93 must have this form because we departed from tm@xmath10 .",
    "one can show that @xmath94 and @xmath93 generate the group @xmath95 with @xmath90 being a primitive root of order @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "thus with the method of residual symmetries one finds an almost unique group for tm@xmath10 . for the generators of @xmath97 in its three - dimensional irreducible representations see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is instructive to go into another basis where @xmath43 has a simpler form . performing a similarity transformation with the matrix @xmath98 defined for instance in  @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath99 in that basis , @xmath48 is invariant under cyclic permutations and the eigenvector @xmath46 of @xmath43 with eigenvalue  1 is given by @xmath100 .",
    "consequently , up to a basis transformation , the mechanism for tm@xmath10 developed here boils down to @xmath101 , where @xmath8 is the first column of tbm  @xcite .",
    "up to now we have operated under the premises that the residual symmetries in @xmath48 and @xmath102 really determine the flavour group @xmath25 as a symmetry group of the lagrangian .",
    "let us be more precise now and denote by @xmath103 the group generated by the residual symmetries .",
    "what is the possible relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath103 ?",
    "clearly , @xmath104 due to three families of fermions .",
    "since the method is purely group - theoretical and uses only information contained in the mass matrices , @xmath103 can at most yield @xmath105 , the representation of @xmath25 on the lepton gauge doublets",
    ". moreover , there are models with accidental symmetries in the mass matrices , in which case @xmath103 not even a subgroup of @xmath105",
    ". finally , there are predictive models with total breaking of @xmath25 . clearly",
    ", there the method of residual symmetries is not applicable . + * acknowledgement : * the author thanks the organizers for their hospitality and the pleasurable atmosphere at the conference ."
