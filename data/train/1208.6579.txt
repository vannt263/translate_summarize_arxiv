    "observations over the past dozen years have shown that the universe is currently under accelerating expansion ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite for reviews ) . under the framework of general relativity and standard cosmology , a new form of exotic energy with negative pressure ( @xmath2 )",
    "is required to explain this phenomenon .",
    "current observations suggested this so called `` dark energy '' made up about 73% of the energy density of the universe  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "so far @xmath3 has been constrained to be very close to @xmath4 assuming it is constant and the universe is flat .",
    "this seems to suggest the observation data prefer a cosmological constant as dark energy .",
    "however , a parametrized dark energy @xmath5 has @xmath6 uncertainty in dynamical parameter @xmath7 , when compared to data .",
    "this means dynamical dark energy models are not excluded .",
    "several dark energy model have been proposed in order to explain the cosmic acceleration .",
    "in addition to the most discussed cosmological constant , dynamically evolving scalar - field dark energy has been widely studied ( for examples , see  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "quintessence is a specific case of scalar - field dark energy with canonical kinetic terms , which admits @xmath8 .",
    "it has drawn much attention because it can in principle provide the `` tracker '' property  a property that makes the energy density today insensitive to its initial condition , i.e. , the initial energy density value @xmath9  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "while fine - tuning of potential parameter is still required  @xcite , tracker quintessence can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem because a precise setting of initial energy density ratio for matter and dark energy is no longer required .",
    "present observational constraint on @xmath3 still allows for @xmath10 .",
    "for example , results from wigglez  @xcite showed current constraints on constant @xmath11 is @xmath12 after combining with the latest sn - ia , cmb and bao data .",
    "we note that while quintessence only allows for@xmath8 , phantom scalar - field , another dynamical de model , proposed by caldwell , carroll et al  @xcite , that invokes a negative kinetic energy , can satisfy @xmath13 . while there exist several known theoretical difficulties for phantom scalar - field dark energy model such as the violation of null dominant energy condition ( ndec )  @xcite and a possible big rip phase in the future  @xcite  @xcite , it is still very worth while to confront it directly and independently against the cosmological observations , especially since the current best - fit for equation - of - state is smaller than @xmath4(see  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite for examples ) .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we have tested several tracker quintessence models with observational data .",
    "the result showed that the best - fit of the inverse - power - law potential and the inverse - exponential potential models both reduced to the cosmological constant .",
    "motivated by this and the implication of @xmath10 from observations , in this paper we put the phantom dark energy models to the test .",
    "we consider two specific scalar - field phantom potentials : the power - law potential  @xcite and the exponential potential  @xcite , each with one free parameter .",
    "the reason to choose these potentials is that they also possess the attractor - like property : insensitive to initial conditions .",
    "we take the model - based approach to confront the models with observational data .",
    "the data we use includes the latest type - ia supernova ( sn - ia ) compilation set , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) observations .",
    "we also confront these models with the cosmological constant and the quintessence scalar - field models by using the goodness - of - fit test and the information criteria to assess the merit of each model .",
    "phantom dark energy with equation of state @xmath14 is achieved by introducing a negative kinetic energy term in the action . in this way",
    "phantom scalar field is slowly `` rolling up '' the potential .",
    "the energy density and pressure of phantom field can then be given as @xmath15 @xmath16 with @xmath17 in the range @xmath18 .",
    "the evolution of the phantom field is governed by its equation of motion : @xmath19 in which @xmath20 denotes the hubble expansion rate , the dot denotes the derivative w.r.t . the physical time .",
    "assuming a flat universe , the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath21 \\frac{dz'}{1+z ' } \\right ) \\right ] , \\label{fdeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the radiation energy density , @xmath23 is the matter energy density , @xmath24 is the scalar field energy density , @xmath25 is the hubble constant .      in the quintessence scenario , there exists a special  tracker solution \" to which other solutions would converge  @xcite  @xcite . a wide range of initial conditions for @xmath26 and @xmath27 will approach a common evolutionary track of @xmath9 and @xmath28 ; this means the tracker field model is insensitive to its initial conditions . a very large range of initial values of @xmath29 is thus allowed without changing cosmic history .",
    "this property makes the tracker model very interesting to study , because it can alleviate cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "conditions for tracker quintessence are such that @xmath30 and is nearly constant ( @xmath31 ) for a wide range of plausible field initial conditions . here",
    "the prime denotes the derivative w.r.t @xmath26 . under these conditions ,",
    "the tracker solution for quintessence can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the background dominant component in the equation - of - state .",
    "the fact that @xmath34 ensures that @xmath35 , so that at late times dark energy will eventually take over and become dominant .",
    "+ the tracker solution for phantom has been studied in  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "its tracker condition is closely related to that for quintessence : @xmath36 , and is nearly constant . because @xmath37 all the time , the energy density of phantom dark energy either stays the same or grows with time .",
    "this ensures that the dark energy density will eventually take over and become the dominant substance at late times .",
    "the form of its tracker solution is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ trackersol ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the tracker phantom models are also insensitive to initial conditions for phantom scalar field .",
    "one example of tracker phantom is a power - law potential @xmath38 with @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ combinepa ] , we show an example for the tracking behavior of the power - law potential phantom .    ]",
    "the tracker solution is just one type of  attractor solutions \" for scalar fields  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "attractor solutions are the stable critical points of autonomous equations ( re - written from the equation of motion and einstein equation ) to which different initial conditions converge ( see proof in  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite ) . in contrast , the tracker solution is not a usual attractor because its critical point is not fixed , but changes with time when the background fluid dominates .",
    "other than the tracker , there are two additional types of late time attractor solution for the phantom scalar field : the big rip attractor and the de sitter attractor .",
    "these two attractors can only be reached in the future ( when @xmath40 ) ; however we found numerically that the exponential potential model in the big rip attractor case remains insensitive to some range of the initial values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as long as @xmath41 .",
    "this allows certain range of initial @xmath9 , and is thus still worth looking into .",
    "the big rip attractor acquired its name because the attractor solution approaches @xmath13 in the future .",
    "this will cause a catastrophic  big rip \" , where the energy density and the scale factor will blow up within a finite time  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "although this may seem an unappealing feature , it is theoretically permissible and is therefore worthy of investigation .",
    "the condition for the big rip attractor is @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xcite , @xmath44 .",
    "one example is the exponential potential @xmath45 mentioned above .    in this paper , we consider two phantom scalar - field dark energy models : the power - law potential @xmath0 and the exponential potential @xmath1 . for the power - law potential phantom , it has the tracker property . for the exponential potential phantom , there exists an attractor solution that approaches the big rip in the future .",
    "we analyze these two models with observational data , obtain constraints on the model parameter , and assess the merit of the models derived from the best - fit results .",
    "we use observational data from sn - ia , cmb and bao described below .",
    "we use the latest snia dataset , union2.1 compilations , released by the supernova cosmology project that contains 580 sn - ia in the the redshift range of @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "this compilation includes supernova data from  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the dataset provides the distance modulus that contains information of the luminosity distance that can be used to constrain the dark energy .",
    "the distance modulus is defined as following : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hubble - free luminosity distance .",
    "we marginalize @xmath49 over the nuisance parameter @xmath50 by minimizing it with respect to @xmath50 .",

    "we followed  @xcite and use three sets of bao distance dataset : 6dfgs , sdss and wigglez , for our study .",
    "we use the joint analysis of the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) data  @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 , which provides two distance measures of @xmath69 and @xmath70  @xcite , where @xmath71 is the acoustic sound horizon at the drag epoch , @xmath72^{1/3}$ ] .",

    "<S> we confront two types of phantom dark energy potential with observational data . </S>",
    "<S> the models we consider are the power - law potential , @xmath0 , and the exponential potential , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the models to the latest observations from sn - ia , cmb and bao , and obtain tight constraints on parameter spaces . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we apply the goodness - of - fit and the information criteria to compare the fitting results from phantom models with that from the cosmological constant and the quintessence models presented in our previous work . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the cosmological constant is statistically most preferred , while the phantom dark energy fits slightly better than the quintessence does . </S>"
