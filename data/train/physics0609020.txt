    "gibrat  @xcite , building upon the work of the astronomer kapteyn  @xcite , assumed the expected value of the growth rate of a business firm s size to be proportional to the current size of the firm , which is called `` law of proportionate effect ''  @xcite .",
    "several models of proportional growth have been subsequently introduced in economics in order to explain the growth of business firms  @xcite .",
    "simon and co - authors  @xcite extended gibrat s model by introducing an entry process according to which the number of firms rise over time . in simon s framework , the market consists of a sequence of many independent `` opportunities '' which arise over time , each of size unity .",
    "models in this tradition have been challenged by many researchers  @xcite who found that the firm growth distribution is not gaussian but displays a tent shape .",
    "here we introduce a mathematical framework that provides an unifying explanation for the growth of business firms based on the number and size distribution of their elementary constituent components  @xcite .",
    "specifically we present a model of proportional growth in both the number of units and their size and we draw some general implications on the mechanisms which sustain business firm growth  @xcite . according to the model , the probability density function ( pdf ) of growth rates , @xmath4 is laplace @xcite in the center  @xcite with power law tails  @xcite decaying as @xmath6 where @xmath5 .",
    "two key sets of assumptions in the model are described in subsections a ( the number of units @xmath1 in a class grows in proportion to the existing number of units ) and b ( the size of each unit fluctuates in proportion to its size ) .",
    "our goal is to first find @xmath0 , the probability distribution of the number of units in the classes at large @xmath7 , and then find @xmath8p(k ) and the conditional distribution of the class growth rates @xmath9 , which for large @xmath1 converges to a gaussian ..",
    "[ section_pk ] the first set of assumptions @xcite is :    * each class @xmath10 consists of @xmath11 number of units . at time",
    "@xmath12 , there are @xmath13 classes consisting of @xmath14 total number of units .",
    "the initial average number of units in a class is thus @xmath15 .",
    "* at each time step a new unit is created .",
    "thus the number of units at time @xmath7 is @xmath16 . * with birth probability @xmath3 ,",
    "this new unit is assigned to a new class , so that the average number of classes at time @xmath7 is @xmath17 . * with probability @xmath18 , a new unit is assigned to an existing class @xmath10 with probability @xmath19 , so @xmath20 .",
    "this model can be generalized to the case when the units are born at any unit of time @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 , die with probability @xmath23 , and in addition a new class consisting of one unit can be created with probability @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this model can be reduced to the present model if one introduce time @xmath25 and probability @xmath26 .",
    "our goal is to find @xmath0 , the probability distribution of the number of units in the classes at large @xmath7 .",
    "this model in two limiting cases ( i ) @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 and ( ii ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 has exact analytical solutions @xmath33  @xcite and @xmath34  @xcite respectively , in general , an exact analytical solution of this problem can not be presented in a simple close form .",
    "accordingly , we seek for an approximate mean - field type  @xcite solution which can be expressed in simple integrals and even in elementary functions in some limiting cases .",
    "first we will present a known solution of the preferential attachment model in the absence of the influx of new classes  @xcite : @xmath35 , \\label{p_k_old}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37/n(0)$ ] is the average number of units in the old classes at time @xmath7 .",
    "note that the form of the distribution of units in the old classes remains unchanged even in the presence of the new classes , whose creation does not change the preferential attachment mechanism of the old classes and affects only the functional form of @xmath38 .",
    "now we will treat the problem in the presence of the influx of the new classes .",
    "assume that at the beginning there are @xmath13 classes with @xmath14 units .",
    "because at every time step , one unit is added to the system and a new class is added with probability @xmath3 , at moment @xmath7 there are @xmath39 units and approximately @xmath40 classes , among which there are approximately @xmath41 new classes with @xmath42 units and @xmath13 old classes with @xmath43 units , such that @xmath44 because of the preferential attachment assumption  ( a4 ) , we can write , neglecting fluctuations  @xcite and assuming that @xmath7 , @xmath43 , and @xmath42 are continuous variables : @xmath45 solving the second differential equation and taking into account initial condition @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 .",
    "analogously , the number of units at time @xmath7 in the classes existing at time @xmath48 is @xmath49 where the subscript ` e ' means `` existing '' .",

    "( [ p_old_class ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ tilde_p_new_k ] ) are not exact solutions but continuous approximations which assume @xmath1 is a real number .",

    "note that in reality the power - law behavior of @xmath86 extends into the region of very small @xmath1 .",
    "the second set of assumptions of the model is :    * at time @xmath7 , each class @xmath10 has @xmath11 units of size @xmath89 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are independent random variables taken from the distributions @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively .",

    "we also assume that @xmath105 has finite mean @xmath106 and variance @xmath107 .",
    "let us assume that due to the gibrat process , both the size and growth of units ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively ) are distributed lognormally @xmath110 @xmath111 if units grow according to a multiplicative process , the size of units @xmath112 is distributed lognormally with @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "now our goal is to find an analytical approximation for @xmath9 .",
    "according to the central limit theorem , the sum of @xmath1 independent random variables with mean @xmath126 and finite variance @xmath127 is @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the random variable with the distribution converging to gaussian @xmath130 accordingly , we can replace @xmath131 by its tailor s expansion @xmath132 , neglecting the terms of order @xmath82 . because @xmath133 and @xmath134 we have    @xmath135    for large @xmath1 the last term in eq .",

    "( [ p_g_large_k ] ) predicts @xmath169 , where @xmath170 .",
    "this value is much larger than the empirical value @xmath171 observed for the size - variance relationships of various socio - economic entities  @xcite .",
    "however , the slow convergence of @xmath172 suggests that for quite a wide range of @xmath173 , @xmath174 and only at @xmath175 there is a crossover to the theoretical value @xmath176 , ( fig .",

    "this feature of the model growth rates may explain the abundance of the tent - shaped wings of the growth rates of various systems in nature .",
    "the most drastic discrepancy between the gaussian shape and the simulated distribution @xmath9 can be seen when @xmath177 and than it starts to decrease slowly , and remains visible even for @xmath178 .    nevertheless , in order to obtain close form approximations for the growth rate",
    ", we will use the gaussian approximation ( [ p_g_large_k ] ) for @xmath9 .",
    "the distribution of the growth rate of the old classes can be found by eq .",

    "this distribution decays as @xmath181 and thus does not have a finite variance . in spite of drastic assumptions that we make , eq .",

    "figure  [ exp-15 ] shows the comparison of the simulation of the growth rates in the system with the exponential distribution of units @xmath0 with @xmath183 and the same empirical parameters of the unit size and growth distributions as before .",
    "the parameter of the analytical distribution characterizing its width ( variance does not exist ) , must be taken @xmath184 which is much smaller than the analytical prediction @xmath185 .",
    "this is not surprising , since for @xmath186 @xmath187 ( see fig .  [",
    "moreover , since we are dealing with the average @xmath188 for @xmath189 , we can expect @xmath190 .",
    "nevertheless the nature of the power - law wings decaying as @xmath181 is reproduced very well .    for the new classes , when @xmath191 the distribution of number of units is approximated by @xmath192    again replacing summation in eq .",
    "( [ p_g_sum ] ) in the text by integration and @xmath9 by eq .",

    "note that this behavior of the power - law probability density function leads to the power law rank - order distribution where rank of a class @xmath217 is related to the number of its units @xmath1 as @xmath218 thus @xmath219 , where @xmath220 , which leads in the limit @xmath206 to the celebrated zipf s law@xcite for cities populations , @xmath221 .",
    "note that this equation can be derived for our model using elementary considerations .",
    "indeed , due to proportional growth the rank of a class , @xmath217 , is proportional to the time of its creation @xmath48 .",
