    "in the foundations of quantum mechanics , a remarkable achievement of the last years has been the clarification of the differences between _ preparation uncertainty relations _ ( pur ) and _ measurement uncertainty relations _ ( mur )",
    "@xcite , both of them arising from the heisenberg s heuristic considerations about the precision with which the position and the momentum of a quantum particle can be determined @xcite .",
    "one speaks of pur when some lower bound is given on the `` spreads '' of the distributions of two observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 measured in the same state @xmath2 .",
    "the most known formulation of pur , due to robertson @xcite , involves the product of the two standard deviations ; more recent formulations are given in terms of distances among probability distributions @xcite or entropies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one refers to mur when some lower bound is given on the `` errors '' of any approximate joint measurement @xmath3 of two target observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 . when the approximate joint measurement @xmath3 is realized as a sequence of two measurements , one for each target observable , mur",
    "are regarded also as relations between the `` error '' allowed in an approximate measurement of the first observable and the `` disturbance '' affecting the successive measurement of the second one .",
    "although the recent developments of the theory of approximate quantum measurements @xcite and nondisturbing quantum measurements @xcite have generated a considerable renewed interest in mur , no agreement has yet been reached about the proper quantifications of the `` error '' or `` disturbance '' terms . here , the main problem is how to compare the target observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 with their approximate or perturbed versions provided by the marginals @xmath4}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] of @xmath3 ; indeed , @xmath0 , @xmath4}$ ] , @xmath5}$ ] and @xmath1 may typically be incompatible .",
    "the proposals then range from operator formulations of the error @xcite to distances for probability distributions @xcite and conditional entropies @xcite .    in this paper , we propose and develop a new approach to mur based on the notion of _ relative entropy_. here we will deal with the case of discrete observables for a finite dimensional quantum system .    in the spirit of @xcite , we quantify the `` error '' in the approximation @xmath6}$ ] by comparing the respective outcome distributions @xmath7 and @xmath4}^\\rho$ ] in every possible state @xmath2 ; however , differently from @xcite , the comparison is done from the point of view of information theory .",
    "then , the natural choice is to consider @xmath8}^\\rho\\big)}$ ] , the relative entropy of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath4}^\\rho$ ] , as a quantification of the information loss when @xmath7 is approximated with @xmath4}^\\rho$ ] .",
    "similarly , in order to quantify either the `` error '' or  if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are measured in sequence  the `` disturbance '' related to the approximation @xmath9}$ ] , we employ the relative entropy @xmath10}^\\rho\\big)}$ ] .",
    "relative entropy appears to be the fundamental quantity from which the other entropic notions can be derived , cf.@xcite , @xcite ; we recall its relevant properties in section [ sec : c - ent ] .",
    "it should be noticed that the relative entropy , of classical or quantum type , has already been used in quantum measurement theory to give proper measures of information gains and losses in various scenarios @xcite .",
    "the main difference between our relative entropy approach and the conditional entropy approach of @xcite is that we do not need any joint distribution for @xmath7 , @xmath4}^\\rho$ ] , @xmath5}^\\rho$ ] and @xmath11 , which indeed would not exist for incompatible observables .",
    "the relative entropy formulation of mur is : for every approximate joint measurement @xmath3 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , there exists a state @xmath2 such that @xmath12}\\big)}+{s\\big({\\mathsf{b}}^{\\rho}\\|{\\mathsf{m}}^{\\rho}_{[2]}\\big)}\\geq c({\\mathsf{a}},{\\mathsf{b}}),\\ ] ] where the uncertainty lower bound @xmath13}\\big)}+{s\\big({\\mathsf{b}}^{\\rho}\\|{\\mathsf{m}}^{\\rho}_{[2]}\\big)}\\big\\}\\ ] ] depends on the allowed joint measurements @xmath3 .",
    "we stress that , in the above definition , the same state @xmath2 appears in both the error terms @xmath14}\\big)}$ ] and @xmath15}\\big)}$ ] ; thus , all possible error compensations are taken into account in the maximization .",
    "this is essentially different from the approach of @xcite , where instead the two errors are maximized in separate stages .    by considering any possible approximate joint measurement in the definition of @xmath16",
    ", we get an uncertainty lower bound @xmath17 that turns out to be a proper measure of the incompatibility of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . on the other hand , by considering only sequential measurements , we derive an uncertainty lower bound @xmath18 that provides a suitable quantification of the error / disturbance tradeoff for the two ( sequentially ordered ) target observables . indeed",
    ", such lower bounds share a lot of desirable properties : they are zero if and only if the target observables are compatible ( respectively , sequentially compatible ) ; they are invariant under unitary transformations and relabelling of the output values of the measurements ; and finally they are bounded from above by a value that is independent of both the dimension of the hilbert space and the number of the possible outcomes . as a main result , we show also that , for a generic couple of observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , considering only their sequential measurements is a real restriction , because in general @xmath18 may be larger than @xmath17 ; actually , the two indexes are guaranteed to coincide only if one makes some extra assumptions on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for example , if the second observable @xmath1 is supposed to be sharp .",
    "thus , every time @xmath0 and @xmath1 are incompatible , the total loss of information @xmath14}\\big)}+{s\\big({\\mathsf{b}}^{\\rho}\\|{\\mathsf{m}}^{\\rho}_{[2]}\\big)}$ ] in the approximations @xmath6}$ ] and @xmath9}$ ] depends on both the joint measurement @xmath3 and the state @xmath2 ; however , since @xmath19 , we prove that there is a minimum potential loss that no joint measurement @xmath3 can avoid .",
    "similar remarks hold for sequential joint measurements and the corresponding error / disturbance tradeoff .",
    "whenever @xmath0 and @xmath1 are incompatible , we will look for the exact value of @xmath17 , or at least some lower bound for it , as well as we will try to determine the optimal approximate joint measurements @xmath3 which saturate the minimum .",
    "in particular , we will prove that in some relevant applications there is actually a unique such @xmath3 , thus showing that in these cases the entropic optimality criterium unambiguously fixes the best approximate joint measurement .",
    "the generalization of the relative entropy formulation of mur to the case of more than two target observables is rather straightforward , and it will be illustrated at the end of the paper .",
    "it is worth noticing that there are triples of observables whose optimal approximate joint measurements are not unique , even if all their possible pairings do have the corresponding binary uniqueness property ( see e.g. the two and three orthogonal spin-1/2 components in section [ ex : d2 ] and example [ ex:3spin ] ) .",
    "now , we briefly summarize the content of the paper . in section",
    "[ sec : indices ] , we introduce and study the entropic divergence @xmath20 of an arbitrary approximate joint measurement @xmath3 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from its two target observables , that is , the sum @xmath21}\\big ) } + { s\\big({\\mathsf{b}}^\\rho\\| { \\mathsf{m}}^\\rho_{[2]}\\big)}$ ] evaluated at the worst possible system state @xmath2 .",
    "this gives the state - independent quantification of the total `` error '' made with the approximate joint measurement @xmath3 at hand .",
    "then we find the uncertainty lower bounds @xmath17 and @xmath18 by considering the best approximate joint measurement @xmath3 and we prove their general properties . in section [ sec :",

    "some general results are proved , which show how the symmetry properties of the quantum system can help in the task .",
