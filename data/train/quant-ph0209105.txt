    "<S> in this paper , the generating of entanglement by using some biparticle bose systems acting on vacuum state are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> these systems include two - mode squeezed system , thermal system of a free single particle ( where the fictitious tilde system is regarded another particle ) , and the system of two coupling harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the technique of integration within an ordered product ( iwop ) of operators is used .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : entanglement ; biparticle bose system    pacs numbers : 06.35.-w ; 06.35.ud    entanglement has been recognized as a central resource in various aspects of quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum teleportation teleportation , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite etc . </S>",
    "<S> are all based on the entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> so producing entanglement of quantum systems is one of the basic tasks for quantum communication and quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that nonlocal operations can generate entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> recently , many authors have studied the generating of entanglement from simple quantum gates , for example , cnot gate , double cnot gate and swap gate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the produced entanglement from these quantum gates is the entanglement of qubit systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , recently , quantum information protocols have extended from qubit systems to continuous variable systems , such as continuous variable teleportation , @xcite continuous variable quantum computation @xcite and error correction @xcite , and continuous variable cryptography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is interested to produce entanglement from continuous variable quantum systems . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will try to study the generating of entanglement from some non - qubit bose systems by using the technique of integration within an ordered product ( iwop ) of operators . </S>",
    "<S> follows the original works of fan iwopfan01 we firstly list the rules of iwop of operators as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(i ) the order of bose operators within a normally ordered product ( denoted by symbol : :) can be permuted .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) if and only if the normally ordered form of operators can be put into and out of the symbol : : unchangeably .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) c numbers can be taken into and out of the symbol : : as one wishes .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iv ) a normally ordered product can be integrated or differentiated with respect to c - number provided the integration is convergent .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(v ) the normally ordered form of projector of vacuum state is @xmath0where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are creation and annihilation operators of bose system in fock space .    at first </S>",
    "<S> , we study the generating of entanglement by two - mode squeezed operator acting on vacuum state . the scheme for generating </S>",
    "<S> two - mode squeezed operator has been studied in last years and recently by using a pair distant cavities @xcite . because the two - mode squeezed operator is @xmath3 the created entangled state from vacuum state is just the two - mode squeezed vacuum state@xmath4where </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is the squeezing parameter , @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 are the creation and ( annihilation ) operators of the two particles . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of entanglement of @xmath10 has been given by many authors @xcite , @xcite @xcite . where we investigate it with iwop of operators . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the normally ordered form of two - mode squeezed operator is @xcite@xmath11so we have@xmath12where and in the following we use the superscript `` tms '' denoting `` two - mode squeezed '' . </S>",
    "<S> the reduce density matrix of @xmath13 is@xmath14by using the completeness of coherent state @xmath15 @xmath16we have@xmath17use of the formula@xmath18we obtain@xmath19because @xmath20replacing eq.([eq10 ] ) into eq.([eq9 ] ) we have @xcite@xmath21so the entanglement denoted by von neumann entropy of @xmath22 is@xmath23from the relationship@xmath24we have@xmath25from eq.([eq14 ] ) we can plot @xmath26 with the parameter @xmath5 as figure 1@xmath27from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we see that the entanglement @xmath26 increase with the increasing of squeezed parameter @xmath28 which is coincided with the result obtained by other methods @xcite , @xcite squeezed2 .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we study the generating of entanglement of free single particle in thermal environment . in 1975 , </S>",
    "<S> takahashi and umezawa @xcite pointed out that the statistical average of physical quantity @xmath29 at the temperature t can be expressed as@xmath30where the thermal quantum vacuum state @xmath31 is defined by@xmath32here , we have@xmath33for the relevant hamiltonian @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the @xmath36 eigenstate of the hamiltonian with the eigenvalue @xmath37 , and the @xmath38 is the corresponding eigenstate in the fictitious dynamical system identical to the original system . </S>",
    "<S> it is recently pointed out that the fictitious ( tilde ) system @xmath39 in fact denotes the system of environment @xcite ( in which it is regarded as one particle ) . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal vacuum state @xmath40 is usually a entangled state and the entanglement is that between the system of interest and its environment . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the entanglement of thermal state of a free boson . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of free boson is @xmath41 and its thermal vacuum state is @xmath42then @xmath43where and in the following the superscript `` tv '' denotes thermal vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> the reduce density matrix of the system ( indicated by subscript @xmath44 is@xmath45by using the completeness of coherent state @xmath46 of the fictitious system@xmath47we have@xmath48so we can calculate its entanglement as@xmath49the entanglement @xmath50 with temperature t plotted in figure 2.@xmath51it is shown that when @xmath52 @xmath53 which shows that the free single particle do not entangle with its environment at very low temperature and when the temperature increase the entanglement emerges . in the room temperature the entanglement increase with the increasing of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this result is physically reasonable .    </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , we calculate the entanglement of two coupling harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> this system can model some molecules through modeling atoms with harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest form of two coupling harmonic oscillator system has the hamiltonian as@xmath54here , @xmath55 denotes the mass and the @xmath56 denotes the frequency of particles ( suppose they are same for the two particles ) , @xmath57 denotes the coupling constant and @xmath58when this system acting on the vacuum state , the eigenstate of energy is @xmath59 where @xcite @xmath60here,@xmath61@xmath62by using iwop one can obtain @xcite @xmath63where@xmath64thus , the density matrix under the operator @xmath65 acting on vacuum state is@xmath66where and in the following the superscript `` cho '' denotes coupling harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> so we have@xmath67suppose the temperature of the two - atom molecule is very low , there are only two level in the atoms then the density matrix becomes@xmath68from this density matrix we can calculate the entropy entanglement of this system , it is@xmath69from eq.([eq33 ] ) we can plot @xmath70 with squeezed parameter @xmath71 as figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72it is shown that the entanglement take its maximum at @xmath73 a furthermore calculation shows that when the temperature raise and the level of each harmonic oscillators more than two , for example @xmath74 , the density matrix @xmath75 becomes a matrix of @xmath76 when @xmath74 big enough , this problem will become very difficult . </S>",
    "<S> so , in order to calculate the entanglement of this system a better method is expected .    in this paper , by using the results of normally ordered forms of operators and the iwop of operators we calculated the generating of entanglement from biparticle bose systems acting on vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> these systems include two - mode squeezed system , free single particle in the thermal environment , and two coupling harmonic oscillators system . </S>",
    "<S> the generating of entanglement by two mode squeezed operator acting on vacuum state is equal to the entanglement of two - mode squeezed vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> our result is coincided with that has been obtained by many authors . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement produced from free single particle in thermal environment is one between the particle and the environment , which is obtained rigorously by using our method . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement of coupled two harmonic oscillators is the entanglement between one particle and the other . by using our result </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain the approximate degree of entanglement of this system at arbitrarily accurate degree , theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> of course , it is difficult when these particles in a higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that iwop is a useful tool for the investigating of generating of entanglement on biparticle bose systems .    </S>",
