    "the inflationary scenario  @xcite has been invented in order to solve and explain some observational facts ( isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ",
    "cmbr , flatness of the space - like sections , etc  ) that could not be properly understood in the context of the standard hot big bang theory .",
    "therefore , at the beginning of its history , the inflationary scenario was only able to make postdictions but , given the problems of the standard model at that time , this was already a success .",
    "however , soon after its advent , it was realized  @xcite that inflation , when combined with quantum mechanics , can also give a very convincing mechanism for structure formation .",
    "in particular , for the first time , it was understood how to generate a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "therefore , the inflationary mechanism was able to establish a beautiful connection between facts which , before , were considered as independent . however , since the harisson - zeldovich was already known to be in agreement with the observations , it could be argued that , somehow , this was again a postdiction .",
    "in fact , the inflationary scenario does not predict a scale invariant spectrum but a nearly scale invariant spectrum , the deviations from the scale invariance being linked to the microphysics description of the theory .",
    "this constitutes a definite prediction of inflation that can be tested  @xcite .",
    "slightly more than twenty years after the invention of inflation , the situation has recently changed because , thanks to the high accuracy cmbr data obtained , among others , by the wmap satellite  @xcite , we can now start to probe the details of the inflationary scenario and check its predictions .",
    "the goal of this short review is , after having tried to justify why the inflationary mechanism is generic ( section i ) , to show how , in its most popular and simplest realization , one can calculate concrete predictions ( section ii ) and compare them with the recent observations ( section iii ) .",
    "these proceedings , due to the lack of space , do not cover many important topics . among them and since this is particularly relevant for the present article , we just would like to signal the discussion of why the presence of the cmbr doppler peaks strongly suggests that a phase of inflation took place in the early universe , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological principle implies that the universe is , on large scales , homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this simple assumption drastically constrains the possible shapes of the universe which can solely be described by the friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the metric of the three - dimensional space - like sections of constant curvature .",
    "the time - dependent function @xmath2 is the scale factor .",
    "if the spatial curvature vanishes then @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the krnecker symbol .",
    "the previous expression is written in terms of the cosmic time @xmath5 but it is also interesting to work in terms of the conformal time @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 . then , the metric can be re - expressed as @xmath8\\ , .\\ ] ] in terms of conformal time , the hubble parameter @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , a dot denoting a derivative with respect to cosmic time while a prime stands for a derivative with respect to conformal time .",
    "the matter is assumed to be a collection of @xmath12 perfect fluids and , as a consequence , its stress - energy tensor is given by the following expression @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ( total ) energy density and @xmath15 the ( total ) pressure .",
    "these two quantities are linked by the equation of state , @xmath16 [ in general , there is an equation of state per fluid considered , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 .",
    "the vector @xmath18 is the four velocity common to all fluids and satisfies the relation @xmath19 . in terms of cosmic time",
    "this means that @xmath20 whereas in terms of conformal time one has @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the fact that the stress - energy tensor is conserved , @xmath23 , implies @xmath24 .",
    "this expression is obtained from the time - time component of the conservation equation .",
    "the time - space and space - space components do not lead to any interesting equations for the background .",
    "we are now in a position to write down the einstein equations which are just differential equations determining the scale factor . in terms of cosmic time",
    ", they read @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the planck mass and where @xmath28 is the normalized three - dimensional curvature . combining the two expressions above , one obtains an equation which permits to express the acceleration of the scale factor @xmath29 . from the above equation , one sees that any form of matter such that @xmath30 will cause an acceleration of the scale factor ( this is only true , of course , if the matter component satisfying @xmath30 is the dominant one ) .",
    "the energy density is always positive but , in some situation , the pressure can be negative and the inequality @xmath31 may be realized .",
    "this simple remark is at the heart of the inflationary scenario .",
    "let us notice that the above property is deeply rooted into the fundamental principles of general relativity .",
    "it is because all forms of energy weighs in general relativity that the pressure participates to the equation giving the expression of @xmath32 .",
    "this has to be contrasted with newtonian physics where the same expression reads @xmath33 , _",
    "i.e. _ only the energy density affects the expansion . as a consequence",
    ", the expansion can only be decelerated .",
    "a class of solutions of particular interest is that for which the equation of state @xmath34 is a constant . in this case , the conservation equation can be immediately integrated and leads to @xmath35 . then , the scale factor is given by a power law either of the conformal or of the cosmic time , namely @xmath36 where the sign of the conformal and cosmic times , to be discussed below , can be negative or positive .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath37 are related by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the link between @xmath40 and the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath41 the cases @xmath42 and/or @xmath43 are obviously meaningless since they do not correspond to a dynamical scale factor .",
    "let us now come back to the question of the sign of the conformal and cosmic times .",
    "for the class of models under consideration , the hubble parameter can be easily calculated and is given by @xmath44 .",
    "let us first consider the case where we have an expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of a contraction , @xmath50 , we have @xmath46 for @xmath49 and @xmath48 for @xmath47 . the link between the two times , @xmath51 ,",
    "takes the form @xmath52 from which we deduce that , if @xmath46 , then @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 and that , if @xmath48 , then @xmath55 for @xmath54 and @xmath53 for @xmath56 .",
    "finally , let us also examine some cases of particular interest .",
    "the case @xmath57 corresponds to an expanding matter dominated universe and @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath55 and @xmath46 .",
    "the same conclusion applies for the case @xmath59 , _",
    "i.e. _ the case of an expanding radiation dominated universe with @xmath60 .",
    "the case @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath62 , that is to say to an exponential scale factor : this is just the de sitter solution with @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath64 , one has @xmath54 and @xmath53 , @xmath46 if we are interested in the case of expansion",
    ".    the evolution of the background space - time can be very roughly understood by means of the previous set of simple equations .",
    "the hot big bang model before the advent of inflation just consisted into a radiation dominated epoch ( @xmath60 ) taking place at high redshifts , until @xmath65 , followed by a phase dominated by cold matter ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "however , already at this level , this very simple framework leads to unacceptable conclusions .",
    "we now describe what are ( some of ) the problems of the pre - inflationary hot big bang scenario and how postulating a new phase of accelerated expansion in the very early universe can avoid these problems .",
    "the horizon problem consists in the following .",
    "the furthest event that we can directly `` see '' in the universe is the ( re)combination , _ i.e. _ the time at which the electrons and the protons combined to form hydrogen atoms . since the photon ",
    "atom cross - section ( rayleigh cross - section ) is much smaller than the photon  electron cross - section ( thomson cross - section ) , the universe became transparent at that time .",
    "the cobe  @xcite and wmap  @xcite maps of the sky are photographs of the universe at this epoch .",
    "the recombination took place at a redshift of @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _ within the epoch dominated by the cold matter .",
    "before , the universe was opaque and therefore it is not possible to observe it directly at earlier times from the earth . since no physical process can act on scales larger than the horizon ( see below for a precise definition of the horizon ) , we typically expect the universe to be strongly inhomogeneous on those scales .",
    "seen from the earth , this means that the cobe map should look extremely different on angular scales larger than the angular scale of the horizon at recombination .    in order to investigate the consequences of the above statement ,",
    "let us calculate the angular diameter of the horizon at recombination , seen by an observer today .",
    "roughly speaking , this is just the size of the horizon at the last scattering surface divided by the present ( angular ) distance to the last scattering surface . in other words , it can be expressed as @xmath67 , where we now discuss precisely the meaning of the terms in the above formula .    for this purpose",
    ", it is convenient to choose the coordinates system such that the origin is located on earth , _ i.e. _ such that `` our '' co - moving coordinate is @xmath68 .",
    "suppose that a photon is emitted at spatial co - moving coordinates @xmath69 and at cosmic time @xmath70 .",
    "the path followed by the photon can be chosen such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 since this is a solution of the geodesic equation .",
    "in this case , the path is completely characterized by the function @xmath73 .",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath74\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the physical ( proper ) distance from the `` position '' of the photon at time @xmath5 to the origin .",
    "this equation can be used to define the horizon .",
    "indeed , the question that one may ask is the following .",
    "at a given ( reception ) time , @xmath76 , what is the proper distance to the furthest point where a photon , sent to us from there , could have reached the earth ( the point of co - moving coordinate @xmath68 ) before or at the time @xmath77 ? this proper distance is called the size of the horizon at time @xmath76 .",
    "clearly the distance is maximized if the time of emission is the big - bang and if the photon has just reached the earth at the time @xmath78 .",
    "hence the co - moving coordinate of emission is obtained by writing that @xmath79 and by taking a vanishing lower bound in the previous integral .",
    "this implies that @xmath80 this means that the distance to the horizon , at the time @xmath81 , is given by @xmath82 .",
    "in this equation , @xmath78 can be for instance the time of recombination , @xmath83 or the present time @xmath84 depending on whether one wants the evaluate the size of horizon at the last scattering surface or now .",
    "another question is to calculate the distance to a point where a photon emitted at @xmath85 has just arrived on earth now , at time @xmath86 .",
    "writing again that the photon is received now , one obtains the corresponding co - moving coordinate of emission @xmath87 . from the previous equation , one can deduce that the corresponding angular distance to the point of emission is given by @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , the flrw metric can be written as ( for flat space - like section ) @xmath89 and therefore the proper distance @xmath90 across a source is @xmath91 at time @xmath70 ( obtained from @xmath92 since it is supposed that the source is located on a sphere of radius @xmath93 ) . as a consequence",
    ", one has @xmath94 from which we deduce @xmath95 .",
    "notice that the proper distance to the point of emission is @xmath96 .",
    "for very high redshifts , as for instance @xmath97 , these two distances are of course very different .",
    "we can now deduce the general expression of the angular diameter .",
    "it is given by @xmath98\\times \\biggl[\\int _ { t_{\\rm lss}}^{t_0 } \\frac{{\\rm d}\\tau}{a(\\tau)}\\biggr]^{-1}\\ , .\\ ] ] in the previous expression , the factors @xmath99 have canceled out .",
    "let us now try to evaluate the above solid angle in a realistic case where matter and radiation are present  @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the universe is radiation dominated before recombination and matter dominated after . in reality , as already mentioned , equivalence between radiation and matter takes place before the recombination but this does not introduce important corrections .",
    "since we are going to study the influence of a phase of inflation , we also assume that the epoch dominated by radiation can be interrupted during the period @xmath100 . during this interval",
    ", we assume that the universe is dominated by an unknown fluid the equation of state of which is constant and given by @xmath101 .",
    "to recover the standard hot big bang case , where this epoch does not occur , it is sufficient to consider that @xmath102 , _ i.e. _ to switch off the phase dominated by the unknown fluid .",
    "the scale factor is not known exactly but its piecewise expression reads :    @xmath103^{2/[3(1+\\omega _ { _ { \\rm x}})]}\\ , ,   \\quad t_{\\rm i}\\le t < t_{\\rm end}\\ , ,   \\\\ a(t ) & = & a_{\\rm end}[2h_{\\rm end}(t - t_{\\rm end})+1]^{1/2}\\ , ,   \\quad t_{\\rm end}\\le t <",

    "a straightforward calculation leads to the expressions of the horizon at decoupling and of the angular distance to the last scattering surface .",

    "let us first suppose that there is no phase of inflation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath110 .",
    "then , @xmath111 .         as a consequence ,",
    "one expects the last scattering surface to be made of @xmath112 patches whose physical properties are completely different ( let us remind that the angular diameter of the moon seen from the earth is @xmath113 ) .",
    "this is obviously not the case : up to tiny fluctuations of order @xmath114 , the cmb radiation is extremely homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this paradox is called the horizon problem . a solution to this problem",
    "is to assume that the initial conditions were identical in all the causally disconnected patches but this seems very difficult to justify .",
    "another solution is to switch on the inflationary phase . to significantly modify the solid angle in eq .",
    "( [ solid ] ) , the unknown fluid responsible for inflation must have an equation of state such that @xmath115 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath116 , then the argument of the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ solid ] ) is negative and the correction coming from the phase driven by the unknown fluid becomes negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath117 , then the correction can be very important , depending of course on the value of the number of e - folds @xmath12 .",
    "writing that the last scattering surface looks very isotropic , that is to say @xmath118 , allows us to put a constraint on this quantity .",
    "one obtains @xmath119 .",
    "notice that it is necessary to assume that @xmath120 is not too close to @xmath121 otherwise terms like @xmath122 , that we have neglected , could also have an effect on the constraint derived above .",
    "let us now try to better understand and to physically interpret what has been done .",

    "obviously , this number does not depend on the fact that there is a phase of inflation or not . on the other hand ,",

    "this is why , in the left panel in fig .",
    "[ hordiag ] , the ( black ) horizon and the ( blue ) last scattering surface have about the same size .",
    "the horizon at recombination has been calculated in eq .",
    "( [ horizonlss ] ) .",
    "if there is no phase of inflation then one has @xmath129 .",
    "this is why in the left panel in fig .",
    "[ hordiag ] , the red and the green circles are small in comparison with the blue circle representing the last scattering surface .",
    "this is also the heart of the horizon problem : without a phase of inflation , the horizon at recombination is too small in comparison with the last scattering surface and , as a consequence , its angular size is only @xmath130 as we have calculated previously .",
    "let us now turn to the inflationary solution and the right panel in fig .",
    "[ hordiag ] . the proper distance to the last scattering surface",
    "is not modified .",
    "but , and this is the crucial point , the size of the horizon is now completely different . using eq .",
    "( [ horizonlss ] ) , with now @xmath117 , we obtain @xmath131\\gg d_{\\rm lss}\\ , .\\ ] ] this is why in the right panel in fig .",
    "[ hordiag ] the ( green ) horizon now encompasses the ( blue ) last scattering surface .",
    "another consequence is that the ( black ) horizon today is now much bigger than the hubble scale which , as already mentioned , is still approximatively equal to the size of the blue last scattering surface . for the purpose of illustration let us take the example of chaotic inflation . in this case",
    "we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 from which we deduce that ( ! ) @xmath134 .",
    "clearly this scale is totally different from the hubble scale and , in the context of an inflationary universe , one should carefully make the difference between those two scales .",
    "this problem becomes more apparent if the friedman equation is cast into a different form .",
    "let us define the parameter @xmath135 , which gives the relative contribution of the fluid `` i '' to the total amount of energy density present in the universe , by @xmath136 , where the critical energy density is @xmath137 .",
    "this last quantity is nothing but the total energy density of a universe with flat space - like sections .",
    "this is a time - dependent quantity .",
    "the friedman equation takes the form @xmath138 .",
    "the parameter @xmath139 directly gives the sign of the curvature of the space - like sections .",
    "since @xmath140 is not a function of time , the sign of @xmath141 can not change during the cosmic evolution .",
    "in general , it is difficult to solve the differential equation giving the time evolution of @xmath142(t ) and to obtain the explicit time dependence of @xmath142 .",
    "however , it is possible to express @xmath143 in terms of the scale factor @xmath2 , at least in the case where all the fluids have a constant equation of state parameter .",
    "one obtains    @xmath144\\left(\\frac{a}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-2}\\right\\}^{-1}\\ , .\\ ] ]    if one assumes that only radiation and matter are present then , as @xmath145 goes to zero , it is clear that radiation becomes dominant . in this case ,",
    "a good approximation of the previous equation is @xmath146 today it is known that @xmath147 .",
    "this clearly means that , at high redshifts , the quantity @xmath148 was extremely close to zero .",
    "for instance , at the redshift of nucleosynthesis , @xmath149 , one has @xmath150 where we have taken @xmath151 .",
    "it is difficult to understand why this quantity was so fine - tuned in the early universe . at grand",
    "unified theory ( gut ) scale ( @xmath152 ) , the constraint becomes even worse @xmath153 .",
    "to explain this fact , we have two possible solutions : ( i ) we simply assume that the initial conditions were fine - tuned in the early universe or ( ii ) we find a mechanism which automatically produces such a small value at high redshifts .",
    "since , as already mentioned for the horizon problem , the first explanation seems artificial , let us concentrate on the second one .",
    "thus , we assume that , for redshifts @xmath154 , the universe was dominated by another type of matter , different from matter or radiation .",
    "we simply characterize this unknown fluid @xmath155 by its equation of state @xmath101 .",
    "the equation of state should be chosen such that , from any reasonable ( i.e. not fine - tuned ) initial conditions in the very early universe",
    "@xmath156 , it automatically produces a @xmath157 close to zero , with the required accuracy at @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath143 can be written as @xmath159 \\left(\\displaystyle{\\frac{a}{a_{\\rm i}}}\\right)^ { 1 + 3\\omega _ { _ { \\rm x } } } } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is the value of the scale factor at some initial redshift @xmath161 . since @xmath162 ,",
    "the condition @xmath163 is clearly equivalent to @xmath117 .",
    "then , from any initial conditions at @xmath164 , the value of @xmath165 will be pushed toward one as long as @xmath155 dominates .",
    "therefore , one recovers the fact that a fluid with a negative equation of state parameter can solve a problem of the hot big bang model .",
    "one can even derive the constraint that the parameters describing the epoch dominated by the fluid @xmath155 must satisfy .",
    "if one requires that @xmath166 has been pushed so close to one during the phase dominated by @xmath155 that the remaining difference @xmath141 will not sufficiently increased during the radiation and dominated epochs to compensate the first effect and to be distinguishable from zero today , one arrives at [ from eqs .",
    "( [ ombb ] ) and ( [ ominf ] ) written at @xmath167 @xmath168 which can also be expressed as @xmath169 , where we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath170 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that this constraint be the same as the one derived from the requirement that the horizon problem is solved .",
    "to conclude , let us give some numerical examples : for @xmath171 , _",
    "i.e. _ two orders of magnitude above nucleosynthesis , one has @xmath172 that is to say @xmath173 e - foldings . for @xmath174 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath175 , namely @xmath176 e - foldings .",
    "the main lesson of the previous calculations is that , assuming an epoch in the early universe dominated by a fluid the equation of state parameter of which is negative , provides an elegant way to solve the problems of the standard hot big bang model . here",
    ", the important point is that the detailed properties of the unknown fluid and/or its physical nature are unimportant , at least at the background level , provided the equation of state parameter is negative .",
    "this makes the inflationary solution quite generic .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that inflation can be caused by any fluid such that @xmath30 .",
    "we now discuss a concrete realization of the inflationary mechanism .",
    "inflation is supposed to take place in the very early universe , at very high energies . at those scales , the fluid description of matter",
    "is not expected to hold anymore and ( quantum ) field theory seems to be the most appropriate way to describe the behavior of matter .",
    "the simplest example , compatible with the symmetries of the flrw metric , is a scalar field @xmath177 .",
    "this field will be called the inflaton in what follows .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian reads @xmath178\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath179 is the potential , _ a priori _ a free function but we will see that , in order to have a successful inflationary phase , its shape must satisfy some constraints . the stress - energy tensor can be written as @xmath180\\ , .\\ ] ] from this expression , one sees that the scalar field can also be viewed as a perfect fluid .",
    "the energy density and the pressure are defined according to @xmath181 and @xmath182 and read @xmath183 the conservation equation can be obtained by inserting the previous expressions of the energy density and pressure into eq .  ( [ conservation ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath184 , this reproduces the klein - gordon equation written in a flrw background , namely @xmath185 as already mentioned before , the other equation of conservation expresses the fact that the scalar field is homogeneous and therefore does not bring any new information .",
    "finally , a comment is in order about the equation of state . in general",
    ", there is no simple link between @xmath14 and @xmath15 except when the kinetic energy dominates the potential energy where @xmath186 , _",
    "i.e. _ the case of stiff matter or , on the contrary , when the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy for which one obtains @xmath187 .",
    "this last case is of course the most interesting for our purpose .",
    "this shows that inflation corresponds to a regime where the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy : @xmath188 , see eqs .",
    "( [ rhopsf ] ) .",
    "we also note in passing that an equation of state @xmath189 implies that the energy density of the field will be almost constant during inflation .",
    "the fact that the kinetic energy is small during inflation means that the potential should be very flat which is the main requirement for a successful model of inflation if this one is caused by a scalar field .",
    "in general , the equations of motion can be integrated exactly only for a very restricted class of potentials . on the contrary",
    ", one would like to able to characterize this motion for any given , sufficiently flat , potentials . to reach this goal",
    ", we clearly need a scheme of approximation .",
    "since the kinetic energy to potential energy ratio and the scalar field acceleration to the scalar field velocity ratio are small , this suggests to view these two ratios as parameters in which a systematic expansion is performed .",
    "the slow - roll motion of the scalar field is controlled by the three `` slow - roll parameters '' ( at leading order , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) defined by :    @xmath190    some remarks are in order at this point .",
    "first of all , we have introduced a third slow - roll parameters , @xmath191 .",

    "this suggests a new interpretation of the slow - roll approximation : the slow - roll parameters controls the deviation of the inflaton potential from perfect flatness ( the case of a cosmological constant ) and hence are given by the successive field derivatives of the potential .    yet another way to see",
    "the slow - roll approximation is the following .",
    "the perfect slow - low regime is when the inflaton potential is a constant , _",
    "i.e. _ is exactly flat . in this case , one has @xmath200 and the corresponding solution of the einstein equations is the de sitter space - time with the scale factor @xmath201 .",
    "somehow , the slow - roll approximation is an expansion around this solution . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the exact equation : @xmath202 which comes directly from the definition of @xmath203 written in terms of the conformal time .",

    "we will see that the second slow - roll parameters will show up in the calculation when we consider inflationary cosmological perturbations .",

    "one immediately obtains that the hubble radius is constant during inflation while it varies as @xmath262 during the radiation era and as @xmath263 during the matter dominated era .",
    "initially , the physical wavelengths are therefore smaller than the hubble radius ( in principle even smaller than the planck length , see below ) but because of the inflationary expansion of the background they become , at some point , larger than the hubble radius .",
    "the time at which a fourier mode exits the hubble radius depends on the co - moving wavenumber of the corresponding mode .",
    "they will re - enter the hubble radius later on , either during the radiation or matter dominated epochs because the hubble radius behave differently during those eras .",
    "it is worth noticing that , without a phase of inflation , the modes would have always been outside the hubble radius . the fact that there is a regime where the modes are",
    "sub - hubble is therefore a specific feature of the inflationary background and plays a crucial role in our ability to fix well - defined initial conditions .",
    "the evolution of a fourier mode is represented in fig .",
    "[ scaleinf ] .",
    "it is also interesting to remark than the physical wavelengths are always inside the horizon which they never exit .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to distinguish the horizon from the hubble scale .",
    "in fact it is possible to prove that , as soon as a scale is inside the horizon , it will remain so for ever .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the ratio of the horizon to the physical scale at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath264 where @xmath140 is the co - moving wavenumber of the scale under consideration .",
    "the first term is by assumption greater than one and the second one is positive , hence the above - mentioned statement    looking at the equation of motion , one sees that , _ a priori _ , the behavior of the solution is not controlled by the hubble scale as often said in the literature ( sometimes , it is also claimed that the horizon determines the qualitative behavior of the solutions ! ) but by the scale @xmath260 , _ i.e. _ by the shape of the effective potential .",
    "however , it turns out that , for slow - roll inflation ( in fact for power - law inflation ) , the behaviors of @xmath260 and @xmath265 are similar and , therefore , the concepts of hubble and potential scales can be used almost interchangeably in this situation .",

    ", the typical form of the potential is given by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ potdp ] .",
    "the exact form of the potential during the transition ( _ i.e. _ during the reheating ) is very complicated and has not been taken into account here .",
    "a smooth interpolation has been assumed between the two eras .",
    "the two regimes described before re - appear in a different way .",
    "initially , a given mode is above the barrier .",

    "the times of hubble and potential crossings are not the same but , as already mentioned , in the case of slow - roll inflation they are of the same order of magnitude .",

    "let us notice that this is valid as long as the details of the reheating process only modify the shape of the potential such that the modes of interest always remain below the potential during the transition from inflation to radiation .",

    "in fact , this problem bears a close resemblance with a situation discussed by atomic physicists at the time quantum mechanics was born .",

    "apart from the term @xmath300 and up to the identification @xmath301 , the effective frequency has exactly the same form as @xmath302 during inflation .",
    "therefore , calculating the evolution of cosmological perturbations on super - hubble scales ( _ i.e. _ @xmath291 ) is similar to determining the behavior of the hydrogen atom wave function in the vicinity of the nucleus ( _ i.e. _ @xmath303 ) .",
    "the calculation of the energy levels by means of the wkb approximation was first addressed by kramers @xcite and by young and uhlenbeck @xcite .",
    "they noticed that the balmer formula was not properly recovered but did not realize that this was due to a misuse of the wkb approximation . in @xmath304",

    "however , if one assumes that @xmath374 , which is the case in concrete models of hybrid inflation , then one can deduce some general features of the model . in particular , one can calculate the ratio of the two slow - roll parameters @xmath375 this means that this type of models are such that @xmath376 and @xmath377 .    .",
    "the dotted lines are the lines of constant spectral index .",
    "the full lines represent the location of the large field models .",
    "the small field models are concentrated along the @xmath378 axis whereas the exponential models are along the @xmath370 line .",
    "hybrid models have @xmath377 and @xmath376.,width=343,height=302 ]    the results are summarized in fig .  [ srspace ] where the plan @xmath379 is represented .",
    "the aim of this section is to illustrate the fact that the high - accuracy data that are now at our disposal are now starting to discriminate among the various models of inflation presented in the last sections .",
    "the constraints coming from the most recently released cmb data , _",
    "i.e. _ the wmap data  @xcite , are represented in fig .",
    "[ e1e2 ] following the analysis performed in ref .",
    "very roughly speaking , we have the constraints @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "as is clear from the previous analysis , except for a few models ( like , for instance , the quadratic small field model or the exponential potential ) , the determination of the slow - roll parameters requires the calculation of @xmath339 which in turns demands the knowledge of the whole history of the universe . unfortunately all the details of this history are not known and hence there exits important uncertainties with regards to the precise value of @xmath339 in a particular model .",
    "this question has been recently re - analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we just consider some examples to illustrate that , nevertheless , there exists now stringent constraints on the models .",
    "for instance , for the quadratic small field model , @xmath382 implies that @xmath383 which is problematic for this model . for the exponential model ,",
    "@xmath384 means that @xmath385 . in terms of the equation of state parameter , this means ( since one must have @xmath386 ) , @xmath387 during inflation .",
    "more importantly , the chaotic models are now severely constrained . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that there is a limit on @xmath339 which implies that @xmath388 ( for chaotic models ) .",
    "this means that the models @xmath389 , with @xmath390 are now under big pressure , as summarized in the right panel in fig .",
    "other important conclusions can be obtained ( in particular on the energy scale of inflation ) and we refer the reader to ref .",

    "despite its impressive successes , inflation has problems . for instance",
    ", it would be clearly desirable to embed slow - roll inflation into a realistic model of particle physics at high energies ( susy , sugra , string theory etc  ) .",
    "unfortunately , no obvious candidate has yet emerged ( for a complete discussion of the model building problem , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "yet another open issue is the so - called trans - planckian problem of inflation  @xcite .",
    "this is the fact that , at the beginning of inflation , the scales of astrophysical relevance today were smaller than the planck length , _ i.e. _ where in a regime where quantum field theory is expected to break down .",
    "since the standard calculation of the power spectrum is based on quantum field theory , this questions the validity of its derivation .",
    "it is not easy to predict to which modifications this could give rise since quantum gravity is not known .",
    "fortunately , one can show that `` reasonable '' modifications of high - energy physics can leave an imprint on the observables  @xcite like the cmbr multipole moments .",
    "therefore , there is a hope to constrain the new physics with ( future ) high accuracy cosmological observations .",
    "this would be a concrete realization of the idea that cosmology can help us to understand high energy physics .",
