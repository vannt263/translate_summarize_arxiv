    "thermal convection and shear are central to the study of hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the interest in these stems both from their large number of practical applications and also from their status as prototypes in theoretical investigation . in this study",
    ", we combine two well - known cylindrical configurations : rayleigh - bnard convection in which the upper and lower bounding disks of the cylinder are maintained at different temperatures , and von krmn flow in which the disks rotate at equal and opposite velocities .",
    "we choose the simplest small - aspect - ratio geometry : a cylinder with equal height and radius , with imposed axisymmetry .",
    "there is an extensive literature on rayleigh - bnard convection in a small to medium aspect - ratio cylinder ( in which the radius is between 0.5 and 5 times the height ) , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the references most relevant to us are axisymmetric simulations @xcite which produced patterns of radially travelling concentric rolls ( target patterns ) .",
    "these were shown to be produced in most cases by a saddle - node infinite period ( sniper ) bifurcation which will be the subject of much of the present investigation .",
    "the literature on von krmn flow is not as voluminous , but is growing . restricting ourselves to the",
    "small to medium aspect - ratio and the exactly or nearly exactly counter - rotating configuration , recent numerical articles include axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric simulations @xcite .",
    "interest in this problem has been enhanced by experiments using this configuration at high reynolds numbers to generate turbulence @xcite or a magnetic field via the dynamo effect @xcite .",
    "the combined rayleigh - bnard / von krmn configuration seems , however , unexplored .",
    "this situation stands in contrast to that of other shear and rotating flows .",
    "the superposition of plane poiseuille flow with rayleigh - bnard convection ( prb ) , has been the subject of a great many investigations ; indeed , a recent review @xcite cites hundreds of articles . for longitudinal rolls in plane",
    "poiseuille and couette flows , the threshold remains unchanged @xcite . for rolls transverse to the poiseuille flow , the threshold increases and its nature changes from absolute to convective , e.g.  @xcite . in taylor - couette flow between cylinders at different temperatures ,",
    "the nature of the instability also depends strongly on the angle between the imposed shear and buoyancy force , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "turning to rotating disks , heat transfer in the rotor - stator configuration ( between a rotating and a stationary disk ) is extensively studied because of its applications to turbomachinery , e.g. @xcite .",
    "rotating rayleigh - bnard convection has long interested geophysicists , as well as researchers in pattern formation e.g.  @xcite , because of the possibility of chaos at onset ; sniper bifurcations are found in this system as well @xcite .",
    "of the studies we have found of the flow between counter - rotating disks maintained at different temperatures , one computes the similarity solution between disks of infinite radius prior to the onset of convection @xcite , and another considers turbulent flows and neglects buoyancy @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh - bnard / von krmn problem in this geometry turns out to display a number of fascinating phenomena . for this reason ,",
    "this problem has been used to develop and test a reduced model for numerical simulation , in which fields are expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of the governing equations linearized about a steady state ; this study is the subject of a companion paper @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : problem ] presents the governing equations of our configuration , along with the non - dimensionalizations we have used . in section [ sec : methods ] , we describe the various codes we have used to carry out time - dependent simulations , branch continuation and linear stability analysis .",
    "section [ sec : thresholds ] shows how the transition threshold is affected by the disk counter - rotation . in sections [ sec : steady ] and [ sec : oscill ] , we present the steady states and limit cycles resulting from the transition . the connection between the steady states and limit cycle via a sniper bifurcation is explained in section [ sec : bifs ] , which presents a complete phase diagram and bifurcation analysis . reversing the traditional order , section [ sec : linear ] gives a linear stability analysis of the basic state , showing how the convective eigenvalues and eigenvectors are interlaced and joined by the von krmn flow .",
    "we consider a viscous newtonian fluid governed by the boussinesq approximation and contained in a cylinder of radius @xmath8 and height @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity and temperature fields are assumed axisymmetric .",
    "the bounding cylinder is stationary and thermally insulating .",
    "the upper and lower bounding disks are thermally conducting , rotate with angular velocities @xmath10 and @xmath11 and are held at temperatures @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the nondimensional parameters are defined as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the kinematic viscosity , the thermal diffusivity , the thermal expansion coefficient , and the gravitational acceleration , respectively .",
    "the prandtl number @xmath19 and aspect ratio @xmath20 are set to one .",
    "reynolds numbers in the range @xmath6 will be studied , along with rayleigh numbers in the range @xmath21 .",
    "our study uses several independent codes , summarized in section [ sec : methods ] , which use different non - dimensionalizations , and different problem formulations , i.e. primitive variables or streamfunction - vorticity . to facilitate later discussion , we briefly present these various formulations here .",
    "the non - dimensionalized temperature is taken to be the deviation from @xmath12 divided by @xmath22 and lengths are non - dimensionalized by @xmath8 .",
    "the imposed counter - rotation of the disks provides a natural timescale : if time is non - dimensionalized by @xmath23 and velocities by @xmath24 , the resulting governing equations are :    @xmath25    [ eq : goveqns ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the vector and scalar laplacian , respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions are :    @xmath28    [ eq : bcs ]    these equations can not be used in the absence of rotation , when @xmath3 . to allow for this case , the unit of time",
    "can instead be taken to be the viscous diffusion time @xmath29 , with the resulting velocity scale @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , with the assumption of axisymmetry , the meridional velocity components @xmath31 are best described by the stokes streamfunction @xmath32 :    [ eq : strmvort ] @xmath33 defining operators @xmath34 the azimuthal vorticity is : @xmath35    and the navier - stokes and boussinesq equations reduce to :    [ eq : eqstrm ] @xmath36    the rotation then appears in the boundary conditions , which become :    @xmath37    [ eq : bcstrm ]    the velocity and time in - are related to those in - by @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; the temperature @xmath40 and all lengths remain unchanged .",
    "equations ( [ eq : vtheta ] ) and ( [ eq : tmp ] ) can be considered to be advection - diffusion equations for the azimuthal velocity @xmath41 and the temperature @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) shows that gradients in @xmath41 and @xmath40 in turn generate vorticity .",
    "the vertical gradient @xmath42 , when combined with the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bcsz1])-([eq : bcsz0 ] ) , corresponds to ekman pumping , by which the @xmath43-dependent @xmath41 generates meridional vorticity and velocity for any non - zero @xmath1 .",
    "this meridional velocity in turn affects the azimuthal velocity and the temperature via equations and .",
    " however , the thermal gradient term @xmath44 in the vorticity equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) is radial , and so the axial temperature gradient imposed by boundary conditions in ( [ eq : bcsz1])-([eq : bcsz0 ] ) does not immediately impart motion to the fluid for any non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "that is , rayleigh - bnard convection occurs via an instability at a finite threshold @xmath45 , in contrast to natural convection , in which an externally imposed horizontal gradient generates motion for any @xmath46 via the term @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we state the symmetries of the configuration of our problem , which can be seen from figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the rayleigh - bnard convection problem has the symmetry of combined reflection in @xmath43 and in @xmath40 about their mean values , sometimes called the boussinesq symmetry .",
    "the von krmn flow has the symmetry of combined reflection in @xmath43 and in @xmath48 , called @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "( in this axisymmetric problem , reflection in @xmath48 means only reversing the sign of @xmath50 ; since all solutions are invariant under rotations in @xmath48 , these are not considered . )",
    "the rayleigh - bnard / von krmn problem thus has the symmetry which combines reflection in @xmath43 , @xmath48 and @xmath40 .",
    "a state is reflection - symmetric if it is invariant under the reflection operator defined in the two formulations by : @xmath51",
    "we have solved the governing equations using a number of different codes .",
    "the first is the time - integration code written by patankar @xcite for equations .",
    "the temporal discretization uses the backwards differentiation formula for the time derivative , the explicit adams - bashforth formula for the advective and buoyancy terms , and implicit evaluation of the diffusive terms , which leads to the following form for timestepping equation : @xmath52 \\nonumber\\\\ + 2 \\left(\\begin{array}{c}({{\\bf u}}\\cdot{\\nabla}){{\\bf u}}\\\\{{\\bf u}}\\cdot{\\nabla}t\\end{array}\\right)^{t } -\\left(\\begin{array}{c}({{\\bf u}}\\cdot{\\nabla}){{\\bf u}}\\\\{{\\bf u}}\\cdot{\\nabla}t\\end{array}\\right)^{t-{\\delta t}}\\nonumber\\\\ = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{re } { \\delta}{{\\bf u}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{pr re } { \\nabla^2}t \\end{array}\\right)^{t+{\\delta t } }   -\\left(\\begin{array}{c}{\\nabla}p \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)^{t+{\\delta t } } \\nonumber\\\\ + 2 \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{ra}{pr re^2 } t{{\\bf e}}_z\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)^{t } -\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{ra}{pr re^2 } t{{\\bf e}}_z\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)^{t-{\\delta t } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spatial discretization uses centered finite differences .",
    "a staggered grid is used , with pressure and temperature represented on the nodes and the velocity components between the nodes . a timestep @xmath53 and a resolution in the radial and axial direction of @xmath54 were used .",
    "time integration has also been carried out with a second code , which uses the streamfunction - vorticity formulation  , a second - order finite difference scheme in space , and an alternating - direction - implicit scheme in time @xcite .",
    "a @xmath55 grid with a typical timestep of @xmath56 were found to be adequate for obtaining converged results .",
    "we also carried out bifurcation and linear stability analysis .",
    "we followed branches via newton s method and calculated eigenvalues via arpack .",
    "several different spatial representations have been used .",
    "one code uses the same spatial discretization ",
    "i.e. the streamfunction - vorticity formulation and the same spatial resolution  as the time - integration code mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "the jacobian of the matrix built in the last step of newton iteration is directly used in arpack in shift - invert mode .",
    "the branches are followed using an arclength continuation as described in @xcite and the practical implementation of bordered matrix inversion can be found in @xcite .",
    "the second code @xcite with which we carried out bifurcation and linear stability analysis uses the primitive variable formulation and a pseudo - spectral spatial discretization .",
    "the number of chebyshev polynomials ( or gauss - lobatto collocation points ) used is 15 in each of the @xmath57 and @xmath43 directions .",
    "the quantitative results which we present have been obtained by two or more of the codes described above , and have also been verified by varying the resolution .",
    "in the absence of rotation , i.e.  @xmath3 , the governing equations have as a solution the conductive state , in which the fluid is stationary and the temperature varies linearly in the vertical direction : @xmath58 although the conductive solution exists for all @xmath0 , it loses stability at some critical value @xmath45 to a convective solution , in which fluid motion ensues , breaking the boussinesq reflection symmetry . in the von krmn system , as mentioned in section [ sec : problem ] , ekman pumping leads to recirculating regions for any non - zero value of @xmath1 .",
    "however , for a fixed value of @xmath1 , there is still a transition at a well - defined @xmath45 , at which one solution loses stability to another . by analogy with the non - rotating case",
    ", we will call these the _ basic _ and _ convective _ solutions , despite the presence of fluid motion ( and thus of convective heat transfer ) for @xmath59 , and we will continue to refer to the transition between them as the onset of convection .",
    "we begin by showing the critical rayleigh number for onset of axisymmetric convection as a function of reynolds number . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the bifurcation is to a steady state ( i.e.  the critical eigenvalue is real ) , and for @xmath61 , the bifurcation is to an oscillatory state ( i.e.  the critical eigenvalue is complex ) .",
    "the thresholds in figure [ fig : thresholds ] are obtained by calculating the eigenvalues of the linearized problem for fixed values of @xmath62 and interpolating to find the value @xmath63 at which the eigenvalue or its real part crosses zero .",
    "thresholds were also obtained independently by fitting decay rates from the time - stepping code to exponentials and extrapolating these to zero .    away from where the bifurcation changes its nature from steady to oscillatory",
    ", @xmath45 should be a smooth function of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 must be an even function of @xmath1 , since reversing @xmath1 means reversing the direction of rotation of the upper and lower disks , an operation which leaves all dynamical properties unchanged , as was argued @xcite in the context of rayleigh - bnard convection with throughflow .",
    "we fit @xmath45 over the range of the steady bifurcation , @xmath64 , to an even polynomial , obtaining : @xmath65 we see that the von krmn flow stabilizes the system against thermal convection .",
    "we contrast this with results from other mixed thermal / shear systems . in plane",
    "poiseuille and couette flow , the threshold for onset of longitudinal rolls is unaffected by the shear @xcite .",
    "( in our system , the rolls can be seen as longitudinal , since the axes of concentric rolls are azimuthal , as is the velocity of the bounding disks . ) in taylor - couette flow ( measured by the taylor number @xmath66 ) with a radial temperature gradient ( measured by the grashof number @xmath67 ) , the role of rotation and heating are reversed from our system .",
    "any radial temperature gradient causes large - scale motion ( a role played by @xmath1 in our system ) and a bifurcation to taylor vortices is seen at a finite rotation rate ( a role played by @xmath0 in our system ) . in experiments on this system @xcite , @xmath68 decreases with @xmath67 , in contrast to the increase in @xmath45 with @xmath1 in our case .",
    "the threshold value @xmath69 agrees well with those previously reported for the onset of convection for insulating sidewalls and aspect ratio @xmath70 , notably 2260 @xcite , 2300 ( @xmath71=1.8% ) @xcite , 2241 ( @xmath71= 0.8% ) @xcite , and 2250 ( @xmath71= 0.4% ) @xcite .",
    "these authors all found the most unstable mode to be axisymmetric for cylindrical convection at this aspect ratio .",
    "varying @xmath1 and investigating the thresholds of non - axisymmetric eigenmodes shows that the critical azimuthal wavenumber is @xmath72 for @xmath73 . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the primary axisymmetric convective branch becomes unstable to an @xmath72 perturbation near @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "for the pure von krmn flow , i.e. with @xmath0 set to zero and @xmath1 gradually increased from zero , the first instability occurs near @xmath75 to an @xmath72 mode @xcite .",
    "we nonetheless restrict our consideration here to the axisymmetric bifurcations and eigenmodes .",
    "there are a number of reasons for doing so .",
    "first , an understanding of the axisymmetric problem is important for completeness : branches which are unstable may nonetheless play a role in the dynamics . secondly , the axisymmetric problem displays a number of fascinating phenomena , both linear and nonlinear , as we will see . because of this , it has served as a test case for a numerical method using a reduced model @xcite ; a presentation of the results from fully resolved computations is a necessary complement to this study . finally , additional physical effects , e.g.  magnetic fields , can stabilize the axisymmetric configuration @xcite .",

    "the azimuthal velocity increases gradually from negative in the lower half to positive in the upper half of the cylinder , following the counter - rotating disks .",
    "it is singular at the corners @xmath92 , @xmath93 since the boundary conditions are discontinuous where the stationary cylinder meets the rotating disks .",
    "the large recirculating cells caused by ekman pumping are prominent features in the @xmath94 plane , carrying fluid radially outward along both rotating disks at @xmath93 , then along the bounding cylinder , inwards along the midplane @xmath95 , and back towards the two disks along the axis . the azimuthal velocity and recirculating cells combine to yield fluid trajectories which are toroidal .",
    "we may compare the basic flows in figures [ fig : conductive_re40 ] and [ fig : conductive_re90 ] .",
    "for @xmath91 , the temperature field is noticeably different from the linear conductive profile .",
    "the recirculating cells are stronger , with a maximal velocity of @xmath96 , as compared to @xmath97 for @xmath90 .",
    "these stronger recirculating cells exert more influence on the temperature field . at @xmath92 ,",
    "the isotherms are deviated towards the midplane as warm fluid converges upwards from the lower disk and cold fluid downwards from the upper disk . at @xmath98 ,",
    "the isotherms are deviated again , here outwards towards the upper and lower disks .",
    "the azimuthal velocity gradients for @xmath91 are more concentrated near the disks .",
    "the basic states shown in figures [ fig : conductive_re40 ] and [ fig : conductive_re90 ] are reflection - symmetric about the midplane : each is invariant under @xmath99 , as defined in .",
    "the transition to convection breaks the reflection symmetry . in the absence of rotation ,",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath100 , as stated in section [ sec : thresholds ] , and leads to a single roll which occupies the entire cavity . for @xmath90",
    ", transition occurs at @xmath101 and the resulting convective state , shown in figure [ fig : convective_re40 ] for @xmath84 , has one small roll ( due to the weak von krmn flow ) in the upper right corner in addition to the main large convection roll . for @xmath91 , the onset of convection occurs at @xmath102 and the resulting convective state is shown in figure [ fig : convective_re90 ] at @xmath103 .",
    "the influence of the counter - rotating disks is stronger than it is at @xmath90 and so the recirculating rolls , resulting from the combined effects of ekman pumping ( which favors two equal rolls ) and convection ( which favors a single roll ) , are more equal in size .",
    "the consequences on @xmath50 and @xmath40 of these changes in @xmath32 can also clearly be seen in figures [ fig : convective_re40 ] and [ fig : convective_re90 ] .",
    "( these in turn affect @xmath32 via the buoyancy and ekman pumping effects , though to a lesser extent . )",
    "although the smaller cell in figures [ fig : convective_re40 ] and [ fig : convective_re90 ] is in the upper corner of the cylinder , the pitchfork bifurcation can produce a small cell at either the upper or lower corner .",
    "the breaking of reflection symmetry is also manifested by the azimuthal velocity : the @xmath104 contour intersects the axis near @xmath105 in both figures [ fig : convective_re40 ] and [ fig : convective_re90 ] , in contrast to the basic flow , for which this contour is a straight line across the midplane at @xmath106 .",
    "for @xmath107 , the transition from the basic state is a hopf bifurcation , creating oscillatory flows .",
    "we fix @xmath108 and present two oscillatory states , or limit cycles , one at @xmath109 in figure [ fig : re110_visu ] and one at @xmath110 in figure [ fig : re63_visu ] .",
    "( although for @xmath110 , the first bifurcation as @xmath0 is increased is to steady convection , there is another bifurcation at higher @xmath0 to oscillatory convection and the resulting limit cycles are stable and connected to those created by the hopf bifurcation for @xmath107 , as we will see in section [ sec : bifs ] . )",
    "we call the limit cycles at @xmath109 and @xmath110 near - sinusoidal and near - heteroclinic , respectively , which we will also explain in section [ sec : bifs ] .",

    "the vortices are somewhat similar in size , with the vortex in the upper or lower outer corner alternatively becoming smaller and larger . at re=63 ( figure [ fig : re63_visu ] ) ,",
    "the principle vortex remains much larger throughout the limit cycle , with much smaller vortices on the periphery . at @xmath111",
    ", there appear to be two vortices which both extend over the entire height , suggesting an interpretation of this limit cycle as a competition between one and two concentric radial vortices .",
    "this interpretation will be discussed further in section [ sec : linear ] .",
    "section [ sec : steady ] showed that the transition to steady convection breaks the reflection symmetry , creating two asymmetric states related by the reflection operator @xmath99 .",
    "the transition to oscillatory convection has an analogous property : each of the instantaneous states shown in figures [ fig : re110_visu ] and [ fig : re63_visu ] is asymmetric , and the second half of each limit cycle is related to the first half by reflection , i.e. : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the oscillation period .    to better understand the limit cycles in figures [ fig : re110_visu ] and [ fig : re63_visu ] , we plot various scalar quantities  @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116  as a function of time and of each other to create the timeseries and phase portraits of figure [ fig : timeseries ] .",
