    "photonic crystals and in particular photonic band gap ( pbg ) materials@xcite have recently attracted much attention@xcite due to their rich physics and possible applications . in these systems the dielectric function is periodically modulated and , as a result , their optical properties are dominated by light diffraction effects . when bragg diffraction conditions are met then light scattering",
    "is very strong , so that within certain frequency intervals near the resonances light propagation is inhibited .",
    "since the subject of photonic crystals was introduced,@xcite one of the main goals of photonic band - structure calculations was to engineer structures with a _ complete _ band gap , _",
    "i.e. _ with no propagating solutions of maxwell s equations within a certain _ forbidden gap_. the pursuit of this goal has generated a stream of studies that are too numerous to be cited here ; early works are reviewed in refs .. here we only mention that a complete band gap in two dimensions ( 2d ) was theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally demonstrated@xcite for an array of dielectric rods . in the quest for a structure having a complete pbg in three dimensions ( 3d ) , the diamond lattice was shown@xcite to be more promising than a simple face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice@xcite .",
    "the frequency gap in the photonic spectrum sets a stage for a number of physical effects . the prime effect",
    ", namely the inhibition of spontaneous emission for an emitter with transition frequency within the gap , was already suggested in the pioneering works.@xcite furthermore , since light can not leave the emitting atom , a coupled atom - field in - gap state is formed , in which the atomic level is `` dressed '' by its own exponentially localized radiation field.@xcite it was also demonstrated that although a single photon can not propagate inside the gap , nevertheless a non - linear medium embedded inside the photonic crystal gives rise to multi - photon bound states@xcite , or gap solitons@xcite that result in self - induced transparency .",
    "yet another consequence of pbg is the modification of cooperative emission with frequency close to the band edge .",
    "in particular pbg was shown to change the rate of superradiant emission from an ensemble of emitters.@xcite",
    "lastly , pbg structures facilitate strong anderson localization of photons@xcite because the sharp density of states within the gap spectral range necessitates a reinterpretation of the ioffe - regel criterion.@xcite    pbg structures with a defect constitute a separate area of study initiated by the classical works in refs .. these structures are important since the defects cause localized intragap states . for these states , the pbg sample acts as a resonator with a very high quality factor .",
    "this property was recently used for designing a low - threshold pbg defect - mode laser.@xcite    another class of materials with a forbidden gap for light propagation are spatially homogeneous , but frequency - dispersive media .",
    "the energy gap in these systems has a polaritonic origin , _ i.e. _ it is formed due to the interaction of light with the medium polarization.@xcite this energy gap can be viewed as the result of anticrossing between the photonic and excitonic dispersion relation branches .",
    "some non - trivial manifestations of the polaritonic gap were recently explored in refs .. in these papers a general model of two - level systems interacting with elementary electromagnetic excitations with a gap in the spectrum was solved by means of the bethe ansatz technique . within this model a very rich excitation spectrum was found,@xcite consisting of ordinary solitons , single - particle impurity bound states and massive pairs of confined gap excitations and their bound complexes  dissipationless quantum gap solitons .",
    "most of the available photonic crystals nowadays however have _ incomplete _ pbgs ; this means that light propagation is forbidden only along certain directions inside the crystal .",
    "a prominent example are opals , representing self - assembled monodispersed silica balls@xcite arranged in a fcc type lattice . although opals have only incomplete pbg , the voids between the balls can be infiltrated by various media , which brings about non - trivial physics .",
    "in particular , the medium may contain polarizable molecules .",
    "infiltrated opal with polarizable molecules combines therefore polaritonic and bragg - diffractive properties .",
    "obviously , both effects coexist independently when the bragg ( @xmath0 ) and polaritonic ( @xmath1 ) resonances are well separated in frequency .",
    "a completely different situation occurs when @xmath2 .",
    "this may be easily achieved in infiltrated opals that gives rise to a peculiar _ interplay _ between various frequency dispersions .",
    "this interplay is the subject of the present paper .",
    "our most important finding pertains to the case when the polaritonic gap of the polarized molecules infiltrating the opal lies within the opal pbg .",
    "we demonstrate that such an overlap gives rise to novel massive _ propagating _ excitations having frequencies inside the bragg gap , that we dubbed here _",
    "braggoritons_. in other words , the bragg gap _ splits _ into two sub - gaps , so that the braggoritonic branches are isolated from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "we found that the braggoriton dispersion relation is very sensitive to the frequency detuning between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and to the relative width of the polaritonic gap ( or , alternatively rabi frequency ) and the bragg gap .",
    "the principal assumption we adopt here is that the bragg gap , @xmath5 , is narrow compared to @xmath3 ; this is actually the case in opals .",
    "the small value of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) enables us then to obtain analytical results .",
    "in addition we also study the phase slip related intragap defect states for @xmath2 . in the absence of polaritonic effect , the underlying physics of the defect - induced intragap states was already discussed in the original pbg paper@xcite .",
    "an analogy was drawn between a defect state and a localized mode in a distributed feedback resonator , that originates from a phase slip .",
    "we extend this picture to incorporate polarizable medium and show that when the bragg gap splits into two sub - gaps , then an existing phase slip gives rise to _ two _ localized states with frequencies within _ each _ of the sub - gaps .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in order to introduce the notations , we separately review in sec .  ii the derivation of the pbg and polaritonic spectra using the second quantization representation . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the combined hamiltonian in the second quantization representation and diagonalize it by a unitary transformation .",
    "this yields the dispersion relations for the two excitations outside the gap , or bloch - like waves , and the two intragap branches , or braggoritons .",
    "the properties of these novel excitations are analyzed in sec .",
    "we use them in sec .",
    "v to determine the intragap frequencies of the defect - induced localized states .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian  of the system under study is the sum of three terms    @xmath8    the first term , @xmath9 , describes the photons in a photonic crystal .",
    "the second term , @xmath10 , is the hamiltonian of the polarizable medium ; @xmath11 describes the photon - medium coupling . in this section",
    "we review two limiting cases : ( _ i _ ) no polarizable medium ( @xmath12 ) , and ( _ ii _ ) no modulation of the dielectric constant .",

    "modulation of @xmath19 causes light diffraction , so that the plane wave solutions are no longer the correct eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian  ( [ hem ] ) .",
    "below we consider a photonic crystal with an incomplete pbg along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "this situation can be approximated by a one - dimensional modulation of @xmath19 along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "if the bragg gap is relatively narrow as assumed above , then it may be sufficient to consider only the first harmonics in @xmath21 : @xmath22 here @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the modulation amplitude , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the modulation period and @xmath27 is the dielectric modulation phase .",

    "light polarization is irrelevant .",
    "generalization to arbitrary propagation direction is straightforward .",

    "correspondingly , the transmission coefficient within these frequency regions must be low if the sample is sufficiently thick .",
