    "a useful question to ask when one studies quantum fields in general relativity is the following : given that all matter is inherently quantum in nature , will quantum effects remove the singularity at the centre of a black hole spacetime ? to answer this question using a scalar field and semi - classical perturbation theory , one must first calculate the expectation value @xmath1  where @xmath2 is the stress - energy tensor operator of the scalar field @xmath3 . in this paper @xmath0  is computed in preparation for the computation of @xmath1  which is used as the source term for the einstein field equations :    @xmath4    a review of handling quantum fields in the presence of strong gravitational fields can been found in articles by wipf  @xcite and dewitt  @xcite and in books by birrel and davies  @xcite and wald  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0  for massless fields has been computed for both the interior and exterior of a schwarzschild black hole  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "these calculations have also been extended by anderson to accommodate massive fields in general spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat spacetimes  @xcite . a method has also been developed by anderson , hiscock and samuel  @xcite  @xcite to calculate the expectation value of the stress - energy operator , @xmath1  in spherically symmetric , static spacetimes .",
    "they use this method to calculate @xmath1  in schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm geometries .",
    "@xmath1  has also previously been computed by howard and candelas  @xcite in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the kerr spacetime has also been studied with fields propagating in this geometry .",
    "frolov  @xcite has calculated @xmath0  for massless fields on the event horizon pole of a kerr - newmann black hole as well as deriving an approximate expression for @xmath1  near the horizon with thorne  @xcite .",
    "massive fields in the exterior geometry have been studied by frolov and zelnikov  @xcite .",
    "various works on back reaction effects of quantum fields on black hole geometries have been produced .",
    "for schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm spacetimes this includes the work of hiscock and weems  @xcite , bardeen and balbinot  @xcite  @xcite , and york  @xcite who used page s analytic approximation  @xcite for @xmath1  in einstein spacetimes for conformally invariant fields .",
    "more recently hiscock and larson  @xcite have extended their analysis to the schwarzschild interior and calculated back reaction effects on curvature invariants .",
    "most work in this field has been done in the context of spherical or oblate symmetry .",
    "we wish to extend the analysis to other symmetries and ultimately ask if the above results are general or are specific to the particular symmetry chosen .",
    "for example , does the presence of the quantum field have the same effect on the curvature growth and on the anisotropy of a black hole interior for all symmetries ? if curvature invariants are weakened for all systems studied then one can say with some confidence that quantum effects may remove the singularity .",
    "the system studied here will be that of a massless klein - gordon field with conformal curvature coupling propagating in the spacetime generated by a straight black string .",
    "this background is chosen for several reasons .",
    "first , it possesses cylindrical ( as opposed to spherical ) symmetry and secondly , in the context of cosmic strings it represents a system which may physically exist in the universe .",
    "it could also be argued that sufficiently close to a black string loop the spacetime will possess this type of geometry .",
    "there has also been a revived interest in anti - desitter spacetimes in the context of conformal field theories .",
    "the metric chosen is that developed by kaloper  @xcite and lemos and zanchin  @xcite which admits a line element of the following form : @xmath5d\\varphi^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{d\\rho^2}{\\alpha^2\\rho^2- \\frac{2(3\\omega - m)}{\\alpha\\rho}+\\frac{(3\\omega - m)4q^{2 } } { ( \\omega+m)\\alpha^2\\rho^2 } } + \\alpha^2\\rho^2\\ ; dz^2 \\label{eq : genmetric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the mass , charge , and angular momentum per unit length of the string respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is given by : @xmath10 the constant @xmath11 is defined as follows : @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the cosmological constant , negative giving the spacetime its asymptotically anti - desitter behaviour .",
    "the spacetime has a well defined time - like killing vector field with respect to which modes can be defined .    much interesting",
    "work has been done regarding effects of quantum fields in the 3d btz  @xcite black hole  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the system here however does not dimensionally reduce to the 3d btz black hole whose four dimensional counterpart ( without charge or angular momentum ) is given for reference as  @xcite @xmath14 this is due to the fact that the dilaton field is non zero and non constant in the corresponding three dimensional action .    in the spacetime considered here ,",
    "both charge and angular momentum are zero yielding the following for ( [ eq : genmetric ] ) @xmath15 it can immediately be seen from ( [ eq : metric ] ) that the spacetime behaves as anti - desitter as @xmath16 and therefore the spacetime is not globally hyperbolic .",
    "this fact requires boundary conditions to be imposed to control the flow of information in and out of the time - like infinity .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that three natural boundary conditions arise in ads@xmath17 spacetime and the condition used here is that of a `` transparent '' boundary condition .",
    "in this section a euclidean space approach is used to calculate the green function .",
    "the calculation is similar to that done by anderson  @xcite who calculated @xmath0  in a reissner - nordstrm spacetime however , the method is extended here to a system which is neither spherically symmetric nor asymptotically flat .",
    "the euclidean space method amounts to making the transformation @xmath18 in metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath0   is then defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the euclidean space green function satisfying the equation @xmath21g_{e}(x , x')= \\frac{-\\delta^{4}(x , x')}{\\sqrt{g(x)}}. \\label{eq : kg}\\ ] ] the mass term in the klein - gordon operator will be set to zero in order to comply with the transparent boundary conditions mentioned earlier .",
    "the presence of three killing fields allows the right - hand - side of the above equation to be expanded in terms of cylindrical functions as follows : @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the temperature of the field . the green function",
    "can similarly be expanded giving @xmath25 the function @xmath26 must satisfy the following equation @xmath27=\\frac{-\\delta(\\rho,\\rho')}{\\rho^2\\alpha}. \\label{eq : evolve}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a solution is assumed of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the lesser and greater of @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . integrating across the @xmath33 function gives the wronskian normalisation condition : @xmath34 = \\frac{-1}{\\alpha\\rho^{2}(\\alpha^2\\rho^2-\\frac{4m}{\\alpha^2\\rho^2})}. \\label{eq : wronsk}\\ ] ]    the asymptotic behaviour of the solution can be found by studying the solutions to ( [ eq : evolve ] ) in the appropriate regimes . for @xmath35",
    "the solution has the form : @xmath36 whereas near the horizon @xmath37 solutions are found to behave as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "it can easily be seen that @xmath40 diverges at infinity and @xmath41 is divergent at the horizon . the general solution with the correct asymptotic behaviour",
    "can be found by ansatz .",
    "such a solution takes the form @xmath42 @xmath43 is a function of @xmath31 which evolves according to the equation : @xmath44 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{36m^2}{\\alpha^6\\rho^6 } + \\frac{\\xi r}{\\alpha^2}\\left(1-\\frac{4m}{\\alpha^3\\rho^3}\\right ) + \\frac{x'}{x}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\rho+\\frac{2m}{\\alpha^3\\rho^2 } -\\frac{16m^2}{\\alpha^6\\rho^5}\\right ] \\label{eq : x } \\\\ \\label{eq : xevolve } & + & \\left(\\frac{x'}{x}\\right)^{2}\\left[-\\frac{3}{4}\\rho^2 + \\frac{6m}{\\alpha^3\\rho}-\\frac{12m^2}{\\alpha^6\\rho^4}\\right ] + \\frac{x''}{x}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\rho^2-\\frac{4m}{\\alpha^3\\rho}+ \\frac{8m^2}{\\alpha^6\\rho^4}\\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be obtained by substituting ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) into ( [ eq : kg ] ) . substituting ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) into ( [ eq : wronsk ] ) gives @xmath45 for all mode functions .",
    "a point splitting algorithm developed by christensen  @xcite will be used to renormalise the field . in this technique",
    ", one chooses the points @xmath46 and @xmath47 to be nearby points in the spacetime before the full coincidence limit is taken .",
    "it is convenient to have the points take on equal values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 so that the coordinate separation is given by @xmath50 .",
    "the unrenormalised green function now takes on the form : @xmath51 it should be noted at this point that there exists a superficial ultra - violet divergence over @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the above expression .",
    "this divergence can most easily be eliminated using a similar technique as candelas  @xcite and anderson  @xcite . it is noted that as long as @xmath54 any multiple of @xmath55 can be added to ( [ eq : unreng ] ) .",
    "substituting @xmath43 from ( [ eq : x ] ) in the large @xmath52 and @xmath53 limit and subtracting this term from ( [ eq : unreng ] ) the logarithmic divergences can be eliminated giving the following expression : @xmath56      to calculate the renormalised value of @xmath0  a point splitting technique will be used .",
    "the dewitt generalisation to schwinger s expansion is used as an approximation for the green function .",
    "this term will then be subtracted from ( [ eq : finiteg ] ) and the @xmath57 limit will be taken along the shortest geodesic separating the points .",
    "the dewitt - schwinger counter - term is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the `` world function '' of synge  @xcite which is equal to half of the square of the geodesic distance between two points .",
    "the points in this case will be @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it can be shown , by geodesic expansion ( see appendix a ) , that the world function in the spacetime considered here takes on the form @xmath62 using these expressions the dewitt - schwinger counter term is equal to @xmath63    the first term in ( [ eq : moreds ] ) can be rewritten in a more convenient way by using the plana sum formula  @xcite as used by anderson .",
    "the formula is @xmath64}{e^{2\\pi t}-1}.\\ ] ] with this , the first expression in the counter term can be written as @xmath65 which gives , for the entire counter - term in the @xmath66 limit : @xmath67 it can be shown that the second and third terms in ( [ eq : fullcounter ] ) , which normally diverge at the horizon , will cancel each other out on the horizon when @xmath24 is equal to the black hole temperature .",
    "that is , when @xmath68 therefore , the renormalised expression for @xmath0  in the hartle - hawking vacuum state is @xmath69 where , for convenience , the following notation has been used @xmath70",
    "in this section the value of @xmath0  will be calculated from (  [ eq : phisq ] ) .",
    "the solution is found by iteratively solving for the function @xmath43 using ( [ eq : xevolve ] ) in the mode functions with the lowest order term defined as : @xmath71 + \\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{36m^2}{\\alpha^6\\rho^6}+\\frac{\\xi r}{\\alpha^2}h,\\ ] ] and @xmath72 given by @xmath73 with this choice , the lowest order term will be valid at both the horizon and as @xmath31 approaches infinity .",
    "this can also be verified by comparison with ( [ eq : infbehav ] ) and ( [ eq : horizbehav ] ) .",
    "it is most convenient to do the integration over @xmath53 first followed by the sum over @xmath52 and finally , the sum over @xmath74 .",
    "this scheme leads to analytic solutions to both the integrals and the @xmath52 sums .    in the solution ,",
    "the sums and integrals have the following form : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a function of @xmath31 only .",
    "such integrals are known and are given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a fractional constant which depends on the particular value of the integer @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting sums over @xmath52 can now be done analytically by the standard contour integration : @xmath80 this is valid as the denominator never becomes singular at integer values of @xmath52 .    in the expansion of @xmath0",
    "there appears a term of the form @xmath81 which arises when the lowest order term is combined with the counterterm in ( [ eq : finiteg ] ) and integrated over @xmath53 .",
    "this is the only term which is singular at @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath82 term is therefore removed from the sum and redefined as to remove a spurious divergence of the form @xmath83 which is present in the same term once the sum from @xmath84 to @xmath85 has been calculated ( how this term arises is shown in more detail in appendix b. ) this redefinition can be performed since the counterterm introduced in (  [ eq : finiteg ] ) may be any quantity and the particular value shown there is exact only in the large @xmath52 limit .    the final sum over @xmath74 can now numerically be shown to converge by computing the values of @xmath0  for large @xmath74 .",
    "it can also be shown that the @xmath86 mode makes no contribution to the sum .",
    "the boundary values of the modes must be evaluated before numerical integration of the mode equation can be done .",
    "the value of the mode functions at infinity can easily be seen by studying the mode equation in the asymptotic region and therefore only the value at the horizon is left to be determined . at the horizon , there are many quantities in the expansion of @xmath0  which are inversely proportional to some power of the metric function @xmath87 . by performing an expansion of @xmath0  in the quantity @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the horizon value of @xmath31 , one can show ( although the procedure is lengthy ) that all terms with @xmath33 raised to some power in the denominator cancel at the horizon . in appendix",
    "b it is also demonstrated how terms which normally make a dominant contribution to @xmath0  cancel here .",
    "it should be noted that the horizon value is directly proportional to the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spacetime is an einstein spacetime with @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath0  was computed for the conformally coupled , massless case and the result is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it can be seen the the maximum value of @xmath0  occurs near , but not at , the horizon .",
    "this behaviour is analogous to the extreme reissner - nordstrm case @xcite .",
    "this is because , as shown in the appendix and earlier , most contributions to @xmath0  at the horizon vanish .",
    "however , near ( but not on ) the horizon terms with a @xmath91 behaviour make a large contribution . for large @xmath31 most terms in the field expansion vanish and therefore @xmath0  approaches a value which is dominated by the last two terms in ( [ eq : phisq ] ) .",

    "this expression has the same functional form as that of the world function for a static , spherically symmetric spacetime  @xcite if the coordinate separation there is also chosen as ( [ eq : xidef ] ) .",
