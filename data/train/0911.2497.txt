    "small - angle scattering ( sas ; x - rays , light , neutrons )  @xcite is one of the most important investigation techniques for the structural properties of fractal systems  @xcite at the nanometer scale .",
    "this technique yields the fourier transform of the spatial density distribution of a studied system within a wave vector range from @xmath0 to @xmath1@xmath2 and is thus very effective for object sizes from @xmath3 to @xmath4  @xcite . since",
    "only a finite range in wave vector space is available experimentally , the interpretation of the results requires theoretical models .    in the case of non - deterministic ( random ) fractals ,",
    "different models for mass and surface fractals @xcite have been successfully developed and applied to a variety of materials  @xcite .",
    "however , for deterministic fractals , only a few attempts have been made made  @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the technological limitations encountered until just a few years ago in the preparation of fractal - like structures .",
    "modern experimental techniques for obtaining deterministic fractal systems have now been developed @xcite .",
    "small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) from self - assembled porous silica materials @xcite was carried out by yamaguchi _",
    "( 2006 )  @xcite . a molecular sierpinski hexagonal gasket , the deterministic fractal polymer ,",
    "was also obtained by chemical methods @xcite .",
    "the main indicator of fractal structure is the power law behaviour of the scattering curve @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the power law scattering exponent .",
    "@xmath7 is the diffracted intensity and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scattering angle and @xmath10 is the incident wavelength .",
    "the expnent @xmath6 carries information regarding the fractal dimension of the scatterer @xcite : @xmath11 for mass fractals and @xmath12 for surface fractals .",
    "one can write down an even more general expression @xcite for the exponent in a two - phase geometric configuration , where one phase is a mass fractal of fractal dimension @xmath13 containing pores of fractal dimension @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the boundary surface between the phases also forms a fractal of dimension @xmath15 .",
    "the exponent then reads @xmath16 . in the particular case of a mass fractal",
    ", we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 , while for a surface fractal @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the construction of non - random fractal models assumes the presence of an initial set ( initiator ) and a generator ( iterative operation ) .",
    "usually , an initiator is divided into subparts .",
    "some of them are then removed according to an iterative rule and the process is repeated for each remaining part .",
    "in contrast with the simple power law behaviour above [ equation  ( [ scattexp ] ) ] , the scattering from non - random fractals , such as the menger sponge , fractal jack  @xcite or other surface - like type  @xcite , shows a successive superposition of maxima and minima decaying as a power law , which can be called a generalized power law .",
    "this is due to spatial order in non - random fractals : the scattering curve @xmath21 , being the fourier transform of the pair distribution function , oscillates by reason of singularities in this function or its derivatives .",
    "if there is disorder in the system then the singularities are smeared out , as in the case of random fractals , the behaviour of which follows the power law of equation ( [ scattexp ] ) . on the other hand , real physical systems always exhibit a specific kind of disorder , polydispersity .",
    "below , we show that when the polydispersity of non - random fractals is taken into account , these local oscillations cancel out with increasing width of the distribution function .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained for a similar fractal , the menger sponge , by averaging over a schulz distribution function @xcite .",
    "the existing models @xcite assume a given fractal dimension , which imposes some restrictions on applying the models to real systems . in this paper , a generalization of cantor sets",
    "is considered that allows us to control the fractal dimension using a scaling factor .",
    "the scattering intensity of randomly oriented generalized cantor sets is obtained analytically for mono- and polydisperse systems .",
    "our method is based on the approach that was successfully employed in some aspects for other similar systems of non - random fractals such as the menger sponge @xcite .",
    "numerous examples of the fractal - like behaviour were obtained experimentally in collaboration with one of the authors of this paper ( aik ) for different kind of objects , namely soils @xcite , biological objects @xcite and nanocomposites @xcite .",
    "only three parameters are extracted from the fractal scattering intensity : its exponent @xmath6 [ see equation  ( [ scattexp ] ) ] , and the edges of the fractal region in @xmath22-space , which appear as `` knees '' in the scattering line on a logarithmic scale . other parameters are not usually obtained from small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) curves .    if some features of the fractal structure are available from other considerations , one can construct a model and obtain additional information on the fractal parameters . note that a real physical system does not possess an infinite scaling effect and the number of iterations is always finite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the scattering from generalized cantor sets for a finite number of iterations .",
    "as discussed below , many features of the scattering are quite general ; in particular , one can estimate the number of particles from which the fractal is formed .",
    "the well known cantor set is created by repeatedly deleting the open central third of a set of line segments .",
    "one can construct various generalizations of the set by , say , cutting the segments into a different number of intervals or choosing another scaling factor ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "below , we explicitly describe a three - dimensional generalization of the cantor set , which is used for studying the scattering in the subsequent sections .    the generalized cantor set in three dimensions can be constructed from a homogeneous cube by iterations , which we will call approximants .",
    "the zero - order iteration ( initiator ) is the cube itself with side length @xmath23 , which can be specified in cartesian coordinates as a set of points obeying the conditions @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the first iteration removes all points from the cube with coordinates @xmath27 or @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "the dimensionless scaling factor @xmath30 can take any value between zero and three .",
    "thus , the initial cube is divided into 27 parts , the eight cubes are left in the corners , with edge length @xmath31 , and the 19 parallelepipeds are removed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dcantorset ] , upper panel ) .",
    "+     in order to obtain the second approximant , one should do the same with each of the eight cubes , thus leaving 64 cubes of side length @xmath32 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the @xmath33th approximant to the three - dimensional cantor set is composed of @xmath34 cubes of the side length @xmath35 the generalized cantor set is obtained in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "the hausdorff dimension  @xcite of the set can be determined from the intuitively apparent relation @xmath37 for a large number of iterations , which yields @xmath38 where the scaling factor @xmath39 for each iteration is defined as @xmath40 in the same manner , it can be shown that the fractal dimension of the surface coincides with that of the bulk structure .",
    "we then have a mass fractal , the dimension of which can be varied between zero and three by changing the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "note that the generalized cantor set composed of cubes is simply the direct product of three one - dimensional generalized cantor sets ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcantorset ] ) .",
    "this means that the point @xmath41 belongs to the three - dimensional set if and only if each of the coordinates @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 belongs to the one - dimensional set .",
    "the fractal ( hausdorff ) dimension of the one - dimensional generalized cantor set is three times smaller than that of the three - dimensional set [ equation  ( [ dimension ] ) ] .",

    "for example , a ball of arbitrary radius @xmath51 in the center of the cell can be used as an initiator instead of the initial cube ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3dcantorset ] , lower panel ) .",
    "one can see that the fractal dimension is still given by [ equation  ( [ dimension ] ) ] .",

    "the masses are embedded in a solid matrix , which can be associated with the  pores \" discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "the particles are also immersed in the solid matrix or dissolved in a solution of the same scattering length density as pores .",
    "the scattering length densities are @xmath52 for the mass and @xmath53 for the pores .",
    "they are determined by the relation @xmath54 , where the summation is over the scattering centers located in the volume @xmath55 .",
    "the difference @xmath56 is called the scattering contrast . in what follows , we mean by particle the @xmath33th approximant to the generalized cantor set .",
    "the neutron scattering cross section per unit volume of a sample is given in  @xcite as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is momentum transfer , @xmath59 is the number of particles per unit volume and @xmath60 is the total volume of the mass in the particle .",

    "here we assume that the particles are randomly oriented in space and their positions are not correlated .",
    "the latter means that we neglect particle interactions and put the interparticle structure factor equal to 1 , which is quite reasonable if the average distance between the particles is sufficiently large .",
    "if the probability of any orientation is the same , then the mean value can be calculated by averaging over all directions @xmath65 of the momentum transfer @xmath66 , that is , by integrating over the solid angle in the spherical coordinates @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70    once we know the absolute values of the intensity [ equation  ( [ cross ] ) ] , the concentration of fractals and the contrast , we can obtain the fractal volume from the scattering at zero momentum .",
