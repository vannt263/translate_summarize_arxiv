    "the relationship between quantum theory and the gravitational field is a very special one @xcite .",
    "while standard quantum ( field ) theory is formulated on a fixed background , gravity is described by a dynamical spacetime .",
    "this difference is the major obstacle for a consistent quantization .",
    "black holes are assumed to play a key role in the search for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "this is because they obey laws which are closely analogous to the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "the interpretation of these laws necessarily invokes quantum theory because classically a black hole can not radiate and thus can not be attributed a temperature . using the formalism of quantum field theory on a classical dynamical spacetime",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , hawking has shown that black holes radiate with a temperature proportional to @xmath0 , which in the case of a schwarzschild black hole is given by @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation and consequences of this temperature are still subject of investigations ; see , for example , @xcite for a recent review . if this radiation were exactly thermal and if the black hole evaporated completely , any initial ( quantum ) state would evolve into the same final thermal state , in violation of the unitary time evolution of ordinary quantum theory .",
    "this `` information - loss problem '' can eventually only be solved within a final theory of quantum gravity .",
    "besides particle creation , an important effect in black - hole spacetimes is vacuum polarization @xcite . a similar effect in flat spacetime occurs in the presence of nontrivial boundaries  the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the physical reality of this effect has been empirically confirmed in a variety of experiments @xcite . in its classic formulation ,",
    "the casimir effect is the attraction of two neutral conducting plates at zero temperature as a result of a quantum pressure induced by vacuum fluctuations . even before",
    ", casimir and polder have investigated the attraction between an atom and a perfectly conducting wall as well as between two atoms @xcite .",
    "both casimir and casimir - polder forces have been explored in the presence of boundary conditions and nontrivial backgrounds which can modify the quantization conditions of the field modes and accordingly the structure of correlations in the quantum vacuum .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent study of the casimir - polder interaction in graphene .    in this paper",
    ", we address the casimir - polder interaction between two atoms . when embedded in a quantum vacuum , they experience a force as a result of local dipoles spontaneously induced on them by correlated zero - point vacuum fluctuations .",
    "we consider this interaction in a black - hole spacetime and thus present a situation in which the quantum aspects of black holes _ and _ the quantum aspects of the standard casimir - polder force are intertwined . in this respect",
    ", we also remark the existence of a number of previous studies on the gravitation interaction of the casimir energy  @xcite .",
    "a useful technique , widely employed in the literature , is a method developed by dalibard , dupont - roc , and cohen - tannoudji ( ddc ) in order to separate in perturbation theory the distinct contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to radiative shifts of atomic energy levels  @xcite .",
    "the method was originally formulated to treat a small system coupled to a reservoir @xcite ; in this case , it was shown that two types of physical processes contribute to the evolution of an observable , those where the fluctuation of the reservoir polarizes the system and those where it is the system itself that polarizes the reservoir .",
    "if the system is a quantized field , we call the former vacuum fluctuations and the latter radiation reaction contributions .    in second order perturbation theory ,",
    "the aforementioned method has been successfully applied to computing space - dependent radiative shifts of atoms in front of a reflecting plate  also known as atom - plate casimir force  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has also been employed to investigate the radiative processes of entangled atoms in minkowski spacetime  @xcite and also in the presence of an event horizon  @xcite .",
    "however , only recently the method by ddc has been extended to fourth order in perturbation theory for atoms linearly coupled to a scalar field  @xcite , as necessary to compute the casimir - polder force between two polarizable , neutral atoms in their respective ground states .      _",
    "( i ) casimir - polder interaction in a black - hole spacetime  _",
    "we examine the casimir - polder interaction between two identical two - level atoms in a schwarzschild spacetime , linearly coupled with the quantum fluctuations of a scalar field prepared in the boulware , hartle - hawking , and unruh vacuum states .",
    "similar computations have already been performed with a different atomic configuration , considering an electromagnetic field and employing the method of equal - time spatial vacuum field fluctuations  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explore a broader variety of parameters , considering the interplay of the interatomic distance , energy level spacing of the atoms , and the surface gravity of the black hole .",
    "in particular , we highlight the regimes where the casimir - polder force exhibits a nonthermal scaling with the interatomic distance ; indeed , while for certain choices of parameters , the casimir interaction displays a thermal character linked to its hawking temperature , at large enough interatomic separations , and close to the black - hole horizon , the noninertial character of the background metric modifies the scaling of the force in a nonthermal fashion .",
    "we derive these results calculating the vacuum fluctuation and radiation reaction contributions to the casimir - polder interaction at fourth order in perturbation theory in the atom - field coupling strength ( see for a derivation  @xcite ) .",
    "the vacuum fluctuation term can be interpreted as the fluctuations of the zero - point field inducing local dipoles on the atoms , which leads to a coupling between the atoms , while the radiation reaction term reflects the opposite mechanism : when one of the atom experiences quantum fluctuations , it polarizes the remainder of the system ( the field and the other atom ) .",

    "close to the event horizon , the schwarzschild metric takes the form of the rindler line element , and we find that the characteristic exponent of the algebraic scaling discussed in  @xcite is perfectly mirrored in the large interatomic separation scaling of the casimir force close to the black hole .",
    "the nonthermal correction to the casimir interaction is imprinted by the noninertial character of the background metric which becomes sizeable at distances larger than the inverse of the surface gravity of the black hole , that is , larger than @xmath2 .",

    "<S> the two crossovers are a consequence of the noninertial character of the background where the field mediating the casimir interaction propagates . while in the former case </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic crossover length scale is proportional to the inverse of the surface gravity of the black hole , in the latter it is determined by the inverse of the proper acceleration of the atoms . </S>"
