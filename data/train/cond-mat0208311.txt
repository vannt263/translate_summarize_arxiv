    "in studying charge carrier ( electron or hole ) transport in organic crystals , one avoids the use of standard band theoretic approaches @xcite since the carrier bandwidth is not an overwhelmingly large energy in organic , in contrast to inorganic , materials @xcite .",
    "mean free paths calculated on the basis of bare band - theoretic descriptions have been explicitly found to be smaller than a lattice constant @xcite .",
    "such findings have necessitated polaronic or hopping theories of transport in organic materials @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether this trend @xcite away from bare - band theory , which has continued in the literature on organic materials in recent times @xcite , needs to be revised or at least modified in light of recent observations @xcite and calculations @xcite on pentacene . the large low - temperature mobility in these materials ( orders of magnitude larger than values reported earlier @xcite at other temperatures and in other organics ) , sharp power - law dependence of the mobility on temperature in a wide range @xcite , and nonlinear saturation phenomena @xcite which have been interpreted @xcite in terms of large bandwidths",
    ", all could point to the need for bare - band theory to be considered seriously in organic materials .",
    "on the other hand , the bandwidths are believed @xcite not to be of the order of several ev s as in inorganic materials but smaller .",
    "one concludes , therefore , that required is a description valid for _ intermediate _ bandwidths ( @xmath0 ) . to begin the construction of such",
    "a description is the main purpose of the present note .",
    "temperature - dependent ( huang - rhys ) @xmath0 s arise in polaronic transport @xcite . in the past , effective bare @xmath0 s , which undergo reduction by polaronic effects in the presence of strong interactions with vibrations , were themselves believed ( or shown ) to be rather small .",
    "with naphthalene as an example , @xmath1 @xmath2 ev , the polaronically reduced @xmath0 is about a tenth of this value in light of the magnitude of the coupling constants and is thus well surpassed by the thermal energy @xmath3 .",
    "the latter exceeds @xmath4 mev corresponding to @xmath5 k , the lowest temperature in the naphthalene observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , although past explanations of mobility observations have certainly made use of the temperature dependence of polaronic bandwidths @xcite to address decreasing mobility with increasing temperature @xcite , polaronic calculations have served as the investigational procedure .",
    "band considerations have either not been used at all @xcite or assigned a less important role @xcite .",
    "estimates in pentacene raise the possibility that @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath0 for a part of the observations .",
    "to show the results of a simple combination capable of blending finite - band theory and polaronic concepts , is a secondary purpose of the present note .",
    "band - theoretic descriptions in inorganic materials effectively take the bandwidth @xmath0 to be infinite .",
    "the well - known textbook formula for the mobility @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the carrier charge , energy , temperature , velocity , density of states , and relaxation time , respectively , has @xmath14 as the upper limit of the energy integrations .",
    "we will explore , instead , the consequences of replacing it by the finite value of @xmath0 , suitably modifying the density of states .",
    "we consider a one - band model , which means merely that the band gap is taken to be large enough to make interband transitions unimportant , and assume a simple @xmath15 having the free - electronic form within the band and to vanish outside : @xmath16\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the heaviside step function and @xmath18 is the number of sites .",
    "it is easy to show that the carrier velocity @xmath19 is @xmath20 the constant @xmath21 equals @xmath22 if the system is isotropic in three dimensions , @xmath23 being the lattice constant , given that the charge carriers are fermionic ( @xmath24 spin values per orbital state ) .",
    "the thermal distribution in ( [ mu ] ) is classical for the standard reasons that the carriers being injected are so small in number , e.g. , in time - of - flight observations , that the fermi distribution is well approximated by a maxwell distribution .",
    "although space - charge limited conditions of measurement are common now for some experimental setups such as in field - effect - transistor geometry , we will assume here that this assumption is valid .",
    "if the need arises , it can always be relaxed in subsequent calculations .    our present purpose being to get at the simplest consequences of finite @xmath0 as economically as possible , for most of the calculations here",
    ", we will first take the relaxation time @xmath25 to have no energy dependence .",
    "such a case appears in an early analysis of erginsoy @xcite .",
    "whether the entire set of assumptions behind erginsoy s analysis applies to organic crystals is of no importance in the present context .",
    "our interest lies only in exploring , in the first instance , the consequences of a constant @xmath25 in a finite band system .",
    "the finite - band generalization of ( [ mu ] ) is then @xmath26 displayed in ( [ twomu ] ) , is the dimensionless ratio @xmath27 of the mobility to @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the ` scattering energy ' @xmath30 . the dimensionless mobility @xmath27 has been expressed in terms of the dimensionless ratios of the bandwidth to the scattering energy and to the thermal energy : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "while both expressions in ( [ twomu ] ) are exact , they can be used respectively in opposite limits most conveniently : @xmath33 this @xmath0 to @xmath34 transition as one goes from large bands to small bands arises from the occupation of states in the band .",
    "the mobility , which involves the thermal average of the square of the velocity , is proportional to @xmath35 , the product of @xmath0 and the thermal energy in the large bandwidth case , but to @xmath34 in the small bandwidth case , because the temperature is so large with respect to @xmath36 that it makes no contribution : all states in the band are occupied equally .",
    "the transition takes on different character if the relaxation time @xmath25 is energy - dependent , the limiting exponents of @xmath0 being different from @xmath37 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the two different ways of scaling the energy apparent in ( [ twomu ] ) are particular cases @xmath38 and @xmath39 of scaling with an arbitrary quantity @xmath40 having the dimensions of energy : @xmath41 this general expression can be used in additional ways such as by taking @xmath42@xmath43 in that case , extreme limits of @xmath31 can be studied  if it is very large , which represents the large mean free path case , @xmath27 is proportional to a ratio of laplace transforms of powers , with @xmath44 as the laplace variable .",
    "the three representations of the mobility given above are useful in understanding limiting behavior of carrier transport in extremes of the three respective ratios of @xmath45 @xmath3 , and @xmath29 .",
    "generally , one can identify the integrals in ( [ twomu ] ) with incomplete gamma functions @xmath46 defined via @xmath47 and write , exactly , i.e. , for arbitrary relative values of @xmath45 @xmath48 and @xmath29 , @xmath49 which can easily be shown to lead to the various respective limits , or rewritten in other ways such as in terms only of error functions and exponentials through the use of the chain condition @xmath50 and the relation @xmath51",
    "the sharpness of the power laws in the temperature dependence of the observed @xmath52 in organic crystals , whether in the recent experiments on pentacene @xcite or in experiments on other crystals such as naphthalene reported a couple of decades back @xcite , is impressive . although giuggioli et al .",
    "@xcite have shown recently that visually acceptable fits to the data can be produced by a band theory addressing the partial range of pentacene data from 20 - 400 k by combining acoustic and phonon scattering , it is interesting to ask if a true power law form can be obtained as an _ analytic limit _ from the expressions .",
    "the following simplified approach produces such as a limit .",
    "assume that the mechanism of scattering is such that the relaxation time @xmath25 depends both on the carrier energy @xmath53 and the temperature @xmath10 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are a characteristic energy , time , and temperature respectively .",
    "such expressions arise naturally in many contexts .",
    "thus , @xmath58 in many semiconductors @xcite , and @xmath59 for acoustic phonon scattering at high temperatures . equation ( [ mu ] ) then yields @xmath60 whether or not this appears as a power form depends on the particular @xmath10 dependence of the ratio of the @xmath61-functions . for @xmath62 ,",
    "one recovers ( [ gammamu ] ) except for the explicit @xmath63 factor . for @xmath64 , the @xmath46-functions cancel and",
    "the mobility is seen to display a clear temperature law @xmath65 in such a case the value @xmath66could conceivably correspond to the observed @xmath67 dependence in pentacene @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that , even if the value of @xmath68 is not @xmath37 , a sharp power law may indeed be the direct apparent consequence of the assumed @xmath13 in an appropriate ( although limited ) range of temperature , provided the ratio of the @xmath61-functions in ( [ powermu ] ) is largely @xmath69-independent in that range .",
    "if polaronic effects are present in carrier transport , it could be argued @xcite that some of the physics might be captured by invoking the well - known huang - rhys dependence @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the bare bandwidth , and its exponential reduction occurs as a result of strong interaction via the coupling constant @xmath72 with vibrations of frequency @xmath73 .",
    "for instance , the substitution of ( [ hr ] ) in the simple constant-@xmath25 version ( [ gammamu ] ) would yield the normalized mobility @xmath74 } } { 3/2}\\left [ \\frac{\\gamma \\left ( \\frac{5}{2},\\frac{\\widetilde{b}}{k_{b}t}\\right ) } { \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{% 3}{2},\\frac{\\widetilde{b}}{k_{b}t}\\right ) } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{adhoc}\\ ] ] equation ( [ adhoc ] ) displays the qualitative trend of the low temperature data , but not of the high temperature data , in the acenes .",
    "furthermore , there is always a large enough temperature at which the huang - rhys factors reduce the polaron bandwidth enough to make the mean free path smaller than a lattice constant .",
    "this forces the band calculation to lose its accuracy and , indeed , its applicability .",
    "crystal momentum becomes an inadequate quantum number in such a case , and a hopping description becomes necessary .",
    "in particular , a bridging of the present finite - band calculations and of polaronic theories developed earlier @xcite is required . how would one carry out such a combination ?",
    "this important and difficult question , along with application to pentacene observations , is being addressed in our ongoing work . here",
    "we sketch a simplified answer to the question .",
    "polaronic mobility theory for narrow bands has been successfully applied @xcite more than a decade ago to naphthalene observations @xcite on the basis of an expression , which , in one of its most simplified forms , may be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a numerical constant and @xmath77 is a modified bessel function .",
    "the scattering rate @xmath78 is essentially the constant @xmath79 appearing in band expressions shown earlier in this note .",
    "the expression comes about from the time integration of the velocity autocorrelation function@xmath80 the velocity autocorrelation function is a product of a polaron part which arises from the interaction of the charge carrier with vibrations and a part @xmath81 which arises from interaction with static defects @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ polaron ] ) is appropriate to a narrow band .",
    "an extension of the narrow - band expression to an intermediate - band situation may be made by using the calculation given earlier in this note to obtain the static part @xmath81 .",
    "it leads to the replacement of @xmath78 in ( [ polaron ] ) by an effective @xmath78 which is dependent on @xmath10 and @xmath82 in addition to being proportional to the constant @xmath79 .",
    "the result is ( with @xmath83 a numerical constant ) @xmath84 i_{0}\\left (   \\frac{2g^{2}}{\\sinh \\left ( \\frac{\\hbar \\omega } { 2k_{b}t}\\right ) } \\right )   \\label{grand}\\ ] ] the general result ( [ grand ] ) combines the polaronic and band - theoretic character in a simple way .",
    "it reduces to the polaronic form ( [ polaron ] ) for large @xmath10 , i.e. , for @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the reduced bandwidth given by ( [ hr ] ) . in this limit , the reduced band is fully occupied and the ratio of the two @xmath61-functions simplifies to @xmath87 in the opposite limit of small temperatures , @xmath88 , the occupation of the band is controlled by the temperature , the zero-@xmath10 limit of the ratio of the @xmath46-functions is simply @xmath89 and ( [ grand ] ) simplifies to the band result . indeed ,",
    "if also @xmath90 @xmath91 , the argument of the @xmath92-bessel function is negligible and the bessel function is simply @xmath93 the mobility then reduces to ( [ bs ] ) with the zero-@xmath10 reduced bandwidth @xmath94 in place of @xmath0 in ( [ bs ] ) . generally , the mobility , normalized to its @xmath95 value , is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the right hand side of ( [ adhoc ] ) .",
    "the _ ad hoc _ expression ( [ adhoc ] ) obtained by straightforward substitution of the bare bandwidth @xmath0 by the polaronic reduced bandwidth @xmath98 in ( [ gammamu ] ) differs precisely by the introduction in ( [ last ] ) of the bessel function factor .",
    "this agrees with the well known fact @xcite that the excess of that factor over @xmath37 represents the hopping contribution of the mobility .",
    "we plot ( [ last ] ) in fig .",
    "1 . parameters chosen are arbitrary but illustrate the respective behaviors reported in the literature for naphthalene where a flat temperature dependence is observed @xcite , and for pentacene where a turn - over with increasing mobility in the higher temperature region dependence has been reported @xcite .",
    "through simplified calculations , we have presented here arguments towards an intermediate finite - bandwidth theory which extends previous narrow - band treatments .",
    "the new results obtained are : finite - band effects stemming from full occupation of the band at temperatures large enough so that the thermal energy exceeds the bandwidth , @xmath0 to @xmath34 transition of the mobility dependence on the bandwidth with variation of temperature , an indication of how power laws might arise as analytical limits of appropriate scattering mechanisms , the specific form of the mobility under the _ ad hoc _ huang - rhys temperature dependence of the bandwidths and the relation of such an expression to polaronic expressions , and a usable interpolation formula which combines polaronic and bare - band characters .",
    "these calculations should by no means be treated as a complete theory of polaronic and band effects .",
    "more realistic analyses of the band transport are being carried out by giuggioli et al .",
    "@xcite , taking into account acoustic and optical phonon interactions which lead to striking new finite - band effects .",
    "while not totally accurate , the simple truncated free - carrier density of states used here has the correct broad ( bare ) band limit in contrast to gaussian forms @xcite and should , therefore , be able to capture the essential physics at that end .",
    "it is hoped that the present simple calculations will contribute towards the construction of a general picture of quasiparticle transport in pure organic crystals which treats both the temperature dependence of the mobility , and high field effects such as velocity saturation that have been treated recently @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge conversations with john andersen , luca giuggioli and paul parris .",
