    "the scattering of partial waves by a central perturbating potential is fully characterized by the scattering matrix . beyond the born approximation , this matrix , which reduces to a scalar in the absence of coupling ,",

    "these functions satisfy a system of four coupled non - linear first - order differential equations .",
