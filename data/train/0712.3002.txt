    "<S> the collisions of three - dimensional bright solitary matter waves formed from atomic bose - einstein condensates are shown to exhibit rich behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> collisions range from being elastic to completely destructive due to the onset of collapse during the interaction . through a detailed quantitative analysis we map out the role of relative phase , impact speed and interaction strength . in particular , we identify the importance of the collapse time in the onset of unstable collisions and show how the relative phase controls a population transfer between the waves . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis enables us to interpret recent experimental observations of bright solitary matter waves .    </S>",
    "<S> solitons are intriguing nonlinear wavepackets that propagate without dispersion due to the counteracting nonlinearity of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> they occur widely in nature , for example , in nonlinear optics , water , mechanics , biological systems , astrophysics , geology and particle physics @xcite . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , solitonic matter waves have been realised in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in bright @xcite , dark @xcite and gap @xcite forms . here </S>",
    "<S> the atomic interactions introduce a nonlinearity to the system such that , at zero - temperature and on a mean - field level , the bec satisfies a cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite and supports the well - known one - dimensional soliton solutions derived by zakharov and shabat @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bright solitons are supported by attractive atomic interactions and manifest themselves as self - trapped droplets of matter . </S>",
    "<S> although these solitons are technically one - dimensional solutions , the analogous structure in 3d is a bright solitary wave ( bsw ) @xcite . under radial confinement , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. in an atomic waveguide potential , these states are self - trapped in the axial direction . due to their novel properties of self - trapping and shape - preservation , </S>",
    "<S> bright solitary matter waves hold strong advantages for applications such as for atom optics and interferometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , attractive becs in 2d/3d suffer from a collapse instability when the atom number becomes too large @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most interesting aspects of solitons are their collisions and recent experiments have probed the collisions of matter wave bsws @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite generated multiple matter - wave bsws @xcite and observed their dynamics in a trap . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , two bsws were observed to oscillate in anti - phase along the axial direction of the harmonic trap for over @xmath0  s , colliding in the trap centre approximately 40 times . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of these dynamics was somewhat surprising given the almost three - dimensional trap geometry and the combined population of the bsws exceeding the critical atom number for collapse . in the 1d limit , soliton interactions have been well - expounded , with the force between two solitons known to depend sinusoidally on their relative phase @xmath1 @xcite . for @xmath2 , the symmetric wavepackets can overlap freely , leading to an ` attractive ' interaction , while for @xmath3 the asymmetric wavefunction prevents overlap and leads to a ` repulsive ' interaction @xcite . in this 1d limit </S>",
    "<S> the collisions are always elastic and the relative phase does not change the final outgoing states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast colliding bsws in 3d can form a high - density state that is unstable to collapse @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the relative phase plays a crucial role , with an ` attractive ' @xmath4 collision being prone to the collapse instability and a ` repulsive ' @xmath5 collision predicted to negate collapse effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent work @xcite also indicates that the collisional speed is also crucial in the stability of bsw collisions . in the majority of theoretical studies of bsw collisions , </S>",
    "<S> approximations have been employed to simplify the approach , for example , by reduction of the 3d dynamics to an effective 1d model @xcite or the use of a variational approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although full 3d simulations of bsw collisions have been made @xcite , a detailed study of the relevant parameter space is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> we note that analogous effects are observed for optical solitons in saturable nonlinear media @xcite and solitonic q - balls in particle physics @xcite , including soliton fusion and annihilation .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically analyse the rich behaviour of the collisions of three - dimensional bright solitary matter waves . </S>",
    "<S> this is performed through extensive numerical simulations of the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",

    "<S> in general the collisions are stable for low values of @xmath19 but become unstable as @xmath19 increases towards @xmath20 . at low speeds the extent of the unstable region is dependent on the relative phase @xmath1 , as illustrated by comparing figs . [ </S>",

    "<S> although a @xmath6-phase difference suppresses collapse between the colliding bsws , it does not completely prevent it . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile of the bsws alters as they approach , leading to an enhanced peak density . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath39 is increased this enhancement becomes larger and thus the threshold for instability initially moves to lower values of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath56 , the threshold moves to higher values of @xmath19 and ultimately approaches @xmath20 .    at the transition between stable and unstable collisions , we observe a narrow region of inelastic collisions , where the outgoing bsws have modified shape and speed due to the occurrence of partial collapse during the collision . </S>",

    "<S> the outcome becomes independent of @xmath59 , as illustrated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1b](b)(i ) and ( c)(i ) . </S>",

    "<S> comparison to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1a](a ) shows that the axial trapping shifts the threshold for instability to lower values of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for more ( less ) spherical traps the transition lines get shifted to lower ( higher ) values of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> since multiple collisions can occur in the trap , we also probe the collisional stability after @xmath51 collisions ( grey lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1b](a ) ) for @xmath4 ( solid line ) and @xmath6 ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between stable / unstable collisions gets shifted to even lower values of @xmath19 .    in the jila experiment </S>",
    "<S> , the two bsws can be clearly resolved when they are at the outer turning points of their oscillatory motion in the harmonic trap , revealing their maximum displacement to be @xmath60 m . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate their collisional speed to be @xmath61 . the point corresponding to the jila experiment is indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1b](a ) by the cross . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath4 we see that the jila bsws are stable after one collision but are destroyed by @xmath51 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast for @xmath3 the jila bsws are stable even after @xmath51 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> given that over @xmath51 stable oscillations were observed in the jila experiment , this gives strong evidence towards the existence of a @xmath6-phase difference in the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the stability of bsw collisions is a play off between the timescale over which the bsw interact @xmath62 and the characteristic time for collapse to occur @xmath63 : if @xmath64 then the passing wavepackets do not have time to collapse ; however , if @xmath65 , the collapse has sufficient time to develop during the collision . based on this idea , the onset of instability in high speed collisions will be dominated by the collapse timescale @xmath63 and this would imply that onset of instability is independent of @xmath1 , as observed in our simulations . consider just one @xmath4 collision in the jila system ( @xmath33 , @xmath26 ) . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1b](a ) , the critical speed for collapse is @xmath66 . we can estimate the interaction time at this speed as @xmath67 . from @xcite the size of the jila wavepacket is @xmath68 m , giving @xmath69ms . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic timescale for interaction - induced collapse has been measured experimentally in this system to be @xmath70ms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , at the point at which we observe the onset of unstable collisions , @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives evidence to support this proposal . </S>",
    "<S> due to the lack of experimental data and an accurate theoretical model for collapse times @xcite , we can not currently extend upon this prediction .    for the cases of @xmath4 and @xmath6 considered so far , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the density is symmetric about the origin throughout the dynamics . for intermediate phases @xmath72 , </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3](a ) for two identical bsws ( @xmath33 ) colliding with relative phase @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric collision induces a considerable population transfer between the waves , generating a highly - populated and lowly - populated bsw . to conserve momentum , the highly ( lowly)-populated bsw travels at reduced ( increased ) speed .    </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the population transfer after the collision by the ratio @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the number of atoms transferred and @xmath77 is the initial population of each bsw . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) we plot @xmath75 as a function of relative phase @xmath1 for the collision of two @xmath33 bsws at various speeds . at the highest speed ( dots ) the population transfer varies sinusoidally with @xmath1 , reaching a peak at @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> however , at lower speed ( circles ) the population transfer becomes skewed , with the peak moving towards @xmath79 . at the lowest speed presented ( crosses ) </S>",
    "<S> the population transfer appears to diverge as @xmath80 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4](a ) which maps out the population transfer in the parameter space of @xmath39 and @xmath1 for @xmath33 . here </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see that the population transfer is maximal for low speeds and decays with @xmath39 . around @xmath81 and at low @xmath39 , we find a small region where the bsw overlap is so great that a collapse instability is induced . </S>",
    "<S> for an increased value of @xmath82 this unstable region becomes larger , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the collisions are unstable to collapse due to maximal overlap of the waves.,width=302 ]    we have performed an approximate two - mode analysis of this problem , similar to that performed for becs in static double well potentials @xcite , but with each mode being propagated at constant speed @xmath39 through each other . </S>",
    "<S> when closely positioned , josephson - like tunnelling occurs between the states , with the final population transfer depending sinusoidally on @xmath1 and decaying exponentially with @xmath39 due to the reduced interaction time . </S>",
    "<S> this is in qualitative agreement with the gpe simulations , suggesting that josephson - like tunnelling is the key process . </S>",
