    "as the temperature is lowered , some inorganic and organic conductors with a highly anisotropic crystal and electronic structure become unstable and undergo a peierls transition , i.e.  they develop a charge - density wave .",

    "section [ section : formalism ] focuses on the one - particle green function of the fgm . after calculating the green function in the leading - order born approximation which reproduces the result obtained by lee , rice and anderson",

    "the introduction of phase variables will turn out to be very convenient .",
    "while one phase variable is simply related to the integrated dos and satisfies a non - linear equation of motion which is equivalent to a riccati equation , the other phase variable is related to the inverse localization length and can be expressed in terms of the first phase variable .",
    "these equations of motions will serve as the starting point for detailed calculations of the dos and inverse localization length for various probability distributions of the disorder potentials in the next sections .    in section [ chap : whitenoise ] , we will review known exact results of the dos and inverse localization length in the limit of infinite correlation lengths and in the white noise limit . generalizing the phase formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite such that @xmath1 is allowed to be complex , we will derive a linear fourth - order fokker - planck equation previously only obtained within the framework of the method of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the solution of this stationary fokker - planck equation encapsulates all known results for the dos and inverse localization length of the fgm in the white noise limit including the above mentioned dyson singularity in the ovchinnikov and erikhman limit .",
    "results for the case of infinite correlation lengths will finally be obtained by averaging the dos and the inverse localization length calculated for a constant disorder potential over an appropriate probability distribution of the disorder potentials .",
    "the case of finite correlation lengths of the order parameter field will be attacked in section [ section : finite_xi ] .",
    "considering the equation of motion related to the integrated dos , we will first argue that we expect for any finite @xmath4 a dyson singularity in the dos .",
    "we will then set up an algorithm based on the equations of motion derived in section [ section : formalism ] which will allow for a simultaneous numerical calculation of the dos and inverse localization length for arbitrary disorder potentials with unprecedented accuracy .",

    "in this work , we have discussed the density of states ( dos ) of the fluctuating gap model ( fgm ) and related quantities like the inverse localization length , the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility and the low - temperature specific heat .",
    "we introduced the fgm as an effective low - energy model describing the electronic properties of peierls chains and emphasized the fact that the fgm also finds its applications in other physical contexts : spin chains can be mapped by a jordan - wigner transformation onto the fgm and in order to explain the pseudogap - phenomenon in underdoped cuprates above a phase transition , higher - dimensional generalizations of the fgm have been used .    with the rediscovery of the fgm in the context of high - temperature superconductivity , a previously unnoticed subtle error in sadovskii s widely used green function of the fgm was brought to light .",
    "this error called for a reinvestigation of the fgm .    after setting up a non - perturbative theory which , in principle , allows to express the one - particle green function as a functional of an arbitrary given realization of the disorder",
    ", we derived a simple equation of motion whose solution determines the dos and the inverse localization length . starting from this equation",
    ", we could rederive all known results for the fgm in the white noise limit .    considering the equation of motion governed by the phase which determines the dos",
    ", we argued that the dyson singularity found in the white noise limit for commensurate peierls chains should not be an artifact of the white noise limit , but should be present for any finite correlation length in contradiction to sadovskii s solution .",
    "our following numerical calculation of the dos and inverse localization length confirmed this prediction and showed also that for large correlation lengths , the dyson singularity only overshadows a pseudogap .",
    "although sadovskii s algorithm misses this singularity , his solutions for the incommensurate case where there are no singularities in the dos give a fairly good approximation to the exact result .    in the pseudogap - regime below the mean - field critical temperature , fluctuations of the order parameter can not be described by gaussian statistics . instead ,",
    "as the temperature is lowered , amplitude fluctuations get gradually frozen out , and the amplitude takes on a value given by the minimum of the ginzburg - landau functional and only long - wavelength gapless phase fluctuations survive . using a gauge transformation to map the phase fluctuations of the order parameter onto an effective forward scattering potential",
    ", we could even find an exact solution for the fgm involving only phase fluctuations which should be valid in the low temperature regime .",
    "we found that the low - temperature specific heat is linear in @xmath321 and that both the dos at the fermi energy and the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility vanish exponentially as the temperature @xmath321 is lowered , the ratio of the former to the latter also vanishing exponentially . the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility has been measured in various experiments and is in good agreement with our results .",
    "having discussed quantities related to the dos , one would also like to calculate quantities like the spectral function .",
    "this has been done for a special non - gaussian probability distribution involving amplitude and phase fluctuations in ref .",
    "@xcite , but accurate results for realistic probability distributions ( e.g.  for phase fluctuations only ) are not known yet .",
