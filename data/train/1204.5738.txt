    "typical grains used in the spectroscopic experiments are in the ballistic regime , i.e. , their size is smaller than the mean free path , and electron transport is determined by scattering from the boundaries of the grain rather than from impurities . when the boundaries are sufficiently irregular , the single - particle dynamics are chaotic .",
    "this induces sample - specific fluctuations of observables , and the meaningful quantities are the statistical distributions of these observables ; see ref .   and references therein .",
    "the single - particle energies and wave functions follow the statistics of the random - matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite in a thouless energy window @xmath0 around the fermi energy , where @xmath0 is determined by the time it takes for an electron to move across the grain .",
    "when @xmath0 is much larger than the single - particle mean level spacing @xmath1 , the grain is described by the so - called universal hamiltonian .",

    "these three interaction terms are universal , i.e. , they are independent of the particular realization of the single - particle hamiltonian . here",
    "we assume @xmath4 so that we are below stoner instability of macroscopic polarization .    when the pairing term is suppressed , ( i.e. , when only charging and exchange terms contribute ) , thermodynamic observables of the universal hamiltonian can be calculated in closed form using a spin - projection method .",

    "the effect of both pairing and exchange correlations on the thermodynamic properties of the grain ( heat capacity and spin susceptibility ) was studied in ref .   for the case of an equally spaced single - particle spectrum by using a quantum monte carlo method .",
    "these thermodynamic quantities can also be calculated directly from the eigenvalues of the universal hamiltonian using richardson s solution , modified to take into account the exchange interaction .",
    "@xcite the combined effect of exchange and pairing interactions on the spin susceptibility as a function of magnetic field at zero temperature was studied in ref .  .",
    "in this work , we study the general problem of mesoscopic fluctuations of thermodynamic properties of the grain in the presence of both pairing and exchange correlations assuming spin - orbit coupling is negligible . the quantum monte carlo method and richardson s solution mentioned above are computationally intensive , and are less practical in calculating the mesoscopic fluctuations of thermodynamic properties for which many realizations of the grain must be studied .",

    "<S> we study the mesoscopic fluctuations of thermodynamic observables in a nanosized metallic grain in which the single - particle dynamics are chaotic and the dimensionless thouless conductance is large . such a grain is modeled by the universal hamiltonian describing the competition between exchange and pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange term is taken into account exactly by a spin - projection method , and the pairing term is treated in the static - path approximation together with small - amplitude quantal fluctuations around each static fluctuation of the pairing field . </S>",
    "<S> odd - even particle - number effects induced by pairing correlations are included using a number - parity projection . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the exchange interaction shifts the number - parity effects in the heat capacity and spin susceptibility to lower temperatures . in the regime where the pairing gap is similar to or smaller than the single - particle mean level spacing , </S>",
    "<S> these number - parity effects are suppressed by exchange correlations , and the fluctuations of the spin susceptibility may be particularly large . however , for larger values of the pairing gap , the number - parity effects may be enhanced by exchange correlations . </S>"
