    "given a closed , connected , orientable surface @xmath1 , the associated _ curve graph _ , @xmath3 , has as vertex set the set of isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves in @xmath1 , with an edge between two distinct vertices if the corresponding isotopy classes have representatives that are disjoint .",
    "the definition is due to harvey @xcite .",
    "the curve graph has been a significant tool in the study of mapping class groups , teichmller spaces and hyperbolic 3manifolds . if @xmath1 has genus at least 2 , @xmath3 is connected , and masur and minsky showed in @xcite that it has infinite diameter and is hyperbolic in the sense of gromov .",
    "more recently , it was shown in independent proofs by aougab @xcite , bowditch @xcite , clay , rafi and schleimer @xcite and hensel , przytycki and webb @xcite that the constant of hyperbolicity can be chosen to be independent of the surface @xmath1 .    when @xmath1 is a boundary component of a compact , orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 , we can consider the subset of the vertex set of @xmath3 which consists of those curves which bound embedded discs in @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , by dehn s lemma , these are the essential simple closed curves in @xmath1 which are homotopically trivial in @xmath2 . the _ disc graph _ ,",
    "@xmath4 , is the full subgraph spanned by these vertices .",
    "this has applications to the study of handlebody groups and heegaard splittings . in a further paper of masur and minsky @xcite",
    ", it was proved that @xmath4 is @xmath0quasiconvex in @xmath3 ( see section 2 for a definition ) , for some @xmath0 depending only on the genus of @xmath1 .",
    "the proof relies on a study of nested train track sequences .",
    "more specifically , to any pair of vertices of @xmath4 , masur and minsky associate a sequence of curves in @xmath4 , and a nested train track sequence whose vertex cycles are close in @xmath3 to the curves of this sequence .",
    "they prove that the sets of vertex cycles of nested train track sequences are quasiconvex in @xmath3 , and the result follows .",
    "this result was improved by aougab , who showed in @xcite that the constants of quasiconvexity for nested train track sequences can be taken to be quadratic in the complexity of the surface , obtaining as a corollary that there exists a function @xmath5 such that @xmath4 is @xmath6quasiconvex in @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is the genus of @xmath1 . that this bound can be taken to be uniform in the genus of @xmath1 follows from work of hamenstdt @xcite . in section 3 of @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the sets of vertex cycles of train track splitting sequences give unparametrised quasigeodesics in @xmath3 with constants independent of the surface @xmath1 .",
    "along with the uniform hyperbolicity of the curve graphs , this implies that such subsets are uniformly quasiconvex in @xmath3 . in this note",
    ", we give a direct proof of the uniform quasiconvexity of @xmath4 in @xmath3 , without using train tracks .",
    "[ uniform ] there exists @xmath0 such that , for any compact , orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 and boundary component @xmath1 of @xmath2 , the disc graph , @xmath4 , is @xmath0-quasiconvex in @xmath3 .    for the main case ,",
    "where the genus of @xmath1 is at least 2 , this uses an observation that the disc surgeries of @xcite give a path of `` bicorn curves '' , as described by przytycki and sisto in @xcite .",
    "these were introduced by analogy with the `` unicorn arcs '' of @xcite in order to give a short surgery proof of the uniform hyperbolicity of the curve graphs .",
    "the lower genus case is straight - forward , and is discussed in section [ low genus ] .",

    "a simple closed curve in a surface @xmath1 is said to be _ essential _ if it does not bound a disc in @xmath1 .",
    "we will assume from now on that all curves are essential simple closed curves .",
    "two curves , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , intersecting transversely , are in _ minimal position _ if the number of their intersection points is minimal over all pairs @xmath10 , @xmath11 isotopic to @xmath8 , @xmath9 respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition that @xmath8 and @xmath9 do not form a bigon , that is , an embedded disc in @xmath1 whose boundary is a union of one arc of each of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "abusing notation , we shall also denote the isotopy class of a curve @xmath8 by @xmath8 .",
    "the intersection number , @xmath12 , is the number of intersections between representatives of the isotopy classes of @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are in minimal position .",
    "if @xmath13 is a subset of a geodesic metric space @xmath14 , we denote the closed @xmath0neighbourhood of @xmath13 in @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "we say that @xmath13 is _ @xmath0-quasiconvex _ in @xmath14 if , for any two points @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath13 , any geodesic in @xmath14 joining @xmath16 and @xmath17 is contained within @xmath15 .",
    "the metric on the curve graph , @xmath3 , is given by setting each edge to have length 1 , and we denote the distance between vertices @xmath8 and @xmath9 by @xmath18 .",

    "we shall see that for a torus boundary component @xmath1 , @xmath4 contains at most one vertex .",
    "the curve graph of the torus contains infinitely many vertices , but , with the definition given above , is not connected , since any non - isotopic curves must intersect .",
    "we instead use a standard modification and define two vertices to be adjacent if they have representative curves which intersect exactly once .",

    "we can assume that @xmath26 intersects the sphere boundary component of @xmath23 transversely in simple closed curves .",
    "repeatly performing surgeries along innermost discs to reduce the number of such curves eventually gives a disc with boundary @xmath25 which is completely contained in @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , an essential curve in @xmath1 bounds an embedded disc in @xmath2 if and only if it bounds an embedded disc in @xmath23 . in @xmath1",
    ", there is , up to isotopy , no curve other than @xmath21 which bounds an embedded disc in @xmath23 , since such a curve must be trivial in the first homology group of @xmath23 .",
    "we hence find that for any torus boundary component @xmath1 , @xmath4 is at most a single point . in this case , @xmath4 is convex in the curve graph of @xmath1 .",
