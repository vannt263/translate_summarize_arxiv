    "the developments in laser technology have opened the door to many new research areas of physics , such as molecular physics .",
    "it is a powerful tool to trigger and to analyze a bunch of dynamical processes of molecules and clusters .",
    "these processes include various dynamical situations , such as optical response @xcite , multi - photon ionization @xcite , and coulomb explosion of clusters @xcite .",
    "when the intensity of laser is comparable to molecular electronic fields , the violent excitations quickly drive the system beyond the born - oppenheimer surface resulting some new processes such as high - order harmonic generation @xcite , bond softening @xcite , charge resonance enhanced ionization @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of these mechanisms needs to solute the time - dependent schrdinger equation for all electrons and all nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "however , this kind of numerical solutions only exist for smallest systems , such as atoms @xcite , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 @xcite . for large systems",
    "the computation is quite expensive due to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , horsfield _ et al . _",
    "use correlated electron - ion dynamics to study the excitation of atomic motion by energetic electrons @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have developed a non - adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics ( na - qmd ) to study different non - adiabatic processes of different systems @xcite and calvo _ et al .",
    "_ use a combined methods to study the fragmentation of rare - gas clusters @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a fully - fledged coupled ionic and electronic dynamics is developed . at the side of the electronic dynamics , the well tested time dependent density functional theory at the level of the time - dependent local - density approximation ( tdlda )",
    "@xcite is applied .",
    "the ions are treated by classical molecular dynamics .",
    "this altogether provides a coupled tdlda - md , for a review see @xcite . up to now",
    ", it has been applied to study the dynamical scenarios of simple metal and hydrogen clusters @xcite . besides these , organic molecules are particularly interesting cases now , such as ethylene . for ethylene , recently a lot of theoretical work has been carried out to investigate either the optical response in linear domain @xcite or the dynamics of it without and with considering the external laser field @xcite .    in this paper , applying tdlda - md , we first devote to exploring the impact of ionic degrees of freedom on the excitation dynamics and we find the enhancement of the ionization with ionic motion .",
    "furthermore , we study the various excitation scenarios of ethylene as a function of laser parameters . we find that these scenarios depends sensitively on the laser parameters .",
    "it should also be noted that switching from simple metals and hydrogen clusters to organic molecules is a challenging test for the model .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section 2 provides a short presentation of the theoretical and numerical approach .",
    "section 3 first gives the ground - state properties of atoms and molecules .",
    "then the impact of ionic motion on the excitation dynamics is discussed .",
    "finally , the different excitation scenarios of ethylene as a function of the laser parameters are presented .",
    "section 4 gives conclusions .",
    "the technicalities of the model we use have been presented in detail elsewhere and for a review see @xcite . here for the sake of completeness , we recall in this section the ingredients and a few relevant formulas .    the molecule is described as a system of valence electrons and ions .",
    "valence electrons are treated by tdlda , supplemented with an average - density self - interaction correction ( adsic ) @xcite .",
    "ions are treated as classical particles .",
    "they interact via their repulsive coulomb force .",
    "pseudopotentials are used for the interaction between ions and electrons .",
    "we apply the form from @xcite .",
    "the tdlda equations are solved numerically on a grid 3d coordinate space ( cuboid box size of 72 * 72 * 64 ) with a grid spacing of @xmath2 a@xmath3 .",
    "the computation of ground state wavefunctions is determined by the damped gradient method @xcite .",
    "the time - splitting method is applied to solve the time - dependent khon - sham equation for electrons . for ions",
    "a verlet algorithm is used for their propagation under their mutual coulomb interactions together with the electron - ion forces as driven from the pseudo potential .",
    "for the nonlocal part in the pseudopotentials , it is treated as a third - order taylor expansion of the exponential @xcite .",
    "the absorbing boundary condition is employed to avoid periodic re - feeding of the emitted electrons @xcite . for the laser field , neglecting the magnetic field component , acting both on electrons and ions , can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 denoting the intensity , @xmath7 is the dipole operator , @xmath8 is the pulse profile and @xmath9 is the laser frequency . in this paper , @xmath8 is chosen as @xmath10 in time .",
    "it should be noted that this coupled ionic and electronic dynamics , constitutes a true tdlda - md , and goes beyond the usual born - oppenheimer md .",
    "it is powerful to deal with the violent off - equilibrium dynamics as induced by strong laser pulses .",
    "the capability of this technique was demonstrate earlier calculations both on metal clusters @xcite and hydrogen clusters @xcite . for organic molecules , in order to get the confidence of our approach to describe them , we first start with the ground state calculation of ethylene .",
    "here we devote to the ionization potential ( ip ) of hydrogen , carbon and ethylene .",
    "the ip which is important for dynamical calculations is computed from the energy of the last occupied electron state .",
    "in addition we calculate the bond lengths of ethylene . for the more dynamical observables we study excitation spectra of ethylene in the frequency domain which is quite useful for exploring the excitation under the laser pulse .",
    "the excitation spectra we get is quite similar to what takashi _ et al _ @xcite got . to avoid the repetition , in this paper we give the location of the lowest peak and compare it with the experimental data",
    "the ethylene , c@xmath0h@xmath11 , is the simplest organic @xmath12 system holding @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "there are 12 valence electrons . in our calculation",

    "experimental data are from the website @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 shows the ionization potentials ( ip ) of neutral atoms and c@xmath0h@xmath11 .",
    "it is obvious that the ip are reproduced well when compared with experimental values .",
    "table 2 gives more detailed results of ethylene .",
    "one can find that the relative errors are less than 4@xmath16 and the theoretical results are quite acceptable .",
    "the laser field is coupled to ethylene as a time - dependent classical field interaction simply via the dipole operator . as is discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the laser pulse is characterized by frequency , intensity and width which have their own specific influence .",
    "the frequency determines the strength of the laser - molecule coupling and the intensity determines the dynamical regime .",
    "the pulse length determines the spectral resolution and the interplay with ionic motion .",
    "thus it is painful to choose the test case in the enormous variety of conceivable laser parameters .",

    "2(a ) and ( b ) show the time evolution of ionic motion and the number of escaped electrons ( n@xmath21 ) with full ionic and with fixed ionic motion respectively .",
    "the difference between two cases is dramatic . from fig.2(a ) we can see that ions start to move at around 40 fs . four hydrogen ions move more obviously than carbon ions .",
    "electrons start to escape gradually at around 18 fs . at around 50 fs ,",
    "when the laser reaches its highest amplitude , the electron emission increases rapidly and there are almost 2.8 electrons emitted when the laser is switched off . in fig.2(b ) , when ions are kept fixed during the calculation , the trend of electronic emission in the first 40 fs is almost the same as in fig.2(a ) . however , the difference of n@xmath21 between two cases appears at around 40 fs , which is the same moment at which ions start to move . finally when the laser is switched off , about two electrons are emitted .",
    "this value is smaller than that of the moving ions case .",
    "the enhancement of the ionization for the moving ions case can be explained as in @xcite even if the studied system here is the covalent molecule .",
    "@xmath9 is in the resonant region , after increasing ionization , the optical spectrum has blue shift , so @xmath9 will be smaller than the resonant frequency .",
    "however , the coulomb force from increased net charge impels the expansion of ions which could make red shift of the optical spectrum and @xmath9 becomes in the region of resonance again .",
    "the difference of electron emission above shows the importance of treating electronic and ionic dynamics simultaneously . with the coupling of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom",

    "we consider two frequency cases here , one is @xmath25  ev ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) which is in the resonant region and the other one is @xmath22  ev ( fig.3(b ) ) which is off the resonant region . from the top to bottom panels",
    "are the time evolution of the bond lengths , of the ionic extensions along @xmath26 directions , which are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , of the dipole signal along the laser polarization , and of n@xmath21 .",
    "the polarizations of laser pulses are both along @xmath14 axis and @xmath23  w/@xmath19 . as the @xmath24  fs is rather short , after laser",
    "is switched off , we keep on following the tracks of ions and electrons until 100  fs .    from the top panel in fig .",
    "3(a ) , one can see that all of ch bond lengths start to increase slowly in parallel at around 10 fs .",
    "after the laser is switched off , they keep on increasing and start to separate from each other at around 25  fs .",
    "all of them are larger than 10  a.u . at around 60  fs .",
    "such a large bond length reflects that ch bonds are broken .",
    "the cc bond length ( solid line ) starts to change a little later than that of r@xmath30 and oscillates gently during the whole time without broken .",
    "for the ionic expansion , as is shown in the second panel in fig .",
    "3(a ) , it is obvious that ethylene expands within its plane and there is no expansion in @xmath7 direction ( dotted line ) .",
    "compare the top two panels in fig .",
    "3(b ) with corresponding panels in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we can find that for the off - resonant case , ions stay well around their initial positions .",
    "more physical insight can be gained by looking at the dipole moment as shown in the third panel in both parts .",
    "when @xmath25  ev , it has no resemblance with the laser pulse profile .",
    "the first obvious burst appears at around 10  fs .",
    "this is almost the same moment at which the bond lengths start to increase and the laser reaches its highest amplitude . at around 20  fs",
    ", when the laser is switched off , the dipole signal arrives its highest amplitude and there are many bursts .",
    "it keeps on oscillating strongly after the laser is switched off . at around 58 fs , a quick shift of",
    "the dipole signal takes place .",
    "this is due to the fact that hydrogen ions are moving towards the border of the calculation box .",
    "in contrast , for the off - resonant case , the dipole signal has almost the same profile as the laser pulse and it attains highest amplitude when the laser field reaches its highest field .",
    "after the laser is switched off it remains oscillating gently .",
    "the dipole amplitude has consequence for the direct electron emission , which is the same as in the cases of small metal clusters @xcite . a large dipole amplitude is related to the strong emission while small amplitudes cause weak emission . as we can see the electron emission in the bottom panels . in the bottom panel in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the n@xmath21 starts to increase at around 5 fs with a constant speed .",
    "this moment is a little earlier than the movement of ions since electrons are more active than ions .",
    "when the laser is switched off at 20  fs , there are almost 2.5 electrons escaped .",
    "the ionization continues but becomes much more slowly after the laser is switched off .",
    "however , at around 58  fs , ionization increases quickly again . for the electron emission in the bottom panel in fig .",
    "3(b ) , it starts to increase at around 5  fs and levels off quickly after the laser is switched off at 20  fs . the final value of n@xmath21 is much smaller than that in fig .",
    "from above discussion we can recognize that the laser frequency plays an important role in the excitation dynamics of ethylene .",
    "the frequency in the resonant region enhances the ionization leading to the coulomb fragmentation .",
    "direction and ionization of ethylene with different laser intensities .",
    "the laser polarization is along the @xmath14 direction , @xmath31  fs and @xmath22  ev.,width=302 ]    we now keep the laser frequency and the pulse length fixed and vary the laser intensity . fig .",
    "4 shows the excitation dynamics of ethylene by the laser pulses with different intensities .",
    "the @xmath9 is 6.8  ev which is off - resonant and @xmath31  fs .",
    "one can find that when intensities are low ( left panels ) , ions are almost frozen in the course of the laser pulses and electron emissions in the bottom panel are quite small .",
    "n@xmath21 values are multiplied by 1000 and 50 respectively in the bottom panel in the left part in order to compare with n@xmath21 values in the bottom panel in the right part . in the right part , for @xmath23  w/@xmath19 , ions seem to move a little at the end of the laser pulse .",
    "the dissociation of ethylene occurs when @xmath32  w/@xmath19 .",
    "ions start to move at around 10  fs with a constant velocity .",
    "it is clear that hydrogen ions move faster than carbon ions . from the right bottom panel",
    "we can see that when @xmath32  w/@xmath19 , eight to nine out of the twelve electrons are emitted in a comparatively short time .",
    "the ethylene is grossly coulomb unstable at this charge state . as a consequence ,",
    "the ionic motion exhibits clearly the pattern of a straight coulomb explosion with cc double bond and ch bonds broken as shown in the middle panel of the right part . comparing the electron emissions of different intensities",
    ", one can also find that for @xmath32 w/@xmath19 , the n@xmath21 ( dash - dotted line ) starts to increase at around 7.5  fs .",
    "this moment is earlier than not only the ionic motion but also that of other cases with lower laser intensities .",
    "the results above show that the ionization of ethylene is enhanced by the high laser intensity and the high intensity can cause coulomb explosion even if the laser frequency is in the off - resonant region .",
    "ions exhibit rigidity when laser intensities are low .",
    "fs , 40  fs , 100  fs .",
    "the laser polarizations are along @xmath14 direction and @xmath18  w/@xmath19 .",
    "the time evolution of ionic motion along the laser polarization and ionization are presented .",
    "two types of laser frequencies are given .",
    "( a ) : @xmath33  ev , ( b ) : @xmath22  ev.,width=302 ]    christov _ et al _ @xcite found that the harmonic spectrum of argon taken with 25  fs laser pulses contains harmonics up to 20 orders higher than for 100  fs laser pulses with the same intensity due in part to the nonadiabatic response of the atomic dipole to the fast rise time of the pulse . here",
    "we explore the influence of pulse lengths on the excitation of ethylene .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "we present two cases with different laser frequencies , one is in - resonant , @xmath33  ev ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) and the other one is off - resonant , @xmath22  ev ( fig .",
    "we choose the moderate peak intensity in both cases , @xmath18  w/@xmath19 . since durations are short for @xmath24  fs and 40  fs , after the laser is switched off , we keep on tracking the dynamics of electrons and ions until 60  fs and 80  fs , respectively .    in fig .",
    "5(a ) one can find that with the same intensity , when frequency is in the resonant region , no matter how long the pulse length is , ions move visibly and hydrogen ions move stronger than carbon ions .",
    "the difference lies in that for short pulse lengths , ions move gently in the course of laser pulses and the post - laser ionic motion are also gentle .",
    "however , when @xmath34  fs , after the first gentle oscillation , ethylene is dissociated with ch bonds broken before the pulse is over . therefore in this case , the pulse length actually has strong influence on the ionic motion and the long pulse length can cause fragmentation of ethylene .",
    "for the electron emission , one can read off in the bottom panel that electrons start to escape earlier than ionic motion and the ionization is enhanced by the long pulse length .",
    "this is due to the fact that with the long pulse length , active electrons absorb energy from the laser field and multielectron excitation leads to a highly excited ethylene with subsequently fragments , assisted by coulomb repulsion .    when @xmath9 is in the off - resonant region , as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the pulse length has little effect on the ionic motion .",
    "in top three panels , ions are rigid in the courses of the laser pulses .",
    "the time evolutions of n@xmath21 are shown in the bottom panel . in order to see curves",
    "clearly we multiply n@xmath21 values by 20 .",
    "it is clear that the ionization is enhanced by the long pulse length .",
    "however , for different laser pulse lengths , ionizations are quite small .",
    "furthermore , one can find that the electron emissions are saturated before the laser pulses are switched off , no matter how long the pulse length is .",
    "the independence of the excitation of ethylene on the laser pulse length here is related to the fact that the laser frequency is off - resonant and laser intensity is moderate , as a consequence , the laser pulse is not strong enough to remove electrons and there is no obvious ionic motion .",
    "we can learn from the above discussion that when the laser pulse is with moderate intensity and in - resonant frequency , the excitation dynamics of ethylene depends sensitively on the pulse length .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated the capability of tdlda - md to describe the molecular dynamics and the ionic motion really has strong effect on excitation dynamics .",
    "we have shown that this approach produces reliable basic atomic and molecular properties when compared with experimental values .",
    "we discussed various excitation scenarios of ethylene subjected to different laser pulses .",
    "these scenarios involve both electrons and ions but the relative role of each species does depend on the actual excitation conditions of the laser pulse .",
    "first , varying the laser frequency with fixed laser intensity and pulse length indicates that the appearance of deexcitation@xmath35explosion scenarios depends on the relation of the laser frequency to the eigenfrequencies of the system .",
    "second , with fixed laser frequency and pulse length , changing the laser intensity reveals that the high laser intensity leads into the the brute - force coulomb explosion of ethylene .",
    "finally , we find that with the same moderate intensity , the time scales of electronic and ionic motions depend strongly on the pulse length when laser frequency is in the resonant region .",
    "in contrast , the excitation of ethylene is much less effected by the pulse length when the laser frequency is off - resonant .",
