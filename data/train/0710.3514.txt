    "finite reflection groups are examples of finite coxeter groups .",
    "those groups show up in a natural way in geometry as symmetry groups of geometric objects , fractal geometry in the classification of simple lie algebras , in representation theory , theory of special functions and other places in analysis , cf . @xcite and the reference therein for few examples . on the other hand ,",
    "the only example we know of , where those groups have shown up in the connection with wavelet theory and multiresolution analysis is in the book by p. massopust @xcite and related construction by him and his coworkers .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 countable sets .",
    "recall , that a @xmath2-_wavelet _ is a square integrable function @xmath3 with the property that the set @xmath4 forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath5 . a special class of wavelets are the ones corresponding to _",
    "wavelet sets_. those are functions @xmath3 such that @xmath6 for a measurable subset @xmath7 of @xmath8 . the set @xmath9 is then called _ the dilation set _ and the set @xmath10 is called _ the translation set_. quite often , one assume that the dilation set is a group and that the translation set is a latices , i.e. , a discrete subgroup @xmath11 such that @xmath12 is compact . in particular , the simplest example is the group generated by one element , @xmath13 . in @xcite more general sets of dilations were considered , and in general those dilations do not form a group .",
    "even more general constructions can be found in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider the case where @xmath14 is of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an expansive matrix and @xmath17 is a finite coxeter group , see section [ section_1 ] for the definition .",
    "we use results from our previous article @xcite .",
    "those results are discussed in section [ section_2 ] .",
    "we would like to remark , that this construction is more general than needed here .",
    "in particular it is not needed that @xmath14 is a group .",
    "most of the examples of wavelet sets tend to be fractal like and symmetric around @xmath18 .",
    "our aim is to construct wavelet functions that some directional properties in the frequency domain .",
    "the finite coxeter group is then used to rotate the frequency domain to cover all of @xmath8 .",
    "some two - dimensional examples are discussed at the end of section [ section_2 ] to motivate the construction in later sections .",
    "the construction is still fractal , but it is not symmetric around @xmath18 anymore .",
    "the generalization of a rotation group for dimensions higher than two is a coxeter group .",
    "the construction is generalized to higher dimensions in section [ section_1 ] and section [ section_5 ] .",
    "a natural question one asks when working with wavelets is if they are related with any multiresolution analysis .",
    "it is well known that one needs multiwavelets when working in higher dimensions which means that the wavelets coming from the wavelets sets described above are not associated with any multiresolution analysis .    in section [ section_3 ] and section [ section_4 ]",
    "we discuss the construction of scaling sets and the associated multiresolution analysis and multiwavelets for this situation .",
    "in particular , our wavelet is still directional in the frequency domain .",
    "in fact the support of the fourier transform is supported in cones which are fundamental domains for the action of a coxeter group on the euclidian space .",
    "we are also illustrating our results with a few examples .    in the final section",
    "we discuss the relation between these results and sampling theory .",
    "any square integrable function can be written as a sum of its projections on subspaces , where each subspace contains only signals supported in the frequency domain in the cones mentioned above .",
    "each projection can then be sampled using a version of the whittaker - shannon - kotelnikov sampling theorem @xcite for spectral sets stated in theorem [ wsk ] .",
    "in this section we recall some general results from @xcite which are the basic for the construction later in this work .",
    "most of the literature deals with dilations groups generated by one element .",
    "the main idea here is to consider dilation sets that can be factorized as a product of finitely many groups ( or more general set ) and then use inductive construction to reduce the general case to the simple one .",

    "let @xmath354 be as above , @xmath355 and @xmath356 .",
    "then @xmath322 is a smra multiwavelet associated to the multiresolution @xmath357 .    as shown above",
    ", @xmath344 is a @xmath358-tile and @xmath359 and so @xmath344 is a scaling set .",
    "thus , by theorem 4.8 , @xmath322 is a smra multi - wavelet .",
    "let the group @xmath360 act on @xmath361 and let @xmath362 be the fundamental domain of this action .",
    "let @xmath363 and @xmath364\\}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath365 @xmath366@xmath367 then @xmath368 is a smra multiwavelet , see figure [ rot2 ] .",
    "let @xmath369 be a coxeter group , where @xmath224 are as described in example [ tetrahedron ] .",
    "then the fundamental domain for the action of @xmath7 on @xmath370 is @xmath371 let @xmath372 , such that @xmath343",
    ".    let @xmath373 .",
    "then @xmath374 and so there are 7 mra wavelet sets , see figure [ threedim ] .",
    "we would like to remark that the constructions in this section can easily be reduced to the case @xmath375 , where @xmath376 is the standard basis for @xmath8 .",
    "this is done by using the linear map @xmath377 .",
    "we now explain how the construction of wavelet sets mentioned in section [ section_2 ] can be done .",
    "let @xmath344 be as above and let @xmath378 .",
    "define @xmath379 @xmath380\\ ] ] @xmath381 @xmath382+\\alpha_i^{*}\\ ] ] @xmath383\\setminus w_{1,n}\\}.\\ ] ] then @xmath384 @xmath385 moreover , if we let@xmath386 then @xmath17 is a wavelet set .",
    "we have shown above that @xmath344 is a @xmath358-tile . on the other hand , @xmath387 and @xmath388",
    "so @xmath111 is a multiplicative tiling . by definition , @xmath389 and @xmath390 thus , @xmath17 is a wavelet set .",
    "in this final section we discuss how the results in section [ section_4 ] are related to sampling theory .",
    "first we note that @xmath391 thus each @xmath392 can be decomposed as @xmath393 where @xmath394 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath395 onto @xmath396 .",
    "the function @xmath397 contains the exact frequency information of @xmath395 in the direction of the cone @xmath398 .",
    "we note that @xmath399 is an open convex cone such that @xmath400 , thus the dual cone @xmath401 is an open convex cone .",
    "in fact @xmath402^*&=&\\{y\\in { \\mathbb{r}}^n\\mid ( \\forall \\lambda \\in c(w\\pi)^o)\\ , ( y,\\lambda ) > 0\\}\\\\ & = & w\\{\\sum_{i=1}^nt_j\\alpha_j\\mid t_j>0,\\ , j=1,\\ldots , n\\}\\\\ & = & w[c(\\pi ) ^o]^*\\not=\\{0\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is an open convex cone , and the function @xmath397 extends to a holomorphic function on the tube domain @xmath403 this holomorphic extension is given by @xmath404 and @xmath405 where the limit is taken in @xmath406 , see @xcite for details .",
    "thus @xmath397 is in the hardy space @xmath407 and the equations ( [ eq-6.1 ] ) and ( [ eq-6.2 ] ) give us a decomposition of @xmath395 as @xmath408-limit of @xmath409-holomorphic functions .",
    "we can then sample an approximate version of each @xmath397 ( and then @xmath395 ) using the following simple version of the whittaker - shannon - kotelnikov sampling theorem @xcite .",
    "we include a short proof using the idea of spectral sets which we have not seen elsewhere in the literature , even if it is well known .",
    "note that if the fourier transform of @xmath395 is supported in a set of finite measure , then @xmath395 is continuous so @xmath410 is well defined for all @xmath411 .",
    "( wsk - sampling theorem for spectral sets)[wsk ] let @xmath412 be measurable , @xmath413 and such that there exists a discrete set @xmath11 , such that the functions @xmath414 form a orthogonal basis for @xmath415 , i.e. , @xmath344 is similar to a spectral set .",
    "let @xmath416 then we have that for all @xmath417 , @xmath418 and @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "then @xmath421 for all @xmath422 .",
    "we have @xmath423 furthermore , as @xmath424 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath425 , @xmath426 hence @xmath427 let now @xmath422 . as @xmath428 it follows that @xmath429 .",
    "hence @xmath430 and the claim follows .",
    "we now go back to the situation in section [ section_4 ] .",
    "let @xmath201 be a system of simple roots and @xmath202 its dual basis .",
    "if we let @xmath431 , where the numbers @xmath432 are chosen so that @xmath343 , then @xmath344 is a spectral set and @xmath433 is a orthonormal basis of @xmath425 where @xmath434 .",
    "let @xmath338 be as before and @xmath357 . by theorem [ wsk ]",
