    "the rejuvenation of interest to fundamental mechanisms of energy storage in electric double - layer capacitors ( also called supercapacitors ) has been boosted by the development of novel materials for nanostructured electrodes@xcite and by a booming research in room temperature ionic liquids.@xcite this progress in material science has been accompanied by detailed investigations of performances of such systems . in particular , pioneering experimental studies  @xcite have demonstrated that using electrodes with ultranarrow pores , able to accommodate about one layer ( or row ) of ions , leads to a substantial increase of the _ surface - specific _ capacitance .",
    "this ` anomalous ' increase of capacitance for subnanometer pores can be explained by a _",
    "superionic state _ emerging in such metal - like pores :  the ion - ion interactions become exponentially screened , and this allows an easier packing of ions of the same type .",
    "an improved mean - field model has been developed that shows that the superionic state leads ultimately to higher capacitances for narrower pores .",
    "@xcite many aspects of this theory have later been verified by computer simulations.@xcite    subsequent works have focused on voltage - dependent capacitances ,  @xcite optimization of energy storage  @xcite and dynamics of charging.@xcite surprisingly , however , the structure and phase behaviour of an ionic liquid in nanoconfinement have received much less attention so far , and we know only about a voltage - induced phase transition between dilute and dense phases predicted by theory@xcite or seen in simulations.@xcite on the other hand , for flat electrodes there is experimental evidence  @xcite of hysteretic behaviour of capacitance , whose origin is not yet clear , while simulations  @xcite suggest a structural transition between _ ordered _ and disordered states in the interfacial region of an ionic liquid at flat electrodes .",
    "we shall demonstrate in this work that the ordered state should also exist in nano - confinement , show a possibility of a phase transition to a homogeneous mixture of ions ( preferable for fast charging ) , and elaborate on the structure of ionic liquids in narrow slit pores .",
    "we restrict our considerations to _ non - polarized _ pores , setting the basis for the study of voltage - dependent behaviour , which we defer to future works , however .",

    "@xcite in the context of ionic liquids and supercapacitors , examples include a lattice model for dense ionic liquids ;  @xcite a one - dimensional coulomb lattice capacitor ;  @xcite one - dimensional ising ,  @xcite blume - emery - griffiths  @xcite and harmonic oscillator  @xcite models adapted for single - file pores ; and the already mentioned continuous mean - field model for ultrathin slit pores .  @xcite    in this work we introduce a lattice model for a _ superionic liquid _ , _ i.e._an ionic liquid in the superionic state , in slit nanoconfinement .",
    "our model can be directly mapped onto the standard blume - emery - griffiths or blume - capel models ( appendix  [ app : map2beg ] ) , and is solved here using the bethe - lattice approach for bipartite lattices with coordination numbers ( numbers of the nearest neighbours ) @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( section  [ sec : bethe ] and appendix  [ sec : q4 ] , respectively ) . by definition ,",
    "the bethe lattice represents a deep interior of the so - called cayley tree ( a structure consisting of @xmath3 branches emanating from a central or root site and having @xmath4 generations , see figure  [ fig0 ] ) , discarding the effects of the boundary sites and thus describing system s bulk properties .",
    "it is important to note that as any other tree graph the bethe lattice can be partitioned into two sublattices only .",
    "@xcite for lattices that can partition into a larger number of sublattices ( _ e.g._triangular lattice , which is tripartite ) , the bethe lattice approach is not applicable and one has to resort to other approximations.@xcite    although the bethe lattice approach is unlikely to predict correct critical exponents , it has proven to give qualitatively and quantitatively accurate predictions for the location and order of phase transitions .",
    "examples of this are numerous and include athermal lattice gases ,  @xcite modulated phases of the ising model with competing interactions ,  @xcite potts models ,  @xcite lattice models of glassy systems  @xcite and localisation transitions .",
    "@xcite thus , there is a good reason to believe that the bethe - lattice approach used here will describe correctly the phase behaviour of ions in slit nanoconfinement .",
    "we supplement our analytical results by three dimensional off - lattice monte carlo simulations of an ionic liquid in ultranarrow slit pores .",
    "@xcite our simulations unravel further details in the system behaviour and reveal the structure that the ionic liquid adopts in such a strong nanoconfinement ( section  [ sec : mc ] ) .    finally , we will conclude and critically discuss our results in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider an ionic liquid ( il ) confined in a slit metallic nanopore so narrow that only one il layer can fit in it .",
    "we assume that the ions reside on the symmetry plane of this pore and consider a 2d lattice occupied by cations ( + ) , anions ( - ) or voids .",
    "the occupation of site @xmath5 can be described by a pair of boolean variables @xmath6 where the case @xmath7 is excluded because the ions can not occupy the same site due to hard core interactions .",

    "sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the strengths of the respective interactions , where @xmath14 . since the inter - ionic coulomb potential is exponentially screened in narrow metallic pores ,  @xcite we have taken into account only nearest - neighbour interactions in this work , but we note that it would be interesting to study the effects due to the next - to - nearest ( or higher ) neighbour interactions too .",
    "the electrochemical potentials of cations and anions ( in infinite dilution ) are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electrostatic potential of the pore walls measured with respect to the il bulk and @xmath17 are energies of transfer of @xmath18 ions from the pore interior into the bulk . in general case",
    "we note that @xmath20 include the ion - pore wall interactions due to the image forces ( see section  [ sec : sim : method ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : self ] ) ) , and that they are here defined such that a large positive @xmath20 corresponds to a cationo / aniono - philic pore .     throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the coupling constants , @xmath21 , do not depend on the occupation numbers @xmath22 ; we shall make a similar assumption in our monte carlo simulations as well , where we assume that the pore width does not change as the ions enter the pore ( see section  [ sec : mc ] ) .",
    "it is clear however that intrusion of sufficiently large ions into a narrow pore can create stresses on the pore and potentially expand it .",
    "@xcite this may particularly occur as a response to the applied voltage ( not studied in the present work , however ) .",
    "such ` unwanted electroactuation ' is detrimental to supercapacitors , which should ideally function without any mechanical stress,@xcite and deserves further studies .",
    "however , incorporation of such stresses into the present model would lead to serious complications , and the problem would become analytically untreatable .",
    "we shall therefore neglect such effects in our present work , and note that swelling / contraction of pores is typically of the order of a few percents,@xcite and it seems reasonable to expect that it will have only a minor effect on our results .",
    "the model defined by eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) can be mapped onto the blume - emery - griffiths model , which has been intensively studied by a large variety of methods .",
    "we discuss this mapping in appendix  [ app : map2beg ] . in the next subsection",
    ", we solve our model for @xmath23 and @xmath24 using the bethe - lattice approximation .",
    "the readers not interested in the details of our analytical approach can switch directly to subsection  [ sec : bethe : res ] , where we discuss the results and physical implications of our solution .",
    "let us consider a cayley tree ( see figure  [ fig0 ] ) with the coordination number @xmath3 ; that is , a central , root site with @xmath3 branches emanating from it and having each @xmath4 generations of sites .",
    "the partition function of our model of an ionic liquid on such a cayley tree can be represented as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an auxiliary partition function of a cayley tree with a vacant central site , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are auxiliary constrained partition functions of the model with the root site occupied by a particle + or occupied by a particle  , respectively . in what follows",
    ", we will derive general recursion relations obeyed by these auxiliary functions and then turn to the bethe - lattice solutions of these recursions .",
    "the cayley tree can be cut apart at the central site into @xmath3 identical branches .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the partition functions of one branch with initial vacant cite and the branches with initial sites occupied by particle ` @xmath33 ' or ` @xmath34 ' respectively .",
    "each branch consists of @xmath35 identical sub branches .",
    "therefore , we can write the following recursion relations for @xmath36 s : @xmath37 next , introducing new variables : @xmath38 we obtain a system of two coupled recursion relations : @xmath39 mean densities of particles ` @xmath33 ' or ` @xmath34 ' on the central site of the cayley tree can then be straightforwardly expressed via the variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42    we turn next to the behavior in the interior part of the cayley tree and the limit @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the bethe lattice , for which all sites are equivalent and hence , all @xmath44 should converge to a fixed point or cycle solutions @xmath45 .",
    "we start with the calculation of the free energy , which contains some subtleties , since the effect of the boundary sites has to be correctly excluded ( see , e.g. , discussion in ref .  ) . to this end",
    ", we use here the following procedure elaborated for generalized recursive lattices @xcite .",
    "substituting ( [ zzz ] ) into ( [ pfd ] ) and taking into account ( [ nvar ] ) we have @xmath46 so that the free energy of @xmath4-generation cayley tree can be cast into the form @xmath47 next , for @xmath31 we use first relation of ( [ recc ] ) , which gives , together with the definitions in ( [ nvar ] ) : @xmath48 rewriting the latter expression as @xmath49 and repeating this procedure @xmath50 times , we arrive at the following recursion relation obeyed by the free energy : @xmath51 where the last term is the free energy of the @xmath50-generation cayley tree @xmath52 further on , in the limit @xmath53 all @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so that @xmath56 to obtain the free energy per site , one should divide the latter expression by the number of bulk sites @xmath57 , comprising the bethe lattice , in @xmath50-generation cayley tree . according to gujrati @xcite ,",
    "@xmath58 is simply related to the number of bonds @xmath59 via the homogeneity assumption @xmath60 , and in @xmath50-generation cayley tree we have @xmath61 and hence , @xmath62    we note that similar calculations for the ising model lead to the free energy which is equivalent to the free energy obtained by the integration of the equation of state.@xcite    we focus now on the bethe lattices with the coordination numbers @xmath2 and @xmath0 in the completely symmetric case when @xmath63 and @xmath24 ( that is @xmath64 ) which is appropriate to the model of ionic liquids in non - polarised confinement ( more precisely , for potential of zero charge ) and for ions of the same size and with the same interaction with the pore walls . in this symmetric case , the original blume - emery - griffiths model reduces to a simpler blume - capel model in a magnetic field ( see appendix  [ app : map2beg ] for more details ) .",
    "we present below a detailed derivation of the results for the lattice with the coordination number @xmath65 , while the analogous derivation for the case @xmath66 , which shows the same qualitative behavior , is discussed in appendix  [ sec : q4 ] .      for @xmath2 our recursion relations in ( [ recq ] )",

    "in addition to the analytical results based on the bethe - lattice approach , we present the results of grand canonical off - lattice monte carlo simulations of an ionic liquid in a slit nanopore .",
    "before we proceed , it is necessary to emphasise the following .",
    "firstly , in the bethe - lattice approach the dimensionality of the system does not appear explicitly but enters the model only via a coordination number @xmath3 ( note that @xmath3 can be the same in different dimensions , or different for different structures in the same dimension ) . in simulations we consider a three - dimensional system , but restrict the ions to live inside slit - shaped ultra - narrow pores , which shall effectively reduce the coordination number as compared to the bulk .",
    "secondly , formulating the model on a lattice , we implicitly imposed the structure which the ionic liquid attains in the ordered or disordered state . for off - lattice systems ,",
    "the properties of the these phases are _ a priori _ unknown and the purpose of our monte carlo simulations is to understand the structure of an ionic liquid in such a strong nano - confinement .",
    "ionic liquid molecules were modelled as charged hard spheres and a pore was constructed from two parallel metal hard walls placed distance @xmath172 apart .",

    "we take a constant , pore - width independent @xmath181 , but we note that @xmath180 can in principle depend on @xmath172 and this may have a profound effect on the system behaviour ,  @xcite particularly on the dependence of the coupling constant of our lattice model , @xmath90 , on the slit width ( _ cf._figure  [ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "interaction potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) follows from the exact solution of the electrostatic problem of a point charge confined between metal walls@xcite and determines the coupling constants @xmath182 which thus depend on the pore width and ion diameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : pot ] shows @xmath183 as a function of pore width for ions located on the central symmetry plane at the closest contact .",
    "this figure suggests that in realistic systems only a first order ( discontinuous ) phase transition can potentially be observed .",
    "indeed , as shown by our bethe - lattice approach , continuous ( second - order ) transitions may take place only at low values of @xmath90 ( see figure  [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) , which do not seem to be typical for ionic liquids in nanopores .",
    "continuous transitions , however , can not in general be ruled out for other systems .     of the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) .",

    "this means that the two are related by @xmath189 , assuming that ions position themselves on the symmetry plane of the pore .",

    "although the density exhibits a similar behaviour as predicted by the theory , the transition between the dilute and dense states ( or ionophobic and ionophilic , or disordered and ` ordered ' or ` crystalline ' ) occurs rather smoothly , and we have not found sufficiently strong arguments to identify a phase transition .",
    "it is possible that this is due to the absence of true long - range order in two dimensional ` solids ' ( note however that our system is only quasi two - dimensional ) , so that the ionic liquid transforms smoothly into the locally ordered state , but remains fluidic on a larger scale , as the pore ionophilicity increases ( see also below ) . on the other hand ,",

    "the cation - cation ( and anion - anion ) rdfs show unusual two peaks ( dash red lines in figures  [ fig : mcsim : struct]a - c ) , instead of the standard single peak located between the subsequent peaks in @xmath203 .",

    "it is possible , however , that fluctuations ( and long - range interactions ) can shift this transition upwards and make it first order .",
    "@xcite for a second order transition , the total ion density and the order parameter vary continuously across the transition ; both quantities show a cusp and the quantity analogous to compressibility exhibit a finite jump at the transition ( figures  [ fig : bethe : op ] and [ fig : compres]a , respectively ) .",
    "the first order transition is predicted for @xmath90 above @xmath220 . in this case",
    ", there is a finite jump in the total ion density , order parameter and compressibility ( figures  [ fig : bethe : op ] and [ fig : compres]b ) , and the compressibility shows additionally a spike at the transition .",
    "an important observation is that by increasing the coordination number ( @xmath3 ) , the line of phase transitions between the disordered and ordered phases shifts down left , and the value of @xmath221 , below which no transition occurs , decreases with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that systems with larger coordination numbers enter into the disordered state at lower values of @xmath90 and @xmath75 , and thus at higher temperatures ( at fixed @xmath154 and @xmath138 ) .",
    "this is understandable because higher energies are required to break cation - anion ` bonds ' in the ordered state , as compared to a system with fewer such bonds , whose number increases with increasing the coordination number @xmath3 .",
    "we have realised that in realistic ionic liquids in slit nanopores , the interaction strength ( @xmath90 ) is typically of the order of a few @xmath222 or more ( figure  [ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "since the tricritical points are at rather low values of @xmath90 ( @xmath223 for @xmath2 and @xmath224 for @xmath0 ) , it seems unlikely to observe continuous transitions between the ordered and disordered states in confined ionic liquids . we may however expect to see the first order transitions , which are characterised by the discontinuity of the density at the transition , and can potentially be seen experimentally by changing temperature or pore width .",
    "interestingly , recent experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies suggest that ionophobicity of pores can be effectively controlled by using solvent .",
    "this means that such phase transitions can potentially be observed as a function of the solvent concentration .",
    "surprisingly at the first glance , our theory predicts that the transition into the disordered phase happens at negative values of the resolvation energy  @xmath138 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bethe : mu ] ) ) , which also means that a transformation from ionophilic to ionophobic occurs at @xmath225 ( unlike in simulations where it is at @xmath226 , see figure  [ fig : mcsim : density ] ) .",
    "this result can be understood as follows . for a strongly ordered phase",
    ", sub - latticing implies that each ion faces only ions of the opposite sign ( see figure  [ fig : honeycomb ] ) , and we can easily estimate the chemical potential @xmath227 . for the disordered phase and low values of @xmath138 we have @xmath228 , and we thus find that the ( first order ) transition occurs at @xmath229 .",
    "this estimate agrees remarkably well with the exact result ( figure  [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "however , our simulations show that ions have both cations and anions as their neighbours ( see figure  [ fig : mcsim : struct]d - e ) , and this shall decrease the contribution from the ion - ion interactions ( the first term in @xmath230 ) and thus increase @xmath231 .",
    "additionally , next to nearest ( and higher order ) neighbour interactions , neglected in our lattice model , will reduce the value of @xmath231 further , and may potentially bring it closer to zero ( as seen in simulations ) .",
    "it would thus be very interesting to study the effects of such long - ranged interactions on the location , order and existence of the phase transitions predicted here by the bethe - lattice approach .",
    "our monte carlo simulations support the bethe - lattice results in that they ( i ) demonstrate an abrupt drop in the ion density with an increase of ionophobicity ( compare figures  [ fig : bethe : op]b and [ fig : mcsim : density ] ) ; and ( ii ) for a dense state they show the existence of two ` sub - lattices ' of anions and cations and in - plane crystal - like ( albeit short range ) ordering of ions ( figure  [ fig : mcsim : struct ] ) . however , due to the finite size of a simulation box and limited computational resources , it has not been possible to reproduce the full ` phase diagram ' or even find sufficiently strong arguments to identify a true phase transition .",
    "further work is therefore required to verify the predictions of our lattice model .",
    "interestingly , however , the simulations reveal the formation of ordered ionic liquid clusters , separated by voids , in the region on the phase diagram where the lattice model predicts the ordered phase .",
    "such a clusterization might be a sign of the onset of a phase separation between the dense ( ordered ) and dilute ( homogeneous or disordered ) phases , and may have important consequences for charging dynamics .",
    "finally , our monte carlo simulations suggest formation of ionic ` snakes ' which lead to unusual two peaks located in close proximity of each other in the cation - cation and anion - anion radial distribution functions ( figures  [ fig : mcsim : struct]d - f ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to verify these findings experimentally , _ e.g. _  by neutron diffraction on ions using isotopic substitution ( provided of course that a large contrast with electrodes can be achieved ) , and thus to shed new lights on the structure and phase behaviour of ionic liquids in such strong nanoconfinements .",
    "since the hard - core interaction excludes the state @xmath232 for the same site , there is a well - known connection between the present model and the three - state lattice gas model @xcite or , equivalently , a special blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) spin @xmath233 model @xcite .",
    "the mapping to the beg model is accomplished as follows .",
    "we assign , in a usual fashion , to each site a three - state variable @xmath234 , such that @xmath235 then , the occupation numbers @xmath236 and @xmath237 may be straightforwardly rewritten in terms of @xmath234 as @xmath238 so that the hamiltonian becomes @xmath239 where @xmath240 as one can readily notice , @xmath241 , since all interactions strengths @xmath154 are positive in our case .",
    "note that such model with @xmath241 was already applied to describe crystallization and the order - disorder transition in a binary alloy within a mean - field approximation@xcite .    in case of equal interaction strengths between the like species , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath242 , the constant @xmath243 in ( [ beg ] ) becomes equal to zero , @xmath244 , so that the model reduces to a well - studied version of the original beg model .",
    "it was treated by a wide variety of approaches ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) and has a rich phase diagram including paramagnetic , ferromagnetic , quadrupolar phases , and multicritical points , depending on the ratio of @xmath245 .",
    "note that the ferromagnetic case @xmath246 was mainly studied for bipartite lattices since in the absence of an external field ( @xmath247 ) one can map the antiferromagnetic case @xmath241 onto the ferromagnetic case by merely redefining the spin directions on one of the sublattices .",
    "note that in ionic liquids ions are single charged in the vast majority of cases .",
    "therefore , the choice @xmath242 is absolutely `` natural '' , given that the ionic valencies are equal .",
    "physically , for the systems with coulomb interactions , when @xmath242 , assuming also that the ions of both types have approximately the same size , one should expect that @xmath248 .",
    "this leads to @xmath249 , and thereby to the so - called spin-1 blume - capel ( bc ) model in a magnetic field .",
    "this model was originally invented to describe magnetic systems @xcite and has been subsequently applied to a large variety of physical problems ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the original mean - field treatments @xcite were continued @xcite and completed by various analytical and numerical studies of two - dimensional and tree - dimensional bc models @xcite .",
    "we note that already a mean - field analysis presented in the seminal works @xcite showed that the bc spin-1 model exhibits a second - order phase transition line separating a disordered phase from an ordered one , and changing at a tricritical point into the line of the first - order phase transitions for sufficiently large values of @xmath250 .",
    "the phase diagram , location of the tricritical point , as well as values of the critical exponents were quantitatively analysed within high- @xcite , and low - temperature series expansion methods @xcite , different effective theories @xcite , variational approximations @xcite , mean - field renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite , kadanoff s lower - bound rg transformations @xcite , nonperturbative rg schemes @xcite , various monte - carlo methods @xcite , constant - coupling approximation @xcite , transfer matrix finite - size scaling@xcite , lowest approximation of cluster variation method @xcite , and pair approximations for the free energy @xcite .",
    "we note finally that the bc model has also been studied using the bethe lattice approximation .",
    "the first exact results for the bc model on the bethe lattice with a general coordination number @xmath3 were obtained within the beg model @xcite . analysing fixed points of exact recurrent equations ,",
    "the specific features of the transition between the paramagnetic and the nferromagnetic phases , as well as the existence of the tricritical point were investigated . as was noted in ref .",
    ", these studies did not take into account a bipartite nature of the bethe lattice .",

    "correlation functions for the beg model on bethe lattice were obtained in refs .  .",
    "numerical analysis of fixed points and cycles solutions of exact recursion relations were performed in refs .  .",
