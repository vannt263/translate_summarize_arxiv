    "optical techniques based on the magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) , such as time - resolved moke ( tr - moke ) or brillouin light scattering ( bls ) spectroscopy are routinely used for the investigation of magnetization dynamics . whereas tr - moke provides information on the magnetization dynamics within the time domain , bls informs on magnetization dynamics within the frequency domain .",
    "bls measures light intensity scattered by a spin wave . in a  phenomenological ( wave ) picture",
    "a  spin wave is a periodical displacement of the magnetization with respect to the saturated state , oscillating at a  spin - wave frequency @xmath0 , and propagating at a given spin - wave @xmath1-vector .",
    "the spin waves result from the coupling between the spins , dominated by exchange and dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "any periodical variation of the optical properties ( namely , periodic variation of the permittivity tensor @xmath2 ) works as an effective oscillating and propagating optical grating @xcite .",
    "hence , due to the spatial periodicity of the effective grating , the reflected light is scattered and changes its propagation direction .",
    "furthermore , the oscillation of the effective grating changes the light frequency of the scattered light , a quantity detected in a bls spectrometer @xcite . in a ( pseudo-)particle picture ,",
    "the scattering of the light by the spin wave can be interpreted as inelastic scattering of photons on magnons @xcite , where the photon is gaining ( loosing ) its energy as it absorbes ( creates ) a magnon , respectively .",
    "therefore , in contrast to tr - moke , bls can also detect non - coherent spin waves such as thermal spin waves .",
    "note , that the bls technique usually provides a larger experimental sensitivity when compared to the tr - moke technique .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated to detect thermal spin waves on a co monolayer @xcite .",
    "tr - moke investigations are based on repeated excitations of magnetization dynamics , usually by magnetic field pulses or by intense light pulses @xcite .",
    "the resulting excitations are then stroboscopically detected making use of the moke .",
    "therefore , tr - moke provides an insight into the magnetization dynamics within the time domain . using fourier transformation ,",
    "the tr - moke signal can be easily transformed to the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "hence , in case of externally excited systems , tr - moke and bls investigations are complementary .",
    "this was nicely demonstrated by k.  perzlmaier _ et al _ investigating confined spin - wave modes in a square permalloy element @xcite .",
    "the numerical models to calculate the bls light intensity were elaborated by j.r .",
    "cochran _ et al _ @xcite , followed by l.  giovannini _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "later , a  simple relation between the complex kerr angle and the bls intensity was expressed by m.  buchmeier _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "however , all those treatments of the bls intensity are numerical ones , and up to now , there exists no analytical expression of the moke and bls signals originating from spin - wave modes .    within this article , we present the analytical dependence of the tr - moke and bls signals for several types of spin - wave modes .",
    "such calculations can serve either for separation of moke and bls signals from a single ferromagnetic ( fm ) material in a stack of fm layers @xcite , or for the quantitative determination of the energy carried by each spin - wave mode .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we establish a relation between the bls intensity and strength of the moke effect . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] the analytical expression of the moke depth sensitivity function is developed , and we discuss its validity and properties .",
    "section  [ sec : iv ] provides the analytical expressions of the moke and bls signals .",
    "finally section  [ sec : v ] compares analytical expressions with optically exact numerical models , and we discuss in detail the fm - layer thickness dependence of the moke and bls signals .",
    "as the light travels through the fm layer , the light intensity is attenuated and the phase of the light is delayed .",
    "therefore , sublayers of the fm material situated at different depths of the fm layer provide a different moke response to a given magnetization state . due to the fact that the moke is linear in magnetization , the result can be written as a superposition of the single contributions coming from the different depths of the fm layer @xcite : @xmath3 \\mathrm{d}z=\\phi_{{\\mathtt{s}}/{\\mathtt{p } } } \\sin({\\omega_\\mathrm{sw}}t + \\phi_{{\\mathtt{s}}/{\\mathtt{p}}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the @xmath6- and @xmath7- complex kerr angles , arising from the fm film when the incident light is @xmath6 and @xmath7 polarized , respectively .",
    "the terms @xmath8 , @xmath9 stand for components of the reflection matrix . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the complex moke depth sensitivity functions related to longitudinal and polar magnetization , respectively , @xmath12 being the fm layer thickness . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the depth profiles of the magnetizations in the fm film having longitudinal ( i.e.  in - plane and parallel to the plane of the light incidence ) and polar ( i.e.  normal ) directions . in the case of spin waves ,",
    "those magnetizations correspond to profiles of the dynamic magnetization ( i.e.  spin - wave amplitudes ) , precessing at the frequency @xmath0 , @xmath15    according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the bls intensity @xmath16 of the backscattered light can be expressed in a rather similar way as the complex kerr angle @xmath17 : @xmath18 \\mathrm{d}z \\right|^2.\\ ] ] within the depth sensitivity , the main difference between the complex kerr angle @xmath17 and the bls intensity @xmath16 is given by the fact that whereas moke is a linear combination of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the magnetization profiles @xmath21 , @xmath22 , respectively , the bls intensity has a quadratic form .    from comparing the equations expressing the complex kerr angle ( eq .",
    "[ eq : phimode ] ) and the bls intensity ( eq .  [ eq : bls ] ) , their close similarity is apparent . with exception of the sign of the longitudinal contribution ,",
    "the bls intensity is basically a  quadratic form of moke .",
    "therefore , the bls intensity can be expressed as being proportional to the square of the off - diagonal reflection coefficients @xmath23 @xmath24 where we must reverse the sign of the longitudinal contribution when expressing @xmath25 .",
    "for example , this can be achieved either by reversing the sign of @xmath26 in the calculations . the complex kerr angle ( i.e.  the magnitude of the moke )",
    "is denoted by @xmath25 , neglecting its time dependence ( i.e.   omitting the term @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phimode ] ) ) .",
    "in the case of an optically thick fm layer ( i.e.  the fm film thickness @xmath12 is larger than the moke probing depth @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the vacuum light wavelength and @xmath30 defined just below ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be analytically expressed as @xcite @xmath31 \\\\ \\label{eq : dsl } l_{{\\mathtt{s}}/{\\mathtt{p}}}(z)&=l_{{\\mathtt{s}}/{\\mathtt{p}}}(0 ) \\exp[-4\\pi i n_z z/\\lambda],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath32 to be the ratio of the lmoke and pmoke response at the upper interface ( i.e.  @xmath33 ) of the fm layer , @xmath34 , @xmath30 is the normalized wave - vector of light in polar ( i.e.  normal ) direction , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the refractive indices of the fm layer and air , respectively , and @xmath38 is the angle of light incidence with respect to the sample normal , respectively . in general , metals provide a relatively large value of the optical permeability @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the refractive index .",
    "therefore , the angular dependence of @xmath30 can be neglected and hence @xmath41 . for example , for ni at @xmath42 nm , @xmath43 and hence @xmath30 is reduced only by 1% when going from @xmath44 to 90@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "an example of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : moke](a ) for the multilayer structure air / cu(2nm)/ni(60nm)/cu(5nm)/si .",
    "the calculations were done using a  @xmath46 matrix formalism @xcite , for a  light wavelength of @xmath42 nm and an incidence angle of @xmath47 .",
    "the diagonal permittivity of the used materials are @xmath48 , @xmath43 , @xmath49 , the off - diagonal permittivity of ni being @xmath50 @xcite . as the difference between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) is only the starting amplitude and phase of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the calculations in fig .",
    "[ f : moke](a ) are presented only for @xmath51 and @xmath53 . in this particular case , the polar moke ( pmoke ) amplitude is about 12@xmath57 larger than the longitudinal moke ( lmoke ) amplitude .",
    "it can be considered a general rule that the pmoke is stronger than the lmoke .",
    "additionally , in our example , also the small incidence angle of @xmath47 contributes to the small value of the lmoke ( lmoke vanishes at @xmath44 ) .",
    "but even for an incidence angle of about 60 - 70@xmath45 , when the lmoke reaches its maximum , its amplitude would increase only by a factor of 2 , still much smaller than the pmoke .",
    "figure  [ f : moke](b ) shows an agreement between the analytical expressions of the moke depth sensitivity functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dsp][eq : dsl ] ) and as determined from optically exact @xmath58 matrix calculations for various ni thicknesses .",
    "the starting point , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is determined by the optical @xmath594 calculations in both cases .",
    "it is demonstrated that there is nearly a  perfect agreement for large ni thicknesses 40 and 60 nm , whereas there is a disagreement for ni thicknesses below 30 nm .",
    "it is because the analytical expressions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are valid when the thickness of the fm layer @xmath12 is larger than the moke probing length , @xmath28 ( @xmath60 nm for ni at @xmath42 nm ) . on the other hand , for very small thicknesses of the fm layer ( when @xmath61 , i.e.  below @xmath62 nm )",
    ", the fm layer can be neglected from the optical point of view .",
    "hence , @xmath20 , @xmath19 can be considered constant so that the expressions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 are also valid for a very small thicknesses of the fm layer ( so - called ultrathin fm layer approximation @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the moke depth sensitivity functions @xmath20 , @xmath19 are described well by the analytical expressions ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dsp][eq : dsl ] ) ) with exception of the fm thickness range between about 3 nm to 30 nm .",
    "however , even in this range , the analytical expression describes basic features of the depth sensitivity functions .",
    "namely a reduction of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and an increase of the phase @xmath65 , @xmath66 with increasing depth inside fm film .",
    "hence , deviation of the simple analytical calculations from an optically exact calculations is not large even in case of this thickness interval , as shown later .",
    "we finally note that @xmath10 , @xmath11 are nearly independent of the incidence angle as their angular dependence is governed solely by @xmath30 , whose angular dependence is very weak in the general case of metals .",
    "to obtain the moke or bls response of a given spin - wave mode , the profile of the dynamic magnetizations @xmath21 , @xmath22 through the fm film must be determined first .",
    "those calculations are usually based on phenomenological models of the magnetization inside the fm layer @xcite .",

    "the underlying physics is that the upper part of the fm layer , which is probed by light , has nearly constant amplitude of the dynamic magnetization .",
