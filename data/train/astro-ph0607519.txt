    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) consist of the stellar mass lost by their low- or intermediate - mass stellar progenitors during late evolutionary stages . as",
    "a star evolves past the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , the mass loss process changes from a copious slow agb wind to a tenuous fast wind and the interaction between the fast wind and the agb wind forms a pn @xcite . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that this wind - wind interaction can produce the commonly observed elliptical and bipolar morphologies of pne , although the bipolar morphology requires that either the agb wind or the fast stellar wind is anisotropic and has a polar angle dependence .",
    "the geometry of the fast wind has often been assumed to be isotropic , but the presence of bipolar jets and collimated outflows in some pne indicates that the fast wind may span a range of geometries . for wind velocities greater than @xmath1300  km  s@xmath2 ,",
    "the interaction of the fast stellar wind with the agb wind will shock - heat the wind material to temperatures greater than 10@xmath3  k. this shocked fast stellar wind is too tenuous to produce appreciable x - ray emission , but at its interface with the dense nebular material , heat conduction lowers the temperature and mass evaporation raises the density of the shocked fast wind , producing optimal conditions for x - ray emission @xcite . since the hot gas in a pn",
    "is associated with shocked fast wind , the distribution of x - ray emission may be used to infer a directional dependence for the fast wind .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of elliptical pne have revealed diffuse x - ray emission confined within their innermost nebular shells , e.g. , ngc2392 @xcite and ngc6543 @xcite .",
    "the plasma temperatures implied by their x - ray spectra are a few times @xmath4  k. in the case of ngc6543 , the x - ray emission is well resolved , and a clear limb - brightening is observed .",
    "of the ten elliptical pne observed by either _",
    "xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ , six show detectable diffuse x - ray emission @xcite .    _ chandra _ has observed many bipolar pne . while two of them , mz3 and ngc7027 , exhibit diffuse x - ray emission confined within the bipolar lobes @xcite , the other bipolar pne ( e.g. , mycn18 , m1 - 16 , m1 - 92 , m2 - 9 , oh231.8 + 4.2 ) were not detected .",
    "most of these non - detections are understandable because they are associated with relatively young / exotic bipolar pne that either have large circumstellar absorption or have collimated outflows with low wind / outflow velocities , @xmath5300  km  s@xmath2 . in order to better characterize diffuse x - ray emission from bipolar pne ,",
    "we have used _ xmm - newton _ to observe two carefully chosen bipolar pne with contrasting lobe morphologies , ngc2346 and ngc7026 .",
    "ngc2346 has a butterfly morphology with two open bipolar lobes and a bright equatorial waist that contains large amounts of molecular gas and dust @xcite .",
    "its central star is a white dwarf with an a5 companion @xcite , forming a single - line spectroscopic binary with a period of @xmath116 days @xcite .",
    "its nebular gas shows a bipolar velocity field with a dynamic age of 3,5004,700 yrs @xcite .",
    "ngc2346 can be described as an evolved bipolar pn .",
    "ngc7026 has closed bipolar lobes emanating from a bright ring - like waist @xcite , and the lobes appear to have multiple components @xcite .",
    "its central star is a hydrogen - deficient wc star @xcite .",
    "the dynamic age derived from the nebular expansion , @xmath51,000 yrs , suggests that ngc7026 is a young bipolar pn @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations of these two pne have detected diffuse x - ray emission from ngc7026 , but not from ngc2346 . in this paper",
    ", we describe these x - ray observations and their reduction in  2 , report our analysis of the observations in  3 , and discuss their implications in  4 .",
    "ngc2346 and ngc7026 were observed with _ xmm - newton _ in revolution 876 ( obs i d 0200240501 ) on 2004 september 20 and revolution 825 ( obs i d 0200240101 ) on 2004 june 10 , respectively .",
    "the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) , which consists of two mos and one pn ccd arrays , was used with a medium filter .",
    "the two epic / mos cameras were operated in the full - frame mode for a total exposure time of 16.5 ks for ngc2346 and 19.2 ks for ngc7026 .",
    "the epic / pn camera was operated in the extended full - frame mode for a total exposure time of 11.1 ks for ngc2346 and 14.1 ks for ngc7026 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ pipeline products have been processed using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas version 6.1.0 ) and the calibration files from the calibration access layer available on 2005 april 22 .",
    "the event files have been screened to eliminate bad events and periods of high background . for the epic / mos observations , only events with ccd patterns 012 ( similar to @xmath6 grades 04 )",
    "were selected ; for the epic / pn observation , only events with ccd pattern 0 ( single pixel events ) were selected . to assess the background rate",
    ", we obtained light curves for each instrument in the 1012 kev energy range , where the counts are dominated by the background .",
    "the time intervals with high background , i.e. , count rates @xmath7 cnts  s@xmath2 for the epic / mos or @xmath8 cnts  s@xmath2 for the epic / pn , were discarded .",
    "the resulting exposure times for the epic / mos and epic / pn observations were 16.5 ks and 10.9 ks for ngc2346 and 15.5 ks and 13.3 ks for ngc7026 , respectively .",
    "x - ray emission was clearly detected from ngc7026 but not from ngc2346 .",
    "we therefore describe the results from ngc7026 first and then determine an upper limit for the x - ray luminosity of ngc2346 .",
    "to measure the faint x - ray emission from ngc7026 , we used a @xmath9 elliptical source aperture that encompasses the entire optical nebula and a background aperture @xmath15 times as large as the source aperture located at a similar y - coordinate of the detector .",
    "the epic / pn observation detected a total of @xmath10 background - subtracted counts , corresponding to a count rate of 8.3@xmath1110@xmath12 cnts  s@xmath2 .",
    "the epic / mos1 and epic / mos2 observations detected @xmath13 and @xmath14 background - subtracted counts , corresponding to count rates of 1.7@xmath1110@xmath12 cnts  s@xmath2 and 2.0@xmath1110@xmath12 cnts  s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we have merged the epic / pn and epic / mos images to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the merged epic image is displayed in figure  1a and a smoothed image in figure  1b .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is clearly detected . in order to compare the distribution of x - ray emission with the optical nebula ,",
    "accurate alignment between x - ray and optical images is essential .",
    "we have determined the astrometric solution for the epic image with an accuracy of @xmath105 , based on stellar sources that are detected in both this x - ray image and the _ digitized sky survey_. the relative alignment of the epic image and a nordic optical telescope ( not ) [ ] image in figure  1c is accurate to @xmath106 .",
    "the distribution of diffuse x - ray emission from ngc7026 is elongated in the north - south direction , matching the polar axis of the nebula .",
    "the position and orientation of the 50% contour of the smoothed epic image follow the bipolar lobes shown in the not [ n  ii ] image ( fig .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray emission shows two peaks that are projected within the bipolar lobes north and south of the central waist of ngc7026 .",
    "these excellent correspondences suggest that the diffuse x - ray emission from ngc7026 is all confined within its bipolar lobes , similar to what is seen in the bipolar pn mz3 @xcite .",
    "we have simulated the surface brightness of diffuse x - ray emission assuming the hot gas is distributed in two spherical shells with fractional shell thickness ( @xmath15 ) of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , and 1.0 .",
    "we find that the small number of counts and limited angular resolution precludes even a rough estimate of the geometry .",
    "similarly , we can not determine whether the local minimum along the waist is caused by higher circumstellar absorption .",
    "x - ray spectra of ngc7026 have been extracted from the event files of the three _ xmm - newton _ epic cameras using the same source and background apertures described in  3.1 . due to the limited number of counts detected by the epic / mos observations , we will limit the spectral analysis to the epic / pn spectrum shown in figure  2 .",
    "this spectrum is soft , peaking at @xmath16 kev with a nearly flat distribution from 0.2 to 0.4 kev .",
    "emission between 0.7 and 1.1 kev is detected but with low s / n ratio .",
    "there is no detectable emission at energies greater than 1.25 kev .",
    "the epic / pn spectrum of ngc7026 , similar to other pne , is suggestive of thermal plasma emission with its broad peak at @xmath10.5 kev corresponding to emission from the he - like triplets of n  vi at @xmath10.43 kev and o  vii at @xmath17 kev . in order to model this x - ray spectrum ,",
    "we have adopted the mekal thin plasma emission model @xcite .",
    "spectral fits were carried out by folding the thin plasma emission model spectrum through the epic / pn response matrix , and comparing the modeled spectrum to the observed epic / pn spectrum in the 0.251.5 kev energy range after the spectrum was resampled to energy bins with at least 16 counts .",
    "the best - fit was judged based on the @xmath18 statistics .",
    "it was found that the spectral fits did not accurately constrain the absorption column density , @xmath19 , if it was allowed to vary as a free parameter .",
    "we therefore held @xmath19 fixed at 3.2@xmath1110@xmath20  @xmath21 , estimated from the observed logarithmic extinction in the h@xmath22 line @xmath23 @xcite and the canonical gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath24  atoms  @xmath21  mag@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray - emitting gas consists of shocked fast wind and mixed - in nebular gas . as the wind abundances determined from uv spectroscopic observations",
    "@xcite differ from the nebular abundances determined from optical spectra @xcite , we have made spectral fits using wind or nebular abundances separately .",
    "the first spectral fits use the nebular abundances , with the number ratio of he , o , n , ne , ar , cl , and s to hydrogen being 0.14 , 7.3@xmath1110@xmath25 , 5.5@xmath1110@xmath25 , 1.8@xmath1110@xmath25 , 3.1@xmath1110@xmath26 , 3.7@xmath1110@xmath27 , and 1.4@xmath1110@xmath28 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the corresponding nebular abundances of these elements relative to the solar values @xcite are 1.43 , 0.86 , 4.9 , 1.8 , 1.5 , 2.0 , and 0.96 , respectively .",
    "solar abundances are used for the other elements , which have low abundances and are not expected to contribute significantly to the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "we have also assumed solar abundances for the foreground interstellar absorption , and adopted absorption cross - sections from @xcite . the resulting best - fit model with nebular abundances and a fixed @xmath19 is overplotted on the epic / pn spectrum in figure  2a .",
    "the plasma temperature of the best - fit model is @xmath29 k ( i.e. , @xmath30 = 0.095@xmath31 kev ) .",
    "the second spectral fits use stellar abundances .",
    "the central star of ngc7026 has been classified as a hydrogen - deficient wc star with the mass - fractions of he , c , and o being 70 , 20 , and 10% , respectively @xcite . in order to make spectral fits using a mekal model",
    "we have assumed a he / h ratio of 200 and scaled the abundances of c and o according to their mass fractions .",
    "thus , the values adopted for the stellar wind abundances relative to the solar values were 20 , 500 , and 80 for he , c , and o , respectively .",
    "all other abundances were set to zero and the absorption column density , @xmath19 , was again held fixed with a value of 3.2@xmath1110@xmath20  @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting best - fit model is shown in figure  2b .",
    "this model with stellar abundances has roughly the same temperature as the best - fit using nebular abundances and a slightly higher reduced @xmath18 .",
    "the most obvious difference between the best - fit models using nebular and stellar abundances is that the model with stellar abundances underestimates the emission at @xmath10.5  kev due to the absence of n in the stellar chemical composition .",
    "clearly the quality of both spectral fits are limited by the relatively small number of counts in the x - ray spectrum and it is not possible to convincingly distinguish whether the chemical composition of the x - ray emitting gas in ngc7026 better matches that of the central star or the nebula .",
    "from the epic / pn spectrum we can also determine that the volume emission measure is @xmath32 cm@xmath12 , where @xmath34 is the distance to ngc7026 in pc .",
    "the distance has been estimated to be 1700@xmath35 pc based on the extinction to ngc7026 @xcite and on the extinction - distance relationship derived by @xcite .",
    "the observed ( absorbed ) x - ray flux of ngc7026 in the 0.22.5 kev energy range is @xmath36 ergs  @xmath21  s@xmath2 , and the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) x - ray flux is @xmath37 ergs  @xmath21  s@xmath2 .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity in the 0.22.5 kev energy range is @xmath38 ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc2346 are compared with a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 [ n  ii ] image in figure  3 .",
    "there is no statistically significant x - ray emission associated with either the nebula or the central star in these observations .",
    "the epic / pn observations have been used to derive an upper limit for its x - ray luminosity using a source aperture encompassing the optical nebula .",
    "the 3@xmath39 upper limit for the epic / pn count rate in the 0.3 - 1.25 kev band is 4.5@xmath1110@xmath12 cnts  s@xmath2 . to derive an upper limit of the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) flux we assume a thin plasma emission model with similar temperature and nebular abundances to the one that describes the x - ray emission from ngc7026 ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the foreground absorption is estimated based on the observed logarithmic extinction at the h@xmath22 line , c(h@xmath22)=0.75 @xcite , which corresponds to a column density of @xmath19=3.0@xmath1110@xmath20 @xmath21 . at a distance to ngc2346 of 690 pc @xcite ,",
    "the 3-@xmath39 upper limit of the unabsorbed flux corresponds to an x - ray luminosity @xmath54@xmath1110@xmath40 ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc7026 clearly show diffuse x - ray emission while the observations of ngc2346 do not detect significant x - ray emission .",
    "we will now use these observations to discuss the production and evolution of hot gas in bipolar pne .",
    "the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission in ngc7026 suggests that the x - ray - emitting gas is confined within the bipolar lobes , but its spatial distribution is unknown .",
    "therefore , we define the hot gas filling factor , @xmath41 , as the ratio of the emitting volume to the total nebular volume and use a reference value of 0.5 in our analysis . using the volume emission measure determined from the spectral fits ( in  3.2 ) and approximating the emitting volume by a 40@xmath42@xmath1115@xmath42@xmath1115@xmath42 rectangular box , the rms electron density is @xmath43 cm@xmath12 .",
    "this density and the best - fit plasma temperature can in turn be used to derive the thermal pressure of the hot gas , @xmath44 dynes  @xmath21 , assuming h and he are fully ionized and that the number ratio of he / h is 0.14 ( the nebular abundance ) .",
    "we can compare this hot gas pressure to the thermal pressure of the warm nebular shell of ngc7026 to see whether the nebular expansion is driven by the thermal pressure as expected by the @xcite model .",
    "the electron density and temperature reported by @xcite are generally lower than those reported by @xcite .",
    "the lowest temperature and density are derived from the [ ] lines , 6,400 k and 3,300 cm@xmath12 @xcite , resulting in a thermal pressure of @xmath45 dynes  @xmath21 .",
    "the temperatures and densities derived from a variety of lines by @xcite are @xmath46 k and @xmath47 cm@xmath12 , resulting in a thermal pressure of @xmath48 dynes  @xmath21 .",
    "these measurements were made at the bright nebular waist , where the density is expected to be the highest . while the thermal pressure of the nebular gas is higher than that of the hot gas in the waist region , it is likely that the pressure of the nebular gas in the lobes is comparable to that of the hot gas .",
    "ngc2346 is a larger and more evolved bipolar pn than ngc7026 .",
    "no fast wind from the central star of ngc2346 has been detected , as the _ iue _ observations of the stellar and lines do not show pcygni profiles @xcite .",
    "if the central star of ngc2346 had a fast stellar wind in the past , the hot gas resulting from the shocked fast wind has either cooled or is too rarefied to be detected .",
    "while the presence of a strong fast stellar wind is a prerequisite for the production of detectable diffuse x - ray emission , the lobe structure of bipolar pne may also play an essential role .",
    "ngc2346 has an open - lobe structure and lacks detectable diffuse x - ray emission and ngc7026 has a closed - lobe structure and detectable x - ray emission .",
    "previous x - ray observations of bipolar pne have detected only two other nebulae , ngc7027 and mz3 , and both have closed - lobe structures .",
    "it is possible that open lobes allow shocked - wind to be distributed to a larger volume and the lower density precludes the detection of x - ray emission . in the case of ngc2346 ,",
    "hot gas is not produced currently because of a lack of fast stellar wind . even if it had a fast wind in the recent past , its open lobes were not able to retain the shocked stellar wind to prolong the detectability of its diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray emission is not detected from the central star of either ngc2346 or ngc7026 .",
    "the central star of ngc2346 is a hot white dwarf with an a5 companion .",
    "a hot white dwarf s photospheric emission can reach the soft x - ray energy range , but is easily absorbed by the nebular gas or foreground interstellar material .",
    "a - type stars have neither fast stellar winds nor active coronae , and therefore are not expected to be x - ray sources .",
    "even if the white dwarf possesses an accretion disk , the temperature of the accretion disk can not be high enough to produce x - ray emission .",
    "ngc7026 has a wc - type central star .",
    "no x - ray emission has ever been detected from a single wc star even among the massive wolf - rayet stars @xcite because of the high opacity in their stellar atmospheres .      to date",
    ", only three bipolar pne have been detected in x - rays . among these",
    ", mz3 has a symbiotic central star and its x - ray emission appears to originate from interactions between its bipolar jets and the nebular material @xcite .",
    "the other two , ngc7026 and ngc7027 , are bona fide bipolar pne .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ngc7026 is one of the highest among all pne detected in x - rays .",
    "its hot gas mass , @xmath10.002 @xmath49 , is also high compared to other pne .",
    "note however that these values may be overestimated because the x - ray - emitting lobes may have lower circum - nebular absorption than the waist region where the extinction was measured .",
    "the young bipolar pn ngc7027 has a lower x - ray luminosity and smaller hot gas mass , but a higher hot gas temperature and density @xcite .",
    "the differences between ngc7026 and ngc7027 might be due to an evolutionary effect , but more positive x - ray detections of bipolar pne of intermediate ages are needed to investigate the properties and evolution of their hot gas .",
    "_ chandra _ has observed five other bipolar pne but none were detected .",
    "based on these non - detections we suggest that future x - ray observations of bipolar pne should avoid objects that have open bipolar lobes and objects with low velocity outflows ( @xmath5300  km  s@xmath2 ) . instead , observations of objects with closed bipolar lobes , to confine hot gas , and with kinematic ages of no more than a few thousand years would appear best suited for understanding the generation and evolution of hot gas in bipolar pne .    this research was supported by the nasa grant nng04ge63 g . m.a.g . acknowledges support from the grants aya  2002 - 00376 and aya  2005 - 01495 of the spanish mec ( cofunded by feder funds ) and the spanish program ramn y cajal ."
