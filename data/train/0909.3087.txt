    "extinction curves are one of the cornerstones of our understanding of dust in interstellar space .",
    "extinction curves probe the sum of the absorption and scattering of dust and their determination is observationally straightforward .",
    "most extinction curves are measured using the standard pair method @xcite where the measurements of a reddened star are ratioed to those of an unreddened star of the same spectral type .",
    "the importance of measuring extinction curves over the widest wavelength range possible is attested to by their use as a fundamental constraint in models of dust grains @xcite .",
    "measuring extinction curves is also important for purely empirical reasons in order to allow for the proper accounting for the effects of interstellar dust in the study of astrophysical objects .",
    "structure in interstellar extinction curves gives direct evidence of the dust grain compositions . in the ultraviolet ,",
    "the one very obvious discrete feature is the 2175    extinction bump @xcite .",
    "the 2175    bump has been observed to have nearly constant central wavelength , a width varying from 280660    @xcite , and has been attributed to small graphite grains @xcite .",
    "there have been no other discrete features found in the ultraviolet with fairly sensitive limits placed from searches @xcite for counterparts of the optical / near - infrared diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other main structure seen in the ultraviolet extinction curve is the far - ultraviolet ( far - uv ) rise .",
    "this rise is characterized by a constant shape between 1700 and 1175  @xcite and has been modeled as the wing of a feature like the 2175    bump , but centered at 715    @xcite .    the structure in the ultraviolet between 1175 and 3300",
    "  has been well studied using spectra taken with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) @xcite and the space telescope spectrograph on the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "the structure in this wavelength range is well approximated by the @xcite ( hereafter fm90 ) parameterization with the curve being the combination of a linear term , a drude profile , and a cubic describing the far - uv rise .",
    "in addition , the average behavior of ultraviolet extinction was found by @xcite ( hereafter ccm89 ) to correlate with @xmath16 ( a rough measure of the average dust grain size ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have proposed a revised parameterization that includes an additional parameter and simplifies the far - uv curvature term to just a quadratic .",

    "the many spectra of hot stars taken with the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite will study the correlations between the gas properties ( e.g. , @xmath0 , & ) and dust extinction .",
    "the sample of stars for this paper was determined by searching the fuse archive for stars from the @xcite ( hereafter vgc04 ) sample of iue extinction curves that had good quality fuse spectra .",
    "iue extinction curves are required because the large scale extinction structure in the fuse wavelength range ( far - uv rise ) starts in the iue spectral range around 1700    @xcite . as a side benefit ,",
    "the existence of iue extinction curves for all the sightlines studied in this paper ensures that these sightlines are suitable for extinction curve determinations .",
    "the final sample for this paper includes 75 sightlines .",
    "the fuse observations ( 912  1190   ) were extracted from the archive and reduced using calfuse v3.0 .",
    "the observations used for each star are given in @xcite .",
    "the next step was to generate corrections for the copious @xmath0 absorption seen throughout the fuse spectral region .",
    "this was done by determining the physical parameters of the @xmath0 absorbing gas and generating a model spectrum of the @xmath0 absorption .",
    "the details of the @xmath0 and modeling are given in @xcite .",
    "when correcting a fuse spectrum for @xmath0 and absorption , any point which is absorbed by more than 70% was excluded from use in generating an extinction curve , to minimize the effects of the uncertainties in the @xmath0 and corrections on the resulting extinction curves .",
    "the residual effects of the @xmath0 and absorption on the final extinction curves are discussed in  [ sec_structure ] .",
    "the complimentary iue spectra ( 1150  3225   ) were taken from the iue archive following vcg04 .",
    "optical and near - infrared photometry was accumulated from the literature also following vcg04 .",
    "the spectral overlap between the iue and fuse observations was used to derive a multiplicative correction to the fuse spectra to put them on the same flux scale as the iue spectra .",
    "the corrections are generally small with maximum corrections up to 25% . finally , the fuse and iue spectra were rebinned to a common resolution of 250 which is sufficient for most extinction curve work .      calculating an extinction curve for the sightline towards a reddened star",
    "requires an unreddened comparison star of the same spectral type . for iue observations",
    ", there exists a good set of bright , lightly reddened comparison stars which have been carefully dereddened @xcite .",
    "ideally , fuse observations of these same iue comparison stars would be used to extend their spectra to far - uv wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately , many of the iue comparison stars are too bright to be observable with fuse . a new set of fainter comparison stars that are observable with fuse is required .",
    "we have generated the fuse set of comparison stars by picking the least reddened star of each spectral type that has both fuse and iue observations .",
    "the new comparison star sample is listed in table  [ tab_comp_stars ] along with the parameters used to deredden their iue and fuse spectra .",
    "the @xmath0 and model parameters used to remove the affects of @xmath0 absorption are given by @xcite .",
    "given the fuse brightness limit , these stars are necessarily more distant and reddened than the iue comparison star sample .",
    "we have carefully dereddened these new comparison stars following the methods of @xcite .",
    "the dereddening was done starting with @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xcite parameters taken from vcg04 .",
    "thus , these new comparison stars are directly bootstrapped off of the existing iue comparison stars .",
    "the use of fm parameters determined in the iue spectral range to deredden fuse spectra is supported by earlier work on fuse extinction curves showing that the extrapolation of the fm fits to the fuse wavelength range is reasonable @xcite .",
    "we have checked that this extrapolation is not affecting our results in  [ sec_rv_rel ] . as was done by @xcite ,",
    "the dereddening parameters were then manually tweaked to produce dereddened spectra that lacked obvious dust extinction and had a smooth progression between spectral types .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_standards ] where the observed and dereddened spectra for each class of standards ( main sequence , giants , and supergiants ) are shown .",
    "the uncertainties on the dereddening parameters was estimated by changing each parameter until it was clearly incorrect .",
    "the resulting uncertainties are given in table  [ tab_comp_stars ] and are assumed to be one sigma uncertainties to be conservative .",
    "an alternative to using observed comparison stars is to use stellar atmosphere models .",
    "this is an approach that has been explored by @xcite and found to produce similar results to using observed comparison stars .",
    "the strength of using model atmospheres is that it removes the need to deredden observed spectra and should provide closer spectral matches .",
    "the weakness is that it relies on the accuracy of the stellar atmosphere models and the absolute calibration of the spectra .",
    "observed comparison stars only rely on the relative calibration of the spectra and , by definition , include the same physics as the reddened stars .",
    "the use of observed comparison stars does inject some additional uncertainty due to the lack of `` perfect '' matches to the reddened star spectral types . in the end , using observed or model comparison stars represent complimentary approaches , each with strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the fact that they produce similar results provides strong evidence that the resulting extinction curves derived from either method are correct .",
    "the extinction curves were calculated using the standard pair method @xcite .",
    "basically , the ratio of the fluxes of the reddened and comparison stars ( both with the same spectral type ) gives a direct measurement of the dust extinction towards the reddened star .",
    "ideally , the distances to the reddened and comparison stars would be known to high accuracy , allowing for an absolute measurement of the dust extinction .",
    "unfortunately , the distances to the hot , early - type stars used for ultraviolet dust extinction curve measurements are rarely , if ever , known to high enough accuracy .",
    "it is possible then to make a differential measurement of the difference between the colors of reddened and comparison stars .",
    "the basic measurement is @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 subscripts refer to the reddened and comparison stars , respectively .",
    "this measurement is the unnormalized extinction curve .",
    "the use of colors w.r.t .",
    "the v band removes the unknown or uncertain distance to each of the stars from the measurement . in order to make comparisons between extinction curves measured along different sightlines",
    ", the curve needs to be normalized to a measurement of the total column of dust along the sightline .",
    "the most often used normalization is to divide @xmath140 by @xmath135 . yet",
    "a more direct measure of the dust properties is @xmath3 .",
    "there are two avenues to determining @xmath3 from the basic @xmath140 measurement .",
    "the usual method is to determine the conversion factor @xmath5 [ @xmath141 by extrapolating the @xmath142 curve at jhk wavelengths to infinite wavelength using an assumed form of the @xmath3 curve at wavelengths @xmath143  . the conversion is then @xmath144 + 1\\ ] ] a more direct way is to extrapolate the @xmath140 curve to infinite wavelength using the same assumptions [ jhk wavelengths and an assumed @xmath3 curve ] to determine @xmath136 .",
    "the conversion is then @xmath145 functionally , both methods of determining @xmath3 are equivalent .",

    "this set of 75 fuse extinction curves represents a large increase in the number of extinction curves well measured in the far - ultraviolet .    using this sample , we investigated the nature of the far - uv extinction with three methods .",

    "all the extinction curves had positive far - uv rises when fit with the fuse+iue data giving no indication that the far - uv rise was turning over at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "we tested the new fm07 parameterization ( with 1 additional parameter and a simplified far - uv rise term ) using the combined fuse+iue curves and found only a weak preference for the fm07 parameterization .",
    "we choose to use the fm90 parameterization as it is simpler and provides for direct comparisons to previous work .",
    "the second investigation of the far - uv extinction concentrated on deriving the @xmath5 dependent relationship .",

    "we present our @xmath5 dependent relationship for the entire uv ( @xmath6 ) using the same functional form as used by ccm89 .    finally , we searched for discrete absorption features in the far - uv .",
