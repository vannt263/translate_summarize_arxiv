    "astronomical observations in the two extremes of the electromagnetic spectrum , in the domain of the hard x - rays on one hand , and in the domain of radio wavelengths on the other hand , led in recent years to the discovery of several galactic sources of relativistic outflows ( see mirabel & rodrguez 1995 for a review ) .",
    "in addition to the classic stellar jet source ss433 ( margon 1984 ) , which for several years was believed to be unique in the galaxy , two new jet sources that exhibit apparent superluminal motions were discovered : grs 1915 + 105 ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( tingay et al . 1995 ; hjellming & rupen 1995 ) .",
    "because of their relative proximity , this class of sources may offer new insights for the general understanding of the relativistic jets seen elsewhere in the universe .    due to the required strong doppler favoritism , in distant quasars proper motions have been detected so far only in the jet that is beamed toward the observer ( kellerman & owen , 1988 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that small - scale counterjets have been detected toward a few quasars ( e. g. carilli et al .",
    "1994 ; taylor 1996 ; walker et al . 1994 ) and that future observations may detect proper motions in these extragalactic counterjets . since in the newly discovered galactic superluminal sources two - sided moving jets were detected , there was the hope that these sources would provide crucial information to test the physical models of relativistic jets in astrophysics .",
    "however , in gro j1655 - 40 the jets are asymmetric and the sense of the asymmetry changes from event to event ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) . in this paper",
    "we show that the observations of repeated ejections in grs 1915 + 105 are consistent with intrinsically symmetric twin jets , which permits for the first time to overcome several of the fundamental uncertainties that have dominated the physical interpretation of superluminal motions in astronomy .",
    "the monitoring of the repeated ejections reported here were carried out with the very large array ( vla ) of nraoduring 1994 february - august in the a , a / b , and b configurations , and in 1995 august in the a configuration .",
    "most of the observations were made at the frequency of 8.4 ghz ( 3.6-cm ) , using 1328 + 307 as absolute amplitude calibrator and 1923 + 210 as phase calibrator .",
    "observations made at 20 and 2-cm on 1994 april 16 with the same absolute and phase calibrators were used to obtain the spectra presented in figure 4 .",
    "a more detailed description of the observations and first partial results from this monitoring were presented by mirabel & rodrguez ( 1994 ) and rodrguez et al .",
    "the data were calibrated , edited , and reduced using the nrao software package aips .",
    "in 1994 february - august we followed the proper motions of four pairs of plasma clouds moving away from the compact core of grs 1915 + 105 , located at position @xmath2 ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) .",
    "an additional ejection event was observed in 1995 august 10 .",
    "the position and total flux densities of the condensations were determined using the aips task imfit , that fits gaussian ellipsoids to the sources using a least - squares criterion . in some epochs ,",
    "it was not possible to have a solution for a weak condensation in the immediate vicinity of a bright one , and positions and flux densities were roughly estimated directly from the maps . in table 1",
    "we list the parameters of the observations and the angular displacements from the central core for these four ejection events .",
    "figure 1 shows the source at epoch 1994 april 09 , where two condensation pairs ; that ejected in 1994 february 19 and that ejected in 1994 march 19 are clearly visible . in figure 2",
    "we show the proper motions of the condensations detected from the four ejection events of 1994 .",
    "we conclude that before and after the remarkable ejection event of 1994 march 19 , reported in detail by mirabel & rodrguez ( 1994 ) , the compact source ejected other pairs of condensations but with flux densities one to two orders of magnitude fainter .",
    "the epoch of the ejection ( as determined from the convergence of the regression lines on the same point of the time axis ) , the position angles of the direction of motion , and the proper motions for each pair are given in table 2 .",
    "the first three ejections of 1994 and the one observed in 1995 took place at epochs when the source was being detected by batse in the 20 - 100 kev energy band ( harmon et al .",
    "the time separation between ejections suggests a quasiperiodicity at intervals in the range of 20 - 30 days .",
    "although the clouds appear to move always in the same general region of the sky , the position angles listed in table 1 suggest a change by @xmath0 10@xmath1 of the direction of ejection in one month .",
    "the four pairs moved away from the compact core with proper motions that , within error , are similar ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the proper motions away from the stationary core shown in table 2 and figure 2 are consistent with ballistic ( that is , unaccelerated ) proper motions . for the bright pair ejected on 1994 march 19",
    "the proper motions could be determined very accurately ( see table 2 ) . in this case , the angular displacements were followed for about 50 days while the ejecta remained detectable . in contrast , due to limitations imposed by sensitivity and array configuration , only the approaching component of the pair ejected in 1994 jan 29 could be detected .",
    "the proper motions listed in table 2 for the 1995 august 10 ejection are unreliable since the individual condensations were resolved only in one epoch . in figure 3",
    "we show a radio map of the ejecta pair for this event .",
    "this event was accompanied by infrared and x - ray activity and has been discussed in detail by mirabel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . despite the considerable uncertainty in the parameters of the 1995 august 10 ejection",
    ", there appear to be significant variations in proper motions and position angle with respect to the set of ejections observed in 1994 .",
    "further research is needed to establish if fainter events , as is the case for the 1995 ejection , are systematically different from the type of bright ejections seen in 1994 .",
    "also the proper motions observed by fender et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with the merlin interferometer for the ejection event of 1997 october ( 23.6@xmath30.5 mas day@xmath4 for the approaching ejecta and 10.0@xmath30.5 mas day@xmath4 for the receding ejecta ) appear to be different at the 10 - 20 % level from the proper motions of the 1994 events ( see table 2 ) . at present",
    "it is unclear if these differences are due to an intrinsic change in the velocity of the ejecta or to a change in the angle of ejection .",
    "mirabel & rodrguez ( 1994 ) have modeled the motions in figure 2 for the 1994 events as antiparallel ejections of twin pairs of plasma clouds moving at relativistic speed @xmath5 = v / c . under this assumption ,",
    "the apparent velocities in the sky are given by :    @xmath6    the asymmetry in the proper motions between the approaching and receding clouds can be explained in terms of relativistic aberration . in the previous equation ,",
    "@xmath7 is the angle between the ejection axis and the line of sight . at a kinematic distance of 12.5 kpc ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1995 ) the proper motions of the approaching and receding condensations imply apparent velocities on the plane of the sky of @xmath8 = 1.25c and @xmath9 = 0.65c for the approaching and receding components respectively .",
    "the ejecta move with a true speed of @xmath10 = 0.92c at an angle @xmath7 = 70@xmath1 with respect to the line of sight ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) .",
    "due to relativistic aberration the brightness ratio of the approaching and receding condensations ( measured at equal distances from the core ) is given ( pearson & zensus 1987 ) by    @xmath11    in this equation , @xmath12 is the observed spectral index of the radiation and @xmath13 is a parameter related to the geometry of the jet ( @xmath13=2 for a continuous jet , while @xmath13=3 for discrete condensations ) .",
    "the flux densities of the bright condensations ejected on 1994 march 19 are shown in figure 4 for the epoch 1994 april 16 .",
    "the spectral indices of both condensations are identical within error , @xmath12 = @xmath140.8@xmath30.1 .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical expectations . indeed , since the ratio @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 being the intensity and @xmath17 the frequency of the radiation ) is lorentz invariant ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) it can be shown that for radiation with a power law spectrum , the spectral index will be the same for all observers in moving frames of reference .",
    "then , since @xmath5 = 0.92 and @xmath7 = 70@xmath1 , the ratio of the apparent surface brightnesses for a given angular distance from the ejection center is predicted to be in between 6 ( k = 2 for continuous jets ) and 12 ( k = 3 for discrete clouds ) .    figures 5 and 6 show that for a given angular separation , the observed flux ratio between the approaching and receding condensations for the ejections of 1994 march 19 and 1994 april 21 was 8 @xmath3 1 .",
    "therefore , the apparent motions observed in grs 1915 + 105 are consistent with true bulk relativistic motions of the matter that emits the radio waves .",
    "bodo & ghisellini ( 1995 ) have proposed that there could be a small contribution of wave propagation in the pattern motions , but that most of the observed displacements are true bulk plasma velocities .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show that for the ejections of 1994 march 19 and april 21 the clouds faded out as they moved away from the core with power law dependences given by s@xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20@xmath21 ( for the 1994 march 19 ejecta ) and s@xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20@xmath22 ( for the 1994 april 21 ejecta ) , with @xmath20 being the angular displacement from the core .",
    "these power law indices are an average of the power laws for the approaching and receding condensations . for the 1994 april 21 ejecta",
    "( see figure 6 ) there is some indication that the power law indices for the approaching and receding condensations are different .",
    "however , their actual values ( @xmath142.1@xmath30.7 and @xmath143.1@xmath30.4 , respectively ) are not significantly different within error and we adopt the average value given above .",
    "the 1994 march 19 clouds were detected only within 0.8 arc sec from the core , while the 1994 april 21 clouds could be studied only beyond 1 arc sec from the core .",
    "this limitation comes mostly from the fact that the vla changed configuration and thus angular resolution ( from 0.2 arc sec to 0.6 arc sec ) during our observations and the fainter 1994 april 21 clouds could be studied individually only after they separated considerably .",
    "although we are comparing clouds ejected in two different events , the different indices suggest a faster decrease in flux densities beyond around 1 arc sec . indeed ,",
    "even the bright condensations of the 1994 march 19 ejection became undetectable beyond about one arc sec from the core , while extrapolation from their decrease as a function of angular displacement for observations within one arc sec from the core implied that they should had remained detectable within a few arc sec from the core .",
    "this steepening of the decrease in flux density with angular separation was first observed and discussed in detail in the context of x - ray binaries in the case of ss  433 ( hjellming & johnston 1988 ) .",
    "these authors propose that the steepening occurs when the jet goes from a slowed or constrained expansion close to the central source to a free expansion regime at some distance .",
    "remarkably , in both grs  1915 + 105 and ss  433 the decrease close to the source can be described approximately with @xmath23 , while beyond a distance of @xmath24 cm , @xmath25 is observed .",
    "this steepening of the decrease in flux density with angular separation is also probably related to the similar tendency observed in the jets of some radio galaxies , where the intensity declines as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 = 1.2 - 1.6 in the inner regions and @xmath284 in the outer regions of the jet ( bridle & perley 1984 ) .    in figure 7",
    "we show the time evolution of the flux densities for the approaching and receding clouds of the 1994 march 19 event .",
    "the smooth fading of the expelled clouds that is apparent in figure 5 as a function of angular distance , and in figure 7 as a function of time , provide additional support for the interpretation of the observed motions in terms of bulk motions rather than the propagation of pulses . in the latter ,",
    "due to the inhomogeneity of the interstellar medium one would expect more erratic fluctuations in the flux density fading and in the proper motions .",
    "since we are dealing with ballistic motions , the angular displacements are proportional to time , and the decrease in flux density with time shown in figure 7 is consistent with s@xmath18 @xmath19 t@xmath21 , that is , the same power - law index found for the decrease in flux density with angular displacement .",
    "this is as expected , since given the ballistic nature of the motions angular displacement and time are related linearly .",
    "are these observed power - law dependences modified by the motion of the condensations ? if the flux density ( or another parameter ) of a constant - velocity condensation varies with time as a power law in the frame of reference of the condensation , the flux density ( or another parameter ) , as seen by a stationary observer will also vary as a power law , and furthermore , the exponent of the power law will be the same for both frames of reference ( in other words , the exponents of these power law dependences with time are lorentz invariant ) . to verify this ,",
    "assume that in the reference frame of the moving condensation the parameter varies as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the time in this reference frame .",
    "then , since @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the time in the observer s frame , we find that here the parameter will vary as @xmath33 , as seen by the observer at rest . here",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 .      to estimate the mass and energy of the clouds ejected from grs 1915 + 105 we now concentrate on the major event of 1994 march 19 , for which we have the largest wavelength coverage and the best signal - to - noise data .",
    "we first calculate the magnetic fields . for the approaching condensation on 1994 march 24",
    "the deconvolved angular dimensions were of 60 @xmath36 20 mas ( see mirabel & rodrguez , 1994 ) , with the major axis approximately aligned along the outflow axis .",
    "the flux density was 655 mjy at 3.6-cm .",
    "the spectral index between 1.4 and 15 ghz was about -0.4 .",
    "these parameters have to be corrected for relativistic effects on the doppler boosting and the apparent angular size .",
    "the ratio of the observed flux densities @xmath37 for the approaching and @xmath38 for the receding ejecta relative to the emitted ( in the frame of reference of the condensation ) flux density @xmath39 is .1 in    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the doppler factor @xmath42 for the approaching and receding condensations .1 in    @xmath43 .1 in    since @xmath5 = 0.92 and @xmath7 = 70@xmath1 , we get @xmath44 = 2.6 , and @xmath45 = 0.56 .",
    "using equation ( 3 ) with k = 3 , the estimated flux density @xmath39 ( in the frame of reference of the blob ) at 3.6-cm is about 4.4 jy ( about 7 times larger than the observed flux density ) .",
    "the real major axis , @xmath46 , is related to the observed ( in projection ) major axis , @xmath47 , by .1 in    @xmath48 .1 in    that is , @xmath46 = 1.9 @xmath47 .",
    "then , the true dimensions of the jet are 110 @xmath36 20 mas .",
    "we then take as characteristic dimension a geometric mean of 35 mas ( or @xmath49 cm at a distance of 12.5 kpc ) .    using the formulation of pacholczyk ( 1970 ) for minimum energy and integrating from 1.4 ghz to 15 ghz ( the range over which rodrguez et al .",
    "1995 measured the flux densities on that date ) , _ and assuming only relativistic electrons , _ a magnetic field of about 50 mgauss and an energy of about @xmath50 ergs in the relativistic electrons are obtained .",
    "the timescale for significant synchrotron losses is of order 50 years . due to the expansion of the condensations , the magnetic field decreases with distance .",
    "a similar calculation for the approaching condensation on 1994 april 16 gives a magnetic field of about 7 mgauss and an energy of about @xmath51 ergs in the relativistic electrons .",
    "as expected , the magnetic field shows a significant decrease while the energy in relativistic electrons remains roughly constant .    multiplying the energy by two to account also for the receding condensation one obtains @xmath52 ergs in relativistic electrons for that epoch .",
    "this is , of course , the _ internal _ relativistic energy in the radio condensations .",
    "in addition , the plasma clouds have a kinetic energy due to their bulk motion at 0.92c .",
    "to estimate the mass of the blobs one can use the usual formula for critical frequency for synchrotron radiation .1 in    @xmath53    and since we saw strong radiation up to 240 ghz ( iram observations made on 1993 december 6 by rodrguez et al .",
    "1995 ) with a magnetic field of tens of mgauss , we adopt @xmath54 = 1000 as a rough average value for the ( internal ) motion of the relativistic electrons .",
    "then , dividing the total energy over @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the electron rest mass , one can obtain the number n of ( relativistic ) electrons in the blobs .",
    "the mass of the plasma clouds can be obtained in two different ways .",
    "1 ) assuming that there is one ( non - relativistic ) proton per ( relativistic ) electron one gets a proton mass estimate in the order of 10@xmath57 g. 2 ) assuming that there are no protons in the plasma clouds one obtains a similar mass because the electrons are moving so fast that their relativistic mass ( as opposed to their rest mass ) is comparable to that of the non - relativistic protons .",
    "in other words , the energy estimate in relativistic electrons equals @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relativistic mass of the blob ( from electrons alone ) is @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , taking the relativistic energy and dividing over @xmath60 gives the relativistic mass in electrons , which also is about 10@xmath57 grams .",
    "this is the mass one has to use to estimate the relativistic kinetic energy of the blobs ( due to their bulk motion at 0.92c or @xmath61 = 2.6 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence or absence of non - relativistic protons affects the mass estimate by a factor of 2 only .",
    "since it is likely that the condensations contain also non - relativistic particles , the mass estimated should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "then , the blobs have comparable amounts of internal and kinetic bulk energy .",
    "the internal energy is @xmath62 while the kinetic bulk energy is of order @xmath63 . since @xmath61 = 2.6 ,",
    "both energies are comparable .    assuming that there is one non - relativistic proton for each relativistic electron , the estimated total rest mass of the condensations is of order @xmath6410@xmath57",
    "g. this mass could be a significant fraction of the mass of the inner parts of the accretion disk , since it is equivalent to the total mass that would be accumulated in the disk over several days at the typical rate of 10@xmath65 m@xmath66 yr@xmath4 that is required to account for the x - ray light curve of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "analysis of the x - ray spectra of grs  1915 + 105 suggests that some of the large amplitude variations in the light curves can be described as resulting from the rapid removal and replenishment of matter from the inner part of an accretion disk ( belloni et al .",
    "1997 ; mirabel et al .",
    "in fact , the ejection on 1995 august 10 occurred when a sharp decay and follow - up rise was observed in the batse light curve for the 20 - 100 kev energy band ( harmon et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the plasma clouds suggests an acceleration mechanism with very large power . from the radio monitoring with the nanay radiotelescope",
    "it is known that the ejection event of 1994 march 19 lasted @xmath67 12 hours , ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1995 ) , requiring a _ minimum _ power of the order of 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath4 is larger than the maximum steady photon luminosity of grs 1915 + 105 , @xmath69 erg s@xmath4 , suggesting that a radiative acceleration mechanism is improbable .",
    "the mechanism that accelerates and collimates the grs  1915 + 105 ejecta is yet unclear .",
    "from the vla observations of repeated ejections in 1994 january - august we conclude that :      \\2 ) in 1994 january - august the ejeccions took place with a quasi - periodicity of 20 - 30 days . a change by @xmath0 10@xmath1 of the ejection axis in an interval of @xmath0 1 month was observed .",
    "however , the precession over intervals of more than one year is unlikely to be greater than 10@xmath1 .",
    "\\3 ) the flux ratio and flux time evolution of the clouds moving in opposite directions are consistent with actual bulk motions at relativistic speeds of the sources of radiation .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that in grs 1915 + 105 the observed motions could represent the propagation of pulses and/or echos .",
    "\\4 ) the flux of the clouds expelled on 1994 march 19 appear to decrease slower than predicted from adiabatic expansion , as it is also observed in other galactic and extragalactic jets .",
    "it is possible that part of the bulk energy of the jets is converted to magnetic flux and relativistic particles through dissipative interactions with the surrounding medium or within the jet itself .",
    "there is a steepening of the decrease in flux density with angular separation .",
    "remarkably , in both grs  1915 + 105 and ss  433 the decrease close to the source can be described with @xmath23 , while beyond a distance of @xmath24 cm , @xmath25 is observed .",
    "\\5 ) the repeated ejecta discussed here can reach relativistic equivalent masses of about 10@xmath57 g and kinetic energies in the order of 10@xmath70 ergs , as in the case of the 1994 march 19 event . however , the other ejecta events have masses and energies an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "\\6 ) there are ejections with kinetic power @xmath64 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath4 , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the mean x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "7 ) a comparison of the parameters of the 1994 ejections with those observed in the 1997 ejection suggests the presence of differences at the 10 - 20 % level in the proper motions . at present",
    "it is unclear if these differences are due to an intrinsic change in the velocity of the ejecta or to a change in the angle of ejection .",
