    "the operation of any computing device is necessarily a physical process , and this fundamentally determines the possibilities and limitations of the computing machine .",
    "a common thread in the history of computers is the exploitation and manipulation of different natural phenomena to obtain newer forms of computing paradigms @xcite .",
    "for instance , chaos computing @xcite , neurobiologically inspired computing , quantum computing@xcite , and dna computing@xcite all aim to utilize , at the basic level , some of the computational capabilities inherent in natural systems .",
    "in particular , larger understanding of biological systems has triggered the interesting question : what new directions do bio - systems offer for understanding and implementing computations ?",
    "the broad idea then , is to create machines that benefit from natural phenomena and utilize patterns inherent in systems to encode inputs and subsequently obtain a desired output .",
    "different physical principles can yield logic outputs , for logic gates such as and , or , xor , nor and nand which form the basis of the universal general - purpose computation .",
    "it is particularly interesting if systems of biological relevance can also yield logic outputs consistent with the truth tables of different logic functions @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will explore the computational possibilities arising from the dynamics of a genetic network with quorum sensing feedback .",
    "quorum sensing allows cells to sense their own density and to communicate with each other , giving the cells the ability to behave as a population instead of individually .",
    "the autoinduction of luminescence in the symbiotic marine bacterium _",
    "vibrio fischeri _ is perhaps the best characterized example of quorum sensing .",
    "some other examples include sporulation and fruiting body formation by _",
    "myxococcus xanthus _ and antibiotic production by several species of _ streptomyces_. the way quorum sensing is accomplished in cells is through diffusive exchange of auto - inducer molecules which participate in intercellular coupling and self feedback . at low cell density ,",
    "the auto inducer is synthesized at basal levels and diffuses into the extracellular space and gets diluted .",
    "but as the cell density increases , the intracellular autoinducer concentration increases until it reaches a threshold beyond which it is produced auto - catalytically .",
    "this results in a dramatic increase of product concentrations , thus creating bi - stability between a high steady state and a low steady state @xcite .",
    "specifically , in this work we focus on an artificial genetic network known as the repressilator , with feedback of the kind that quorum sensing may provide to an isolated repressilator .",
    "a repressilator consists of a ring of three genes , products of which inhibit each other in cyclic order .",
    "the quorum sensing feedback stimulates the activity of a chosen gene providing competition between the inbitory and the stimulatory activities localized in that gene . in this work",
    "we attempt to use the varying concentrations of proteins in the repressilator , arising due to quorum sensing feedback , to realize different logic gates .    in the sections below we",
    "will first discuss the model of the repressilator genetic network with quorum sensing feedback , and present the change in dynamics of repressilator proteins with changing parameters of the quorum sensing feedback .",
    "we will then go on to use this dynamics to implement a range of logic functions , by appropriate input - output associations .",
    "we consider a basic genetic ring oscillator network in which three genes inhibit each other in unidirectional manner , and an additional quorum sensing feedback loop stimulates the activity of a chosen gene , providing competition between inhibitory and stimulatory activities localized in that gene . this system is known to yield behaviour ranging from limit cycles , to high and low stable steady states @xcite .    in the model , 3 genes in a cyclic loop forms mrna ( @xmath0 ) and proteins ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the three genes inhibit each other , where one gene is inhibited by the preceding gene .",
    "quorum sensing feedback acts between gene @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath2 stimulates the production of @xmath3 by quorum sensing along with an inhibitory action .",
    "the model can be reduced to fast mrna kinetics , where @xmath0 is assumed to be in a steady state with their respective proteins ( @xmath1 ) , leading to @xmath4 .",
    "the equations describing the dynamics of this system then are :    @xmath5    here @xmath6 denotes the concentration of the auto - inducer ai .",
    "the relevant parameters in this system are the ratio of protein decay rate to mrna decay rate @xmath7 , maximum transcription rate in the absence of an inhibitor @xmath8 , hill co - efficient for inhibition @xmath9 , diffusion co - efficient depending on the permeability of the membrane to auto - inducer molecule @xmath10 , the rate of auto - inducer decay to mrna decay rate @xmath11 , rate of auto - inducer production @xmath12 , and most importantly , the co - efficient for the production of @xmath3 protein due to auto - inducer @xmath13 and the concentration of auto - inducer in external medium @xmath14 responsible for the _ quorum sensing feedback_.    in our simulations we fix the parameters at realistic values @xcite : @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( relevant to slow protein kinetics ) .",
    "we vary the parameters that determine the strength of quorum sensing , namely @xmath14 and @xmath13 .    on taking different values of parameters @xmath14 and @xmath13 , the strength of quorum sensing changes , and hence the qualitative nature of the dynamics changes .",
    "this is clearly evident from the bifurcation analysis of the concentrations of protein @xmath20 and @xmath2 with respect to parameters @xmath14 and @xmath13 displayed in figs .",
    "[ bifsext]-[bifkappa ] , which shows the change in dynamics from limt cycles to stable steady states as the external concentration of auto - inducer increases .",
    "there is also a sudden switch in the value of the steady state after a critical value of @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "now , in order to utilize this system to realize a logic gate we need to propose an appropriate _ input - output mapping _ , namely , we must first suggest how inputs and outputs are encoded .",
    "the task at hand then , is to ensure that this input and output encoding _ consistently yields the correct input - output association corresponding to different logic functions _ , as displayed in the truth table ( table i ) .",
    "specifically , here we will implement a series of logic gates , such as and / nand , or / nor and xor / xnor , using the change in dynamics of protein @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "further we will obtain logic operations in parallel by simultaneous measurement of the concentrations of these two proteins .",
    "+    * encoding logic inputs : * + consider the inputs to be encoded by @xmath14 , namely the concentration of auto - inducer in external medium , which is responsible for the quorum sensing feedback .    we propose that the two inputs @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 encode the two logic inputs as follows :    a.   when logic input is @xmath24 , @xmath25 ; b.   when logic input is @xmath26 , @xmath27 ;    so the pair of inputs lead to the following three distinct conditions :    a.   @xmath28  for  input  set  @xmath29 b.   @xmath30  for  input  set  @xmath31 c.   @xmath32  for  input  set  @xmath33 +    * encoding logic output :",
    "* + we consider the _ maximum protein concentration as an indicator of the output of the system_. specifically we consider the maximum concentrations of proteins @xmath20 and @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "this gives us the ability to obtain two outputs from the system in parallel .",
    "now a prescribed output determination threshold , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , leads to the mapping of the concentration to a @xmath38 logic output , as folllows :    for protein @xmath20 :    a.   if @xmath39 , then the logic output is @xmath24 b.   if @xmath40 , then the logic output is @xmath26    and for protein @xmath2 :    a.   if @xmath41 , then the logic output is @xmath24 b.   if @xmath42 , then the logic output is @xmath26    one can obtain the _",
    "complementary gates _ by exchanging the output determination criterion .",
    "namely :    for protein @xmath20 :    a.   if @xmath43 , then the logic output is @xmath24 b.   if @xmath44 , then the logic output is @xmath26    and for protein @xmath2 :    a.   if @xmath42 , then the logic output is @xmath24 b.   if @xmath41 , then the logic output is @xmath26 +    * controlling the nature of the logic function * : + we can control the type of logic operation obtained by simply changing the output determination threshold .",
    "namely , we can obtain and / nand , or / nor or xor / xnor input - output mappings by considering different @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , for realizing the fundamental nand logic gate ( see truth table i ) , we have the binary logic output determined by the threshold level @xmath45 .",
    "namely , if the maximum concentration of protein @xmath20 , @xmath34 is greater than @xmath36 , then the logic output is @xmath26 , and if @xmath46 , then logic output is @xmath24 .",
    "this is clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ nand_a ] and table [ nand_a_table ] .    in order to change the logic function from the fundamental nand gate to the funademental nor gate",
    ", we simply have to change the prescribed output determination threshold .",
    "specifically , the system yields nor logic when the output determination threshold @xmath36 is @xmath47 .    similarly , using different output determination thresholds @xmath37 for protein concentration @xmath2 , we can obtain and and xnor logic operations .",
    "this is clearly evident through fig .",
    "[ and_b ] and table [ and_b_table ] .",
    "again note that the complementary logic functions nand and xor are implemented by a simple toggle of the logic output determination condition .",
    "so we can obtain any combination of and / nand / or / nor in parallel with and / nand / xor / xnor logic through the two protein concentrations for the same pair of inputs . in fig .",
    "[ timeseries ] , the time series plots for protein @xmath20 and @xmath2 exhibits the simultaneous realization of nand and xnor gates respectively , for a representative random stream of input values .",
    "clearly , this same system can yield xor and and in parallel by the alternate output association , namely a logic output @xmath26 is obtained when the proteins @xmath20 and @xmath2 are below output threshold @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "in fact , the combination of and and xor in parallel is particularly useful , as it forms the basis of the ubiquitous _ bit - by - bit addition_.    alternately , the logic operation may also be changed by a constant shift in input encoding , namely @xmath48 , where different values of @xmath49 yield different logic functions .",
    "for instance , using protein @xmath2 for output determination , and keeping level @xmath37 fixed at @xmath50 , @xmath51 yields xnor , and @xmath52 yields nand .",
    "similarly , using protein @xmath20 for output determination , with @xmath53 , @xmath51 yields nand , and @xmath54 yields nor .",
    "+    * using activation rate parameter @xmath13 to encode logic inputs * : + we now consider an alternate input encoding , with the logic inputs determining @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is held fixed at @xmath55 , and varying @xmath13 yields different protein concentrations , which leads to different outputs ( see figs .",
    "[ kappa_a]-[kappa_b ] ) .",
    "specifically , let @xmath13 be determined by the logic inputs @xmath22 and @xmath23 as follows : @xmath56 with @xmath57 when logic input is @xmath24 , and @xmath58 when logic input is @xmath26 .",
    "taking a base value of @xmath59 , we have :    a.   @xmath60 when input set ( @xmath61 ) is @xmath62 b.   @xmath63 when input set ( @xmath61 ) is @xmath64 c.   @xmath65 when input set ( @xmath61 ) is @xmath66    the binary logic output is obtained from the maximum concentration of proteins @xmath20 and @xmath2 , as before .",
    "namely , we determine the logic output through a threshold : if @xmath67 , then logic output is @xmath24 , and if @xmath67 , then logic output is @xmath26 .    as before ,",
    "the nature of the logic function obtained can be controlled by the output determination threshold for the proteins @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath68 we obtain nand logic and for @xmath69 we obtain the fundamental nor operation .",
    "similarly , when @xmath70 we obtain and and for @xmath71 we obtain xnor .",
    "representative values are displayed in tables [ kappa_a_table ] and [ kappa_b_table ] .    hence , xnor / xor / and / nand and nand / and / nor / or gates can be realized in parallel for the same set of inputs .",
    "namely , by setting the appropriate output determination condition , the protein concentrations can yield any of the logic functions xnor / xor / and / nand and nand / and / nor / or independently and simultaneously .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated how a genetic ring oscillator network with quorum sensing feedback can operate as a robust logic gate .",
    "we use the concentration of auto - inducer in external medium @xmath14 , and alternatively an activation rate parameter @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "1 ) , to encode logic inputs .",
    "both these quantities regulate the strength of the quorum sensing feedback .",
    "the concentrations of proteins @xmath20 and @xmath2 determine the logic outputs .",
    "this input - output association yields a range of logic functions , namely and / nand , or / nor and xor / xnor .",
    "so the system can act as a versatile unit that can morph between different logic operations .",
    "we further demonstrated the capacity of this system to yield different logic operations simultaneously through the two proteins @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "these observations may provide an understanding of the computational capacity of systems with quorum sensing feedback .",
    "it also may have potential relevance in the design of biological gates , with the ability to flexibly reconfigure logic operations , and implement logic operations in parallel .",
