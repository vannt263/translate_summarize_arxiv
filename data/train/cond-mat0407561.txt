    "<S> coupled to two or three dimensional phonons , the dimerized phase can persist for temperatures @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spin - peierls transition temperature . for @xmath3 , the chains are undistorted and and one recovers gapless spin excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition at @xmath4 between the dimerized and the uniform state is a second - order phase transition and has been observed in a host of quasi - one dimensional organic materials such as ttfcus@xmath5c@xmath5(cf@xmath6)@xmath5 and ttfaus@xmath5c@xmath5(cf@xmath6)@xmath5 ( also known as ttfcubdt and ttfaubdt)@xcite , mem-(tcnq)@xmath7@xcite,(tmttf)@xmath7pf@xmath8 , ( tmttf)@xmath7asf@xmath8@xcite , and ( bcpttf)@xmath7pf@xmath8.@xcite the discovery of the inorganic material@xcite cugeo@xmath6 , spurred further activity in this domain as this system is more convenient for neutron scattering studies .    from the theory point of view , most of the treatments consider the phonons as static.@xcite this mean field treatment of the phonons is expected to work when the phonon frequency can be neglected ( adiabatic limit ) compared to the spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach is thus better suited to the softer organic materials than to the inorganic compound cugeo@xmath6 where the frequency of the phonon driving the transition is not small compared to the spin gap.@xcite however , a common feature of the spin - peierls transition in all the spin - peierls compounds , is that some data indicate a bcs type mean field behavior of the thermodynamic quantities near the transition.@xcite for instance , a bcs type relationship@xcite , @xmath9 , between the zero temperature spin gap and the spin peierls transition temperature @xmath2 has been observed in cugeo@xmath6 , and it was used to argue that the transition in this material could also be described within mean field theory . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , despite these deviations , phenomenological landau - ginzburg theories can be used to some extent to fit the critical behavior of cugeo@xmath6.@xcite therefore , it is important to develop a more quantitative description of the mean field theory of the spin - peierls transition , particularly in the gapped phase in order to have a more reliable comparison of the predictions of the mean - field scenario with experimental data on the spin peierls materials .    in the first theoretical approaches to the spin - peierls transitions@xcite , the spin chain was mapped onto a model of interacting one - dimensional spinless fermions by the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite and the interactions between the fermions were either neglected@xcite or treated in the hartree - fock approximation.@xcite later , in ref .  , though the phonons were still treated at the mean field level , the spin chain was described using bosonization which correctly describes the quantum critical behavior of the pure spin @xmath0 chain.@xcite a linear response treatment of the spin - phonon coupling resulted in a much improved estimation of dependence of the transition temperature on the spin phonon interaction . furthermore , a landau ginzburg expansion was developed to study the vicinity of the transition .    however , in contrast to refs .   </S>",
    "<S> no prediction could be made for the thermodynamics in the dimerized phase . </S>",
    "<S> there are two reasons for this . </S>",
