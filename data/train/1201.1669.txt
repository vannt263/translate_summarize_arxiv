    "the notions of tangent cone and direction set have taken a very important role in the study of several equisingularity type problems , in particular , after the pioneering works of h. whitney @xcite , to the topological equisingularity problem .",
    "for instance , i. nakai discussed and used directional properties in @xcite in order to show the appearance of topological moduli in a family of polynomial map - germs : @xmath1 for @xmath2 , @xmath3 . on the other hand , the authors showed in @xcite that the dimension of the common direction set of two subanalytic subsets , called the _ directional dimension _ ,",
    "is preserved by a bi - lipschitz homeomorphism provided that their images are also subanalytic . in order to prove this result we introduced and employed in an essential way the notion of sequence selection property ( ( ssp ) for short ) .",
    "( ssp ) is a notion based on the direction set .",
    "it takes an important role in the study of lipschitz equisingularity . using the aforementioned theorem in @xcite",
    ", we can see that the oka family @xcite is not lipschitz trivial as a family of zero - sets of real polynomial function germs .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the geometry of sets satisfying ( ssp ) , their behaviour under bi - lipschitz transformations and to point out applications to complex singularities and also other fields .    in order to do this ,",
    "we introduce the notions of transversality and weak transversality , using the real cone ( half - cone ) of the direction set , essential tools for understanding the sets satisfying condition ( ssp ) .",
    "our main concern is to decide under which conditions the transversality of sets is preserved by ( bi - lipschitz ) homeomorphisms . in particular",
    "we show that the transversality for complex analytic sets is preserved by bi - lipschitz homeomorphisms ( theorem 3.2 ) , provided that their images are also complex analytic sets , and that the weak transversality for general sets is preserved by bi - lipschitz homeomorphisms , provided that one of them and its image satisfy the sequence selection property ( theorems 3.5 and 3.11 ) .",
    "in fact the weak transversality is preserved for arbitrary sets if the bi - lipschitz homeomorphism satisfies the condition semiline-(ssp ) , simply a corollary of theorem 2.25 .",
    "in addition , we introduce and study the notion of ( ssp ) mappings .",
    "we show that the ( ssp ) structure is preserved by ( ssp ) bi - lipschitz homeomorphisms ( theorem 4.7 ) . in general the behaviour of a merely bi - lipschitz homeomorphism",
    "can be very wild in respect to the direction sets .",
    "we show that whenever a bi - lipschitz homeomorphism is also an ( ssp ) mapping , this is no longer the case .",
    "indeed , we are able to control this behaviour by either considering it in regard to sets satisfying condition ( ssp ) or by considering bi - lipschitz homeomorphisms endowed with extra properties . in particular , we look for those homeomorphisms with a good directional behaviour and we single out two large classes of examples .",
