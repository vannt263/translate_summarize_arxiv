    "the bl - lac object mkn 501 showed strong and frequent flaring in 1997 . the source has been observed by many different experiments using imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) .",
    "here we report on observations with the hegra stand - alone telescopes ct1 and ct2 while observations with the hegra ct system are reported in part i of this paper ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite , subsequently _",
    "part i _ ) .    from march 11 to october 20 , 1997",
    "the source was monitored every night whenever weather and background light permitted it .",
    "a fraction of the observations was carried out by up to 6 telescopes .    a detailed discussion of mkn 501 and its history of @xmath2-emission is given in part i , as well as the details of the stereo - mode observations with 4 telescopes , the related analysis methods , the stereo - mode results and some comparisons of the stereo - mode data with rxte observations .",
    "the data from the stand alone telescopes ct1 and ct2 are less precise than the system data as energy and angular resolution are somewhat worse .",
    "nevertheless they complement th ct system data as significantly longer observations were carried out . due to additional observations made under the presence of moonlight the lightcurve of ct1",
    "is the most complete of all observations in 1997 .",
    "this paper has the following structure : section 2 summarizes the relevant telescope parameters of ct1 and ct2 and important performance data .",
    "the details of the observations and data analysis are presented in section 3 together with the combined lightcurve . for the comparison with lower energy data from rxte",
    "we include hegra observations from 1996 .",
    "the ct2 data analysis is presented in section 4 .",
    "the combined lightcurve , specific details and conclusions are discussed in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "the hegra collaboration is operating six imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes for gamma astronomy as part of its cosmic ray detector complex at the observatory roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma ( 28.75@xmath3 n , 17.89@xmath3 w , 2200 m a.s.l . , see e.g. lindner et al .",
    "@xcite ) . while the first two telescopes ( ct1 and ct2 ) are operated in stand - alone mode , the other four ( ct3 , 4 , 5 and 6 ) are run as a system of telescopes in order to achieve stereoscopic observations of the air - showers .",
    "hegra ct1 was commissioned in august 1992 . in its 1997 configuration ,",
    "ct1 had a mirror made up of 18 spherical round glass mirrors of 5 m focal length and a total mirror area of 5 m@xmath4 .",
    "the photomultiplier ( pm ) camera of ct1 consists of 127 3/4@xmath5 emi tubes 9083a in a hexagonally dense package with an angular diameter of @xmath6 ( individual pixel diameter : @xmath7 ) .",
    "the tracking accuracy of ct1 is better than 0.1@xmath3 .",
    "the telescope hardware is described in detail in mirzoyan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and rauterberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .      during the 1997 observing period",
    ", ct1 was run with a range of slightly different high voltage settings for the pm camera :    during dark nights , two settings were used : before 29th of april the settings from previous years had been used which we name hv1 in this paper . after the 29th of april , the high voltages were increased by @xmath8% in order to compensate for pm dynode aging effects and to lower the energy threshold of the telescope to below its pre-1996 value .",
    "this second setting we denote by hv2 .    soon after the beginning of the 1997 observing period , the strong variability of mkn 501 made it obvious that it was of great importance to dedicate as much observation time as possible to the source .",
    "until recently , it was believed that cherenkov telescopes can only operate during moonless nights due to the increase in pm current and noise caused by the general increase in background light .",
    "as our studies with ct1 show , this limitation can be largely overcome by fast amplifiers with ac coupling to low - gain pm cameras for which the high voltage is reduced by several percent compared to the optimal setting for moonless nights .",
    "the used voltage reduction increases the telescopes threshold by a factor up to 2.6 , but observations of strong gamma sources can still give useful results .",
    "details of the observation in the presence of moonlight are given in raubenheimer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "ct1 has observed mkn 501 for nearly 7 months whenever the weather fulfilled the standard observing conditions and the source was at zenith angles below @xmath9 .",
    "the additional observations under the presence of moonlight make the lightcurve obtained from ct1 the most complete one compared to all other 1997 light curves of this source in the tev energy range .",
    "the moonlight observations were taken with four different pm voltage settings : hv1 and hv2 as described above and settings with voltage reduced by 10% and 14% relative to hv2 .",
    "the latter settings are named hv3 and hv4 .",
    "nearly all the data taken under the presence of moonlight were taken with the settings hv1 and hv2 .",
    "hv4 was used only for observations close to the nearly full moon .",
    "the second hegra cherenkov telescope , ct2 , was built in 1993 and has been observing in an essentially unchanged configuration since 1994 .",
    "ct2 is located at 93 m distance from ct1 , i.e.   some of the showers are seen simultaneously by both telescopes when operated at the same time .",
    "nevertheless , we treat the observations as independent ones .",
    "ct2 was the prototype for the hegra cherenkov telescope system .",
    "as opposed to the equatorially mounted ct1 , it has an alt - az mount .",
    "the mirror elements are again round glass mirrors of 60 cm @xmath10 and 5 m focal length , but 30 instead of 18 are used which give ct2 a mirror area of 8.5 m@xmath4 and thus a lower energy threshold compared to ct1 .    in 1997",
    "ct2 was still operated with its original 61 pixel camera with a field of view of 3.7@xmath3 and an angular diameter of the individual pixel of 0.43@xmath3 .",
    "studies of the trigger rate as a function of trigger threshold showed that the performance of the telescope has not noticeably changed since 1995 and that the nominal energy threshold of 1 tev for primary gammas is still valid .",
    "the telescope is described in wiedner ( @xcite ) and petry ( @xcite ) .",
    "table [ param - tab ] summarizes some essential parameters of the telescopes .",
    "most of the parameters were determined experimentally while some were calculated from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . for the mc simulations we used the computational code developed by konopelko ( @xcite ) .",
    "this program includes the losses of cherenkov light due to atmospheric effects , i.e.  rayleigh and mie scattering , as well as the telescope parameters such as spectral mirror reflectivity , pm quantum efficiency etc .",
    "the simulations took into account the imperfections of the telescope optics and the differences in the ct1 pm noise for the different night sky background ( nsb ) conditions , e.g.  due to the presence of moonlight .",
    "the relation between photoelectrons and measured quantities , i.e. , the adc conversion factor , has been determined by a separate experiment in 1995/96 for the hv setting hv1 , i.e.  before the dynode aging . for the other hv settings of ct1",
    "the related change in conversion factors has been calculated from the hv - gain characteristics of the pms , which were found to be in excellent agreement with the change of trigger rate ( after subtracting noise triggers ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in fig .  [ fig - lightcurve ] the lightcurve from all hegra cts is shown for an energy threshold of 1.5 tev .",
    "the observations with ct1 under the presence of moonlight are indicated separately .",
    "the errors are purely statistical .",
    "in general we see good agreement between the data from the three instruments . restricting the comparison to",
    "directly overlapping days we obtain the following ratio between the fluxes @xmath11 and @xmath12 the overlap times were 110 h , 60 h and 65 h , respectively .",
    "the seemingly small inconsistency in the ratios has its origin in different overlap times and different zenith angles .",
    "the ratios agree well within the systematic errors , which are in the order of 30% .",
    "the systematic error is in part global and in part quite different for each instrument .",
    "there are 5 data points where the disagreement between simultaneous observations with different telescopes differ by more than 4 @xmath13 ( mjd 50579 , 50580 , 50582 , 50607 , 50658 ) after normalizing the fluxes to the respective mean fluxes .",
    "these large differences are for the time being unexplainable .",
    "part of the difference might be due to source variability and different observation times in compared nights but some of the discrepancies remain even for exactly matching on time slices .    here",
    "we would like to comment on various features of the lightcurve .    1 .",
    "the largest flare was observed at mjd 50626 - 27 with a flux above 1.5 tev of @xmath14 @xmath15 sec@xmath16 .",
    "other experiments , whipple and cat , have observed a large and short flare on april 16th ( mjd 50554 ) . due to complete cloud coverage",
    ", hegra could not observe that .",
    "the deferred analysis of the data taken at large zenith angles will add about 15% more data points on the light curve as well as reducing some of the errors of the shown data points .",
    "the data point at mjd 50526 is less reliable because observations were carried out during strong and gusty winds .",
    "the visibility at mjd 50697 was at the allowed limit , therefore this flux value may have to be corrected .",
    "a detailed time structure analysis including also the data from large zenith angle observations ( including observations under moonlight ) is in preparation and will be published elsewhere .",
    "no ct1/2 entries are shown after mjd 50721 because of modest statistics below 38@xmath3 zenith angle .",
    "the long period of intense flaring of mkn 501 provided the unusual opportunity    * to obtain a large and relatively clean sample of vhe @xmath2-rays , * to carry out a detailed analysis of the spectral distribution and the lightcurve over a duration of nearly seven months , * to carry out multi - wavelength observations , * to compare the highly variable @xmath2 emission with that observed in previous years and also with that of other agns , * to test the detector performance by comparing data taken at the same time with nearby telescopes and in other experiments .",
    "most of the conclusions have already been presented in part i. here we concentrate on a comparison of data taken with the different hegra cts and results related mainly to increased density of nightly samplings and outline some future analysis prospects which will require additional measurements .    the data of ct1 and 2 presented here are for about half the time overlapping with the ct system observation periods , while the other half fills many gaps , dominantly during moonlit nights , but normally ct1 was also observing 30%-50% longer during dark nights .",
    "nevertheless , even during identical times and given the fact that ct1 is basically centered to the system , not only identical events have been recorded .",
    "this is due to the collection area of the ct system being about 2 1/2 times larger than that of ct1 .",
    "also , due to the larger cameras and better precision on the impact parameter calculation , one could record with the ct system showers where one `` sees '' only shower halo particles , i.e. , from showers with an impact distance between 130 - 200 m. due to the different readout concept , 8 bit fadc readout of the ct system and 10 respectively 11 bit charge sensitive gated adcs of the stand - alone telescopes , the saturation effects for multi - tev showers are different .",
    "also it should be mentioned that we used different mc programs for the standalone ct1/ct2 and the system .",
    "in addition we used quite different procedures for the @xmath2 selection .",
    "in spite of these differences we see in general excellent agreement in the structure of the lightcurve of the data recorded with the different instruments . in general , we see a better agreement between ct1 and ct2 data although their direct event overlap is smaller than that between the ct system and ct1 observations .",
    "the flux values from ct1 are systematically lower compared to the ct system data by about 27% . for the time being we are unable to decide whether this is related to the very different analysis methods or due to the systematic errors in the photon to adc signal conversion ratio .",
    "we observe good agreement of the spectral shape from the observations with the different telescopes .",
    "[ all_spec ] shows a comparative plot where we combined the two resp .",
    "three zenith angle ranges of ct1 and ct2 .",
    "obviously , an unbroken power law will not describe the data well , except for the limited energy range of the ct1 data ( see section [ sec - ct1spec ] ) .",
    "an ansatz with an exponential cutoff @xmath17 yielded : +   + for ct1 :   @xmath18 + with a reduced  @xmath19 ( fit to the data points of fig .",
    "[ fig - ct1spec ] ) +   + for ct2 :   @xmath20 + with a reduced  @xmath21 ( fit to the data points of fig .",
    "[ fig - ct2spec ] ) +   + the fit to the preliminary data of the hegra iact system in the energy region from 1.25 tev to 24 tev ( krawczynski @xcite ) gives :    for ct system : @xmath22 + it should be noted that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are highly correlated , i.e. , a modestly more curved spectrum enforces both a lower @xmath23 and lower e@xmath25 in the fit .",
    "this is particularly obvious for the ct2 data .",
    "the difference in the three sets of @xmath23 and e@xmath25 is explaineable by the different range of the fit .",
    "if we fit the ct2 spectrum unsing the system @xmath23 of 1.81 we obtain an @xmath26 and a marginally worse reduced  @xmath27 of 1.71 .",
    "the observed steepening of the spectrum could be either due to an inherent change in the acceleration and interaction process or due to @xmath2-interaction with the cosmic ir background .",
    "a detailed study of the spectra will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "other tests of the existence of an ir absorption have been proposed by aharonian ( @xcite ) and plaga ( @xcite ) , namely the production of pair halos and time delay of secondary @xmath2s .",
    "the `` halo ''",
    "@xmath2s should show up predominantly at larger alpha values and should not show the rapid variation of the main @xmath2 flux at all .",
    "another aspect is that , depending on the onset of the ir absorption , the spectrum of the halo @xmath2s should be much softer resp .",
    "have a lower energy cutoff .",
    "the effect should be quite visible in the 1 - 10 tev region if strong ir absorption occurs above 25 - 35 tev .",
    "we searched for such effects using data between 10@xmath3 to 20@xmath3 in alpha but no conclusive results could be drawn due to insufficient statistics .",
    "one of the problems is that improvements in the source position resolution due to higher energy can fake a soft halo spectrum .",
    "also the wide spread of the prediction for the extragalactic magnetic field make such an analysis difficult .    due to the large number of ct1 daily flux measurements a precise comparison with the nearly continuous rxte data is possible .",
    "the correlation of 0.61 @xmath28 0.06 between the ct1/2 data and the rxte data gives a rather strong evidence of a coupled effect such as electron acceleration and inverse compton scattering on synchroton radiation generated photons .",
    "close inspection of the data show that around mjd 50580 the structure of the lightcurve in the tev range differs significantly from that at the 2 - 10 kev range .",
    "while observing significant flaring in the tev range , the kev lightcurve remaines constant within errors .",
    "if we exclude the data between mjd 50568 and 50590 the correlation rises to @xmath29 while inside the range it drops to @xmath30 .",
    "the assumption of the electron acceleration gets further support from the about quadratic rise of tev @xmath2 flux as compared to the kev flux rise from 1996 to 1997 , see section [ sec - rxtecorr ]",
    ". clearly , a long term observation of the kev - tev correlation over a few years should give further support or disprove the concept of electron acceleration dominance .",
    "hadronic components and/or a significant change in electron acceleration can not be ruled out , see our comment on the observation around mjd 50580 .",
    "note that the 1996 mkn 501 data , originally showing a 5.8 @xmath13 excess ( bradbury et al .",
    "@xcite ) , have been reanalysed using the dynamical supercuts also used in this paper .",
    "the excess increased to @xmath31 while the flux values and the integral spectrum remained the same ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "comparing the 1996 and the 1997 spectrum , however , we find indications that the curvature of the spectrum has increased since the increase in flux from 1996 to 1997 is lower at higher energies .",
    "a detailed comparison between the spectra in 1996 and 1997 will be presented in a later paper .",
    "finally , we want to comment on a technical conclusion drawn from the analysis . for precision measurements it is important to use a larger camera diameter compared to the one of ct1 .",
    "a larger camera would have resulted in a significantly better energy and angular resolution at higher energies .",
    "the hegra collaboration thanks the instituto de astrofisica de canarias and the town of garafia for use of the site and the excellent working conditions .",
    "also we acknowledge the rapid availability of the rxte data and the atmospheric extinction data from the camc .",
