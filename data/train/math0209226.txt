    "all of these winding numbers can vanish , and in such cases , we will say that @xmath10 _ projects to zero on @xmath2_.    for instance , if we embed the round circle @xmath13 into a horizontal plane in @xmath14 , it projects to zero on any vertical 2-plane ; the projection `` cancels itself '' by traversing a single line segment once in each direction ( figure 1a ) .",
