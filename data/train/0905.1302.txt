    "this paper concerns homeomorphisms of a compact oriented surface  @xmath3 to itself .",
    "there are natural equivalence classes of such homeomorphisms under isotopy , called isotopy classes or mapping classes .",
    "an irreducible mapping class is such that no power of its members preserves a nontrivial subsurface . by the thurston  nielsen classification  @xcite , irreducible mapping classes are either finite - order or are of a type called pseudo - anosov .",
    "the class of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms is by far the richest .",
    "one can think of such a homeomorphism @xmath4 as an anosov ( or hyperbolic ) homeomorphism on @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , as for standard anosov on the two dimensional torus , there exists a local euclidean structure ( with singularities ) and two linear foliations ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , called stable and unstable ) such that @xmath4 expands the leaves of one foliation with a coefficient @xmath8 , and shrinks those of the other foliation with the same coefficient .",
    "the number  @xmath8 is a topological invariant called the _ dilatation _ of @xmath4 ; the number @xmath9 is the _ topological entropy _ of @xmath4 .",
    "thurston proved that @xmath10 is an algebraic integer ( in fact , it is a perron number ) over @xmath11 of degree bounded by @xmath12 . in particular newton s formulas",
    "imply that for each @xmath13 the set of dilatations bounded from above by a constant is finite .",
    "hence the minimum value @xmath14 of the dilatation of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms on @xmath3 is well defined  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the logarithm of  @xmath14 is the length of the shortest geodesics on the moduli space of complex curves of genus @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( for the teichmller metric ) .",
    "two natural questions arise .",
    "the first is how to compute @xmath14 explicitly for small @xmath17 .",
    "the second question asks if there is a unique ( up to conjugacy ) pseudo - anosov homeomorphism with minimum dilatation in the modular group mod@xmath18 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath19 and this dilatation is uniquely realized by the conjugacy class in mod@xmath20 of the matrix @xmath21 . in principle these dilatations can be computed for any given @xmath15 using train tracks . of course actually carrying out this procedure , even for small values of @xmath15 , seems impractical .",
    "we know very little about the value of the constants  @xmath14 . using a computer and train tracks techniques for the punctured disc , cho and ham",
    "@xcite proved that @xmath22 is equal to the largest root of the polynomial @xmath23 , @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "one of the results of the present paper is an independent and elementary proof of this fact .",
    "one can also ask about the uniqueness ( up to conjugacy ) of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms that realize @xmath14 . in genus @xmath25 , @xmath22 is not unique due to the existence of the hyperelliptic involution and covering transformations ( see section  [ sec : genus2 ] and remark  [ rem : unicity ] for a precise definition ) .",

    "we can easily show that the lefschetz numbers are consistent for arbitrary iterate .",
    "it turns out that we can construct a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism having this dilatation .",
    "we use the same approach as in section  [ sec : g3dehn ] to find the candidate word .",
    "there exists a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism on a genus @xmath37 surface , stabilizing orientable foliations , and having for dilatation the perron root of the polynomial @xmath38 .",
    "let us consider the sequence of dehn twists @xmath39 its action on homology has  @xmath40 as a characteristic polynomial . since  @xmath38 is irreducible and has no roots that are also roots of unity  @xcite , then by theorem  [ thm : construction : pa ] the homeomorphism is isotopic to a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism , say @xmath41 .",
    "we compute the dilatation of @xmath41 by calculating the action on the fundamental group , which shows that the dilatation is the perron root of the polynomial @xmath38 .",
    "hence ,  @xmath41 must also stabilize a pair of orientable foliations , and it realizes our systole  @xmath42 .",
    "this time there is a known candidate with a lower dilatation than hironaka & kin s  @xcite : leininger s pseudo - anosov homeomorphism  @xcite having lehmer s number  @xmath44 as a dilatation .",
    "this pseudo - anosov homeomorphism has invariant foliations corresponding to stratum  @xmath45 .",
    "( the lefschetz numbers are also compatible with stratum  @xmath46 . )",
    "the polynomial associated with its action on homology has  @xmath47 .",
    "an exhaustive search ( see appendix  [ sec : smallp ] ) leads us to conclude that there is no allowable polynomial with a lower dilatation , so there is nothing else to check .",
    "as we finished this paper we learned that aaber & dunfield  @xcite have found a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism with dilatation lower than  @xmath48 ( stabilizing a non - orientable foliation ) , implying that  @xmath49 .      for genus 6",
    ", we have demonstrated that the lefschetz numbers associated with  @xmath51 , with  @xmath52 the polynomial in table  [ tab : thm : lower ] , are compatible with stratum  @xmath53 , with lehmer s number as a root ( lehmer s polynomial is a factor ) .",
    "( there is another polynomial with the same dilatation that is compatible with the stratum  @xmath54 . )",
    "we have not yet constructed an explicit pseudo - anosov homeomorphism with this dilatation for genus 6 , so theorem  [ thm : lower ] is a weaker form than  [ thm:1 ] : it only asserts that  @xmath55 is not less than this dilatation .",
    "note , however , that whether or not this pseudo - anosov homeomorphism exists this is the first instance where the minimum dilatation is not lower than for smaller genus .",
    "again , we have not constructed the pseudo - anosov homeomorphism explicitly , but the lefschetz numbers for the polynomial  @xmath51 , with  @xmath52 as in table [ tab : thm : lower ] , are compatible with stratum  @xmath57 .",
    "as we finished this paper we learned that aaber & dunfield  @xcite and kin & takasawa  @xcite have found a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism with dilatation equal to the systole  @xmath58 .",
    "genus eight is roughly the limit of this brute - force approach : it takes our computer program about five days to ensure that we have the minimizing polynomial .",
    "the bound described in appendix  [ sec : smallp ] yields  @xmath60 cases for the traces , most of which do not correspond to integer - coefficient polynomials .    yet",
    "again , we have not constructed the pseudo - anosov homeomorphism explicitly , but the lefschetz numbers for the polynomial  @xmath51 , with  @xmath52 as in table  [ tab : thm : lower ] , are compatible with stratum  @xmath61 .",
    "as we finished this paper we learned that hironaka  @xcite has found a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism with dilatation equal to the systole  @xmath62 .",
    "examining the cases with even  @xmath15 leads to a natural question :    is the minimum value of the dilatation of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms on a genus @xmath15 surface , for @xmath15 even , with orientable invariant foliations , equal to the largest root of the polynomial  @xmath63 ?",
    "[ conj : systoleeven ]",
    "the crucial task in our proofs is to find all reciprocal polynomials with a largest real root bounded by a given value  @xmath64 ( typically the candidate minimum dilatation ) .",
    "moreover , these must be allowable polynomials for a pseudo - anosov homeomorphism : the largest root ( in absolute value ) must be real and strictly larger than all other roots , and it must be outside the unit circle in the complex plane .    the simplest way to find all such polynomials is to bound the coefficients directly .",
    "for example , in genus 3 , if we denote an arbitrary reciprocal polynomial by @xmath65 , we want to find all polynomials with perron root smaller than @xmath66 ( the candidate minimum dilatation at the beginning of section  [ sec : proof : g3 ] ) . let @xmath67 ; a straightforward calculation assuming that half the roots of  @xmath68 are equal to  @xmath64 shows @xmath69 plugging in numbers , this means @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72",
    ". allowing for @xmath73 since we only care about the absolute value of the largest root , we have a total of  @xmath74 cases to examine . out of these",
    ", only two polynomials actually have a root small enough and satisfy the other constraints ( reality , uniqueness of largest root ) , as given in section  [ sec : proof : g3 ] .",
    "the problem with this straightforward approach ( also employed by cho and ham for genus 2 , see  @xcite ) is that it scales very poorly with increasing genus . for genus",
    "@xmath37 , the number of cases is @xmath75 ; for genus  @xmath1 , we have @xmath76 cases ( we use for  @xmath64 the dilatation of hironaka & kin s pseudo - anosov homeomorphism  @xcite , currently the best general upper bound on  @xmath14 ) . as  @xmath15 increases , the target dilatation  @xmath64 decreases , which should limit the number of cases , but the quantity  @xmath67 converges to unity , and the bound depends only weakly on  @xmath77 .",
    "an improved approach is to start from newton s formulas relating the traces to the coefficients : for a polynomial  @xmath78 which is the characteristic polynomial of a matrix  @xmath3 , we have @xmath79 for a reciprocal polynomial , we have  @xmath80 .",
    "we can use these formulas to solve for the  @xmath81 given the first few traces  @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 is even in this paper ) .",
    "we also have    [ lem : trbound ] if the characteristic polynomial  @xmath68 of a matrix  @xmath3 has a largest eigenvalue with absolute value  @xmath86 , then @xmath87 furthermore , if  @xmath68 is reciprocal and of even degree , then @xmath88    obviously , @xmath89 where  @xmath90 are the eigenvalues of  @xmath3 .",
    "if the polynomial is reciprocal and  @xmath85 is even , then @xmath91    we now have the following prescription for enumerating allowable polynomials , given  @xmath85 and a largest root  @xmath64 :    1 .",
    "use lemma  [ lem : trbound ] to bound the traces @xmath92 , @xmath93 ; 2 .",
    "[ item : step2 ] for each possible set of  @xmath94 traces , solve for the coefficients of the polynomial ; 3 .",
    "[ item : step3 ] if these coefficients are not all integers , move on to the next possible set of traces ; 4 .   if the coefficients are integers , check if the polynomial is allowable : largest eigenvalue real and with absolute value less than  @xmath64 , outside the unit circle , and nondegenerate ; 5 .",
    "repeat step  [ item : step2 ] until we run out of possible values for the traces .",
    "let s compare with the earlier numbers for  @xmath43 : assuming  @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 cases to try , which is already a factor of  @xmath97 fewer than with the coefficient bound .",
    "moreover , of these  @xmath98 lead to fractional coefficients , and so are discarded in step  [ item : step3 ] above .",
    "this only leaves  @xmath99 cases , roughly a factor of  @xmath100 fewer than with the coefficient bound .",
    "hence , with this simple approach we can tackle polynomials up to degree  @xmath101 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "more refined approaches will certainly allow higher degrees to be reached .    a final note on the numerical technique : we use newton s iterative method to check the dominant root of candidate polynomials .",
    "a nice feature of polynomials with a dominant real root is that their graph is strictly convex upwards for  @xmath102 greater than the root ( when that root is positive , otherwise for  @xmath102 less than the root ) .",
    "hence , newton s method is guaranteed to converge rapidly and uniquely for appropriate initial guess ( typically , 5 iterates is enough for about 6 significant figures ) .",
    "if the method does _ not _ converge quickly , then the polynomial is ruled out .",
    "another approach is to use the mahler measure of a polynomial .",
    "if @xmath52 is a degree @xmath2 monic polynomial that admits a perron root , say @xmath64 , then the mahler measure of @xmath52 satisfies @xmath103 .",
    "thus to list all possible polynomials with a perron root less than a constant @xmath64 , we just have to list all possible polynomials with a mahler measure less than @xmath104 .",
    "such lists already exist in the literature ( for example in  @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we recall very briefly the basic construction of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms using the rauzy  veech induction ( for details see  @xcite ,  8 , and @xcite ) .",
    "we will use this to construct the minimizing pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms in genus  @xmath105 and  @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath106 be an open interval and let us choose a finite partition of @xmath107 into @xmath108 open subintervals @xmath109 .",
    "an interval exchange map is a one - to - one map @xmath110 from @xmath107 to itself that permutes , by translation , the subintervals @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath110 is precisely determined by a permutation @xmath112 that encodes how the intervals are exchanged , and a vector @xmath113 with positive entries that encodes the lengths of the intervals .",

    "let @xmath130 be the horizontal interval defined by @xmath131 .",
