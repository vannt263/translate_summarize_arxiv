    "in this paper we describe certain  self - similar \" solutions to the initial value problem associated to the free schrdinger equation : @xmath0 a straightforward application of the fourier transform allows us express the solution @xmath1 of as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fourier transform of @xmath4 . as usual , we denote this solution by @xmath5 .    in section 2",
    "we describe in detail the particular solutions that we have in mind , and in section 3 we give applications to two established problems in harmonic analysis and the theory of schrdinger equations . these problems concern weighted estimates for solutions to in two variants , and are related to the restriction / extension operators for the base of the paraboloid .      for non - negative quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 we use @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) to denote the existence of a positive constant @xmath10 , depending on at most @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we write @xmath14 if both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the function of one variable @xmath17 note that @xmath18 is simply the characteristic function of a union of disjoint , equally spaced subintervals of @xmath19 $ ] of equal size .",
    "we take as initial data in @xmath4 such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding solution of the free schrdinger equation is given by @xmath22 we wish to identify a set @xmath23 upon which @xmath24 is  large \" . in order to achieve this",
    "we look for points @xmath25 for which there is essentially no cancellation in the above integrals ; i.e. for which the phases @xmath26 are within a small ( say @xmath27 ) neighbourhood of @xmath28 for all @xmath29 and @xmath30 . by the product structure of , it suffices to consider the integral @xmath31 where @xmath32 .    if @xmath33 , then @xmath34 for some positive integer @xmath35 and @xmath36 . now consider @xmath37 of the form @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . for such @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "we have @xmath44 since @xmath45 , we are interested in the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 for which @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a positive constant , such as @xmath50 say .",
    "as is easily verified , holds precisely when @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and hence for such @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath53    we now define @xmath54 , and @xmath55 hence by , @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "now since @xmath5 may be viewed as the fourier transform of a certain compactly supported measure on @xmath58 , this estimate continues to hold for @xmath25 belonging to an @xmath59 neighbourhood of @xmath60 .",
    "we denote this union of @xmath59-balls by @xmath61 ( see figure [ omega ] ) .",
    "we notice that for @xmath42 belonging to the projection of @xmath61 onto the @xmath42-axis , @xmath62 , so that the mass of @xmath63 on the section through @xmath61 at height @xmath42 accounts for a positive proportion of its total mass at height @xmath42 .",
    "we now consider a succession of such examples of increasing complexity .",
    "suppose now that @xmath64 is such that @xmath65 is an integer , and let @xmath66 be fixed .",
    "( we allow the implicit constants in the @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 notation to depend on @xmath70 . )",
    "consider the function of one variable @xmath71 note that @xmath72 is  self - similar \" in the sense that for @xmath73 , @xmath72 may be written as a certain linear combination of rescaled and translated copies of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 coincides with the function @xmath18 defined in .    as before we take as initial data in @xmath76 such that @xmath77 where @xmath78 the corresponding solution of the free schrdinger equation is given by @xmath79    as before it suffices to consider the integral @xmath80 where @xmath32 .    if @xmath33 , then @xmath81 for some positive integers @xmath82 and latexmath:[$    @xmath37 of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "for such @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 we have @xmath86 in order for the above expression for the phase to belong to a small ( say @xmath27 ) neighbourhood of @xmath87 , it suffices for each of the summands to either be integers , or be bounded in absolute value by a sufficiently small constant ( depending only on @xmath70 ) .",
    "as before , this places size restrictions on the integers @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it is here where we use the fact that @xmath65 is an integer .",
    "we now define @xmath90 and @xmath91 to be an @xmath59-neighbourhood of @xmath92 arguing as before we find that @xmath93 whenever @xmath94 .",
    "we note a further  self - similarity \" in the family of sets @xmath95 .",
    "observe that for @xmath96 , @xmath95 is a disjoint union of rescaled and translated copies of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 coincides with the set @xmath60 defined previously .",
    "the above examples may be generalised substantially by choosing the family of functions @xmath72 to be self - similar with respect to more general families of affine transformations that in particular may depend on the index @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be a bounded hypersurface in @xmath101 with everywhere non - vanishing gaussian curvature ( for instance , @xmath100 could be the base of a paraboloid or a small portion of the unit sphere @xmath102 ) . if we denote by @xmath103 the induced lebesgue measure on @xmath100 , then we may define the _ extension operator associated to @xmath100 _ to be the mapping @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "there has recently been considerable interest in studying weighted @xmath108 inequalities for the extension operator which take the general form @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a positive measure supported on the unit ball @xmath111 of @xmath58 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 is a suitable rate - of - decay exponent and @xmath114 is a constant depending only on @xmath110 .",
    "see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a specific instance of this type of inequality , which is of particular interest in geometric measure theory , concerns the relation between the exponents @xmath115 and @xmath116 such that for each @xmath100 there exists a constant @xmath10 ( depending on @xmath100 , @xmath113 and @xmath117 ) for which @xmath118 holds for all @xmath119 , all @xmath112 and all borel measures @xmath110 supported in @xmath111 .",
    "in particular , for each @xmath120 it is of interest to determine the exponent @xmath121 which is defined to be the supremum of the numbers @xmath113 for which holds for some constant @xmath10 . in two dimensions",
    "it is known that @xmath122 we note that this piecewise linear function was originally computed for @xmath123 .",
    "it is however implicit in the arguments given in @xcite and @xcite that the same is true for general @xmath100 of the type discussed here .",
    "in higher dimensions it is well known that @xmath124 for @xmath125 ( mattila @xcite ) , and that @xmath126 ( sjlin @xcite ) . however , for @xmath127 the currently known upper and lower bounds for @xmath121 do not coincide .",
    "lower bounds in this region were obtained by sjlin @xcite and bourgain @xcite , and those of @xcite have been improved recently by erdo@xmath128an @xcite .",
    "examples leading to upper bounds were also observed by mattila @xcite , sjlin @xcite , katz and tao @xcite and more recently by iosevich and rudnev @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to improve these upper bounds further by using our special solutions to the schrdinger equation from section 2 by showing that the graph of @xmath121 does not lie above the line segment joining the points @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "it is important to point out that we give upper bounds for the general problem by construction of examples on a particular hypersurface , the paraboloid .",
    "these examples do not appear to extend in a routine manner to general hypersurfaces , or even to the specific case of the sphere @xmath123 , due to number - theoretic issues .",
    "the case of the sphere is the principal interest of @xcite as it relates to the classical distance set conjecture of falconer @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath100 to be the section of the paraboloid @xmath133 and observe that @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 . now by plancherel s theorem , inequality may be written as @xmath137 and so we may test on functions @xmath4 of the form with @xmath138 .",
    "for such a function @xmath139 for all @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is an @xmath142 neighbourood of @xmath143 and @xmath144 notice that @xmath145 .",
    "it is conceivable that the upper bound of proposition [ upperbound ] may be improved by considering the more sophisticated special solutions of the schrdinger equation described at the end of section 2 , but we do not pursue this point further .",
    "we note that the examples of section 2 furnish explicit necessary conditions on the functional @xmath114 so that an inequality of the form might hold for some given @xmath151 .",
    "these conditions are not simply upper bounds on how much mass @xmath110 can put on various eccentric tubes , but instead on how much mass can be put on various _ arrangements _ of eccentric tubes dictated by the set @xmath61 and its variants . on the other hand , if we take for example @xmath152 , and we demand validity of for _ all _ @xmath153 then the examples we present here offer no further necessary conditions than do the  simple \" examples where the testing function is essentially the characteristic function of a _ single _ product of intervals .      the stein",
    "tomas restriction theorem ( see @xcite ) , in its equivalent dual form , states that for @xmath154 , there is a constant @xmath10 for which @xmath155 for all @xmath156 . this estimate may be viewed using duality as the weighted estimate @xmath157 whenever @xmath158 and @xmath159 .    in @xcite ruiz and vega considered ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for @xmath160 )",
    "extending by replacing the @xmath161 norm of @xmath162 by certain _ morrey  campanato",
    "these norms play a role in the theory of unique continuation ",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the morrey ",
    "campanato classes , which are denoted by @xmath163 , for @xmath164 and @xmath165 , are given by @xmath166 where @xmath167 notice that @xmath168 we also remark that for @xmath169 the class @xmath163 contains the lorentz space @xmath170 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath171 , it is natural to think of @xmath162 as a measure @xmath110 rather than a locally @xmath172 function , and then @xmath173 ( similar to what was considered in the previous subsection ) .",
    "the proof given by ruiz and vega in @xcite was for the case @xmath180 , but all the estimates used go through in the more general case of nonvanishing gaussian curvature .",
    "there are three  endpoint \" cases @xmath181 and @xmath182 respectively .",
    "the first of these is the stein ",
    "tomas restriction theorem , the second corresponds to a rescaled version of mattila s result ( @xcite ) that @xmath124 for @xmath183 which was discussed in the previous subsection , and the third is trivial .",
    "( the key difficulty to be overcome in @xcite was the failure of the morrey ",
    "campanato spaces to interpolate nicely ; see also @xcite . )      in the first place , a straightforward modification of the standard ",
    "knapp \" counterexample provides the following necessary condition for @xmath185 this condition gives optimal results in dimensions @xmath186 with the possible exception of the line @xmath187 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the characteristic function of a @xmath190-cell on @xmath100 ; then @xmath191 , while @xmath192 on a tube of sides @xmath193 .",
    "take @xmath162 to be the characteristic function of this tube .",
    "then @xmath194 \\displaystyle \\delta^{-2\\alpha+\\frac{n-1}{p}}&{\\rm if}\\ \\frac{1}{p}\\le \\frac{\\alpha}{n-1}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]      these standard examples only have significance when @xmath195 . as we shall now see , for @xmath196 and @xmath197",
    ", the special solutions introduced in section [ especiales ] provide us with further necessary conditions .",
    "as in the previous subsection , this will be achieved by taking @xmath100 to be a bounded subset of the paraboloid .",
    "( again , we point out that these examples do not appear to extend in a routine manner to other curved submanifolds of the type we consider . )      as we did in , we can write @xmath200 where @xmath135 and @xmath201 and therefore , inequality may be written as @xmath202 taking @xmath4 as in and @xmath162 as the characteristic function of the set @xmath61 defined in section ( see figure [ omega ] ) , we have that @xmath203 on the other hand , @xmath204 for @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath190 small and positive we have @xmath207 from , and , and the fact that @xmath206 we see that a necessary condition for to hold is @xmath208      we shall address the analogous questions for the full paraboloid  i.e. the initial value problem for the schrdinger equation where the initial data @xmath4 is not assumed to have fourier transform with compact support  in a forthcoming paper . as a consequence of those results",
