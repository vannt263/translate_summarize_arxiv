    "moreover , it has been suggested  @xcite that we can realize artificial gravitational systems in laboratory by irradiating off - resonant laser beam onto atoms in a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "theoretically , long - range interactions exhibit rich equilibrium and non - equilibrium behavior like the ensemble inequivalence , negative specific heat , and the absence of thermalization .",
    "these properties are atypical for short - range interacting systems .",
    "therefore , studying long - range interacting systems will lead us to deepen our fundamental understanding of statistical mechanics .",
    "those peculiar features of long - range interacting systems have been understood by using mean - field models  @xcite . in mean - field models ,",
    "the interaction between particles or spins is assumed to be independent of distance .",
    "since exact results are available in mean - field models , they are important theoretically although they appear to be too simplified . thus exploring the condition on the realization of predictions by mean - field models should be actively proceeded .",

    "although it is known that the mean - field models reproduce many properties of general long - range interacting systems even quantitatively , the infinite - range ( or curie - weiss type ) interaction does not become an adequate idealization of actual long - range interactions in such a situation .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in this section , we introduce a kind of coarse graining and show that the equilibrium free energy is exactly given by the free energy of the coarse - grained model .",
