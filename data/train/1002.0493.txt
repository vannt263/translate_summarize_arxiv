    "be / x@xmath0ray systems consist of a neutron star in an eccentric orbit with a massive be star , that is a spectral b type star that displays strong balmer emission lines in its optical spectrum ( coe 2000 ) .",
    "be stars are also observed to emit strong infrared radiation .",
    "the balmer emission lines and the infrared radiation are usually attributed to the emission from a circumstellar disk of material around the be star .",
    "the rotation rates of be stars are generally high , sometimes reaching up to @xmath170% of the break - up speed . the high rotation rates of be star are thought to take part in forming a circumstellar disk ( porter & rivinius 2003 ) . in be / x@xmath0ray binaries",
    ", there is a positive correlation between the pulse period of the accreting neutron star and the orbital period of the binary system ( corbet 1986 , waters & van kerkwijk 1989 ) .",
    "be / x@xmath0ray binaries often exhibit x@xmath0ray outburst episodes .",
    "these outbursts are broadly classified as : _ normal outbursts _ with luminosities around 10@xmath2@xmath010@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , lasting for a few days to weeks and _ giant outbursts _ with luminosities @xmath5 10@xmath6 erg s@xmath4 and lasting for weeks to months ( stella 1986 , negueruela 1998 ) .",
    "normal outbursts are generally coincident with the time of the periastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  was first detected on 2005 december 18 with the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) and identified as a transient pulsar with @xmath115 s pulsations ( palmer et al 2005 ) .",
    "the spin period of the neutron star was refined with the subsequent rossi x@xmath0ray timing explorer ( rxte ) / proportional counter array ( pca ) observations as 15.37682(5 ) ( markwardt et al . 2005 ) . at the early phases of the activation , reig et al .",
    "( 2008 ) observed x@xmath0ray flare , lasting about 450 s during which the pulsed fraction was seen to increase up to about 70% .",
    "following the flare , the average count rate and the pulsed fraction went below their pre - flare values for a few hundreds of seconds and indicated a recovery within a few thousands seconds ( belloni et al .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of the proposed companion ( 2mass16263652 - 5156305 , usno - b1.0 0380 - 0649488 ) revealed that the star exhibits strong h@xmath7 emission , indicating that it is a be star ( negueruela & marco , 2006 ) .",
    "as the infrared magnitudes of the companion is rather large for a be star ( j=13.5 , h=13 , k=12.6 ; rea et al .",
    "2006 ) , i.e. the star is unusually faint in infrared band , the system is referred to as an unusual be / x@xmath0ray binary system .",
    "long term monitoring of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  showed strong light curve modulations at timescales of about 45 days ( reig et al .",
    "this modulation was attributed to variations due to the orbital period of the binary or to a harmonic ( reig et al .",
    "recently however , decesar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported two periodicities in this system : 47 days and 72.5 days , on approximate 2:3 ratio .",
    "based upon their findings , they suggested an orbital period of 23 days .",
    "the issue of the orbital period of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  was not resolved .    in this article , we report the discovery of the orbital period of the be / x@xmath0ray binary system containing swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the observations . in  3 , we present our timing analyses and results , and finally in  4 , we discuss the implications of our findings .",
    "we analyzed data from proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard rxte ( jahoda et al 1996 ) of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  between mjd 53724 and mjd 54410 with a total exposure of @xmath8 ksec , divided into 289 observations with exposures between @xmath9 ksec and @xmath10 ksec .",
    "the rxte - pca is an array of 5 proportional counter units ( pcu ) operating in the 2 - 60 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000 @xmath11 and a field of view of @xmath11@xmath12 fwhm . during the observations of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  investigated here , the number of active pcus varied between 1 and 4 .    between mjd 53724 and mjd 53964 ,",
    "1 - 2 ksec long observations were performed every 2 - 3 days .",
    "after mjd 53964 , observations were sampled in close pairs , each of which consists of two consecutive 1 - 2 ksec long observations separated by @xmath13 days .",
    "each of these observation pairs were apart from each other by @xmath14 days .",
    "we generated lightcurves in the 3 - 20 kev band with a time resolution of 0.375s using pca goodxenon data .",
    "each lightcurve was background subtracted using the background lightcurve generated with the background estimator models based upon the rate of very large events , spacecraft activation and cosmic x@xmath0ray emission by mean of the standard pca analysis tools ( pcabackest in headas ) .",
    "times of each lightcurve were converted to the barycenter of the solar system . in figure 3 ( top panel )",
    ", we show the pointing averaged net count rate as detected with pcu2 .    in the pulse timing analysis",
    ", we have used the harmonic representation of pulse profiles ( deeter @xmath15 boynton 1985 ) . in this method ,",
    "the pulse profiles were expressed in terms of harmonic series and cross - correlated with the template pulse profile .",
    "after the 240 days after the main outburst , observations were sampled 0.3 - 0.6 days apart from each other .",
    "these pair of observations were sampled 9 - 10 days apart from each other . in order to avoid cycle count ambiguity due to large gaps in the observation sample , we did not attempt to connect cycle counts in phase . for these observations , we estimated pulse frequencies using the data taken within one day .    in the upper panel of figure 1 ,",
    "we present the long term pulse frequency evolution of the source .",
    "in addition to a spin - up trend , a periodic modulation due to orbital doppler effects can be seen .",
    "the doppler shifted pulse frequency variations , spin up rate and its change can be expressed as the first time derivative of orbital phase model ,    @xmath16    given by deeter , boynton , @xmath15 pravdo ( 1981 ) .",
    "here t@xmath17 is the mid - time of the observation ; @xmath18 is the pulse frequency at t@xmath17 ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the first and second time derivative of the pulse frequency ; @xmath21 is the light traveltime for the projected semimajor axis ( where i is the inclination angle between the line of sight and the orbital angular momentum vector ) ; @xmath22 is the mean orbital longitude at t ; @xmath23 is the epoch when the mean orbital longitude is equal to 90 @xmath12 ; @xmath24 is the orbital period ; e is the eccentricity ; and w is the longitude of periastron .",
    "the above expression is fitted to the pulse pulse frequency time series between mjd 53943.74 and mjd 54410.49 . in table 1",
    ", we list the parameters of the orbital motion , and in figure 1 ( lower panel ) , we present the frequency evolution after removal of the orbital effects .",
    "figure 2 shows the pulse frequency evolution ( after removal of the quadratic trend in pulse frequency ) together with the orbit model and their residuals , respectively .",
    "we find that the source was spinning up during the observation with a rate of @xmath25 hz s@xmath4 .",
    "the periodic trend of the pulse frequencies yields an eccentric orbit ( e=@xmath26 ) with an orbital period of @xmath27 days .",
    ".timing solution of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  ( valid for mjd 53943.74 - 54410.49 ) [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1  parameters ]    we also investigated any connection between source intensity and timing properties of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  . as an intensity indicator , we used count rates in the 3@xmath020 kev range using only pcu2 which had been operating in all observations used here . figure 3 shows the count rate history of the source as well as pulse period evolution after removal of the effects of the orbital motion .",
    "we find that the source exhibits the largest spin - up trend over the interval of the fastest flux decline in the first @xmath190 days from mjd 53724 to 83812 .",
    "when the source starts to show small scale x@xmath0ray flaring at around mjd 53814 ( the vertical dashed lines in figure 3 ) , the spin - up trend slows down while the underlying x@xmath0ray intensity continues to decline .",
    "the source exhibits the largest x@xmath0ray flare starting at @xmath1 mjd 54912 ( indicated by the dotted lines in figure 3 ) .",
    "the onset of this flare is concident with a major spin - up trend change from very slow to rather fast .",
    "the rapid spin up trend continues throughout this major x@xmath0ray flare .",
    "after mjd 53965 ( marked with the dot - dot - dot - dashed lines in figure 3 ) , the spin - up trend remains constant while the source is ongoing subsequent x@xmath0ray flares .        in order to estimate the timescales of the x@xmath0ray modulations",
    ", we applied a lomb - scargle algorithm ( lomb 1975 , scargle 1982 ) for the analysis of unevenly - spaced sample to our data .",
    "we used a 200-day long window sliding along the light curve with a time step of 7 days . for each stretch",
    ", we extracted the period with the highest power .",
    "the analysis was restricted to the oscillating part of the light curve ( see bottom panel in figure 4 ) .",
    "the resulting periods , limited to detections with a chance probability smaller than 0.1 , are plotted in the top panel of figure 4 .",
    "the size of the points is proportional to minus the logarithm of the chance probability , ranging from around @xmath28 around t=400 days ( large points ) to @xmath29 ( small points , t=600 days ) .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to half ( dashed ) and a third ( dotted ) of the orbital period of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  .",
    "we find that the timescale of x@xmath0ray modulations significantly varies between @xmath145 days and 95 days .",
    "the timescale is found to remain nearly constant in the interval of 400@xmath0600 days ( see fugure 4 , bottom panel ) as it was at about 1/3 of the orbital period , and in the interval of 800@xmath0900 at about half the period .",
    "there is an abrupt change in timescales of modulations around t=610 days as it increased from 45 days ( @xmath30/3 ) to 95 days ( @xmath1@xmath30/3 ) in about 40 days .",
    "the rapid evolution of the timescale of modulations can also be seen in the bottom panel of figure 4 ( notice the separation of the two peaks around t=600 and 650 days vs. the separation of the two around 650 and 750 days ) .",
    "we report the discovery of the orbital period of the binary system harbouring swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  as 132.9 days .",
    "we find that the binary system has an orbital eccentricity of 0.08 .",
    "high mass x@xmath0ray binaries fall into three separate groups when the pulse periods are compared with the orbital periods ( corbet 1986 ) . the systems with be companions show correlations between orbital period and spin period ( corbet 1986 , waters & van kerkwijk 1989 ) , while systems with giant and supergiant companions fall into two separate regions .",
    "based on the pulse period and orbital period we discovered , swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  falls into the region of be transients in the corbet diagram .",
    "the derived orbital parameters yield a mass function for the companion , @xmath31 for a @xmath11.4m@xmath32 neutron star mass and orbital inclination angles of 45@xmath12 and 60@xmath12 , the mass of the companion star is found to be @xmath113.5@xmath33 and @xmath18.3@xmath33 , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the companion star is consistent with being a high mass system .",
    "the optical counterpart of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  shows strong h@xmath7 emission with an equivalent width of @xmath34 @xmath35 ( negueruela @xmath15 marco 2006 ) .",
    "this equivalent width implies an orbital period of the be / x@xmath0ray system of the order of @xmath36 days which is consistent with the orbital period reported in our work .",
    "`` a be star '' is an early type non - supergiant star which has a circumstellar disk around its equator , possibly formed by fast spin rotation , non - radial pulsation or magnetic loops ( slettebak 1988 ) .",
    "be / x@xmath0ray binary pulsars often show recurrent x@xmath0ray outbursts .",
    "these x@xmath0ray outbursts are thought to be mainly due to the accretion of this circumstellar disk material onto a neutron star ( negueruela 1998 , inam et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the mass accretion increases at the periastron passages since the density of plasma is greater when the pulsar is close to the companion star .",
    "therefore it is plausible to observe an increase in x@xmath0ray flux during the periastron passage .",
    "this behaviour has been observed in the be / x@xmath0ray binaries 4u 0115 + 63 ( negueruela et al . , 1998 ) ,",
    "ks 1947 + 300 ( galloway et al . , 2004 ) ,",
    "2s 1417 - 624 ( inam et al . 2004 ) and exo 2030 + 375 ( reig 2008 , baykal et al 2008 ) . in case of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  ,",
    "however , we do not find x - ray outbursts coincident with the periastron passages .",
    "this is likely because of the fact that the orbit is nearly circular ( as indicated by very small orbital eccentricity ) , therefore , periastron passages do not provide any extra interaction between the neutron star and circumstellar disk .",
    "although orbital period of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  can also be considered to be typical among be / x@xmath0ray pulsar binaries , eccentricity of the system is one of the smallest among these binaries ( raguzova & popov , 2005 ) . the small eccentricity of the system can be as a result of a weak supernova kick during formation of the system or a post - supernova circularisation by the interaction of the neutron star with the decretion disk of the be star ( martin et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "our timing analysis of the long - term variability ( figure 4 ) has shown that the situation is more complex than what was reported by decesar et al .",
    "we find that modulations at timescales of about a half and a third of the orbital period are indeed more prominent .",
    "for the be / x - ray pulsar systems with high eccentricity , it is quite natural to observe periodic outbursts near the periastron passages ( okazaki & negueruela , 2001 ) .",
    "for instance , modulating twice during an orbital revolution has been seen before in 4u  1907 + 09 ( see e.g. , in t zand , baykal & strohmayer 1998 ) . it could be explained with the be star being tilted with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "this would cause the neutron star to cross its equatorial disk twice during one orbit , leading to periodic increase in accretion rate . for low eccentric systems such as gs 0834 - 430 and xte j1543 - 568 ,",
    "outbursts are seldom and occur due to mass accumulation until a large perturbation develops ( okazaki & negueruela , 2001 ) .",
    "the nature of swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  is completely different compared to the outbursts of these low eccentric systems .",
    "it is more likely that the perturbations in the outer edge of the disk due to the non uniform accretion from the be companion , propagate to the inner edge of the disk as density waves as suggested in exo 2030 + 575 ( wilson et al .",
    "2002 , baykal et al .",
    "these waves lead to small outbursts at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the period of these waves is expected to be related to the resonance size of the accretion disk ( okazaki & negueruela , 2001 ) . in eccentric systems ,",
    "the trigger mechanism of these perturbations is related to the periastron passages , but for swift  j1626.6@xmath05156  it should be an intrinsic property of the be / x - ray pulsar system .",
    "there is no definite theory for the trigger mechanism in low eccentric be / x - ray pulsar systems .",
