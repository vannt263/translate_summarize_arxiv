    "during the last twenty years wilson approach@xcite to the renormalization group ( rg ) has been the subject of a revival in both statistical and quantum field theory and also , quite independently , in the more restricted domain of the equilibrium statistical physics of classical liquids .    in field",
    "theory two main formulations of the non perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) have been developed in parallel . in the first one , a continuous realization of the rg transformation of the action @xmath0 $ ]",
    "is made and no expansion is involved with respect to some small parameter of this action . at scale-@xmath1 ( in momentum space ) the high energy modes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , have been integrated out in the `` wilsonian '' action @xmath4 which is a functional of the slow modes @xmath2 , @xmath5 .",
    "this operation requires the implementation of some cut - off of the propagator aiming at separating slow ( @xmath5 ) and fast ( @xmath3 ) modes .",
    "the flow of the action is governed either by the wilson - polchinski equation@xcite in case of a smooth cut - off or the wegner - houghton@xcite equation in case of a sharp cut - off .",
    "these equations , due to their complexity , call for the use of approximation and/or truncation methods which have been extensively studied these last past years ; we refer to the review of bagnuls and bervillier@xcite for a detailed discussion of this first version of the nprg .",
    "the second , more recent formulation , called the `` effective average action '' approach , was developed after the seminal works of nicoll , chang and stanley for the sharp cut - off version@xcite and wetterich , ellwanger and morris ( wem ) for the smooth cut - off version@xcite .",
    "this method implements on the effective average action @xmath6 $ ] - roughly speaking the gibbs free energy of the fast modes @xmath7 , @xmath3 of the classical field- rather than on the wilsonian action @xmath4 , the ideas of integration of high - energy modes that underlies any rg approach .",
    "the flow of @xmath8 results in equations which can be solved under the same kind of non perturbative approximations than those used for the wilson - polchinski or wegner - houghton equations .",
    "the main advantage of this more recent formulation is that it gives access to the rg flow of physical quantities , i.e. the gibbs free energy @xmath6 $ ] and the correlation functions as well , rather than such a highly abstract object as the wilsonian action .",
    "recent reviews and lectures devoted to this second approach are available@xcite and should be consulted for a thorough discussion .",
    "these two versions of the rg are in fact equivalent ; this not so obvious equivalence is discussed in details by morris in a beautiful paper@xcite .    as can be tracked back in the literature ,",
    "the `` effective average action '' approach of the rg was in fact discovered independently by parola and reatto in the framework of the theory of liquids nearly 25 years ago ; they considered both the sharp and the soft cut - off formulation of the so - called hierarchical reference theory ( hrt)@xcite ; a review article resumes their early achievements@xcite and several papers describing new developments of the soft cut - off version of hrt appeared recently@xcite .",
    "some years ago it was realized that a statistical field description of liquids was possible and the so - called ksshe theory of liquids ( after the names of kac , siegert , stratonovich , hubbard and edwards@xcite ) was introduced and developed in references@xcite . in reference@xcite",
    "it was shown that the wem equations for ksshe field theory are identical to hrt equations in the sharp cut - off limit .",
    "there are however differences for the soft formulations and a picture of the rg of liquids in terms of a wilsonian action does not emerge obviously from these early attempts .",
    "a close inspection of ksshe theory reveals that it is not an `` ordinary '' or `` canonical '' field theory in the sense that the coupling between the scalar `` internal '' field and the `` external '' source , in this very case the chemical potential , is non - linear .",
    "so it is slightly at variance with the usual formulations of field theory where a linear coupling is adopted in general .",
    "it turns out that the full rg construction is much more easy for a ksshe - like theory than for a canonical one .",
    "therefore ideas pertaining to the theory of liquids can be exported to statistical field theory , yielding important simplifications for the latter .",
    "indeed the subtle reasonings of morris@xcite can then be reproduced with a disarming simplicity by the introduction of a `` reference '' , non - gaussian system ; by this way we find that the wilsonian action @xmath4 and the wem action @xmath8 are related by a simple legendre transformation ( up to a trivial quadratic form ) .",
    "this is the main result of article .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ non - cano ]",
    "we show how to build a non - canonical , ksshe - like field theory from a canonical one .",
    "we then follow morris s construction of the rg in section  [ rg ] , obtain the rg flows and discuss the interplay between the wilson - polchinsy and wem formulations of the renormalization group .",
    "the exact mapping onto a related canonical theory is discussed in section  [ map ] .",
    "the full set of flow equations for the effective vertices is then discussed in section  [ hrt ] for the soft and sharp cut - off versions . finally , in section",
    "[ conclusion ] we give an illustration for the theory of liquids and we conclude .    in order to simplify our discussions",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the case of bosonic scalar field theories ; extensions to more complicated cases is certainly possible .",
    "moreover we discuss here only but the `` first step '' of the rg program of wilson , i.e. the blocking of the action and we make no comments or disgressions on the scaling properties of the solutions of nprg equations near a fixed point ; specialists are still at variance on this point , see e.g. reference  @xcite .",
    "to simplify the discussion let us consider a `` reference '' ( r ) system described by a standard scalar field theory .",
    "other representations or generalizations are easy to deal with , as illustrated in section  [ conclusion ] where the case of the theory of liquids is briefly evoked .",
    "the physics of the r - system , i.e. its thermodynamics and correlation functions , is supposed to be known exactly ; it is encoded in the functional @xcite @xmath9 = \\int \\mathcal{d}\\chi \\exp\\left ( -s_{r}\\left [ \\chi \\right ]                                  + j \\cdot \\chi \\right )   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an external source and the action @xmath11 $ ] is an arbitrary functional of the real scalar field @xmath12 ; notably @xmath11 $ ] might comprise terms linear or quadratic in @xmath13 .",

    "as well known @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the generators of ordinary and connected correlation functions which will be written as    @xmath20    where we used the uncluttered notations @xmath21 .    from first principles",
    "@xmath22 $ ] is a convex functional of the source @xmath10 .",
    "its legendre - fenchel transform @xmath23 $ ] , the reference gibbs free energy , is therefore also a convex functional of the classical field @xmath24 .",
    "we thus have    [ legendre ] @xmath25 & = \\sup_{j}\\left ( j \\cdot\\phi - w_{r}\\left [ j \\right ]   \\right )     \\\\ w_{r}\\left [ j \\right ]                 & = \\sup_{\\phi}\\left ( j \\cdot\\phi - \\gamma_{r}\\left [ \\phi \\right ]   \\right )   \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from which we deduce young inequalities @xmath26 +   w_{r}\\left [ j \\right ] \\geq j \\cdot\\phi \\qquad ( \\forall \\phi , \\forall j ) \\ , , \\ ] ] which may be used to obtain rigorous bounds ( see e.g. appendix   b ) .",

    "@xmath29 $ ] is of course not known exactly and will in general result from some approximation , a high - temperature expansion for instance .",
    "the choice of a gaussian model for the r - system would obviously be either of little interest or a lack of ambition . at this point",
