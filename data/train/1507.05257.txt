    "black hole candidates are astrophysical compact objects that can be naturally interpreted as the kerr black holes of general relativity and they could be something else only in the presence of new physics . however , there is not yet direct evidence that the spacetime geometry around these objects is described by the kerr solution and , at the same time , the predictions of general relativity have been tested only in weak gravitational fields .",
    "deviations from standard predictions may be expected for a number of reasons , ranging from classical extensions of general relativity to macroscopic quantum gravity effects at the black hole horizon .",
    "the radiation emitted in the vicinity of black hole candidates is affected by the strong gravitational field around these objects and the study of specific features can potentially test the kerr black hole paradigm@xcite .",
    "this is not an easy job , because there is typically a degeneracy among the parameters of the system . in particular",
    ", there is usually a strong correlation between the estimate of the spin of the compact object and possible deviations from the kerr metric , namely it is difficult ( or even impossible ) to distinguish a kerr black hole from a non - kerr object with a different spin parameter@xcite .",
    "this problem can be solved if it is possible to combine several measurements of the same object and break the parameter degeneracy .",
    "sgra@xmath0 , the supermassive black hole candidate at the center of our galaxy , is a special source and potentially a unique laboratory to test the kerr nature of black hole candidates . while there are currently no good observational data to measure the metric around sgra@xmath0 , the situation may change soon , as sgra@xmath0 could be explored with a number of unprecedented data that , when combined together , may represent the ideal case to test the kerr black hole paradigm@xcite .",
    "promising observations are :    1 .   the observation of radio pulsars@xcite ( or even normal stars@xcite ) with orbital period of a few months",
    "the direct observation of blobs of plasma orbiting at a few gravitational radii from sgra@xmath0@xcite 3 .   the measurement of the spectrum of the accretion structure of sgra@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the detection of the shadow of sgra@xmath0@xcite .    in",
    "what follows , i will briefly discuss the detection of the shadow .",
    "the direct image of a black hole surrounded by an optically thin emitting medium is characterized by a dark area , called `` shadow '' in the literature@xcite . while the intensity map of the image depends on the properties of the accretion flow and on the emission mechanisms , the exact shape of the shadow corresponds to the apparent photon capture sphere , which is only determined by the metric of the spacetime .",
    "an accurate measurement of the boundary of the shadow can constrain possible deviations from the kerr solution .",

    ".     is the distance between the center of the shadow , c , and the point on the boundary of the shadow at the angle @xmath9 .",
    "the function @xmath10 is used to describe the shape of the shadow . from ref .",
    "[ fig1],width=188 ]    the shape of the shadow can be described following the approach of ref .  .",
    "first , we define the center c of the shadow as x_c = , y_c = , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the cartesian coordinates on the image plane of the observer , while @xmath13 inside the shadow and @xmath14 outside .",
    "we can then define the function @xmath15 as the distance between c and the point on the boundary of the shadow at the angle @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "since we do not have accurate measurements of the mass and of the distance of sgra@xmath0 , we can only use the shape of the shadow to test the kerr metric , not its size . in this case",
    ", we can use the function @xmath10 , which completely describes the shape of the shadow .",
    "the shadows and the functions @xmath10 of some cpr black holes are shown in fig .",

    ", we have the opposite case : @xmath19 and @xmath20 can vary . from fig .  [ fig2 ]",

    "@xmath20 alters the shape of the shadow on the side of corotating orbits , while there are no appreciable effects in the other parts of the boundary of the shadow .",
    "the peculiar boundary appearing for @xmath21 and 5 in the bottom right panel is due to be non - trivial horizons of these black holes@xcite    to be more quantitative and figure out if and how different shadows can be distinguished , we can proceed in the following way@xcite .",
    "we consider a `` reference model '' , namely a black hole with a specific set of spin , deformation parameters , and viewing angle .",
    "for any black hole with parameters @xmath22 , we can compute s(a _ * , ^t_3 , ^r_3 , i ) = _ k ( - ) ^2 .",
    "where @xmath23 is the function @xmath24 at @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a set of angles @xmath9 for which we consider a measurement , and @xmath27 is the function @xmath24 of the reference model .",

    "it is related by the usual @xmath29 function by the approximate relation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the square of the error . if we can measure the boundary of the shadow with an uncertainty of 3% , then @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . in this case , the contour levels @xmath34 , 8.03 , and 14.16 corresponding , respectively , to the 1- , 2- , and 3-standard deviations for three degrees of freedom , become @xmath35 , 0.008 , 0.014 .    fig .",
