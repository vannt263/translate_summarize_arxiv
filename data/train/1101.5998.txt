    "superfluid dynamics of interfaces between bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of dilute atomic gases has gained active interest , both in experimental @xcite , and theoretical works @xcite .",
    "these studies started with the experimental realization of a multicomponent bec @xcite and the theoretical investigation of the planar interface structure @xcite . at present , a good deal of the research focuses on the hydrodynamic instabilities at the interfaces in becs , such as the kelvin - helmholtz instability , the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability , the ferrofluid normal - field instability , and the richtmeyer - meshkov ( rm ) instability @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these fundamental instabilities in the classical gas dynamics is the production of vortices at the unstable interface . in that sense ,",
    "dynamics of an interface between two quantum fluids has some unique features with quantized vorticity being , probably , the most specific and the most interesting among them . at the same time",
    ", there is also much similarity between the classical and quantum gas dynamics , which allows `` borrowing '' some classical results and applying them directly or with modifications to the quantum case , see refs . @xcite .",
    "such `` borrowing '' is especially typical in studies of the linear instability stages , for which the difference between the classical and quantum cases is expected to be minimal .",
    "still , the problem of rigorous derivation of such effects in bec systems from the basic principles of quantum theory remains open for most cases .",
    "the derivation is needed not only to justify the extrapolations from the classical to quantum gas dynamics , but also to find limits of such extrapolation as well as to indicate intrinsic quantum effects involved into the problem . as an example , we point out the study of the interface waves in a system of two becs undertaken in ref . @xcite . apart from common capillary waves anticipated from the classical gas - dynamics and related to in - phase perturbations of two becs , ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated also the possibility of quantum counter - phase perturbations , for which the local interpenetration depth of two wave functions for different becs oscillates in time .",
    "thus , one purpose of the present paper is to provide rigorous derivation of the dispersion relations for some fundamental quasi - hydrodynamic instabilities in a two - component bec driven by a time - dependent force .    as a particular experimental realization of such a force , sasaki et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a system of two phase - segregated , interacting becs with different spins placed in an external magnetic field gradient .",
    "this is possible , for example , for two magnetic sublevels of the @xmath0 hyperfine state of @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "starting from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) action for the two component bec system , we derive the equations of motion of small perturbations of the interface .",
    "the other purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the diversity of hydrodynamic effects in a system of two separated becs under the action of a time - dependent force .",
    "recently , within classical gas dynamics , there has been increased interest in the problems of the modified rt and rm instabilities subject to time - dependent gravity , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "the configuration of time - dependent gravity was discussed in the context of specially designed laboratory experiments @xcite , in the scope of the problem of inertial confined fusion @xcite and in relation to flame dynamics @xcite . in particular , stabilization of the rt instability by an oscillating high - frequency addition to the gravity acceleration",
    "has been proposed both in the traditional rt configuration @xcite and for the inertial confined fusion @xcite .",
    "development of the parametric instability at a flame front under the action of acoustic waves and possible stabilization of the hydrodynamic flame instability has been investigated experimentally and theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we show that similar effects take place in becs . apart from the rt and",
    "rm instabilities considered before in @xcite , we demonstrate also the possibility of dynamical stabilization of the rt instability by high - frequency oscillations , as well as triggering of the parametric instability",
    ". another interesting option , which has not been considered yet even in the classical gas - dynamics corresponds to a gaussian stochastic force , which may be markovian or non - markovian with zero or non - zero time correlations , respectively . in the present paper",
    "we show that the markovian stochastic force does not produce any average effect on dynamics of the interface , while the non - markovian force leads to exponential growth of perturbations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate the model . in section iii",
    "we consider a planar ( one - dimensional ) quantum system with a magnetic gradient pushing the becs towards each other , for the case of both constant and time - dependent external forces . in section",
    "iv we derive the equation , which describes the dynamics of small interface perturbations . in section",
    "v we consider interface dynamics under the action of different forces , including a constant force , a harmonic force , a pulse force , and a noisy gaussian force .",
    "the results of the paper are summarized in section vi .",
    "the system of two becs at zero temperature is described by two macroscopic wave functions @xmath4 , and the mean - field gp lagrangian @xcite : @xmath5 , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 are external potential energies of the bec components .",

    "we use the condition of weak separation @xmath18 .",
    "modification of all results of the present paper to the case of different becs is straightforward .",
    "the unperturbed flat interface between two components of bec is located in the @xmath19 plane with @xmath20 indicating the plane of symmetry , fig .",
    "the components @xmath21 and @xmath22 are characterized by their projection of the atom magnetic moment on the @xmath23-axis @xmath24 , respectively .    using the states",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 of the atoms makes it possible to apply the stern - gerlach force , pushing the components in the opposite directions perpendicularly to the magnetic moment quantization axis .",
    "we use a magnetic field whose magnitude has the gradient @xmath27 , which is uniform in space but may be time - dependent . for the case of @xmath28 atoms the stern - gerlach potential energy in eq.([eq1 ] ) reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath31 is the land@xmath32 factor .        the chemical potentials @xmath33 in eq.([eq1 ] ) define normalization of stationary wave functions @xmath34 , and are equal to energy per particle of @xmath35-th condensate , which is made up of the interaction energy due to s - wave scattering and of energy of the particle in the external potential . in order to study low - energetic hydrodynamic processes in becs",
    "we assume that energy per particle is changed negligible due to the external potential , and for normalization one can use value of the chemical potential for @xmath36 in an infinite system .",

    "the present work is devoted to multidimensional instabilities bending an interface between two bec components in an external magnetic field gradient . as the first step in the study",
    ", we have to specify the planar ( one - dimensional , 1d ) quasistationary state , which is influenced by a spatially uniform external field . in the subsections",
    "a and b we consider the cases of constant and time - dependent external fields , respectively .      here",
    "we study the 1d hydrostatic state of becs , when the constant external force @xmath52 is balanced by internal forces of the condensates .",
    "let us assume that such a state was created by adiabatic switching on of the external field , and no perturbations bend the interface .",
    "the steady state is described by two real - valued functions @xmath53 , and the system of dimensionless gp equations reads @xmath54 the time - independent force pushes the bec components towards each other when @xmath55 . with our choice of equal masses and scattering lengths for both components ,",

    "however , the magnitude of the spatial oscillations depends on the value @xmath65 : it decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the spatial oscillations become significant when @xmath66 becomes comparable with @xmath67 , or when @xmath68 ; in this case the tfa becomes invalid , and eqs.([eqarray7]),([eqarray8 ] ) must be solved exactly .",
    "the spatial oscillations may be interpreted as quantum interference of matter waves , caused by interplay between the non - linearity and the dispersion ( the kinetic term ) .",
    "this phenomenon is beyond the scope of the present work , and it will be studied in detail elsewhere .",
    "thus , here we use parameters satisfying the condition @xmath69 or the magnetic gradient @xmath70 satisfying @xmath71 which means that the spatial oscillations of the hydrostatic profiles may be neglected .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) that the critical magnetic gradient @xmath72 depends on the difference between inter- and intra - species interaction parameters as @xmath73 , and on density via the chemical potential since @xmath74 in the tfa for an infinite system in a sufficiently weak external field .",
    "therefore , the effect of quantum interference becomes stronger at lower densities of the becs .",
    "equation ( [ eq10 ] ) yields the dimensionless condition of a well - defined interface between two condensates subject to the particular external force . in the system of two magnetic sublevels of @xmath75",

    "similar to the constant force studied above , for time - dependent forces we also consider rather small magnetic fields , so that the respective 1d bogoliubov excitations may be interpreted as linear acoustic waves .",
    "another type of a time - dependent force studied in this paper is a pulse force corresponding to a weak shock in hydrodynamics .",
    "still , it is known from hydrodynamics that a weak shock may be also described as a linear acoustic wave @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in the present subsection we study modifications of the bec density in the 1d geometry due to the harmonic force .    because of the problem symmetry with respect to @xmath20 , we consider a one - component semi - infinite bec for @xmath82 confined by a wall at @xmath20 .",
    "the magnitude and frequency of the force determines the energy of the generated bogoliubov excitations . in this subsection",
    "we express density and velocity perturbations , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , in terms of magnitude and frequency of the external force , and find the restrictions on the driving force , for which the density perturbations are small @xmath85 .    in the case of a harmonic force ,",
    "the dimensionless external potential is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the force amplitude and @xmath88 is the frequency .",
    "our model system is then described by a time - dependent gp equation @xmath89 where @xmath90 for @xmath82 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 . since the trap potential @xmath93 experiences discontinuity at the `` wall '' , then",
    "the wave function and density are specified only for @xmath92 , no healing of the condensate wave function is required near the wall in tfa , and equilibrium is specified by the uniform density @xmath94 . in that case",

    "in the low energy limit @xmath124 , the boguliubov excitations are sound waves with velocity @xmath125 ( unity in our dimensionless units ) .",

    "we solved the bogoliubov equations for a model infinite system .",
    "the case of a finite system , confined by two walls , is solved analogously , and the boundary condition ( [ eq13 ] ) should be imposed for both walls .",
