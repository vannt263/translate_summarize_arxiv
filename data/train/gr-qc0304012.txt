    "is described by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass - energy density and @xmath5 the pressure as measured in a local rest frame ; compatibility with static symmetry requires the unit vector @xmath6 to be parallel to the static killing vector , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "einstein s field equations can be written so that the `` relativistic potential '' @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 while the remaining equations take the form    [ oppvol ] @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant and where the mass function @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 . to form a determined system ,",
    "these equations must be supplemented by equations characterizing the properties of the perfect fluid matter , e.g. , by a barotropic equation of state @xmath14 .",
    "( [ oppvol ] ) are the equations that govern hydrostatic equilibrium of a self - gravitating spherically symmetric perfect fluid body , eq .",
    "( [ oppvoleq ] ) is the famous tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation @xcite .",
    "the tov equation is fundamental to the study of relativistic stellar models , nonetheless it is associated with certain problems .",
    "one is that the equation is singular at @xmath15 , which leads to mathematical complications .",
    "it was only recently that such central issues as existence and uniqueness of regular static spherically symmetric perfect fluid models could be established @xcite .",
    "a less known but perhaps even more problematic feature is that the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ oppvol ] ) are not differentiable in @xmath5 at @xmath16 for many barotropic equations of state , e.g. , for asymptotically polytropic equations of state , discussed below .",
    "a similar problem occurs when @xmath17 ; even though this limit is unphysical , this is still important .",
    "the relevance of the limit is due to the fact that there are several physical problems that are directly or indirectly governed by the limit @xmath17 .",
    "consider , for example , the buchdahl inequality @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total mass and @xmath20 the surface radius , which implies that no star can have a larger gravitational redshift than @xmath21 at the surface .",
    "all relativistic stellar models satisfy the buchdahl inequality , however , the equality @xmath22 , is associated with a solution of constant mass - energy density and infinite central pressure . among other issues relying on differentiability of @xmath14 in the limit @xmath17",
    "there is , e.g. , the mass - radius relationships for large central pressures which we will discuss in the present paper .",
    "the derivation of the buchdahl inequality exemplifies that sometimes certain rather unphysical solutions , associated with somewhat unphysical equations of state , are important for physical problems .",
    "hence it is useful , indeed essential for certain problems , to understand the entire solution space associated with eqs .",
    "( [ oppvol ] ) , including especially the limiting solutions with infinitely small or infinitely large pressures .",
    "in particular , in order to study generic behavior of solutions , one has to understand the entire solution spaces of large classes of equations of state .",
    "as indicated , the tov equation is rather unsuitable for this task .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a formulation that avoids the above problems and allows us to ( i ) obtain a global picture of the entire solution space of a large set of equations of state and to ( ii ) probe relationships between the equation of state and global features like mass - radius properties . to this end",
    "we will develop a framework based on the theory of dynamical systems ; eqs .",
    "( [ oppvol ] ) will be reformulated as a regular autonomous system of differential equations .",
    "a formulation that allows such a global treatment of solutions can not exist for arbitrary barotropic equations of state .",
    "however , the large classes of equation of state that can be covered are of fundamental importance , as outlined in the following .",
    "let us start by making some dimensional comparisons between general relativity ( gr ) and newtonian gravity .",
    "the dimensions relevant for self - gravitating perfect fluid models are mass , length , and time .",
    "in newtonian theory and in gr these are linked through the gravitational constant @xmath11 .",
    "thus one can choose units so that one unit , e.g. , mass , is expressed in terms of the other two .",
    "in relativity yet another fundamental constant appears ",
    "the speed of light @xmath2 .",
    "this constant reduces the number of independent units to one , e.g. , length .",
    "this restriction on the number of independent scales is of great significance since scaling laws are of great importance in gravitational theory , as in all branches of physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite for references ) .",
    "the newtonian limit of  ( [ potential ] ) and  ( [ oppvol ] ) is obtained by defining the newtonian potential , @xmath23 , there is no need for a distinction between @xmath8 and @xmath24 . ] @xmath25 and letting @xmath26 , thus setting the relativistic `` correction '' terms to zero .",
    "note that @xmath4 stands for the rest - mass density in the newtonian case .",
    "requiring that these equations be invariant under scalings of time and space forces a barotropic equation of state to be a polytrope @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the so - called polytropic index .",
    "the appearance of @xmath2 in relativity reduce the number of scale degrees of freedom from two to one since extra terms arise in the equations as compared to newtonian theory ; these terms originate from spacetime curvature and from pressure , which now also contributes source terms , and are proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "hence polytropes do not leave the relativistic equations invariant under scale transformations . only the linear and homogeneous equation of state @xmath31 does .",
    "invariance implies symmetry , and symmetry implies mathematical simplification .",
    "the existence of scale symmetries allows one to choose all variables except one to be scale - invariant .",
    "doing so leads to that the equation for the single non - scale - invariant variable decouples and thus one obtains a reduced set of equations for the scale - invariant variables .",
    "hence polytropes and linear homogeneous equations of state play a special role in newtonian theory and relativity , respectively  they are the mathematically simplest perfect fluid models these theories admit , and the associated equations can be formulated as symmetry - reduced problems .",
    "the central role these equations of state occupy is not due to gravity alone , but is also based on microscopic considerations of matter models .",
    "again scaling laws can be used to motivate their special status , from a fundamental as well as phenomenological perspective .",
    "consider , e.g. , chandrasekhar s equation of state for white dwarfs , where degenerate electrons contribute the pressure while the baryons supply the mass . in this case",
    "there are two limits  the non - relativistic electron limit , which leads to a polytropic equation of state with index @xmath32 , and the relativistic electron limit , which yields a polytrope with index @xmath33 .",
    "another example is given by an ideal fermi gas .",
    "for extreme relativistic fermions @xmath34 describes the asymptotic behavior of the equation of state , where the fermions supply both the pressure and the mass - energy .",
    "this discussion suggests that it is natural to consider equations of state that are at least asymptotically scale - invariant , i.e. , asymptotically polytropic or linear , and to classify equations of state according to their asymptotic limits ; @xmath35 and @xmath17 .",
    "their special status indicates that asymptotically polytropic / linear equations of state are the mathematically `` simplest '' equations of state  apart from their exact counterparts .    in gr ,",
    "asymptotically linear equations of state possess asymptotic invariance properties , however , surprisingly at first glance , also asymptotic polytropes exhibit similar mathematical simplicity in the low pressure regime .",
    "the reason for this is the following : imposing spherical symmetry and requiring a static perfect fluid equilibrium configuration results in a close connection between newtonian gravity and gr .",
    "the spacetime symmetries prevent the existence of gravitational waves and gravitomagnetic effects , thereby reducing the number of degrees of freedom in gr to the same number as in the newtonian case .",
    "asymptotically , the relativistic equations of hydrostatic equilibrium coincide with their newtonian counterparts provided that @xmath36 when @xmath37 , and hence it follows that variables that are asymptotically scale - invariant in the newtonian case are also asymptotically scale - invariant in gr . accordingly , asymptotically polytropic equations of state can be naturally included in the relativistic formalism .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ dynamicalsystemsformulation ] the dynamical systems approach to relativistic stellar models is presented : by introducing asymptotically scale - invariant variables we reformulate the equations as a dynamical system . in sec .  [ equationsofstate ] we discuss the assumptions on the equations of state that are needed for the dynamical system to become regular . thereby the notion of asymptotically polytropic / linear is made precise .",
