    "the different needs of theorists and experimentalists have traditionally migrated the theorists towards mathematica , while the experimentalists have relied on root as one of the key tools of analysis . with the advent of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the need of collaboration between theorists and experimentalists is as great as ever .    with this in mind , we present _ mathematica _ root importer .",
    "not only have we developed several functions able to import some data contained in root files to _ mathematica _ , we also offer a simple and unified interface to use these functions , taking advantage of the new features of and of _ mathematica _ 8@xcite . while it does not capture all the possible rich data contained in many root files , we present this program in the hope that it may be modified and tweaked to something more useful not only to the hep community , but to the broader _ mathematica _ and root user bases .",
    "it is important at the outset to list what the converter is , and is not , capable of . as provided , it can    * import the list of objects ( and their types ) stored in a root file through iteration of , * import the list of stored in a * import the data of single - leaf of the data type listed in table [ tb : supporteddatatypes ] .",
    "essentially , we support only the basic c - types and some c++ standard template library containers containing these basic types . *",
    "import the bin and error data stored in and objects and create histograms from the bin data .",
    "some of the shortcomings include    * import data from es that contain multiple s , * import data from es whose data type are not listed in table  [ tb : supporteddatatypes ] , * import other types of histogram and objects .",
    "however , it should be noted that in some cases it is relatively straightforward to add additional data and histogram types .",
    "we include a few example data files but this package has also been tested on a large (  5 gbyte ) file structure , d3pd , used by the atlas experiment for offline analysis without problems .    in this initial release we are only distributing source files with executables for the windows platform . for mac and linux machines ,",

    "2 .          knowing the name of a object",
    ", we can proceed to import the data inside the branch .",
    "we may do this via the import element :    _ _ file__,\\{``root'',``ttreedata '' , _ treebranch_.    and _ mathematica _ returns the data stored in the object named _",
    "branch_.    for large data sets , it may be particularly useful to import only parts of a branch .",
    "this may be accomplished with the option with the value in the form of @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 both being positive integers :    _ _ file__,\\{``root'',``ttreedata '' , _ treebranch _ , `` range''@xmath8\\{@xmath6@xmath7 ] .    in this case , _ mathematica _ imports only the @xmath10 through @xmath11 entries , inclusively .",
    "examples of importing data from objects are shown in fig .",
    "this feature , full and partial import of the data in a is arguably the most important feature of the converter .",
    "however , it is limited to s that contain basic types of data , listed in table [ tb : supporteddatatypes ] .",
    "the users may extend the converter to work with additional types of data , as discussed in a later section .",

    "in addition , the _ mathematica _",
    "/framework automatically parses its arguments and we may import several s ( as long as they belong to the same ) in a single call . as with the specific importer , the full importer also takes a option , and imports only specified entries for all the s .",

    "in this section we offer several remarks about the internal workings of the _ mathematica _ root importer that may be of interest to those users interested in extending the converter .",
    "the _ mathematica _ root importer is based on three technologies : cern root to extract the data inside a root file , _ mathlink _ to transmit the extracted data to mathematica , and using _ mathematica _ to post - process the data as necessary .",
    "the root and _ mathlink _ portions of the code are contained in the file , and this _ mathlink _ template file needs to be processed by the utility included in _ mathematica _ before it can be compiled using a c++ compiler .",
    "the _ mathlink _",
    "executable defines several low - level functions defined under the context .",
    "the input signatures of these functions are defined in .",
    "for example ,    returns the same output as because the `` keys '' importer essentially wraps around the low - level function .",
    "there are , however , several importance advantages using the call :    * the framework automatically passes the full path to the converter functions , * among other checks , the framework checks that the file actually exists before calling the low - level functions * the framework provides an easy - to - use interface that may call several low - level functions in one input and allows users to customize the form of the output      our current implementation likely needs to be extended before reaching its full potential as a bridge between mathematica and root .",
    "recognizing this , we have taken the effort to document both the _ mathlink _ and _ mathematica _ portions of the code , and the existing functions may serve as templates for further development .    occasionally , the authors may also provide fixes and new features to the code , in which case the online version of this document will be correspondingly updated .",
    "this paper presents a simple implementation of a _ mathematica _ importer for root that is able to import some data stored in and the histogram objects and . taking advantage of the import / export plug - in mechanism",
    ", the importer offers an easy - to - use interface while the core while it does not capture all the possible rich and flexible data types typically stored in the root files , it is nonetheless an effective and useful first step , as evident in our usage / test in importing a large atlas data set .",
    "the open - source nature of the project opens doors for the importer to be improved and customized , and we hope this tool will be useful to broad communities of _ mathematica _ and root users .",
    "we are grateful to stephen wolfram and peter overmann for dedicating the resources that made this project possible .",
    "we also thank philippe canal , valeri fine , pavel nevski , and fons rademakers for helping us with various aspects of cern root .",
    "kh would also like to thank abdul dakkak and william sehorn for assisting with parts of this project ."
