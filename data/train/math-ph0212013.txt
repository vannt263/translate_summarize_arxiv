    "the term @xmath135 denotes the non - gluonic charge .",
    "eq.([3.24 ] ) implies that all local observables , in the physical space , commute with the color charges , that is , @xmath3 is a non - abelian superselection rule .",
    "in particular it implies that ( local ) color charges can not be observable quantities . therefore the fact that color charges are not observable",
    "is not a dynamical question , in the sense that it does not depend on the detailed dynamics of non - abelian gauge theory but simply on the fact that current conservation occurs in a particular form , namely the current is the divergence of an antisymmetric tensor .",
    "unobservability of color charges is therefore a trivial consequence of non - abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "the deep question is of course why there is an exactly conserved color gauge symmetry .",
    "it is possible that the second of the confinement statements , the existence of just color singlets , may also be a `` kinematical '' consequence of gauge symmetry , although the situation here is not so obvious .",
    "the existence of a non - abelian superselection rule implies that the superselection sectors are labelled by the eigenvalues of the casimir operators",
    ". for all except the singlet sector , there will be more than one vector corresponding to the same physical state .",
    "hence if non - singlet states were to exist , their description would imply a departure from the usual quantum mechanical framework . namely there would not exist a complete commuting set of observables and the description of scattering experiments , for example ,",
    "would require special care because the computed matrix elements would depend on the initial and final vector representatives chosen among the physically equivalent multiplet vectors@xcite .",
    "a description using direct integral spaces@xcite or some other form of averaging over initial and final physically equivalent vectors would be mandatory to obtain unambiguous predictions .",
    "if color is an unbroken symmetry , the question of confinement is not whether any colored states are going to be found , because color charges are unobservable anyway , but whether the colorless objects one sees are real singlets or some sort of balanced admixture of hidden color states .",
    "it is here however that non - generic strata play a role .",
    "the quadratic condition @xmath136 means exactly that the ( gluonic ) charge associated to excitations around a nongeneric background is zero .",
    "therefore if the background belongs to a non - generic stratum , the perturbative vacuum for example , the gluonic low lying excitations around this background must be singlets .",
    "nothing is said , of course , concerning excitations around generic states or non - gluonic states .",
    "for quantized gravitational fluctuations around a symmetric background spacetime , it has been found@xcite that the effect of quadratic constraints is to suppresses transitions to configurations of lower symmetry .",
    "this led some authors@xcite @xcite to conjecture that the amplitude of the schrdinger functional would display particular enhancements ( or suppressions ) near the singularities .",
    "this was illustrated by studying finite - dimensional examples of the schrdinger equation in configuration spaces with conical singularities .",
    "however , for gauge theories , there is not always suppression of fluctuations to configurations of lower symmetry .",
    "the degeneracy space of the quadratic form @xmath137 ( eq.[3.22 ] ) characterizes the fluctuations with the same symmetry as the background @xmath138 .",
    "but , in addition to this manifold with the same symmetry as @xmath80 , there are other solutions , with different symmetry , leading to the conical singularity . for an initial condition in some stratum",
    ", it is known that classical solutions remain in the same stratum@xcite , but quantum fluctuations will in principle explore all the solutions compatible with the linear and quadratic constraints .",
    "therefore , the conjecture of enhancement near conical singularities may indeed be true , but it does not necessarily follows from the theory described above .    in the next section , by studying an approximation to the ground state functional of su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theories , one finds additional circumstantial evidence for enhancements near particular classes of non - generic strata .",
    "using an approximation to the ground state functional , it will be found that some field configurations , corresponding to reducible strata , concentrate the ground state measure .",
    "the approximation to the ground state functional is based on an expansion of the path integral representations@xcite @xmath139 or @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the finite or infinite - dimensional set of configuration space variables , and @xmath142 is the euclidean action . making the change of variables @xmath143 adding a term @xmath144 to the euclidean lagrangian @xmath145 , separating the terms quadratic or less than quadratic in @xmath146 from higher order terms @xmath147 and computing the gaussian integrals for the fluctuations around each configuration @xmath141",
    ", the following representation is obtained for @xmath148@xmath149 where @xmath150 the evaluation of the gaussian integrals requiring @xmath151 . in the @xmath152 limit , @xmath153 reduces to @xmath154    expanding @xmath155 , successive approximations to the ground state are obtained .",
    "of particular interest is the leading term @xmath156 which differs from a perturbative estimate in the fact that , around each point of the wave functional , a different expansion point is chosen , which is @xmath141 itself . in the functional integral representation of the ground state , the wave functional is the integrated effect of paths coming from the infinite past to the point @xmath141 at @xmath157 .",
    "because near @xmath141 the difference @xmath158 is small , the leading term will contain accurate information from all paths in the neighborhood of @xmath141 , and will be inaccurate only regarding non - harmonic contributions to the paths far away from @xmath141 . for many problems ,",
    "like the quartic or exponential oscillators one finds that , up to a shift of parameter values , the leading term is already practically indistinguishable from the exact ground state .    for non - abelian gauge fields one uses the schrdinger formulation for quantum fields@xcite @xcite",
    "@xmath159 is the space - time euclidean vector potential , @xmath160 the time - zero field , @xmath161 the nonabelian curvature field and @xmath162 its time - zero counterpart .",
    "the time - zero fields are the canonical variables and the chromoelectric fields the conjugate momenta .",
    "making the change of variables @xmath163 the euclidean lagrangian is @xmath164    to construct the ground state approximation according to eq.([4.8 ] ) , notice that @xmath165 with @xmath166    using ( [ 4.8 ] ) , the leading term for the ground state functional is @xmath167 where the following operator has been defined @xmath168      if @xmath169 , the isotropy groups and the structure groups of the maximal subbundles are : @xmath170 there are three strata .",
    "stratum 1 is the generic stratum .",
    "the other two are reducible strata .    for particular classes of fields , the leading ground state approximation , described above ,",
    "may be given a simple explicit form , which allows us to test the role of the different strata on the construction of low energy states .",
    "low - energy states are expected to be associated to fields which , at least locally , are slowly varying .",
    "therefore a natural subclass to be studied is the one of constant non - abelian fields @xmath171 restricted to a finite space volume @xmath172 .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath173 being symmetric , this matrix may be diagonalized by a space rotation . as a result , without loss of generality , @xmath174 is a set of orthogonal vectors and the @xmath175 coordinates may be chosen such that @xmath176 then @xmath177 using a standard representation for the fractional powers of positive operators@xcite @xmath178 and computing @xmath179 one obtains @xmath180 \\\\",

    "for example for @xmath182 the exponent @xmath183 in @xmath184 becomes @xmath185    the function depicted in fig.1 . as a consequence , for this class of fields , the ground state functional",
    "is peaked both near strata of type @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "three remarks are in order at this point :    \\(i ) when two of the constants vanish ( for example @xmath188 ) , the chromomagnetic fields in ( [ 4.18 ] ) also vanish .",
    "therefore a point strictly on the plane ( @xmath188 ) might be identified by a gauge transformation to the origin .",
    "however by choosing ( @xmath189 ) one obtains , for small @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "therefore arbitrarily large chromomagnetic fields exist with high probability near the plane ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the holonomy group is generated by @xmath194 with centralizer @xmath195 .",
    "this justifies the statement that there is a @xmath195 stratum acting as a concentrator of the ground state measure .",
    "\\(ii ) the same reasoning implies that large field fluctuations are to be expected in the non - perturbative vacuum and this approximate ground state functional provides a dynamical view of the vacuum condensates .",
    "\\(iii ) on the other hand , one should not expect all fields in the non - generic strata to act as concentrators of the ground state measure .",
    "a counter example would be a @xmath195 field with a fast space variation .",
    "therefore , as stated before , a simple reasoning based on suppression of transitions by the quadratic constraints can not be the whole story .",
    "similar remarks apply to the role played by the nongeneric strata in @xmath1 , to be discussed below .",

    "most gauge theory studies restrict themselves to @xmath201 .",
    "however , we will see in a while that , like in su(2 ) , there are important contributions from the non - generic strata to low - lying states .",
    "in addition and contrary to the su(2 ) case , this structure is not unique , several possible non - equivalent configurations being possible .",

    "the stratification of the octet space by su@xmath204 orbits@xcite , characterizes the independent choices . however , what is important here is not only su(3 ) geometrical independence but to characterize the choices that lead to qualitatively different ground state functionals .",

    "low - lying physical states being represented by quantum fluctuations around the ground state functional one also concludes that , at least in the leading order approximation of the expansion leading to eq.([4.13 ] ) , there may be distinct classes of excitations around each type of non - generic strata .",
    "this is a much richer structure than the one implied by the perturbative vacuum ( stratum 5 ) . on the other hand",
    "the high probability that is assigned to large chromomagnetic fluctuations in the ground state functional is consistent with the phenomenological evidence for the existence of non - trivial vacuum condensates in the qcd vacuum@xcite @xcite .",

    "the possibility of making this reduction depends on the global structure of the base manifold @xmath5 .",
    "this problem is not addressed here , because we have been concerned mostly with a local analysis .",
    "furthermore in our discussion of non - trivial vacuum backgrounds , no symmetry breaking is implied .",
    "all equivalent directions in the functional ( [ 4.13 ] ) are equiprobable and the full gauge symmetry is preserved ."
