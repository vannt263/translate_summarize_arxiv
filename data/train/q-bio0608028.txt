    "the incubation period is generally defined as ` the time duration between the time a virus or bacteria enters the human body and the time at which clinical clinical symptoms occur ' .",
    "this duration can vary from case to case depending upon the route through which the virus or bacteria enters the immune system of an individual and in some cases depends upon the age of the infected individual . for influenza",
    "this duration is 1 - 2 days , for common cold 2 - 5 days , for measles 8 - 12 days , for sars a maximum of up to 10 days , for rubella 14 - 21 days , and for hiv infection to aids 6 months to 10 years or more .",
    "the incubation period can be used as a measure of rapidity of the illness after interaction with the virus or bacteria .",
    "it is not easy to collect information on the incubation period of infected individuals unless they are monitored .",
    "one of the direct ways of estimating the average incubation period of a given virus in the population is by surveillance and followup of the infected individuals until they develop symptoms .",
    "all the infected individuals may not be aware of their infection until symptoms appear and followup is subject to the availability of an individual",
    ". it might not be possible to follow up individuals in a typical situation , where time taken for the onset of symptoms from the infection is longer , especially if infected individuals are lost to followup .",
    "hence , there are limitations on directly estimating the everage incubation period from prospective cohort studies .",
    "nevertheless , the incubation period occupies an important role along with other parameters in modelling the disease spread and understanding the basic reproductive rate . a useful description of various epidemic models , and of estimation of parameters like the incubation period , transmission rates , forces of infections are presented in anderson and may ( 1991 ) .",
    "the degree of importance of obtaining accurate average incubation periods varies with the incubation period of the disease .",
    "this degree of variation causes mathematical models to act sensitively in predicting future burden .",
    "models describing dynamics of disease spread where the incubation period is shorter are less subject for producing misleading results than models for the spread with longer and varying incubation periods . especially for predicting aids",
    ", the epidemic models developed , depend heavily on parameters that determine transmission rates of infection from infected to susceptible and on the parameter which explains the average time to progress to aids .",
    "a review of various modeling approaches and quantitative techniques to estimate the incubation period can be found in castillo - chavez ( 1989 ) and brookmeyer and gail ( 1994 ) .",
    "a set of parametric and non - parametric models are proposed to estimate the incubation period when the data is doubly - censored ( rao et al 2005 ) .",
    "the introduction of anti - retroviral therapies and protease inhibitors during the 1990s in several parts of the world resulted decline in opportunistic infections related to aids ( mouton et al ( 1997 ) et al ( 1999 ) , conti , s et al ( 2000 ) , hung et al ( 2003 ) ) . as a result of such interventions ,",
    "the incubation period was prolonged .",
    "there have been attempts to estimate the incubation period that vary due to drug intervention using statistical density functions ( artzrouni ( 1994 ) )",
    ". the impact of this variation on the hiv dynamics , stability and on basic reproduction number has been investigated ( castillo - chavez et al ( 1989 ) ) . in this section ,",
    "we first consider a simple ode model that explains the dynamics of hiv spread in a population leading to aids .",
    "we then consider a similar model where incubation period is a variable with respect to a given therapy . we address issues of estimating incubation period to be used in such dynamical models and the impact of above mentioned therapies .",
    "various ideas and the outline of this work are given at the end of this section .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental model for the epidemiology of aids is that given by anderson and may ( 1988 , 1991 ) , which takes the form    @xmath1    here the total population ( @xmath2 ) is divided into susceptibles ( @xmath3 ) , infectives ( @xmath4 ) and individuals with the full blown disease ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is the input into the susceptible class , which can be defined as the number of births in the population , @xmath7 is the force of infection , @xmath8 is general ( non - aids related ) mortality , @xmath9 is disease related mortality and @xmath10 is the average incubation period . here",
    "the incubation period is defined as the duration of time between infection and onset of full blown disease .",
    "there has been an observed increase in the mean incubation period since the availability of therapies for aids ( unaids , 2002 ) .",
    "drugs are available which can not eliminate virus from the body , but are helpful in prolonging the life of an individual by slowing the disease progression ( in other words increasing the incubation period ) .",
    "for example , protease inhibitors ( say _ drug 1 ) _ facilitate in producing non - infectious virus ( only infectious virus participates in new virus production ) , hence slowing the disease progression ; anti - retroviral therapy ( _ say drug 2 ) _ blocks virus from interracting with the non - infected cells and hence reduces the infection process within the cell population ( see section 5 , nowak and may ( 2000 ) and perelson and nelson ( 1999 ) for fuller details ) ; and a combination of the above two drugs ( _ say drug 3 _ ) can be more effective by simultaneously combining the function of _ drug 1 _ and _ drug 2 . _",
    "note that , when model ( 1.1 ) was developed , the above described drugs were not available .",
    "we assume that once individuals start taking drugs , their average incubation period is prolonged .",
    "so , instead of assuming a constant @xmath10 , we assume that it varies based on the drug type .",
    "thus we define @xmath11 for @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the without drug scenario , @xmath14 for _ drug 1 , @xmath15 _ for _ drug 2 _ and @xmath16 for _ drug 3_. here @xmath17 is the probability density function with a certain parameter set ( say @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is a continuous random variable representing the incubation period .",
    "here @xmath19 is a real valued function defined on a standard probability space @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the space of elementary events , @xmath22 is called a borel fields , and @xmath23 is probability of the event @xmath24 so , @xmath25 we can also denote this integral as a stieltjes integral @xmath26 , where @xmath27 we further assume without loss of generality that    @xmath28    ( in the next section , we will give a detailed estimation procedure for @xmath29 ) applying these varying incubation periods , model ( [ 1.1 ] ) is modified as follows :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are variables for infectives , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are variables for individuals with the full blown disease , @xmath35 and @xmath36and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are variables for disease related mortality for no - drug , _ drug 1 , drug 2 _ and _ drug 3 _ respectively .",
    "general mortality and disease - related mortality are incorporated in to the model to demonstrate the basic structure of the model , and our aim here is to estimate @xmath18 and thus to estimate @xmath26 for all @xmath39 such that simulations of the model are performed . in model ( [ 1.3 ] ) , the total population @xmath40 satisfies    @xmath41    estimation of parameters for the varying incubation periods is important for understanding the impact of drugs in prolonging the onset of disease and thus to prolong the life .",
    "the set @xmath18 will also be useful in obtaining varying basic reproductive rates , @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "this can be computed as @xmath44 by assuming independence of the impact of various drugs .",
    "so far , there is no evidence that @xmath45 the probability of infecting a susceptible partner , changes with the activation of a drug in the body . if we assume this as a constant , then @xmath46 or @xmath47 @xmath48 because individuals are assumed to have longer incubation period due to the effect of drugs . in the absence of clinical evidence , we assume that the impact of _ drug1 _ and _ drug2 _ follows any one of the following relations : @xmath49 or @xmath50 similarly , another important epidemiological measure , the doubling time , @xmath51 is obtained as @xmath52.$ ]    anti - retroviral therapy helps in blocking the virus from interacting with cells and simultaneously providing protease inhibitors helps in producing non - infectious virus .",
    "so without loss of generality , it is assumed that the impact of double drug therapy is better than a single drug therapy .",
    "if we assume disease related mortality is constant for all @xmath39 then @xmath53 where there are @xmath54 types of drugs available , we write the general form for the above dynamical model as follows :    @xmath55    as a special case we can consider all the parameters in the above model as stieltjes integrals and can estimate them using the rigorous procedure explained in the next section .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we describe in detail the estimation of the set @xmath18 for up to three drugs ; section 3 gives the corresponding expressions for the conditional probabilities of @xmath56drugs .",
    "we construct some theoretical examples in section 4 to demonstrate the method explained in section 2 .",
    "there were several attempts to study , through ode models , the role of anti - retroviral therapy and protease inhibitors in controlling the virus multiplication inside the human body . in section 5",
    "we briefly review these models . in section 6",
    "analysis for age - structured populations is described in detail .",
    "overall conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "appendix i gives equations for conditinal probability when incubation period for various drug types does not have the monotonicity property .",
    "appendix ii gives some more theoretical examples when the incubation period is truncated to the right .",
    "in this section , we will give a detailed procedure to estimate @xmath18 through a deconvolution technique .",
    "let @xmath18 be split into a collection of four parameter sets say , @xmath18=@xmath57 for the four types of scenarios described in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath58 be the time of infection and @xmath59 be the incubation period , then the time of onset of the disease can be represented as @xmath60 there have been studies ( see for list of references brookmeyer and gail ( 1994 ) ) , in which @xmath58 and @xmath59 were assumed independent and @xmath61 was estimated through convolution .",
    "we outline the general idea of convolution and then give the convolution of @xmath58 and @xmath62 suppose @xmath63 and @xmath64 are two sequences of numbers over the time period , then    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the convolution of these sequences with an operator @xmath67 .",
    "suppose @xmath68 and @xmath69 are mutually independent random variables and let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be their laplace transformations , then @xmath72 has the laplace transformation @xmath73 since the multiplication of the laplace transformation is associative and commutative , it follows that @xmath66 is also associative and commutative . instead of discrete notation ,",
    "suppose @xmath68 and @xmath69 are continuous and independent with probability density functions @xmath74 and @xmath17 , then the density of @xmath75 is given by    @xmath76    .",
    "suppose @xmath77 , and @xmath78 then    @xmath79    we call @xmath80 the convolution of @xmath74 and @xmath81 .",
    "suppose the above @xmath74 and @xmath81 represent the infection density and incubation period distribution function ; then the convolution of @xmath74 and @xmath81 represents the cumulative number of disease cases reported ( or observed ) , and is given by    @xmath82    the kind of convolution in ( [ 2.3 ] ) was used to estimate the number of aids cases for the first time by brookmeyer and gail ( 1988 ) .",
    "information on @xmath81 may not be available for some populations .",
    "in such situations , @xmath81 has been estimated through deconvolution from the information available on @xmath83 and @xmath74 ( rao and kakehashi , 2004 , 2005 ) . in this section",
    "we will construct conditional probabilities for each _ drug type _ and express the function that maximizes @xmath18 .",
    "these kind of conditional probabilities derived for the _ drug _ _ type _ were not available earlier for the incubation periods when the total number of reported disease cases were considered .",
    "note that @xmath83 is the cumulative number of disease cases .",
