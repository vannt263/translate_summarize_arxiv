    "there are two extreme limits of a projectile scattering from a nucleus .",
    "when the cross section of the projectile with a nucleon is very small , as is the case for neutrinos , glauber theory says that the cross section with a nuclear target of atomic number @xmath0 grows linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "when the cross section with an individual nucleon is very large , as is the case for pions near the delta resonance peak , the nucleus appears black and the cross section grows like @xmath3 .",
    "a more interesting case is the production of lepton pairs with large invariant mass , often referred to as drell - yan , in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "both the elastic and inelastic cross sections for proton - nucleon scattering are relatively large , but the partial cross section to produce a high mass lepton pair , being electromagnetic in origin , is relatively small .",
    "experiments have shown that the inclusive drell - yan cross section grows with @xmath0 to a power very close to 1 .",
    "the theoretical interpretation is that the hard particles , the high invariant mass lepton pairs , appear first and the soft particles , the typical mesons , appear later due to quantum - mechanical interference , essentially the uncertainty principle .",
    "these quantum coherence requirements also lead to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect @xcite .",
    "deviations from the power 1 by high precision drell - yan experiments @xcite at fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) suggest that it may be possible to infer a finite numerical value for the coherence time .",
    "that is one of our goals .",
    "another of our goals is to take this coherence time effect into account when extracting an absorption cross section for @xmath2 on nucleons for @xmath2 particles produced in high energy proton - nucleus collisions . after extracting this absorption cross section",
    ", we use it to carry out parameter - free calculations of @xmath2 production in s+u and pb+pb collisions to help us ascertain the likelihood that new physics must be invoked , that is , quark - gluon plasma .    before addressing these goals",
    "it is imperative to have a basic description of high energy proton - nucleus collisions which reproduces the essential data on outgoing baryons and mesons .",
    "we will use one particular theoretical approach , referred to as lexus . using input from nucleon - nucleon collisions together with geometry , lexus does describe the data very well . see @xcite .",
    "however , it important to realize that any model or extrapolation which incorporates the same basic features will lead to the same conclusions we find here .",
    "consider a description of the drell - yan process in a proton - nucleus collision .",
    "one limit is full energy degradation of the proton as it traverses the nucleus .",
    "produced hadrons appear immediately with zero coherence time , causing the proton to have less energy available to produce a drell - yan pair at the backside of the nucleus .",
    "the other limit is usually referred to as glauber , although this is a bit of a misnomer .",
    "produced hadrons , being soft on the average , do not appear until after the hardest particles , the drell - yan pair , have already appeared .",
    "this is the limit of a very large coherence time , and it allows the proton to produce the drell - yan pair anywhere along its path with the full incident beam energy .",
    "an intermediate case is one of finite , nonzero coherence time . by the time the proton wants to make a drell - yan pair on the backside of the nucleus",
    ", hadrons have already appeared from the first collision but not from the second .",
    "therefore the proton has more energy available to produce the drell - yan pair than full zero coherence time but less energy than with infinite coherence time .",
    "this ought to result in an @xmath0 dependence less than 1 , with the numerical value determined by the coherence time .",
    "it is instructive to contemplate the relative importance of energy loss and coherence time for an 800 gev proton incident on a _ very _ large nucleus , such as a neutron star : can one imagine the proton reaching the backside of a neutron star and producing a drell - yan pair without having suffered _ any _ energy loss ?",
    "consistent with our philosophy to describe everything in terms of hadronic variables we should use a parametrization of measured drell - yan cross sections in pp and pn collisions .",
    "however , we need these over a very broad energy range because of the decreasing energy of the proton as it cascades through the nucleus , and such broad measurements have not been made .",
    "therefore , we compute the drell - yan yields in individual pp and pn collisions using the parton model with the grv structure functions @xcite to leading order with a k factor .",
    "these structure functions distinguish between pp and pn collisions .",
    "we have compared the results to pp collisions at the same beam energy of 800 gev @xcite and found the agreement to be excellent for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "the experiment e772 @xcite measured the ratio @xmath5 .",
    "were there no energy loss and all nuclei were charge symmetric this ratio would be equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the experiment measured muon pairs with invariant mass @xmath6 between 4 and 9 gev and greater than 11 gev to eliminate the @xmath2 and @xmath7 contributions .",
    "the data has been presented in 7 bins of feynman @xmath4 from 0.05 to 0.65 .",
    "( recall that @xmath4 is the ratio of the muon pair longitudinal momentum to the incident beam momentum in the nucleon - nucleon c.m . frame . )",
    "data for an exemplary value of @xmath4 is shown in figure [ pady1 ] .",
    "of the drell - yan pair is 0.65 .",
    ", width=384 ]    the data should fall on the dashed line if the ratio of cross sections is @xmath0 .",
    "there is a small but noticeable departure for tungsten and at the largest value of @xmath4 .",
    "this is to be expected if energy loss plays a role as it must affect the largest target nucleus and the highest energy muon pairs the most @xcite .",
    "we have computed the individual cross sections @xmath8 with a variable time delay .",
    "the proton cascades through the nucleus as described earlier , but we assume that the energy available to produce a drell - yan pair is that which the proton has after @xmath9 previous collisions . thus @xmath10 is full energy loss and @xmath11 is zero energy loss .",
    "we have taken the resulting proton - nucleus drell - yan cross section , multiplied it by 2 , divided it by the sum of the computed pp and pn cross sections and display the results in figure [ pady1 ] .",
    "( for plots of other values of @xmath4 see @xcite . )",
    "the lower edge of the shaded regions in the figure corresponds to @xmath12 and the upper edge to @xmath13 .",
    "overall the best representation of the data lies in this range .",
    "this collision number shift is easily converted to a coherence time .",
    "let @xmath14 be the coherence time in the c.m .",
    "frame of the colliding nucleons .",
    "this is essentially the same as the formation time of a pion since most pions are produced with rapidities near zero in that frame .",
    "the first proton - nucleon collision is the most important , so boosting this time into the rest frame of the target nucleus and converting it to a path length ( proton moves essentially at the speed of light ) gives @xmath15 .",
    "this path length may then be equated with @xmath9 times the mean free path @xmath16 . using a total cross section of 40 mb and a nuclear matter density of 0.155",
    "nucleons/@xmath17 we obtain a path length of 8@xmath12 fm and a proper coherence time of 0.4@xmath10.1 fm / c corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "this value of the proper coherence time is just about what should have been expected _ a priori_. in the c.m .",
    "frame of the colliding nucleons at the energies of interest a typical pion is produced with an energy of e@xmath19 mev . by the uncertainty principle",
    "this takes a time of order @xmath20 fm / c .",
    "a process related to drell - yan is the production of @xmath2 which we shall address now .",
    "this is also a relatively hard process and so both energy loss of the beam proton and the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect must be taken into account .",
    "however , there is an additional effect which plays a role , and that is the occasional absorption or breakup of the @xmath2 in encounters with target nucleons .",
    "( the inelastic interaction of one of the leptons in drell - yan production with target nucleons is ignorably small . )",
    "the absorption cross section , @xmath21 , has been estimated in a straightforward glauber analysis without energy loss and with an infinite coherence / formation time to be about 6 - 7 mb @xcite .",
    "this has formed the basis for many analyses of @xmath2 suppression in heavy ion collisions .",
    "any anomalous suppression may be an indication of the formation of quark - gluon plasma @xcite , hence the importance of obtaining the most accurate value of @xmath21 possible .",
    "this cross section has also been inferred from photoproduction experiments of @xmath2 on nuclei from which a value much less than that has been obtained @xcite .",
    "this has been a puzzle .",
    "one attempt to resolve this apparent discrepancy consists of modeling the produced @xmath2 state as a pre - resonant color dipole state with two octet charges @xcite ; however , the results are only semi - quantitative .     with @xmath22 in proton - nucleus collisions at 450 gev / c .",
    "the data is from na38 @xcite .",
    "the dashed line is @xmath0 times the nucleon - nucleon production cross section .",
    "the solid curve represents full energy loss with zero coherence / formation time , while the banded region represents partial energy loss with a coherence / formation time within the limits set by drell - yan production .",
    "( computations were done for c , al , cu , w and u and the points connected by straight lines to guide the eye.),width=384 ]    in order to compute the production cross section of @xmath2 in proton - nucleus collisions we need a parametrization of it in the more elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions . for this",
    "we call upon the parametrization of a compilation of data by loureno @xcite . @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the branching ratio into dimuons and @xmath4 is the ratio of the momentum carried by @xmath2 to the beam momentum in the center of mass frame @xmath25 . due to the degradation in momentum of the proton as it traverses the nucleus it is important to know the @xmath4 dependence of the production .",
    "the fermilab experiment e789 has measured this dependence at 800 gev / c @xcite to be proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "assuming that this holds at lower energy too we use the joint @xmath27 and @xmath4 functional dependence and magnitude : @xmath28 the cross section in proton - nucleus collisions can now be computed in lexus with no ambiguity .",
    "figure [ pajpsi1 ] shows the results of our calculation in comparison to data taken by na38 @xcite . the dashed curve is @xmath0 times the nucleon - nucleon production cross section ; it obviously overestimates the data .",
    "the solid curve shows the result of lexus with full energy degradation of the beam proton without account taken of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect ; it obviously underestimates the data .",
    "the hatched region represents the inclusion of the latter effect with a proper formation / coherence time @xmath14 in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 fm / c consistent with drell - yan production .",
    "the time delay is implemented as described previously : the energy available for the production of @xmath2 is that which the proton had @xmath9 collisions prior ; that is , the previous @xmath9 collisions are ignored for the purpose of determining the proton s energy .",
    "this is an approximate treatment of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect .",
    "the @xmath9 is related to the beam energy and to the coherence time @xmath14 in the center of mass frame of the colliding nucleons .",
    "using , as before , a total cross section of 40 mb , a nuclear matter density of 0.155 nucleons/@xmath17 , and @xmath29 fm / c we obtain @xmath30 at 200 gev / c and @xmath31 at 450 gev / c . as may be seen from the figure , the data is overestimated , indicating the necessity for nuclear absorption .",
    "we now introduce a @xmath2 absorption cross section on nucleons and compute its effect within lexus in the canonical way @xcite .",
    "when the @xmath2 is created there will in general be a nonzero number of nucleons blocking its exit from the nucleus .",
    "knowing where the @xmath2 is created allows one to calculate how many nucleons lie in its path , and hence , to compute the probability that it will be dissociated into open charm .",
    "we choose a value of @xmath14 allowed by drell - yan measurements , mentioned above , and then vary @xmath21 , assuming that it is energy independent .",
    "the lowest value of chi - squared for the 200 and 450 gev / c data set taken together is obtained with @xmath32 fm / c and @xmath33 mb .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ bestfit ] .    .",
    "the solid curve is the best fit of the model which includes beam energy loss with a coherence time of 0.5 fm / c ( n=5 at this energy ) and a @xmath2 absorption cross section of 3.6 mb .",
    ", width=384 ]    the fitted values all lie within one standard deviation of the data points .",
    "this is quite a satisfactory representation of the data .",
    "it means that both drell - yan and @xmath2 production in high energy proton - nucleus collisions can be understood in terms of a conventional hadronic analysis when account is taken of the energy loss of the beam proton , the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect , and nuclear absorption of the @xmath2 in the final state .",
    "it also means that the absorption cross section for @xmath2 inferred from high energy proton - nucleus collisions is consistent with the value inferred from photoproduction experiments on nuclei .",
    "we are now ready to apply our model to nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "recall that the coherence time is determined by comparing to high energy proton - nucleus drell - yan data , and that the @xmath2 nuclear absorption is determined by comparing to proton - nucleus results .",

    "it will be very instructive to repeat this analysis in the language of partonic variables .",
    "actually , the analysis with parton energy loss alone was reported by gavin and milana @xcite with satisfactory results obtained for drell - yan if the quarks / antiquarks lose about 1.5 gev / fm . nuclear shadowing @xcite needs to be taken into account too .",

    "a systematic exploration of the freedom allowed by present parametrizations of the nucleon - nucleon experimental data is called for @xcite .",
