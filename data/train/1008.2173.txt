    "absolute moments of the riemann zeta function on the critical line have been the subject of intense theoretical investigations by hardy , littlewood , selberg , titchmarsh , and many others .",
    "it has long been conjectured that the @xmath2 moment of @xmath3 should grow like @xmath4 for some constant @xmath5 .",
    "conrey and ghosh  @xcite reformulated this long - standing conjecture in a precise form : for a fixed integer @xmath6 , @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a certain , generally understood , `` arithmetic factor , '' and @xmath9 is an integer .",
    "keating and snaith  @xcite suggested there might be relations between random matrix theory ( rmt ) and moments of the zeta function , which led them to a precise conjecture for @xmath9 .        where @xmath11 is a polynomial of degree @xmath12 with leading coefficient @xmath13 , which is the same leading coefficient as in ( [ eq : conjmoments ] ) .",
    "recently , conrey , farmer , keating , rubinstein , and snaith  @xcite gave a conjectural recipe , compatible with the keating - snaith prediction for @xmath9 , to compute lower order coefficients of @xmath11 ; see section 2 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present the results of numerical computations of integral moments of @xmath3 at relatively large heights .",
    "the main goal is to enable comparison with rmt , and other more complete predictions for moments of the zeta function on the critical line .",
    "these predictions are used to get insights that go beyond what can be derived even with the riemann hypothesis .",
    "rmt has produced a variety of ( so far still uproven ) conjectures for the zeta function .",
    "many of these conjectures have been either inspired by , or reinforced by , numerical evidence .",
    "in general , the agreement between numerical data and rmt predictions has been very good .",
    "but it is also known there are some quantities , such as the number variance in the distribution of spacings between zeta zeros , that depend explicitly on primes . therefore , for some ranges of the spacing parameter , these quantities do not follow rmt predictions exactly .    similarly , there are suggestions that the behavior of high moments of the zeta function may involve arithmetical factors such as @xmath8 in conjecture ( [ eq : conjmoments ] ) , and so might not follow the rmt predictions completely .",
    "we provide numerical data that might be used in the future to shed light on this issue . even today",
    ", the statistics we present on the variation in the moment values over various intervals might be informative in judging the extent to which rmt provides an adequate explanation for observed behavior .",
    "we computed the moments of @xmath3 for a set of 15 billion zeros near @xmath14 , and for sets of one billion zeros each near @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we also computed the moments near @xmath17 .",
    "these zero samples were used because they were the main ones available from prior computations by the second author .",
    "a relatively large sample size ( such as a billion zeros ) is useful in our study because it helps lessen the effects of sampling errors .",
    "this is an important consideration when investigating the zeta function because some aspects of its asymptotic behavior are reached very slowly ( while others are reached extremely rapidly ) .",
    "in addition , tracking data from different heights ( such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) can help us understand how the zeta function approaches its asymptotic behavior .",
    "we find that for high moments of @xmath3 , and near values of @xmath22 such as @xmath20 , the variability over adjacent intervals is substantial , even when those intervals are long , as long as a block containing @xmath0 zeros ; see table  [ allsamples ] .",
    "moreover , the variability increases rapidly with height , a tendency that is observed even for relatively low @xmath28 ( see the comments following table  [ na1 ] ) .    the leading term prediction ( [ eq : conjmoments ] ) does not match well the moment values at the heights where we carried our computations",
    "this is not surprising . as @xmath24 increases ,",
    "the leading coefficient @xmath13 becomes extremely small ( see table  [ akgk ] ) , whereas actual moments of the zeta function do grow moderately rapidly .",
    "therefore , one can not hope to get a good approximation for the actual @xmath2 moment from the leading term on its own unless @xmath22 is large enough to enable the leading power @xmath29 to compensate for the small size of the leading coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , for high moments ( relative to @xmath22 ) , the contribution of lower order terms is likely to dominate .        of the average @xmath32-errors over all 29 experiments of hp ( solid ) , ehp with @xmath33 ( short dashes ) , and normalized ehp with @xmath34 ( long dashes ) .",
