    "the simplest version of this theory ( applicable to a particle - hole symmetric system with parabolic dispersion and energy - independent impurity scattering rate ) yields the following expressions for the longitudinal and hall resistivities of a two - component system near charge neutrality :    [ theory ] @xmath56},\\ ] ] @xmath57}.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 and @xmath58 are the charge and quasiparticle densities , @xmath59 is the mobility ( which is assumed to be the same for both electrons and holes ) , @xmath60 is the sample width , @xmath61 is the zero - field resistivity , and @xmath62 is the field - dependent recombination length . assuming that the dominant recombination process is the impurity - assisted electron - phonon coupling that can occur anywhere in the sample with equal probability , the recombination length found in ref .",
    "is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath65 is the recombination time in zero magnetic field . as a result , in classically strong fields ( @xmath66 ) and for @xmath67 the magnetoresistance ( [ rxx ] ) close to the charge neutrality point is linear , @xmath68 .    using the measured parameters of our sample in the above expressions , we find that the theory predicts a magnetoresistance that is stronger than what is actually observed in our experiment .",
    "however , our results can be quantitatively described by eqs .",
    "( [ rxx ] ) and ( [ rxy ] ) if we introduce an empiric expression for the recombination length @xmath69    with @xmath70 .",
    "this modification turns out @xcite to effectively account for the following issues : ( i ) electron - hole asymmetry , ( ii ) energy dependence of the electron - hole recombination length and mobility , and ( iii ) spatial inhomogeneity of the sample . in figs .",
    "[ fig : wide ] and [ fig : mid ] we used @xmath71 .",
    "electron - hole asymmetry manifests itself in the nonzero hall resistivity at charge neutrality .",
    "moreover , for any value of the carrier density the hall resistivity is a nonmonotonous function of the magnetic field .",
    "as mentioned above , this effect also leads to the apparent drift of the charge neutrality point ( in terms of the applied gate voltage ) with the external magnetic field .    at temperatures lower than the debye energy the dominant recombination process involves electrons and holes near the bottom of the band . indeed , far away from the neutrality point , kinematic constraints preclude the `` direct '' process where an electron from the upper band is scattered into an empty state in the lower band by means of single acoustic phonon emission . instead",
    ", such `` hot '' electrons require an additional scatterer ( e.g. an impurity @xcite or a second phonon ) for recombination to take place .",
    "in contrast , electrons close to the neutrality point in bilayer graphene are slow enough so that the direct , single - phonon recombination is allowed .",
    "hence , within the kinetic equation approach @xcite the effective length scale describing the recombination processes depends on energy . similarly , the impurity scattering time or carrier mobility is strictly speaking energy - dependent as well . now , the macroscopic description of ref",
    ".   involves quantities that are averaged over the quasiparticle spectrum . taking into account the existence of the several distinct recombination processes , we arrive at the conclusion that after thermal averaging , the typical recombination length @xmath62 may be described by slightly different effective parameters as compared to , e.g. , drude conductivity .",
    "the width dependence of the carrier mobility indicates that the edge region of the sample is characterized by stronger scattering . as a result",
    ", all parameters describing electronic transport acquire an effective coordinate dependence across the sample .",
    "since in strong magnetic fields the current is mostly flowing near the sample edges @xcite , we expect that the effective recombination length @xmath62 is determined by the lower mobility typical of the near - edge region .",
    "theoretical results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : wide ] and [ fig : mid ] were obtained by using expressions ( [ theory ] ) with the parameters listed in table  [ table ] .",
    "the theory ( [ theory ] ) assumes that electrons and holes have the same mobility . while plotting figs .",
    "[ fig : wide ] and [ fig : mid ] we have treated the mobility as a free parameter instead of using the values quoted in sec .",
    "[ exp ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sample](a ) ) since experimentally one can reliably determine mobility only far away from the neutrality point , where the classical hall resistivity exhibits the standard behavior @xmath72 .",
    "close to charge neutrality , the mobility may deviate from such experimental values due to electron - hole interaction processes similar to the drag effect . far away from charge neutrality",
    "this interaction is ineffective since with exponential accuracy only one band is partially filled and contributes to low - energy physics . in contrast , close to the neutrality point , both electrons and holes participate in transport and hence one has to take into account their mutual scattering .",
    "the resulting change of the mobility does not exceed 50% in accordance to theoretical expectations .",
    "the values of the recombination length @xmath73 shown in table  [ table ] show significant dependence on the sample width ( roughly , @xmath74 ) .",
    "we interpret this observation as an indication of a much larger recombination length that would characterize a very large ( in theory  infinite ) sample ( if it were possible to fabricate without strong structural disorder @xcite ) . assuming that the electron - hole recombination is dominated by electron - phonon interaction ( either impurity- or edge - assisted )",
    ", we argue that in narrow samples the phonon spectrum is modified ( compared to an idealized infinite system ) , leading to a much shorter recombination length of the order of the sample width .",
    "the hall resistance ( [ rxy ] ) is expected to vanish at the neutrality point . however , as we have already mentioned , in our sample the neutrality point shifts toward higher gate voltages when a strong magnetic field is applied . in order to account for this effect",
    ", we have used the ratio @xmath75 to extract the field - dependent quantity @xmath76 from the experimental data . using",
    "thus obtained dependence in eq .",
    "( [ rxy ] ) , we find good quantitative agreement between the calculated and measured values , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wide ] . at the same time",
    ", the longitudinal resistivity ( [ rxx ] ) is much less sensitive to small deviations of density . using the extracted values of @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ rxx ] ) does not lead to visible changes in the calculated curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wide ] .",
    "the shift of cnp with magnetic field was observed directly , see figs .",
    "[ fig : sample ] and [ fig : fan ] . assuming that the maximum of the longitudinal resistivity corresponds to cnp",
    ", we can extract the field dependence of the chemical potential ( and hence , carrier densities ) from the data .",
    "using thus obtained dependence , we recalculated the hall resistance , see the brown curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : wide](b ) .",
    "the result shows reasonable agreement with the data , with the visible deviations may stem from the mismatch of temperatures in the two data sets in figs .",
    "[ fig : fan ] and [ fig : wide ] ( @xmath77k and @xmath78k , respectively ) .",
    "finally , away from the neutrality point the data shows a tendency towards saturation in high magnetic fields , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mid](b ) .",
    "the theoretical fits where performed with a set of parameters depending on the gate voltage and taking into account the shift of cnp with magnetic field . in particular , the mobility appeared to show a slight increase from @xmath79m@xmath80/vs ( close to cnp , see table  [ table ] ) to @xmath81m@xmath80/vs at @xmath82v . at the same time , in that range of gate voltages the recombination length @xmath73 appears to be almost unchanged from the value shown in table  [ table ] ) .",
