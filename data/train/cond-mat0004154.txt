    "the recent development of artificial free - standing structures of nanometer dimensions has led to great interest in their mechanical properties .",
    "a wealth of experimental information is now available for nanowires @xcite and nanotubes@xcite , and a computational literature is developing on the subject@xcite .",
    "many of these works make use of results from the continuum theory of elasticity to analyze the behavior of nanometer structures .",
    "however , the applicability of continuum theories to nanoscale objects , where atomic - level inhomogeneities come to the fore , has yet to be explored in depth .",
    "rigorous understanding of the elastic properties of nanoscale systems is crucial in understanding their mechanical behavior and presents an intriguing theoretical challenge lying at the cross - over between the atomic level and the continuum . in the absence of an appropriate theoretical description at this cross - over ,",
    "critical questions remain to be answered including the extent to which continuum theories can be pushed into the nanoregime , how to provide systematic corrections to continuum theory , what effects do different bonding arrangements have on elastic response , and what signatures in the electronic structure correlate with the mechanical properties of the overall structure ?",
    "recently , there have been a number of theoretical explorations of the impact of nanoscale structure on mechanical properties@xcite .",
    "these studies fall under two broad approaches , either the addition of surface and edge corrections to bulk continuum theories@xcite or the extraction of overall mechanical response from atomic scale interactions@xcite .",
    "the latter approach has the distinct advantage of allowing first principles understanding of how different chemical groups and bonding arrangements contribute to overall elastic response , thus opening the potential for the rational design of nanostructures with specific properties .",
    "in coarse graining from interatomic interactions to mechanical response , some works rely upon the problematic decomposition of the total system energy into a direct sum of atomic energies@xcite , which is always arbitrary and particularly inconvenient for connection with _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations . the remaining works which attempt to build up overall response from atomic level contributions@xcite fail to account properly for the poisson effect . below",
    "we show that failure to account for this effect leads to surprisingly unphysical results .",
    "this manuscript presents the first theory for the analysis of overall mechanical response in terms of atomic - level observables which suffers from neither difficulty from the preceding paragraph .",
    "this analysis allows , for the first time , quantitative understanding of how continuum theory breaks down on the nanoscale , of how to make appropriate corrections , and of how to predict the effects of different bonding arrangements on overall elastic response .",
    "it is well known that the decomposition of overall elastic response into a sum of atomic level contributions is not unique .",
    "we show here , however , that with the additional constraint of dependence of moduli on local environment our definition of atomic level moduli becomes physically meaningful and essentially unique when coarse - grained over regions of extent comparable to the decay range of the force - constant matrix .    for concreteness , in this work",
    "we focus on nanowires .",
    "however , we will also describe briefly how this work can be extended to any system with nanometer dimensions .",
    "the manuscript proceeds as follows .",
    "section  [ overview ] briefly overviews the present state of the field .",
    "next , as the traditional concept of young s modulus becomes ill - defined on the nanoscale , we begin by carefully defining continuum elastic constants appropriate for nanowires in section  [ sec - nr ] .",
    "we then show how to decompose these constants exactly into atomic - level contributions based on true physical observables ( rather than individual atomic energies ) using a straight - forward application of born and huang s method of long waves  @xcite , resulting in a decomposition similar in spirit to those in references  [ 17 ]  and  [ 18 ] ( section  [ sec - mlw ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec - fail ] demonstrates the surprising , radical breakdown of this approach when applied to nanoresonators .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - mlwn ] , we identify the source of the difficulty as the poisson effect and present the first analysis of mechanical response truly applicable to nanoresonators .",
    "the manuscript then goes on to applications .",
    "section  [ sec - trans ] verifies the physical meaningfulness of our newly defined quantities by verifying that they predict response to modes of strain for which they were not directly constructed .",
    "we then , in section  [ sec - fte ] , use our approach to generate a new , much more accurate , relationship between experimentally accessible observables describing response to flexural and extensional strain in nanomechanical resonators .",
    "finally , section  [ sec - cbames ] uses this theory to explore possible links between underlying electronic structure and local elastic response .",
    "as the introduction mentions , the literature pursues two broad categories of approach to the study of mechanical properties on the nanoscale , either surface and edge corrections to continuum theory or extraction of overall response from the underlying atomic interactions . in the former category ,",
    "reference [ 13 ] , through scaling arguments and numerical examples , notes that the young s modulus for nanomechanical resonators scales as a bulk term plus surface and edge corrections .",
    "although providing insight and motivation , this work leaves completely open how one should understand these corrections from first principles .",
    "reference [ 14 ] provides a more rigorous study based on separating nanoscale systems into continuum surface and bulk regions .",
    "this latter approach allows prediction of changes in stiffness properties as one approaches nanometer length scales and has the appeal of generating physically motivated correction terms .",
    "however , it relies on the separation of a nanomechanical resonator into bulk and surface continua as an _ ansatz _ and therefore neither predicts when such a picture suffices to give an accurate description nor prescribes further corrections .",
    "references [ 15 - 18 ] , on the other hand , start from the more general atomic level description and then try to unveil physical properties from the underlying atomic description .",
    "it is important to note that these works do not deal directly with nanoscale systems but rather focus on the effects of nanoscale inhomogeneities in _ bulk _ systems .",
    "references [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] concern the elastic properties of grain boundaries .",
    "these works define atomic - level elastic moduli as the second derivative of the energy associated with each atom with respect to strain and then go on to study the behavior of such moduli near grain boundaries .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is that it requires a breakdown into individual contributions from each atom of the total energy of any system .",
    "such an atomic energy is neither observable nor uniquely defined and therefore can not serve as an appropriate basis for theoretical understanding .    although references [ 17 ] and [ 18 ] work from valid physical observables , the components of the force - constant matrix , these works focus on bulk - like or mesoscopic scale systems and fail for nanoscale systems for the reasons which we describe in this work . reference",
    "[ 17 ] investigates nonlocal elastic constants on the mesoscopic scale and links them to the underlying atomic interactions .",
    "it then proceeds to define an elastic constant for each atom and studies the behavior of these quantities near surfaces and grain boundaries .",
    "reference [ 18 ] defines a bond frequency from the force - constant matrix from which it deduces the possibility of bond rupture during crack nucleation .",
    "neither of the above works properly accounts for the poisson effect , which we show in sections  [ sec - mlw ] ,  [ sec - fail ]  and  [ sec - mlwn ] to play a critical role in the elasticity of nanoscale systems .",
    "moreover , straightforward generalization of these works to include this effect fail for the the same reasons as does the related approach which we describe in section  [ sec - mlw ] .",
    "the prime difficulty in the application of continuum theory to objects of nanometer cross - section is the loss of the ratio of the inter - atomic spacing to the cross - sectional dimension as a small parameter .",
    "however , so long as the length of an object and the wavelength of the distortions considered both greatly exceed the inter - atomic spacing and the cross - sectional dimension , the object properly may be viewed as a one - dimensional continuum .",
    "although we focus in this work on nanowires , the generalization of the discussion below to nanoscale systems of other dimensionality such as thin plates or nanoscopic objects is straightforward .",
    "viewed as a linear continuum , the free energy per unit length @xmath0 of a nanowire is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the linear strain of extension , @xmath3 is the radius of curvature and @xmath4 is the rate of twist of the torsion .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath5 is the _ extensional rigidity _ , @xmath6 is the _ flexural rigidity _ and @xmath7 is the _",
    "torsional rigidity_. unlike traditional bulk continuum concepts , the free - energy function eq .",
    "( [ eqn : free ] ) is observable in principle and thus provides an unambiguous operational definition of the rigidities .",
    "we avoid the use of traditional continuum concepts , such as the young s modulus and the cross - sectional area , because such concepts are neither uniquely nor well - defined for nanoscale systems .    the rigidities in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : free ] ) are related to the phonon frequencies through @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the frequency for either the longitudinal , transverse or rotational acoustic modes , respectively , @xmath10 is the linear atomic number density , @xmath11 is the wave vector and @xmath12 is the mass of a single atom .",
    "( this work focuses on single species systems for simplicity . )",
    "finally , @xmath13 is defined unambiguously as the mean rotational moment @xmath14 , where the sum ranges over all atoms in the cell , @xmath15 is the number of atoms per unit cell , the wire is assumed to run along the @xmath16-axis and the origin lies on the center line of the wire .",
    "finally we note that although the rigidities in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : free ] ) are well - defined , certain traditional continuum relations between them do not hold .",
    "specifically , we will show below that the traditional continuum relationship between the extensional rigidity @xmath5 and the flexural rigidity @xmath6 fails on the nanoscale , similar to relations which have been recently used in the analysis of experiments@xcite .",
    "one reason for breakdown of traditional continuum relations on the nanoscale is that the continuum perspective course grains away important fluctuations which occur over distances on the order of the inter - atomic spacing . to overcome this shortcoming",
    ", we propose to coarse grain only on distances over which the underlying interatomic interactions vary , the decay length of the force - constant matrix . the straightforward approach to generate such",
    "a theory is the `` method of long waves '' developed by born and huang@xcite , which is somewhat similar to the approaches which have been used previously to defects in bulk systems@xcite .",
    "this section applies the method of long waves to nanoresonators .",
    "the next section shows how , surprisingly , this and related approaches fail in the study of systems with free surfaces and therefore , in general , can not be used to describe nanoscale systems . in section  [ sec - mlwn ] , we describe how to go beyond the straightforward application of the `` method of long waves '' in order to achieve a meaningful description .",
    "we focus initially on longitudinal waves and , as noted in section  [ sec - nr ] , choose our origin to lie on the center line of the wire , which we let run along the @xmath16-axis . for nanowires ,",

    "this implies that the first - order polarization vector ( @xmath43}_{\\alpha}$ ] ) is uniform from primitive cell to primitive cell and thus depends only on the local environment of each atom .",
    "next , we note that although the strain terms ( @xmath44 ) scale linearly with distance between atoms , the terms which contribute to the final result are bounded in range by the inter - atomic interactions ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "to cure the difficulties uncovered in the previous section , we proceed by first identifying the cause of the pathological behavior and then exploiting the freedom in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : atmod_sf ] ) to remove this pathology .",
    "the failure of the straightforward approach arises from the fact that elastic waves in nanoresonators , or any system with free surfaces , are not strictly planar .",

    "there are three logical choices for the poisson ratios : some sort of local atomic definition , an overall average for the wire , or the bulk values .",
    "we choose to use bulk poisson ratios for a number of reasons .",
    "first , a locally varying definition makes it impossible to exploit the continuous rotational and translational symmetries in the dynamical matrix , which we find necessary to employ below in constructing atomic moduli with local behavior .",
    "second , only by employing the bulk ( rather than average ) poisson ratios do we find a definition which approaches the appropriate bulk value in the centers of wires of finite width .",
    "finally , we note that we always have the freedom of working with bulk poisson ratios because any motion along the surface in addition to that resulting from bulk poisson effect will not scale extensively with the diameter of the wire and can therefore be incorporated into the intensive atomic .    after making the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : decomp ] ) , we next employ the continuous rotational and translational symmetries of the dynamical matrix to eliminate all extensive dependencies in eq .",

    "this new construction ensures that the modulus of each atom depends only upon its local atomic environment because @xmath68 no longer includes extensive motions and , although @xmath69 still depends on relative atomic distances , the renormalized @xmath70 decays as @xmath71 does .",
    "thus , it is now the range of the force - constant matrix which controls the size of the neighborhood upon which each atomic modulus can depend . therefore , the moduli of atoms in the interior now _ must _ correspond to the expected bulk value , the moduli of the atoms on the surface now _ can not _ depend upon the extent of the system , and",

    "any other definition _ which respects locality _ can only redistribute portions of each atom s modulus among other atoms within a region of extent comparable to the decay of the force - constant matrix .",
    "any sum over such a region of the moduli will always be nearly the same .",
    "therefore , coarse grained over such regions , properly localized atomic moduli become physically meaningful .",
    "section  [ sec - trans ] and appendix  [ sec - appb ] demonstrate this explicitly by comparing the predictions for flexion from either properly localized moduli or straightforwardly defined moduli , respectively . to further demonstrate that alternate local definitions are equivalent in this coarse - grained sense , we have explored alternate local constructions . in particular , while our present construction takes care to employ the continuous symmetries of the dynamical matrix in such a way so as to respect symmetry among the @xmath72 cartesian coordinates , we have also repeated the construction while treating the @xmath73 coordinates symmetrically but not the @xmath16 coordinate and have found nearly identical results for all of the applications below .",

    ", the nature of the poisson effect depends upon the mode of loading , and the system should treated as either of the above cases accordingly .",

    "( [ eqn : error ] ) , but not in the traditional continuum relation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : errorct ] ) . from this analysis",
    ", we see that the reason why the traditional continuum relation has larger errors is that it does not properly differentiate between the local surface and bulk environments .",
    "the atomic moduli also lead to a quick , intuitive argument to understand the improvement of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : atefromf ] ) over eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cnte ] ) . from our results",
    "we know that the surface moduli can be quite different than those of the bulk .",
    "it is also known that flexion places larger emphasis on the surface than does extension .",
    "if the average surface modulus is less / more than that of the bulk then the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : atefromf ] ) ( @xmath115 ) will underestimate / overestimate the extensional rigidity , while the second term will overestimate / underestimate it .",
    "therefore , errors will tend to cancel in the average of the two .",
    "we now explore the local atomic moduli as a link between local elastic properties and the underlying electronic structure . to do this , we have calculated the atomic moduli , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : atmod ] ) , for both the @xmath51 and @xmath116 structures , using the sawada  @xcite tight - binding model with modifications proposed by kohyama@xcite .",
    "we have studied various wires , all of which give similar results . for brevity ,",
    "we here only report on wires with cross - sectional diameter @xmath117 nm . the supercell of our calculation is four bulk cubic lattice constants long in the periodic direction , and hence sampling the brillouin zone at the @xmath118 point in the electronic structure calculations is more than sufficient .",
    "the left panels of figures  [ fig : tbc2x2 ]  and  [ fig : tb2x1 ] show the resulting atomic moduli , with values color coded so that yellow corresponds to the bulk value ( 17.1 ev / atom ) .",
    "the figure shows that deviations from this value concentrate near the surface in patterns characteristic of the structure of the wire .",
    "moduli near the surface fluctuate widely , ranging from 6 - 27 ev / atom for the @xmath51 structure and from 4 - 26 ev / atom for the @xmath119 structure .    to allow comparison with the underlying electronic structure , the right panels in the figures display the valence charge densities from the tight - binding calculation projected ( integrated along the wire axis ) onto the cross - section of the wire .",
    "( to compute the electron density from the tight - binding coefficients , we employed orbitals from a density functional calculation of the silicon atom . )",
    "the figures display the electron densities using a color map similar to that employed for the atomic moduli .",
    "intriguingly , there is an apparent correlation between the values of the atomic moduli and the underlying electron density . in particular , large / small atomic moduli correlate with regions of large / small electron density in figure  [ fig : tbc2x2 ] , indicating that charge distribution along the surface of these wires greatly affects the local elastic properties and thereby the overall elastic response , particularly to flexion which emphasizes surface effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : tb2x1 ] exhibits a similar correlation , but not as pronounced . note that , in this figure , coincidence of red atomic moduli just under the surfaces of the first layer of atoms correlates with red charge densities in the same location .",
    "unlike in the classical potential case , where properly defined surface moduli are systematically lower or equal to the bulk value due to decrease in the number of bonds ( figure  [ fig : ecomp]b ) , we find that in a quantum model , surface moduli may even greatly exceed the bulk value due to changes in local charge density which can enhance the mechanical strength of bonds ( figures  [ fig : tbc2x2 ]  and  [ fig : tb2x1 ] . )",
    "this contrast underscores both the importance of considering contributions of the electronic structure to mechanical response and the need for a definition of atomic moduli which can be computed from physical observables obtainable from electronic structure calculations .",
    "the ultimate use of atomic level moduli is to understand mechanical response .",
    "table  [ table : tab1 ] compares the errors from both continuum theory and the use of atomic - level moduli in predicting mechanical response for the two wires under consideration in this section .",
    "the quantities compared exactly parallel those of the previous section .",
    "the first two columns of the table consider prediction of flexural response from continuum theory and our atomic moduli , respectively , and the second two columns consider prediction of extensional response from flexural response using either the traditional continuum relation or our new relation , respectively .",
    "the table shows that the new relations , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : atmof ] )  and  ( [ eqn : atefromf ] ) are again very accurate .",
    "the table also shows that these predictions are superior to the corresponding continuum results , eqs .",

    "( [ eqn : cnte ] )  and  ( [ eqn : atefromf ] ) ( third and fourth columns , respectively ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     interestingly , the continuum predictions for the @xmath51 wire are fairly reliable .",
    "the atomic moduli provide an avenue for understanding this as well .",
    "fluctuations in the moduli in the @xmath51 wires are localized and hence average out over regions of extent comparable to the decay of the force - constant matrix . moreover , in this particular case they tend to average to values close to that expected of the bulk . without meaningful fluctuations on the length scales of the decay of the force - constant matrix , we expect continuum theory to perform well for this wire . in contrast , the @xmath120 wire exhibits much more systematic variations in the moduli .",
    "the outermost surface atoms have a consistent and significantly reduced modulus , and there is also a clear significant and systematic variation in the moduli throughout the cross - section of the wire .",
    "because this second wire does exhibit meaningful fluctuation over distances comparable to the decay range of the force constant matrix , we expect traditional continuum relations to give particularly poor results , underscoring the importance of the local atomic - level moduli description .",
    "this manuscript presents the first definition of atomic - level elastic moduli for nanoscale systems which are defined in terms of physical observables , correctly sum to give the exact overall elastic response and depend only on the local environment of each atom .",
    "although these moduli are not necessarily uniquely defined , their sum over regions of extent comparable to the range of the force constant matrix is physically meaningful and may be used to make accurate predictions of mechanical response .",
    "the moduli resulting from our formulation transfer to different modes of strain and correctly account for elastic fluctuations on the nanoscale .",
    "they also lead to a quantitative understanding of when traditional continuum relations breakdown and how to properly correct them properly .",
    "specifically , we demonstrated a more accurate method for relating extensional and flexural properties .",
    "these moduli provide a clear and natural method for distinguishing _ mechanically _ between `` surface '' atoms and `` bulk '' atoms and give insight into the correlation between the local mechanical response and the underlying electronic structure .",
    "finally , these moduli allow the identification of which atomic arrangements lead to more pliant or stiffer response opening the possibility of their use as a tool to aid in the rational design of nanostructures with specific mechanical properties .",
