    "mepds which emerge from generalized measures , like tsallis @xcite and renyi @xcite entropies , subjected to jaynes maximum entropy principle , i.e. constrained by a q - generalized ( or escort ) energy mean value and the normalization condition , are expressed in terms of q - deformed generalized exponential functions of the energy microstates ( also called `` q - maxent distributions '' ) .",
    "if these mepds are supposed to have a physical and statistical meaning , then they must be real and positive .",
    "the q - exponential function however is not always a real and positive quantity .",
    "usually , to avoid negative or complex values of the microstate probabilities for some energy values , one introduces cut - off prescriptions .",
    "one example of this is the `` tsallis cut - off prescription '' @xcite which simply sets @xmath2 whenever this is the case .",
    "this is not necessarily an ad - hoc requirement .",
    "for instance in self - gravitating systems , as in the case of stellar polytropic distributions , cut - offs arise naturally and correspond to a gravitational escape velocity @xcite .",
    "another scenario leading naturally to tsallis cut - off is the case of a system s with energy levels @xmath3 coupled to a finite heat - bath b with quasi - continuous energy level distributions .",
    "a. r. plastino and a. plastino showed @xcite that if the heat - bath s number of states with energy less or equal than , say e , increases as a power law of e , then tsallis cut - off implies the obvious fact that the probability to find the system with energy @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the total energy of the `` total '' system s+b , is zero .    however , there are other systems where one has no reason to set a priori a cut - off on the energy levels ( e.g. on asymptotic behaviors like in a maxwellian velocity distribution or a black body radiation curve or other quantum distributions ) . for these kind of situations",
    "teweldeberhan , plastino and miller @xcite suggested to redefine the q - generalized exponential function itself such that `` _ _ it leads , via the maximum entropy principle , to quantum distribution functions that have been very successful in the study of a concrete and important physical phenomena : high @xmath6 superconductivity _ _ '' , and working with this special case the thermodynamical consistency of their cut - off prescription is shown .",
    "proposing alternative definitions of the q - exponential function as has done in this case is one possible way and is inescapable if one wants to maintain a continuously varying @xmath7-parameter .",
    "however , we might also wonder which are the discrete values of the @xmath7-parameter for which the generalized exponential remains nevertheless always real and positive such that no cut - off and no redefinition of the q - exponential function is needed .    here",
    "we will investigate for this purpose the deformed logarithm - exponential representation of probability distributions ( pd ) and entropy measures subjected to jaynes mep focussing our attention on the dual description of generalized statistics .",
    "we will first study some properties of the generalized exponential and logarithmic function and , investigating the domain where the former maintains itself real and positive , outline what role the known dualities @xmath8 and @xmath1 play .",
    "this will then be applied to microcanonical pds and @xmath7-deformed generalized entropy measures .",
    "we will show how these q - generalized entropy measures and mepds with no cut - off prescriptions ( i.e. no energy constraints ) are positive and real ( as any meaningful physical measure should be ) only for discrete values of the @xmath7-parameter and will determine these explicitly .",
    "throughout the literature the application of the @xmath7-deformed generalized exponential and logarithm function has become commonplace .",
    "as it is well known the usual euler exponential @xmath9 can be defined as the solution of the differential equation @xmath10 .",
    "the q - deformed exponential can be regarded as a generalization in the sense that it can be obtained from the solution of @xmath11 and initial condition @xmath12 , with @xmath7 a real parameter , as @xmath13=[1+(1-q)x]^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\ , , \\label{q - exp}\\ ] ] which becomes the exponential function for @xmath14 .",
    "the inverse of the q - exponential is the _ generalized q - logarithm function _",
    "@xmath15 which , for @xmath14 , becomes the common napier logarithm .",
    "useful for our purposes will be the fact that @xmath16 = e_{q } [ \\gamma x ] \\ , e_{q } [ y ] \\ , \\ , ; \\hspace{15 mm } \\forall x , y \\in \\mathbb{r } \\label{q - shift}\\ ] ] with @xmath17    there are many indications @xcite which suggest that statistical theories based on functionals of power law pds ( or probability density functions ) obeying ( [ q - expd ] ) describe correctly several complex systems .",
    "now , the generalized exponential ( [ q - exp ] ) is a quantity of type @xmath18 = a(x , q)^{b(q)}$ ] with @xmath19 and which can take real or complex , positive or negative values according to what we choose for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath20 is a real and positive quantity for some @xmath22 , then @xmath23 is always real for every @xmath24 , i.e. for every @xmath7 such that @xmath18=[1+(1-q)x]^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}$ ] remains real and positive .",
    "but once an interval @xmath25 $ ] for @xmath26 is chosen , also a continuous interval @xmath27 $ ] is fixed so that @xmath28 always .",
    "while for every @xmath7 outside @xmath29 it is @xmath30 , @xmath31 . in this case",
    "@xmath18 $ ] might become complex . to know where this precisely does _ not _ occur we can write @xmath32=a(x , q)^{b(q)}= ( -1)^{b(q ) } |a(x , q)|^{b(q ) } = e^{i\\pi b(q ) } |a(x , q)|^{b(q ) } \\ , , \\ ] ] which is real if and only if @xmath33 for every @xmath34 ( and is positive for @xmath35 even and negative for @xmath35 odd ) .",

    "the q - exponential is always positive for @xmath35 even ( fig.1 with @xmath40 , and fig.2 with @xmath41 ) , i.e. given @xmath42 for all @xmath43 it can become negative if @xmath35 is odd ( fig.3 with @xmath44 , and fig.4 with @xmath45 ) , i.e. given @xmath46 for all @xmath47 where @xmath14 is a point of accumulation of the discrete spectrum .",
    "\\approx e^{x}$ ] for @xmath48 , must be done cautiously since @xmath18 $ ] can diverge in some regions from euler s exponential for every value which is not exactly @xmath14 . on the other side , if pd are expressed with q - exponentials , the infinities for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( in fig",
    ". 2 and fig.4 ) might at first look worrisome .",
    "however , as we will see later , the partition function of mepds renormalizes these divergences ( see eq .",
    "[ pitotal2 ] ) .",
    "the discontinuities of the q - exponential should cause no concern for stationary _ normalized _ pds . ]    therefore , in general , outside the continuous parameter space for @xmath7 , in order to maintain a generalized exponential to be a real quantity on all the domain @xmath37 , only discrete values of @xmath51 are allowed .",
    "now , note also how there exists ( except , of course , for the special case @xmath52 ) a one - to - one correspondence @xmath53",
    "( i.e. the fig.1@xmath54fig.4 and fig.2@xmath54fig.3 correspondences ) of the discrete spectrum between the real even ( always positive ) and a real odd ( negative somewhere ) generalized exponential function .",
    "also a @xmath55 correspondence between the two always positive ( fig.1 @xmath54 fig.2 ) and the two sign - changing ( fig.3 @xmath54 fig.4 ) generalized exponentials is established .",
    "these are reminiscent of the @xmath0 and @xmath56 dualities first noted by tsallis , mendes and platino @xcite ( and further investigated by naudts@xcite , abe and okomoto@xcite , frank and plastino@xcite and others ) , and acquire here a new meaning .",
    "then it is quite natural to search for the bijections between fig.1@xmath54fig.3 and fig.2@xmath54fig.4 ( i.e. between the sign - changing and the always positive generalized exponentials ) .",
    "these are given by the @xmath57 correspondence ( fig.3 @xmath58 fig.1 and fig.4 @xmath58 fig.2 ) , and @xmath59 ( fig.1 @xmath58 fig.3 and fig.2 @xmath58 fig.4 ) .    all these are correspondences which have their roots in in the complex coniugate @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "however , the @xmath62 and @xmath63 transformations are involutions , while @xmath64 and @xmath65 are clearly not .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 appear to be more fundamental in the sense that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are a composition of the first two .",
    "one can of course construct an infinite number of correspondences between the discrete spectra but only as compositions of these .",
    "and another decisive difference is that these represent a transformation between a @xmath49 and @xmath66 statistics , while @xmath64 and @xmath65 always map on the same @xmath66 or @xmath49 statistics .    putting all this together",
    "we can finally say that two possibilities exist .",

    "so far we were concerned with things from a purely analytic point of view .",
    "we can now direct our attention to generalized exponentials in the frame of entropies and microcanonical probabilities .",
    "in statistical physics entropy can be defined as the logarithm of the phase space volume ( @xmath87-space ) of the entire system @xmath88 in order to show that what we are trying to do has a validity which goes beyond tsallis entropy , we keep very general to any form of entropy measures which lead to q - exponential mepds .",

    "one obtains tsallis entropy , if @xmath94 we have @xmath95 which is renyi s entropy @xcite , while in general [ eqit ] can be recognized as the less known entropy of b.d sharma and d.p mittal @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that [ eqit ] is the most general pseudo - additive measure which includes tsallis and renyi entropies based on escort averages statistics admitting of a partition function(@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this `` @xmath96 exp@xmath97''-form representation will later make it easier to recognize the @xmath7-spectrum of @xmath98 .",
    "now , one can check @xcite with the method of the lagrangian multipliers that , applying jaynes maximum entropy principle , the generalized mepds are ( lets label with @xmath99 the stationary pds of family @xmath100)@xmath101}{z(\\widehat{p } ) } \\ , , \\label{pitotal2}\\ ] ] with @xmath102\\ ] ] a generalized partition function , where @xmath103 is the j - th energy microstate , @xmath104 the mean energy of the system and @xmath105 the generalized lagrangian parameter ( the inverse temperature in bg - statistics ) .",
    "the @xmath89-parameter gets absorbed in @xmath105 .",
    "it might be useful to recall that expressions like that in [ pitotal2 ] are invariant under the choice of the mean energy @xmath104 .",

    "mepds [ pitotal2 ] are in form of generalized exponentials and must therefore have for every parameter @xmath7 their real dominion .",
    "( [ pizen ] ) is especially useful to evaluate for which values of @xmath7 the microstate probabilities , @xmath99 , with no energy cut - off , are always real and positive .",
    "if we consider @xmath109 being positive , then we are dealing with the case ( [ eqr- ] ) is [ eqr+ ] and is more delicate since it implies negative temperatures if one considers the lagrangian parameter proportional to an inverse temperature .",
    "we will not consider the physical implications of this here , but analytically one proceeds in the same way . ] and must conclude that if we want the generalized optimized pds to have statistical and physical significance , i.e. to be real and positive on all @xmath110 ( @xmath35 even ) , then we are forced to restrict our choice to a continuous parameter spectrum @xmath111 or on a discrete parameter spectrum @xmath112    on the other side consider the q - generalized @xmath87-space of the entropy in its `` @xmath113 exp@xmath97''-form , @xmath114 .",
    "also the phase space volume and tsallis entropy are supposed to be a statistical meaningful physical quantity only if they are real and positive .",
    "if no cut - off is imposed on the entropy and since @xmath115 , then case ( [ eqr+ ] ) determines the @xmath116spectrum as @xmath117 and @xmath118    putting this together , we can say that any physically meaningful generalized q - exponential statistics based on jaynes maximum entropy principle ( i.e. with entropies and the associated mepd s as real and positive scalars ) with no cut - off prescriptions must be restricted to case ( [ eqr-+ ] ) and the @xmath7-deforming spectrum can have only discrete values @xmath119 with @xmath14 a point of accumulation .",
    "this was a strictly formal treatment and in the frame of a thermostatistical reasoning this does of course not show that nature chooses just the values for q of ( [ finalspectrum ] ) .",
    "but if so , also the energy states of systems described by this statistics must be discrete . since , in some physical systems , there are no physical reasons to introduce a priori energy cut - offs",
    ", one can conjecture that these parameters might be preferred over others .",
    "this might give also a hint for further experimental work that tries to highlight if nature indeed prefers to be described by general exponentials or not . because the necessity to introduce cut - offs can also suggest that the generalized exponential function is not the correct , or only an approximate form to describe an extended statistics .",
    "empiric evidence is to our knowledge so far still affected by too much incertitude .",
    "however , the best experimental and statistical measurement we are aware of might be the work of silva , alcaniz and lima @xcite with plasma oscillation data who claim to have obtained a value of @xmath120 at 95% confidence level .",
    "this would be in line with our value @xmath121 of course only further experimental evidence can confirm or dismiss this hypothesis .",
    "we studied the q - parameter ( continuous and discrete ) spectrum on which a generalized exponential is real and positive and concluded that assuming that jaynes maximum entropy principle holds also in a generalized q - statistics , if we want to have physically meaningful real and positive mepds and entropy scalars on an energy range without cut - off prescriptions , then only discrete parameters @xmath122 $ ] are allowed .",
