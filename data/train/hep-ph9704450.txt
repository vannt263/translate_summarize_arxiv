    "how might superpartners be detected if they exist ? they could be found in direct production at colliders as energy or luminosity is increased and a threshold is crossed in either . observing them",
    "of course requires triggering on such events , and separating the signal from backgrounds . or , their effects could be seen from one - loop contributions .",
    "most possible deviations from the , whether particle production or loop effects , could not be interpreted as signals of supersymmetry , since supersymmetric signals are strongly constrained as to which processes they can contribute to .",
    "for example , susy production events should have missing energy ( assuming @xmath7-parity conservation ) , while deviations caused by loop effects should show up most strongly in processes such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( but _ not _  in @xmath10 quark asymmetries ) .    in the past couple of years",
    "some evidence of such effects has been reported@xcite .",
    "here we do not wish to describe this evidence or argue that it is , in fact , evidence for superparticles , but to observe that it can only be interpreted as such evidence and be consistent with all existing data if certain parameters lie in certain ranges .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to study the predictions of models with such parameters .",
    "we can summarize these ranges approximately by & & m_1 m_2 m_z < , > > , & & 45 65 .",
    "[ massh ] here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ( unsigned ) neutralino and chargino mass eigenvalues , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the left and right charged slepton masses , @xmath15 is the sneutrino mass , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the @xmath18 and @xmath19 gaugino masses at the electroweak scale , @xmath20 is the coefficient of the @xmath21 term in the superpotential at the electroweak scale , and @xmath5 is the ratio of the higgs vevs .",
    "we also take the right slepton mass @xmath14 to be of order 125 gev , but this choice only indirectly affects the lep analysis .",
    "we further impose @xmath22 , so that we qualitatively expect events such as @xmath23 at fermilab@xcite .",
    "the models discussed here do not depend on the light stop mass indicated in  ( [ inputs ] ) for their interest .",
    "however , the relative size of @xmath24 and @xmath25 affects the signatures considerably , so we examine all cases .",
    "we use the word `` models '' to denote different choices of the above parameters , all constrained to be in the ranges specified by  ( [ inputs ] ) and  ( [ massh ] ) .",
    "our entire analysis is in terms of an effective general lagrangian at the weak scale , including soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "the scenario defined by ( [ inputs ] ) is at present a well - motivated one to study for its implications for signals at lep ( and fermilab ) , and that is the purpose of this paper .",
    "further , the detectable signatures for lep are rather non - standard .",
    "for example , the largest susy signals may occur as events with two photons and large missing energy , an excess of single photon events with recoil mass above about 140 gev , an excess of events with two soft charged leptons and large missing energy , etc . even though some superpartner production cross sections are large ( of order 1 picobarn ) , giving hundreds of produced events , most are simply invisible !",
    "the signals that have been most often studied from charginos and neutralinos are relatively small in this scenario . the key features which give these models their unique character are large branching ratios to invisible final states of the sneutrinos and @xmath26 , as well as a significant branching ratio for the radiative decay of @xmath27 . in the following we",
    "first summarize the masses and decays predicted for individual superpartners , and then describe the resulting cross sections and signatures .",
    "table  [ decays ] summarizes the properties of the relevant superpartners .",
    "the constraints in eq .",
    "( [ inputs ] ) imply@xcite that @xmath28 is dominantly higgsino ( the approximately symmetric combination of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , @xmath27 is mainly photino , and @xmath26 is mostly antisymmetric higgsino , but with a non - negligible zino component .",
    "the charginos are neither pure wino nor pure charged higgsino ( the @xmath31 mixing matrix is approximately off - diagonal , while all of the @xmath32 mixing matrix elements are roughly the same magnitude ) .",
    "all of the results of table  [ decays ] follow straightforwardly .",
    "we have included a row for the stop since it is motivated if there are deviations from the  in @xmath33 and @xmath34@xcite , by electroweak baryogenesis@xcite , and to some observers by aspects of fermilab data@xcite . however , the crucial features of the class of models we are studying do not change if we take the stop mass to be heavier than indicated in table  [ decays ] .    as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , an important feature of the susy parameters chosen in  ( [ inputs ] ) is a large value of @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , photons will play a significant role in the signals within this class of models .",
    "the remainder of the @xmath27 decay rate is to 3-body final states . of the possible",
    "3-body decays , @xmath36 has the largest branching ratio , because of the relatively low slepton masses .",
    "a key result of the mass hierarchy  ( [ massh ] ) concerns the sneutrino decay modes .",
    "the only two - body modes open are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , the decay to @xmath39 dominates , rendering the sneutrino almost entirely invisible . likewise , since @xmath40 dominates , @xmath26 is also mainly invisible .",
    "since @xmath41 and @xmath42 are among the largest cross sections , most sparticle production at lep is invisible .",
    "when @xmath43 or @xmath26 do have a visible decay , it contains a single @xmath44 , or possibly @xmath45 .",
    "the heaviest neutralino , @xmath46 , has decays which are very similar to @xmath26 .",
    "the dominant @xmath46 decay mode is @xmath47 .",
    "up to a quarter of the total @xmath46 decay rate is to @xmath48 .",
    "so while most @xmath46 s are invisible , a significant fraction will produce @xmath49 .",
    "if the higgs mass is small enough and the @xmath46-@xmath28 mass splitting large enough , the decay @xmath50 opens up , suggesting the possibility of a significant unconventional source of higgs bosons at lep .",
    "however , the amount of available phase space is small , limiting this branching ratio to at most a percent or two , rendering such prospects dim .",
    "charginos and stops decay very differently depending on their relative mass .",
    "here we focus upon @xmath51 and @xmath52 since @xmath53 and @xmath54 are likely to be too massive to be important at lep in the short term .",
    "there are three interesting possibilities :  @xmath55 ,  @xmath56 , and  @xmath57 . in region",
    "the stop decays exclusively to @xmath58 , as no other two - body modes are kinematically allowed . for the chargino ,",
    "both @xmath59 and @xmath60 final states are allowed .",
    "generically we expect both modes to have sizeable branching ratios , although phase space suppression or the size of the stop mixing angle can cause one or the other of the two modes to dominate . in region",
    "the decay @xmath61 accounts for virtually 100% of the rate , while @xmath62 dominates the chargino decays , so that stops mainly end up as a @xmath63 ( @xmath64 invisible ) final state . in some cases , @xmath65 can be significant ( _ i.e. _  a few percent ) , though seldom dominant .",
    "this is because we exclude the small corner of parameter space where @xmath66 , since constraints from lep161 and lep172 suggest that @xmath65 is probably small for @xmath52 .",
    "region  combines features from the first two regions : we have @xmath67 ( as in region ) , but the @xmath52 decays mostly to @xmath59 , ( as in region ) . in the cases where the dominant @xmath52 decay is to @xmath59 , we note that most reported limits on @xmath68 do not apply , both because the @xmath52 decay is non - standard and because the @xmath52 cross section is reduced by @xmath43 exchange for our range of  @xmath15 .",
    "we discuss those signals which are large enough to be detectable at lep with @xmath69  pb@xmath6 per detector at a center of mass energy @xmath70 .",
    "the cross section estimates presented below were obtained using the spythia  monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath71 and @xmath72 production are among the largest cross sections , they are almost entirely invisible , as described above . however , on occasion we have @xmath73 , implying @xmath74 , where we use @xmath75 to stand for a set of invisible particles .",
    "since @xmath75 includes two @xmath28 s and a neutrino , and one of the @xmath28 s must combine with the neutrino to form an on - shell sneutrino , the _ minimum _  missing invariant mass is @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , on occasion @xmath71 will give rise to @xmath77 , with a missing invariant mass of at least @xmath78 .",
    "the production of @xmath79 followed by the dominant @xmath27 and @xmath26 decays also leads to a single photon plus missing energy : in fact , this mode accounts for the majority of the @xmath80 total rate .",
    "photons can also be radiated from the initial electrons ( or from the @xmath81-channel chargino in @xmath72 production , although this contribution is small ) ; the threshold recoil mass here for @xmath72 is about 150 gev , and for @xmath71 about 120 gev .",
    "other channels that can give a photon include @xmath82 with a radiated @xmath44 , @xmath83 , etc . , but these give a smaller contribution@xcite",
    ". the entire effect can be large , giving an excess over the  single photon rate for large missing invariant mass as one signature for supersymmetry .",
    "in the models we are considering , the total susy - related @xmath80 rate is typically between 100 and 300 fb .",
    "once the signal is detected , it constrains the @xmath28 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 , and @xmath43 masses .",
    "of course , there is a background for this @xmath80 channel from @xmath84 and direct @xmath85 production via @xmath86-exchange .",
    "most of the background is not in the region of interest here ( missing mass well above @xmath87 ) , but enough is that some study is required to determine the best cuts on the observed photon .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have studied largely invisible susy signatures and how they might appear in the @xmath80 channel .",
    "the susy cases they examine do not overlap ours , but some of the phenomenology is the same .",
    "their comments on  backgrounds are relevant , particularly for @xmath88 events where neither lepton is detected .",
    "another channel that can give a signal is production followed by @xmath89 and @xmath90 provides another ( but much smaller ) source of @xmath91 events . ]",
    "e^+e^- i. [ twophoton ] this channel is particularly interesting because about six events with missing invariant masses greater than 100 gev have been reported@xcite from lep161 and lep172 running , combining all four detectors and both energies .",
    "the events are precisely in the region where we expect a signal in our models ( _ i.e. _  missing invariant mass above 100 gev ) .",
    "it is very important to know the  background well , since the signal may only be a few times larger .",
    "the best estimate of the background is by s. ambrosanio  @xcite , who has done a careful calculation at tree - level using comphep3.0  @xcite . for photons satisfying the requirements @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94",
    ", he finds a cross section of @xmath95 fb , which gives a background of 1.6 events for perfect photon detection efficiency . assuming an average photon efficiency of 0.8 , the final expected background is about 1.3 events .",
    "we have made checks using pythia  @xcite ( which is not ideal for such calculations ) , and find numbers consistent with ambrosanio s , and certainly not noticeably larger . if a signal is found , a precise evaluation of the higher - order corrections to this background would be useful .",
    "as far as we know , this has not yet been carried out .",
    "the signal has a missing invariant mass @xmath96 larger than @xmath78 , and photons that are never very soft ( because we require @xmath97 ) .",
    "the energy range for the photons produced in  ( [ twophoton ] ) is e_min , max = ( ^2 - ^2 ) ( 1 ) [ eminmax ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the neutralino masses and @xmath100 is the beam energy . although initial state radiation and detector resolution effects will result in some photons having less energy than this minimum , the majority of the signal events in our models will have @xmath101 .",
    "in contrast , the background ( from @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) has a missing invariant mass distribution which is concentrated around the @xmath104 peak ; those background events which do have large @xmath96 tend to contain low - energy photons .",
    "thus , the analysis should impose a minimum energy requirement of about 8 gev for each photon , and define three regions for @xmath96 , say @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the signal we predict is entirely in the region @xmath107 , while little background is in this region ( see above ) . of course",
    ", if softer photons or events from the @xmath104 peak are included in the signal region it will be harder to detect a signal .",
    "even with our tightly constrained parameter space there is a large variation in @xmath108 , but the majority of the parameter space gives cross sections at lep184 from 50400 fb .",
    "( if we consider only those models which imply 310 events of @xmath91 at lep161+lep172 , then this range narrows to 100220 fb . ) note that this channel is independent of the single photon channel as a susy signal .",
    "once the signal is detected , it constrains the @xmath28 and @xmath27 masses .",
    "if the value of @xmath35 is only somewhat larger than 50% , the process @xmath109 can become important .",
    "production also provides a source of @xmath49 events ( with differing kinematics ) . however , at lep184 the cross section times branching ratio for this mode is at most about 10 fb . ]",
    "the signal in this case is large missing energy ( @xmath110 ) and two leptons with a pair mass many widths below the @xmath104 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "our parameter space contains models with up to 200 fb in this channel .    the other channels at lep184 which could have sizeable cross sections are @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( see fig .  [ lepfig ] ) .",
    "for charginos , we just combine the single chargino results above . in region",
    ", chargino decays to @xmath60 and @xmath59 can be comparable , so there are three different signatures : @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , @xmath116 ( @xmath110 ) , and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) . here and below @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    "are any charged leptons , but @xmath120 can be different from @xmath119 . in regions  and ,",
    "the decay @xmath62 dominates , so chargino pairs primarily give @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) . because we have @xmath121 , the decay @xmath122 never dominates .",
    "however , it can lead to @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) as an additional signature , but at a much reduced rate . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) will be important as the chargino pair signature , with all combinations of @xmath125 and @xmath126 possible . since @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129",
    "are not guaranteed to be exactly degenerate , the relative number of each type of lepton pairs can not be precisely predicted .",
    "once such events are seen , they will provide information about the sneutrino mass splittings .",
    "for stops we proceed similarly . in regions  and",
    "stop pairs produce @xmath130 ( @xmath110 ) . in region  stop pairs give the signature @xmath131 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath10 and @xmath132 can be very soft .",
    "the observation of @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) could signal either charginos or stops .",
    "the presence of a soft @xmath133 pair , which might simply appear as a large hadron multiplicity , would tell us that @xmath134 .",
    "the biggest potential background to the @xmath114 channel is @xmath135 .",
    "however , leptons coming from @xmath86-pair production are fairly stiff ( @xmath136 at @xmath70 ) .",
    "events containing two leptonic tau decays produce leptons which are much softer .",
    "however , this mode is suppressed by the branching ratio factor @xmath137 ^ 2 = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ ] . ] on the other hand , the @xmath52-@xmath43 mass difference in our models tends to be smaller than 10 gev , and is frequently only a few gev .",
    "consequently , the maximum lepton energy coming from @xmath52 decay in @xmath112 events at lep184 is only a few gev .",
    "thus , a good event selection strategy would veto energetic leptons , but retain leptons which are as soft as possible .",
    "finally , in some of our models , left - handed slepton pairs are ( barely ) light enough to be produced at lep184 , giving @xmath138 .",
    "unfortunately , the cross section is phase - space limited , and amounts to only 23 fb per slepton flavor .",
    "in the scenario described in this paper , many light superpartners are produced at fermilab .",
    "however , the combination of the near invisibility of @xmath26 , @xmath46 , and @xmath43 with the backgrounds at the tevatron makes for few good signals .",
    "the sparticles which give potentially visible decays are the charginos ( especially @xmath54 ) , @xmath27 , and the lighter stop ( and , possibly , the gluino and heavier squarks : see the end of this section ) . at this point",
    ", some model dependence enters the discussion , as the relative masses of the @xmath54 and @xmath51 are important in determining their decay modes .",
    "however , two signals which are likely to be important are the inclusive @xmath139 and @xmath140 rates .",
    "the first of these two signals is of interest in a wider category of models than considered here  @xcite , while the second is special in that it has no significant parton - level  background .",
    "we begin our discussion with @xmath139 .",
    "both the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) and d - zero ( d0 ) collaborations have reported results on searches for such a signal  @xcite . the cdf results are still preliminary , and do not yet include an upper limit on the @xmath139 rate .",
    "d0 , however , reports the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit @xmath141 fb for photons satisfying the following cuts : transverse energy @xmath142 , pseudorapidity @xmath143 and missing transverse energy @xmath144 within the group of models we are studying here , we obtain this signal from @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 production .",
    "since the production cross section for @xmath54 pairs at the tevatron is large ( @xmath150700 fb in our models ) , it potentially provides the largest contribution to the signal .",
    "first , let us assume that the stop is heavy ( @xmath151 ) . then ,",
    "@xmath152 , and , including the remaining branching ratios , we obtain a contribution of around 100 fb . however , when we account for the effects of the cuts employed by d0 , we find that the total @xmath139 rate is never more than 60 fb , even when the other initial states are added .",
    "thus , our models are consistent with current fermilab search limits .",
    "the expected number of @xmath139 events actually decreases if the stop mass is lowered .",
    "first , a smaller stop mass implies a smaller @xmath153 branching ratio@xcite .",
    "second , if @xmath154 , then the decay @xmath155 opens up , allowing for a @xmath140 final state when the two charginos decay differently .",
    "this possibility is especially interesting since there is no significant parton - level source of such events within the standard model .",
    "depending upon the value of @xmath156 , we estimate that the size of the @xmath140 signal from @xmath145 could be up to 100 fb .",
    "if @xmath24 is even somewhat lighter still , the decay @xmath157 becomes allowed . in this case ,",
    "@xmath158 production followed by @xmath159 and @xmath160 provides an additional source of @xmath140 events .",
    "although @xmath161 tends to be only a few percent at most , the @xmath162 production cross section is enormous ( @xmath163 pb ) .",
    "thus , even a modest 1% value for this branching ratio can lead to an additional 100 fb of @xmath140 production . in connection with this possibility",
    ", we note that if @xmath157 is allowed , then it is likely ( but not certain ) that @xmath164 , in which case the signal becomes @xmath165 .",
    "additional consequences for the tevatron which arise in models which allow top - to - stop decays are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that if charginos and sleptons are in the mass ranges of table  [ decays ] , then in many models gluinos and squarks of the first two families fall in the mass range 200300 gev .",
    "these have large cross sections at fermilab and might also be observable@xcite , possibly even in the present data sample .",
    "the signatures of some such events could cause them to be included in the top quark sample .",
    "this paper reports the predictions for lep of a particular , interesting , region of the susy parameter space .",
    "it is worth reporting these predictions because they are quite different from those of most susy analyses .",
    "for example , the largest cross sections ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) are almost completely invisible ; they only show up occasionally as a single photon plus large missing energy .",
    "the cleanest susy signature may be @xmath166 plus large missing energy , from @xmath167 .",
    "chargino pairs mainly give @xmath168 plus large missing energy , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 can be different leptons and are soft .",
    "stop pairs and selectron pairs are also possible .",
    "if no signals are observed at lep184 , this susy scenario is almost , but not quite , eliminated .",
    "events from lep161 and lep172 running as @xmath147 production would become untenable in the absence of a signal at lep184 .",
    "] at lep194 , this scenario is completely excluded if no signatures are seen with @xmath69 pb@xmath6 per detector . note that most , but not all , sets of masses consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ inputs ] ) and  ( [ massh ] ) are also consistent with all present data .",
    "this is because if  ( [ inputs ] ) and  ( [ massh ] ) do indeed describe the real world , then the sparticles are on the verge of being detected .",
    "if such signals are seen , it will be easy ( and fun ) to extract from even limited data the remaining parameters of the chargino , neutralino and left - handed slepton sectors , @xmath5 , and ( if present ) light stop to good accuracy , even in the most general framework of a softly broken supersymmetric theory .",
    "if a model such as those examined here was indeed observed , the implications for the structure of the fundamental theory will be unusually interesting , since some features are likely to be different from those in most minimal susy models . for example , @xmath169 seems to be nearer to unity than to @xmath170 , and @xmath171 ( which could happen , for example , from the @xmath172-terms coming from an extra @xmath18  @xcite ) .",
