    "the distant , compact , narrow - line radio galaxy 53w002 , at @xmath2 , has been the subject of some interest recently because it may be a relatively young galaxy undergoing a major episode of star formation ( windhorst et al 1991 ) , and because it appears to be the dominant galaxy in a field of 17 faint ly@xmath1 emission line objects , of which 7 have been confirmed to be at a redshift close to that of 53w002 .",
    "this is the most distant such cluster known ( windhorst et al 1991 , pascarelle et al 1996a , 1996b ) , and one motivation for its further study is to test the formation of giant galaxies through the assemblage of sub - galactic star - forming clumps ( windhorst et al 1998 , pascarelle et al 1998 ) . in this respect ,",
    "analysis of the molecular content and distribution in the dominant galaxy of this cluster , 53w002 , might bring some new input into the discussion .    to this end , yamada et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported a tentative detection of co(10 ) emission from 53w002 using the nobeyama 45 m telescope , which was followed by an interferometric measurement of co(32 ) by scoville et al .",
    "( 1997a ; hereafter s97a ) using the owens valley millimeter array . of particular interest in the latter study was that the co source appeared to be extended by @xmath3 kpc , although the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement was not very high . in other",
    "known luminous co sources , such as arp 220 and the cloverleaf quasar ( h1413 + 117 ) , the molecular gas appears to be concentrated in the inner few hundred parsecs of the galactic nucleus rather than being distributed on kpc scales ( scoville et al .",
    "1997b ; kneib et al .",
    "1998 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) . as of this writing",
    "there are 9 well - documented detections of co at high redshift ( recently summarized by combes et al .",
    "1999 ) , including 53w002 , which is one of only two in this list that appears not to be gravitationally lensed .",
    "the presence of abundant molecular gas can be an indicator of widespread star formation or nuclear starbursts , and can also be a signpost for the fueling of an active nucleus following a merger or interaction between galaxies . since 53w002 has both an active nucleus and apparent extended star formation , as revealed by its extension in the ly@xmath1 emission line , and",
    "therefore may be under construction via mergers , observations of molecular lines are clearly germane to understanding the system . given the relevance , and potential uncertainties , of the previous co measurements , we undertook new observations of 53w002 in the co(32 ) line at 3 mm and in the continuuum at 3 mm and 1.3 mm , using the iram plateau de bure interferometer , which we report here .",
    "the observations were performed with the plateau de bure interferometer of the institut de radio astronomie millimetrique over a number of sessions from september 1996 to november 1997 .",
    "we searched for the co(32 ) line emission using two central frequency setups , 101.945 and 102.195 ghz , for a total of 55 hours . during part of this time (  20 hours ) data at 1.3 mm were recorded simultaneously to probe the object s continuum at this frequency .",
    "the total frequency bandwidth was 512 mhz , 50 channels , and typical system temperatures were 130 k at 3 mm and 500 k at 1.3 mm .",
    "a number of sources were used to track variations in the phase and gain .",
    "the source 1739 + 522 was used for flux calibration which could be achieved within an accuracy of 5% .",
    "the various configurations of the interferometer array , including 4 or 5 15 m antennas , covered baselines from short ( 24 m ) to long ( 408 m ) . combining the whole data set results in a final synthesized beamsize of @xmath4 ( natural weighting ) at pa=90@xmath5 , and covers a field - of - view of @xmath6 . for the results presented hereafter ,",
    "the velocity origin is at frequency 101.8845 ghz . because of the two different central frequency settings , the ( u - v ) plane coverage is not identical at all frequencies across the co(32 ) line - profile , which results into a slightly changing spatial resolution across the line - profile : for channels centered at -823 , -588 and -353 , the spatial resolution is better than for channels centered at -117 , + 117 and + 353 .",
    "co(32 ) emission was detected with an integrated flux of @xmath7 jy .",
    "the line profile is shown in figure 1 ( velocity resolution 118 ) , channel maps in figure 2 ( velocity resolution 235 ) , and the velocity - integrated co map in figure 3 ( 700  window ) .",
    "the maps in figure 2 have an rms uncertainty of 0.45 mjy beam@xmath8 , and for figure 3 the map rms is 0.25 mjy beam@xmath8 .",
    "the best fit position for the integrated co source is ra(b1950 ) = @xmath9 and dec(b1950 ) = @xmath10 , with an uncertainty of @xmath11 in each coordinate .",
    "this uncertainty is from two components added in quadrature , one due to phase and baseline errors amounting to @xmath12 , and a second from the map noise of @xmath13 .",
    "for the 235   channel maps of figure 2 , the positional uncertainty in the channels at @xmath14  and @xmath15  is @xmath16 , and that of the channel at @xmath17  is @xmath18 .    we find no significant co emission from any of the ly@xmath1 galaxies in the field surrounding 53w002 .    at 3 mm ( 101 ghz ) the measured continuum flux density ,",
    "using line - free channels , is @xmath19 mjy , yielding a @xmath20 upper limit of @xmath21 mjy . at 1.3 mm ( 230 ghz ) , using both sidebands ,",
    "the measured flux density is @xmath22 mjy . in collaboration with r.  antonucci and t.  hurt",
    ", we also obtained a 1.3 mm measurement using the iram 30 m telescope 19-channel bolometer of @xmath23 mjy ( february 1997 ) . combining this with the pdbi result",
    ", the weighted average is @xmath24 mjy .",
    "any contribution from the centimeter wavelength synchrotron spectrum should be negligible at millimeter wavelengths ( see figure 4 of s97a ) .",
    "measured co and continuum parameters and derived luminosities are summarized in table 1 .",
    "first we compare our results with those of s97a .",
    "the integrated co fluxes are in good agreement between the two experiments : @xmath7 jy   found here versus @xmath25 jy  found by s97a . yet",
    ", the error quoted by s97a seems to be underestimated for the following reason : the rms given in their figure 3 is 0.44 mjy beam@xmath8 , while the co line flux is integrated over a @xmath26 aperture which comprises two independent beams .",
    "hence the error bar on the line flux should read @xmath27 jy  ( @xmath28 ) rather than @xmath29 jy  as quoted , yielding a @xmath30 detection only . the derived line redshifts between this experiment and s97a are consistent within the errors .",
    "s97a noted a positional shift with velocity in their channel maps , leading to the conclusion that the source was extended and possibly rotating . from the velocity - integrated co map they derived a deconvolved co(32 ) source size of @xmath31 ( fwhm for an elliptical gaussian ) , or about @xmath32 kpc ( @xmath33kpc@xmath34 ) , at position angle @xmath35 . we can neither confirm nor exclude a source of these dimensions , based on our integrated co map alone .",
    "the source can equally well be unresolved , @xmath36 in diameter , or @xmath31 at any position angle .",
    "s97a note that `` in view of the limited signal - to - noise ratio in the maps , these size estimates are highly uncertain ; however , it is clear that the emission is resolved , since the centroid is shifted in the channel maps . ''",
    "this shift in the centroid is the crucial evidence for extension , but our maps do not show it . for direct comparison",
    "we plot the same channel maps in our figure 2 as those of s97a ( also their figure 2 ) : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38   ( plus we include maps at @xmath39  and @xmath40 ) . between the @xmath15and @xmath37  maps of s97a",
    "there is a position shift of the peak emission of roughly @xmath26 , whereas in our channel maps ( the three with significant emission ) there is no shift in the spatial peaks or centroids to within our relative astrometric accuracy of @xmath41 .",
    "note that emission is also seen at @xmath14 in our data , but not in the maps of s97a .",
    "the lower contours of our integrated co map ( figure 3 ) are distorted somewhat toward the southwest , but this distortion is not significant within the map noise uncertainties .",
    "we conclude from our data that a velocity gradient with position such as that seen by s97a is not supported , thereby casting serious doubt on the reality of any extension to the co emission in 53w002 , at least on the scale of a few arcseconds .",
    "the evidence from the plateau de bure is consistent with a point source spatially coincident at all velocities .    with regard to the yamada et al .",
    "( 1995 ) co(10 ) observation , s97a noted that the co(10 ) flux is far too strong to be a counterpart of the observed co(32 ) , given the normal range of co excitation seen in galaxies .",
    "the same conclusion applies to our own measurement , which is even somewhat weaker .",
    "the co(10 ) as measured by yamada et al .  is an order of magnitude or more too strong to be consistent with the co(32 ) emission .",
    "the mass of molecular hydrogen in 53w002 , as derived from the co luminosity , depends on one s choice of the @xmath42 conversion factor , @xmath1 .",
    "the standard value for galactic molecular clouds based on co(10 ) data , @xmath43 ( k  pc@xmath44)@xmath8 , is almost certainly too high for dense starbursts and active galactic nuclei .",
    "downes & solomon ( 1998 ) find a value 5 times lower in a study of extreme starbursts in ultraluminous infrared galaxies , and barvainis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derive a value 10 times lower in a multi - line study of the cloverleaf quasar . for @xmath45",
    "k  pc@xmath46 and using the downes & solomon conversion factor , the molecular hydrogen mass would be roughly @xmath47 , while using the barvainis et al .",
    "factor it would be around @xmath48 . the co luminosities of 53w002 and the cloverleaf are quite comparable , once account is taken for lensing in the latter .",
    "if the co magnification factor is 10 for the cloverleaf , then its intrinsic co luminosity is @xmath49 kpc@xmath46 ( barvainis et al .",
    "1997 ) , compared with @xmath50 k  pc@xmath46 for 53w002 ( table 1 ) .",
    "in table 2 we provide a compilation of available astrometric measures of 53w002 at 8.4 ghz ( windhorst et al .",
    "1991 ) , 15 ghz ( s97a ) , optical continuum ( windhorst et al .",
    "1991 ) , and co line emission ( s97a and current results ) .",
    "the positions summarized in table 2 show that the location of the co source , which is identical in the three velocity channel maps of the iram data set , is consistent with that derived from the _ integrated _ map in s97a .",
    "the co source location also coincides , within the error - bars , with the vla 8.4 ghz source position ( windhorst et al .",
    "1991 ) , while in right ascension it is more than @xmath51 off the position reported for the vla 15 ghz source ( s97a ) .",
    "this offset is well beyond the quoted error - bars for the 8.4 and 15 ghz vla source positions . for the current discussion",
    "we shall retain the 8.4 ghz positional measure which appears to be more precise .",
    "a similar offset around @xmath52 in right ascension is also found between the co source location and the optical ( rest ultraviolet ) continuum source ( windhorst et al.1991 ) .",
    "this offset however may simply reflect the slight mismatch known to exist between radio and optical reference frames and is not considered to be as significant . indeed ,",
    "recently windhorst et al.(1998 ) have noted for 3 other agns in the field around 53w002 a mismatch of the same order of magnitude between their radio ( vla 8.4 ghz ) and optical positions : this reconciles the 8.4 ghz and optical continuum positions for 53w002 , but , in our view does not explain the disagreement between the vla 8.4 ghz and 15 ghz source locations .    from this astrometric analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the co and 8.4 ghz sources are coincident and consistent with the optical continuum source location , according to the above mentioned shift between radio and optical reference frames .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the co source is related to the agn located at the heart of 53w002 ( windhorst et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "as 53w002 has been considered a key object for testing scenarios of galaxy formation , it is important to establish its properties solidly .",
    "an important question for interpreting the _ evolutionary stage _ of 53w002 is to determine whether the co line emission is mostly related to the agn and surrounding activity or to intense star formation across the body of the galaxy .",
    "given the fact that the higher signal - to - noise ratio iram data set in co does not support the existence of a velocity gradient across the co line emitting region , hence an extension , the validity of associating part of the co line emission with infalling sub - galactic clumps still in the body of a forming galaxy ( windhorst et al .",
    "1998 ) should be questioned .    on the other hand , taking into account the compact configuration of molecular gas systems seen in most ultraluminous infrared galaxies and agns , an association of the co line emission with the various components identified by windhorst et al .",
    "( 1998 ) within the central @xmath53 hst image seems more plausible .",
    "these include the agn per - se ( unresolved source with size @xmath54 ) , a compact core with @xmath55 , a more extended envelope with @xmath56 and two `` blue clouds '' roughly colinear across the nucleus , along pa@xmath57 , at distance @xmath58 w and @xmath59 e , which are well contained within the 8.4 ghz radio source .",
    "the latter also shows an elongation along pa@xmath60 on a scale of @xmath61 .",
    "obviously none of the components identified in the hst data can be spatially disentangled relative to the co line contribution . as noted above however , the co luminosities of 53w002 and the cloverleaf quasar are comparable . in the cloverleaf",
    "the molecular gas was found to reside in the inner 150 pc region by kneib et al.(1998 ) , who argued that this is the signature of the molecular / dusty torus surrounding the active nucleus . in their early imaging and spectroscopic analysis , windhorst et al .",
    "( 1991 ) concluded that the agn in 53w002 exhibits a continuum luminosity close to the boundary with qsos . by analogy with the cloverleaf ( and ultraluminous infrared galaxies in general ) it can be argued that the co line emission detected in 53w002 comes mostly from the molecular / dusty torus of the agn itself .",
    "interferometric data at higher resolution are required to resolve this point .",
    "hughes & dunlop ( 1998 ) reported a @xmath62 upper limit of 3.3 mjy for 53w002 in the continuum at 800 . combining this upper limit ( corrected to 800  assuming a submillimeter spectral index of 3.5 ) and the value @xmath63 jy  from table 1",
    ", we find that @xmath64 . for four other high-@xmath65 sources with both co(32 ) and 800  continuum detections , this ratio ranges from 88to 165 .",
    "therefore , in terms of co to dust ratio , the case of 53w002 looks somewhat peculiar .",
    "our measurement of @xmath66 mjy at 1.3 mm is well above the extrapolation of the centimeter wavelength spectrum ( s97a ) , suggesting the presence of an extra component . because upper limits only are available for the continuum at 3 mm and 850 , the nature of this extra component",
    "can not be constrained further .",
    "if it is dust at about 50k , the upper limit to the mass of dust inferred from the measure at 850  is @xmath67 for the cosmological parameters chosen in this paper ( hughes and dunlop 1998 ) .",
    "this new set of observations of co(32 ) line emission in the radio galaxy 53w002 , collected with the iram plateau de bure interferometer , is of an improved ( 8 sigma ) signal - to - noise ratio relative to previous studies .",
    "the individual channel maps ( averaged over 235 ) do not show any positional velocity shift and hence do not support an extension of the co line emitting region beyond @xmath68 ( fwhm ) . within the quoted uncertainties , the co(32 ) source",
    "is found to be positionally coincident with the vla 8.4 ghz source , as well as with the hst optical continuum ( rest ultraviolet ) image of 53w002 .",
    "we conclude that a large fraction of the co line emission is likely related to the agn itself or its immediate surroundings .",
    "the co line profile has a fwhm = @xmath69 , while the total co line flux is found to be @xmath70 jy . assuming a figure @xmath71 ( k  pc@xmath44)@xmath8 for the conversion factor from @xmath72 to m(h@xmath73 ) , which better applies to dense regions around the centers of galaxies , we derive a molecular mass in the range @xmath74 .",
    "this value is comparable to the one found within the 150 pc region in the cloverleaf quasar .",
    "therefore , the co line emission observed in 53w002 could be entirely related to the agn of this galaxy .",
    "new measurements of the millimeter continuum of 53w002 at 1.3 mm , as well as upper limits for the continuum at 3 mm and 850 , imply the presence of an extra component in addition to the synchrotron source responsible for the centimeter spectrum .",
    "if interpreted in terms of dust , then the implied gas to dust ratio in 53w002 is larger than @xmath75 .",
