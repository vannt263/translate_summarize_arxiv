    "protein folding kinetics is usually modeled in either of three ways . first , there are mass - action models that capture the amplitudes and decay rates of the exponentials in the folding or unfolding relaxation process @xcite .",
    "mass - action models are useful for cataloging the different types of kinetic behavior , but give no insight into molecular structures or mechanisms",
    ". such models do not predict other experimental properties , such as @xmath0-values .",
    "second , there are all - atom or lattice model simulations that can explore sequence - structure relationships ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are usually limited by computational power to short time scales and to studying restricted conformational ensembles .",
    "third , between these macroscopic and microscopic extremes , another type of model has recently emerged .",
    "this class of models uses knowledge of the native structure to infer the sequences of folding events @xcite .",
    "some of these models define partially folded states with one or two contiguous sequences of native - like ordered residues @xcite .",
    "others are based on a go - model energy function that enforces the global stability of the native state @xcite .",
    "we describe here a folding model of the third type .",
    "our model uses knowledge of the native structure to predict the kinetics .",
    "however , it differs from previous models in several respects .",
    "first , our model focuses on chain entropies and estimates loop lengths from the graph - theoretical concept of effective contact order eco ( see below ) .",
    "we follow time sequences of loop - closure events because we expect that these events reveal how the kinetics is encoded in the native structure .",
    "we assume that folding proceeds mostly through closures of small loops , and that large - loop closures are much slower and less important processes .",
    "second , our model focuses on _ contacts _ within the chain , not on whether _ residues _ are native - like or not @xcite , because we think the formation of contacts is a more physical description of the folding process .",
    "therefore , in our model partially folded states are characterized by formed contacts , not by contiguous stretches of native - like ordered residues as in other simple models .",
    "third , the folding kinetics is described by a master equation that can be solved directly for the macrostates considered here , without stochastic simulations such as molecular dynamics or monte carlo .",
    "hence the present treatment can handle the full spectrum of temporal events .",
    "the present work is related to a recent model of protein zipping @xcite .",
    "our fundamental units of protein structure are _",
    "contact clusters_. a contact cluster is a collection of contacts that is localized on a contact map , corresponding roughly to the main structural elements of the native structure .",
    "examples of contact clusters are turns , @xmath1-helices , @xmath2-strand pairings , and tertiary pairings of helices .",
    "a central quantity in our models is the effective contact order ( eco)@xcite . the eco is the length of the loop that has to be closed in order to form a contact , given a set of previously formed contacts or contact clusters .",
    "the premise is that the formation of the _ nonlocal _ contact clusters requires the prior formation of other , more _ local _ , clusters .",
    "our model predicts average @xmath0-values for secondary structural elements that are in good agreement with the experimentally observed values for several two - state proteins .",
    "it shows that @xmath0-value distributions can be understood from loop - closure events that are defined by the native topology of a protein .",
    "the importance of topology for routes and @xmath0-values has also been previously noted by other groups @xcite . to compute the dynamics",
    ", we use a master equation .",
    "several previous studies of the folding kinetics of lattice heteropolymer models have also been based on master equation methods @xcite .",
    "these methods have the advantage that they require no _ ad hoc _ assumptions about what the transition state is .",
    "the transition state emerges in a direct physical way from the solution to the master equation .",
    "however , the lattice models are too simplified to treat specific amino acid sequences or specific protein structures .",
    "lattice models focus on transitions between _ microstates _ , the individual chain conformations , since these are the fundamental units of structure in such models .",
    "our present master equation describes transitions between _ macrostates _ , defined by the contact clusters of a given protein structure . in this way",
    ", the present model aims to make closer contact with experiments .",
    "to compute the folding kinetics , we start with the native contact map , the matrix in which element @xmath3 equals 1 if the residues @xmath4 and @xmath5 are in contact , and equals 0 otherwise .",
    "two residues are defined as being in contact if the distance between their @xmath6 or @xmath7 atoms is less than 6 angstroms .",
    "next , we divide the native contact map into contact clusters .",
    "each contact cluster corresponds to a structural element of the protein .",
    "two contacts @xmath3 and @xmath8 are defined as being in the same cluster if they are close together on the contact map , according to the distance criterion that @xmath9 .",
    "we define two types of clusters : local and nonlocal .",
    "clusters are _ local _ if they contain at least one local contact @xmath3 having contact order @xmath10 .",
    "local clusters include helices , turns , or @xmath2-hairpins , for example .",
    "a cluster is _ nonlocal _ if it has no local contacts ; examples include @xmath2-strand pairings other than hairpins , and the tertiary interactions of helices . to qualify as nonlocal ,",
    "a cluster must also have more than two contacts ; isolated nonlocal contacts are not considered to be clusters .",
    "similarly , we do not consider as contributing to clusters any ` peripheral ' contacts @xmath3 with a minimum distance @xmath11 to the other contacts in the cluster .",
    "in general , typical contact maps have only a few isolated nonlocal or peripheral contacts .",
    "[ clusters ] shows examples of clusters , specifically for chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 ( ci2 ) and the src sh3 domain . by our criteria , ci2 has 5 local clusters and 2 nonlocal clusters ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , and the src sh3 domain has 6 local clusters and 2 nonlocal clusters ( rt-@xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "we assume that each cluster is either formed or not ; we neglect partial degrees of formation .",
    "thus , for a protein with @xmath16 clusters , there are @xmath17 possible states that describe the progression to the native state .",
    "each of these macrostates is characterized by a vector @xmath18 , where @xmath19 indicates that cluster @xmath4 is formed and @xmath20 indicates that cluster @xmath4 is not formed . in our model ,",
    "the free energy of the protein as a function of the state @xmath21 of cluster formation is given by : @xmath22 \\label{statefs}\\ ] ] each cluster @xmath4 that is formed ( @xmath23 ) contributes to the free energy @xmath24 of the state @xmath21 with two terms : a state - dependent free energy of loop closure @xmath25 ( ` initiation ' free energy ) , and a free energy @xmath26 for forming the cluster contacts ( ` propagation ' free energy ) .",
    "here , @xmath27 is a loop - closure parameter .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is the _ initiation eco _",
    "@xcite for cluster @xmath4 .",
    "the initiation eco of a cluster is the length of the smallest loop that must be closed in order to form that cluster from the other existing clusters . for a local cluster ,",
    "the initiation eco is the smallest co among the contacts . for a nonlocal cluster ,",
    "the initiation eco depends on the presence of other clusters in the state @xmath21 . in general",
    ", the initiation eco also depends on the sequence through which those clusters are formed .",
    "however , in order to apply the master equation formalism , we need a free energy and thus we require a definition of initiation eco that is only a function of state . for this purpose , we use the following scheme . if only one nonlocal cluster is formed in a certain state , the initiation eco of that cluster is the smallest eco among the cluster contacts , given all the local clusters formed in that state . if multiple nonlocal clusters are present in a state , we consider all the possible sequences along which these clusters can form , and determine the one having the smallest sum of ecos . for instance , for a state with two nonlocal clusters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , there are two sequences : ( 1 ) @xmath29 @xmath31 @xmath30 , and ( 2 ) @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath29 .",
    "the minimum ecos for the clusters are determined sequentially : @xmath32 and @xmath33 along sequence ( 1 ) , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 along sequence ( 2 ) .",
    "if @xmath36 is smaller than @xmath37 , the initiation ecos @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the clusters @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the given state are taken to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the initiation ecos @xmath38 and @xmath39 are an estimate for the smallest loop lengths required to form the two clusters in the state . in eq .",
    "( [ statefs ] ) , the free energy cost of the loops is estimated by a simple linear approximation in the loop length . this is not unreasonable since the range of relevant ecos only spans roughly one order of magnitude , from about @xmath40 to @xmath41 or 40 .",
    "in general , determining the free energy of a chain molecule with multiple constraints or contacts is a complicated and unsolved problem . for the simpler problem of hairpin - like loop closures",
    ", several estimates have been given in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", this model could treat the detailed energetics of each folding route , if each of the @xmath16 clusters were characterized by its own free energy @xmath26 .",
    "but here we consider a simpler version of the model .",
    "we assume that there are only two parameters for the free energy of formation : @xmath42 for propagating any local cluster , and @xmath43 for propagating any nonlocal cluster . to obtain two - state folding and agreement with experimental @xmath0-values",
    ", we find that @xmath44 must be nonnegative and @xmath45 must be negative .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observation that local structures , such as helices or @xmath2-hairpins , are generally unstable in isolation .",
    "similar in spirit , the diffusion - collision model of karplus and weaver assumes that microdomains , e.g.  helices , are individually unstable @xcite .",
    "thus , the rate - limiting barrier to folding in our model turns out to be the formation of mostly local structures needed to reduce the ecos of nonlocal clusters .",
    "the driving force for overcoming this barrier is the favorable free energy @xmath45 of assembling the nonlocal clusters .",
    "the predicted free energy landscape of the src sh3 domain is shown in fig .",
    "[ landscape ] , using the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 , where @xmath48 is boltzmann s constant @xmath49 temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is chosen so that the equilibrium probability that the two nonlocal clusters rt-@xmath14 and @xmath15 are both folded ( ` native state ' ) is 0.9 , which gives @xmath50 @xmath48 for src sh3 . with these parameter settings ,",
    "we obtain a good agreement with average experimental @xmath0-values for the src sh3 domain and other two - state folders ( see below ) . for clarity",
    ", we show in the figure only a reduced set of states based on the 5 major clusters @xmath51 , @xmath12 , @xmath52 , rt-@xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the three small clusters t , dt , and h have negligible effects on the folding kinetics and on the @xmath0-values . only states differing by the formation of a single cluster are kinetically connected .",
    "the uphill steps in this model either are steps in which a local cluster is formed , or steps involving high ecos .",
    "the downhill steps are steps in which a nonlocal cluster is formed with a low eco , or steps in which a local cluster significantly reduces the ecos of previously formed nonlocal clusters .",
    "the model predicts two main folding routes . along the upper route ( e )",
    "@xmath15 folds after ( d ) rt-@xmath14 ; along the lower route , they form in the opposite order . along these routes ,",
    "the barriers ( highest free energies states ) are the states in which two clusters are formed : bd and bc for the upper route , and ac for the lower route .      in this section ,",
    "we describe the folding dynamics .",

    "finally , on the longest time scale , @xmath99 , the pairwise and triplet clusters reach sufficiently high populations to assemble into multi - cluster complexes , proceeding downhill in free energy to the native structure .",
    "what is the basis for the cooperativity of folding in our model , i.e.  for the separation of time scales ?",
    "first , the formation of local structures in our model reduces the loop - closure entropies for the formation of the nonlocal structures .",
    "second , only the nonlocal structures have favorable propagation free energies @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the formation of the nonlocal structures stabilizes the overall fold , and thus also the local structures .",

    "( [ statefs ] ) due to the formation of local structures and loops ( see fig .  [ landscape ] ) .",
    "interestingly , if we set the free energies for local structure formation to be negative by several @xmath48 , we obtain fast multi - exponential downhill folding , without a barrier .",
    "based on experiments and theory , such downhill folding has been recently postulated for the protein bbl @xcite . to understand the cooperative folding in the model , it is instructive to turn off the loop - closure term in eq .",
    "( [ statefs ] ) by setting @xmath101 .",
    "then all @xmath16 clusters are independent of each other . in that case , there is no cooperativity .",

    "each of these eigenvalues has a population that is given by the binomial coefficient @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "this gives a broad non - two - state spectrum .",
    "hence , the separation of time scales  and the two - state cooperativity  arise in this model from the coupling of the clusters via the loop - closure term in eq .",
    "( [ statefs ] ) . to see the magnitude of the barrier , note that the folding rate @xmath89 is related to the height of the energy barrier on the folding landscape . for comparison , consider a mass - action model with three states d @xmath104 t @xmath104 n ( denatured state , ` transition ' state , native state ) and transition rates as in eq .",
    "( [ transrates ] ) .",
    "the folding rate is given , to a very good approximation , by @xmath105 $ ] for barrier energies @xmath106 .",
    "the factor of 1/2 comes from the fact that a molecule in state t can jump both to d and n , with almost equal probability , since both sides of high - barrier transition states are steep downhills .",
    "now , for the energy landscape of the src sh3 domain shown in fig .  [ landscape ] , the minimum barrier has free energy 2.4 @xmath107 for state bd",
    ". the corresponding barrier crossing rate of @xmath108 $ ] is in good agreement with the folding rate @xmath109 ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "experiments have been interpreted either as indicating that burst phases involve structure formation or that burst phases are processes of non - structured polymer collapse , depending on the protein and the experimental method @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the burst phase is a process of structure formation .",
    "non - structured collapse is beyond the scope , or resolution , of our model , because the model has only a single fully unstructured state  the state in which none of the clusters is formed .",
    "the burst phase in our model captures fast preequilibration events within the denatured state in response to initiating the folding conditions at @xmath85 . in the model",
    ", this denatured state is an ensemble of macrostates on one side of the barrier in the energy landscape ( see fig .",
    "[ landscape ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such preequilibration events within the denatured state exist also for real proteins .",
    "however , whether these events can be detected as burst phases in experiments should depend on the initial conditions , experimental probes , etc .",
