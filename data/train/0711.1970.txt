    "_      crucial xest results on x - ray production and accretion can be summarized as follows :    1 .",

    "* kastner  2002 ) , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we can not assess what the relative importance of these processes is .",

    "strong absorption and extinction of protostars and their immediate environment make the launching region of their powerful jets generally inaccessible to optical , near - infrared , or x - ray studies .",
    "however , a class of strongly accreting , optically revealed ctts also exhibit so - called micro - jets visible in optical lines ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hirth  1997 ) ) , with flow speeds similar to protostellar jets .",
    "ctts micro - jets have the unique advantage that they can - in principle - be followed down to the acceleration region both in the optical and in x - rays .",
    "x - ray spectra of very strongly accreting , micro - jet driving ctts exhibit an anomaly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pinkspec ] , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gdel  2005 ) , ( * ? ? ? * gdel  2007b ) ) : the spectra of dg tau , gv tau , dp tau , cw tau , and hn tau are composed of two components , a cool component subject to very low absorption and a hot component subject to photoelectric absorption about one order of magnitude higher . for similar phenomenology , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cool component shows temperatures atypical for t tau stars , ranging from @xmath24  mk , while the hot component reveals extremely high temperatures ( 10100  mk ) .",
    "we discuss in the following the best example , the single ctts dg tau .",
    "the hard spectral component of the dg tau point source is unusually strongly absorbed , with a gas column density ( @xmath25  @xmath26 ) higher by a factor of @xmath27 than predicted from the visual extinction @xmath28 of 1.53  mag if standard gas - to - dust ratios are assumed ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gdel  2007b ) and references therein ) . because the hard component occasionally flares , in one case being preceded by u band emission as in solar and stellar flares ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gdel  2007b ) ) , it is most straightforwardly interpreted as coronal or `` magnetospheric '' .",
    "the _ excess absorption _ is likely to be due to the heavy accretion streams falling down along the magnetic fields and absorbing the x - rays from the underlying corona / magnetosphere .",
    "the excess absorption - to - extinction ( @xmath29 ) ratio then is an indicator of dust sublimation : _ the accreting gas streams are dust - depleted_.    in contrast , @xmath11 of the soft x - ray component , @xmath30  @xmath26 ( 90% error range ) is _ lower _ than suggested from the stellar @xmath28 , @xmath31  @xmath26 .",
    "a likely origin of these x - rays is the base of the jet .",
    "such an origin is suggested by i ) the unusually soft emission not usually seen in t tauri stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gdel  2007a ) ) , ii ) the low @xmath11 , and iii ) the explicit evidence of jets in the _ chandra _ image , as we will show below .      a _ chandra _ x - ray image of the dg tau environment is shown in fig .",

    "also shown is a smoothed version . to suppress background and to emphasize the soft sources , only counts within the 0.61.7  kev range",
    "are plotted .",
    "there is clear evidence for a jet - like extension outside the stellar point spread function ( psf ) to the sw along a position angle of @xmath33  deg , but we also find a significant excess of counts in the ne direction ( pa @xmath34  deg ) .",
    "this is coincident with the jet optical axis , which for the sw jet has been given as 217 - 237  deg ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eislffel & mundt 1998 ) ) .",
    "we verified , using raytrace simulations , that the jet sources are extended : a faint point source would occupy only a few pixels .",
    "we also find the counter jet to be harder , with photon energies mostly above 1  kev , while the forward jet shows a mixture of softer and harder counts .",
    "the spectral properties of the jet sources are reminiscent of the _ soft _ component in the `` stellar '' spectrum .          1 .   a weakly absorbed , diffuse , soft component along the forward - jet axis ; 2 .   an intermediately absorbed , diffuse , soft component along the counter - jet axis ; 3 .   a weakly absorbed , compact , non - variable , soft component ( within the stellar psf ) ; 4 .",
    "a strongly absorbed , compact , flaring , hard component ( within the stellar psf ) .",
    "the low @xmath11 of the _ forward jet _ and of the _ soft stellar _ component suggests that the soft spectral emission originates from a region `` in front '' of the star .",
    "we identify the soft component with x - ray emission from the base of the jets .",
    "in contrast , the harder _ counter jet",
    "_ suggests stronger absorption by the extended gas disk .",
    "a determination of the gas - to - dust ratio is in principle possible by measuring the differential absorption and extinction of the two jets .",
    "finally , the _ hard stellar _ component is attributed to a ( flaring ) corona , with the excess photoelectric absorption due to dust - depleted accretion gas streams .    the combined power of the resolved jets and the unresolved soft spectral component is of order @xmath35  erg  s@xmath6 , similar to the x - ray output of a moderate t tauri star .",
    "this emission , distributed above the accretion disk , may be an important contributor to x - ray heating and ionization of gaseous disk surfaces ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* glassgold  2004 ) ) .",
    "we speculate that protostellar jets in general develop the same kind of jet x - ray emission , but these sources remain undetected close to the star because of strong photoelectric absorption .    this work has been supported by the international space science institute in bern , the swiss national science foundation ( at , ma , mg : grants 20 - 66875.01 , 20 - 109255/1 , pp002110504 ) , asi / inaf ( palermo group , grant asi - inaf i/023/05/0 ) , and nasa ( ma , ss , dp : grants nng05gf92 g , go6 - 7003 ) .",
