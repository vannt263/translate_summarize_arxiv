    "we study the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of the sample of 795 luminous compact galaxies ( lcg ) for the h@xmath0 emission line , far ultraviolet ( fuv ) and near ultraviolet ( nuv ) continua .",
    "recent bursts of star formation with age less than 6 myr are present in all galaxies as evidenced by very high h@xmath8 emission - line equivalent widths .",
    "thus , our sample consists of extreme compact galaxies , populating the high - end tail of the lf of the overall star - forming population .",
    "in this paper we consider five functions to fit the lfs of our sample , namely the schechter function @xcite , the saunders distribution @xcite , the log - normal one and two functions proposed by @xcite .",
    "the schechter function was commonly used to approximate lfs in the h@xmath0 emission line and ultraviolet ( uv ) range .",
    "however , it was argued in some recent papers that observed lfs deviate from the schechter function due to an excess of very luminous galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the h@xmath0 lf for galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) galaxies with @xmath9 is better described by the saunders function , which can be reduced to the log - normal distribution for the considered sample .",
    "the h@xmath0 and uv radiation is produced by the population of massive stars , which were formed during the recent burst .",
    "therefore , galaxy luminosities at these wavelengths attain a maximum shortly after a starburst .",
    "later on , the h@xmath0 and uv luminosities strongly decrease with time after a starburst age @xmath10 myr , when the most massive stars start to fade out .",
    "the temporal dependence of this rapid luminosity evolution was found by @xcite .",
    "it has a form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the starburst age , @xmath13 is the luminosity at @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is approximated by @xmath16 with @xmath17 myr and the exponent @xmath18 , which depends on the wavelength ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same function is appropriate for the luminosities in the 22 @xmath19 m ir band , derived using the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( _ wise _ ) data and probably for the radio emission at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "naturally , the rapid luminosity evolution affects the observed lf .",
    "this effect was studied by @xcite , who derived the functional forms of lfs in the cases when the initial galaxy luminosities @xmath13 are approximated by the schechter or log - normal distributions .",
    "however , we note that the decrease with time of the starburst h@xmath0 luminosity is much steeper than that of the fuv and nuv luminosities .",
    "this is because the h@xmath0 emission is produced only by the most massive short - lived stars while the contribution of the less massive and longer - lived stars to the fuv and nuv emission is important .    in particular , between 0 and 10 myr it decreases by more than two orders of magnitude , while the fuv luminosity is decreased only by a factor of two @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that the fuv - to - h@xmath8 luminosity ratio for galaxies with high ew(h@xmath8 ) is lower than that for galaxies with low ew(h@xmath8 ) .",
    "this is due to the more rapid evolution of the h@xmath8 luminosity .",
    "therefore , h@xmath0 and fuv luminosities first should be reduced to zero age and only after that be compared . our goal is to find functional dependences , which provide the best fitting of the sample lfs and to derive sets of their optimal parameters .",
    "we use the methods of the mathematical statistic described e.g. by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the maximum likelihood method ( mlm ) is used to derive an optimal set of parameters and the pearson s @xmath2-test is applied to estimate the accuracy of fitting .    the properties of the sample are described in section [ s : sample ] .",
    "we justify the choice of the approximations for the luminosity functions in section [ s : lf ] .",
    "luminosity functions in the h@xmath0 emission line and uv continuum are considered in sections [ s : ha ] and [ s : uv ] , respectively .",
    "a brief discussion of possible physical mechanisms influencing the lf shape is presented in section [ s : d ] .",
    "the best lfs approximations are summarised in section [ s : concl ] .",
    "we use the sample of 795 lcgs selected by @xcite from the data release 7 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite .",
    "these data were supplemented by fuv ( @xmath20=  1528 ) and nuv ( @xmath20 =  2271 ) fluxes , extracted by @xcite from the _ galex _ medium and all - sky imaging surveys .",
    "briefly , the sample selection criteria were as follows : high equivalent width ew(h@xmath8 ) @xmath21",

    "we compared the h@xmath0 line luminosities for lcgs with their luminosities in the 22 @xmath19 m ir band , calculated using _ wise _ data .",
    "we find that the h@xmath0-to-22 @xmath19 m band luminosity ratios for our galaxies are approximately constant , indicating that these luminosities are approximately proportional with a linear pearson s correlation coefficient of 90% .",
    "similar proportionality was obtained by @xcite and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "adopting the @xcite reddening law @xcite found that the fuv - to - h@xmath0 and nuv - to - h@xmath0 luminosity ratios are also constant .",
    "however , the exact values of the latter ratios depend on the adopted @xmath40 , while h@xmath0-to-22 @xmath19 m band luminosity ratios are not sensitive to the value of @xmath40 .",
    "the luminosities were corrected for extinction derived individually in each galaxy . according to @xcite only a sample with individual corrections for extinction can show the deviation of lf from the schechter function .",
    "lfs without extinction correction or corrected using averaged statistical relations have a form that is similar to the schechter function by a coincidence .",
    "summarising , the entire sample consists of 795 galaxies with h@xmath0 luminosities @xcite .",
    "the majority of these galaxies were also detected in the fuv and nuv ranges .",
    "additionally we extracted a subsample of 691 galaxies with a single star - forming region by discarding the galaxies with multiple knots of star formation .",
    "this subsample is used to study the rapid luminosity evolution and to compare with theoretical predictions by @xcite , which were made for the galaxies with a single star - forming region .",
    "the luminosity function is a very important statistical characteristic of galaxy populations .",
    "the optical lf can be reproduced by the schechter function , which is also known in the mathematical statistics as the gamma distribution : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the number of galaxies per unit volume in the luminosity interval from @xmath22 to @xmath45 .",
    "parameters @xmath0 and @xmath46 are determined from the shape of this function . the slope in the [ @xmath47 plane is equal to @xmath0 for @xmath48 and is strongly changed at @xmath49 .",
    "we define the probability density of luminosity distribution @xmath50 , called the sample lf , by introducing a probability @xmath51 for the galaxy , randomly selected from a sample , to have the luminosity in the interval from @xmath22 to @xmath45 . if @xmath52 is the number of galaxies in the sample then @xmath53 is the number of galaxies with the luminosity in the interval from @xmath22 to @xmath45 . to find @xmath50",

    "all these luminosities are indicators of star formation @xcite , therefore their extinction - corrected lfs must be similar . since fir and radio lfs are not described by the schechter function , the deviation of the h@xmath0 and uv lfs from this function is also expected . however , this deviation was found only recently .",
    "a reason is that the luminosities in h@xmath0 line and uv ranges must be individually corrected for the dust extinction , unlike the fir or radio luminosities . without this correction the deviation of lf from the schechter one",
    "is masked .",
    "@xcite showed that the schechter function can not reproduce the distributions of sfrs derived from the uv and h@xmath0 fluxes , and therefore their lfs are also not fitted by the schechter function . on the other hand , optical and near - infrared lfs",

    "we discuss here what physical mechanisms make lfs of lcgs to be different from the lf in the optical continuum of the quiescent galaxies , which can be fitted by the schechter function .",
    "our lcg sample consists of the galaxies with the high star - formation activity and starburst ages less than 5 myr .",

    "we do not apply completeness corrections for the lf faint - end because the deviations from the schechter function were found only for the lf bright - end which is not affected by the sample incompleteness .",
    "can the difference be a result of the lf evolution with the redshift because of the relatively large range of lcg redshifts of 0.02  0.6 ?",
    "the problem whether lf evolves with a redshift is still not resolved .",

    "no dependence on the redshift and star - formation rate was found for mass - metallicity or luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "this universality may imply the absence of the lf variations with the redshift for compact star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is clear that the presence in galaxies of young stellar populations with luminous massive stars would result in an excess of galaxy lf as compared to that for quiescent galaxies with older stellar populations .",
    "this effect is stronger in the wavelength ranges , which trace star formation .",
    "furthermore , the differences between these lfs are not only quantitative but also qualitative in nature .",
    "the lf of the schechter type , based on the poisson distribution , is expected if the probability of the star formation in some small region of a galaxy does not depend on the star formation in surrounding regions .",
    "the deviation of the lf from the schechter function indicates that the star - forming processes in the nearby regions correlate .",
    "consequently , an excess of bright galaxies in the lf can be due to the propagating star formation stimulated by the burst .",
    "an excess of lcgs on a bright end of lf is detected for the luminosities @xmath223 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "this is a characteristic luminosity of a strong starburst for lcg with the respective sfr @xmath224 yr@xmath6 .",
    "the respective characteristic mass of the young stellar population of @xmath225 is estimated from the ratio @xmath226 , which was obtained for lcgs by @xcite .",
    "we study the goodness of different functions for approximation of the h@xmath0 and uv luminosity functions ( lfs ) of luminous compact galaxies ( lcgs ) .",
    "some of these functions take into account rapid luminosity evolution due to the presence of short - lived massive stars .",
    "we ruled out the schechter function and the related distribution ( [ e15 ] ) , which badly fit the high - luminosity end .",
    "the saunders function , the log - normal distribution and functions ( [ enn ] ) , ( [ enni ] ) , derived in this paper , reproduce lfs much better .",
    "the choice of a preferable function depends on the wavelength .",
    "the h@xmath0 lf of the entire lcg sample is best fitted by either ( [ enn],[e11 ] ) or ( [ enni ] ) distribution with similar corresponding probabilities ( 37% and 36% ) of deviations being caused by random errors . the saunders function with the 31% probability",
    "is prefered compared to the log - normal distribution with the 27% probability .",
    "the probability for the subsample of lcgs with a single knot of star formation is lower compared to the entire sample .",
    "this implies that lcgs with several knots of star formation and those with a single knot have similar lfs with similar data scatter .",
    "the function ( [ enni ] ) is the best for fitting the fuv lf with corresponding probability of 94% .",
    "however , the very low - luminosity end of the lf is better fitted by the log - normal function ( fig . [ fuv ] ) . this fact does not affect the @xmath2 value , because the @xmath2 test ignores a luminosity distribution inside the bins .",
    "the nuv lf can be best fitted by the log - normal distribution with the lower confidence probability of 50% , which is limited because of higher data scatter ( fig .",
    "[ nuv ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the quality of fitting for two out of three lfs is considerably increased by taking into account the rapid luminosity evolution .",
    "the improvement of the probability is 10% for the h@xmath0 lf and 33% for the fuv lf .",
    "the effect of rapid evolution is less pronounced for the nuv lf . using samples with larger ranges of luminosities",
    "would further improve the identification of the best lf functional form .",
    "the effect of the rapid luminosity evolution is more pronounced for the h@xmath0 line than for the fuv and for the fuv than for the nuv as evidenced by the @xmath80 values .",
    "the optimal value provided by mlm and @xmath2-test for the nuv differs from ones for h@xmath0 and fuv probably due to this fact .",
    "however , the minimum of @xmath2 the maximum of @xmath147 are shallow , therefore errors of @xmath80 are large .",
    "we assume that lfs for stellar populations with different ages are different .",
    "we adopt that the lf for the emission in the optical continuum , produced by older stellar population , is described by the schechter function . on the other hand , lfs of the emission in the uv and ir continua and the h@xmath0 line , produced by young stellar populations ,",
    "is described by the log - normal distribution .",
    "it is clear that the bright end of the lf of the young stellar population must exceed the lf of the older stellar population due to the contribution of short - lived massive stars .",
    "thus , starbursts producing a young stellar population with masses of at least @xmath227 are more frequent than the schechter function predicts .",
    "such high masses may be explained by the propagating star formation , which is resulted in the enhanced luminosity and , consequently , in an excess of lcgs at the bright end of lf in comparison with the case without an induced star formation .",
