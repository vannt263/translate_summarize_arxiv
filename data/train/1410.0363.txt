    "nearly 1800 exoplanets are now known , primarily from the radial velocity and transit methods , and another @xmath3 candidates from transit observations with the _ kepler _ space telescope @xcite still await confirmation .",
    "both techniques are most sensitive to more massive planets and/or planets close to their host star ( @xmath41 au ) .",
    "detection of planets further from their star typically relies on either direct imaging , which only works for the closest and youngest systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) , or gravitational microlensing for systems much further away ( e.g.  @xcite ) . while less prolific ( accounting for @xmath54 per cent of detected planets ) , these techniques are nevertheless the most productive means of identifying planets beyond @xmath01 au .",
    "a number of statistical studies using different techniques have recently derived first robust constraints on the frequency of exoplanets for different ranges of masses and orbital separations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a study combining results from all techniques would further calibrate the planet frequency across a range of masses and separations from their host star ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as all four techniques lose sensitivity near the habitable zone of solar - like stars , accurately determining the number of habitable , earth - like planets in the galaxy requires a combination of different techniques .",
    "such comparisons are not presently straightforward : microlensing typically detects planets at distances of several kiloparsecs from the observer , whereas the radial velocity and transit methods mostly focus on brighter stars within 1  kpc of the sun , and direct imaging is only effective within a few tens of parsecs .",
    "statistical studies are therefore limited by systematic variation of parameters such as host star metallicity and age , and are limited by the small number of planets detected at large radii from their hosts .",
    "_ euclid _ @xcite will comprise a 1.2-m korsch telescope imaged by both optical and near - infrared cameras via a dichroic splitter .",
    "the optical camera ( vis ) will use a single , broad , unfiltered bandpass , spanning roughly the @xmath6 bands , and a mosaic of @xmath7 ccds with 0.1  arcsec pixels .",
    "the near - infrared camera ( nisp ) will have three broadband filters ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 bands ) with a mosaic of @xmath10 hgcdte arrays with 0.3  arcsec pixels , giving a total field of view of @xmath50.54 deg@xmath11 .",
    "_ euclid _ is designed to study dark energy through weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite .",
    "however it is also expected to undertake some additional science programmes .",
    "we have previous proposed the exoplanet _ euclid _ legacy survey ( exels ; @xcite ; hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "exels would use the gravitational microlensing method to perform the first space - based survey of cold exoplanets ( typically @xmath121  au from their hosts , including `` free - floating '' planets ) .",
    "exels proposes sustained high - cadence observations of three adjacent fields ( 1.64  deg@xmath11 ) towards the galactic bulge , with a planned centre at @xmath13 .",
    "these fields will be observed continuously for periods of up to one month , limited by _",
    "euclid s _ solar aspect angle constraint , with a cadence of 20  minutes in the nisp-@xmath1 channel .",
    "euclid _ on - board storage capacity and downlink rate of 850  gb / day should also allow observations in the vis channel with a cadence as short as one hour .",
    "the vis data ( in theory , comprising of stacks of several exposures taken over each hour ) can provide the source  lens relative proper motion for many microlensing events and , as we show , would provide the primary channel for detecting transiting systems . the theoretical maximum ( adopted both in paper  i and here ) of 10 @xmath14 30-day observation blocks is unlikely to be possible within the main 6-year _ euclid _ mission lifetime , but could be completed after the primary cosmology mission if the spacecraft remains in good health .",
    "exels primary science objective is the detection of cool , low - mass exoplanets using microlensing .",
    "as such the observing strategy is determined by and optimised for microlensing rather than for transit observations . the observing strategy is therefore taken to be fixed and accepted as non - optimal for the transit science we discuss in this paper .",
    "the galactic centre is not an ideal region to look for transiting exoplanets due to severe crowding .",
    "nonetheless , it is a viable region : both the ground - based optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) microlensing survey ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the dedicated _ hubble space telescope _",
    "sagittarius window eclipsing extrasolar planet search ( sweeps ) survey @xcite have detected transiting planets here .",
    "@xcite predict that @xmath050000 transiting planets could be found using a survey very similar to that proposed by exels , though without the dedicated , continuous coverage of their proposal , we can not expect quite so many here .",
    "exels will provide a more distant sample of hot , transiting exoplanets than obtained from the current and planned large - scale dedicated transit surveys .",
    "yet we will show that a space - based survey should produce many more transits than those detected by bulge - staring surveys like ogle and sweeps .",
    "the combination should be especially useful for removing environmental biases in comparisons of more distant microlensing samples to the nearby transit samples from _ kepler _ , _ plato _ , the _ transiting exoplanet survey satellite _ ( _ tess _ ) and ground - based transit surveys .",

    "planets will be primarily detected in the vis channel ( section [ resultssect ] ) , making this a requirement of a transit survey .",
    "the number of planets found in the microlensing survey would be slightly increased from the values in paper  i , while colour data from lensing events would constrain properties of many more lower - mass free - floating planets .",

    "the flatness of the mass - radius relation for large planets , brown dwarfs and low - mass stars means that transits of large jupiter - like planets can not be distinguished from those of brown - dwarf or low - mass stellar binaries .",

    "we model our exoplanet host population using a monte - carlo approach , based on version 1106 of the besanon  population synthesis galaxy model @xcite , which incorporates a three - dimensional dust model to compute extinction and reddening @xcite .",
    "the populations included in the model are such that stars are limited to between 0.08  4 m@xmath36 ( b  m type stars ) .",
    "no transiting planets have yet been found around stars outside this range and the proposed target area does not include large or young open clusters or star - forming regions .",
    "evolution is covered from the main sequence to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath38 on the giant branch .",
    "the lack of evolved giants , which can be significantly variable at the wavelengths considered ( e.g.  @xcite ) , is expected to be an unmodelled source of red noise and false positives in our sample .",
    "simulated images were constructed from stars drawn from the besanon  model , with a stellar density equivalent to 29  million stars with @xmath39 , or 108  million stars with @xmath40 , over the 1.64 square degree survey area .",
    "each star is simulated using a numerical point - spread function ( psf ) computed for the appropriate filter and detector . to obtain a conservative estimate ,",
    "psfs were computed near the edge of the detector field of view , and with throughput computed for sub - optimal detector performance to include some of the effects of aging on the ccd . full details of these simulations are given in paper  i.    aperture photometry was performed on these simulated images to extract photometric magnitudes .",
    "this provides a conservative estimate for photometric uncertainty due to blending in crowded fields , where psf - fitting or difference imaging would be more accurate .",
    "apertures of radius 0.8@xmath41 and 0.4@xmath41 were used for the nisp-@xmath1 and vis channels , respectively .",
    "these apertures are optimised to provide the highest signal - to - noise on the stellar flux , by maximising flux within the aperture while minimising blending .",
    "the derived magnitudes were compared to the input ( besanon ) magnitudes , and a blending co - efficient ( @xmath42 ) defined as the fraction of the total light in the aperture arising from the host star .",
    "photometric uncertainties can be categorised into random ( `` white '' ) and time - dependent ( `` pink '' or `` red '' ) components .",
    "white noise will reduce as the square root of the number of exposures per transit , @xmath43 .",
    "other noise sources will also be reduced by repeated observations , but by a factor depending on their repeatability and characteristic frequency ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "many can be removed by high - pass frequency filtering ( ` whitening ' ) of time - series data .",
    "for most time - dependent noise sources , we can assume that the photometric uncertainty limiting our ability to detect transiting objects will decrease as the number of observed transits , @xmath44 .",
    "white and pink noise , reduced appropriately , are here summed in quadrature to give the total photometric uncertainty .",
    "both noise estimates have been chosen to match the assumptions of paper  i.    white noise ( @xmath45 ) is taken simply to be the detector poisson noise ( accounting for stellar blending ) .",
    "a pink noise estimate of @xmath46 = 0.001 has been chosen to cover the time - dependent noise sources .",
    "we consider @xmath46 = 0.0003 and 0.003 mag as limiting cases , though show this has little effect on the number of detections . while the on - sky amplitude of pink noise is not yet known , our worst - case scenario is extremely conservative , as even ground - based facilities have noise levels well below this .",
    "our estimate includes the following , non - exhaustive list .",
    "_ image persistence_. this is likely to be the dominant source of pink noise .",
    "a ghost image contrast ratio of @xmath4710@xmath48 is set by _",
    "requirement wl.2.1 - 23 @xcite .",
    "its effect depends on the repeatability of each pointing .",
    "repeated pointing of ghost images to within the same psf may fatally degrade a small number of lightcurves .",
    "less - accurate pointing will provide occassional ( flaggable ) bad data in many lightcurves .",
    "_ zodiacal light variation_. variations in background zodiacal light can be limited to @xmath491 per cent over @xmath1210 years @xcite .",
    "the error in its removal will be substantially smaller .",
    "_ thermal variation and attitude correction_. the spacecraft ",
    "sun angle is limited to between 1@xmath50 and + 31@xmath50 as measured orthogonal to the optical axis .",
    "variation in this angle may cause detector thermal noise variations over each month - long observing window .",
    "these variations should be reproducible and hence removable ( cf .  the ramp in _ spitzer _ irac photometry , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "_ psf changes_.",
    "the psf stability required of _ euclid _ should mean psf changes contribute negligbly to the total error .",
    "_ non - periodic or quasi - periodic stellar variability_. cooler dwarfs show quasi - periodic variability on timescales of days to weeks due to starspots , and on shorter timescales due to flares .",
    "@xcite suggest that m dwarf variability over month - long timescales is typically @xmath491 milli - magnitude ( mmag ) for @xmath068 per cent of m dwarfs and 110 mmag for a further @xmath025 per cent .",
    "we mostly detect planets around higher - mass stars , so this effect will be largely limited to objects blended with m dwarfs .",
    "in this section , we describe the mathematical model behind our signal - to - noise calculations , and show how the signal - to - noise of the amplitude of the transit , secondary eclipse , orbital modulation , ellipsoidal variation and doppler boosting are calculated .",
    "this is intended as a summary only , as the basic physics can be found in textbook works ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we begin with a simple model , defining the transit as a step function .",
    "this neglects : ( 1 ) the ingress and egress time of the transit , ( 2 ) variation due to limb darkening of the star , and ( 3 ) emission from the secondary , which we detail in sections [ moddistgrazesect ] and [ modplanetsect ] .    the photometric depth ( @xmath33 ) and length of the transit",
    "are given in the usual way ( e.g.  @xcite , his eq .",
    "( 6.1 ) and ( 6.4 ) ) , with the depth corrected by the blending factor , @xmath42 .",
    "white ( @xmath45 ) and pink ( @xmath46 ) noise estimates ( section [ modelredsect ] ) , normalised by the number of transits ( @xmath51 ) and exposures per transit ( @xmath52 ) , are quadrature summed to give the total noise in the folded transit lightcurve ( @xmath53 ) , giving a signal - to - noise of : @xmath54 we assert that a transit is detectable if the systemic flux in transit is @xmath1210@xmath55 lower than the out - of - transit flux in the phase - folded lightcurve , hence if @xmath56 .",
    "this considerably exceeds the minimum value of 6@xmath55 found by @xcite . for comparison , @xcite cite an 84 per cent detection rate for 8@xmath55 transits in synthetic _ kepler _ folded light curves .",
    "we therefore believe this limit is suitably conservative and would allow an accurate timing solution to be found for the orbit .",
    "a multiplicative correction can be applied to this simple model to take into account grazing transits and limb darkening .",
    "it can be shown from basic geometry ( e.g.  @xcite ; his section 6.4.2 ) that this is given by : @xmath57 where @xmath23 is the stellar radius , @xmath58 is the orbital distance from mid - transit and @xmath59 is the transit impact parameter ( both in units of @xmath23 ) , @xmath60 is the fraction of the secondary eclipsing the primary star ( mathematically given by the intersection of two circles ) and @xmath61 is the mean limb - darkening co - efficient for the eclipsed part .",
    "the signal - to - noise of the transit will scale as @xmath62 .",
    "the nature of @xmath63 means it is not a trivial correction to calculate analytically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus incorporate this into our model by numerical integration , and typically find it causes a @xmath491 per cent variation on @xmath64 , thus the exact formulation of the limb - darkening law does not matter significantly .",
    "as we show later , most of our detections will be around solar - type stars , thus we approximate @xmath61 by @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 for vis and @xmath68 for nisp-@xmath1 . these values for",
    "@xmath69 should be accurate to within @xmath70 for the majority of our stars @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath71 is a normalisation constant such that the average of @xmath61 over the stellar surface is unity .",
    "the few percent of transiting secondaries with impact factors between @xmath23 and @xmath72 produce grazing transits of their hosts .",
    "these do not produce characteristic flat - bottommed light curves and are therefore much more likely to be mistaken for false positives ( blended binary stars ) than other transits , adding some additional uncertainty to our detectable planet number .",
    "outside of transit , lightcurves are modulated by the difference in emission and reflection from companions day and night sides ( e.g.  @xcite ; see also , e.g. , @xcite , his section 6.4.7 ) , the effect of which can also be seen at secondary eclipse .",
    "we model the secondary as a grey , diffusively - scattering ( i.e.  partially - reflecting , but otherwise lambertian ) disc with albedo @xmath73 .",
    "the flux from the secondary ( @xmath26 ) at a given point in its orbit will be the sum of reflected starlight and emission from its day and night sides , which we model to have uniform but potentially different temperatures using : @xmath74 where @xmath25 is the flux from the star , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the flux from the secondary s day- and night - side hemispheres , @xmath24 is the orbital radius , @xmath29 is the orbital phase from eclipse , @xmath75 , and where the initial factor of four in eq .",

    "( [ sigmateq ] ) .",
    "we assume that a timing solution is well - determined by the transit measurement , thus we can define secondary eclipses with @xmath79 5 to be detections .    for the out - of - eclipse modulation of the lightcuve , we divide the lightcurve between the end of transit ( defined as @xmath80 ; figure [ schemfig ] ) and eclipse ( @xmath81 ) into two equal portions , corresponding the secondary s gibbous and crescent phases . the flux reflected by",

    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , this effect may be stronger than the solar neighbourhood .",
    "however , we note that it may be difficult to extract this information from variations in the initial planet distribution ( other than @xmath159 )",
    ". some clue may come from its imprint in the average planet mass ( figure [ betaqfig ] ; lower panel ) , though this effect could also be mimicked by planetary evaporation .",
    "correlated noise has very little effect on the number of companions we expect to detect at vis until it exceeds @xmath02000 ppm in a transit . in this regime ,",
    "our noise sources are dominated by the poisson noise of the incoming photons .",
    "the limiting value of red noise in @xmath1-band is less , at @xmath01000 ppm , as blending is higher and correlated noise from blended stars starts to become important .",
    "unfortunately , while they may end up being the most scientifically interesting , additional correlated noise affects the smallest planets around the smallest stars more .",
    "we may expect a decreased number of these if correlated noise can not be sufficiently reduced .",
    "however , the reduction of correlated noise for transit detection is a well - established science , and whitening of data to the level of tens of ppm is easily achievable for satellites such as _ kepler_. provided the correlated noise does not have a strong impact at frequencies comparable to the transit duration , we can expect it to be largely removable .",
    "if all red noise can be removed , the number of transit detections would increase by 13 per cent from the best - estimate model .",
    "the cadence of the vis observations has a significant effect on the number of companions we detect .",
    "we have assumed a vis cadence of once per hour in our models , imposed by the download limit from the spacecraft .",
    "figure [ cadfig ] shows the number of expected objects detected with @xmath205 r@xmath142 for a variety of different cadences . increasing the vis cadence to once per 1095 seconds",
    "would approximately double the number of detectable planets .",
    "conversely , reducing the cadence to once per 12 hours ( as per @xmath8- and @xmath9-band ) means a transit survey becomes unviable .",
    "nevertheless , we may still expect transits of @xmath51 per cent of objects detected in vis to be detectable in the 12-hourly @xmath8 and @xmath9-band exposures too .    the total observing time is also modelled ( figure [ epochsfig ] ) .",
    "this survey assumes that we observe in ten month - long periods , spaced every six months .",
    "the number of detected planets increases close to linearly with observing time with observing times greater than @xmath54 months . below this , only the closest - in planets around the brightest stars will be detected .",
    "we note that a long observing period is key to picking up planets at larger orbital radii , which is important for an accurate comparison between the microlensing and transiting planet populations .",
    "our ability to perform photometry on more - heavily - blended stars from the images can make a crucial difference to the number of companions we can detect .",
    "our default assumptions ( @xmath203 for vis and @xmath204 for @xmath1-band ) are set such that we expect to initially identify both individual stars and their transiting companions in the cleaner , higher - resolution vis images , then use this information to identify those same stars and companions in the @xmath1-band data .",
    "this is vital to the success of detecting companions at @xmath1-band , as only a fairly small fraction of stars will have @xmath203 in the @xmath1-band images ( see next section ) .",
    "a limit of @xmath203 is quite conservative : difference imaging is capable of detecting variability in stars much more blended than this ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , though its ability to achieve the required photometric accuracy to detect transits of heavily - blended stars in _ euclid _ data has not yet explicitly been shown .",
    "the minimum signal - to - noise at which we can detect a transit is also a major determinant of the number of companions we can expect to find .",
    "our initial value of 10@xmath55 is conservative : decreasing this to the 8@xmath55 of @xcite or the 6@xmath55 of @xcite would approximately double the number of detectable companions we may hope to detect ( figure [ snrfig ] ) .",
    "our final detection numbers are therefore mostly limited by the success of the reduction pipeline in detecting lower - signal - to - noise transits around heavily - blended stars .",
    "for the currently - envisaged survey strategy corresponding to our best - estimate model , our limits are set by photon noise in vis , which means high - cadence observations in the vis channel are vital to detecting large numbers of companions . as we have chosen conservative estimates for our model parameters , we can expect the true number of observable transiting companions will be considerably greater than those listed in table [ vartable ] .      figure  [ contourfig ] shows the sensitivity of both the exels transit survey and the microlensing survey discussed in paper  i. while it is clear that the transit survey will not approach the sensitivity of _ kepler _ , its sensitivity extends beyond that of most currently - published ground - based transit surveys .",
    "temporal coverage means sensitivity declines towards the orbital radius of mercury , while photon noise limits our sensitivity for planets below neptune s mass .",
    "importantly , the coverage at super - jupiter masses is almost continuous between the regime where the transit survey and microlensing survey are both sensitive .",
    "we will therefore have near - continuous coverage in orbital radius from the closest exoplanets to those at tens of au from their host star .",
    "figure  [ microdistfig ] shows the comparative distances and effective temperatures of the microlensing and transiting exoplanet hosts . while the microlensed planet hosts are typically around much cooler , smaller stars , the distance distributions of microlensed and transiting planets among late - f- and g - type stars shows roughly equal distributions of stars in the galactic disk ( @xmath496 kpc ) and galactic bulge ( @xmath126 kpc ) , in which the galactic bulge targets dominate both samples due to the location of the bulge main - sequence turn - off .",
    "further discrimination of bulge versus disk targets may come from source proper motions and apparent brightness ( plotted as a colour  magnitude diagram ) .",
    "this confirms that we can make a direct calibration between the detection efficiency of the transit survey and that of the microlensing survey , allowing us to constrain the variation in planet frequency with orbital radius ( parametrised by @xmath159 in eq .",
    "( [ pldensityeq4 ] ) ) across , effectively , the entire range of orbital radii from sub - day orbits to the free - floating planet regime .",
    "table [ masstable ] lists the various fractions of planets , brown dwarfs and low - mass stars in our small planets , jupiter - radius objects and small stars regimes . in all cases",
    ", our observational setup ensures that all objects below our @xmath206 r@xmath142 cut - off are genuine small planets .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of observed transiting brown dwarfs with radii below 0.7 r@xmath142 ( figure [ mrfig ] ) . however , there are only likely to be few planets that we can confidently claim are less than 0.7 r@xmath142 in all but the most - favourable observing scenarios .",
    "statistically , however , most jupiter - radius objects we observe should be _ bona fide _ planets .",
    "simplistically , the mass corresponding to jupiter - radius planets ( @xmath50.1 to 13 m@xmath142 ) is large ( @xmath52.1 dex ) compared to that covered by jupiter - radius brown dwarfs ( 13 to @xmath5160 m@xmath142 , @xmath51.1 dex ) , leading to a preference for detecting planets .",
    "when coupled with the preferential tidal decay of orbits of massive companions , and a negative @xmath158 , this leads to a strong selection bias favouring the detection of planets over brown dwarfs and low - mass stars .",
    "any jupiter - radius object we find therefore has a @xmath596 per cent chance of being a gas - giant planet , before any other factors are considered .",
    "we note , however , that this statistic does not include the false positive rate of objects mimicking transits .",
    "conversely , we also find that most of the objects we define as small stars ( based on their radius ) are actually heavily - bloated planets , with dwarf stars representing only @xmath01030 per cent of objects .",
    "we typically probe systems with ages of @xmath125 gyr , hence any bloating is expected to be purely a thermal equilibrium effect due to absorption of light from the host star , rather than a remnant of their primordial collapse .      for our best - estimate simulations , the maximum amplitude of the doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variation signals",
    "we could expect for small stars are both @xmath0100200 @xmath207mag , exceptionally up to @xmath0300 @xmath207mag .",
    "it is unlikely that this could be detected with high confidence , even if red noise can be mitigated above our expectations .",
    "however , in some cases , it may provide a useful limit to the maximum mass of the planetary body and differentiate planetary - mass bodies from very - low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , which should produce signals a few times higher , which may be detectable in some cases .",

    "instruments such as eso - vlt / fors can theoretically reach a signal - to - noise of @xmath01000 on an @xmath213 mag star over the course of a transit time : sufficient for multi - wavelength measurements of the planet s atmosphere at secondary eclipse",
    ". however , space - based photometry would be more likely to actually obtain this quality of data due to atmospheric effects and crowding , ideally with an instruments such as the _ james webb space telescope_.",
    "we have modelled the expected number of low - mass , transiting companions detectable by exels , a proposed _ euclid _ planetary microlensing survey during a ten - month campaign over five years in a 1.64 square degree field near the galactic centre .",
    "sensible ranges of input parameters produce several thousand detections and , using typical values from the literature and conservative estimates of mission - specific parameters , we estimate @xmath04000 companions will be detectable , of which the great majority ( @xmath21490 per cent ) will be hot jupiters .",
    "physical uncertainties impart a range of error between @xmath02900 and @xmath07000 objects .",
    "we expect four - colour photometry ( vis , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 ) for @xmath020100 stars and two - colour photometry ( vis and @xmath1 ) for @xmath0400 - 1600 stars .",
    "while this may not provide data on the planets , this will be useful in discriminating stellar blends .",
    "absolute discrimination of planetary - mass objects from all transiting companions appears prohibitively difficult for all but a few objects .",
    "tidal and relativistic effects will only be detectable for planets scattered into short orbits around their hosts on timescales much shorter than the tidal inspiral time . given a list of planetary candidates , ground - based confirmation will likely only be successful on new 30-metre - class telescopes .",
    "the separation of planets from brown dwarfs and low - mass stars is probably best performed in a statistical context .",
    "although we do not fully model false - positive detections , the vast majority of the objects we detect in any scenario we have created are planets .",
    "the high angular resolution of _ euclid _ s vis instrument should make it relatively easy to distinguish contaminating blends of variable stars from transiting companions , and the clean , frequent sampling should allow us to rule out many false positive categories .    however , _",
    "euclid _ will be observing a fundamentally different parameter space to previous space - based surveys .",
    "some 70 per cent of our detections are expected to be around stars in the galactic bulge which are older than our sun , meaning such a survey could discover some of the most ancient planets in the universe .",
    "their detections therefore have implications for the historical frequency and long - term survival of planetary systems , thus the past habitability of our galaxy .",
    "we may be able to use this advanced age to obtain the strength of the tidal quality factor , @xmath178 , by comparing the period distribution planets to those in the solar neighbourhood .    despite their age , these stars _ average _ [ fe / h ] @xmath5 0 dex , meaning the formation mechanisms for planets are likely to be broadly similar .",
    "however , the large _ range _ in metallicities means that we can probe how planet abundance changes with host metallicity .",
    "spectroscopic metallicity determination should be easy for at least the brighter objects in our sample , which will also tend to be our best planet candidates due to their higher signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "most importantly , exels can provide a direct comparison between the frequency of close - in ( transiting ) and distant ( microlensed ) jupiter - like planets , free from major sources of systematic bias , for the first time .",
    "while we are limited by the mass  radius degeneracy of jupiter - radius objects , a robust comparison will be possible for objects smaller than a non - degenerate point further up the mass  radius relationship , e.g. near 2 r@xmath142 and 160 m@xmath142 .",
    "this should allow the frequency of cold jupiters to be empirically tied to that of hot jupiters for the first time .",
    "this combination of a transiting and microlensed low - mass companion survey in the galactic bulge has the potential to significantly increase our understanding of the frequency and characteristics of low - mass companions in an environment far removed from the solar neighbourhood .",
