    "particular attention has been paid to the pairing correlations that are responsible for the superfluid properties of the nucleus .",

    "this is because the hard - core potentials connect high - energy states , whose effective mass is not well described by the phenomenological edf functionals , leading to reliability issues @xcite .",
    "low - momentum interactions do not probe states too much high in energy .    along these lines , in this work we study the superfluid properties of the inner crust of neutron stars , adopting the ws approximation and solving the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations with low - momentum realistic interactions ( @xmath3 ) in the pairing channel .",

    "we studied the superfluid properties of the inner crust of neutron stars , representing the different density regions with 11 spherical ws cells . in the innermost layers close to the star core , the ws approximation turned out to break down , even at the hf level , where protons leak out of the center of the cell .",
    "the method starts to be unstable at baryonic densities @xmath4 g @xmath1 @xmath2 and it definitely breaks down at @xmath7 g @xmath1 @xmath2 . the ws approximation should not be used whereas these instabilities occur .    within the limits of applicability of the method , we performed fully self - consistent hfb calculations , based on skyrme functionals plus realistic pairing interactions .",
    "the pairing interaction has been taken as the low - momentum evolution of the argonne av18 potential .",

    "the results obtained with effective pairing interactions ( namely , the gogny d1 interactions and a density - dependent contact force ) differ substancially from the results obtained with the realistic pairing interactions .",
    "not only the non - arbitrariness of the latter ensures a higher reliability , but also the availability of a high - precision separable representation of low - momentum realistic potentials makes the calculations feasible even in the inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "hence , we advocate for adopting these realistic pairing interactions to get more reliable results when applying microscopic edf theories to the inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "higher - order pairing correlations are expected to play an important role in the inner crust of neutron stars , where the exchange of collective vibrations leads to a repulsive interaction and , consequently , to a suppression of the pairing gap @xcite . at sufficiently high densities ( @xmath159 ) , three - body forces",

    "a quantitative assessment of this effect requires all contributions to be treated consistently and represents the subject of a future work .",
    "recently , ab - initio quantum monte carlo calculations have been carried out for low - density infinite neutron matter ( @xmath160 ) @xcite , with an effort to understand the differences with other monte carlo results @xcite .",
    "a quenching of the mean - field pairing gap is predicted , resulting in a larger pairing gap than what previous calculations found @xcite .    in this work we also presented a detailed study of the cooper - pair spatial properties , which showed how the coherence length in the inner crust depends on the strength of the pairing interaction .",
