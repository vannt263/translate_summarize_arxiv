    "temporal logic provides a comprehensive framework for understanding time through the use of model theory and modalities .",
    "in particular , we can understand linear , branching , discrete , dense , or dedekind complete time flows by simple conditions on a linear ordering in a model . for applications to game theory",
    ", we will be interested in branching time flows .",
    "let @xmath7 be a frame where @xmath0 is a set of time points determining a time flow and @xmath8 is a strict ordering relation , that is , @xmath8 is antireflexive , antisymmetric , and transitive .",
    "we now define the ordering relation which is used in branching temporal logic to define a `` tree of time '' .",
    "a branching frame @xmath7 is a frame where @xmath9 is strictly partially ordered by @xmath8 for all @xmath10 .    for discussing one particular branch in the tree of time",
    "we consider histories in @xmath0 in order to be able to determine if modal formulas are satisfied when referring to only a single branch of the tree of time .",
    "given a branching frame @xmath7 , a history @xmath11 in @xmath0 is a maximal linearly ordered subset of @xmath0 , where @xmath12 is the set of all histories in @xmath0 .    a branching model of time results by assigning a valuation to the time points of a branching frame .    a branching model of time",
    "@xmath13 is a branching frame with a valuation @xmath14 .",
    "we can now define the traditional alethic modalities of necessity and possibility as follows .",
    "let @xmath15 be an arbitrary formula and define the two alethic modalities , necessity ( @xmath16 ) and possibility ( @xmath17 ) , as follows :    * @xmath18 if and only if @xmath19 when @xmath20 so that @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "* @xmath23 if and only if @xmath24 such that @xmath20 so that @xmath25 with @xmath22 .",
    "we then have that necessity gives us a condition on all possible time flows emanating into the future from one time point and that possibility gives us a condition on at least one time flow emanating into the future from one time point , as is illustrated in the following figure .     with certain modal formulas satisfied .",
    "]    we now consider articulated histories , which split histories into the past time points and possible future time points .",
    "an articulated history of a time point @xmath10 is a pair @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the set of all past time points of @xmath28 in all histories containing @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a set of future time points of @xmath28 which determines a unique history @xmath30 .",
    "using the idea of articulated histories , the set of time points @xmath0 can be partitioned into time points which are considered to coincide at the same instant .",
    "a set of time points @xmath31 belongs to an instant @xmath32 if @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the temporal syntax and semantics constructed in the previous section can now be applied to game theory by considering time flows , or histories , as ways in which a game is played , time points as turns , and a partition of the instants of the time points into turns associated with a player in the game .",
    "we now call the branching model of time @xmath35 a game @xmath36 and let @xmath37 be a formula which denotes that the game is a tie .    in an @xmath1-player game @xmath36 ,",
    "the @xmath38 instant @xmath39 is player @xmath40 s turn if @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , player @xmath40 wins the game at a turn @xmath28 in a history @xmath42 if @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ".    simply put , player @xmath40 wins if the game ends in a non - tie after player @xmath40 s turn , as @xmath47 means that there are no future turns to be played .",
    "the combinatorial analysis of @xmath36 can be simplified by considering formulas which will be satisfied at a turn @xmath28 if player @xmath40 wins or loses at a turn @xmath28 .",
    "that is , define the formula @xmath48 to mean that player @xmath40 wins and define the formula @xmath49 to mean that player @xmath40 loses as follows @xmath50 @xmath51    it is clear that @xmath52 , which is that a tie implies player @xmath40 did not win and that player @xmath40 did not lose . observe that a non - tie does not imply anything about player @xmath40 winning or losing as we have that there exists a 2-player game @xmath36 such that @xmath53 for which @xmath54    namely , this holds for @xmath55 in the following 2-player game .    ,",
    "where the yellow instants are player 1 s turns and the blue instants are player 2 s turns . ]    the notions of winning strategy and drawing strategy can now be defined by noticing the cardinalities of the future time points of an articulated history .",
    "intuitively , a winning strategy for player @xmath40 is a response to the moves of the previous player so that player @xmath40 can win no matter what moves the other players make ; similarly , a drawing strategy is a strategy which does not guarantee a win for a particular player , but guarantees that that player does not lose .    in an @xmath1-player game @xmath36 , a winning strategy exists for player @xmath40 if for every sequence of moves @xmath56 by player @xmath57 , there exists a sequence of moves @xmath58 by player @xmath40 such that @xmath59 @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath41 .    the temporal formalism developed for discussing a branching model of time",
    "can be applied to give a proof of zermelo s theorem , a classic result in game theory originally proved in a german paper from 1913 by zermelo .",
    "an english presentation of the proof in modern notation is given in @xcite .",
    "a finite game is a game that must necessarily terminate in a finite number of moves , that is , @xmath62 for all future histories of @xmath63 , where @xmath63 is the initial turn defined as satisfying the property that @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "zero - sum games are games where each player can either win or lose , that is , @xmath46 , @xmath66 .",
    "( zermelo ) every finite zero - sum 2-player game is determined ( one of the two players has a winning strategy ) .",
    "we prove zermelo s theorem by induction on the length of the game @xmath67 , defined to be the maximum cardinality of the future time points in an articulated history , that is @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 then we have that @xmath70 because @xmath36 is zero - sum , and so @xmath36 is determined .",
    "so , assume that every finite zero - sum 2-player game @xmath36 is determined for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "then let @xmath36 be an arbitrary game with @xmath73 and consider the set of all time points on player 2 s first turn , denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be arbitrary and notice that @xmath76 is the root of the subgame @xmath77 with @xmath78 . by the induction hypothesis we then have that @xmath79 is determined and so we have that either @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath80 then @xmath82 and if @xmath81 then @xmath83 and so we have that @xmath36 is determined . therefore , by induction we have that every finite zero - sum 2-player is determined .",
    "in order to illustrate the temporal formalism developed in the preceding section , we give an exhaustive temporal analysis of the game of nim @xcite . in the game of nim , two players called alice and bob choose either one or two tokens on their turn from the same pile of six tokens .",
    "the winner of the game is the player who removes the last token .",
    "nim is a zero - sum game because a win for alice is a loss for bob and a win for bob is a loss for alice , finite because there are at most 6 turns , and 2-player by definition .",
    "therefore , nim is determined by zermelo s theorem and so we know that there is a winning strategy for either alice or bob . if alice goes first then bob has a winning strategy which is as follows : if alice takes two tokens then bob takes one token and if alice takes one token then bob takes two tokens .",
    "let @xmath84 , resp .",
    "@xmath85 , denote alice ( bob ) taking one token from the pile and let @xmath86 , resp .",
    "@xmath85 , denote alice ( bob ) taking two tokens from the pile .",
    "then we have that the winning strategy for bob can be formalized as follows .",
    "let @xmath87 be an arbitrary sequence of moves by alice , where @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 then it means that the game has already ended .",
    "define a function as follows , @xmath90 then the strategy @xmath91 ensures that @xmath92 , where @xmath61 . this illustrates how the satisfaction of a series of modal formulas , namely @xmath93 at each @xmath61 can capture the notion of a winning strategy in game theory .",
    "it is interesting to observe the asymptotic combinatorial properties of any structure , and in particular , we can comment on games and other modal frames satisfying particular axioms by analyzing their asymptotic properties .",
    "given a set of time points @xmath0 , a strict partial ordering @xmath8 on @xmath0 defines a branching frame @xmath7 .",
    "the relation @xmath8 determines the rules of the game , that is , @xmath95 if it possible for a player to make a move which alters the configuration of the game from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "so , we have that the number of distinct games on a set @xmath0 with cardinality @xmath1 is equal to the number of strict partial orderings of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath98 be a non - strict partial order then define the reflexive reduction of @xmath98 by @xmath99 if and only if @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath8 be a strict partial order and define the reflexive closure of @xmath8 by @xmath100 if and only if @xmath99 or @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , there exists a bijection between the set of all strict partial orders and non - strict partial orders and so the number of strict partial orders on a set of @xmath1 elements is equal to the number of non - strict partial orders on a set of @xmath1 elements .    by @xcite , we have that the number of partial orders on a set of @xmath1 elements is equal to @xmath103 therefore , since the number of distinct games on @xmath0 is equal to the number of strict partial orderings of @xmath0 which is equal to the number of non - strict partial orders of @xmath0 , the number of distinct games on a set @xmath0 with cardinality @xmath1 is asymptotically @xmath94    a generalization of this theorem can be provided for other modal axioms being satisfied in a kripke frame @xmath104 .",
    "that is , we specifically restricted our attention to branching frames @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a strict partial order . yet , we can provide asymptotic bounds on other characteristics of kripke frames based on the number of relations on a set of @xmath1 elements of a certain type .",
    "for example , consider @xmath105 frames , that is , frames @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the set of all possible world and @xmath108 is a relation , for which there exists a valuation that satisfies the following three axioms at every @xmath109 : @xmath110 s@xmath2 modal frames can alternatively be characterized by @xmath111 and @xmath112 along with two additional axioms @xmath113    this equivalent characterization of s@xmath2 modal frames follows from the following theorem .",
    "it is a standard result in modal logic that s@xmath2 can be alternatively characterized this way and a proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "now , using the scott - lemmon result @xcite , we can show a correspondence between s@xmath2 modal frames and equivalence relations .",
    "this correspondence will be essential in our combinatorial analysis of s@xmath2 modal frames .    _",
    "( scott - lemmon ) _",
    "+ in any frame @xmath3 with @xmath117 , @xmath118 implies that for arbitrary @xmath119 , @xmath120 , where the relation is defined by @xmath121 if @xmath122 , by @xmath123 if @xmath124 , and by @xmath125 if @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath106 be an arbitrary s@xmath2 modal frame .",
    "that is , assume @xmath127 and @xmath115 .",
    "firstly , we claim that @xmath104 is reflexive . by the scott - lemmon result",
    ", @xmath128 implies @xmath129 which is that @xmath130 .",
    "this reduces to @xmath131 , hence @xmath104 is reflexive since @xmath132 are arbitrary . by theorem [ 54btheorem ] , we have @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "secondly , we claim that @xmath104 is symmetric . by the scott - lemmon result",
    ", @xmath133 implies @xmath134 which is that @xmath135 , hence @xmath104 is symmetric since @xmath136 are arbitrary .",
    "lastly , we claim that @xmath104 is transitive . by the scott - lemmon result we have that @xmath137 implies @xmath138 which is that @xmath139 , so @xmath140 .",
    "hence @xmath104 is transitive since @xmath136 are arbitrary .",
    "therefore , every s@xmath2 modal frame is reflexive , symmetric , and transitive .",
    "we remark that the number of isomorphism classes of s@xmath2 modal frames is the number of non - isomorphic s@xmath2 modal frames , by the definition of isomorphism class .",
    "the following lemma is necessary in order to study the combinatorics of non - isomorphic s@xmath2 modal frames .        if we have that there exists a bijection @xmath148 such that @xmath149 , @xmath145 , then we say that the two relations are isomorphic and write @xmath150 .",
    "we now have the sufficient background to provide our combinatorial analysis of s@xmath2 modal frames as a generalization of theorem [ gamenumber ] .      by theorem",
    "[ s5equiv ] and lemma [ isolemma ] we have that there exists a bijection between the set of all s@xmath2 modal frames @xmath106 with @xmath4 and the set of all equivalence classes on @xmath1 elements .",
    "the number of non - isomorphic equivalence relations on a set of @xmath1 elements is the number of integer partitions of @xmath1 from page 57 in @xcite , so @xmath151 is equal to @xmath5 , the number of integer partitions of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the theorem holds due to the expression for @xmath5 given by rademacher @xcite .",
    "let @xmath106 be an arbitrary modal frame with @xmath4 .",
    "by @xcite , we have that the number of non - isomorphic relations on a set of @xmath1 elements is @xmath156 since the number of relations on @xmath107 is @xmath157 and there are @xmath158 bijections from @xmath107 to @xmath107 , the number of non - isomorphic relations on @xmath107 is asymptotically @xmath159 for some @xmath160 .",
    "so , since we have that @xmath161 , corollary [ asympframe ] implies that @xmath162 hence , @xmath163 thus , since theorem [ framenumber ] says that @xmath5 is the number of non - isomorphic s@xmath2 modal frames with @xmath1 possible worlds , and @xmath164 is the number of non - isomorphic relations on a set of @xmath1 elements , we have that the probability that @xmath104 is an s@xmath2 modal frame is zero .",
    "we remark that despite the independent interest of the statement and proof of theorem [ zeroprob ] as an application of analytic number theory to modal logic , potential philosophical applications of theorem [ zeroprob ] exist .",
    "one possible example could be a critique of alvin plantinga s version of the ontological argument @xcite by noticing that the penultimate conclusion , `` it is necessarily true that an omniscient , omnipotent and perfectly good being exists . '' , assumes s@xmath2 modal logic ."
