    "combining both results leads to an average optical depth of @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "while this observed optical depth towards the is too small to account for a full dark halo of compact objects ( expected @xmath4 ) , it is much too large to be explained by the contribution from known populations of low - mass stars in the disks of the milky way and the : based on star counts , the contribution from the disk of our galaxy is found to be @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , and the global rate from known stars in both galaxies has been estimated by several authors to be @xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) of that observed .",
    "moreover , the location of a few lenses has been determined , either through the non - detection of parallax effect for 97-smc-1 ( @xcite ) , or through the observation of the caustic crossing in the case of binary lenses , for 98-smc-1 ( afonso et al .",

    "the case for the latter is still unclear however , since the measured lens velocity , incompatible with a galactic halo lens unless the source happens to be a binary star with the appropriate separation , seems too low for a disk star .",
    "it has been pointed out by several authors ( kerins & evans 1999 , @xcite ) that the fact that the observed binary lenses are all located in the clouds might indicate that _ all _ observed events arise from clouds deflectors . indeed , if the two observed binary lenses with caustic crossings are in the clouds , then the expected number of self - lensing caustic crossing events has to be greater than .53 at 90% c.l . a very conservative estimate of the fraction of caustic crossing events ( @xcite , @xcite ) implies that we expect more than 5 background self - lensing events , which is far from negligible as compared to the total number of observed events .",

    "as shown in ( palanque - delabrouille et al 1998 ) , the could be thick enough to yield an expected optical depth as large as @xmath7 , compatible with the current observations towards this line - of - sight .",
    "a more thorough exploration of possible models therefore appears worthwhile .",
    "gould ( 1995 ) noticed that the optical depth associated to the self - lensing of a stellar disk , a good approximation for the bulk of the matter , depends only on the vertical velocity dispersion @xmath8 of the stars : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the inclination of the disk .",
    "measurements of stellar velocities in the are difficult because of its distance . only the brightest stars are resolved .",
    "gould based his analysis on the ch objects studied by cowley & hartwick ( 1991 ) .",

    ". a velocity dispersion of @xmath13 20 km / s led gould to the conclusion that the optical depth for self - lensing could not exceed @xmath14 , well below the measured value of @xmath15 .",
    "however , carbon stars are a peculiar population .",
    "they have left the main sequence ( ) on which they have spent at most @xmath16 gyr , the age of the . the average lifetime of a star on the decreases with the initial stellar mass @xmath17 as @xmath18 \\right)^{-3 } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] so that the oldest carbon stars observed today had an initial mass larger than @xmath13 1 @xmath19 . assuming a salpeter imf for the ( geha et al .",
    "1998 ) and adopting the star formation history derived by the same authors lead to the conclusion that approximatively 75 % of the sample analyzed by cowley & hartwick ( 1991 ) has formed less than 2 gyr ago , during a recent stellar burst .",
    "the velocity dispersion of 20 km / s refers therefore to young objects whereas the bulk of the population is not dominated by young stars ( geha et al .",

    "( 1991 ) have measured the radial velocities of long period variables ( lpv ) in the and showed that while young and intermediate lpv s had a dispersion velocity in the range between 12 and 25 km / s , the old lpv s had a significantly larger dispersion velocity ranging from 31 to 45 km / s .",
    "the increase of the velocity dispersion with the age of stars is a well - known fact .",
    "bienaym et al .",
    "( 1987 ) have modeled stellar populations in the milky way disk and showed that while @xmath20 km / s at birth , it increases up to 25 km / s for an age of @xmath21 gyr .",
    "that is why the characteristic thickness for o and b stars which formed very recently is @xmath13 200 pc whereas it reaches @xmath13 700 pc for solar type objects .",
    "wielen ( 1977 ) has shown that the velocity dispersion @xmath22 and the age @xmath23 of a stellar population are related by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the initial velocity dispersion .",

    "stars diffuse in velocity space . for the milky way ,",
    "wielen obtained a global diffusion coefficient @xmath26 whereas he got a value 6 times smaller for vertical motions .",
    "we estimate therefore that the quoted value @xmath27 20 km / s is only representative of the youngest stars and that the bulk of the populations are older , hence with larger velocity dispersions . the favored star formation history ( model e of geha et al .",
    "1998 ) has a star formation rate which remains constant for 10 gyr and then increases by a factor of three for the past 2 gyr .",

    "this is consistent with hst stellar counts in the as discussed by geha et al .",
    "the normalization factor is obtained from the requirement that the global surface mass density @xmath53 is recovered once the contributions @xmath54 of the various stellar components are added together .",

    "relation [ sigma_mestel ] gives a surface mass density of @xmath66 , hence a mass - to - light ratio of 1.71 , in good agreement with our model ( the effect of extinction is neglected ) .",

    "the only relevant dynamical parameter is actually the relationship between the surface mass density and @xmath8 .",
    "stars of different masses may well have the same velocity dispersions .",

    "their velocity dispersion @xmath34 is the largest of all species .",
    "between 1 and 2 @xmath19 ( our most massive bin ) , the dispersion @xmath8 is obtained from the diffusion equation ( [ wielen ] ) and from noticing that the lifetime decreases as @xmath71 .",

    "they are shown in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] as a function of the distance to the center of the .",
    "there is a strong decrease of both quantities with the radius , which can be used to test statistically the location of the lenses detected in microlensing experiments .",
    "note that the effect is even more drastic in the ellipsoidal model than in the disk model of the : in the latter , the increased thickness at large radius was compensating the decrease in surface density .",
    "the predicted distributions of event durations , normalized to a maximum value of 1 , are shown in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] at two different distances from the center of the .",
    "since there is no cut - off in the ellipsoidal model , the duration distribution is nearly independent of the maximum velocity dispersion at all radii .",
    "we have presented here two models for the , both consistent with the known properties of the cloud ( rotation velocity , surface light density ) , allowing for a multi - mass stellar population , each associated with a specific velocity dispersion .",
    "this correlation between mass and velocity dispersion is justified by the fact that lighter stars are on the average older and had the time to diffuse in velocity space .",
    "these models of the predict an optical depth in agreement with that observed by the and the collaborations : at a distance of 1  kpc from the center , the disk model yields @xmath156 for a velocity dispersion of the lightest and therefore oldest objects of 80  km / s , and the ellipsoidal model yields @xmath157 for @xmath158  km / s .",
    "the optical depth which we have derived results from the interplay of various effects . in the case of the disk model , for instance , gould s estimate is only recovered in the thin disk limit . setting the various stellar velocities at the same value of 80  km / s and pushing the at infinite distance from the milky way",
    ", we get @xmath159 , in agreement with relation ( [ gould ] ) .",
    "if now we assume the same distribution of stellar velocities as in table  [ model_a ] , with velocities ranging from 20 to 80  km / s , the optical depth becomes @xmath160 .",
    "because the sources have small velocity dispersions , they are fairly concentrated towards the disk , hence a decrease of @xmath96 by a factor of @xmath161 .",
    "the proeminent effect is actually the presence of the cut - off @xmath162 which we have enforced . at 3  kpc from the center , the optical depth decreases from @xmath160 to @xmath163 . at small radii ,",
    "the surface mass density is large and the disk thickness @xmath91 is small as compared to @xmath164 .",
    "there , the decrease of @xmath96 is less sensitive than towards the outer fringes of the disk , where the cutoff suppression is quite noticeable .",
    "taking furthermore into account the finite distance of 52  kpc to the implies a minor decrease of the optical depth which becomes now @xmath165 .",
    "finally , tidal forces tend to stretch the disk , hence a final value of @xmath166 .",
    "if the rotation velocity of the @xmath167 is set equal to 80  km / s instead of 65 , the main impact on our disk model is an increased surface mass density .",
    "as the disk becomes thinner , the suppression of the optical depth resulting from the above mentioned cut - off is less sensitive , hence an increased optical depth at large radii . at 3  kpc ,",
    "the optical depth becomes @xmath168 .    in order to model various m / l ratios ,",
    "we have simply modified the relative contribution of our first stellar bin . that population corresponds to faint stars . still with @xmath169 and at @xmath170 3  kpc ,",
    "an increase of the m / l ratio by a factor of 2 and 5 respectively leads to 9.43 and @xmath171 .",
    "the optical depth is thus not sensitive to the precise value of the m / l ratio , insofar as the disk dynamics is dominated by the faint and low - mass species .",
    "ellipsoids have a lenticular shape . as the radius @xmath33 increases , their surface mass density drops , and the system becomes thinner towards the edges .",
    "increasing the rotation velocity without changing the velocity dispersion of the various stellar species does not change much the optical depth .",
    "two opposite effects are actually at stake : the first is that the mass densities are larger , the second that the stellar populations are flattened towards the disk .",
    "if now the dispersion velocities @xmath8 are scaled to the rotation velocity , in order to maintain the shape of the ellipsoids  which depends to first order on the ratio @xmath172  increasing the rotation speed from 65 to 80  km / s results into a significantly larger optical depth .",
    "if we set @xmath173 and @xmath167 = 80  km / s , the optical depth at 1 and 3  kpc becomes respectively 2.19 and @xmath174 .",
    "that set of values actually correspond to an mass at 5  kpc of @xmath175 ( hughes et al .",
    "1991 ) that increases up to @xmath176 at 10  kpc ( schommer et al .",
    "1992 ) .    reexamining the status of event",
    "macho - lmc-9 appears worthwhile . as pointed out in ( bennett , 1996 ) , its measured projected relative velocity was too low both for a galactic halo event and for self - lensing with a standard disk model .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the distribution of the expected projected relative velocity for the 80 km / s disk and the 45 km / s ellipsoidal models , along with the measured velocity , for two values of the horizontal velocity dispersion , null or equal to the vertical one  the reality being probably inbetween .",
    "the measured value is compatible with an ellipsoidal model , but only compatible with a disk model if the horizontal velocity dispersion is not too high .",
    "reconsidering the shape of the and the velocity distributions of its stellar components thus appears to be quite valuable .",
    "two observational projects could yield interesting results in regards to this new perspective , and would help to check the validity of the assumptions made here",
    ". both would be of great consequence for microlensing experiments .",
    "the first of these is the measure of dispersion velocities for rr - lyrae in the .",
    "they indeed form a well - defined sample of very old stars ( more than 10 gyr old ) .",
    "if our model is correct , they should be found to have a higher velocity dispersion than previously measured stars .",
    "the second project is actually a pure extension to the present microlensing experiments .",
    "as evidenced in this paper , self - lensing in the can be tested quite accurately with the spatial evolution of the microlensing parameters such as optical depth and event rate .",
    "searching for microlensing events on as large an area as possible over the would be a very powerful tool to discriminate between halo and deflectors , because of the strong decrease of @xmath96 and @xmath177 with the distance to the center of the in the case of self - lensing .",
    "in addition to the implications such observations would have on the galactic dark matter issue , they would be of great use for a better understanding of the structure of the , the nearest galaxy to the milky way . furthermore",
    ", as shown in ( gould 1998 ) , monitoring as large an area as possible on the , using the same exposure time on inner and outer fields , optimizes the total number of expected events , even for galactic halo lensing",
    ". such a strategy would be even more productive if associated with a real - time trigger and a high precision follow - up strategy , yielding high quality microlensing light - curves on which testing for parallax effect would provide information on the location of the lenses .",
