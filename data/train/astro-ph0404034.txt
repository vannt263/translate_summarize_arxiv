    "we are carrying out a study of the structure of 72 representative nearby early - type galaxies and spiral bulges based on measurements of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kinematics and line - strengths of stars and gas with ` sauron ` , a custom - built panoramic integral - field spectrograph for the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , la palma . `",
    "sauron `  is based on the ` tiger ` microlens concept ( @xcite @xcite ; see also @xcite @xcite ) , and is described in detail in paper i ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the objectives of the ` sauron `  survey are summarized in paper ii ( @xcite @xcite ) , which also contains the definition and global properties of the sample . here",
    "we present maps of the stellar kinematics for the 48 elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies in the survey .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas , the line - strength distributions , similar measurements for the spiral galaxies in the sample , and higher spatial resolution integral - field observations obtained with ` oasis `  on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) will be presented separately .",
    "the data and maps presented in this paper will be made available via the ` sauron `  web page http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl / sauron/.    in section  [ sec : observations ] we summarize our observational campaign , as well as the principles of the data reduction and the measurement of the line - of - sight velocity distributions .",

    "most of the galaxies in this sample are contaminated by significant emission lines of e.g. , h@xmath5 , the [ o@xmath6iii]@xmath74959,5007 or [ n@xmath6i]@xmath75198,5200 doublets .",
    "this causes problems for techniques working in fourier space , e.g. the fourier correlation quotient ( fcq , @xcite @xcite ) or the cross correlation fitting ( ccf , @xcite @xcite ) techniques , as they do not permit direct masking of specific spectral regions .",
    "such methods can obviously make use of continuous spectral regions not or weakly affected by emission lines .",
    "however , considering the short spectral domain provided by ` sauron ` , and the significant fraction of galaxies found to exhibit the emission lines which punctuate this region , these techniques are not well suited to these data .",
    "for this reason we opted for the use of a direct pixel - fitting ( pxf ) routine to extract the kinematics , allowing emission - line regions to be easily masked ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we emphasize that all results obtained with this new implementation are fully consistent with the early results presented in paper  ii .",
    "we derive the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( hereafter losvd ) parametrized by a gauss - hermite function @xcite for each spectrum using the pxf routine : the algorithm finds the best fit to a galaxy spectrum ( rebinned in @xmath8 ) by convolving a template stellar spectrum with the corresponding losvd .",
    "this provides the mean velocity @xmath1 and the velocity dispersion @xmath2 , as well as the higher order gauss - hermite moments @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which quantify the asymmetric and symmetric departures of the losvd from a pure gaussian ( related to the skewness and kurtosis respectively ) .",
    "although this appears as a conceptually simple procedure , there are two critical issues ( not specific to ` sauron ` ) to carefully consider to obtain robust and reliable kinematic measurements .    although robust against the presence of emission lines , pxf is sensitive to template mismatch , in contrast to ccf and fcq which minimize the coupling between different absorption features by restricting the analysis to the main peak of the cross correlation between the template and the galaxy spectra .",
    "the use of pxf thus requires templates which match closely the galaxy spectrum under scrutiny .",
    "the derivation of optimal stellar templates must be conducted for every individual spectrum ( as galaxies may e.g. exhibit significant metallicity or age gradients within the ` sauron `  field of view ) .",
    "this is achieved via the use of an extensive stellar library spanning a large range of metallicities and ages .",
    "we primarily included 19 spectra from the library of single - metallicity stellar population models of @xcite , and added 5 spectra from the jones stellar library ( from which vazdekis models are built ; @xcite @xcite ) to provide spectra with strong mg@xmath9 indices .",
    "this also requires the inclusion of additive legendre polynomials to adapt the continuum shape of the templates .    when measuring the gauss - hermite moments of the losvd up to @xmath4 , undersampling becomes important when the observed dispersion is less than about 2 pixels ( equivalent to around 120  for ` sauron ` ) . below this dispersion",
    "a very high @xmath10 is required to accurately measure the gauss - hermite parameters . at our minimum @xmath11 , the data are therefore unable to significantly constrain all the @xmath12 parameters simultaneously in the undersampled regime , and the scatter in the measurements increases dramatically .",
    "in this situation one usually wants to reduce the parametric form of the losvd to a simple gaussian .",
    "we therefore used the penalized pixel - fitting ( hereafter ppxf ) method developed by @xcite to perform this biasing of the solution towards a gaussian in a statistically motivated and automatic way , as a function of both the @xmath10 of the spectra , and the observed @xmath2 .",
    "we implemented both the template optimization and the penalization directly into our pxf routine .",
    "this works for each individual galaxy spectrum as follows .",
    "the direct pixel fitting is a non - linear least - squares problem , for the parameters @xmath12 of the losvd , which is solved using a sequential quadratic programming method including bounds ( nag routine e04unf ) . at each iteration",
    "we find the best fitting linear combination of the stellar templates ( with positive weights ) convolved with the corresponding losvd .",
    "this includes the additive polynomials and provides the optimal template for that specific set of kinematic parameters .",
    "the residual vector @xmath13 between the observed spectrum and the convolved optimal spectrum is then derived and the penalization term is added to obtain a ` perturbed ' vector of residuals @xmath14 , which is fed into the nonlinear optimization routine .    the perturbed vector has the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an adjustable parameter of order unity , @xmath17 is the integrated squared deviation of the losvd from its best fitting gaussian @xcite , and @xmath18 is a robust estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals .",
    "the qualitative interpretation of the perturbation can be illustrated by noting that for @xmath19 , an amplitude of 0.1 for @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( 10% deviation from a gaussian ) requires an improvement of at least 0.5% of the unperturbed @xmath18 to be accepted by the optimization routine as a decrease of the perturbed residuals @xmath14 .",
    "setting @xmath20 provides a non - penalized pxf routine .",
    "after extensive testing we adopted a value of @xmath21 , which makes sure the bias is always small compared to the measurement errors , when @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "see @xcite for details on this ppxf technique .",
    "we estimated errors by a monte - carlo method in which the kinematic parameters are derived from many realizations of the input spectrum obtained by adding poissonian noise to a model galaxy spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : errors ] summarizes the results from such simulations .",
    "the significant damping of @xmath3 and @xmath4 towards zero is visible when @xmath24  , but as noted above , this damping effect decreases with increasing @xmath10 and becomes almost negligible for @xmath25 , as we have in the center of most of our galaxies .",
    "for a @xmath10 of 60 , the @xmath26 errors on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are 4  , 5  , 0.03 and 0.03 respectively for @xmath27  , and 8  , 7  , 0.02 and 0.02 respectively for @xmath28  . at higher @xmath10 ,",
    "the errors scale roughly inversely proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "these estimates are only lower limits since they do not account for the effect of template and continuum mismatch ( appendix  [ sec : mismatch ] ) .",
    "error maps will be made available with the public data release .",
    "of 60 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and for velocity dispersions between 50 and 360  .",
    "the solid line in the top panels show the difference between the measured ( via ppxf ) and the input values for the mean velocity @xmath1 ( left ) and the velocity dispersion @xmath2 ( right ) . in the bottom panels , we show the recovered @xmath3 ( left ) and @xmath4 ( right ) values .",
    "the dotted lines illustrate the @xmath26 error on these measurements at constant input velocity dispersion . ]      in order to assess the robustness of the method described above , we conducted an extensive series of tests .",
    "we first carefully inspected the fits of the observed spectra obtained for a number of galaxies and these were always found to be excellent ( see appendix  [ sec : fits ] for some illustrations ) .",
    "we checked that the kinematic measurements were not affected by the details of the input library .",
    "most galaxies required a legendre polynomial of degree 6 for the pixel fitting .",
    "for a few galaxies we had to impose a higher degree ( 10 ) to properly fit the spectral shape .",
    "we verified that this did not artificially bias the kinematic measurements , even the more sensitive higher order gauss ",
    "hermite moments @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ". we also found that applying either multiplicative or additive polynomials led to perfectly consistent results .",
    "all tests were performed with two completely independent implementations of the ppxf method and both gave indistinguishable results .",
    "the stellar kinematics of all 48 galaxies was also extracted using fcq in combination with the gas - cleaning procedure described in paper  ii . for galaxies not severely affected by gas emission the two methods produced fully consistent results ( see section  [ sec : fcq ] ) .",
    "we have already shown in paper  ii that the ` sauron `  stellar and gas kinematics are consistent with published data . to have a more global view of the sample",
    ", we performed a comparison between the central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath31 from the ` sauron `  data and from published values .",
    "we made use of three main sources which include a significant overlap with the ` sauron `  target list , namely the 7 samurai ( @xcite @xcite ) , the weighted averaged values compiled by @xcite and the compilation of data gathered from papers by prugniel and simien and available via the hypercat on - line catalog ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "our measurements were derived by averaging ( luminosity - weighted ) dispersion values within a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath32 , but imposing a minimum aperture of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 pixels ) .",
    "a linear regression applied to the combined dataset provides a slope of @xmath35 and an average residual of @xmath36  .",
    "the average residuals for each individual dataset are all consistent with zero and with the scatter expected from the quadratically summed error bars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ) : @xmath37  for the 7 samurai , @xmath38  for @xcite and @xmath39  for the data of @xcite .",
    "there is no measurable trend for sub - samples defined either for @xmath40  or @xmath41  .",

    "this includes ngc  474 , ngc  2699 , ngc  3384 , ngc  4262 and ngc  4477 .",
    "some objects display an increase in @xmath2 along the photometric major - axis associated with a flattening or turnover of the mean velocity gradient along the same axis , for example ngc  4550 and ngc  4473 .",
    "kinematically decoupled components ( kdcs ) , showing either a twist in the nuclear kinematic axis or a central velocity field clearly distinct from the rest of the galaxy , are evident in a number of maps , for example ngc  3414 , ngc  3608 , ngc  4458 , ngc  5198 , ngc  5813 , ngc  5831 , ngc  5982 , and are detected at smaller ( apparent ) scales in ngc  4150 , ngc  4382 , ngc  4621 , ngc  7332 and ngc  7457 .",
    "some of these were known previously , others are new . appendix  [ sec : list ] contains a brief description of these structures , including references to previous long - slit work on these objects .",
