    "in broad terms , there are two very different ways in which galaxies could have formed .",
    "the first , which we shall refer to as the monolithic formation idea , is that a large cloud of primordial gas collapsed rapidly to produce either an elliptical or lenticular galaxy , or perhaps the spheroidal bulge of a spiral galaxy @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of monolithic formation is that it seems consistent with the observational facts that most such systems have relatively little angular momentum and that they contain mostly old stars .",
    "the second way galaxies might have formed is through the hierarchical accumulation of smaller clumps of gas and stars into larger structures that became the galaxies we see today @xcite . within that view",
    ", there would be a continuum of mergers between clumps of varying masses and angular momenta .",
    "some mergers would lead to bursts of massive star formation , while others would not .",
    "galaxy formation would be drawn out over a long period , perhaps continuing to the present epoch , where we still see mergers and violent interactions between galaxies , along with the possible formation of tidal dwarfs .",
    "the red colours of today s e and s0 galaxies would be explained if most of the stars were produced in the original merger participants .",
    "determining the observational properties of the different classes of galaxies offers a way to discriminate between the possibilities . until the iras database was available",
    ", the conventional wisdom was that elliptical and lenticular galaxies had little or no gaseous interstellar medium  this was reinforced by the general paucity of hi emission .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite find that most s0s have @xmath1 in solar units , but with large scatter , which is 3 - 6 times lower than spirals @xcite .",
    "the surveys of atomic gas in early - type galaxies would of course miss the molecular content , which we now know dominates the ism near the centers of spirals .",
    "the iras results motivated a few surveys of co emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wh ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the co surveys were much less complete in terms of sample size than those for hi , the general conclusion was that in the iras - selected galaxies the interstellar medium  at least near the centers  was not too different from that in normal , isolated spirals .",
    "comparison of the molecular and far - infrared properties showed that the process of star formation in lenticulars is broadly similar to that in field spirals .",
    "it seems unlikely , however , that the gaseous contents of the galaxies selected using far - infrared criteria are representative of the bulk of lenticulars , because most normal s0s have little or no far - infrared emission .",
    "@xcite looked at 10 galaxies lacking optical emission lines , to investigate a more typical sample .",
    "their detection of six sources led them to suggest that most normal s0s contain significant amounts of cool , dense gas , which for unexplained reasons is not producing massive new stars .",
    "although s0s are dominated by @xmath2 year old stars , their low gas content can not merely be due to early , very efficient astration , where the gas is simply locked into stars or blown out by winds from massive stars and supernovae produced during a huge initial starburst . in the simplest ( closed box )",
    "view of galaxy evolution , one expects to find gas that has subsequently been returned to the ism by evolving low - mass stars , and the latter contribution should be very large . in general , the total mass of returned gas m@xmath3 scales with the present blue luminosity as m@xmath3 = kl@xmath4 , with both quantities in solar units .",
    "* hereafter fg ) adopt a reasonable return rate for a 10 gyr old population , that is , the product of an assumed planetary nebula formation rate and mass loss by stars near 1 @xmath5 . assuming the rate to be constant over the galaxy lifetime implies that recycled gas alone should presently give k@xmath6 .",
    "more complex models of gas return within the monolithic galaxy evolution scenario ( e.g. @xcite ) predict values more than an order of magnitude larger , owing to the early contributions of massive stars during and after the spike of initial star formation .    in summary",
    ", there is very little understanding of how much gas is present in field s0s , of its properties , and of how these properties might have arisen . to improve this situation , and we hope thereby our understanding of what s0 galaxies are , has been the primary motivation for this study .",
    "the initial sample comprises all entries in the nearby galaxies catalog @xcite having type -3 to 0 inclusive , declination @xmath7 , and distance @xmath8 20 mpc .",
    "we have omitted known peculiar galaxies , cases of probable interaction ( based on inspection of the field on poss prints ) , members of the virgo cluster , and objects assigned class sa in the revised shapley ames catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rsac ) or the carnegie atlas @xcite .",
    "the final sample of 27 galaxies is listed in table 1 .",
    "all but six of our sample are contained in the rsac .",
    "most ( 24/27 ) are classified as either s0 , s0/sa , or as their barred counterparts .",
    "our final sample is free of the fir bias inherent in earlier s0 surveys , but still contains the biases of the nearby galaxies catalog .",
    "the most obvious of these are that optically small galaxies ( diameter @xmath8 1.5 @xmath9 -2 @xmath9 on the poss ) are excluded , and hi - poor systems are under - represented . nonetheless , we believe that table 1 constitutes the best sample now available for probing the cool ism in normal s0 galaxies within low - density environments .",
    "we report here on a single - antenna survey of co in these galaxies ; a complementary hi study is underway .",
    "in addition to its lack of fir bias , the present work departs in two important ways from published ones , which have been essentially flux - limited , and have usually looked only at the center of the galaxy ( see , however , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "first , we define a target sensitivity for each galaxy using the faber - gallagher relation for an assumed age of 10 gyr to compute an expected ism mass , @xmath10 .",
    "the goal is to provide a 5-sigma detection , or upper limit , of 0.02@xmath10 per pointing .",
    "since @xmath10 scales with the total blue luminosity , long integrations are needed for faint galaxies .",
    "secondly , we observe additional points ( along the major axis ) in the larger galaxies , even if no emission is detected at the center , as there are several early - type galaxies with molecular gas outside their centers @xcite .",
    "spectra of the j=2 - 1 and j=1 - 0 transitions of co in 20 galaxies were obtained in october 1998 with the iram 30 meter telescope .",
    "the nrao 12 meter telescope was used in november 1998 , january 2001 , and in february and april 2002 to observe the remainder of the sample in the j=1 - 0 transition , and also the galaxies having the largest angular sizes .",
    "the iram telescope main beam is assumed to have fwhm = 20.9@xmath11 and 10.4@xmath11 in the two transitions , whereas we take fwhm = 55@xmath11 for the 12 meter telescope at co ( j=1 - 0 ) .",
    "sufficiently sensitive co observations have been published for ngc 404 , 7013 , and 7077 ( wh ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we have not observed these galaxies .    the iram observations employed beam switching in azimuth with a throw of 240@xmath11 at 1 hz .",
    "dual polarization measurements were obtained simultaneously in both transitions , and directed both to filterbanks and autocorrelator backends .",
    "the filterbanks provided spectral windows 1332 km s@xmath12 and 666 km s@xmath12 wide for j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 , respectively , with resolutions of 2.60 km s@xmath12 and 1.30 km s@xmath12 wide , respectively .",
    "corresponding values for the autocorrelators were 1326 km s@xmath12 and 666 km s@xmath12 , and 3.25 km s@xmath12 and 1.63 km s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "telescope pointing and focus were checked about every 2 hours using a bright quasar or the planet mars . over the observing session , median corrections to the pointing model in azimuth and altitude were 0.9@xmath11 and 1.4@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "system temperatures were typically 300 - 400 k for j=1 - 0 and 600 - 700 k for j=2 - 1 .",
    "an initial 30 m spectrum was obtained at the center of the target .",
    "additional positions along the major axis were observed in 10 arcsecond steps , unless either no emission was seen or it appeared that the j=2 - 1 transition was at least as strong as j=1 - 0 . because previous observers have generally reported and i@xmath13 represent the integrated intensities ( area under the line ) of the two co transitions ] i@xmath14/i@xmath15 1 ( see below ) , the latter case was assumed to result from beam filling effects produced by a source smaller than the j=2 - 1 beam .",
    "the large beam of the 12 m telescope is useful in searching for extended gas in larger galaxies .",
    "beam switching in azimuth was also employed at that telescope , using a throw of 180@xmath11 .",
    "filterbanks collected data in both polarizations , providing windows 1330 km s@xmath12 wide and individual channel widths of 5.2 km s@xmath12 .",
    "system temperatures were usually 400 - 500 k. pointing and focus checks were made at roughly 2-hour intervals , using mars , saturn , jupiter , and several bright quasars .",
    "galaxies were observed on center and at 55 arcsecond steps along the major axis .",
    "the observations typically encompass @xmath0 0.5d@xmath16 and @xmath0 0.1d@xmath16 along the major axis , for the 12 m and 30 m telescopes , respectively , making the present survey unique for its extended spatial coverage .",
    "the class software package was used for data reduction .",
    "occasional bad channels were first removed in the individual raw scans , which represented 4 and 6 minute integrations for the 30 m and 12 m telescopes , respectively .",
    "all scans from a given pointing were then summed and hanning smoothed to typical resolutions of 13.0 and 20.8 km s@xmath12 for the 30 m and 12 m telescopes , respectively .",
    "other resolutions are noted in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "line windows were chosen as discussed below or in footnotes to tables 2 and 3 , and linear baselines fitted to the remainder of the spectrum .",
    "second order baselines were subtracted in a few cases , as noted in the tables .",
    "data were obtained on the main beam temperature scale from the 30 m telescope , and on the t@xmath17 scale at kitt peak .",
    "the latter was transformed to t@xmath18 using a corrected main beam efficiency of @xmath19 = 0.82 .    when emission was not clearly detected , we defined spectral - line windows for upper limit estimates using published kinematics of atomic gas ; otherwise , the optical rotation curve was employed . in only two cases ,",
    "ngc 4143 and ngc 4346 , were we unable to find any guiding observations ; for these galaxies we used windows 400 km s@xmath12 wide , centered on the optical velocity , as that represents the linewidth of a typical galaxy in our sample .",
    "the final summed spectrum at each center pointing is presented in figure 1 .",
    "integrated intensities on the t@xmath18 scale from 30 m and 12 m observations appear in tables 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "standard deviations , which serve as 1-sigma upper limits for non - detections , are calculated following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the rms noise in the binned spectrum , required for that procedure , is given in the table .",
    "observed positions are identified by specifying the offsets in arcseconds from the coordinates given in table 1 .",
    "excluding objects already known to contain co ( ngc 404 , 7013 , 7077 ) , we have detected 75 percent ( 18/24 ) of our sample with a formal confidence of 3@xmath20 or higher , 42 percent ( 10/24 ) with 5@xmath20 or higher .",
    "the detection rate for the entire sample is 78 percent . only the j=2 - 1 transition was detected in ngc 2787 , 3115 , 3384 , and 3990 ; although formally significant at 3.6@xmath20 and 4.8@xmath20 , respectively , the lines in ngc 3115 and ngc 3990 are complex and not convincing .",
    "emission ( at 4.9@xmath20 ) from ngc 4026 was detected only by the 12 m telescope at offset ( 2 , -55 ) . in the following summary",
    ", we include these galaxies among our detections ; better data are clearly needed for them .    within our admittedly small sample of 27 objects ,",
    "types s0 and s0/a are detected with similar frequency ( 11/15 and 6/8 , respectively ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , s0s with optical dust features and those without are also detected at about the same rate : 7/10 galaxies classified s0@xmath21 or s0@xmath22 ( or as their barred counterparts ) are detected , and 4/6 of those classified as s0@xmath23 , s0@xmath24 or s0@xmath25 .",
    "finally , sb0 galaxies are somewhat less likely to be detected ( 2/4 ) than s0 galaxies ( 8/10 ) , though high inclinations might obscure bars in several of the latter . in summary , except for a possible anti correlation with the presence of a bar , our sample does not show a relation between the gross optical properties of s0 galaxies and their detectability in co emission .",
    "the present observations can be used to estimate typical source sizes .",
    "the iram 30 m data show that i@xmath14/i@xmath261 in 7 galaxies where only the centre pointing was observed .",
    "even when the gas is quiescent , large intensity ratios can result when the source size is comparable to or smaller than the j=2 - 1 beam .",
    "assuming that to be the case , we derive a median linear size of 0.7 kpc for those 7 galaxies .",
    "an additional 7 galaxies have multiple - pointing 30 m data showing strong radial intensity declines which indicate that we have seen most of the total co emission .",
    "( this conclusion is less clear for ngc 4460 ; nonetheless , we include this galaxy in the discussion ) .",
    "we estimate the source size in those cases by summing the maximum separation between pointings with detections and adding the fwhm of the appropriate telescope beam , finding a median of 2.8 kpc , or 0.32d@xmath16 .",
    "therefore , our work reinforces the view ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that most of the molecular gas in s0 galaxies is near their centres",
    ".      line ratios ( i.e. ratios of integrated intensities in two transitions ) are used to investigate the physical state of molecular gas , though the interpretation is complicated because of the different ways the telescope beams couple to the source , and by the inevitable mixing of emission from dense cloud cores and more diffuse surrounding molecular gas .",
    "the few published multi - transition co studies of early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) report 0.5 @xmath27i@xmath14/i@xmath281 , which is assumed to indicate the gas is cool ( t@xmath2910k ) , optically thick and generally quiescent .    without maps of our sources we can not correct for different beam coupling .",
    "instead , we compare in figure 2 the 30 m telescope results with predictions which assume the same radiation temperature in both transitions , and that the source is either a point ( top line ) or that it uniformly fills both beams . the factor of 4 vertical difference between the lines is therefore the ratio of beam areas .",
    "the results shown in the figure are broadly consistent with previous studies .",
    "total h@xmath23 masses for all detected galaxies , or their upper limits , are presented in table 4 .",
    "whenever possible we use the relation given by @xcite with a conversion constant of 2.3 @xmath30 10@xmath31 @xmath32(k km s@xmath12)@xmath12 .",
    "uncertainties and upper limits are obtained by adding in quadrature the appropriate uncertainties from individual pointings .",
    "molecular masses for ngc 2787 , 3115 , 3384 , 3990 are estimated from the j=2 - 1 line intensities , assuming i@xmath14/i@xmath13=0.5 because , except perhaps for ngc 2787 , no j=1 - 0 emission is seen .",
    "we transform to our assumptions the published mass estimates for 6 galaxies observed by others and present them in table 5 .",
    "values obtained by ourselves from the 30 m and 12 m telescopes show pleasing consistency , which is generally present throughout the results contained in tables 2 - 4 .",
    "agreement with other studies is usually satisfactory , though the values reported by the nrao 12 m and nobeyama 45 m telescopes for ngc 7457 are the inverse of what one might expect from comparing the two beam sizes .",
    "another noteworthy disparity is the factor of 2 difference between 30 m observations towards the centre of ngc 5866 .",
    "most of the disagreement comes from the integrated intensities , which we believe are both on the t@xmath18 scale but which differ by a factor of 1.6 .",
    "inspection of table 2 shows that i@xmath13 changes by large amounts between positions separated by only @xmath00.5@xmath30fwhm or @xmath010@xmath11 near the centre of the galaxy , leading us to suspect that telescope pointing is the culprit , as previously suggested by @xcite for a different set of galaxies .    in table 6 and figure 3",
    "we present estimates of the total cool gas content of galaxies in our sample , obtained by combining molecular and atomic hydrogen masses from table 4 and from the literature .",
    "the table also shows the predicted mass of gas returned by stars according to the analytical expression of @xcite , i.e. the case k = 1.2 as discussed below .",
    "together , table 6 and figure 3 encapsulate the major results of our study .",
    "we now turn to the question of whether they support current ideas of the nature of lenticular galaxies .",
    "it has generally been thought that s0 galaxies formed most of their stars more or less monolithically 10 gyr or more ago , because of their typically red colours and late - type stellar spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "that view has been reinforced by the paucity of atomic hydrogen @xcite , relatively low levels of far - infrared emission @xcite , and by the almost complete absence of optical dust lanes @xcite and hii regions @xcite associated with star formation in spiral galaxies . in the monolithic paradigm ,",
    "a large cloud of primordial gas collapsed fairly rapidly to produce the galaxy , which has evolved passively since then .",
    "more rapid collapses produced elliptical galaxies , in which disks are insignificant ; less rapid collapses led to gas - rich spirals @xcite .",
    "but the simple monolithic picture has come under increasing pressure over the last decade , because the predicted bright , massive protogalaxies that would be the precursors of today s ellipticals have not been observed at any redshift or spectral band in the necessary numbers @xcite , although the nature of the unidentified galaxies seen through their sub - millimeter emission remains unclear @xcite .",
    "those deficiencies have stimulated investigations of the hierarchical formation idea , whereby galaxies are assembled from smaller pieces through a series of mergers @xcite .",
    "we initially hoped that our data would reveal evidence to prefer one path over the other .",
    "but as we show below , the most startling observational result remains difficult to understand within either picture .",
    "our most significant result is contained in figure 3 , which displays the total mass of atomic and molecular gas versus blue luminosity .",
    "the wide range in gas content among galaxies of similar luminosity is immediately evident .",
    "the most striking aspect , though , is the upper mass cutoff , which extends over the entire luminosity range spanned by our data , a factor of @xmath33 in luminosity and presumably in total mass . within that range , no galaxy contains more than about 10 percent of the gas predicted by recent estimates of stellar mass return ( see below ) , shown as a solid line in the figure .",
    "stated differently , even the most gas - rich s0s have lost 90 percent or more of all the gas ever returned by their stars .",
    "we find ourselves unable to use the data to distinguish clearly between the two evolutionary paths .",
    "as we outline below , with a judicious tuning of parameters it is possible to explain aspects of our results within either evolutionary scenario , but in both cases the tuning is contrived and the correspondence with the data incomplete .",
    "perhaps the difficulty arises from an assumption underlying our work - that all s0 galaxies have evolved along very similar paths .",
    "van den bergh ( 1990,1994 ) suggests that lenticulars comprise at least two distinct kinds of objects , one of these being the true s0s , i.e. galaxies forming the transition between ellipticals and spirals .",
    "although it is not yet possible to identify the pedigree of an individual galaxy , van den bergh suggests that true s0s are hiding among brighter , rounder galaxies , and that they tend to have @xcite sub - type i , i / s , or s. we have tried to test that suggestion by searching for some trend in optical properties among the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we have asked , for example , if the upper cutoff might be delineated by true s0s , but have not found any evidence to support the idea .",
    "while a wide range of gas content is certainly consistent with the view of s0s as a heterogeneous collection , the upper cutoff probably is not .    in the following sections we attempt to lay out the issues for the two galaxy formation paradigms , without providing a coherent explanation for our results .",
    "faber and gallagher realized that any isolated , passively evolving galaxy which converted almost all of its gas into stars early in its existence would over a hubble time build up an embarrassingly massive ism , unless most of the returned gas could be disposed of .",
    "the simple picture of stellar mass return used by fg has been extensively revised , most recently by @xcite , and @xcite , without qualitatively altering the original conclusion .",
    "we remind the reader of the model predictions that the mass of returned gas is given by m@xmath3 = kl@xmath4 , with all the relevant and variable physics being subsumed into the factor k.    the study by fg includes only gas return from stars with mass @xmath01m@xmath34 . when updated with more recent planetary nebula formation rates @xcite",
    ", it predicts that k = 0.07 , shown by a dashed line in figure 3 .",
    "the assumption underlying the fg approach is that gas returned to the ism during the first few gyr of the galaxy s existence was blown into intergalactic space by type ii supernovae .",
    "more complex descriptions of stellar gas return , which include contributions from a range of masses described by salpeter or miller - scalo initial mass functions , predict larger values of k , i.e. k@xmath01 .",
    "those descriptions have been incorporated in models of ism evolution which attempt to explain the x - ray emission from plasma within the deep potential wells of optically luminous e and s0 galaxies .",
    "the assumed masses are therefore considerably larger than appropriate for most of the galaxies in our sample . with that caveat in mind ,",
    "the studies most relevant for interpreting our data are brighenti & mathews s ( 1997 ) work on flattened ellipticals , and dercole & ciotti s ( 1998 ) investigation of lenticular galaxies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite take the initial state of the ism to be a hot , outflowing wind - the result of heating by type ii supernovae in the initial starburst .",
    "if all gas returned after the first @xmath35 gyr is retained , the analytic approximation of @xcite yields k = 1.2 for galaxies assumed to be 10 gyr old today , implying the presence of a massive ism .",
    "the amount of gas actually retained , however , is very sensitive to the depth and shape of the gravitational potential , and also to the assumed rate of energy input from type ia supernovae . in all cases ,",
    "though , the results are qualitatively consistent with our observations : most of the gas ever returned to the ism is lost , much of it in the first 1 gyr of the galaxy s life .    models of more massive galaxies show the development of central cooling flows , also termed decoupled inflows , which accumulate 10@xmath36m@xmath34 of cool gas .",
    "no attempt has yet been made to explore the fate of the cooling gas .",
    "the amount of cool gas expected at the present time depends on when the initial outflow reverses , i.e. on the assumed sn ia rate for a given gravitational potential .",
    "uncertainty in the supernova rate is a major impediment to understanding what happens to the gas , but using rates consistent with recent work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the models of dercole & ciotti predict that the most massive galaxies in the present sample , are likely to have developed inflows after several gyr .",
    "models are not yet available of flattened galaxies with m@xmath37m@xmath34 , which is more typical of our sample , but the trends make it appear that , due to their low masses , few of our galaxies can have developed inflows , so they should be essentially free of cool gas . we therefore anticipate that models with galaxy masses more appropriate to our sample will predict that effectively no gas will be retained in the smaller galaxies .",
    "what is particularly striking , in the light of that expectation , is that we see molecular gas even in some of the lowest - mass galaxies in our sample .",
    "figure 3 reveals that those galaxies have gas deficiencies equal to ( and in some cases much less than ) the deficiencies of the most massive galaxies we have observed - objects roughly 100 times more massive . varying the energy equilibrium of the gas(e.g .",
    "the sn ia rate ) can explain the range of gas mass at any particular blue luminosity .",
    "but it seems excessively contrived to explain the upper cutoff by such parameter adjustments .",
    "the optical colours and spectra of s0 disks are consistent with them being a few gyr younger than the accompanying bulges @xcite , although most observations refer to s0s in clusters .",
    "relatively young disks can be readily explained by one of the central pillars of the hierarchical paradigm : spheroids formed in major mergers can later acquire disk components from surrounding gas reservoirs ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ; steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) . while the evolution of the morphology and gas - content of such disks has not been clarified by current hierarchical studies , the idea of gas infall over extended periods seems to offer no ready explanation for the upper cutoff in figure 3 .",
    "the fundamental reason why hierarchical models can not yet address our results is that the fate of the gas in a _",
    "single _ merger can not be predicted with confidence .",
    "interactions between galaxies bring in new gas .",
    "they also dispose of it in star formation , by blasting it into intergalactic space through type ii supernovae , or by tidal stripping .",
    "the outcome therefore depends on many parameters , including the structure of the colliding galaxies , the encounter geometry , the prescription for star formation , and the effectiveness of stellar feedback(e.g .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is again conceivable that judicious parameter tuning could explain the observed range of gas deficiency .",
    "we doubt the same is true for the upper cutoff .",
    "we report a survey of molecular gas in a sample of 27 normal , field s0 galaxies within 20 mpc .",
    "the present survey differs from earlier ones in that it is volume - limited rather than iras flux - limited , looks for gas outside the centres of the galaxies , and has sensitivity limits based on fundamental considerations of stellar evolution - that aging stars return gas to the interstellar medium .",
    "our results provide a unique basis for understanding the properties , origin , and fate of dense gas in normal s0 galaxies residing outside of rich clusters .",
    "we confirm earlier studies of different samples , finding that molecular gas is common in s0 galaxies ; 78 percent of our sample is detected in either the j=1 - 0 or j=2 - 1 transition of co. the gas is centrally located in regions with sizes up to 1 - 3 kpc ; we do not find significant amounts of gas at larger distances .",
    "we have combined observations with published hi data to estimate the total mass of cold gas in each galaxy .",
    "the results of that exercise are presented in figure 3 , which contains two important results : first , a wide range of gas content is present at a fixed optical luminosity .",
    "second , an upper cutoff in gas content is present across the entire luminosity range spanned by our sample : -17 @xmath38m@xmath39 - 21 .",
    "those findings , but especially the second , present a significant challenge for our ideas of how s0 galaxies have evolved .",
    "if s0s formed during a single monolithic collapse early in the history of the universe , and have subsequently evolved as _ closed systems _",
    ", then all now contain much less gas than expected from stellar mass loss ; figure 3 indicates that 10@xmath4010@xmath12 .",
    "that fact alone , though , does not necessarily present a serious problem for models of ism evolution based on the monolithic formation paradigm .",
    "the expected amount of cool gas is extremely sensitive to poorly known quantities such as the assumed rate of type ia supernovae , and the shape and depth of the gravitational potential well , so that a wide range of gas content can be explained .",
    "it is very hard to understand , however , how those poorly known factors , and perhaps others , could conspire to produce the upper cutoff of gas content so clearly evident in figure 3 ..    within the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation , s0 bulges may have formed through major mergers , followed by the slow accretion of surrounding gas to form their disks .",
    "although that idea can explain optical observations which imply relatively young ages for s0 disks , it might be difficult to understand how the upper cutoff would arise from an extended period of gas accretion .    in summary ,",
    "our study poses broad and significant questions for the two popular galaxy formation paradigms , and it is not yet clear which , if either , will be more successful at answering them",
