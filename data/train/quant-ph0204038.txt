    "when the term `` quantum information '' was first coined , it would have been hard to predict how thorough and fruitful the analogy between quantum mechanics and classical information theory would ultimately prove to be .",
    "the general approach , characterized by the treatment of quantum states as resources to be manipulated , has yielded a promising collection of applications , ranging from unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols @xcite to quantum algorithms @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the analogy , which was initially unavoidably vague , has gradually been filled in by a diverse variety of rigorous theorems describing achievable limits to the manipulation of quantum states , such as the characterization of the classical information capacity of quantum sources @xcite , of the optimal strategies for entanglement concentration and dilution @xcite and many more .",
    "one of the pivotal results of the emerging theory is the quantum source coding theorem @xcite , demonstrating that for the task of compressing quantum states , the von neumann entropy plays a role directly analogous to the shannon entropy of classical information theory .",
    "indeed , the quantum theorem subsumes the classical one as the special case in which all the quantum states to be compressed are mutually orthogonal .    a quantum source ( or ensemble )",
    "@xmath4 is defined by a set of pure quantum signal ( or `` letter '' ) states @xmath5 with given prior probabilities @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "below for precise definitions of these and other terms used in the introduction ) . in this paper",
    "we will study the so  called _ visible _ compression of @xmath7 .",
    "more specifically , we wish to characterize the minimal resources per signal that are necessary and sufficient to represent arbitrarily long strings of signals with arbitrarily high fidelity , when the compressor is given the identity of the input state sequence as _ classical _ information ( as the sequence of labels @xmath8 rather than the quantum states @xmath9 themselves , for example ) . according to the quantum source coding theorem",
    "the optimal _ quantum _ rate in this scenario is the von neumann entropy @xmath1 qubits per signal .",
    "we will develop a refinement of this theorem in which the states are coded into classical and quantum bits which are quantified _",
    "separately_. this leads to a trade  off curve @xmath2 where @xmath2 qubits per signal is the optimal quantum rate that suffices for a given classical rate @xmath3 bits per signal .",
    "the quantum source coding theorem implies that @xmath10 and evidently we also have @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the shannon entropy of the prior distribution of the source .",
    "( by standard classical compression , the compressor can represent the full information of the input sequence in @xmath12 classical bits per signal . )",
    "thus the trade  off curve extends between the limits @xmath13 .",
    "there are various reasons why we might wish to maintain a separation between classical and quantum resources in an encoding @xcite . on a purely practical level it seems to be far easier to manufacture classical storage and communication devices than it is to make quantum ones .",
    "but perhaps the primary reason is conceptual : classical and quantum information have quite different fundamental characters , with classical information exhibiting special properties not shared by quantum information in general . for example",
    "classical information is robust compared to quantum information  it may be readily stabilized and corrected by repeated measurement that would destroy quantum information . also , unlike quantum information",
    ", it may be cloned or copied . these and other singular properties indicate that for many purposes it may be useful to regard classical information as a separate resource , distinct from quantum information .",
    "classical information is sometimes formally regarded as a special case of quantum information _ viz . _ the quantum information of a fixed set of orthogonal states . while this characterization is useful for formal analyses , it is unsatisfactory conceptually because it relies on the essentially non - physical infinite precision of orthogonality .",
    "it is , therefore , perhaps better to view classical information as a separate resource .",
    "exploring the trade  off possibilities between the two resources will lead to a better understanding of the interrelation of these concepts and the nature of quantum information itself .",
    "if bits can always be represented as qubits ( and indeed , by holevo s information bound  @xcite , at least one qubit per bit is necessary and sufficient ) , what are the limitations on representing qubits as bits ? under what conditions is it possible at all ?",
    "if there is a penalty to be paid , how large is it ? in this paper we will give answers to these questions .",
    "our main result is a simple characterization of the trade ",
    "off function @xmath2 which may be paraphrased as follows",
    ". given the ensemble @xmath14 comprising @xmath15 states @xmath5 we consider decompositions of @xmath7 into at most @xmath16 ensembles @xmath17 with associated probabilities @xmath18 i.e. the ensembles @xmath19 have the same states as @xmath7 and their union @xmath20 reproduces @xmath7 .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition @xmath21 on the chosen probabilities @xmath18 and @xmath22 defining the decomposition .",
    "let @xmath23 be the average von neumann entropy of any such decomposition and let @xmath24 be the classical mutual information of the joint distribution @xmath25 . for any @xmath3 let @xmath26 be the least average von neumann entropy over all decompositions that have @xmath27 .",
    "then we will prove that the trade ",
    "off function is given by @xmath28 .",
    "the prescription of a decomposition @xmath29 may be equivalently given in terms of a visible encoding map @xmath30 of the states of @xmath7 : @xmath31 here @xmath32 are chosen freely subject only to the condition that @xmath27 and the previous probability distributions are constructed as @xmath33 and @xmath34 . under this map , @xmath35",
    "is encoded into a quantum register , simply containing the state @xmath5 itself , and a classical register , containing a classical mixture of @xmath36 values .",
    "note that this is a _ single _ signal encoding with _ perfect _ fidelity since the state @xmath5 may be regained perfectly from the encoded version by simply discarding the classical register .",
    "hence our result characterizes optimal classical and quantum resources in compression , in terms of very simple single - signal perfect - fidelity encodings , despite the fact that compression is defined asymptotically in terms of arbitrarily long signal strings and fidelities merely _ tending _ to 1 .",
    "this is a remarkable and unexpected simplification  even in classical information theory it is by no means the rule that coding problems have solutions that do _ not _ involve asymptotics ( despite a few well known examples such as shannon s source and channel coding theorems @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is even more tenuous in quantum information theory , which seems to be plagued by further non  additivity ( or unresolved additivity questions ) for some of its basic quantities so that , at the present stage , many basic constructions require a limit over optimization problems of exponentially growing size .    using our formula",
    "we will give a thorough discussion of further properties of the trade  off curve including a generalization to group covariant sources and to sources with infinitely many ( continuously parameterized ) states .",
    "we show that our result also leads to a number of corollaries characterizing the trade  off between information gain and state disturbance for quantum sources ( yielding the results of  @xcite on blind compression as a corollary ) , and we indicate how our techniques for characterizing @xmath2 provide a solution to the so - called remote state preparation problem as well .",
    "finally we develop a probability  free version of our main result which may be interpreted as an answer to the intuitive question : `` how many classical bits does a qubit cost ? '' this may also be interpreted as a kind of dual to holevo s theorem , insofar as the latter characterizes the qubit cost of coding classical information into qubits .",
    "the presentation of these results is organized as follows . at the top level ,",
    "the paper is divided broadly into two parts .",
    "part i , comprising sections 2 through 8 , sets up a precise formulation of the basic definitions and the trade  off problem and gives the proof of the main theorem characterizing @xmath2 , as well as a discussion of some of its important basic properties .",
    "part ii , comprising sections 9 and 10 , then goes on to provide some further generalizations of the main result . in more detail , the contents of the various sections are as follows .    in section",
    "[ sec : compression ] , we will define the notions of blind and visible compression , the essential difference being that in the blind setting the encoder is given the actual quantum states , while in the visible setting the encoder is given the names of the quantum states as classical data .",
    "we then extend these definitions to quantum  classical trade  off coding and introduce the trade ",
    "off function @xmath2 .",
    "in section [ sec : lowerbound ] we will prove a lower bound to the trade  off curve in terms of the simple single  letter formula of the ensemble decomposition construction paraphrased above . in section [ sec : achieve ] we will , in turn , show that the lower bound is achievable so that the trade  off curve is identical to the single ",
    "letter formula .",

    "off function . in section [ sec : avs ] we extend our results to a different asymptotic setting , known as the arbitrarily varying source ( avs ) , in which there is no ( or only limited ) knowledge of the prior probability distribution of the states to be compressed .",
    "this provides a probability - free generalization of our main result . in section [ sec : infodisturb ] we show that our main result can be reinterpreted to provide statements about the trade  off between information gain and state disturbance for blind sources of quantum states ( in particular entailing a new proof of the main result of @xcite ) .",
    "finally for part i , in section [ sec : rsp ] we indicate how our techniques  developed to study @xmath2  can also be used to characterize the trade  off curve for the coding problem of remote state preparation posed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "part ii treats two significant further issues . in section [ sec : symmetry ]",
    "we show how to apply our results in the setting of group covariant ensembles , which leads to considerable further elegant simplifications .",
    "section [ sec : infinitesource ] is devoted to the technicalities of generalizing our main result to sources with infinitely many ( continuously parameterized ) states .",
    "finally , in an appendix , we collect proofs of various auxiliary propositions that have been quoted in the body of the paper .",
    "+    * *    part i : + characterizing the trade  off curve",
    "we begin by introducing a number of definitions that are required to give a precise statement of the variations of quantum source coding that we will be considering in this paper .",
    "we will denote an ensemble of quantum states @xmath37 with prior probabilities @xmath6 as @xmath38 . in turn , we will write @xmath39 for the von neumann entropy of the average state of the ensemble : @xmath40 .",
    "( throughout this paper @xmath41 and @xmath42 will denote the logarithm and exponential functions _ to base @xmath43_. ) starting from an ensemble @xmath7 , we can consider the quantum source producing quantum states that are sequentially drawn independently from @xmath7 .",
    "such a source corresponds to a sequence of ensembles @xmath44 , where @xmath45 this sequence will be referred to as an independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "source and the states of @xmath46 are called blocks of length @xmath47 from @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we will focus on sources of pure quantum states @xmath5 , often making use of the notation @xmath48 .",
    "the measure that we will use to determine whether two quantum states are close is the fidelity @xmath49 . for two mixed states",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath49 is given by the formula @xmath52 ( note that some authors use the name `` fidelity '' to refer to the square - root of this quantity . )",
    "if @xmath53 is a pure state then the fidelity has a particularly simple form : @xmath54 finally , we will use the notation @xmath55 to denote the hilbert space of dimension @xmath56 and @xmath57 to denote the set of all mixed states on @xmath55 .",
    "likewise , @xmath58 will refer to the @xmath47-fold tensor product of @xmath55 and , in a slight abuse of notation , @xmath59 will refer to the set of density operators on @xmath58 .",
    "we are now ready to introduce the definition of _ blind _ quantum compression .",
    "[ cdefn : quantumencdec ] a _ blind coding scheme _ for blocks of length @xmath47 , to @xmath3 qubits per signal and",
    "fidelity @xmath60 comprises the following ingredients :    1 .   a completely positive , trace - preserving ( cptp ) encoding map @xmath61 .",

    "the definition of visible compression is the same except that the ( cptp ) restrictions on the encoding map @xmath66 are relaxed ; for visible compression @xmath66 can be an arbitrary association of input states to output states .",
    "equivalently , @xmath66 is a mapping from the _ names _ of the input states to output states .",
    "thus , we write @xmath67 .",
    "note that blind and visible compression schemes differ only in the set of encoding maps that are permitted . for blind ( respectively visible ) compression , the input states are given as quantum ( respectively classical ) information . in both cases",
    "the decoding must be cptp . in this language ,",
    "the central result on the compression of quantum information can be expressed as :    [ thm : quantumsourcecoding ] a source @xmath7 of pure quantum states can be compressed to @xmath68 qubits per signal if and only if @xmath69 . the result holds for both blind and visible compression .",
    "it is interesting to study a refinement of quantum source coding in which the states are coded into classical and quantum resources which are quantified separately . because of restrictions on the manipulation of quantum states such as the no  cloning theorem @xcite",
    ", blind compression is typically weaker than visible . in refs . @xcite and @xcite , for example",
    ", it was shown that in blind compression it is typically impossible to make use of classical storage .",
    "the same is not true in the visible setting , where it is possible to trade classical storage for quantum . in this paper",
    "we study this trade ",
    "off for _ visible _ compression but , before we begin , we need to recall some basic definitions introduced in ref .",

    "there is usually no trade  off to be made : generically , @xmath83 , regardless of the size of @xmath3 .",
    "the reason is essentially that making effective use of the classical register amounts to extracting classical information from a quantum system in a reversible fashion , which is impossible unless the quantum states of interest obey some orthogonality condition .",
    "the more interesting case , therefore , is to study the structure of the trade  off curve for visible encodings .",
    "as it turns out , our technique will yield the older results for blind compression as a corollary .",

    "some properties of the curve @xmath2 are immediate .",
    "for example , the endpoints of the curve are easily found . if @xmath85 then the compression must be fully quantum mechanical and the quantum source coding theorem  [ thm : quantumsourcecoding ] applies : @xmath10 .",

    "similarly , for @xmath87 we have @xmath88 , by shannon s classical source coding theorem .",

    "we will then prove that nothing was lost by making this shift  we will show that the resulting lower bound to @xmath2 is actually achievable .",

    "this need not always be true .",
    "= 3.6 in    in general , more complicated ensembles with internal structure will have trade  off curves reflecting that structure .",

    "i.e. , it has average fidelity @xmath371 on the ensemble . by the proposition it has cbit rate @xmath702 and qubit rate @xmath703 as @xmath704 .",

    "off function as @xmath415 , we obtain the expected result :    [ thm : infinite : avs ] @xmath707 , with @xmath708 where @xmath709 is the convex hull of @xmath412 .",

    "we start by choosing an @xmath672 and a partition @xmath637 according to proposition  [ prop : infinite : coding ] .",
    "every distribution @xmath267 in @xmath412 gives rise to a distribution @xmath711 , and we denote @xmath712 note that , because the map @xmath713 is affine linear , we get @xmath714 .",
    "now for @xmath234 we introduce again the set @xmath715 and it is easy to see ( compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : z : typical : probability ] ) ) that @xmath716 carries @xmath717 of the probability of every @xmath718 . on the other hand , because @xmath719 is a union of type classes , we can find `` few '' @xmath720 , @xmath721 such that the corresponding @xmath722 cover @xmath719 .",
    "the coding is very simple : on seeing a state @xmath723 the encoder finds the index @xmath113 of the piece @xmath724 in the partition @xmath725 such that @xmath699 , and the type of @xmath113 . if @xmath439 , he looks up @xmath440 such that @xmath726 and uses the coding scheme of proposition  [ prop : infinite : coding ] for @xmath727 .",
    "( note that he needs not even send the type of @xmath113 as that is part of the protocol of proposition  [ prop : infinite : coding ] . )",
    "choosing @xmath271 large enough this recipe gives a code with high fidelity for every @xmath718 ; by construction and proposition  [ prop : infinite : coding ] , it has rates of @xmath369 cbits and @xmath728 qubits , with a function @xmath235 that tends to @xmath729 as @xmath730 .    to end this discussion , we would like to point out that a similar treatment of remote state preparation can be done : in fact , as we discussed in section  [ sec : rsp ] , we always use the `` @xmath108 ebit @xmath731 @xmath108 cbit per qubit '' technique ( theorem  [ thm:1and1per1 ] ) on top of an efficient trade  off coding . to do this for an infinite ensemble one only has to understand that the bound of theorem  [ thm:1and1per1 ] is strong enough to allow approximation of the set of projected ( compressed ) product states @xmath732 , at negligible additional classical cost .",
    "our main result is a simple formula for the trade  off between quantum and classical resources in visible compression .",
    "the formula expresses the trade  off curve @xmath2 in terms of a single ",
    "letter optimization over conditional probability distributions of bounded size .",
    "this unexpectedly simple resolution places optimal trade  off coding into a small but growing class of problems in quantum information theory whose answers are not only known in principle but can be calculated in practice .",
    "( another notable recent addition is the entanglement  assisted capacity of a quantum channel @xcite . )    at a conceptual level , for any given ensemble @xmath7 of quantum states , @xmath2 can be thought of as a quantitative description of how `` classical '' the ensemble is .",
    "any deviation from classicality is captured in the trade  off curve in the form of inefficiency of the classical storage .",
    "the amount of information that can be extracted from many copies of @xmath7 while causing negligible disturbance , for example , can be read directly off the curve by identifying the point at which classical resources begin to become inefficient as compared to quantum .",
    "much more subtle indicators of classicality are also available in @xmath2 , however .",
    "we saw , for instance , that for the parameterized bb84 ensemble , @xmath2 had a kink at the point corresponding to partitioning the ensemble into nearly orthogonal subensembles .    going beyond the compression of ensembles , we saw that it is possible to formulate a version of our main result in the setting of arbitrarily varying sources , corresponding to the situation in which the encoder and decoder have only partial or even no knowledge of the distribution of input states . despite this handicap , compression is frequently still possible and we once again find that the trade  off curve can be calculated via a tractable optimization problem . for ensembles with symmetry , the problem can even often be reduced to calculating @xmath2 for one particular ensemble .",
    "thus , for any given set of pure states , including the whole manifold of states on a given hilbert space , these tools allow us to calculate the rate of exchange from qubit storage to classical storage .",
    "the answer is given , of course , not in terms of a single number but as the trade  off curve .",
    "( like in any market , the going rate depends on supply . )",
    "our view that @xmath2 encodes the balance of quantum and classical information in a given ensemble or set of states is further bolstered by the role it was found to play in optimal remote state preparation . in this context , the minimal amount of classical communication required for any given rate of entanglement consumption can , once again , be read directly off the quantum  classical trade  off curve .",
    "that the comparatively exotic process of remote state preparation should reduce , via theorem [ thm:1and1per1 ] , to visible compression is a tremendous simplification .",
    "of course , while we have seen that the results of this paper resolve some basic questions about trading different types of resources in quantum information , most related questions remain open . to begin , it is possible to trade entanglement , quantum communication and classical communication all together in a generalized type of remote state preparation .",
    "since our results here describe the two extremes when first entanglement and then quantum communication are not permitted , it seems likely that similar techniques could resolve the full trade  off `` surface '' .",
    "more ambitiously , one could define channel capacities for noisy quantum channels that interpolate between the fully quantum and classical capacities by studying the usefulness of a channel for simultaneously sending quantum and classical information .",
    "the problem analogous to the trade  off question studied here would be to determine the achievable _ region _ of quantum  classical rate pairs .",
    "unfortunately , given that neither the fully classical nor fully quantum extremes are fully understood , it may be a long time before we develop tools capable of analyzing that problem",
    ".    therefore , to end , we offer two related open problems that are perhaps closer to the realm of the tractable .",
    "first , it would be useful to have a set of rules for extracting qualitative features of the trade  off curve , such as the location of any kinks and perhaps more detailed differentiability properties , from the structure of the input states ( or ensemble ) .",
    "second , it would be an interesting challenge to apply the observations of section [ sec : symmetry ] on symmetry to the explicit calculation of the trade  off curve for particular examples and , more generally , to find other approaches to simplifying these calculations .",

    "now we argue structurally : the set @xmath749 is convex ( as a subset of an infinite dimensional probability simplex with additional linear inequality constraints ) , and the aim function is linear .",
    "hence the infimum is an infimum over the extreme points of @xmath749 , which are , by caratheodory s theorem , distributions @xmath618 with support at most @xmath750 , the number of inequalities that define @xmath751 , see e.g.  @xcite . in section  [ sec : symmetry ]",
    "proposition [ prop : small : classical : part ] we will give a detailed exposition of a more general form of this result .      the `` @xmath752 '' inequality follows directly by forming the tensor product of two encodings for @xmath753 and @xmath754 with classical rates @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively . + the `` @xmath365 '' inequality is shown by choosing an encoding for the tensor product with classical rate @xmath3 and then using the chain rule several times for subdivisions @xmath755 and @xmath756 as follows .",
    "first observe that @xmath757 and then @xmath758 the second last line is seen as follows : in the line above it , the two mutual informations are conditional on @xmath759 , so they both can be written as averages over the values of @xmath759 .",
    "hence the inequality follows by the convexity of @xmath195 in @xmath3",
    ".          we will first prove the proposition for irreducible @xmath7 . using a trick introduced by holevo @xcite",
    ", we can reduce the problem further to the case of a two  state ensemble : for an ensemble @xmath764 of states ( we assume that all @xmath765 ) and two specific indices @xmath105 and @xmath491 , define a new index @xmath766 ( of course , in the case we have in mind , the @xmath767 are the pure states from the ensemble @xmath7 , and the @xmath625 are commuting mixed states representing the classical information . )",
    "then consider the multipartite state @xmath768 the definition of @xmath769 and the familiar chain rule imply @xmath770 note that the second term is an average over the values of @xmath769 of holevo quantities for the corresponding reduced ensembles .",
    "therefore , it has only one nonzero contribution , which is @xmath771 then , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : chain ] ) and monotonicity of @xmath125 under partial trace repeatedly : @xmath772 assuming that the first and the last holevo quantity have the same value , we must have equality in the third line , implying @xmath773 with @xmath774 . then , applying the general formula @xmath775 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : central1 ] ) , with @xmath776 and @xmath135 the relative entropy function , and using lindblad monotonicity once more yields @xmath777 ( and likewise for @xmath491 . )    with this we are almost done : invoking a result of ohya and petz ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , theorem 9.12 ) we conclude that there exists a cptp map @xmath3 such that @xmath778 from which it follows by linearity that @xmath779 since cptp maps ( @xmath3 and @xmath780 ) can not decrease fidelity we thus must have @xmath781 or @xmath782 .    in the particular case that the initial ensemble is irreducible we conclude that all @xmath625 must be equal , or else the partial trace over @xmath72 strictly decreases the holevo quantity .",
    "if the ensemble @xmath7 is not irreducible , a simple variation on the previous argument shows that , for each of the irreducible subensembles @xmath485 , @xmath783 must be equal to @xmath125 of the corresponding subensemble @xmath784 of @xmath454 . applying our conclusions to these subensembles finishes the proof of the proposition .",
    "as explained earlier in the proof of proposition [ prop3.two ] , any classical encoding map can be viewed as a probability distribution @xmath618 on the set @xmath785 of probability distributions on @xmath269 with barycenter @xmath313 : @xmath786 .",
    "covariance of the encoding means invariance of @xmath618 under the natural action of @xmath520 on @xmath785 , i.e. , @xmath787 .",
    "hence for each distribution @xmath313 in the support of @xmath618 we must have all the @xmath788 in the support as well . on the other hand",
    ", we need far less conditions to obey , as it will turn out :    assume that the covariant encoding is given by the distributions @xmath789 now choose representatives @xmath790 of the orbits , and observe that ( by @xmath520invariance ) @xmath791 if and only if @xmath792 similarly , @xmath367 if and only if @xmath793 and finally , our aim function reads @xmath794    now consider the affine linear map from @xmath785 to @xmath795 defined by @xmath796 note that the image of this map is in a certain @xmath440dimensional subspace because , if @xmath797 of the conditions  ( [ eq : sum : to : p ] ) are satisfied then the @xmath798 is also , automatically . eqs .
