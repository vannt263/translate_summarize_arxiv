    "todays astrometry necessitates theoretical predictions of light - deflection by massive bodies on microarcsecond ( @xmath3 ) level , e.g. astrometric missions sim ( nasa ) or gaia ( esa ) . in principle , an astrometric precision on microarcsecond level can be achieved by numerical integration of geodesic equation of light - propagation . on the other side ,",
    "modern astrometric missions like gaia determine the positions and proper motions of approximately one billion objects , each of which is observed about one hundred times .",
    "the data reduction of such huge amount of observations implies the need of analytical solutions , because the numerical investigation of geodesic equation is by far too time - consuming .",
    "the metric of a massive body can be expanded in terms of multipoles , i.e. monopole term , quadrupole term and higher multipoles @xcite .",
    "usually , the largest contributions of light - deflection originates from the spherically symmetric part ( schwarzschild ) of the massive body under consideration .",
    "the exact analytical solution of light - propagation in schwarzschild metric @xcite inherits elliptic integrals , but their evaluation becomes comparable with the time effort needed for a numerical integration of geodesic equation .",
    "thus , approximative analytical solutions valid on microarcsecond level of accuracy are indispensible for a highly time - efficient data reduction .    in the same way",
    ", exact lens equations of light - deflection have been obtained in @xcite . however , such exact relations are also given in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "therefore , approximations of these exact solutions are also needed for a time - efficient data reduction .",
    "an excellent overview of such approximative lens equations has recently been presented in @xcite .",
    "basically , two essential approximative approaches are known in order to determine the light - deflection in weak gravitational fields :    the first one is the standard parameterized post - newtonian approach ( ppn ) @xcite which is of the order @xmath4 . during the last decades , it has been the common understanding that the higher order terms @xmath5 are negligible even on microarcsecond level , except for observations in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "however , recent investigations @xcite have revealed that the post - post - newtonian approximation @xcite , which is of the order @xmath5 , is needed for such high accuracy .",
    "both approximations are applicable for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 being the impact parameter of the unperturbed light ray .",
    "the second one is the standard weak - field approximative lens equation , which is usually called the classical lens equation , see eq .",
    "( 67 ) in @xcite of eq .",
    "( 24 ) in @xcite .",
    "one decisive advantage of classical lens equation is its validity for arbitrarily small values of impact parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the classical lens equation is valid for astrometrical configurations where source and observer are far ernough from the lens , especially in case of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the three - vectors from the center of the massive body to the source and observer , respectively , and @xmath14 is the unit vector from the source to the observer .",
    "however , the classical lens equation is not applicable for determine the light - deflection of moons of giant planets in the solar system , because astrometrical configurations with @xmath15 are possible .",
    "moreover , there are astrometric configurations where neither the standard post - newtonian approach nor the classical lens equation are applicable , for instance binary systems . in order to investigate the light - deflection in such systems",
    "a link between these both approaches is needed .",
    "such a link can be provided by a generalized lens equation which , in the appropriate limits , coincides with standard post - newtonian approach and classical lens equation .",
    "accordingly , the aim of our investigation is an analytical expression for the generalized lens equation having a form very similar to the classical lens equation .",
    "we formulate the following conditions under which our generalized lens equation should be applicable :    1 .",
    "@xmath16 valid for @xmath17 , 2 .",
    "@xmath18 valid for @xmath19 , 3 .",
    "@xmath20 valid for @xmath21 .",
    "these conditions imply that the light - path is always far enough from the lens , thus inherit weak gravitational fields , i.e. small light deflection angles . in order to control the numerical accuracy ,",
    "the generalized lens equation is compared with the numerical solution of exact geodesic equation in the schwarzschild metric ( throughout the paper , we work in harmonic gauge ) : @xmath22    here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath25 is the mass of the light - deflecting body , @xmath26 is newtonian constant of gravitation and @xmath27 is the speed of light .",
    "latin indices take values @xmath28 , and the euclidean metric @xmath29 for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "let us consider the trajectory of a light - signal in post - newtonian schwarzschild metric : @xmath42    here , @xmath43 is the parameter of the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism , which characterizes possible deviation of the physical reality from general relativity theory where @xmath44 .",
    "the light - ray is being emitted at a position @xmath12 at time moment @xmath45 and received at position @xmath13 at a time moment @xmath46 , see figure  [ fig : lensc ] .",
    "light propagation is governed by the geodesic equation , in post - newtonian order given by @xmath47    the unit tangent vector at the point of observation is @xmath48 , and the unit tangent vector @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and the absolute value is @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , we define the unit tangent vector at remote past : @xmath52 .    up to post - newtonian order ,",
    "the differential equation ( [ geodesic - post - newtonian ] ) can be solved analytically .",

    "one problem of post - newtonian solution ( [ standard_25_a ] ) or ( [ standard_25_b ] ) is , that one can only state that the neglected terms are of order @xmath5 , but their magnitude remains unclear . in order to make a statement about the upper magnitude of the higher order terms one needs to consider the geodesic equation in post - post - newtonian approximation .",
    "now we will consider the trajectory of a light - signal in post - post - newtonian schwarzschild metric : @xmath65    the geodesic equation of light - propagation in post - post - newtonian approximation is given by @xcite @xmath66    the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath43 and @xmath68 characterize possible deviation of physical reality from general relativity theory ( in general relativity @xmath69 ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ geodesic - post - post - newtonian ] ) and the transformation between the unit vectors @xmath53 and @xmath14 in post - post - newtonian order has been given in @xcite , cf .",

    "therefore , the classical lens equation is not applicable for extreme configurations like binary systems or light deflection of moons at their giant planets of solar system .",
    "it can easily be shown that the classical lens equation ( [ lens_25 ] ) follows straightforward from the generalized lens equation ( [ simplest_form_25 ] ) .",

    "obviously , in the limit @xmath110 the expression ( [ limit_b_0 ] ) yields zero as it has to be because in this limit the distance between source and observer vanishes , that means no light deflection .",
