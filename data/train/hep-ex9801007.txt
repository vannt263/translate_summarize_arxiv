    "figure  [ allexp ] demonstrates the complementarity of different experimental results with respect to the mixing angles .",
    "the shaded area represents the 90% likelihood regions obtained by lsnd @xcite in favour of  oscillations .",
    "the other curves show limits from karmen (  appearance search ,  and from this  disappearance search ) , bnl e776 (  appearance @xcite ) and fnal e531 (  appearance @xcite ) . for this value of",
    ", the  exclusion curve from bnl e776 just covers the allowed region by lsnd  bnl e776 with its  limit does not cover the whole lsnd region in ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) any more . ] with the karmen  sensitivity now substantially improved following an experimental upgrade ( see section [ conclu ] ) .",
    "however , the complementary searches of karmen and fnal e531  clearly exclude regions of the lsnd evidence with @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively . again",
    ", the necessity of investigating all oscillation channels to aim for a consistent description of neutrino mixing becomes evident .",
    "the karmen experiment has found no positive evidence for @xmath4 oscillations in the investigated channels  and  through disappearance of .",
    "charged current reactions induced by  were analyzed by three different methods investigating the absolute number of events , the ratio of cc to nc events and the spectral shape of energy @xmath18 and target distance @xmath17 .",
    "the sensitivity of the  search is limited by the accuracy of the theoretical cross section of  and the @xmath4 flux calculation in the first evaluation , and by the relatively small statistics of 458 events in the case of the shape analysis .",
    "the experimental parameter @xmath154 can be measured with high accuracy on an event basis and differs significantly compared to other  disappearance searches at reactors or  appearance searches at accelerators . in the maximum likelihood analysis , the 3 flavor approach assures fully independent treatment of  and  mixing as free parameters .",
    "the sensitivity of karmen is competitive with existing limits from oscillation searches at reactors and improves limits from accelerator experiments for  for @xmath155 .    in 1996 ,",
    "the karmen detector system was improved by an additional veto counter system consisting of 300m@xmath41 of plastic scintillator modules placed within the massive iron shielding of the central detector .",
    "this new veto system will reduce significantly cosmic induced background for the oscillation search , especially in the appearance channel  @xcite . in the ongoing measuring period we expect again about 400 induced cc sequences from",
    ". therefore , the statistical significance of this  investigation will slightly improve ending up with about 900 induced cc reactions in the karmen detector after a measuring period of 23 years .",
