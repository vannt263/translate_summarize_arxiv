    "the lagrange value of a real also equals its lagrange value with respect to @xmath11 , the subgroup generated by the cubes of @xmath10  this , since left cosets of this subgroup have representatives that are translations .",

    "this is a common supergroup of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; the three uniformized `` surfaces '' ( in the presence of torsion elements , a group uniformizes rather an orbifold ) have their simple closed geodesics in respective one - to - one correspondences . using a.  schmidt s results , sheingorn also showed that a similar relationship holds throughout the teichmller spaces of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",

    "+ in a previous paper @xcite , we reproved mcshane s @xcite celebrated identity @xmath14 where the sum is taken over all simple closed geodesics of any fixed hyperbolic once - punctured torus , and @xmath15 is the length of the geodesic .    our approach was to show that the hausdorff dimension of a set related to the `` height achieving '' simple geodesics is zero .",
    "in fact , we worked on the sphere formed by taking the quotient of the torus by its elliptic involution ; the corresponding uniformizing group has many elliptic elements of order two .",
    "each element of order two acts so as to define a `` lifting '' region in which no highest points of geodesics can exist .",
    "we showed that a set , indexed over the simple closed geodesics , of these regions meets the `` fundamental horocycle '' in a union of disjoint intervals , and the complement of these intervals has hausdorff measure zero .",
    "elementary bookkeeping then gives the identity .",
    "the argument both reproves the identity and shows that the set of simple geodesics that have a highest point ( which always lie on or below the fundamental horocycle ) has hausdorff dimension zero .",
    "but , there also exist simple geodesics that never achieve their highest point .",
    "one need say a bit more so as to find the size of the set of these `` non - achieving '' simple geodesics .",
    "we do this in the present paper .",
    "we replace our `` lifting regions '' intersecting the fundamental horocycle by the `` shadows '' projected onto the real line by ( some of ) the horocycles in the group orbit of the fundamental horocycle .",
    "no element of the shadow can be the foot of a simple non - achieving geodesic .",
    "but , each simple closed geodesic gives rise to a maximal interval of overlapping shadows , and the length of each such interval equals the length of the intervals defined by the lifting regions .",

    "the set of all real numbers whose partial quotients take on only these two values has hausdorff dimension larger than @xmath17 , as good @xcite showed in 1941 ; see jenkins and pollicott s @xcite for more recent results .",
    "the modern approach relies on the thermodynamic formalism , simplified by the fact that two operators stabilize the set .",
    "this approach has roots including the work of bumby @xcite , who showed that the hausdorff dimension of the set of reals of lagrange value at most @xmath18 is less than @xmath17 ( see @xcite for a sketch of the proof ) .",
    "the lagrange value three set is not determined by merely two operators , thus this approach would be awkward in the determination of its hausdorff dimension .",

    "whereas each successor shadow involved in a dribble is _ centered _ at a vertical tangent line to the horocycle anchored at its predecessor and thus has half of its shadow overlapping with that of its predecessor , the corresponding ratio goes to zero in the settings of lemmas  [ l : markoffoverlaptoleft ] and [ l : markoffoverlaptoright ] .",

    "since each shadow is a non - empty interval with endpoints being a descendant , the dribble is the union of overlapping intervals .",
