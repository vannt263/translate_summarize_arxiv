    "as part of a broader interest in complex systems , the analysis of large networks of interacting agents or simply certain degrees of freedom is currently under intense study . recently",
    "a presumably far - reaching core - concept came to the fore , called the small - world effect , ( for an incomplete list of references see , for example @xcite to @xcite ) . to put it briefly",
    ", the presence of a surprisingly small number of random edges , inserted in an initially quite regular graph , may have drastic effects as to the average distance between nodes or the expected diameter of the network .",
    "these additional random edges , called short cuts , may typically connect regions which have been quite a distance appart in the original regular graph , thus effecting a drastic shrinkage of average distance or diameter in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy that we detected a similar phenomenon in quite a different area of modern physics ( quantum space - time physics ) at almost the same time , being completely unaware of similar findings in other fields of natural science .",
    "we called this phenomenon a microscopic wormhole structure ( @xcite,@xcite ) .    to understand this smallworld effect in more quantitative terms ,",
    "a simple model , the so - called strogatz - watts - model , was investigated in more detail in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and a little bit later also in @xcite .    in its most tractable form",
    "it consists of @xmath0 linearly ordered vertices ( nodes ) with periodic boundary condition ( i.e. node @xmath1 is linked to node @xmath2 ) . in general",
    "each node may also be linked to its regular neighbors up to order @xmath3 .",
    "the generic case is already given for @xmath4 ( i.e. nearest neighbors only or @xmath5 ) .    to mimic the random - rewiring of edges of the original strogatz - watts - model , it is convenient to superimpose the given regular graph by a random graph , living over the same set of vertices .",
    "while we prefer to introduce the so - called edge - probability @xmath6 , that is , the independent probability for the existence of an edge between two nodes , as is usually done in the random graph framework ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) , some authors ( for certain reasons , which come from the original idea of rewiring existing links ) made a different choice , referring the probability of a random edge ( or shortcut ) to the number of nodes , @xmath0 , in the graph ( for the case @xmath4 ! ) .",
    "the relation between these two probabilities , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is descibed at the beginning of the following section .",
    "important ( random ) graph characteristics to be employed in detecting the small - world effect are the ( expected ) diameter of the graph and the mean - distance between pairs of nodes .",
    "a little bit surprisingly , it turns out to be possible to estimate or calculate these quantities in the strogatz - watts - model as functions of the two parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "this is remarkable as one has to deal with two coupled nonlinear difference or differential equations for the variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 described in the following section or the figure caption to figure 1 .",
    "the degree of nonlinearity varies of course depending on the extent of approximations being made .",
    "the general observation is that , depending on the number of shortcuts in the network , there exist several regimes in the parameter space . to put it more succinctly , we solve , on the one hand , the equations of the model for fixed @xmath6 and @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting to study the limit @xmath10 with @xmath11 now a function vanishing for large @xmath0 .",
    "that is , in this latter case , we analyse the different asymptotic regimes around the `` point '' @xmath12 . in the first case",
    "one can study the change of behavior of the network for either @xmath0 fixed and changing @xmath6 or vice versa .",
    "for very small @xmath6 ( more precisely , very few shortcuts ) the average distance , for example , scales linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "for still quite small @xmath6 one expects a ( transition like ) threshold or , rather , a threshold region , above which the average distance ( or the diameter ) scales roughly like in a sparse random graph , i.e. more or less logarithmically .",
    "there was a certain debate about the nature of this transition zone .",
    "we show in the following that instead of a threshold one actually has a relatively `` broad '' cross - over region in which the scaling changes in a smooth way from linear through @xmath13 $ ] ( in first order ) to @xmath14 depending on @xmath6 . more precisely , if we scale @xmath6 with @xmath0 and choose @xmath0 large the corresponding values of the edge probability are @xmath15 ( linear ) , @xmath16 ( intermediate ) , @xmath17 ( logarithmically ) , respectively .",
    "the original threshold was ( in our units ) conjectured to occur for @xmath18 .",
    "another interesting conjecture , which was then corroborated both numerically and by plausibility arguments , was a finite - size - scaling ansatz for the shape of the functional dependence of the average distance , @xmath19 , on @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "we were able to confirm this ansatz modulo some deviations which occurred in a certain region of the parameter space .    at the end of the paper",
    "we introduce a ( fractal - like ) notion of dimension for networks and calculate the dimension of the small - world - network .    to briefly characterize our own approach , we include , on the one hand , more possibly relevant terms making hence the evolution equations more complicated .",
    "in contrast to using then approximate solutions we manage to derive upper and lower bound comparison difference equations ( differential equations ) for the `` exact '' solutions , which allow us to enclose them from above and below . by this method",
    "we are able to compare the reliability of the various ( approximate ) results produced in the literature , relate them to our exact bounds and represent them in a single diagram .",
    "last but not least we were quite scrupulous to compensate for the possible quantitative errors ( coming from overcounting ) which are easily introduced by being too cavalier as to the ( thumb rule like ) spreading argument frequently envoked for random graphs .",
    "we expect that our method of providing comparison difference or differential equations for complicated non - linear equations , which , on their side , are presumably not solvable , may represent a strategy which might prove useful in a more general context .",
    "we start from the graph @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath0 nodes on a line with periodic boundary condition ; that is , node @xmath1 is linked to node @xmath2 .",
    "+ remark : to make the red thread of our analysis better visible , we treat for the time being only the nearest neighbor model .",
    "a node @xmath20 is only connected to @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath4 , or coordination number @xmath22 ) .",
    "the more general case is a straightforward generalisation and can be reduced to the case @xmath4 by a renormalization step , cf .",
    "+ in a next step we superimpose this graph with a true random graph , living on the same @xmath0 nodes and having independent edge probability @xmath6 ( cf . for example @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this entails that the expected number of random edges in our model is @xmath23 ( the average vertex degree in the respective random graph ) and the expected number of random edges being incident with a fixed but arbitrary node , @xmath20 , is @xmath24 .",
    "note that with this definition it may happen that some of the nearest regular neighbors of a node @xmath25 , can now also be linked to @xmath25 by a random edge .",
    "this plays however no role in the global analysis and could of course be avoided but makes the numerical analysis more compact .",
    "the above @xmath6 should be compared with the probability , @xmath7 , occurring in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the latter one is referred to the existing number of regular ( non - random ) edges , that is @xmath26 , or @xmath0 for @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for this derives from the original model in which existing edges were randomly rewired .",
    "thus , for @xmath4 , @xmath7 leads to an expected number of random edges in the graph equal to @xmath27 instead of @xmath23 in our model ( @xmath0 large ) .",
    "the two probabilities are hence related by @xmath28 if we refer them to the same global expected number of shortcuts in the superimposed random graph .",
    "we are in particular interested in the small world effect .",
    "what is usually studied is the mean distance , @xmath29 , between two arbitrarily selected nodes , @xmath20 and @xmath30 .",
    "note that graphs are discrete metric spaces in a natural way , the distance @xmath31 being given by the length of a shortest path , connecting them ( number of consecutive edges ) .",
    "if the individual realisations of graphs or networks belong to a sample ( probability ) space , an averaging has to be performed both over the selected pairs of nodes and the sample space ( cf .",
    "@xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this quantity is closely related to another important graph characteristic , the ( expected ) diameter , which we will study in the following .",
    "choosing an arbitrary start node , @xmath25 , the graph metric allows to define l - neighborhoods , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and their respective boundaries , defined by @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the number of nodes lying in @xmath36 , the sequence of this values is called the distance degree sequence relative to node @xmath25 and is denoted by @xmath37 . when tabulating this for the full node set we arrive at the distance distribution @xmath38 with @xmath39 the number of pairs of nodes having distance equal to @xmath40 ( @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we have the following formula for the mean distance : @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the number of different pairs of nodes .",
    "the number @xmath43 , that is , the maximal distance occurring in this counting is called the diameter of the graph .    evidently , @xmath29 and @xmath44 can not be expected to be the same numerically but in the generic situation one may surmise that they are closely related and scale in the same way for , say , @xmath10 ( being motivated by the qualitative picture of spreading in a random graph ) . while the precise analytic calculation of the degree sequence @xmath45 , the mean distance or the diameter is a quite ambitious task in the random graph framework",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , the qualitative behavior can be inferred as follows .",
    "if the edge probability , @xmath6 , is sufficiently low , a randomly selected node , @xmath25 , has on average @xmath46 neighbors and roughly @xmath47 second neighbors and so on as long as the number of vertices being reached is not to large compared to the total number @xmath0 .",
    "if this latter condition does no longer hold , the probability increases that one meets a given vertex twice . hence , due to this overcounting the true numbers are systematically smaller , the deviations becoming appreciable when @xmath0 is approached .    in the sequel",
    "we therefore employ the following strategy . instead of calculating the exact distance degree sequence or the exact diameter of our small world model , we calculate , among other things , the number of steps necessary to reach the fraction @xmath48 of nodes with @xmath49 preferably chosen as @xmath50 . in this way",
    "we hope to avoid the problems of overcounting at least to a large degree , while , on the other hand , we expect the scaling behavior of the respective quantities to be more or less the same as for the true numbers .",
    "as we remarked at the end of the preceding section , we want to estimate the expected number of steps necessary to reach , for example , half of the number of vertices , starting from a fixed but arbitrary vertex , @xmath25 .",
    "we expect that this quantity displays the same @xmath0- and @xmath6-dependence as the mean distance or the diameter of the network or graph under discussion , avoiding at the same time the problem of overcounting or , on the other hand , of very complex equations when approaching the total number of vertices , @xmath0 .",
    "as has been done in @xcite , we choose the following two variables .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the expected number of nodes , not reached after n steps , starting from an arbitrary but fixed node , @xmath25 ( `` free nodes '' ) .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the number of gaps , that is , the number of ( connected ) segments of nodes , lying on the original @xmath5 , not yet reached and which are separated by the segments of nodes already reached after @xmath51 steps ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "we note that our evolution equations describe the evolution of mean- or expected values . in some respects",
    "this approach hence shares some characteristics with what one calls mean - field theory in statistical mechanics ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "however , we think , the approximations being made by us are not so drastic as in typical mean - field models , where , among other things , hamiltonians are typically strongly modified ( frequently almost linearized ) .",
    "this is not the case in the small - world model which , in particular in our approach , contains strongly non - linear terms which encode at least part of the fluctuation content in integrated form ( see , for example , the discussion about the inclusion of terms incorporating the effects of very small gaps around eqn ( 10 ) ) . in a sense , what we call `` full equations '' in the following rather describe the behavior of a `` typical '' or generic small - world graph .",
    "so it does not come as a terrible surprise that the evolution equations for the expected values are in relatively good agreement with what follows from real numerical simulations of the model .",
    "on the other hand , statistical fluctuations and correlation are not really treated by us while this could be done in principle as the underlying probability space is explicitly given , that is , the regular graph @xmath5 superimposed with a random graph for which probability theory is well established .",
    "one therefore may make the slightly vague statement that the small - world model is , depending on the degree of approximations , of an intermediate character .",
    "to arrive at equations which are not only asymptotically correct or are only good in a restricted region of parameter or phase space , we try to include as many relevant terms as possible ( under the proviso that the resulting coupled and non - linear difference or differential equations are still solvable ) .",
    "we start with the difference equation , describing the expected change of the number of gaps between consecutive steps .",
    "for @xmath52 we have exactly one gap , comprising all the nodes except @xmath25 , that is we have @xmath53 .",
    "the number of gaps increases only due to the consecutive inclusion of shortcuts with increasing @xmath51 , connecting pairs of nodes in a random manner and being parametrized by the edge probability @xmath6 .",
    "the main contribution in consecutive steps , @xmath54 , comes from the term @xmath55 .",
    "we will further explain it after the introduction of equation ( [ diffeqf ] ) .",
    "there exists however another contribution which acts in the opposite direction and which becomes relevant when already many gaps do exist .",
    "this term reads @xmath56 and is of a purely combinatorial ( more involved ) character to be explained below when discussing equation ( [ diffeqf ] ) .",
    "the initial condition for @xmath57 reads @xmath58 . for @xmath4",
    "each gap of free nodes shrinks by two in the next step provided the gap comprises more than one node .",
    "neglecting in a first step this latter possibility , the first contribution is hence of the form @xmath59 .",
    "then there is a contribution coming from new shortcuts of the form @xmath60 .",
    "the overcounting in the first term ( neglection of one - node gaps ) has now to be compensated by a term @xmath61 .",
    "the emergence of this and the corresponding term in equation ( [ diffeqg ] ) will be explained in greater detail below .",
    "@xmath62    we furthermore have the following apriori bounds which immediately follow from the meaning of the respective variables in our model system :    we have @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    proof : each gap is followed by a non - empty string of nodes being already covered , hence the first inequality . the second one follows as each gap contains at least one node.@xmath65    the occurrence of the term @xmath66 can be understood as follows . in each step ,",
    "@xmath54 , the two endpoints of each of the @xmath9 gaps may become the source of new shortcuts to the remaining @xmath8 free nodes , the expected number being @xmath67 .",
    "this leads hence to a term of the above form in both equations .",
    "one can even be a little bit more precise if one wants to .",
    "new gaps are not created if the shortcuts end at free nodes which are adjacent to nodes already reached .",
    "there are on average @xmath68 of them .",
    "that is , in the equation describing the evolution of gaps the correct term is @xmath69 .",
    "the equation describing the evolution of @xmath8 is not altered .",
    "this additional correction term is always negative and we could in principle incorporate it in the following .",
    "it will make the whole numerics slightly nastier without making a big effect .",
    "so we will largely neglect this term but will incorporate it into what we call the  full equations  , see ( [ fulldiffeqg ] ) .",
    "the other quadratic nonlinear terms are slightly more intricate and of a more stochastical nature . while in equation ( [ diffeqf ] ) gaps containing only one node",
    "will contribute only one instead of two nodes in the difference equation , in equation ( [ diffeqg ] ) gaps vanish in the next step if at level @xmath51 they contain only one or two nodes .",
    "the probability for the existence of such gaps will now be calculated .",
    "we begin with the case of one - gaps .",
    "we will solve this problem with the help of the well - known partitioning problem of a given set into disjoint subsets .",
    "we associate the set of @xmath70 gaps and @xmath57 free nodes with @xmath57 balls to be distributed over @xmath70 boxes . in general there",
    "exist @xmath71 combinations ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . in effect",
    "we calculate the number of different words of length @xmath72 consisting of @xmath73 bars and @xmath57 dots , under the proviso that each word begins and ends with a bar and that each consecutive pair of bars is divided by a non - empty string of dots as in our case no box can be empty .",
    "this implies that we can place exactly one ball in each box and perform the above calculation , ( 7 ) , which represents the number of partions without the constraint of non - empty boxes , for the remaining number of @xmath74 balls , yielding @xmath75 configurations .",
    "this is the cardinality of the set of elementary events in our probability space .    to calculate the expected number of gaps containing only one or two nodes",
    ", we introduce the following random variables , @xmath76 over the probability space of words , we associated with the random graphs @xmath77 : @xmath78 in each of the above @xmath79 configurations ( graphs ) , @xmath77 . before we proceed a short remark as to the probabilities of the individual configurations should be in order .    in our model probability space a regular graph is superimposed by a random graph with edge probability @xmath6 . in our above calculation we deal with fixed numbers @xmath57 and @xmath70 .",
    "as the gaps arise due to the existence of random edges , the gaps are expected to be randomly scattered over the regular graph @xmath5 in basically the same way as pairs of nodes are linked by random edges , that is , almost independently .",
    "this then should also essentially hold for the number of gaps , met after @xmath51 steps . furthermore , this reasoning should not be affected in a serious way by the possible annihilation of gaps for large step - number @xmath51 , as long as we stay away from the regime where the spreading argument for random graphs is no longer correct . from this",
    "we see that it is a reasonable strategy to remain below the value @xmath80 with the step number @xmath51 .",
    "we hence conclude that in the indicated regime each configuration should have the independent probability @xmath81 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath82 for the one - gaps we can represent @xmath83 by more elementary random variables , @xmath84 with @xmath3 running from @xmath85 to @xmath70 , enumerating the existing @xmath70 gaps and @xmath86 if gap @xmath87 contains only one element and zero else .",
    "this yields @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of configurations with only one element in gap @xmath87 .",
    "correspondingly we get for the expected number of @xmath91-gaps : @xmath92 for the one - gaps this yields @xmath93 for the two - gaps we have @xmath94 and for @xmath57 large , i.e. @xmath95 : @xmath96 with our apriori estimate @xmath97 and as we start from the initial conditions @xmath98 in most of our phase space the dominant contribution comes from the term @xmath99 also in the case of two - gaps .",
    "the expected number of one- or two - gaps is approximately @xmath100    ( note that in our probability space the possibility of being a 1-gap or a 2-gap is mutually exclusive ) .",
    "this result explains the occurrence of the correction terms in our evolution equations . without these approximations , the equations ( [ diffeqg ] ) and ( [ diffeqf ] )",
    "would read @xmath101 with @xmath57 and @xmath70 instead of @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the rhs .",
    "we ll refer to these as `` full equations '' and compare them with the simplified ones ( ( [ diffeqg ] ) and ( [ diffeqf ] ) ) in figure [ diagfexamples ] . note in particular that we approximated the last term occurring in [ fulldiffeqg ] by @xmath102 in [ diffeqg ] , neglecting the positive higher order contribution , being essentially of the form @xmath103 .",
    "a brief comment is in order as to the corresponding formulas derived in @xcite ( cf . their formulas ( 3),(6 ) or ( a10),(a11 ) ) .",
    "we decided to neglect all terms in ( [ e ] ) except the leading one , @xmath104 , which is reasonable in our view .",
    "in @xcite , in the corresponding equation an additional term of the type @xmath105 occurs ( derived by a different argument ) . on the other hand , more important in our view",
    "is equation ( [ diffeqf ] ) , which comprises three terms in our approach ( including a nasty non - linear one , @xmath104 ) , while in @xcite only the first one , @xmath106 , occurs on the rhs .",
    "this makes the corresponding equations of course much easier to solve but may only be a good approximation in a restricted regime of parameter space ( see the brief discussion at the end of section [ quantitative ] ) .",
    "we discuss and compare the numerical results in section [ scaling ] .",
    "one can see that the solution of @xcite is similar to our lower bound - equation for @xmath57 ( eqn ( [ ftildeeqn ] ) ) , which is reasonable as in our lower bound for @xmath57 the quadratic term is largely suppressed ( cf . the following section and figure [ diagscalingfunction ] ) .",
    "the above system of evolution equations contains non - linearly coupled quantities and can be solved only in very exceptional lucky circumstances .",
    "instead of making more or less uncontrollable approximations , we develop the following strategy .",
    "we try to enclose the above exact equations by comparison equations bounding the exact solutions , @xmath107 , from above and below , the corresponding variables being denoted by @xmath108    the problem is that , on the one hand , the comparison equations have to be so chosen that they can be rigorously solved and , on the other hand , these bounds have to be quite good so that we are able to infer something relevant also for the enclosed exact equations in particular for the scaling limit @xmath0 very large and @xmath6 a vanishing function of @xmath0 .",
    "a central role will be played by the value @xmath109 for which we have reached on average @xmath80 of the nodes when starting from an arbitrary but fixed node @xmath25 ( or more generally @xmath110 nodes with @xmath111 ) . in other words , the range of @xmath51-values we are using is restricted by @xmath112\\quad \\text{so that}\\quad ( n-1)=f(0)\\geq f(n)\\geq \\alpha n\\ ] ]    we now study the rhs of the equations ( [ diffeqg ] ) , ( [ diffeqf ] ) . for one ,",
    "we assume that these equations have been solved for our initial conditions @xmath113 , so that @xmath114 now represent particular functions of @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand we can regard the rhs ( dropping the dependence on the variable @xmath51 ) as functions on the phase space , spanned by the possible values of the variables @xmath115 . in our assumed range of possible parameters and variables",
    "we have the estimate @xmath116    the idea is now to introduce the comparison difference equations @xmath117 and @xmath118 with the initial conditions @xmath119 for the initial differences we have @xmath120    our strategy is now to use these comparison equations to learn something about the true equations . unfortunately matters are not so transparent for difference equations as compared to differential equations .",
    "the reason is that they are only given at discrete points and may ( therefore ) display a more complex behavior ( see for example hoelders theorem and extensions thereof in @xcite , p.283 or @xcite , p.220 ) . due to these problems we will in the following",
    "go over to the corresponding differential equations , being however aware of the fact that it does not seem to be an easy task to provide good error estimates , in particular as the differences in our context are not infinitesimal ( as to this interesting question of principle cf .",
    "the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "what is furthermore remarkable is the observation ( see below ) that we can prove a useful theorem in the case of differential equations the analogue of which , as far as we can see , we can not prove for difference equations ( at least with the same methods ) .",
    "the corresponding differential equations read : @xmath121 with @xmath122 $ ] so that @xmath123 . the comparison differential equations with respect to @xmath124 are @xmath125 with @xmath126 .    as to equation ( [ differentialf ] ) we proceed as follows ( we note that we in fact experimented with different possibilities ; the one we are presenting below seems to be the most appropriate one ) .",
    "we mentioned above the apriori bound @xmath97 .",
    "for the rhs of equation ( [ differentialf ] ) we then have : @xmath127 on the other hand we have also @xmath128 therefore our comparison differential equations for @xmath57 are @xmath129 with @xmath130 . + remark : as @xmath0 is supposed to be very large , it does not make a big difference for the numerical calculations to let all the initial values be equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the above choice makes the analytic argument a little bit simpler ( see below ) .    to further exploit these comparison equations we proceed as follows .",
    "note that we have succeeded in decoupling the equations for @xmath57 and @xmath70 .",
    "we can solve the differential equations for @xmath131 and @xmath132 and plug the solutions into the @xmath133- and @xmath134-equation .",
    "we assume that together with the comparison differential equations the original differential equations for @xmath70 and @xmath57 have been solved for the mentioned initial conditions . in the differential equation for @xmath70 with initial condition",
    "@xmath53 we can then regard the corresponding @xmath57-solution as an external function with @xmath124 solving this `` new '' differential equation ( together with the given initial condition ) .",
    "we compare the solution @xmath124 of this latter equation with the solutions of the differential equations for @xmath135 respectively .",
    "we have @xmath136    we now prove the following result .",
    "let @xmath137 and @xmath138 be solutions of the two differential equations @xmath139 on the interval @xmath140 $ ] with @xmath141 .",

    "if @xmath150 for some @xmath151 , there exists an @xmath152 ( by continuity ) with @xmath153 and @xmath150 in an open interval @xmath154 .",
    "but this is a contradiction since @xmath155 hence again implying that @xmath156 in an open interval @xmath157 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath158 on @xmath140$].@xmath65    it sometimes happens that we have @xmath159 on the open interval @xmath160 but @xmath161 for some value @xmath162 .",
    "we then can prove the following corollary :    making the same assumptions as before except for @xmath161 instead of @xmath163 .",
    "we assume that there exists a parameter @xmath164 so that on the closed interval we have @xmath165 for @xmath166 and @xmath167 , the dependence on @xmath164 being continuous or differentiable .",
    "then the parameter dependent solutions converge pointwise towards the solutions for @xmath168 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath166",
    "our above result applies .",
    "so , by continuity it applies also in the limit @xmath169 .",
    "note that in our case the parameter @xmath164 is the parameter taking the values @xmath170 etc .",
    "+ remark : we surmise that such comparison results are known in the large literature about differential equations but we were unable to find a reference .",

    "the corresponding @xmath214-neighborhoods @xmath222 and @xmath223 of @xmath220 and @xmath221 are not disjoint the distance between @xmath220 and @xmath221 must be less than @xmath224 . if these neighborhoods are disjoint the graph @xmath225 is a disjoint union of @xmath222 and @xmath223 and hence the distance between @xmath220 and @xmath221 must be exactly @xmath224 .",
    "as all these arguments apply only to the generic case , we can associate this value with the expected diameter of our network , denoted by @xmath226 and get the estimate @xmath227 remark : we again emphasize that this argument is only correct in an averaged sense in which all nodes are assumed to stand on the same footing .",

    "these bounds become invalid , as @xmath19 tends to one and the differential equations will no longer approximate the difference equations well enough .",

    "one may be led to the wrong conclusion that they are always marginal because initially @xmath70 is very small compared to the huge @xmath57 .",

    "the result strongly depends on the value of @xmath6 . inserting @xmath251 in the equation for @xmath248 and solving for @xmath151 we get @xmath252 .",

    "put differently , it is dangerous to neglect this term on apriori grounds .",
    "on the other hand , taking for example @xmath253 , and making the same calculation we infer that the non - linear term remains negligible in the domain we are interested in . for @xmath254",
    "we get of course intermediate results .",
    "the effects of neglecting the even smaller combinatorial terms which appear in the full eqns ( [ fulldiffeqg ] ) and ( [ fulldiffeqf ] ) can be seen in figure [ diagfexamples ] : here the neglection has a greater effect for the case @xmath253 than for @xmath255 , as the total number @xmath70 of gaps in the first case is smaller and therefore nearer to 1 than in the second case .",

    "thus the case @xmath266 is nt described correctly by this formula . for @xmath204 , @xmath19 , according to this scaling - ansatz , simply scales like @xmath270 , without any correction term of the form @xmath271 , which occurs in our above presumably more exact result .",
    "so , although @xmath19 correctly scales with @xmath14 in both cases ( depicting a random graph ) , there exist certain deviations for large @xmath244 .",
    "in @xcite , newman , moore and watts found the following expression for their universal scaling function @xmath272 for @xmath202 ( @xmath211 ) this function is a constant . on the other hand , for @xmath273 with @xmath274 ,",

    ", the error term of the probability @xmath291 rises above one and @xmath292 looses its meaning .",
    "in @xcite , two related dimensional concepts ( of a fractal type ) were introduced for infinite graphs ( note the close connection to the distance degree sequence , discussed in @xcite ) and a number of its properties proved .",
    "we learned later that this concept occurred already earlier in the literature but , as far as we can see , its interesting properties were never systematically studied ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a technically different but physically related concept was exploited by dhar ( @xcite ) , see also @xcite . furthermore ising models on such irregular spaces",
    "were studied recently , an early source being @xcite .",
    "the reason to deal with infinite graphs is that only in the limit @xmath10 the global notion of dimension becomes independent of local ( model dependent ) aspects like e.g. coordination numbers of , say , lattices , all having the same embedding dimension .",
    "one of the two definitions reads :    let @xmath225 be an arbitrary graph with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath293 the @xmath40-neighborhood of the vertex @xmath294 .",
    "then we define the _ dimension _ of @xmath225 ( relative to @xmath151 ) as @xmath295 ( provided the limit exists ; in general we have to deal with @xmath296 and @xmath297 ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown , that this notion of dimension ( also called the `` internal scaling dimension '' ) is independent of the initial vertex @xmath151 ( under a mild technical assumption ) . for finite ( but large ) and connected graphs we can instead employ the following graph characteristic : @xmath298 for real networks",
    "this value has been analysed in @xcite .",

    "figure [ diagfexamples ] ) . as @xmath301 ( see however the discussion after eqn([d ] ) ) , we get @xmath302 thus , for large enough @xmath0 and @xmath214 the approximate dimension does nt deviate too much when staying below @xmath80 and wo nt suffer from saturating - effects .    applying this concept to the small world model for large @xmath0",
