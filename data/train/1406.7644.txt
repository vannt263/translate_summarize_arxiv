    "@xmath2 decay is a magnetic dipole radiative transition in charmonium with the most probable photon energy @xmath8 of about 114 mev and a fairly large branching fraction of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this is a transition between 1@xmath10 states of the charmonium system and its rate can be easily calculated in potential models . in the nonrelativistic approximation ,",
    "the magnetic dipole amplitudes between @xmath10-wave states are independent of a specific potential model , because the spatial overlap equals one for states within the same multiplet . a simple calculation in the nonrelativistic approximation yields the result  @xcite @xmath11 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that relativistic corrections are of order @xmath12% , similarly to the case of the electric dipole transitions in the charmonium ( see , for example , the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in 1986 the crystal ball collaboration measured this branching fraction in the inclusive photon spectrum and obtained a much smaller value @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "there are a lot of theoretical predictions for this decay rate  @xcite , based on qcd sum rules , lattice qcd calculations and so on , but as a rule they lead to values approximately twice as large as the crystal ball result .",
    "this discrepancy remained unchanged for more than twenty years . during this period",
    "no new measurements of this branching fraction were performed , and the pdg average  @xcite was based on the single crystal ball result . only in 2009",
    "the cleo collaboration published the result of a new measurement  @xcite , in which 12 exclusive decay modes of the @xmath3 were analyzed .",
    "the obtained value @xmath14 is closer to theoretical predictions . combining the crystal ball and cleo results , pdg obtained @xmath15  @xcite with a scale factor of 1.6 . in this work",
    "we report the result of a new independent measurement performed using the inclusive photon spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of detected photons in @xmath16 decay is given by the formula  @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 is a photon energy , @xmath19 is the fine structure constant , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22-quark charge ( in electron charge units ) and mass , @xmath23 is the matrix element of the transition ( without relativistic corrections ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a breit - wigner function .",
    "a typical momentum transfer inside the charmonium bound state is about 700 to 800 mev  @xcite ( this is of the order of the inverse size of the system ) , so the matrix element is almost constant ( close to one ) up to such photon energies .",
    "therefore , in this energy range the decay spectrum @xmath26 . since @xmath27 at @xmath28 , the decay probability grows as @xmath18 when @xmath18 increases . if a resonance width is not small , it can give a noticeable tail in the photon spectrum at photon energies @xmath29 .",
    "for the @xmath2 transition we have @xmath30 . this value is not small , therefore we should take into account this tail .",
    "it should be also noted that in theoretical calculations of the decay rate this effect is as a rule neglected , and , assuming a small width of the resonance , @xmath18 is replaced with @xmath8 in ( [ fone ] ) .    at the same time",
    "it is known that the usual form of the breit - wigner function is applicable only in the close vicinity of a resonance and gives an overestimated value far from it .",
    "for example , in the theory of atomic transitions a photon absorption lineshape has the same functional form as a ( non - relativistic ) breit - wigner function , but with @xmath31  @xcite , so @xmath32 at @xmath29 .",
    "also , it should be taken into account that this function gives a correct description of the resonance in the limit of its zero width only .",
    "given this , the photon lineshape in the decay @xmath2 has the form @xmath33 where the correction factor @xmath34 is about one near the resonance and falls far from the resonance .    due to the @xmath35 factor and a fairly large @xmath3 width ,",
    "the photon lineshape in this decay is asymmetric , and this is confirmed experimentally .",
    "the crystal ball did not consider this issue in their publication , noting only that the @xmath35 factor was used in the fit of the spectrum in the convolution of the detector response function with the @xmath3 breit - wigner resonance shape .",
    "however , because of the large background , such an asymmetry can not be revealed using the data collected at the crystal ball .",
    "the cleo collaboration used exclusive decay modes of the @xmath3 , that allows one to suppress background strongly . as a result , it was found that the photon lineshape of this transition is really asymmetric .",
    "the breit - wigner function alone , traditionally used to describe resonances , provides a poor fit to data .",
    "its modification with the @xmath35 factor improves the fit around the peak , but gives a great tail at higher photon energies , as it was noted above . to suppress this tail , cleo used @xmath36 in their fit with @xmath37 mev",
    "however , such a form of matrix element is valid for harmonic oscillator wave functions only . also , the value of @xmath38 used in the fit is too small for the charmonium system and gives very fast fall of the matrix element with the photon energy increase . in addition , in their analysis cleo did not consider interference effects , which may be not small for exclusive spectra . when measuring the branching fraction @xmath39 , one should separate the events of @xmath2 decays from the background events .",
    "this requires either a knowledge of the photon lineshape or a background measurement with sufficient accuracy . as a rule ,",
    "the latter is a difficult task , especially for inclusive decays , because of the small signal to background ratio .",
    "therefore , to determine the number of signal events , during the data fitting one has to specify the explicit form of the resonance .",
    "however , considering that exact @xmath18 dependence of the @xmath34 factor in  ( [ ftwo ] ) is unknown , we can conclude that the measurement of @xmath39 will be inevitably model - dependent , until the photon lineshape will be measured or calculated theoretically with a sufficient accuracy . in this work",
    "we assume that the photon lineshape has the form  ( [ ftwo ] ) wherein @xmath34 is chosen under the assumption that the spectrum tail at photon energies @xmath40 can be neglected : at @xmath41 the factor @xmath42 , at @xmath40 the factor @xmath43 , and in the region @xmath44 the decay probability falls linearly .",
    "the experiment was performed at the kedr detector  @xcite of the collider  @xcite .",
    "it operates at a peak luminosity of about @xmath45 @xmath46 near the @xmath0 resonance energy .",
    "the luminosity is measured using single bremsstrahlung online and small - angle bhabha scattering offline .",
    "two methods of a beam energy determination are used : a resonant depolarization with an accuracy of @xmath47 kev and an ir - light compton backscattering with an accuracy of @xmath48 kev  @xcite .",
    "the view of the kedr detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    ]",
    "subsystems are listed in the figure .",
    "detector includes a tracking system consisting of a vertex detector and a drift chamber , a particle identification ( pid ) system of aerogel cherenkov counters and scintillation time - of - flight counters , and an electromagnetic calorimeter based on liquid krypton ( in the barrel part ) and csi crystals ( endcap part ) .",
    "the superconducting solenoid provides a longitudinal magnetic field of 0.6 t. a muon system is installed inside the magnet yoke .",
    "the detector also includes a high - resolution tagging system for studies of two - photon processes .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed in the drift chamber ( dc ) and vertex detector ( vd ) .",
    "dc has a cylindrical shape , with a 1100 mm length and an outer radius of 535 mm , and is filled with pure dimethyl ether .",
    "dc cells form seven concentric layers : four axial layers and three stereo layers to measure track coordinates along the beam axis .",
    "the coordinate resolution averaged over drift length is 100 @xmath49 .",
    "vd is installed between the vacuum chamber and dc and increases a solid angle accessible to the tracking system to 98@xmath50 .",
    "vd consists of 312 cylindrical drift tubes aligned in 6 layers .",
    "it is filled with an ar + @xmath51 co@xmath52 gas mixture and has a coordinate resolution of 250 @xmath49 .",
    "the momentum resolution of the tracking system is @xmath53)$ ] .",
    "scintillation counters of the time - of - flight system ( tof ) are used in a fast charged trigger and for identification of the charged particles by their flight time .",
    "the tof system consists of 32 plastic scintillation counters in the barrel part and in each of the endcaps .",
    "the flight time resolution is about 350 ps , which corresponds to @xmath54 separation at the level of more than two standard deviations for momenta up to 650 mev .",
    "aerogel cherenkov counters ( acc ) are used for particle identification in the momentum region not covered by the tof system and ionization measurements in dc .",
    "acc uses aerogel with a refractive index of 1.05 and wavelength shifters for light collection .",
    "this allows one to identify @xmath55 and k mesons in the momentum range of 0.6 to 1.5 gev .",
    "the system includes 160 counters in the endcap and barrel parts , each arranged in two layers . during data taking only one layer of acc",
    "was installed , and it was not used because of insufficient efficiency .",
    "the barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter is a liquid krypton ionization detector .",
    "the calorimeter provides an energy resolution of @xmath56 at the energy of 1.8 gev and a spatial resolution of @xmath57 mm for charged particles and photons .",
    "the endcap part of the calorimeter is based on 1536 csi(na ) scintillation crystals [ 18 ] with an energy resolution of @xmath58 at 1.8 gev , and a spatial resolution of 8 mm .",
    "the muon system is used to identify muons by their flight path in the dense medium of the magnetic yoke .",
    "it consists of three layers of streamer tubes with @xmath59 solid angle coverage , the total number of channels is 544 .",
    "the average longitudinal resolution is 3.5 cm , and the detection efficiency for most of the covered angles is @xmath60 .",
    "the trigger of the kedr detector has two levels : primary ( pt ) and secondary ( st ) .",
    "both pt and st operate at the hardware level .",
    "pt uses signals from tof counters and both calorimeters as inputs , its typical rate is @xmath61 khz .",
    "st uses signals from vd , dc and muon system in addition to the systems listed above , and the rate is @xmath62 hz .",
    "the analysis is based on a data sample of @xmath63 @xmath64 collected at the @xmath0 peak and corresponding to about 6 million @xmath0 decays .",
    "photon selection was performed in two steps . at",
    "the first step multihadron decays of @xmath0 were selected .",
    "the following criteria suppressing backgrounds from cosmic rays , beam - gas interactions and bhabha events , were applied : total energy in the calorimeters is greater than 0.8 gev ; at least four clusters with the energy greater than 30 mev in the calorimeters are reconstructed ; at least one central track in the drift chamber ( dc ) is reconstructed ; there are no muon tubes activated in the third layer of the muon system . at the second step photons in these events were identified .",
    "a cluster in the liquid krypton calorimeter is considered as a photon if it is not associated with reconstructed tracks in the drift chamber and has no time - of - flight counters activated in front of it . according to a monte carlo simulation based on the geant3 package  @xcite ,",
    "the photon detection efficiency for the @xmath2 decay in the investigated energy range with the above criteria is nearly constant with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the number of multihadron decays of @xmath0 selected at the first step of analysis is @xmath65 where @xmath66  @xcite and @xmath67 are the branching fraction and selection efficiency for @xmath0 multihadron decays and @xmath68 is the fraction of nonresonant multihadron plus other background ( mainly bhabha ) events that passed selection criteria . the number of signal photons is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a selection efficiency for @xmath3 multihadron decays and @xmath71 is a photon selection efficiency .",
    "hence @xmath72    according to the monte carlo simulation of @xmath0 decays using the generator  @xcite , based on the jetset code  @xcite and adopted by the bes collaboration for charmonium decays , the selection efficiencies @xmath67 and @xmath70 are close ( 87.9% and 89.0% , respectively ) .",
    "many systematic errors appearing due to selection cuts substantially cancel in their ratio , so these efficiencies were taken from the simulation during the branching fraction calculation .",
    "the photon selection efficiency @xmath73 was determined by imposition of mc photons on the multihadron events selected in the experimental @xmath0 decays .",
    "a small correction was applied to take into account a difference between the selection efficiency of photons , imposed on mc @xmath2 decays and @xmath0 multihadron decays .",
    "this difference was taken as an estimate of the systematic error for @xmath73 .",
    "the fraction @xmath68 was determined from the data sample collected at the energy of 10 mev below the @xmath0 resonance and is equal to @xmath74 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , b the inclusive photon spectrum and its fit are shown .    ]",
    "the spectrum was fit with a sum of the signal having the shape  ( [ ftwo ] ) , convolved with the calorimeter response function , and background .",
    "the calorimeter response function was approximated with a logarithmic normal distribution  @xcite with @xmath75 mev at 110 mev and asymmetry @xmath76 .",
    "the background has the following shape : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a second - order polynomial and mip@xmath79 is the spectrum of charged particles . the first term in the expression  ( [ f3 ] )",
    "well describes background in the photon energy range of @xmath80 mev .",
    "these photons arise mainly from @xmath81 decays , other processes give a small contribution . at lower photon energies background",
    "is not described by such a simple form because of the additional significant contribution from neutral clusters appearing due to nuclear interactions of hadrons in the calorimeter .",
    "due to inefficiencies of track reconstruction and tof counters , a small part of charged particles is misidentified as neutrals , so the scaled histogram of charged particles was added to the background function during the fit of the photon spectrum . in the fit ,",
    "parameters of the polynomial and @xmath22 coefficient were varied freely .",
    "the number of signal photons determined from the fit is equal to @xmath82 , while the number of the multihadron events selected is @xmath83 .",
    "the fit gives the following values of the @xmath3 mass , width and branching fraction of @xmath2 decay : @xmath84 mev/@xmath6 , @xmath85 mev and @xmath86 .",
    "the mass and width values are determined from the spectrum shape in the region of the resonance peak , thus for them the model uncertainty related to lineshape is small . at the same time",
    "this uncertainty for the branching fraction is mainly determined by the tail of the spectrum and is much larger .",
    "the fit of the spectrum using the lineshape  ( [ ftwo ] ) with @xmath87 gives @xmath88 , i.e. the decay rate can , in principle , be determined just by the tail .",
    "thus , the large model uncertainty for the branching fraction makes its measurement hardly meaningful .    however , it is possible to define another quantity , which characterizes the decay rate and is less model - dependent .",
    "to do that , let us write the photon spectrum of decay in the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 the resonance height in the fit weakly depends on the lineshape chosen , because due to the @xmath35 factor the spectrum quickly tends to zero to the left of the resonance .",
    "thus , the measured @xmath92 value has small model uncertainty .",
    "besides , if the resonance width tends to zero , the factor @xmath93 tends to unity , i.e. @xmath92 is the partial decay width in the case of a narrow resonance , and can be directly compared to theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "thus , this quantity has clear physical meaning and can be used as a characteristic of the decay rate . for our lineshape model",
    "the factor @xmath93 is about 1.12 and @xmath94 kev .",
    "a statistical error of the @xmath3 width obtained in the fit is much larger than the accuracy of its world average of @xmath95 mev , therefore the final values for mass and @xmath92 are obtained from the fit with fixed @xmath96 mev : @xmath97 mev/@xmath6 , @xmath98 kev .",
    "a systematic error related to the uncertainty of the @xmath3 width is estimated varying this value in the fit by 1.0 mev .",
    "the above results were obtained without taking into account interference effects .",
    "however , decays @xmath99 can interfere with other radiative decays of @xmath0 into the same final multihadron state @xmath100 . at first glance , for the inclusive spectrum these effects should be small due to a lot ( many dozens ) of @xmath3 decay channels and different relative phases of interference .",
    "however , recently the besiii collaboration published  @xcite results of a measurement of the @xmath3 mass and width analyzing six exclusive decay modes of @xmath101 decay , where it was found that the phases of interference with nonresonant background are close to each other for all decay modes . if the same holds for @xmath2 decays , then the interference effects for the inclusive spectrum may be not small and should be also taken into account .",
    "first of all , note that the @xmath102 decay amplitude can interfere with the amplitude of the @xmath103 decay .",
    "since the @xmath3 meson also decays mainly through two gluons , the lower - order feynman diagrams for these processes are the same .",
    "therefore it can be assumed that in these decays the relative interference phases are close for all decay channels ( if the quantum numbers of the final systems are the same ) .",
    "second , processes @xmath104 , @xmath105 , when one of the final hadrons radiates an additional photon ( fsr ) , should be also taken into account . however , in this case the diagrams of these processes are different , therefore it is reasonable to assume that the relative phases are different as well .    according to this ,",
    "the inclusive photon spectrum in the @xmath2 decay taking into account interference with @xmath103 decays can be written in the form@xmath106 where @xmath107 are resonant amplitudes , @xmath108 - nonresonant amplitudes of the k - th channel of @xmath0 decays through @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are resonant and nonresonant phase , respectively .",
    "partial widths for these decays are known for few decay channels , so we can only estimate an upper bound of this interference contribution , replacing the sum @xmath116 in the expression with unity .",
    "after that  ( [ fspeci0 ] ) takes the form which is analogous to interference in the single decay channel : @xmath117 where for a nonresonant term the explicit energy dependence according to  @xcite is specified .    to estimate the @xmath118 magnitude",
    ", mc simulation of @xmath0 decays using the generator  @xcite was performed .",
    "the generator poorly reproduces the experimental photon spectrum of @xmath119 decays , thus @xmath120 from the simulation has been corrected using data for this process  @xcite .",
    "an additional correction was made assuming that only a fraction of the @xmath119 decay amplitude with the same quantum numbers of the @xmath121-system and @xmath3 interferes .",
    "the probability for the @xmath121-system to have @xmath122 in this decay was calculated in the lowest order in  @xcite and equals 0.3 for small @xmath18 . with these corrections",
    "we estimate the @xmath120 value as @xmath123 of @xmath124 .",
    "the fsr contribution to interference was also estimated with the help of additional simulation in which the final state radiation was modeled using the photos  @xcite package , and phases of different decay channels were generated randomly .",
    "its value was found to be small compared to the @xmath109 contribution .",
    "the fit taking into account interference according to the expression  ( [ fspeci ] ) , with @xmath120 fixed to @xmath125 of @xmath124 and phase @xmath115 varied freely , gives the following values of @xmath3 mass , width and decay rate : @xmath126 mev/@xmath6 , @xmath127 mev , @xmath128 kev . in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b the interference contribution in this case is shown .",
    "the value of the obtained phase @xmath129 is close to zero , so the values of parameters for the second solution are almost the same .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath120 is quite small , therefore interference changes the measured values only slightly .",
    "these shifts are considered as systematic uncertainties due to interference effects .",
    "the main resulting systematic uncertainties are shown in table  [ ta3 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to estimate the systematic uncertainty related to the background subtraction , we varied the range of the fit , changed the order of the polynomial in the first term of  ( [ f3 ] ) from the second to third , and fitted the spectrum without taking into account time - of - flight counters .",
    "the systematic errors for the @xmath130 mass , width and @xmath92 , appearing due to a poorly known photon lineshape were estimated by changing the low energy cut - off parameter @xmath131 to @xmath132 , and taking @xmath87 .",
    "the calibration of the photon energy scale was performed using @xmath133 decays .",
    "within @xmath134 it agrees with the calibrations made with a data sample collected at the @xmath135 peak , using @xmath136 , @xmath137 transitions .",
    "no scale shift was observed for different seasons of collecting data . the systematic error related to the shape of the calorimeter response function",
    "was estimated by varying parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 of a logarithmic normal distribution .",
    "shifts of measured values due to interference effects in the table are given with signs .",
    "a new direct measurement of @xmath2 decay was performed .",
    "we measured the @xmath3 mass , width and decay rate @xmath92 of the @xmath2 decay .",
    "these parameters are sensitive to the lineshape of the photon spectrum in this decay and it was taken into account during analysis .",
    "these parameters were earlier measured in @xmath0 and @xmath140 meson decays as well as in @xmath141 and @xmath142 collisions .",
    "measurements of crystal ball  @xcite , mark3  @xcite , bes  @xcite , and kedr were performed using radiative decays of the @xmath0 resonance , therefore a mass shift due to an asymmetric lineshape should be taken into account .",
    "crystal ball and kedr made such a correction in their experiments , whereas mark3 and bes did not .",
    "therefore we believe that mark3 and bes results on the @xmath3 mass should be corrected by approximately 4 mev towards higher values due to this effect .",
    "interference effects for exclusive decays may give not small shifts and should be also analyzed .            crystal ball and cleo measurements as well as with theoretical predictions . the crystal ball and cleo results on @xmath92",
    "were evaluated using their measured branching fractions from the formula @xmath143 where @xmath144 kev is the @xmath0 width .",
    "factors @xmath93 were calculated from formula  ( [ ffcor ] ) . for crystal ball",
    "the function @xmath87 was taken and integration was made from 40 to 165 mev , which corresponds to the range of their spectrum fit . for cleo the function @xmath145 and @xmath146  @xcite were used .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath93 equal 0.96 and 0.99 , and partial widths are @xmath147 kev and @xmath148 kev , respectively .",
    "our decay rate value is significantly higher compared to those experimental results , but is well consistent with the latest lattice qcd prediction  @xcite : @xmath149 kev .",
