    "apparent horizons play an important role in numerical relativity for spacetimes containing black hole(s ) . being defined locally in time ( see section  [ sec : define ] ) , the apparent horizon(s ) can readily be computed from the data on each hypersurface during a numerical evolution in ( @xmath3 ) numerical relativity .",
    "in contrast , the event horizon is a global property and can be determined approximately only when the spacetime has essentially settled down to a stationary state .",
    "once the spacetime has settled down , the event horizon can be found at all previous times by integrating null geodesics backwards in time ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as it ( if exists ) must be inside an event horizon @xcite",
    ", the apparent horizon is an important tool to track the location and movement of black hole(s ) in a numerically generated spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the surface of an apparent horizon also provides a natural boundary within which the spacetime region can be excised from the computational domain in order to handle the physical singularities inside a black hole @xcite ( also see , e.g. , @xcite for black hole simulations without excision ) . in the new concept of a ` dynamical horizon ' ( see @xcite for reviews ) , apparent horizons are essentially the cross sections of the ( three - dimensional space - like ) dynamical horizon on the hypersurfaces .",
    "it has recently been shown in this context that the areas of the apparent horizons satisfy a causal evolution equation and give a positive bulk viscosity in a viscous fluid analogy @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the event horizon which yields a noncausal evolution and a negative bulk viscosity .",
    "a wide variety of algorithms for finding apparent horizons have been proposed in the past decade .",
    "we refer the reader to the review article by thornburg @xcite ( and references therein ) for details . in this paper",
    ", we present a new apparent horizon finder which is based on spectral methods . while the spectral - method - based algorithm for finding apparent horizons was first proposed by nakamura _",
    "@xcite more than 20 years ago , our new approach does not suffer from the same weakness as in the nakamura _",
    "et al _ algorithm : namely the @xmath0 coefficient of the spherical harmonics decomposition of the apparent horizon s surface needed to be determined by a root - finding procedure .",
    "hence , our algorithm leads to a more robust and efficient spectral apparent horizon finder .",
    "we have tested our finder with analytic solutions for single and two black - hole spacetimes .",
    "our finder is as efficient as the currently fastest algorithms developed by schnetter @xcite and thornburg @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : define ] we present the notations and various definitions . in section  [ sec : nak ] we briefly review the nakamura _",
    "_ algorithm ; we describe our spectral algorithm and the numerical procedure in section  [ sec : our_code ] .",
    "section  [ sec : tests ] presents tests with analytic solutions to assess the accuracy , robustness , and efficiency of our finder .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",

    "given a space - like hypersurface @xmath4 with future - pointing unit normal @xmath5 , the 3-metric @xmath6 induced by the spacetime metric @xmath7 onto @xmath4 is @xmath8 let @xmath9 be a closed smooth ( two - dimensional ) surface embedded in @xmath4 , and let @xmath10 be the outward - pointing unit normal of @xmath9 , which is spacelike and also normal to @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the 3-metric @xmath6 now induces a 2-metric on @xmath9 : @xmath13 let @xmath14 be the tangents of the outgoing future - pointing null geodesic whose projection on @xmath4 is orthogonal to @xmath9 .",
    "we have ( up to an overall factor ) @xmath15 on the 2-surface @xmath9 .",
    "the expansion of the outgoing null geodesics is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the covariant derivative associated with @xmath7 . in terms of three - dimensional quantities , on the 2-surface @xmath9 , the expansion can be written as ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the covariant derivative associated with @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the extrinsic curvature of @xmath4 and @xmath22 is the trace of @xmath21 .",
    "the expansion can also be written as @xmath23 the 2-surface @xmath9 is called a marginally trapped surface if @xmath24 everywhere on @xmath9 .",
    "we shall call here the outermost of such surfaces ( which is a marginally outer trapped surface - mots ) the apparent horizon .    to parameterize the apparent horizon , we assume that the topology of @xmath9 is a 2-sphere , and @xmath9 is star - shaped around the coordinate origin @xmath25 , which means that for every point @xmath26 inside @xmath9 , the straight line connecting the origin to @xmath26 is entirely inside @xmath9 @xcite . the position of the apparent horizon can then be represented as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the standard spherical coordinates . the function",

    "solving equation  ( [ eq : a00 ] ) by any iteration method is as computationally expensive as many steps of the main iteration loop .",
    "furthermore , equation  ( [ eq : a00 ] ) may have multiple roots or none . in those cases , each root or each minimum",
    "( if there is no root ) should be investigated separately @xcite .",
    "this clearly reduces the efficiency of the algorithm significantly .",
    "our spectral - method - based algorithm uses a similar ansatz ( [ eq : nko ] ) as nakamura _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",

    "to begin , we first introduce a flat metric @xmath49 on the hypersurface @xmath4 .",
    "the components of the flat metric with respect to the spherical coordinates @xmath28 , and the associated natural basis @xmath50 , are @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the covariant derivative associated with @xmath49 .",

    "the expansion function now becomes @xmath66 now let us consider the first term on the rhs of this equation : @xmath67 where we have set @xmath68 for the apparent horizon in the last equality . in equation  ( [ eq : theta_1stterm ] ) , we have used the following relation for the components of the covariant derivative @xmath69 of a 3-vector @xmath70 in the orthonormal basis @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 $ ] .",

    "et al _ , it is more appropriate to rewrite the apparent horizon equation @xmath24 as @xmath78 where the scalar function @xmath79 is chosen to be @xmath80 such that the combination @xmath81 cancels on the rhs of this equation .",
    "hence , the master equation that we solve in our algorithm is @xmath82 .",

    "however , he solved the equation using the finite - differencing method without pointing out the key advantage that , if solved by the spectral method , the coefficient @xmath47 ( as determined by our equation  ( [ eq : new_alm ] ) and his equation ( 1.3 ) in @xcite ) does not needed to be solved by the root - finding procedure . in this work , we solve the algorithm for the first time with spectral method .",

    "nevertheless , it is worth to point out that the original nakamura _ et al _ spectral algorithm @xcite would not produce any results for @xmath144 and 0.4 because equation  ( [ eq : a00 ] ) has no roots @xcite .",
    "we also see that the results are essentially independent of the direction of the offset .",
    "next we turn to brill - lindquist data for two black holes of equal mass .",
