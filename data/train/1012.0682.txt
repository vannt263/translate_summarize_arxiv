    "cell differentiation is a process by which dividing cells become specialized and equipped to perform specific functions such as nerve cell communication or muscle contraction .",
    "differentiation occurs many times during the development of a multicellular organism as the organism changes from a single zygote to a complex system with cells of different types .",
    "differentiation is also a common process in adult tissues . during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover",
    "a steady supply of somatic cells is ensured by proliferation of corresponding adult stem cells , which retain the capability for self - renewal .",
    "also various cancers are likely to originate from a population of cancer stem cells that have properties comparable to those of stem cells @xcite .",
    "stem cell state and fate depends on the environment , which ensures that the critical stem cell character and activity in homeostasis is conserved , and that repair and development are accomplished @xcite .",
    "cell differentiation and the maintenance of self - renewal are intrinsically complex processes requiring the coordinated dynamic expression of hundreds of genes and proteins in response to external signaling . during differentiation ,",
    "certain genes become activated and other genes inactivated in an intricately regulated fashion . as a result , differentiated cells develop specific structures and performs specific functions .",
    "there exists evidence that disorder in self - renewal behavior may lead to neoplasia @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that acute myeloid leukemia originates from a hierarchy of cells that differ with respect to self - renewal capacities @xcite .",
    "although much progress has been made in identifying the specific factors and genes responsible for stem cells decisions @xcite , the mechanisms involved in these processes remain largely unknown .",
    "while different genetic and epigenetic processes are involved in formation and maintenance of different tissues , the dynamics of population depends on the relative importance of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions , cell differentiation and death . the same genes and proteins are observed to be essential for regulation of different tissues @xcite .",
    "this unity and conservation of basic processes implies that their mathematical models can apply across the spectrum of normal and pathological ( cancer stem cells ) development .",
    "one established method of modeling such systems is to use a discrete collection of ordinary differential equations describing dynamics of cells at different maturation stages and transition between the stages .",
    "these so called multi - compartmental models are based on the assumption that in each lineage of cell precursors there exists a discrete chain of maturation stages , which are sequentially traversed , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , it is also becoming progressively clear that the differentiated precursors form such sequence only under homeostatic ( steady - state ) conditions .",
    "committed cells generally form a continuous sequence , which may involve incremental stages , part of which may be reversible . as an example , cell differentiation without cell divisions",
    "is observed during neurogenesis .",
    "moreover , in some tissues such as the mammary gland , different stages of differentiation are not well identified @xcite .",
    "these observations invoke not only the fundamental biological question of whether cell differentiation is a discrete or a continuous process and what is the measure of cell differentiation , but also how to choose an appropriate modeling approach . is the pace of maturation ( commitment ) dictated by successive divisions , or is maturation a continuous process decoupled from proliferation ? in leukemias , it seems to be decoupled .",
    "the classical view in normal hematopoiesis seems to be opposite .    to address these questions and to investigate the impact of possible continuous transformations on the differentiation process",
    ", we introduce a new model based on partial differential equations of transport type and compare this model to its discrete counterpart .",
    "the point of departure is a multi - compartmental model of a discrete collection of cell subpopulations , which was recently proposed in @xcite to investigate dynamics of the hematopoietic system with cell proliferation and differentiation regulated by a nonlinear feedback loop .",
    "furthermore , since self - renewal is an important parameter in our models , the proposed models seem to be a right departure point to investigate cancer development , for example in leukemias @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the discrete model to a structured population model accounting for a continuous process of differentiation of progenitor cells .",
    "models of the latter type have been already applied to the description of some aspects of hematopoiesis @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the assumption that differentiation of progenitor cells is a continuous process , which progresses with a constant velocity .",
    "mathematical description involves so called age - structured population equations .",
    "the model presented here is novel due to the nonlinearities in the coupling of the model equations , in particular the nonlinear coupling in the maturity rate function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_model ]",
    ", we formulate the new model . in section [ disccont ]",
    "the link between our model and the discrete model of @xcite is accomplished .",
    "sections [ analysis ] , [ section_extinct ] and [ section_stationary ] are devoted to the analysis of the model . in section [ analysis ]",
    "the existence and uniform boundedness of the solutions are shown . in section [ section_extinct ]",
    ", it is shown that depending on the value of a parameter characterizing stem cells self - renewal model solutions tend to zero or they stay separated from zero .",
    "section [ section_stationary ] provides the structure of steady states and conditions for existence of a positive stationary solution , while section  [ stability ] is devoted to a linearized problem around the positive steady state when this state exists to investigate its stability . using the characteristic equation we study some special cases , for which we show stability or instability of the positive stationary solution . in section [ numeric ] , a numerical approach and some results on stability and instability are presented .",
    "we conclude in section  [ concs ] with some final comments and suggestions for further investigation .",
    "in the following we assume that the dynamics of differentiated precursors can be approximated by a continuous maturation model . under this assumption",
    "we extend the multi - compartmental system from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the number of stem cells , @xmath1 the number of mature cells and @xmath2 the distribution density of progenitor cells structured with respect to the maturity level @xmath3 , so that @xmath4 is equal to the number of progenitors with maturity between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this includes maturity stages between stem cells and differentiated cells .",
    "thus , @xmath7 describes a population of stem cells and @xmath2 , for @xmath8 , corresponds to progenitor cells .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 denotes the last maturity level of immature cells , and therefore , @xmath10 describes the concentration of cells which differentiate into mature cells .",

    "cell divisions can be symmetric or asymmetric .",
    "we assume that on the average the fraction @xmath14 of progeny cells remains at the same stage of differentiation as the parent cell , while the @xmath15 fraction of the progeny cells differentiates , i.e. transfers to the higher differentiation stage .",
    "this covers the symmetric and asymmetric scenarios .",
    "parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the proliferation rate of stem cells and their death rate , respectively .",
    "progenitor cells differentiate at the rate @xmath18 , which depends on their maturity stage and is also regulated by the feedback from mature cells given by a signaling factor @xmath19 .",
    "parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the proliferation and death rates of precursor cells and depend on the level of cell maturation .",
    "mature cells do not divide and die at the rate @xmath22 .",
    "the whole process is regulated by a single feedback mechanism based on the assumption that there exist signaling molecules ( cytokines ) which regulate the differentiation or proliferation process .",
    "the intensity of the signal depends on the level of mature cells , and is modeled using the dependence @xmath23=\\frac{1}{1+kv(t)},\\ ] ] which can be justified using a quasi - steady state approximation of the plausible dynamics of the cytokine molecules , see @xcite .",
    "this expression reflects the heuristic assumption that signal intensity achieves its maximum under absence of mature cells and decreases asymptotically to zero if level of mature cells increases .",
    "the concentration of signaling molecules @xmath24 influences the length of the cell cycle ( proliferation rate @xmath25 ) and/or the fraction of stem cells self - renewal ( @xmath14 ) as well as the rate of cell maturation ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "+ in this model , differentiation of stem cells takes place during mitosis .",
    "the differentiation of progenitor cells occurs independently of proliferation .",
    "in other words , cells undergo continuous transformations between divisions .",
    "we call this process maturation . in the terms of the model",
    "this means that in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath26 , the following events occur to a cell of maturity @xmath3 ,    1 .",

    "this leads to a simplification of the boundary condition that becomes @xmath33        in this section we consider the relationship between the structured population model - and the multicompartmental model introduced in @xcite . following reference @xcite ,",
    "the multicompartmental model can be formulated in a general way , @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes a flux of cells from the subpopulation @xmath36 differentiating to the subpopulation @xmath37 .",
    "the terms @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe cell fluxes due to proliferation and death , respectively . in the general case proliferation or differentiation may depend on signal intensity .    in reference",
    "@xcite , differentiation was linked to proliferation and the following expressions were proposed : @xmath40 this is similar to what was defined for stem cells with @xmath16 and @xmath14 ; here @xmath41 represents the fraction of cells remaining at the same stage of differentiation @xmath36 as the parent cell while the @xmath42 fraction of cells differentiates to the higher stage @xmath43 formulation ( [ generalmodel])-([generalmodel : un ] ) describes the differentiation process independently of cell proliferation in the sense that cells either multiply at stage @xmath36 or differentiate from compartment @xmath36 to @xmath37 and so forth .",
    "assuming that cell differentiation occurs at a properly - chosen time scale compared to the time scale of the cell division process , we show in the next paragraph how to obtain , after a suitable renormalization , the structured population model of the next paragraph .",
    "let us write system  in a dimensionless way .",
    "we define @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 as characteristic values for the quantities @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 for @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "then , we define dimensionless quantities by @xmath60 etc .",

    "a precise discussion of the limiting process is outside the scope of this presentation .",
    "we refer , for instance , to @xcite for recent examples of how to obtain such limits based on moments estimates .    in order to interpret the terms @xmath69 in equation and @xmath70 in equation , as a finite differences tending to a derivative ,",
    "we take @xmath71 assuming that @xmath72 and @xmath73 tend toward limits @xmath74 and @xmath75 leads to @xmath76 in order to obtain that @xmath77 converges to the limit @xmath78 in equation , we require @xmath79 this means that the order of magnitude of the number of mature cells is much larger than the one of the maturing cells and stem cells .",
    "this can be interpreted by the fact that @xmath57 tends to @xmath80 a _",
    "density _ of cells per unit of maturity , whereas @xmath81 and @xmath59 are _ numbers _ of cells .",
    "this scaling follows also from mass balance considerations : system  leads to the following mass balance @xmath82 meaning that the exchange among compartments at maturation rate @xmath54 does not influence the total growth of the population . in this equation",
    ", we keep the specific values @xmath81 and @xmath59 and interpret the sum for @xmath83 as an integral .",
    "we obtain @xmath84 which leads to the following choice @xmath85 with this choice and the previous relations , we are led to choose @xmath86 which allows a limit for equation .",
    "we note however that this implies a different order of magnitude for @xmath87 and for @xmath88 the interpretation could be that we have divided the previous discrete compartments into smaller ones , of size @xmath89 where division does not occur but where maturation occurs . in this framework",

    "we note that we have used the fact that maturation and proliferation are decorrelated .",
    "if this were not the case , it would be impossible to make a @xmath118 factor appear in @xmath90 , since @xmath119 .",

    "we showed that perturbations in the regulatory mechanism may lead to the destabilization of the positive steady state , which corresponds to the healthy state of the tissue .",
    "in particular , we showed that the regulation of stem cells self - renewal is not sufficient for stability of the system and the lack of the regulation on the level of progenitor cells may lead to the persistent oscillations .",
    "this and other stability results suggest how imbalanced regulation of cell self - renewal and differentiation may lead to the destabilization of the system , which is observed during development of some cancers , such as leukemias . the model developed in this paper is rather general and , after adjusting it to specific biological assumptions , may serve as a tool to explore the role of different regulatory mechanisms in the normal and pathological development .    comparing the model to its discrete counterpart we addressed the question of the choice of the right class of models , for example discrete compartments versus continuous maturation , punctuated by division events .",
    "we showed that the models may exhibit different dynamics .",
    "interestingly , the structure of steady states varies and the discrete compartmental model admits semi - trivial steady states of the form @xmath335 , which do not exist in the continuous differentiation model .    to understand the difference between the two models , we derived a limit equation for the discrete model assuming that a continuum of differentiation stages can be defined .",
    "the rationale for such assumption is provided by the fact that differentiation is controlled by intracellular biochemical processes , which are indeed continuous in time , at least when averaged over a large number of cells .",
    "consequently , for the proper time scaling we have to assume that commitment and maturation of cell progenitors do not proceed by the division clock ( one division = one step in the maturation process ) but is a continuous process and can take place between the divisions .",

    "the structured population model is indeed not a limit of the discrete model with the transitions between compartments correlated to the division of the cells .",
