    "the first measurement of @xmath7 was reported two years ago by the sample collaboration@xcite , and led to @xmath8 a linear combination of strange electric and magnetic form factors has been measured by the happex collaboration@xcite : @xmath9(0.48{\\rm gev}^2 ) = 0.023 \\pm 0.034 \\pm 0.022 \\pm 0.026~.\\ ] ] further efforts are underway by various groups .. ]    it is important to recall that @xmath10 and @xmath11 contain more than just strangeness effects . even in a world of only two flavours ( up and down ) @xmath4 would be nonzero due to isospin violation .",
    "thus , the true effects of strange quarks can only be extracted from an experimental determination of @xmath4 if isospin violating effects can be calculated .",
    "dmitrainovi and pollock@xcite , and also miller@xcite , have studied the isospin violating contribution to @xmath11 within the nonrelativistic constituent quark model .",
    "ma has used a light - cone meson - baryon fluctuation model.@xcite more recently , a model - independent study of isospin violating effects ( using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ) has been published@xcite and it is this work which will be emphasized below , after a brief review of attempts to calculate the authentic strange quark effects .",
    "many attempts have been made to calculate the contribution of strange quarks to the `` strange '' electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath4 . in principle",
    "a lattice qcd calculation could give the definitive answer , and an exploratory calculation has been performed in the quenched theory.@xcite the errors due to finite lattice spacing , finite lattice volume and quenching are not yet known , but the existing results , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , still provide important inputs to the discussion .",
    "one might consider using chiral perturbation theory to calculate the strangeness contributions to @xmath4 , but both form factors have a free parameter at their first nonzero order in the chiral expansion , so the magnitude of neither form factor can be predicted from chiral symmetry alone .",
    "however , two experimental inputs are sufficient to fix these parameters , and chiral symmetry does determine the @xmath14-dependence of the form factors at leading chiral order .",
    "this tact has been taken by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who use the sample and happex measurements as input .    beyond lattice qcd and chiral perturbation theory , there are many models and dispersion relation methods which have been employed in the effort to determine the strange quark contributions to @xmath4 .",
    "( the authors of refs . @xcite have collected some predictions from the literature . )",
    "the various methods lead to differing results . for @xmath15 ,",
    "most predictions lie in the range @xmath16 and it has often been noted that this tendency toward a negative number does not seem to be supported by the experimental data , refs .",
    "predictions for the magnitude and sign of @xmath17 also span a large range .    a precise experimental measurement would help to distinguish between the various models of strangeness physics , but only after the isospin violating contribution has been calculated and subtracted .",
    "in a world with no strange quark , @xmath10 and @xmath11 do not vanish . instead , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are isospin violating quantities .",
    "if both the strange and isospin violating components of @xmath4 are small , then contributions which are both isospin violating _ and _ strange are doubly suppressed .",
    "the following discussion considers @xmath21 in a strange - free world .",
    "constituent quark model calculations have led to a vanishing result for @xmath22 and a very mild @xmath14 dependence : @xmath23@xcite .",
    "there is no symmetry which would force @xmath22 to vanish exactly , but perhaps the constituent quark model is trying to anticipate a `` small '' result .",
    "a light - cone meson - baryon fluctuation model permits a large range , @xmath24.@xcite    heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) is a natural tool for the study of @xmath21 . it is a model - independent approach which employs a systematic expansion in small momenta ( @xmath25 ) , small pion masses ( @xmath26 ) , small qed coupling ( @xmath27 ) , large chiral scale ( @xmath28 ) and large nucleon masses ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "it is appropriate to use @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and then the hbchpt lagrangian can be ordered as a single expansion , @xmath32 for the explicit form of the lagrangian , see ref . @xcite and references therein . for the present discussion , it is simply noted that @xmath33 contains parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath27 ; @xmath36 contains 11 parameters ( 7 strong and 4 electromagnetic ) ; @xmath37 contains 43 parameters ; @xmath38 contains hundreds of parameters and @xmath39 has even more .",
    "happily , it will be shown that @xmath19 is parameter - free at its first nonzero order , and @xmath20 is parameter - free at its first and second nonzero orders except for a single additive constant .",
    "the coupling of a vector current ( e.g. @xmath0 ) to a nucleon begins at first order in hbchpt , @xmath33 , but is isospin conserving . to be precise ,",
    "recall the usual notation , @xmath40u(\\vec{p})~,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes a particular flavour of quark .",
    "the sachs form factors for that flavour are @xmath42    an explicit calculation using @xmath43 leads to isospin violating vector form factors which vanish exactly . at first glance",
    "this might seem surprising , but it can be readily understood as follows .",
    "an isospin violating factor , such as @xmath44 , is suppressed by two hbchpt orders . moreover , the @xmath45 term in eq .",
    "( [ deffs ] ) has an extra explicit @xmath46 suppression factor , so isospin violating @xmath45 terms can not appear before @xmath38 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath47 is constrained by noether s theorem ( qcd s flavour symmetries : upness and downness ) to be unity plus momentum - dependent corrections , and dimensional analysis therefore requires a large scale , @xmath29 or @xmath28 , in the denominator of all corrections .",
    "this demonstrates that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 vanish in hbchpt until the fourth order lagrangian : @xmath38 .    a leading order ( lo ) calculation of @xmath19 or @xmath20 involves tree - level terms from @xmath38 plus one - loop diagrams built from @xmath48 .",
    "referring to ref .",
    "@xcite for details of the calculation and renormalization , the results are @xmath49 , \\\\",

    "the lo results for @xmath19 and @xmath50 are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . the contribution of isospin violation to @xmath17 is @xmath51 .",
    "consider next - to - leading order ( nlo ) . here",
    ", one expects tree - level terms from @xmath39 plus one- and two - loop diagrams built from lower orders in the lagrangian .",
    "since small hbchpt expansion parameters without uncontracted lorentz indices come in pairs ( e.g. @xmath14 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , the @xmath39 counterterms can contribute to @xmath47 but not to @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath20 is independent of these parameters at nlo , although @xmath19 is not .",
    "it is also found that no two - loop diagrams contribute to @xmath20 at nlo , although in principle they could have .",
    "furthermore , unknown coefficients from @xmath37 are also permitted to appear within loops , but none of them actually contribute .",
    "this means that the nlo corrections to @xmath20 are basic one - loop diagrams .",
    "the explicit result is given in ref .",
    "it needs to be stressed that the nlo contribution is parameter - free ; the only new quantities ( with respect to lo ) are the well - known nucleon magnetic moments .    the lo+nlo result for @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . notice that the nlo corrections serve to soften the @xmath14-dependence .",
    "the nlo correction to @xmath22 is @xmath54    the value of @xmath22 itself is not determined by chiral symmetry alone , and it receives contributions from physics other than the `` pion cloud '' of hbchpt ( consider , for example , isospin violation due to vector mesons ) .",
    "the pion cloud contribution to @xmath22 is estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite via a physically - motivated cutoff in hbchpt , and is comparable in size to the nlo contribution of eq .",
    "( [ nlo ] ) .",
    "the full result for the pion cloud contribution to @xmath20 is shown in fig .",
    "2 with error bands to reflect truncation of the hbchpt expansion : the narrow band assumes @xmath55 and the wide band assumes @xmath56 .",
    "the strange vector form factors of the proton are basic to an understanding of proton structure .",
    "the contribution due to strange quarks has proven to be a theoretical challenge .",
    "isospin violation also contributes to the so - called `` strangeness '' form factors , and this contribution must be calculated and subtracted from experimental data before the strange quark contribution can be identified .",
    "the present work indicates that chiral symmetry is of great value for discussions of the isospin violating effects . despite the large number of parameters in the lagrangian , @xmath19 is parameter - free at leading order , and @xmath20 has only one ( @xmath14-independent ) parameter at leading order , and no parameters at next - to - leading order .",
    "the isospin violating effects computed here are large compared to some models of the strange quark effects , but small compared to other models .",
    "the experimental results for the full `` strangeness '' form factors in eqs .",
    "( [ sameq ] ) and ( [ hapeq ] ) are not precise enough to indicate their size relative to the isospin violating contributions found in this work",
