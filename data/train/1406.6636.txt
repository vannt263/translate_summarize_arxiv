    "complex @xmath0-invariant modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equations @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 are real constants ) arise in many physical applications , such as short wave pulses in optical fibers @xcite and deep water waves @xcite .",
    "of particular mathematical and physical interest are the two integrable equations in this class , given by the hirota equation @xcite @xmath6 and the sasa - satsuma equation @xcite @xmath7 the integrability properties of these two equations consist of multi - soliton solutions , a lax pair , a bilinear formulation , a bi - hamiltonian structure , and an infinite hierarchy of symmetries and conservation laws .",
    "both equations possess ordinary soliton solutions of the form @xmath8 which are solitary waves with speed @xmath9 and phase angle @xmath10 .",
    "collisions of two or more solitary waves are described by multi - soliton solutions . in all collisions , the net effect on the solitary waves is to shift in their asymptotic positions , while their asymptotic phase angles stay unchanged in the case of the hirota equation but become shifted in the case of the sasa - satsuma equation .",
    "the actual nonlinear interaction of these solitary waves during a collision exhibits interesting features which depend on the speed ratios and relative phase angles of the waves , as studied in previous work @xcite .",
    "( see the animations at http://lie.math.brocku.ca/~sanco/solitons/mkdv_solitons.php )    in a recent paper @xcite , we began a comprehensive study of a more general type of soliton solution with the form @xmath11 which is a harmonically modulated solitary wave , called an _ oscillatory soliton _",
    ", where the temporal modulation frequency @xmath12 and the speed @xmath13 obey the kinematic relation @xmath14 this relation is required for the oscillatory soliton to be a solution of the the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation .",
    "in contrast to an ordinary soliton , the speed @xmath13 of an oscillatory soliton can be positive , negative , or zero .",
    "consequently , these solitons have three different types of collisions : ( 1 ) _ right - overtake _  where a faster right - moving soliton overtakes a slower right - moving soliton or a stationary soliton ; ( 2 ) _ left - overtake _  where a faster left - moving soliton overtakes a slower left - moving soliton or a stationary soliton ; ( 3 ) _ head - on _  where a right - moving soliton collides with a left - moving soliton .",
    "all of these collisions are described by oscillatory @xmath2-soliton solutions @xmath15 whose temporal frequencies @xmath16 , @xmath17 and speeds @xmath18 , @xmath19 satisfy the kinematic relations @xmath20    in the present paper we will study the asymptotic features of colliding oscillatory solitons for both the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation .",
    "these collisions can be expected to exhibit highly interesting new features compared to collisions of ordinary solitons .    in section  [ solns ]",
    ", we recall some details of the oscillatory @xmath1-soliton and @xmath2-soliton solutions derived in for the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation .    in section  [ asymptotics ] ,",
    "we carry out an asymptotic analysis using moving coordinates to show that the @xmath2-soliton solutions for the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation reduce to a superposition of two @xmath1-soliton solutions with speeds @xmath18 , @xmath19 and temporal frequencies @xmath16 , @xmath17 in the asymptotic past and future .",
    "this analysis rigorously establishes that these @xmath2-soliton solutions describe collisions between two oscillatory waves when both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are non - zero , or collisions of an oscillatory wave with a standing wave , when one of the speeds @xmath18 or @xmath19 is zero .    in section  [ com ] , for the @xmath1-soliton and @xmath2-soliton solutions",
    ", we discuss the primary constants of motion arising from the conservation laws for momentum , energy , and galilean energy admitted by @xcite the hirota equation and the sasa - satsuma equation .",
    "in particular , from conservation of galilean energy , we show that the center of momentum for the @xmath2-soliton solutions moves at a constant speed throughout a collision .",
    "our main results are obtained in section  [ results ] . for overtake and head - on collisions described by the @xmath2-soliton solutions ,",
    "we first show that the net effect of a collision is to shift the asymptotic positions and phases of the two waves while the speed and the temporal frequency of each wave remains unchanged .",
    "explicit formulas for these asymptotic shifts are presented in terms of the speeds and temporal frequencies of the two waves in the collision .",
    "next , from these formulas , we find that for overtake collisions the faster wave gets shifted forward relative to its direction of motion while the slower or stationary wave gets shifted in the backward direction .",
    "in contrast , for head - on collisions , we find that both waves get shifted forward relative to their directions of motion . finally , for all collisions",
    ", we show that the position shifts of the two oscillatory waves are related by the property that the center of momentum of the waves is preserved in the collision .    in section",
    "[ interactions ] , we discuss a few interesting features of the nonlinear interactions that occur for oscillatory waves and standing waves during collisions , such as the appearance of nodes , phase coils , and phase reversals .",
    "we also make some concluding remarks .    previous work on soliton solutions of the hirota equation and sasa - satsuma equation appears in .",
    "this work amounts to deriving the @xmath1-soliton and @xmath2-soliton formulas in a mathematically equivalent but less physically useful envelope form , without any analysis of the asymptotic behaviour and the constants of motion for these solutions .",

    "the main results stated in theorems  [ thm : hshift ] and  [ thm : ssshift ] on the properties of collisions described by oscillatory @xmath2-solitons , carry over directly to the third - order nls equation .",
    "in particular , the net effect of a collision is to shift the asymptotic positions and phases of the individual oscillatory waves while the speed and the temporal frequency of each wave remains unchanged , such that the center of momentum of the waves is preserved in the collision .",
