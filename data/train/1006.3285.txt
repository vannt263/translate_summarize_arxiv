    "the study of legendrian knots in standard contact @xmath6 up to the equivalence relation of legendrian isotopy provides an interesting variation on the classical theory of smooth knots in @xmath7-space .",
    "each smooth knot type has legendrian representatives .",
    "however , legendrian knots of the same underlying smooth knot type need not be equivalent as legendrian knots .",
    "there are two ` classical invariants ' capable of distinguishing between legendrian knots with the same underlying smooth knot type .",
    "they are known as the thurston - bennequin number , @xmath8 , and rotation number , @xmath9 . beginning in the late 1990 s ,",
    "several stronger invariants of legendrian knots have been developed .",
    "of particular interest for this article are invariants arising from counts of certain decompositions of front diagrams known as normal rulings .",
    "normal rulings arose independently in the work of fuchs @xcite in connection with augmentations of the chekanov - eliashberg dga and also in the work of chekanov and pushkar @xcite who were motivated by generating families .",
    "chekanov and pushkar defined for each divisor @xmath10 of @xmath11 an invariant which can be neatly encoded as the @xmath10-graded ruling polynomial , @xmath12 .",
    "a particularly elegant aspect of legendrian knot theory is the interplay between legendrian invariants and invariants of the underlying smooth knot type .",
    "for instance , the values of the classical invariants are constrained by invariants which depend only on the smooth knot type via ` bennequin type inequalities ' ( see for instance @xcite ) . as an example ,",
    "fuchs and tabachnikov @xcite proved that for any legendrian link @xmath0 in standard contact @xmath6 @xmath13 where @xmath14 $ ] is the homfly - pt polynomial is normalized so that the unknot has the value @xmath15 .",

    ", legendrian knots can shed light on topological knot invariants .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the coefficient of @xmath16 in @xmath17 is precisely @xmath4 , and hence may be viewed as counting @xmath3-graded normal rulings .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to investigate the relationship between @xmath3-graded normal rulings and the homfly - pt polynomial of legendrian links in the @xmath1-jet space of the circle , @xmath18 .",

    ", annular link diagrams can not always be reduced to a multiple of the unknot via repeated applications of the skein relations .",
    "instead there are sequences of oriented diagrams @xmath19 whose products ( defined by stacking , see section 2 ) form the base cases for evaluating @xmath20 .",

    "the summands are determined by the entries of the matrix .    in the literature , there is a traditional way of identifying @xmath35 with the algebra , @xmath36 , of symmetric functions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the discussion in section 5.1 ) where the schur functions @xmath37 correspond to skein elements @xmath38 .",

    "our method for proving theorem  [ maint ] is inductive as in @xcite , but several interesting complications arise . for starters , a more subtle measure of the complexity of a front diagram is required and an additional algorithm is necessary to reduce the complexity of front diagrams lacking cusps .",
    "more notably , the base case for the induction needs to be enlarged to include all products of legendrian versions of the @xmath23 .",
    "an interesting wrinkle occurs here .",
    "in contrast to the case of smooth link diagrams , the product of legendrian front diagrams in the annulus is not commutative .",

    "we provide many further examples by showing that for any @xmath45 the locations of disjoint @xmath23 and @xmath46 in the @xmath47 direction can not be interchanged by a legendrian isotopy",
    ". nevertheless , we are able to establish in lemma  [ lem : commute ] that the @xmath3-graded ruling polynomial of a product of the @xmath23 does not depend on the ordering of the factors .",
    "we ve included at the end of section 6 a proof of chmutov and goryunov s estimate ( theorem  [ chmutov ] ) .",
    "the homfly - pt polynomials used here and in @xcite differ in a significant way ( see section 6.2 ) . while we believe that these two versions of @xmath20 should provide the same estimate for @xmath48 , it is straight forward to provide a proof of theorem  [ chmutov ] from scratch .",
    "our proof is based on the inductive method used in the proof of theorem  [ maint ] and is similar in spirit to ng s approach to bennequin type inequalities in @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "if @xmath518 we can apply the skein move @xmath264 times to obtain @xmath519 which is stabilized .      in @xcite a contactomorphism @xmath520 is used to treat legendrian links as co - oriented plane curves , and their proof of theorem  [ chmutov ] is carried out in this context .",
    "however , the version of @xmath20 used in @xcite differs from ours in a non - trivial manner as the annulus within @xmath18 which is used there for link projections differs from ours by a full twist .",
    "we conclude by giving a proof of theorem  [ chmutov ] matching our conventions .",
    "our proof uses the front projection perspective and is based on the inductive method used in the proof of lemma  [ lem : mainl ] .",
    "this is similar to the approach to bennequin type inequalities in @xmath6 appearing in @xcite .",
    "first , observe that for a legendrian link @xmath51 the inequality @xmath521 is equivalent to @xmath522 here , @xmath380 is computed using the front projection of @xmath0 , and @xmath402 denotes the number of right cusps appearing in the front projection .",
    "observe that this inequality trivially hold for products of the @xmath23 as both sides equal @xmath5 .",
    "we now establish ( [ eq : altest ] ) for a general front diagram @xmath440 by induction on @xmath448 .",
    "the base case is covered by the previous remark .      as in the proof of lemma  [ lem : mainl ] , after a legendrian isotopy either @xmath440 becomes a product of basic fronts , or we can modify @xmath440 to a front diagram @xmath452 containing @xmath454 . in the latter case , use the homfly - pt relations ( i ) and ( ii ) to compute @xmath523 as @xmath524 where exactly one of @xmath414 and @xmath415 is non - zero depending on the orientation of @xmath452 . denote the @xmath7 front diagrams appearing on the rhs as @xmath525 , @xmath526 , and @xmath527 . in general , @xmath528 and @xmath529 . also , if @xmath530 ( resp .",
    "@xmath531 ) then @xmath532 ( resp .",
    "@xmath533 ) .",
    "thus , the inductive hypothesis applies to deduce that both non - zero terms on the rhs of ( [ eq : pf ] ) have degree in @xmath246 less than or equal to @xmath534 .      provided",
    "the inductive hypothesis applies to fronts of lesser word area ( [ eq : altest ] ) holds for a front containing @xmath535 if and only if it holds for the front @xmath536 obtained from a skein move .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ lem : mainl ] contains an algorithm which makes use of a combination of word area preserving legendrian isotopies and skein moves to reduce the word area of @xmath440 or arrange the front diagram to contain a stabilization or a disjoint unknot component . in the latter two cases ,",
    "proceed as follows :    * 1 . *",
    "if @xmath440 contains a stabilization the inductive hypothesis will apply to the front diagram @xmath537 obtained from removing the pair of cusps .",
    "we have @xmath538 where the sign depends on the orientation of @xmath440 .",
