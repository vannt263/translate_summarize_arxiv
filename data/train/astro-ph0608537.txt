    "galactic outflows are observed to carry mass and metals into the intergalactic medium  ( e.g. @xcite ) . at high redshift , outflows are ubiquitous from star - forming galaxies  ( @xcite ) , and the metals that they carry are seen in a wide range of environments ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite originally noted the missing metals problem , namely that the amount of metals present in lyman break galaxies at @xmath4 falls far short of the amount expected to be produced by their stars ( see @xcite for an updated discussion ) .",
    "hence outflows appear to have a large impact on the evolution of galaxies during the heydey of star formation in the universe , and metals provide a convenient avenue with which to trace and quantify ejected gas .",
    "in @xcite ( hereafter od06 ) we implemented a number of parameterized models for galactic outflows into gadget-2  cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we tested these models against observations of quasar absorption line systems at @xmath5 , and found that only a relatively narrow range of outflow parameters were capable of enriching the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) early enough while not overheating it .",
    "intriguingly , the most successful models were ones that employed a momentum - driven wind scenario  ( @xcite ) that is also favored by local observations of starburst outflows  ( @xcite ) . hence it is plausible that distant outflow - driving galaxies obey scalings similar to local ones",
    ".    another critical test of such outflow models is measuring the metals that get left behind in galaxies rather than driven into the igm .",
    "observationally , this can be traced using the galaxy mass - metallicity relation .",
    "@xcite , using the sloan digital sky survey , found that low - redshift emission - line galaxies had a gas - phase metallicity that increased with stellar mass up to @xmath6 , and then flattened to higher masses . at @xmath7 ,",
    "smaller survey areas make it difficult to track the high - mass flattening , but indications are that galaxies at a given mass are only mildly underenriched compared to present - day ones  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this evolution was extended out to @xmath8 by @xcite , who found that galaxies back then are roughly one - half as metal - rich as galaxies today at a given stellar mass .",
    "this is mildly surprising as only about one - quarter of all stars ( and therefore , presumably , metals ) have formed by then  ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , most models of cosmic chemical evolution predict earlier enrichment in the highly biased environments that form early stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in any case , if the solution to the missing metals problem is that the majority of metals have been ejected from galaxies  ( e.g. @xcite ) , then the amount and distribution of metals left behind in galaxies likely offers key insights into the nature of outflows .",
    "in these proceedings we test our outflow models in od06 against the @xmath1 mass - metallicity data of @xcite , and study the evolution of the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "we show that the same outflow model that best matches the igm data also best matches the mass - metallicity relation , and furthermore the models that do not match the igm data provide a poorer fit .",
    "this lends further support to the idea that momentum - driven galactic winds in a hierarchical galaxy formation setting can explain a wide range of observables at @xmath9 .",
    "we employ the suite of gadget-2  cosmological hydrodynamic simulations described in od06 .",
    "briefly , these use the entropy - conservative pm - tree - sph code gadget-2  ( @xcite ) with improvements as described in od06 including metal - line cooling .",
    "an @xmath10 @xmath11cdm cosmology was assumed , and cubic random volumes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 on a side were represented with @xmath14 particles ( the @xmath15 runs are not useful for the present study ) .",
    "the minimum resolved galaxy stellar masses in these runs , corresponding to 64 star particles , are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .    for conciseness , we focus on three of the six outflow models in od06 :  no winds \" ( nw ) ,  constant winds \" ( cw ) , and  momentum - driven winds \" ( vzw ) . the no winds case is shown for illustrative purposes , the constant winds case is the outflow model in the runs of @xcite , and the vzw momentum - driven winds case is the one that , overall , best matches the igm metal line observations .",
    "the mzw momentum - driven model of od06 gives very similar results to vzw , and vzw seems mildly more plausible based on observations of local starburst outflows  ( @xcite ) . as a reminder",
    ", vzw assumes @xmath18 and mass loading factor @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the galaxy velocity dispersion ) , while cw assumes @xmath21  km / s and @xmath22 for all galaxies .    to compare to the mass - metallicity relation observed in galaxies",
    ", we calculate the star formation rate ( sfr)-weighted metallicity of gas particles in galaxies identified in our simulations .",
    "this weighting is intended to emulate how galaxy metallicities are typically measured , using nebular emission lines that arise from warm ionized gas in star forming regions . in @xcite",
    ", gas masses are obtained from star formation rates using the kennicutt relation together with the h@xmath23 radius , whereas in our simulations gas masses are obtained as bound cold , dense gas .",
    "these measures are quite different and their relation is unclear , and further there are possible systematics in both simulations and data , so we caution that comparisons to gas mass relations are highly preliminary .",
    "on the other hand , comparisons to the stellar mass - metallicity relation should be reasonably robust , and that will be the main focus of these proceedings .",
    "red and green points show @xmath24 and @xmath13 box galaxies , respectively .",
    "data points shown are from @xcite ; the thick solid line in the left panels is the median @xmath0 relation at @xmath25 from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : metcomp],title=\"fig:\",width=415 ] -0.6 in    -0.1 in    figure  [ fig : metcomp ] shows galaxy metallicities versus stellar mass ( left panels ) and gas mass ( right panels ) , for the vzw , cw , and nw models ( top to bottom ) . overplotted are data points from @xcite and the median stellar mass - metallicity relation in sdss from @xcite ( solid line ) .",
    "the @xmath25 relation is shifted up by about @xmath26 in metallicity at a given stellar mass but has a similar slope , as noted in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : metcomp ] demonstrates , at its most basic level , that the outflow model has a significant impact on the mass - metallicity relation . therefore both the slope and the amplitude of this relation provide critical constraints on outflows . if no outflows are included ( nw model ) , not only are too many stars produced ( see e.g. od06 ) , but too many of the metals remain locked into galaxies at a given stellar mass . hence not only are outflows required to enrich the igm , they are concurrently required to _ de-_enrich galaxies .",
    "comparing our two outflow models reveals some interesting and perhaps surprising insights into the nature of the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "given that the constant wind ( cw ) model ( middle panels ) assumes a constant outflow velocity of @xmath27  km / s , one might expect a characteristic feature in the @xmath0 relation corresponding to halos of this escape velocity ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "in particular , halos above that mass should have a flat @xmath0 relation ( because they produce metals in proportion to their stellar content ) , while below that mass there should be a slope arising from the fact that outflows can escape more easily from smaller halos .",
    "indeed , the overall shape of the local @xmath0 relation has been qualitatively explained using such a scenario .",
    "however , at face value , the trend produced in the cw model is exactly the opposite : at low masses , there is a constant @xmath0 relation , while at @xmath29 it begins to rise sharply .",
    "why does this happen ?",
    "the answer is not entirely clear .",
    "a preliminary idea that we are now investigating is that because the constant wind model so widely enriches the igm at an early epoch ( see od06 , figure  10 ) , it _",
    "pre - pollutes _ the gas out of which the smaller galaxies later form .",
    "in fact , the smallest galaxies forming most recently actually have a slightly higher metallicity , i.e. there is an inversion in @xmath0 at low masses , because the igm becomes more enriched overall with time .",
    "this suggests that environmental effects and clustering must also be taken into account when interpreting mass - metallicity relations .",
    "it is also worth noting that , although the @xmath1 data at @xmath30 are too uncertain to definitively rule out such a flattening at low masses , locally the @xmath0 slope is seen to continue relatively unbroken to quite small masses  ( @xcite ) , which would clearly rule out such a high level of pre - pollution .",
    "next , there is the issues of the slope of the @xmath0 relation at @xmath29 ; it is far too steep compared with observations , agreeing at @xmath31 but being a factor of two too high by @xmath32 .",
    "hence a constant outflow velocity actually produces an incorrect @xmath0 slope by being over - efficient at expelling metals from small galaxies as compared to large ones .",
    "this favors a scenario where smaller galaxies have smaller outflow velocities . at some large mass ,",
    "the cw model is expected to produce a flattened @xmath0 slope , but halos with an escape velocity of @xmath33  km / s are rare within our volume by @xmath34 so it is not apparent here",
    ".    the vzw model ( top left panel ) agrees quite well with observations , matching both the observed slope and the amplitude at @xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude agreement reflects a proper balance between metals retained in galaxies and expelled into the igm , and is related to the fact that vzw broadly reproduces the stellar mass density evolution .",
    "the agreement in the slope , more interestingly , may be indicating that _ galaxies lose a fixed fraction of their expelled material .",
    "_ this is precisely the scenario in the vzw model because the outflow speed scales with the escape velocity , and hence all halos ( to first order ) lose material equally efficiently .",
    "it also happens in the no - wind case , in the sense that the fraction lost is essentially zero for all galaxies , and despite its other failings it does reproduce the slope of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "outflow models like cw , where small galaxies lose a higher fraction of their expelled material , result in too steep a slope .",
    "interestingly , @xcite finds that observationally there is no evidence that small galaxies at @xmath1 have preferentially lost more of their baryons as compared to more massive ones .",
    "turning to the gas mass - metallicity relation ( right panels ) , the observations span a rather limited range in gas mass , and both cw and vzw are in broad agreement with data given the level of uncertainties discussed earlier . in contrast , with no outflows the gas is too quickly converted into stars , leaving no objects with gas masses as observed .",
    "this shows that outflows are required in order to keep galaxies as gas - rich as observed at these epochs .",
    "the predicted trends in metallicity versus gas mass and versus stellar mass are similar , which reflects the steady conversion of gas into stars in simulations .    in summary , comparisons of various outflow models to the stellar mass - metallicity relation of galaxies",
    "shows that outflows must be strong enough to eject significant amounts of metals , but not be so strong as to over - pollute the diffuse igm out of which later galaxies form .",
    "the slope of the mass - metallicity relationship suggests that galaxies should lose a fixed fraction of their outflowing metals to the igm , favoring a scenario where the outflow speed scales as the escape velocity .",
    "it is fairly remarkable that our momentum - driven wind model naturally produces the correct strength and scaling of outflows in order to reproduce the observed @xmath0 relation .",
    "it is even more remarkable when one considers that this model is fairly uniquely succesful at enriching the igm to observed levels at these epochs , and suggests that such models are on the right track towards understanding the basic scaling relations of outflows at all epochs .",
    "-0.5 in   ( top to bottom ) . @xmath24 box is shown as red points , @xmath13 box as green points ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "data points shown are from @xcite ; the thick solid line in the left panels is the median @xmath0 relation at @xmath25 from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : mzevol],title=\"fig:\",width=415 ] -0.6 in    -0.1 in    figure  [ fig : mzevol ] shows galaxy metallicities versus stellar mass ( left panels ) and gas mass ( right panels ) , at @xmath36 ( top to bottom ) from the vzw model .",
    "the amplitude of the mass - metallicity relation in this model evolves slowly , with galaxies already being substantially enriched by @xmath37  ( @xcite ) , while the slope is set early on and remains esentially constant at @xmath38 ( in agreement with the @xmath39 determination by @xcite ) .",
    "a simple linear time - based extrapolation from @xmath40 indicates that this model would be very close to matching the @xmath25 data from @xcite .",
    "the increase in amplitude is about 0.06  dex per gyr from @xmath2 . at @xmath3",
    "this extrapolation would predict [ z / h]@xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "however , a linear extrapolation may not be appropriate given that outflows are likely less prevalant at low-@xmath43 .",
    "it is also worth putting in a cautionary note about systematics in observed metallicity indicators ; commonly - used indicators may differ by @xmath44 from the true gas - phase metallicity  ( @xcite ) , so one must be cautious not to over - interpret the precise values .    overall , it is interesting that galaxies seem to move towards higher masses predominantly _ along _ the @xmath0 relation .",
    "the slope of this relation ( @xmath45 ) , does not appear to have a natural physical explanation .",
    "although @xcite interpreted it in terms of a leaky closed box model , such a scenario seems overly simplistic , as it does not incorporate hierarchical growth and environmental effects , both of which are important in our simulations for establishing the @xmath0 relation .",
    "instead , the slope probably reflects some particular balance between outflows and galaxy growth , further emphasizing that the slope , amplitude , and evolution of the mass - metallicity relation all provide critical tests of outflow models .",
    "using our cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating galactic outflows , we investigate the nature of the mass - metallicity relation in galaxies at high redshift , and compare it to @xmath1 observations by @xcite .",
    "we find that :    * outflows are required in order to reduce the metallicity of galaxies at @xmath34 . with no outflows , galaxies at a given stellar mass are twice as enriched as they should be by that epoch , comparable to galaxies today .",
    "* the slope and amplitude of the @xmath0 relation is naturally reproduced in our momentum - driven wind model that is also favored from comparisons to igm enrichment observations from @xmath46 . *",
    "the constant wind - speed outflow model produces an @xmath0 relation that is flat at low masses , possibly owing to pre - pollution from early widespread winds , and rises too steeply at high masses , both of which are in disagreement with observations .",
    "hence it does not appear that smaller galaxies preferentially lose more material to outflows at these epochs .",
    "* the mass - metallicity slope is established at early times ( @xmath47 ) and remains constant at @xmath38 , while the amplitude evolves slowly with redshift ( @xmath48  dex per gyr ) .",
    "galaxies tend to evolve mostly along the @xmath0 relation towards higher stellar masses . * a simple , albeit questionable , extrapolation to @xmath3 yields a relation that is in good agreement with data from  @xcite .",
    "the unbroken slope to the lowest observed masses  ( @xcite ) provides another non - trivial constraint that is met in our momentum - driven wind scenario .    in summary , the mass - metallicity relation provides another critical constraint on galactic outflows across cosmic time . understanding the complex processes that establish the shape and evolution of the @xmath0 relation",
    "will likely require moving beyond simple closed box model variants , and may benefit from insights gained using numerical simulations that include metal production and distribution mechanisms .",
    "the comparisons here strengthen our claim that momentum - driven wind scalings ( whether or not they actually arise from momentum - driven winds ) are able to properly distribute metals throughout the universe at high redshfits .    99 cen , r. & ostriker , j. p. 1999 , apj , 519 , l109 dav , r. , finlator , k. , & oppenheimer , b. d. 2006 , mnras , in press , astro - ph/0511532 dav , r. & oppenheimer , b. d. 2006 , mnras , submitted , astro - ph/0608268 ellison , s. l. , kewley , l. j. , malln - ornelas , g. 2005 , mnras , 357 , 354 erb , d. k. , shapley , a. e. , pettini , m. , steidel , c. c. , reddy , n. a , & adelberger , k. l. 2006 , apj , accepted , astro - ph/0602473 lee , h. et al .",
