    "the dynamics of quantum correlations of the system under multilocal coupling with dephasing environment are shown in figure figure1@xmath77 .",
    "the blue ( dotted @xmath75 ) and the green ( dashed - dotted @xmath78 ) curves represent the behavior of entanglement .",
    "we see that for small values of @xmath74 the entanglement sudden death occurs very quickly and there is no entanglement at all for large values of @xmath74 .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath74 , the discord ( black ( solid ) and red ( dashed ) curves ) is always larger than the entanglement and exists in the system beyond the instant at which entanglement loss has taken place . the solid curve ( @xmath75 )",
    "shows that in the presence of multilocal environment the discord monotonically decreases without being freezed for any interval .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows the dynamics of quantum correlations in multilocal coupling for the same two values of @xmath74 against the dimensionless parameter @xmath79 , which defines the qutrit s local environment . unlike the effect of qubit s environment on the dynamics of discord ( solid and dashed curves ) , we see that neither there is instantaneous decay nor the decay is as fast as in figure [ figure1]@xmath80 .",
    "most importantly , for @xmath81 ( dashed curve ) the discord is static initially , then abruptly increases , and remains almost static for the rest of the time .",
    "this behavior shows the robustness of discord against the local coupling of the qutrit marginal system with its environment .",
    "in fact , this is not only the case with discord , a comparison with figure [ figure1]@xmath80 shows that entanglement ( dashed and dash - dotted curves ) is also comparatively robust in this setup .",

    "one can note that regardless of which marginal system is coupled to its local environment , the loss of entanglement is qualitatively identical .",
    "the same is true for quantum discord in the limit of large values of the plotting parameters .",
    "however , in the range of small values of @xmath86 , the behavior of quantum discord strongly depends on which marginal system is coupled to its local environment .",
    "the qubit s environment initially generates nonclassical correlations in the system that grow smoothly and then monotonically decays reaching zero in the asymptotic limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of qutrit s environment causes nonanalytic changes in discord .",
    "initially it causes discord to monotonically decay reaching a minimum , abruptly increases at a critical time reaching a maximum , again start decreasing monotonically and then adopting behavior similar to the case of qubit coupling with its environment as mentioned above . since discord is a continuous function of the plotting parameters , the abrupt increase in its dynamics at a critical point may results due to the spontaneous generated coherence between the two excited level of the qutrit system .",
    "the same argument applies to the generation of dicord in figure [ figure2 ] and figure [ figure4 ] as discussed next .",
    "another notable aspect is the complete loss of quantum discord in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the amplitude damping noise transforms the initial quantum state into a classical - quantum state void of nonclassical correlations when coupled with the system for long enough time .",
    "a more or less similar behavior of quantum correlation is noted for @xmath76 which is shown in figure [ figure3]@xmath80 .    in figure",
    "[ figure4]@xmath87 , we plot the behaviors of quantum correlation in the presence of multilocal environments for the same two values of @xmath74 .",
    "it can be seen that overall the qualitative behavior of quantum correlations in the presence multilocal environments is unchanged , however , the peaks height of quantum discord are considerably reduced . secondly , for both values of @xmath74 the quantum discord plotted against decay constant of qutrit s environment",
    "is either large or equal to the one plotted against the decay constant of qubit s environment .",
    "in this paper we report the influence of noise on the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord in a one parameter qubit - qutrit systems .",
    "in particular , we have considered the effects of phase damping and amplitude damping noises in the kruas operator formalism .",
    "although the results are discussed in detail in section @xmath88 , we summarize our findings in this section .",
    "we have analytically demonstrated that both the one way and two ways coupling of the environments with the system cause entanglement sudden death . the quantum discord and hence the nonclassical correlations survives when the system evolves under dephasing noise even in the asymptomatic limit .",
    "we find that quantum discord not only show robustness in coupling with qutrit s dephasing noise but can also be generated by the qutrit s dephasing noise when each marginal system is locally coupled to its own dephasing noise . on the other hand , it is found that in two ways coupling discord is very fragile against the qubit s environment . under such coupling ,",
    "the invariance and freezing behavior of quantum discord become conditional . in the case of amplitude damping noise , the behavior of entanglement is identical in both one way and two ways coupling of the marginal systems .",
    "however , the dynamics of quantum discord strongly depends on which marginal system is coupled locally to the environment .",
