    "@xmath5 is the minimum dimension @xmath0 , such that @xmath4 is representable as the intersection graph of boxes in @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "roberts @xcite introduced the concept of boxicity .",
    "its applications include niche overlap ( competition ) in ecology and problems of fleet maintenance in operations research .",
    "cozzens @xcite showed that computing the boxicity of a graph is np - hard .",
    "this was later strengthened by yannakakis @xcite and finally , by kratochvil @xcite , who showed that deciding whether boxicity of a graph is at most 2 itself is np - complete .",
    "the class of graphs with boxicity at most 1 is exactly the popular class of _ interval graphs_. a graph @xmath34 is an interval graph if there exists a mapping , say @xmath45 , from @xmath35 to intervals on the real line such that two vertices in @xmath4 are adjacent if and only if the intervals to which they are mapped overlap .",
    "@xmath45 is called an _ interval representation _ of @xmath4 .",
    "given a graph @xmath34 , let @xmath46 be a set of @xmath23 interval graphs such that @xmath47 .",
    "then , we say that @xmath48 is an _ interval graph representation _ of @xmath4 .",
    "the concept of boxicity can be equivalently formulated using the interval graph representation as follows :    * ( roberts @xcite ) * the minimum @xmath23 such that there exists an interval graph representation of @xmath4 using @xmath23 interval graphs @xmath46 is the same as @xmath5 .",
    "there have been several attempts to establish upper bounds on boxicity , especially for graphs with special structures .",
    "roberts , in his seminal work @xcite , proved that the boxicity of a complete @xmath23-partite graph is @xmath23 , thereby showing that boxicity of a graph with @xmath6 vertices can not exceed @xmath49 .",

    "scheinerman @xcite showed that the boxicity of outer planar graphs is at most 2 .",
    "thomassen @xcite proved that the boxicity of planar graphs is at most 3 . in @xcite , cozzens and roberts studied the boxicity of split graphs .",
    "in contrast , the literature provides few results regarding lower bounds on boxicity .",
    "even ad hoc constructions that achieve high boxicity are rare . in @xcite , to prove that a complete @xmath23-partite graph has boxicity at least @xmath23 , roberts uses the pigeon - hole principle in conjunction with the fact that an interval graph does not contain an induced @xmath57 . as a consequence",
    ", he shows that the boxicity of a @xmath58-partite graph is at least @xmath49 . in @xcite trotter",
    "has characterized all graphs with boxicity @xmath49 .",
    "similar arguments are used by cozzens and roberts @xcite to show that the boxicity of the complement of a cycle or a path of length @xmath6 , is at least @xmath59 .",
    "motivated by the concept of boxicity , mckee and scheinerman @xcite study a parameter called _ chordality _ of a graph @xmath4 , @xmath60 ( a better name would be chordal dimension ) .",
    "it is the minimum @xmath23 such that @xmath4 can be expressed as the intersection of @xmath23 chordal graphs .",
    "since , every interval graph is chordal , it follows that @xmath61 . to obtain lower bounds for chordality , the authors use the property that",
    "if a graph has chordality at most @xmath23 , then @xmath4 contains a vertex whose neighbours induce a subgraph of chordality at most @xmath62 . using this ,",
    "they have managed to show that the chordality and hence the boxicity of a bipyramid graph is at least @xmath63 .",
    "unfortunately , it does not look like it is adequate to give strong and general lower bounds . in @xcite , chandran and sivadasan provide a specialized construction to show that for any integer @xmath64 , there are graphs with treewidth at most @xmath65 whose boxicity is at least @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to note that coloring problems on low boxicity graphs were considered as early as 1948 @xcite .",
    "kostochka @xcite provides an extensive survey on colouring problems of intersection graphs . in @xcite , the complexity of finding the maximum independent set in bounded boxicity graphs",
    "is considered .",
    "researchers have also tried to generalize or extend the concept of boxicity in various ways .",
    "the poset boxicity @xcite , the rectangle number @xcite , grid dimension @xcite , circular dimension @xcite , and the boxicity of digraphs @xcite are some examples .      in this paper , we present two methods to obtain lower bounds on boxicity .",
    "the underlying idea of both the methods is to make use of the vertex isoperimetric properties of the given graph ( sometimes modified to suit our purpose ) .",
    "the first method allows us to derive strong lower bounds , but has the drawback that it is not of much use when there is a large independent set in the graph ( consider for example , the case of bipartite graphs ) .",
    "but the second method overcomes this difficulty and is much more general , though the lower bounds derivable using it seem to be relatively weaker for comparable cases . most of the already known lower bounds can be re - derived using these methods . applying these methods",
    "we derive several new results , some of which are listed below :    1 .",
    "the boxicity of a graph on @xmath6 vertices with no universal vertices and minimum degree @xmath7 is at least @xmath8 ( theorem [ thm : universal ] , section [ sec : consmainthm ] ) .",
    "+ there are two parameters , namely _",
    "cubicity _ and _ sphericity _ which are closely related to boxicity .",
    "there have been several instances in the literature when these two parameters were compared with each other .",
    "cubicity ( sphericity ) of @xmath4 denoted as @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is the minimum dimension @xmath0 , such that @xmath4 can be represented as the intersection graph of axis - parallel unit cubes ( unit spheres ) in @xmath0-dimensional space . since cubicity is a stricter notion of boxicity , @xmath69",
    "apparently , there is no such relationship between cubicity ( or boxicity ) and sphericity .",
    "+ havel @xcite showed that there are graphs with sphericity 2 and arbitrarily high cubicity while fishburn @xcite constructed some graphs of cubicity at most 3 with sphericity greater than their cubicity .",
    "maehara et al @xcite proved that the sphericity of the complement of a tree is at most 3 . using our result",
    "mentioned above , we can easily infer that if @xmath4 is the complement of a bounded degree tree , then @xmath70 .",
    "thus we have a large number of graphs that have arbitrarily higher value of boxicity ( not just cubicity ! ) than their sphericity .",
    "this is a much stronger result compared to that of havel s , who refers to the class of star graphs ( consider the five  pointed star graph @xmath71 : @xmath72 while @xmath73 .",
    "but the boxicity of any star graph is 1 ) .",
    "2 .   consider the @xmath9 model of random graphs .",
    "let @xmath10 be such that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are predetermined constants . then , for @xmath14 , almost surely @xmath15 ( theorem [ thm : randthm ] , section [ sec : rand1 ] ) .",
    "+ on setting @xmath16 we immediately infer that almost all graphs have boxicity @xmath17 . another consequence of this result is as follows : let @xmath18 be an integer such that @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is a suitable constant ) .",
    "then , there exists a constant @xmath21 such that almost all graphs on @xmath6 vertices and exactly @xmath18 edges have boxicity at least @xmath22 .",

    ". then , the boxicity of @xmath4 is at least @xmath74 ( theorem [ thm : spec ] , section [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "+ bilu and linial @xcite have a similar result for sphericity of regular graphs .",
    "they prove that an @xmath75-regular graph of order @xmath6 , with bounded diameter has sphericity @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a constant .",
    "note that if @xmath4 is an @xmath75-regular graph , the lower bound for boxicity that we get is almost the square of the bilu - linial bound for sphericity .",
    "the boxicity of random @xmath23-regular graphs on @xmath6 vertices ( where @xmath23 is fixed ) is @xmath26 ( corollary [ cor : specalmost ] , section [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "+ this lower bound should be compared with the known upper bound of @xmath78 from @xcite .",
    "hence , we see that for @xmath23-regular graphs the lower bound and upper bound become comparable .",
    "it is conjectured in @xcite that the upper bound may come down to @xmath79 and therefore for @xmath23-regular graphs to @xmath80 .",
    "it may be true that the correct lower bound is indeed @xmath81 and not @xmath26 .",
