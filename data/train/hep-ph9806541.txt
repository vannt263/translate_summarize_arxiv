    "many years ago feynman issued the following challenge@xcite : `` it seems that very little physical intuition has yet been developed in this subject [ of quantum electrodynamics ] . in nearly every case",
    "we are reduced to computing exactly the coefficient of some specific term .",
    "we have no way to get a general idea of the result to be expected .   as a specific challenge , is there any method of computing the anomalous moment of the electron which , on first rough approximation , gives a rough approximation to the @xmath2 term and a crude one to @xmath3 ; and when improved , increases the accuracy of the @xmath3 term , yielding a rough estimate to @xmath4 and beyond ? ''",
    "this challenge was taken up by drell and pagels@xcite , who used a sideways dispersion relation and low - energy theorems for compton scattering@xcite to construct consistency conditions for the anomalous moment .",
    "their approach did meet with some success , particularly in understanding the sign of the @xmath2 term ; however , the dispersion relation requires an ultraviolet cutoff , and low - energy approximations of the integrand are not completely adequate .",
    "we propose to meet feynman s challenge by using discretized light - cone@xcite quantization@xcite ( dlcq)@xcite . by constructing the dressed electron state in fock space we can in principle",
    "compute physical properties of the electron exactly@xcite . in practice ,",
    "various truncations are required , but the approach remains nonperturbative . instead of producing an expansion in @xmath2 , we produce an expansion in fock particles , _",
    "i.e_.  the number of photons in flight .",
    "the computation is equivalent to a selective summation of graphs to all orders , but is actually done by diagonalizing a matrix approximation of the light - cone mass - squared operator . in this form",
    "the calculation becomes a testing ground for techniques of nonperturbative renormalization .",
    "when two - photon intermediate states are allowed , graphs such as the multiloop graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : samplegraphs](a ) enter the calculation and are summed to all orders . even at the one - photon level ,",
    "the calculation is nonperturbative because there are infinite - order contributions from graphs of the sort in fig .",
    "[ fig : samplegraphs](b ) and ( c ) . however , in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : samplegraphs](c ) , crossed - photon graphs and z graphs are needed to cancel a divergence at zero longitudinal momentum for any instantaneous electron .",
    "because of these cancellations , we place the nonperturbative part of the one - photon contribution into a two - photon calculation .",
    "=    the selection of the graphs to be summed is driven by the truncations made and is designed to make the calculation tractable .",
    "the truncation in particle number is physically reasonable ; the work of drell and pagels@xcite shows that states with few photons in flight are dominant . as the actual number of particles is varied and",
    "as different truncations of the interactions are explored , one can gain a better understanding of the physics of the anomalous moment .",
    "thus our calculation can be viewed as the beginning of a possible program , with systematic improvements available .",
    "it might even become a model for how to proceed with nonperturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .    in the work presented here we regulate the theory by an invariant - mass cutoff , which limits the light - cone energy of the fock states included in the basis , and by a tamm - dancoff truncation@xcite of the number of constituents .",
    "these restrictions keep the numerical calculation to a very reasonable size but they do complicate the renormalization .",
    "the truncations turn the bare parameters of the theory into fock - sector dependent functions of momentum@xcite and require careful construction of appropriate counterterms@xcite to correctly approximate the solution to the original theory@xcite .",
    "we fix these functions by applying conditions on mass eigenvalues and vertices in the presence of spectator constituents .",
    "two alternative renormalization procedures now exist .",
    "one is the similarity transformation developed by wilson and gazek@xcite and wegner@xcite , where counterterms are generated perturbatively as the hamiltonian matrix is narrowed in the range of allowed light - cone energies ; the final hamiltonian matrix is used nonperturbatively .",
    "this approach has been applied by perry and co - workers@xcite .",
    "the other is based on introduction of pauli ",
    "villars regulators@xcite before the quantization and numerical schemes are selected , so that counterterms can be supplied simply by adjusting the bare parameters .",
    "this approach has just recently been successfully tested in a simple model@xcite , and it should soon be considered for the anomalous - moment problem studied here .",
    "we compute the anomalous moment@xcite from a spin - flip matrix element of the plus component of the electromagnetic current@xcite .",
    "we approximate the fock - state expansion of the dressed electron with a truncation to no more than two photons and one electron .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for the wave functions becomes a coupled set of three integral equations . to construct these equations",
    "we use the light - cone hamiltonian derived by tang _",
    "et al_.@xcite , regulated by the invariant - mass cutoff .",
    "the photon mass is taken to be one tenth of the electron mass , to help control infrared divergences .",
    "the coupling strength is set at @xmath5 , because limitations on numerical accuracy make nonperturbative effects discernible only at large coupling .",
    "the calculation is not an attempt to compete with the accuracy of the perturbative calculations by kinoshita and co - workers@xcite .",
    "the bare electron mass in the one - photon sector is computed from the one - loop correction allowed by the two - photon states , where one photon is a spectator .",
    "we then require that the bare mass in the no - photon sector be such that physical mass is an eigenvalue of the light - cone hamiltonian .",
    "the three - point bare coupling is also sector dependent .",
    "there are no vacuum polarization effects , because pair production is removed by the tamm ",
    "dancoff truncation .",
    "however , the truncation violates the ward identity so that vertex and wave function renormalization do not cancel@xcite .",
    "a consequence of this is that the physical coupling is limited to a cutoff - dependent finite range of allowed values .",
    "we compute the critical coupling that defines the upper limit .",
    "the vertex renormalization is fixed by considering the proper part of the transition amplitude for photon absorption by an electron at zero photon momentum .",
    "a means by which this transition amplitude can be computed from the lowest eigenstate is constructed .",
    "full diagonalization of the hamiltonian is not required ; however , the renormalization condition and the eigenvalue problem must be solved as a coupled system .",
    "the wave function renormalization is directly available from the bare amplitude in the fock state expansion .    to within the accuracy of the calculation ,",
    "the values for the anomalous moment become constant for an ultraviolet cutoff sufficiently large .",
    "however , most four - point graphs that arise in the bound - state problem are log divergent . to any order the divergences cancel if all graphs are included , but the tamm ",
    "dancoff truncation spoils this .",
    "the resulting logarithmic effects are not detectable in the numerical results .",
    "the calculations presented here build on the significant amount of work that has been done recently on the use of light - cone quantization@xcite in the construction of solvable bound - state problems for strongly interacting theories .",
    "the coordinates used are based on the choice of @xmath6 as the time coordinate , where @xmath7 is the ordinary time and @xmath8 any cartesian spatial coordinate .",
    "a variety of field theories have been analyzed in this way .",
    "most theories considered have been simple model theories in one space dimension ; however , there have been studies of three dimensional theories , including the wick ",
    "cutkosky model@xcite , the yukawa model@xcite , quantum electrodynamics ( qed)@xcite , and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite . there has also been some work on nonperturbative scattering calculations@xcite and on the stationary phase approximation to the soliton in @xmath9@xcite .    much of this work has involved numerical studies .",
    "brodsky , pauli , and co - workers have analyzed various one - dimensional theories ( yukawa@xcite , qed@xcite , and qcd@xcite ) and have devoted a considerable amount of effort to three - dimensional qed@xcite .",
    "some work on the three - dimensional wick ",
    "cutkosky model@xcite has been done by sawicki and co - workers , ji and furnstahl@xcite , and wivoda and hiller@xcite .",
    "one - dimensional scalar theories , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , have been studied by harindranath and vary@xcite .",
    "work on the one - dimensional yukawa model has been done by harindranath , shigemitsu and perry@xcite ; this was based on a tamm ",
    "dancoff truncation@xcite and used basis - function methods as well as a discretization technique .",
    "the basis - function methods have been extended to the three - dimensional case by gazek _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "a preliminary treatment of qcd in three dimensions has been attempted by hollenberg and co - workers@xcite .",
    "dimensional reduction of qcd to an effective theory in @xmath12 dimensions has also been considered@xcite .",
    "other nonperturbative approaches applicable to qcd include lattice gauge theory@xcite , sum rules@xcite , and schwinger ",
    ". a particularly successful form of lattice theory has been developed by lepage and collaborators@xcite who use tadpole - improved actions to reduce discretization errors .",
    "the hamiltonian form of lattice theory@xcite is actually similar to the approach usually taken in light - cone quantization , in that a hamiltonian operator is constructed and partially diagonalized@xcite .",
    "there has also been work on combinations of the lattice with light - cone methods in the transverse lattice method@xcite and in direct use of a light - cone lattice@xcite .",
    "two important aspects of qcd that all these methods address are vacuum structure and symmetry breaking . in light - cone quantization",
    ", the vacuum appears to be the trivial perturbative vacuum .",
    "this has the advantage that one can compute massive states immediately without first computing the vacuum state .",
    "however , in equal - time quantization , the nontrivial structure of the qcd vacuum is known to be important .",
    "this paradox of the trivial vacuum has received much attention .",
    "nonperturbative analyses of various light - cone models indicate that interactions induced by zero modes@xcite and other considerations@xcite play important roles in generating effects such as symmetry breaking@xcite that are usually associated with the vacuum .    the progress made recently in the application of light - cone quantization owes much to earlier work@xcite",
    "the development then was aimed at perturbation theory , and in particular its application to deep inelastic scattering , but much has been carried over to bound - state problems .",

    "given the tamm - dancoff truncation , an alternative is to view the eigenvalue problem as a few - body problem@xcite for which the correct effective hamiltonian and the generators of translations , rotations , and boosts must satisfy the usual poincar algebra@xcite .",
    "the effective operators might be constructed by adding minimal finite corrections to their field - theoretic forms .",
    "the finite corrections are determined by the requirement that the poincar algebra be satisfied .",
    "for the results presented here , no attempt has been made to include these finite corrections .",
    "an accurate dlcq calculation for a basis with at most one photon can be easily done when instantaneous interactions are neglected . the accuracy can be verified directly because the integrals that yield @xmath0 can be performed analytically@xcite . in the limit of infinite cutoff and zero photon mass",
    "this reproduces the schwinger@xcite result of @xmath213 .",
    "the only coupling renormalization is a trivial wave function renormalization .",
    "the dlcq result at various cutoff values is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] for a photon mass of @xmath214 .",
    "weighting methods@xcite are a critical part of the calculation .",
    "=    calculations with a basis that includes at most two photons have been done at five different values of the cutoff for a coupling of @xmath199 .",
    "they are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the two - photon contribution adds approximately 40% .",
    "this is much larger than the order of magnitude ( @xmath215 or 3% ) that one would expect .",
    "it is also opposite in sign to the sommerfield ",
    "petermann contribution@xcite of @xmath216 to the anomalous moment .",
    "we attribute this large difference to the absence of z graphs .",
    "the basis sizes involved are on the order of 1 to 4 million , which translates to solution of linear systems with 4000 to 10,000 variables once the two - photon states are integrated out and symmetries of the one - photon states are used .",
    "the values obtained from dlcq were extrapolated to @xmath217 and @xmath218 by fits to @xmath219 .",
    "exclusion of the last term provided an estimate of the error in the fit , which is reflected in the error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the values of @xmath55 ranged from 21 to 31 and those of @xmath58 from 7 to 9 , 10 or 11 , depending on matrix size limitations .",
    "the time required for an extrapolated value at a fixed cutoff is roughly 10 hours on a cray x - mp , using less than 32 million words of memory .",
    "this seems quite competitive with older lattice methods , where a quenched qcd calculation of heavy - light meson wave functions@xcite required 300 hours on a cm-200@xcite , but does not yet match the effort required with the latest methods@xcite , for which calculation of the b meson magnetic form factor might require 50 hours on a good pc@xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative calculation of the anomalous moment of the electron @xmath0 , besides being of intrinsic interest itself , exposes many important issues for nonperturbative calculations within gauge theories which occur in the context of a truncated fock space .",
    "these include nonperturbative mass and coupling renormalization , control of spurious infrared singularities , determination of zero - mode contributions , and the construction of finite counterterms which restore symmetries .",
    "each of these has been addressed in the preceding sections , and the first two have been incorporated into a dlcq calculation where as many as two photons are included in the basis .",
    "we have presented results for @xmath0 computed in a light - cone - gauge fock space truncated to include one bare electron and at most two photons ; _ i.e. _ , up to two photons in flight .",
    "the calculational scheme uses an invariant mass cutoff , discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) , a tamm  dancoff truncation of the fock space , and a photon mass regulator .",
    "we have utilized new weighting methods which greatly improve convergence to the continuum within dlcq .",
    "a large renormalized coupling strength @xmath1 is then used to make the nonperturbative effects in the electron anomalous moment from the one - electron , two - photon fock state sector numerically detectable .",
    "results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the disagreement between these results and what one would expect from perturbation theory at order @xmath3 indicates that the effect of z graphs needs to be included in a systematic way .",
    "this can be done as an effective interaction , to avoid expansion of the fock basis to include pair states . the corresponding piece of the instantaneous fermion interaction , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : infraredcancel](c ) , must then also be included to maintain an infrared cancellation .",
    "new counterterms : one piece of the infinite renormalization is missing in the calculation . as discussed in section  [ sec : fourptgraphs ] , it requires a new nonperturbative counterterm for the logarithmic divergences present in diagrams of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourpointgraphs](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the divergence arises because the tamm  dancoff truncation prevents certain cancellations .",
    "construction of the counterterm will likely require analysis of scattering processes .",
    "zero modes in dlcq : before full consideration of photon zero modes is undertaken , we recommend renewed study of zero modes in a scalar theory where the constraint equation can be solved exactly@xcite .",
    "this may show that , when the invariant mass cutoff ( [ eq : cutoff ] ) is used , zero modes do not make a significant numerical contribution .",
    "if instead there is an important contribution , it should be computed only to leading order in the numerical resolution , to be consistent with the level of approximation used in the basic dlcq approach .",
    "use of symmetries in dlcq renormalization : the restoration of symmetries should then complete construction of the light - cone hamiltonian",
    ". one can normalize to specific physical processes@xcite or take an abstract approach based on the algebra of the poincar generators@xcite .",
    "higher fock states : once the two - photon calculation is fully under control , the addition of @xmath220 states can be considered .",
    "this will require analysis of photon mass and wave function renormalization .",
    "many of the complications of the light - cone fock state analysis presented here can be traced to the complexity of sector - dependent renormalization . given such complications the newly developed alternative of pauli ",
    "villars regularization@xcite may be the preferred approach .",
    "within such a scheme , it is also likely that the limitation to a small number of photons can be relaxed .",
    "the analysis presented here is the first step in a systematic program to compute physical quantities in gauge theory systematically utilizing a light - cone fock expansion .",
    "it will also be interesting to use these methods and the present knowledge of the dressed - electron state in qed in order to systematically construct the neutral positronium state as a composite of a dressed electron and positron .",
    "such an analysis can serve as the prototype for systemic nonperturbative construction of colorless bound state hadrons in qcd .",
