    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have been intensively studied over past decades , and recently attracted tremendous attention for a number of applications@xcite , since tmds have a finite energy band gap , which is more advantageous than graphene . among the tmds",
    ", mote@xmath0 has a stronger spin - orbit coupling than other mo related tmd materials ( mox@xmath0 , x = s , se ) , which leads to a longer decoherence time both for valley and spin freedom @xcite and thus mote@xmath0 is considered to be used for ideal valleytronic devices@xcite . unlike other tmds , mote@xmath0 has unique structural properties , such as a thermally - induced structural phase transition at around 900@xmath1c from the @xmath2-phase diamagnetic semiconductor to the @xmath3-phase paramagnetic metal@xcite .",
    "mote@xmath0 has the smallest direct energy band gap ( @xmath4 1.1 ev ) at the k point ( hexagonal corner ) in the brillouin zone ( bz ) among all semiconducting tmds , the band gap is similar to the indirect gap ( @xmath4 1.1 ev ) of silicon@xcite .",
    "mote@xmath0 is thus suitable for nanoelectronics devices@xcite and for studying exciton effects at the k points@xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy is a useful tool for characterizing tmds since we get many information @xcite such as number of layers , electronic and phonon properties of tmds .",
    "recent raman spectroscopy studies of monolayer and few - layer mote@xmath0 using visible light ( 1.9 @xmath4 2.5 ev ) show that there exists some unassigned raman spectra which can not be assigned to a first - order raman process@xcite , and the assignment of these raman spectra is the subject of the present paper .",
    "raman spectra of tmds have been reported for several decades@xcite .",
    "the first - order raman process in tmds has been widely investigated and is now well understood @xcite .",
    "however , the study of second - order raman spectra did not give consistent assignments for different tmds@xcite .",
    "for example , stacy _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and many other groups@xcite assigned some of the raman peaks of 2h - mos@xmath0 to either combination or overtone second - order phonon modes occurring at the m point ( center of hexagonal edge ) in the brillouin zone .",
    "_ @xcite also assigned phonon modes in few - layer wse@xmath0 according to the m point phonon . on the other hand , sourisseau _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ascribed the second - order raman process of 2h - ws@xmath0 to the k point phonons .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite considered that electrons are scattered by the m point phonons between the k point and i point ( one point along @xmath5k direction ) , and that this process is responsible for the double resonant raman process in few - layer ws@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , sekine _ _ et al.__@xcite found a dispersive raman peak in 2h - mos@xmath0 and interpreted this peak in terms of a two - phonon raman process at the k point .",
    "the different assignments for both few - layer or bulk mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , either at the m or k points , have not been well investigated , since most of these assignments to second - order raman peaks have been made merely by comparing phonon frequencies with reference to some inelastic neutron scattering results@xcite .",
    "thus a detailed analysis with use of double resonance raman theory is needed , especially for understanding both mono- and few - layer mote@xmath0 that are discussed in this paper .    in the present paper",
    ", we mainly study the second - order raman spectra of monolayer mote@xmath0 , based on _ ab initio _ electronic band calculations , density functional perturbation theory and associated experimental raman spectroscopy . from our electronic band structure calculation , we have found a saddle point of the energy dispersion at the m points in the bz , which gives rise to two - dimensional van hove singularity ( vhs ) in the electronic density of states .",
    "the energy separation between two vhss ( 2.30 and 2.07 ev ) are matched to the 2.33 ev ( 532 nm ) and 1.96 ev ( 633 nm ) laser excitations in our experiment in which resonant optical absorption occurs at the m points .",
    "consequently , inter - valley electron - phonon scattering process occurs between two of the three inequivalent m ( m , m@xmath6 , m@xmath7 ) points , giving rise to a double resonance raman process .",
    "we propose that this double resonance process occurring at the m points is essential for the interpretation of the observed second - order raman peaks of mote@xmath0 .",
    "the experimental second - order raman frequencies as a function of laser excitation energy confirm our interpretation of the double resonance raman spectra .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in ii and iii ,",
    "we briefly show computational details and experimental methods , respectively . in iv , both experimental and theoretical results for mono- and few - layer mote@xmath0 raman spectra are given .",
    "we assign second - order raman peaks by comparing the calculated results with the observed raman spectra . in v summary of the paper",
    "further information such as layer - number dependence is discussed in supplemental material .",
    "we performed the electronic and phonon energy dispersion calculations on monolayer and few - layer mote@xmath0 by using first - principles density functional theory within the local density approximation ( lda ) as implemented in the quantum - espresso code @xcite .",
    "the structures of monolayer and few - layer mote@xmath0 that are used in the present experiment are @xmath2-mote@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the aa@xmath6 and aa@xmath6a stacking geometries are used in the computational study for bi - layer and tri - layer mote@xmath0 , respectively , since these stacking geometries are more stable than the other possibilities@xcite .",
    "aa@xmath6 stacking refers to the geometry which has a mo ( te ) atom of one layer on top of a te ( mo ) atom of the other layer .",
    "the few - layer mote@xmath0 are separated by 25   from one another in a unit cell of the calculation to eliminate the inter - few - layer interaction .",
    "we used projector augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials@xcite with a plane - wave cutoff energy of 65 ry to describe the interaction between electrons and ions .",
    "the spin - orbit split electronic band structures were calculated by relativistic pseudopotentials derived from an atomic dirac - like equation .",

    "the phonon energy dispersion relations of mote@xmath0 are calculated based on density functional perturbation theory @xcite . in order to visualize the vibrational modes at the m point ,",

    "the optical absorption spectrum is calculated by the real ( @xmath11@xmath6 ) and imaginary ( @xmath11@xmath7 ) parts of the dielectric function as a function of photon energy , respectively , based on the paw methodology@xcite and the conventional kramers - kronig transformation .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath2 is described by @xmath2 = 4@xmath12e@xmath13/(@xmath14 ) , where e@xmath13 is the incident laser excitation energy , @xmath15 the planck constant , @xmath16 the speed of light , and @xmath17 is the extinction coefficient@xcite , that is , @xmath17",
    "= @xmath18 .",
    "bulk crystals of @xmath2-mote@xmath0 were prepared through a chemical vapor transport method@xcite .",
    "atomically thin crystals of mote@xmath0 were mechanically exfoliated from the bulk crystals onto silicon substrates with a 90 nm - thick oxide layer on top .",
    "the thicknesses of the atomic crystals were identified using optical microscopy and first - order raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy measurements for monolayer mote@xmath0 were performed using 532 , 633 and 785 nm excitation lasers for discussing the observed phonon dispersion due to double resonance raman theory@xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy studies of few - layer mote@xmath0 under 532 nm laser excitation were also performed and the results are discussed in the supporting materials .",
    "the grating sizes were 1200 , 1800 and 2400 lines / mm for the 785 , 633 and 532 nm laser excitation measurements , respectively .",
    "the magnification of the objective lens was 100x .",
    "the accumulation times were 150 - 200 seconds .",
    "the laser power was kept below 0.1 mw , 0.2 mw and 3.0 mw for the 532 , 633 and 785 nm excitation lasers , respectively , in order to avoid damage to the samples .",
    "all measurements were performed at room temperature in the backscattering configuration .",
    "since this paper gives greater emphasis to a theoretical understanding of the 2nd - order raman scattering processes , we do not present many experimental details .",
    "however , more details about the characterization of the number of layers in our mote@xmath0 samples can be obtained in one of the previous works on mote@xmath0 synthesis and characterization , based on the first - order raman spectra@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows raman spectra of mono- to tri - layer mote@xmath0 under the 532 nm ( 2.33 ev ) laser excitation .",
    "the raman spectra show three strong peaks , including the in - plane e@xmath19 mode and the out - of - plane a@xmath20 mode for monolayer and few - layer mote@xmath0 , as well as the e@xmath20 mode and the b@xmath19 mode for bi- and tri - layer mote@xmath0 , that were observed previously@xcite .",
    "these spectra are assigned to the first - order raman spectra of the @xmath5 point phonons@xcite . however , we observe additional peaks with relatively small intensities , which can not be assigned as first - order raman spectra@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , we denote the weak raman spectra as @xmath21 ( i = 1 , 2 , ... , 6 ) .    since the second - order raman spectra are dispersive as a function of excitation energy@xcite , we performed raman spectroscopy measurements using different excitation laser energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) we show raman spectra of monolayer mote@xmath0 under 2.33 ev ( 532 nm ) , 1.96 ev ( 633 nm ) and 1.58 ev ( 785 nm ) laser excitation energies . here",
    "the raman intensities are normalized using the non - resonant si peak intensity at 520 @xmath22 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "we find that the peak positions of each @xmath21 either upshift or downshift by up to several @xmath22 for different laser excitation energies , suggesting that these peaks are associated with a second - order raman process@xcite .",
    "considering that the second - order process is usually connected to the electronic properties by double resonance raman theory@xcite , we calculate the electronic band structure , the density of states ( dos ) and the optical absorption spectra of monolayer mote@xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "our calculated energy dispersion reproduces the main observed features@xcite such as the direct electronic band gap ( 1.00 ev ) and the spin - orbit splitting of the valence band ( @xmath4230 mev ) at the k point which are close to 1.10 ev and 250 mev , respectively , obtained from the optical absorption measurements@xcite .",
    "it is noted that the energy band gap is underestimated by the local density functional method . in order to fit the experimental data ,",
    "the conduction bands are upshifted by 0.10 ev , so are the dos and optical absorption spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we show the calculated electronic energy band and dos . from the parabolic bands around the k point , two - dimensional ( 2d )",
    "dos gives constant values , while at the m point we have found saddle points of the energy dispersion in the electronic band , the corresponding dos gives logarithmic @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 - @xmath26@xmath24 divergence as is known as van hove singularity ( vhs ) in 2d systems .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , we show the calculated real ( @xmath27 ) and imaginary ( @xmath28 ) parts of the dielectric constant and the optical absorption coefficient @xmath2 as a function of photon energy .",
    "@xmath28 has a nonzero value from the photon energy e@xmath13 = 1.10 ev which corresponds to the energy gap , and a peak at e@xmath13 @xmath4 1.80 ev .",
    "a strong optical absorption at 1.80 ev from our calculation agrees well with the large peak at around 1.83 ev from the optical absorption measurement by ruppert et al.@xcite on monolayer mote@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the electronic excitation energy of 2.30 ev ( 2.07 ev ) from the third ( top ) valence band to the lowest ( third lowest ) conduction band at the m point matches very well with the laser energy 2.33 ev ( 1.96 ev ) used in our experiment , as indicated by pink ( orange ) arrows in the band structure of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "thus resonant optical absorption at these laser lines is expected .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , we plot equi - energy contour for the conduction band energies e@xmath29 which correspond to the laser excitation energies e@xmath30 .",
    "e@xmath29 = 1.52 and 1.57 ev for c1 and 1.72 ev for c2 correspond to the e@xmath30 = 1.58 , 2.33 and 1.96 ev , respectively , as indicated by blue , pink , and orange arrows in fig .",

    "c1 , c2 and the valence bands which have the same spin@xcite are highlighted in red solid lines in the band structure .",
    "the equi - energy contour lines e@xmath31 and e@xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) both show the saddle point shape of the energy dispersion in the vicinity of the m point .",
    "that is , the energy band e@xmath31 ( e@xmath32 ) starting from the m point monotonically decreases ( increases ) along the m - k direction , whereas this band energy increases ( decreases ) along the m-@xmath5 direction .",
    "when we decrease laser excitation energies from 2.33 to 1.58 ev , the contour lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) left change the shapes around the m point , suggesting that the area inside of the contour line for each m point decreases with increasing laser excitation energy .",
    "this situation is opposite to the case of graphene in which the equi - energy contour is almost circular and the area increases with increasing energy .",

    "this process generates two phonons ( @xmath35 , -@xmath34 ) and ( @xmath36 , @xmath34 ) . ]",
    "if the laser excitation energy matches the optical transition energy at the m point , we expect that many photo - excited electrons at the m point are scattered to the inequivalent m@xmath6 or m@xmath7 points by an inter - valley resonant electron - phonon interaction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the inter - valley electron - phonon process , together with the electron - photon process , gives rise to a double resonance raman process .",

    "[ fig3](b ) , a photo - excited electron will be scattered from m to m@xmath6 by emitting a phonon with energy @xmath35 and momentum @xmath37 , which conserves the energy and momentum of both the electron and the phonon",

    "[ fig3](a ) , the momentum @xmath34 of the phonon can only have a magnitude of @xmath39 or @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "when we measure the value of @xmath24q@xmath24 from the @xmath5 point , the @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath42 or @xmath43 or @xmath44 , respectively . since @xmath43 = @xmath45 + @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath45 , all phonon modes related to double resonance process correspond to phonon modes at the m point .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table2 ]    finally , we briefly comment on the exciton effect on the double resonance raman spectra of mote@xmath0 . since the excitonic states appear at the direct energy gap at the k point of the bz@xcite , we expect that the excitonic energy is around 1.1 ev for mote@xmath0 , which is much smaller than the three laser energies we used ( 1.58 - 2.33 ev ) .",
    "as far as we consider only mote@xmath0 , we can safely neglect the exciton effect at the k point .",
    "however , in the case of other tmds ( mos@xmath0@xcite , ws@xmath0@xcite , wse@xmath0@xcite ) energy gaps at the k point ( e@xmath48(k ) ) lie in the range of 1.7 - 1.9 ev as shown in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the laser energies used in the experiments lie in a range from 1.83 to 2.41 ev .",
    "thus the exciton effect needs to be considered for some laser energies .",
    "nevertheless , when we discuss the m - point phonon of the other tmds , we expect that the second - order raman spectra do not appear , since the optical transition energies at the m point is larger than 3.0 ev",

    "in summary , we have investigated the second - order raman spectra of mote@xmath0 systems , based on an _ ab initio _ density functional calculation , and compared with the experimental raman spectroscopy .",
