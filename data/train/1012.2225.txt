    "the experimental discovery of superfluidity in helium ii by kapitsa @xcite and allen and misener @xcite in 1938 has triggered a great theoretical interest in this phenomenon .",
    "one of the most spectacular effects related to superfluidity of helium ii is its ability to flow through narrow channels with apparently zero viscosity .",
    "extensive studies of this system were very important for the foundation of the theory of bose and fermi quantum liquids . in this system however , even at the lowest temperatures , the strong interactions between the helium atoms deplete the population of the bose - einstein condensate to about 10% of the total mass whereas the superfluid fraction is almost 100% .",
    "the situation is substantially different with dilute ultracold atomic gases .",
    "the first implementation of a bose - einstein condensation @xcite in alkali atoms has opened new possibilities to explore bose quantum liquids at much higher level of control . indeed , contrary to liquid helium , large condensate fractions",
    "are routinely obtained with dilute atomic gases as the atoms are very weakly interacting . to date , many phenomena previously observed in liquid helium below the lambda point have found their experimental counterpart with ultracold alkali gases even if the experimental evidence of superfluidity in atomic condensates has been a very challenging task .",
    "one of the main signatures of superfluid flow is the generation of quantized vortices when the system is set into rotation .",
    "after many efforts such quantized vortices , and also arrays of vortices , were observed in atomic condensates @xcite .",
    "observation of the first sound @xcite , of scissor modes @xcite or of the critical velocity @xcite beyond which the superfluid flow breaks down , are other examples of the manifestation of this spectacular macroscopic quantum phenomenon in trapped ultracold atomic systems .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned properties , helium ii exhibits also a very unusual feature related to the flow of heat .",
    "variations of temperature propagate in this system in a form of waves known as the second sound .",
    "both these extraordinary features , i.e. non viscous flow and unusual heat transport , manifest themselves in full glory in the helium fountain effect , called also the thermo - mechanical effect .",
    "its first observation was reported by allen and jones @xcite . in their original setup ,",
    "the lower part of a u - tube packed with fine emery powder was immersed into a vessel containing liquid helium ii .",
    "a temperature gradient was created by shining a light beam on the powder which got heated due to light absorption . as a result of the temperature gradient ,",
    "a superfluid flow is generated from the cold liquid helium reservoir to the hotter region .",
    "this flow can be so strong that a jet of helium is forced up through the vertical part of the u - tube to a height of several centimeters , hence the fountain effect name .",
    "up to now , there exists many different experimental implementations of this spectacular effect and one of them is shown in fig.[fount ] .",
    "a small vessel , connected to a bulb filled with emery powder forming a very fine capillary net , is immersed in the container of liquid helium ii . when the electric heater is off the superfluid liquid flows freely through the capillary net in the bulb and fills in the small vessel as shown in panel ( a ) of fig.[fount ] .",
    "if now the superfluid helium inside the small vessel is heated then the level of the liquid in the vessel increases above the level of the liquid in the big container , see panel ( b ) .",
    "a continuous heating sustains the flow from the colder part of the system to the hotter one , an observation at variance with our ordinary everyday life experience .",
    "eventually liquid helium reaches the top of the small vessel where it forms the helium fountain , see panel ( c ) .    the explanation for this counter - intuitive thermo - mechanical effect is closely related to the notion of the second sound and to the two - fluid model developed by tisza and landau @xcite .",
    "this approach assumes the existence of two co - existing components of the liquid helium : the superfluid and the normal one .",
    "the normal component is viscous and can transport heat . on contrary",
    ", the superfluid component has no viscosity and can not transport heat .",
    "because it is viscous , the normal component can not flow through the capillary net but the superfluid can .",
    "heat transport is thus forbidden because it can only be carried by the normal component . as a consequence ,",
    "the system can not reach thermal equilibrium and the temperature in the reservoir keeps smaller than the temperature in the small vessel .",
    "only mechanical equilibrium is allowed , i.e. the chemical potentials in both vessels have to equilibrate .",
    "heating of the superfluid component inside the small vessel leads to a reduction of the chemical potential per unit mass in this vessel and this reduction is compensated by the flow of the superfluid component from the reservoir .",
    "the two - fluid model for helium ii assumes a local thermal equilibrium which signifies a hydrodynamic regime where the collision time is the shortest time scale . if this is indeed the case for superfluid helium ii , which is a strongly interacting system , it is generally not for trapped ultracold dilute atomic gases where reaching this regime proves extremely difficult .",
    "for example , second sound has only been observed recently @xcite . as a consequence , the usual two - fluid model fails to apply and , up to our knowledge , there are no theoretical predictions about heat transport in weakly - interacting atomic condensates .",
    "it is not even obvious if an effect similar to the helium fountain can be observed in these dilute atomic systems .",
    "this is probably why the analog of this classic textbook phenomenon has not yet been studied in the context of ultracold trapped atomic gases .",
    "nevertheless the question of the nature of heat transport in these weakly - interacting atomic condensates seems to be well posed .",
    "there are not many experiments where a non - equilibrium transfer of atoms related to temperature differences have been studied .",
    "we should recall here the experiment of the mit group , where distillation of a condensate was observed @xcite .",
    "the authors studied how the superfluid system ` discovers ' the existence of a dynamically - created global minimum of the trapping potential and how the system gets to this minimum .",
    "theoretical studies of the corresponding 1d situation suggested different dynamical behaviors of the thermal fraction and of the superfluid component which , in some sense , resemble the fountain effect @xcite .    in the present work we theoretically study the non - equilibrium dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate which is driven by a temperature gradient . we will show that an effect qualitatively very similar to the helium fountain may be observed in experiments with trapped ultracold dilute atomic gases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we briefly introduce the classical field approximation . sec .",
    "[ system ] describes the system under consideration and our numerical procedure . then in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present and analyze our numerical data .",
    "we show that the thermo - mechanical effect is indeed present in our system and we highlight the importance of distinguishing between the superfluid , normal , condensate and thermal components of the system .",
    "finally , we give in sec .",
    "[ concl ] some concluding remarks .",
    "there exist different effective methods to describe and study dynamical effects in condensates at nonzero temperature .",
    "for example , the zaremba - nikuni - griffin formalism assumes a splitting of the system into a condensate and a thermal cloud @xcite whereas different versions of the classical fields method describe both the condensate and the thermal cloud by a single gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite . here , we will use the classical fields method as described in @xcite and optimized in @xcite for arbitrary trapping potentials .",
    "since this latter paper describes quite extensively how to prepare the classical fields in a thermodynamic equilibrium state characterized by temperature @xmath0 , total number of atoms @xmath1 , condensate fraction @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the number of condensed atoms ) , and scattering length @xmath4 , we will just briefly describe here the main ingredients of this approach .",
    "we start with the usual bosonic field operator @xmath5 which annihilates an atom at point @xmath6 and time @xmath7 .",
    "it obeys the standard bosonic commutation relations : @xmath8 & =   \\delta ( { \\rm { \\bf r}}-{\\rm { \\bf r } ' } ) \\nonumber \\\\   [ \\hat { \\psi}^+({\\rm { \\bf r}},t),\\hat { \\psi}^+({\\rm { \\bf r}'},t ) ] & =   0 \\nonumber \\\\   [ \\hat { \\psi}({\\rm { \\bf r}},t),\\hat { \\psi}({\\rm { \\bf r}'},t ) ] & =   0 , \\label{comrel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and evolves according to the heisenberg equation of motion : @xmath9 \\hat { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + g\\ , \\hat{\\psi } ^+({\\rm { \\bf r}},t ) \\hat { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t ) \\hat { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\ , , \\label{heisenberg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the ( possibly ) time - dependent trapping potential and @xmath11 is the coupling constant expressed in terms of the s - wave scattering length @xmath4 .",
    "the field operator itself can be expanded in a basis of one - particle wave functions @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the set of all necessary one - particle quantum numbers : @xmath14 in the presence of a trap , a natural choice for the one - particle modes @xmath15 would be the harmonic oscillator modes , otherwise one generally uses plane wave states .",
    "the classical fields method is an extension of the bogoliubov idea to finite temperatures and gives some microscopic basis to the two - fluid model .",
    "the main idea is to assume that modes @xmath15 in expansion ( [ expansion ] ) having an energy @xmath16 less than a certain cut - off energy @xmath17 are macroscopically occupied and , consequently , to replace all corresponding annihilation operators by @xmath18-number amplitudes : @xmath19 assuming further that the second sum in ( [ expansion2 ] ) is small and can be neglected , the field operator @xmath5 is turned into a classical complex wave function : @xmath20 in this way , both the condensate and a thermal cloud of atoms , interacting with each other , will be described by a single classical field @xmath21 . injecting ( [ expansion1 ] ) into ( [ heisenberg ] )",
    ", we obtain the equation of motion for the classical field : @xmath22 { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + g\\ , { \\psi } ^*({\\rm { \\bf r}},t ) { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t ) { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\ , . \\label{cfequation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in numerical implementations , one controls a total energy , a number of macroscopically occupied modes @xmath15 and a value of @xmath23 . the energy - truncation constraint @xmath24 is usually implemented by solving eq .",
    "( [ cfequation ] ) on a rectangular grid using the fast fourier transform technique .",
    "the spatial grid step determines the maximal momentum per particle , and hence the energy , in the system whereas the use of the fourier transform implies projection in momentum space .",
    "equation ( [ cfequation ] ) looks identical to the usual gross - pitaevskii equation describing a bose - einstein condensate at zero temperature .",
    "however , the interpretation of the complex wave function @xmath25 is here different .",
    "it describes _ all _ the atoms in the system .",
    "therefore , the question arises on how to extract all these modes out of the time - evolving classical field @xmath25 . for this purpose ,",
    "we follow the definition of bose - einstein condensation originally proposed by penrose and onsager @xcite where the condensate is assigned to be described by the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of the one - particle density matrix .",
    "this one - particle density matrix reads : @xmath26 and obviously corresponds to a pure state with all atoms in the condensate mode .",
    "this is because eq .",
    "( [ denmat ] ) is the spectral decomposition of the one - particle density matrix . to extract the modes out of the classical field some kind of averaging is needed . in a typical experiment , one generally measures the column density integrated along some direction .",
    "we implement here the same type of procedure and define the coarse - grained density matrix : @xmath27 from which we extract the corresponding eigenvalues in order to apply the penrose - onsager criterion .",
    "we have tested the ability of this averaging procedure for a classical field at thermal equilibrium in a harmonic trap by comparing it to the results obtained when the original density matrix is averaged long enough over time . with a @xmath28% accuracy ,",
    "both methods give the same results . solving the eigenvalue problem for the coarse - grained density matrix ( [ rhoave ] ) leads to the decomposition : @xmath29 where the relative occupation numbers @xmath30 of the orthonormal macroscopically occupied modes @xmath31 are ordered according to @xmath32 . for future convenience , we define the eigenmodes of the coarse - grained one - particle density matrix which are normalized to the relative occupation numbers of these modes and the corresponding one - particle density matrix @xmath33 : @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the condensate being described by @xmath37 .    according to the standard definition , the condensate wave function corresponds to @xmath38 and the thermal density is simply : @xmath39 in an equilibrium situation , the relative occupation numbers @xmath40 do not depend on time . in this case , the total number of atoms is determined from the smallest eigenvalue of the one - particle density matrix through @xmath41 , where @xmath42 for the 3d harmonic oscillator @xcite , from which one can infer the value of the interaction strength @xmath43 .",
    "the temperature @xmath0 of the system is then given by the energy of this highest occupied mode .",
    "let us note that any initial state evolving with the gross - pitaevskii equation reaches a state of thermal equilibrium characterized by a temperature , a total number of particles and an interaction strength @xmath43 .",
    "however to obtain an equilibrium classical field for a given set of parameters , one has to properly choose the energy of the initial state and the cut - off parameter @xmath17 . this task is time consuming because the temperature and the number of particles can only be assigned to the field _",
    "after _ the equilibrium is reached . to speed up the preparation of the initial equilibrium state , we first solve the self - consistent hartree - fock model ( schfm ) @xcite .",
    "this allows us to estimate quite accurately the energy of the state for a given temperature and particle number .",
    "the detailed description of this procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we only recall the schfm equations : @xmath44 \\label{schf1 }   \\\\ & & f({\\bf r},{\\bf p } ) = \\left ( e^ { [ { \\bf p}^2/2 m + v_{e}({\\bf r } ) - \\mu ] / k_b t } -1 \\right)^{-1 } \\label{schf2 }   \\\\ & & \\rho_{t}({\\bf r } ) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_t^3 } \\;\\ ;   g_{3/2}\\left ( e^{\\left[\\mu - v_{e}({\\bf r } ) \\right ] /k_b t } \\right ) \\label{schf3 }   \\\\ & & v_{e}({\\bf r } ) = v_{tr}({\\bf r } ) + 2\\ ,   g\\ ,   \\rho_0({\\bf r } ) + 2\\ ,   g\\ ,   \\rho_{t}({\\bf r } ) \\label{schf4 } \\\\ & & \\mu = g\\ , \\rho_0(0 ) + 2\\ , g\\ , \\rho_{t}(0 ) + v_{tr}(0 ) \\",
    ", , \\label{schf5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "the @xmath46 function is given by the expansion : @xmath47 the main variables in this approach are the condensate density @xmath48 and the phase space distribution function @xmath49 of thermal component .",
    "the thermal density @xmath50 can be obtained from @xmath49 by integrating over momenta .",
    "the effective potential @xmath51 and the chemical potential @xmath52 are functions of the condensate density and of the thermal density .",
    "the condensate and thermal densities can be found iteratively for a given number of atoms and condensate fraction by taking into account that the total number of atoms is @xmath53 .",
    "the schfm is known to work well for the homogeneous harmonic trap @xcite and for inhomogeneous traps with small aspect ratio @xcite . in the present work",
    "we need the schfm not only to speed up the preparation of an initial state but also because we will use the chemical potential and the thermal atoms distribution function in the section [ results ] to explain some aspects of the studied phenomena .",
    "following @xcite , we consider here a cloud of na atoms prepared in the @xmath54 state and confined in a harmonic trap with trapping frequencies @xmath55hz and @xmath56hz . the scattering length for this system is @xmath57 nm . in subsequent calculations",
    ", we use the harmonic oscillator length @xmath58 m , time @xmath59ms and energy @xmath60 as space , time and energy units ( oscillatory units ) .",
    "the preparation of an initial state in the harmonic trap @xmath61 follows the steps described in the previous section .",
    "an example of such state is shown in the first row of fig.[traps ] . in this particular case",
    "the temperature of the system is @xmath62nk and the condensate fraction is about @xmath63% .",
    "we also prepared two more initial states corresponding to different condensate fractions , temperatures and numbers of atoms , see table [ table1 ] .    .",
    "numerical values of the condensate fraction @xmath2 , temperature @xmath0 , thermal energy @xmath64 , and chemical potential @xmath52 used in our simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note , that the last row of table [ fity50 ] does not contain any value for the @xmath13 coefficient nor for the corresponding normal flux @xmath65 .",
    "this is because , for wider channels , the rate of flow of the normal component is changing significantly in time and fitting the decrease by a linear function is no longer reasonable . in this case",
    ", the flow is fastest at the beginning as it is visible in fig.[relocpsp2 ] .",
    "we did not include the value of the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 in the tables , even if they increase the precision of our fitting procedure , as they are essentially irrelevant four our considerations . for channel widths @xmath69 , the coefficients @xmath70 turns out to be smaller than the statistical error ( @xmath71 ) and",
    "are also not included in tables [ fity20 ] and [ fity50 ] .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the fact that the dynamics takes place in the collisionless regime as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we see that both superfluid and normal flow rates increase with the channel width . moreover , the superfluid flow rate is in all cases larger by two or three orders of magnitude then the normal one .",
    "we expect that the normal component behaves like a classical fluid .",
    "therefore , its flow rate should correspond to the flux of atoms distributed initially according to the classical phase space distribution as obtained from the schfm equations described in the second section .",
    "our schfm calculations indeed give a value very close to the one obtained from the classical fields dynamics .",
    "for example the flux of thermal atoms for a system initially prepared with @xmath72% of condensed atoms in the hotter vessel and for a final channel width @xmath73 ( @xmath74 m ) is found to be @xmath75 atoms / ms .",
    "the classical field approximation gives a similar result @xmath76 atoms / ms .",
    "indeed , the very slow transfer of the normal component is a phase space distribution effect  a very small fraction of thermal atoms have velocities aligned along the channel . on the contrary , the superfluid component is built from coherent modes .",
    "the coherence of these modes extends over the entire two vessels and is established on a short time scale of about @xmath77 ( @xmath62ms ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the analog of the thermo - mechanical effect , observed in the celebrated superfluid helium ii fountain , could be also observed with present - day experiments using weakly - interacting degenerate trapped alkali gases .",
    "we have proposed a realistic experimental setup based on a standard harmonic confinement potential and analyzed it with the help of the classical fields aproximation method .",
    "the trapped ultracold gas is first split in two subsytems thanks to a potential barrier .",
    "each of the two independent subsystems achieve their own thermal equilibrium , the final temperature in the two vessels being different . at a later time",
    ", a communication channel is opened between the two vessels , and the atoms are allowed to flow from one vessel to the other .",
    "we have shown that the transport of atoms between the two subsystems prepared at two different temperatures exhibits the two main features of the superfluid fountain effect : the mechanical equilibrium is obtained almost instantly while the thermal equilibrium is never reached .",
    "we have further shown that the superfluid component of this system is composed of all eigenmodes of the one - particle density matrix having a sufficiently small healing length that can fit into the communication channel .",
    "the superfluid flow is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the flow of the normal component .",
    "the slow flow of the normal component can be understood as a phase space effect .",
