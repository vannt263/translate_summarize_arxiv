    "in this paper , we always assume that the underlying field is @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the generator matrix and the parity - check matrix of an @xmath3 convolutional code @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "ariel and snyders [ 1 ] presented a construction of error - trellises based on the scalar check matrix derived from @xmath2 .",
    "they showed that when some ( @xmath5th ) `` column '' of @xmath2 has a factor @xmath6 , there is a possibility that state - space reduction can be realized .",
    "being motivated by their work , we also examined the same case .",
    "the time-@xmath7 error @xmath8 and syndrome @xmath9 are connected with the relation @xmath10 ( @xmath11 means transpose ) . from this relation ,",
    "we noticed [ 9 ] that the transformation @xmath12 is equivalent to dividing the @xmath5th column of @xmath2 by @xmath6 .",
    "that is , reduction can be realized by shifting the `` subsequence '' @xmath13 of the original error - path @xmath14 .",
    "it is stated [ 1 ] that their construction can be used also to obtain code - trellises .",
    "however , it is not described in the paper .",
    "on the other hand , our construction is based on an equivalent modification of the relation @xmath10 .",
    "hence , our method can be directly extended to code - trellises .",
    "that is , in the case of code - trellises , the construction is based on the relation @xmath15 and its equivalent modifications , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the time-@xmath7 information and code symbols , respectively .",
    "note that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the code - paths in a code - trellis and the error - paths in the corresponding error - trellis .",
    "accordingly , it is reasonable to think that the two trellises can be reduced simultaneously , if reduction is possible . here , consider the situation that the identical shifts occur both in the components of @xmath17 and in those of @xmath18 . in this case , if one trellis is reduced , then the other trellis should be equally reduced . in this paper ,",
    "based on this idea , we discuss the simultaneous reduction of a code - trellis and the corresponding error - trellis .",
    "first , we obtain the general transformations which generate the identical shifts both in the subsequences of @xmath19 and in those of @xmath14 .",
    "next , we show that these transformations preserve the relation that _ one is a generator matrix and the other is the corresponding parity - check matrix_. ( in this paper , we call this relation the `` _ gh relation _ '' and if @xmath1 and @xmath2 have this relation , then it is denoted as @xmath20 ) . using this property",
    ", it is shown that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are reduced simultaneously , if reduction is possible .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the corresponding two trellises are also reduced simultaneously .",
    "these results again imply that a code / error - trellis construction using shifted code / error - subsequences is very effective .",
    "let @xmath2 be the parity - check matrix for an @xmath3 convolutional code @xmath4 . consider the error - trellis based on the syndrome former @xmath21 . in this case",
    ", the adjoint - obvious realization of @xmath21 is assumed unless otherwise specified .",
    "assume that the @xmath5th column of @xmath2 has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the modified version of @xmath2 with the @xmath5th column being replaced by @xmath25 also , let @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "then we have @xmath28 hence , in the case where the @xmath5th column of @xmath2 has a factor @xmath29 , there is a possibility that an error - trellis with reduced number of states can be constructed by shifting the @xmath5th error - subsequence by @xmath30 time units [ 9 ] .",
    "assume that the corresponding code - trellis is terminated in the all - zero state at @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath32 is modified as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes @xmath35 ( i.e. , `` cyclic shift '' ) .",
    "the construction using shifted error - subsequences is further extended [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .",
    "that is , a reduced error - trellis can be equally constructed using `` backward - shifted '' error - subsequences .",
    "consider the transformation @xmath36 .",
    "we see that this is equivalent to `` multiplying '' the @xmath5th column of @xmath2 by @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the parity - check matrix after modification .",
    "if @xmath24 is reduced to an equivalent @xmath37 with overall constraint length less than that of @xmath2 , then reduction can be realized .",
    "we remark that the power @xmath30 of @xmath38 has to be determined properly for each @xmath5 . for the purpose",
    ", we can use the _ reciprocal dual encoder _ [ 6 ] @xmath39 associated with @xmath2 .",
    "_ example 1 ( [ 9 ] ) : _ consider the canonical parity - check matrix @xmath40 since all the columns of @xmath41 are delay free , any further reduction seems to be impossible .",
    "in fact , it follows from theorem 1 of [ 1 ] that the dimension @xmath42 of the state space of the error - trellis based on @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "however , a corresponding generator matrix is given by @xmath45 .",
    "observe that the third `` column '' of @xmath46 has a factor @xmath47 .",
    "( _ remark : _ it suffices to divide the third column by @xmath47 in order to obtain a reduced code - trellis . )",
    "this fact implies that a reduced error - trellis can be constructed [ 1 ] , [ 9 ] .",
    "then consider the reciprocal dual encoder @xmath48 note that the third column of @xmath49 has a factor @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly , dividing the third column of @xmath49 by @xmath47 , we can construct an error - trellis with @xmath44 states ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) [ 1 ] , [ 9 ] . here , notice that each error - path in the error - trellis based on @xmath43 can be represented in time - reversed order using the error - trellis based on @xmath51 .",
    "hence , a factor @xmath47 in the column of @xmath49 corresponds to backward - shifting by two time units ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) in terms of the original @xmath41 . hence , multiply the third column @xmath41 by @xmath47 .",
    "then we have @xmath53 we see that this matrix can be reduced to an equivalent canonical parity - check matrix @xmath54 by dividing the first `` row '' by @xmath47 . hence",
    ", the dimension @xmath42 can be reduced to @xmath55 .      note that the relation @xmath15 holds with respect to a generator matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the time-@xmath7 information and code symbols , respectively . in the same way as for @xmath2 , by dividing the @xmath5th column of @xmath1 by @xmath29 or by multiplying the @xmath5th column of @xmath1 by @xmath29 , reduction of @xmath1 can be realized .",
    "we see that the former corresponds to the backward - shift @xmath58 , whereas the latter corresponds to the forward - shift @xmath59 .",
    "note that the shift directions are reversed compared to @xmath2 .",
    "consider the transformations which generate the identical shifts both in the components of @xmath17 and in those of @xmath18 . now , assume that the relation @xmath20 holds .",
    "consider a pair of transformations :    1 .",

    "divide the @xmath5th column of @xmath2 by @xmath62 and multiply the same column by @xmath63 .    then    1",

    "the @xmath5th component of @xmath18 becomes @xmath65    after shifting @xmath66 by @xmath67 time units ( @xmath67 is independent of @xmath5 ) , compare the time - index of @xmath68 and that of @xmath69 .",
    "if the two time - indices coincide , then @xmath70 and @xmath71 have `` relatively '' the identical shift .",
    "this condition is written as @xmath72 where @xmath67 is a constant independent of @xmath73 .",
