    "this was illustrated by baldwin - etnyre @xcite who constructed a sequence of open books with arbitrarily large fractional dehn twist coefficients and disconnected binding that support contact structures which are not deformations of a taut foliation .",
    "this shows , in particular , that there is no global neighborhood about the multislope of the fiber of a surface bundle such that dehn filling along rational slopes in that neighborhood produces closed manifolds with taut foliations .",
    "the notion of ` sufficiently close ' in corollary [ maincor ] can however be bounded below for a given manifold .",
    "deleting a neighbourhood of the binding in the baldwin - etnyre examples gives a surface bundle and using the techniques developed in the previous sections we now calculate a neighborhood of multislopes realized by taut foliations , around the multislope of the fiber in this fibration .",
    "in particular , we observe that this neighbourhood does not contain the meridional multislope .",
    "so dehn filling along these slopes does not give a taut foliation of the sequence of baldwin - etnyre manifolds , as is to be expected .",
    "the following is a description of the baldwin - etnyre examples@xcite .",
    "let @xmath239 denote the genus one surface with two boundary components , @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "let @xmath242 be the diffeomorphisms of @xmath239 given by the product of dehn twists , @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are the curves shown in figure [ baldwinetnyre ] ( reproduced from figure 1 of baldwin - etnyre@xcite ) .",
    "then @xmath242 is pseudo - anosov by a well - known construction of penner @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 are curves parallel to the boundary components @xmath240 and @xmath241 of @xmath239 .",
    "let @xmath249 be the open book @xmath250 ) .",
    "let @xmath251 , @xmath252 be regular neighbourhoods of @xmath253 and @xmath254 in @xmath255 and let @xmath256 .",
    "let @xmath257 , @xmath258 be the closed curves in @xmath259 represented by @xmath253 , @xmath254 , with induced orientation .",
    "the monodromy @xmath260 is freely isotopic to the pseudo - anosov map @xmath261 .",
    "let @xmath262 , @xmath263 be the suspension flow of a point in @xmath257 and @xmath258 respectively under the monodromy @xmath261 . as @xmath261 is the identity on @xmath264 , @xmath265 in @xmath266 for @xmath267 .      if @xmath271 is the meridional disk of a regular neigbourhood @xmath251 of @xmath253 in @xmath272 then @xmath273 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath274 a meridional disk of a regular neighbourhood of @xmath254 in @xmath255 , @xmath275 .    in order to express the monodromy of the surface bundle in terms of the gervais generators we use the pseudo - anosov monodromy @xmath276 which is freely isotopic to @xmath260 , with the observation that dehn filling @xmath277 along slopes @xmath278 and @xmath279 gives the manifold @xmath280 .",
    "so for @xmath277 we have @xmath281 , @xmath282 .",
    "as shown in theorem 1.16 of baldwin - etnyre@xcite , for any @xmath283 there exist @xmath284 such that the corresponding open book in @xmath285 has a compatible contact structure that is not a deformation of the tangent bundle of a taut foliation .",
    "we shall now show that the slope @xmath286 lies outside the interval of perturbation that gives slopes of taut foliations via our construction . and",
    "hence , the manifolds @xmath285 can not be obtained by capping off the taut foliations realized by our interval of boundary slopes around the fibration .    to obtain the branched surface required in our construction in the previous sections we need a good sequence of arcs @xmath287 where @xmath288 , @xmath289 .",
    "these arcs are used to construct product disks which we then smoothen along copies of the fiber surface to get the required branched surface .    following the method outlined in lemma [ lem : existence of good sequence ]",
    "we need to express @xmath290 in terms of the gervais generators .",
    "the curves @xmath291 , @xmath172 and @xmath16 correspond to the generating curves @xmath292 , @xmath188 and @xmath293 among the gervais generators as can be seen in figure [ gervais ] . we now need to express the curve @xmath245 in terms of these generating curves .",
    "let @xmath294 be a surface of genus @xmath295 and @xmath296 boundary components .",
    "consider a subsurface of @xmath294 homeomorphic to @xmath297 .",
    "then for curves @xmath298 , @xmath188 , @xmath299 as shown in the figure [ starrelation ] ( reproduced from figure 2 of gervais@xcite ) , the star - relation is @xmath300 where @xmath78 represents dehn - twist along the corresponding curves .",
    "let @xmath4 be the component of @xmath301 which is homeomorphic to a once - punctured torus .",
    "let @xmath302 and @xmath303 , @xmath304 be curves bounding disjoint disks @xmath80 and @xmath81 in @xmath4 so that @xmath305 is homeomorphic to @xmath297 . as @xmath306 are trivial in @xmath239 , @xmath302 and @xmath307 , so the star relation reduces to @xmath308 .",
    "hence , the monodromy @xmath242 in terms of the gervais generators is the word @xmath309 which gives us @xmath310 take arcs @xmath311 , @xmath312 as shown in figure [ gervais ] , where @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "then as @xmath316 is a negatively oriented pair and @xmath317 , @xmath318 so we have a negatively oriented good sequence @xmath319 obtained by taking the sequence of arcs @xmath320",
    "@xmath321    let @xmath162 be the branched surface corresponding to this good oriented sequence as in definition [ associated branched surface ] .",
    "the weighted train track @xmath322 on the boundary torii is as shown in figure [ finaltt ] .      when the monodromy is @xmath325 ( instead of @xmath242 ) , by a similar argument , we get the slope of the measured lamination on the boundary as @xmath326 so that the interval of slopes realized by taut foliations is @xmath327 . and we observe that the point @xmath328 , i.e , the taut foliations from our construction can not be capped off to give a taut foliation of the baldwin - etnyre examples ."
