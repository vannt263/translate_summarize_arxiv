    "moreover , because operator @xmath98 is a parity even operator , its eigenfunctions present a defined parity , so the normalized eigenfunctions can be written as : @xmath99 where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 represents the cylindrical bessel function of order @xmath102 these functions are specified by the set of quantum number @xmath103 , where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 denotes the value of the total angular quantum number , @xmath107 determines its projection .",

    "although we have developed this formalism for a six - dimensional spacetime , it can be adapted to a four and five dimensional space .",
    "the reason resides in the representations for the dirac matrices in these dimensions . for four dimensions a irreducible representation for the flat dirac matrices",
    "is the well known @xmath39 ones , so we may use @xmath117 . as a consequence , in the corresponding analysis we have to discard the derivative with respect to the coordinates @xmath73 and @xmath118 in the operator @xmath119 . for a five dimensions a possible representation for the flat dirac matrices is also @xmath39 which can be given by @xmath120 . in this case",

    "now we are in position to obtain the bispinor @xmath124 , which is given by @xmath125 finally substituting ( [ phi - n ] ) into ( [ ge ] ) with @xmath126 , we obtain with the help of @xcite a closed expression to the euclidean green function : @xmath127 where @xmath128 being @xmath129 and @xmath130 a @xmath131 matrix .",
    "@xmath132 is the associated legendre function .",
    "we can express this function in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite by : @xmath133 in this analysis we identify the parameter @xmath134 with @xmath135 and take @xmath136 .",
    "so the relevant hypergeometric function is @xmath137 if @xmath2 is a even number , this function becomes a polynomial of degree @xmath138 ; however being @xmath2 an odd number , this function is an infinite series .",

    "for @xmath144 the only term that contributes to ( [ ge1 ] ) in the summation is @xmath145 . for @xmath146",
    "both associated legendre functions contribute , @xmath147 . using the explicit expressions for the spinor spherical harmonics , and using the addition theorem for the spherical harmonics , it is possible to express ( [ ge1 ] ) by : @xmath148 now taking @xmath149 and using the sum of legendre functions and polynomials @xcite , we obtain standard expressions for the green function .",

    "the fermionic green function , @xmath156 , can be given by applying the dirac operator on the bispinor ( [ ge1 ] ) according to ( [ s ] ) .",
    "in this section we shall calculate in a explicit way , the renormalized vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath157 . because the metric tensor does not depend of any dimensional parameter , and also because we are working with natural units system",
    ", we can infer that the vev of the energy - momentum tensor depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath158 .",
    "moreover , due to the nonvanishing of riemann and ricci tensor , and scalar curvature of the spacetime , this vev also depends on the arbitrary mass scale , @xmath20 , introduced by the renormalization prescription .",
    "so , by dimensional analysis it is expected that @xmath159 where the tensors @xmath160 and @xmath161 depends only on the parameter @xmath23 . because the presence of the arbitrary cutoff scale , @xmath20 , there is an ambiguity in the definition of ( [ t ] ) . finally for a spacetime of odd dimension ,",
    "i.e. , for a even value of @xmath2 , @xmath162 . obviously the tensors are diagonal and due to the spherical symmetry of the problem we should have @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",

    "this makes this function proportional to the unit matrix @xmath42 .",
    "so , only the term with time derivative in ( [ do ] ) provides a nonvanishing contribution for the zero - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "now after these brief comments about general properties of the vev of the energy - momentum tensor , we shall start the explicit calculation of this quantity , specifying the values for @xmath2 .      for @xmath150 ,",

    "cc    finally we would like to mention that the model analysed here presents monopole as a point - like object having its core on the flat brane ; so the influence due to the fermionic quantum field on the brane can be evaluated in the region near the monopole s core .",
    "however , by this model the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor is divergent at the monopole s core .",
    "the problem of the singularity of vacuum polarization effects involving a global monopole , and topological deffects in general , can be avoided by considering a more realistic model to the monopole , i.e. , considering a inner structure to its core .",
    "a simplified model for the monopole core has been first presented in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum polarization effects due to a massless scalar field in the region outside this model have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "more recently the analysis of vacuum polarization effect associated with quantum bosonic and fermionic fields , in the global monopole spacetime with a general spherically symmetric inner structure , have been developed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in these analysis the asymptotic behavior of the core - induced vacuum densities",
    "are investigated at large and small distance from the core , and for small a large angle solid deficit .",
    "the author would like to thank j. batista fonseca , for his help with the computer program grtensorii and to aram a. saharian , also to conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq . ) for partial financial support , fapesq - pb / cnpq .",

    "in order to find the complete expression for ( [ gr ] ) , it is necessary to obtain the derivative of @xmath222 and @xmath223 with respect to @xmath225 .",
    "our first steps in this direction is to introduced a new variable @xmath285 .",
    "so we may write : @xmath286 with @xmath287 consequently @xmath288 because the integrand of @xmath222 is divergent at the point @xmath289 , we have to change the variable @xmath290 before applying the leibnitz formula for derivative of an integral .",
    "so , this derivative can be written as @xmath291 where @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath223 is simple and reads @xmath294    using these results we can express the renormalized green function , eq .",

    "taking the coincidence limits @xmath296 and @xmath297 , using the fact that @xmath298 , and adopting the same procedure as explained above we can write @xmath299 taking the limit @xmath300 we obtain @xmath301 we can see that the integral above is finite because for small values of @xmath73 , @xmath302 . in the limit @xmath300 , the other relevant terms in the renormalized green function above provide @xmath303    so taking into account all these results and including the additional term ( [ aa ] ) we have : @xmath304\\alpha^4}{128\\pi^3r^6}+\\frac{3\\alpha^4 } { 32\\pi^3r^6}\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{dx}{x^5}\\frac1{\\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{{\\rm arcsinh(x/\\sqrt{2})}}\\alpha\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\      & + & \\frac{3\\alpha^4 } { 32\\pi^3r^6}\\int_0 ^ 1\\frac{dx}{x^5}f_1(x)+\\frac{3{\\bar{a}}_3\\alpha^4}{32\\pi^6r^6}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu r}\\alpha\\right ) -\\frac1{64\\pi^3r^6}\\alpha^4{\\bar{a}}_3 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be written as shown below : @xmath305    100 k. akama , _ pregeometry _ in lecture notes in physics , 176 , gauge theory and gravitation , proceedings , nara , 1982 , edited by k. kikkawa , n. nakanishi and h. nariai , 267 - 271 ( springer - verlag,1983 ) , hep - th/0001113 . l. randal and r. sundrum , phys . rev .",
