    "super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) are considered to be one of the major building blocks of the universe .",
    "most nearby galaxies are seen to harbour a smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the milky way @xcite , and it is found that the mass of the smbh is tightly connected to properties of the bulge of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the growth of a black hole to reach a mass of @xmath5 must include a phase of rapid accretion , i.e. an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; * ? ? ? * ) , unless it forms from an already massive primordial black hole ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this has implications for the formation and growth of galaxies and other structures in the universe ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore a complete census of agn in the universe is essential in order to study its evolution .",
    "the most efficient way to detect an agn is through its high - energy emission detected in the x - rays .",
    "the deepest x - ray surveys with _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ @xcite have detected a large number of agn , with a surface density tens of times higher than that found in optical surveys @xcite .",
    "a representative sample of agn in the universe over different scales and redshifts can be drawn by combining deep pencil - beam surveys with wider , intermediate - depth surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and shallow large - area surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of the agn detected in the x - rays show some level of obscuration @xcite , but the hard x - rays ( @xmath6 ) can easily penetrate large columns of obscuring material in cases where the dominant x - ray absorption mechanism is photoelectric absorption , because of the strong dependance of its cross - section on the photon energy ( @xmath7 ) . however , when the column density of the obscuring material reaches @xmath8 ( i.e. the inverse of the thomson cross - section for electrons , @xmath9 ) it becomes optically thick to compton scattering , the relativistic equivalent of thomson scattering applied at higher energies , which has a lower dependancy with energy .",
    "such sources are called compton - thick ( ct ) agn and even high - energy photons are obscured .",
    "if the column density is @xmath10 we can still detect some x - ray photons from the source , with a hard spectrum peaking at @xmath11 , where the compton and photoelectric cross - sections are equal ( transmission - dominated ct agn ) .",
    "if the column density is even higher , any detected x - ray emission comes from a reflected component at the back side of the obscuring torus ( reflection - dominated ct agn ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giving a characteristic flat x - ray spectrum , with an observed luminosity typically a few percent of the intrinsic agn luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases a soft ( @xmath12 ) component scattered",
    "possibly from electrons in the narrow - line region is also detected in lower x - ray energies ( @xmath13 ; see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which is a blend of photo - ionised lines @xcite .",
    "the fact that the observed x - ray emission from ct agn is only a fraction of the intrinsic emission , even at the highest energies detected by x - ray telescopes , makes them challenging to detect in even the deepest x - ray surveys .",
    "therefore , other techniques have been developed , that use the combination of a low detected x - ray luminosity ( or even a non - detection ) with secondary processes taking place in the agn .",
    "the most widely used methods employ optical ( or near - infrared ) spectroscopy focusing on high - excitation spectral lines coming from the narrow - line region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in this paper we will use the mid - infrared emission , which is easier to apply to wide fields .",
    "the mid - infrared emission from the agn is due to the obscuring dust heated by the agn x - ray and ultra - violet emission .",
    "however dust is also abundantly found around massive o ",
    "b stars in the host galaxies , and is heated by their ultra - violet radiation , making infrared emission also a star - formation tracer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to differentiate between the two different generators of infrared emission , we must take into account the high energy produced by the agn , which heats the dust to higher temperatures than o  b stars and gives a characteristic power - law spectrum in the mid - infrared @xcite and peaks at @xmath14 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) by their low x - ray to infrared luminosity ratio , utilising the empirical intrinsic @xmath15 relation @xcite .",
    "the low @xmath15 selection technique has not been widely used in broad surveys , because of the lack of mir observations covering a large part of the sky . before the advent of _",

    "we will also use a new sed decomposition technique to isolate the mid - infrared emission from the agn and thus minimise the host galaxy contamination . we will then test the efficiency of the low x - ray to mid - infrared luminosity method by examining the x - ray and optical spectral properties of the candidate sources , and comparing their number with what expected form x - ray background synthesis models .",
    "we adopt @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 throughout the paper .",
    "we use the x - ray catalogue compiled by @xcite , which contains about 40000 x - ray point - sources over an area of 122deg@xmath19 , with a half - area detection limit of @xmath20 in the 0.510kev band and @xmath21 in the 210kev band .",
    "this survey uses _ xmm  newton _ pointings which coincide with the sdss dr7 @xcite , and we use it in order to have optical and near - infrared photometric information , as well as a spectroscopic or photometric redshift for our candidates",

    "all _ xmm  newton _ observations performed prior to july 2009 , overlapping with the sdss have been used in the analysis , and x - ray photometry is provided in five bands , including the 0.52.0kev and 28kev , hereafter `` soft '' and `` hard '' bands , respectively , that we investigate here .      for the ( mid-)infrared identification of our candidates , we use the all - sky source catalogue of _ wise _ @xcite .",
    "this is a space telescope launched in december 2009 , operating in the mid - infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "it has a 40 cm primary mirror and performed an all - sky survey in the 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22@xmath22 bands , reaching @xmath23 point source sensitivities of 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 and 6mjy , or lower , depending on the position in the sky .",
    "the fwhm of the psfs are 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 12.0for the four bands respectively , which is comparable to that of _ xmm  newton _",
    "( @xmath24 , depending on the instrument and off - axis angle ) , allowing us to perform a reliable search for counterparts between the two telescopes .",
    "we use the magnitudes measured with profile - fitting photometry , and the zero points of @xcite .",
    "the x - ray sample of @xcite contains 39830 x - ray sources within the footprint of the sdss dr7 survey .",
    "@xcite use the likelihood ratio method to find optical counterparts for the x - ray sources . at a limit of @xmath25",
    "they find a counterpart for almost half of x - ray sources ( 19431/39830 ) with an expected spurious identification rate of 7% .",
    "the probability that an x - ray source has an optical counterpart is strongly dependent on the x - ray flux , and is typically @xmath26 for sources with @xmath27 and @xmath28 for sources with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "a redshift determination requires a spectroscopic follow - up in the optical ( or the near - infrared ) and a good enough quality spectrum , which is the case for the brightest optical sources ( typically with @xmath30 ) .",
    "we note that in addition to sdss spectroscopy , a number of optical spectroscopic programs were used in @xcite , so there are sources with optical spectra with magnitudes exceeding the @xmath31 limit , but not with uniform coverage in terms of spatial distribution , or source type .",
    "in addition to spectroscopic redshifts , a source might have a photometric redshift determination , if it is detected in enough optical and near - infrared bands .",
    "the typical detection limits for the sdss dr7 are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "only half of the sdss - detected x - ray sources have a redshift determination ( 9029/19431 ) , 2172 of them spectroscopic .    in identifying heavily obscured sources by their low x - ray to infrared ratio ,",
    "it is possible that the sample will be contaminated by a number of normal galaxies , i.e. x - ray sources that do not host an agn , and their x - ray flux is attributed to star - formation .",
    "the normalisation of the x - ray to infrared relation for star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is 12 orders of magnitude lower than the x - ray to infrared ratio of typical agn ( see sect .  [ contamination ] ) , so normal galaxies could be mistaken for highly obscured agn . to minimise this effect , we limit our x - ray sample to those x - ray sources that are detected in the hard band ( 28kev ) , so that we are able to have an initial hint of the shape of the x - ray spectrum through the hardness ratio , without having to analyse all the spectra prior to the candidate selection .",
    "4553/9029 x - ray sources with a redshift determination are detected in the hard band .",
    "we look for counterparts to the 4553 x - ray sources described in the previous section in the _ wise _ all - sky catalogue . because at the flux limits of both _",
    "xmm  newton _ and _ wise _",
    "the confusion of the sources is minimal ( within 5arcsec of the x - ray positions there are 4100 _ wise _ counterparts with seven duplicates ) , we use a simple proximity criterion to select the counterparts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to have an estimate of the number of spurious counterparts , we initially select sources from the _ wise _ catalogue that are within 60arcsec of the x - ray positions . in figure[draddec ] we plot the histograms of the difference in ra and dec of the counterparts , and in red we plot gaussians fitted to the distributions .",
    "we find a mean @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are consistent with the astrometric accuracies of the _ xmm  newton _ catalogue ( @xmath36 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nominal astrometric accuracy of the _ wise _ all - sky catalogue is @xmath37arcsec at the faintest fluxes .",
    "we correct the positional differences between the sources of the two catalogues by the above mean values .",
    "+    next , we estimate the number of spurious counterpart matches .",
    "given the distributions of figure[draddec ] and the gaussian fits , we can assume that most of the counterparts with dra and ddec greater than 6arcsec ( @xmath38 ) are chance matches . in order not to include any real counterparts",
    "when assessing the spurious ratio , we measure the number of matches with distances of 2040arcsec , and find 14861 cases .",
    "therefore , the density of spurious counterparts in the dra ",
    "ddec space is 3.9arcsec@xmath39 . in figure[distances ] we plot the histogram of the distances of all the counterparts .",
    "we model this with a rayleigh distribution with an amplitude set to be the mean of the amplitudes of the two gaussian distributions and parameter @xmath40 ( dotted line ) .",
    "we also add the expected number of spurious counterparts calculated above ( dashed line ) .",
    "the sum of those two distributions is plotted with the solid curve in figure[distances ] .",
    "we over - predict the number of counterparts with distances 512arcsec , and we attribute this difference to the finite psf of the _ wise _ survey : if there is a _ wise _ source detected close to the position of the x - ray source ( being the `` true '' counterpart ) , another detection is unlikely in its immediate vicinity ( 512arcsec ) , which would be the spurious counterpart , because of the blending of their psfs . the two sources would become distinguishable if their distance is more than two times the fwhm of the psf and in _ wise _ this is 12arcsec . with the green histogram in figure  [ distances ] we plot the distribution of unique counterparts , choosing the nearest case , and",
    "this is almost identical with the black histogram below 5arcsec .",
    "the two distributions ( rayleigh of `` correct '' counterparts and linear of spurious ) meet at 4.3arcsec , and choosing a limiting radius larger than that would give more chance matches than true counterparts . since in this study",
    "we are searching for a rare type of object ( given the high flux density limits ) , we are more conservative and use 3.5arcsec as our limiting radius , indicated by the grey area in figure  [ distances ] . within this radius",
    "we find 3689 ( 3685 unique ) matches between the _ xmm  newton _ and _ wise _ catalogues , and the number of spurious counterparts expected within this radius is 150 ( 4.1% ) .",
    "we do not find a _ wise _",
    "counterpart for 868 sources , something that might introduce a bias in the selection of obscured agn ( see section[ctnumber ] ) .",
    "however , such cases have by definition high x - ray to mid - infrared luminosity ratios and would not be selected as candidates , even if the infrared lower limits were such that they would be detected .",
    "we select our sample of candidate heavily - obscured agn based on the x - ray to mid - infrared rest - frame luminosity ratio .",
    "@xcite , exploring the nuclear x - ray ( @xmath41 ) and mid - infrared ( @xmath42 ) properties of a sample of nearby seyferts , found a correlation between their rest - frame luminosities , when correcting the x - ray fluxes for internal absorption and using high angular resolution in the mid - infrared to resolve out the host emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this correlation is thought to be characteristic of agn , and any deviations from it ( in the form of an infrared excess ) should arise from severe obscuration of the x - ray photons .",
    "this assumption has been used in the past to select heavily obscured agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and although the samples acquired are not complete , they are reliable ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the sense that the majority of selected sources have indications of being heavily obscured , especially in the local universe .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the host galaxy is a contaminant of the mid - infrared flux , which affects relatively low luminosity agn ; these can be mistaken for obscured agn , whereas in reality they are  low agn - to - host infrared sources .",
    "to avoid such cases , we de - compose the infrared seds of the sources in our sample , as explained below .      for the x - ray luminosities we use the @xmath41 fluxes from the catalogue of @xcite and a photon index @xmath43 for the k - corrections to obtain rest - frame @xmath41 luminosities .",

    "to calculate the mid - infrared luminosities , we use all the near- and mid - infrared information provided by _ wise _ : the photometry in the four _ wise _ bands ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and @xmath44 ) , as well as the photometry in the three 2mass bands ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) for detected sources .",

    "we are interested in the mid - infrared luminosity from the agn and the host galaxy is a potential contaminant that can not be resolved by _ wise _ , we de - compose the infrared sed into an agn and a galaxy component .",
    "we use a custom - built maximum likelihood method to find an optimum combination of a semi - empirical galaxy template from @xcite , with an agn template of @xcite , and measure the @xmath49 monochromatic luminosity ( @xmath50 ) from the agn template .",
    "we do this to sources with a photometric detection in at least three of the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 bands , since we use the combination of two templates , and this selection limits the number of sources from 3685 to 2844 .",
    "we combine the photometric errors given in the _ wise _",
    "( and/or the 2mass extended ) catalogue with a 10%-level error of the photometric value in quadrature , to account for the intrinsic error on the sed templates used .",

    "when trying to decompose the seds using multiple components and a limited number of data - points , we are expecting degeneracies between the different fitted components .",
    "therefore , in order to have an estimate of the uncertainty of the @xmath50 value calculated , for every trial fit we plot the @xmath49 flux of the agn template against the ( log ) likelihood referring to it in the left panels of figure[sed_figures ] .",
    "an example of reliable and unreliable estimates of @xmath50 , as well as the sed combination with the highest likelihood , are shown in figure[sed_figures ] : the right panels show the composite best - fitting sed with the grey line , using the combination of the galaxy ( red ) and agn ( blue ) templates that give the maximum likelihood value . in this case",
    "we do not use any priors in the maximum likelihood estimation , so the difference in the natural logarithms of the likelihoods is equivalent to the difference in @xmath55 of the fits . with the dashed lines on the left plots we indicate the @xmath55 differences from the best fit corresponding to 68.3% , 95.4% , and 99.7% ( or 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath56 ) confidence levels . in order to check whether the agn template is indeed needed , we plot the likelihood values of a single - template fit using only the host template in the far - left column of the likelihood plots . for the cases shown in figure[sed_figures ]",
    "this is visible only in the lower panel , where the likelihood values are comparable to the ones of the fits involving two templates . in this case",
    "it indicates that a solution with no agn template is almost as likely as the best solution involving the combination of two templates , therefore the agn template is not statistically important assuming a @xmath57 confidence level ; its significance is slightly higher than @xmath58 according to figure[sed_figures ] .",

    ", we expect 23 and 342 compton - thick and heavily obscured agn respectively .",
    "these numbers are well above the numbers found in the previous paragraph ( 25 and 1219 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained if there are highly obscured sources that do not present a low x - ray to mid - infrared luminosity ratio , and therefore they are not selected by our selection procedure .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another factor which we have to include when assessing the number of heavily obscured agn found with the low x - ray to mid - infrared luminosity method is the scatter in the x - ray to mid - infrared flux relation .",

    "we find a scatter in the @xmath2 relation of 0.5dex , larger that found both by citedgandhi2009 and @xcite .",
    "part of our scatter can be introduced by x - ray absorption , which is not corrected for , and another part is a result of the @xmath43 assumption made in calculating the x - ray luminosities .",
    "comparing the x - ray luminosities in tables[candidates ] and [ plfits ] we can see that in some cases they can differ up to one order of magnitude . removing this source of scatted would require fitting the x - ray spectra of all the 2844 sources , which is not feasible .",
    "we have removed it for 14 sources of our sample and indeed five of them are no longer low x - ray to mid - infrared candidates , but we do not have information on how many sources would make it into the mid - infrared selected sample if we corrected all the sources .    in summary , the x - ray to mid - infrared luminosity ratio technique is somewhat reliable for finding obscured sources i.e. most low x - ray to ir luminosity sources have large amounts of obscuration",
    ". however , the technique suffers from incompleteness , because of the selection made in optical  infrared wavelengths and because of scatter of the @xmath2 relation , introduced by observational constrains .",
    "in this work we combine the _ xmm_sdss survey with the all - sky mid - infrared survey of _ wise _ to select highly obscured agn .",
    "we use only sources detected in the hard x - ray band ( 210kev ) in order to have an initial estimate of the hardness ratio and therefore avoid normal galaxies , whose x - ray emission does not originate from an agn and have similar x - ray to infrared luminosity ratios to heavily obscured agn , and other unobscured sources .",
    "we also use only x - ray sources that have an sdss counterpart bright enough to provide a spectroscopic or photometric redshift , and with a detection in at a least three bands with _ wise _ and 2mass to be able to perform sed fitting .",

    "this number is a factor of 20 less than what would be expected from x - ray background population synthesis models for heavily obscured agn , and a factor of five for compton - thick agn .",
    "we attribute those differences on the initial selection method been based on a relatively high mid - infrared luminosity and an optical detection , characteristics not shared by many obscured agn , and the scatter of the @xmath2 relation , mostly introduced by observational constraints .",

    ", we have three sets of templates , codenamed `` stellar '' , `` sb '' , and `` agn '' . for the stellar templates , we use the @xcite stellar population models , with solar metallicity and a range of star - formation histories and ages ; in total we use 75 templates .",
    "we then redden each template using a @xcite dust extinction law , with a range of @xmath71 from 0 to 2 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "this gives us a library of 1500 synthetic stellar templates .",
    "for the sb templates we use the library of @xcite ( 105 templates ) , or the library of @xcite ( 5 templates ) , which we crop at rest - frame wavelengths below @xmath72 in order not to duplicate the stellar population , since it is the main contributor in the optical  near - infrared wavelengths in the @xcite templates . for the agn templates we use the library of @xcite , which includes five templates",
    ": four of them are `` torus '' templates with varying extinction ranging form @xmath73 to @xmath74 and the fifth is the @xmath73 template with a blue bump .",
    "we use a monte - carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) sampling method for the sed fitting , taking into consideration all the possible combinations of templates ( @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) . for each combination , we calculate the minimum and maximum contribution of each component , we reduce the minimum contribution by a factor of 100 , and use this range to vary the contribution of each template with the mcmc sampling . for each `` test combination '' we calculate the likelihood using equation[basic_equation ] . as the best - fit we keep the combination and normalisation that gives the maximum likelihood .",
    "we keep the likelihood values of all trial fits and we plot their natural logarithm ( log - likelihood ) against key values corresponding to the given combination and normalisations .",
    "examples of such plots are given in figure[sed_figures ]  left panel .    in the general case",
    "we do not use any prior information in our sed fits , and if we use the natural logarithm of equation[basic_equation ] , it becomes : @xmath77-\\sum_{i}\\left[\\frac{\\left(f_{i}-f_{i}^{m}\\right)^{2}}{2\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right]=c(d)-\\frac{\\chi^{2}}{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is a constant depending only on the data , and @xmath55 is the chi - square statistic of each trial fit . translating this to the @xmath55 difference between the best - fitting model ( which also has the lowest @xmath55 ) and a trial fit",
    ", we get : @xmath79 so we can use the log - likelihood differences between the trial fits and the best fit to estimate the 1-@xmath56 , 2-@xmath56 and 3-@xmath56 confidence intervals of a value in question using @xmath80 respectively , which corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "these are the horizontal dashed lines in figure[sed_figures ]  left panel .    for some cases where we are detecting a point - source in the sdss images",
    ", we have a prior information , that the bulk of the flux in some filter comes form the agn .",
    "we quantify the probability density of this information by assuming a gaussian distribution of the calculated flux density of the agn component with a @xmath56 equal to 10% of the value .",
    "we then multiply each trial likelihood with this prior and get : @xmath82\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\left(f_{i}-f_{i , agn}^{m}\\right)^{2}}{2\\left(\\sigma_{i , agn}^{m}\\right)^2}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is now the bayesian likelihood . in this case",
