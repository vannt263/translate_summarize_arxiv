    "over these last several years , there has been significant progress in the production of ultracold gases which realize the bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , degenerate atomic fermi gases @xcite , and bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "these systems offer great promise for studies of new , interesting driven - phenomena .",
    "one of the most exciting themes in recent physics is to study the time - dependent dynamical motion of trapped atoms , such as collective oscillations @xcite , quantum vortices @xcite and atomic novae @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , these phenomena are very important , as they allow us to construct and examine the transport theory in finite many body systems .",
    "many body atomic systems are good probes for such study because the fundamental interactions are well understood and can be changed using the feshbach resonance @xcite .    of the above phenomena collective oscillations",
    "are very sensitive to properties of the system and therefore are condensates for studying time - dependent dynamics .",
    "the collective oscillation of becs have been studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there have been theoretical studies of the fermi gas in the normal phase @xcite and in the superconducting phase @xcite , as well as the bose - fermi mixed gases @xcite and the bec - bcs crossover @xcite .",
    "collective motions are usually studied with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the rpa however , can only describe minimal vibrations around ground state ; for example it is shown in ref.@xcite that the radial variation is only about 0.05 % , while the amplitudes of actual experimental can be as large as 10 % .    to describe collective oscillations with larger amplitudes we need to calculate the time evolution of the system using the time - dependent gross - pitaevsky ( tdgp ) and time - dependent hartree fock ( tdhf ) equations . in atomic gas systems , however , the fermion number is greater than one thousand , but it is not easy to solve the tdhf equations with so many fermions and limited computer resources . for system with large fermion number , on the other hand , the semi - classical approximation ( @xmath0 ) becomes useful , and the vlasov equation , corresponding to the semi - classical approximation of the tdhf equations , can be used",
    ".    in nuclear physics @xcite the vlasov - uhling - uhlenbeck ( vuu ) approach , which is the vlasov plus two body collision with the pauli blocking , has been introduced , and very nicely explained many kinds of observables in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "in addition , this approach has been developed for the lorentz covariant framework including the non - local mean - fields @xcite .",
    "as for the boson gas the time evolution of condensed bosons and thermal bosons have also been described with the time - dependent gross - pitaevsky equation and the boltzmann equation @xcite . furthermore c.  menotti et al .",
    "@xcite studied the expansion of a fermi gas by calculating the vlasov equation with the scaling method .    in this work",
    "we construct a transport model including the condensed bosons and fermions based on the tdgp and vlasov equations . as a first step we study the collective monopole motion of a the spherically symmetric system at zero temperature .",
    "this calculation is a good test for the comparison between the rpa and direct time evolution calculations .",
    "in addition one pays attention to the monopole oscillation from the point of the view of the collapse so as to know compressing processes of systems @xcite .    in section 2",

[ rmtdf2 ]",
    "we show the time - dependence of @xmath83 ( a ) and @xmath84 ( b ) with the initial conditions @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) ( in - phase ) .",

    "the condensed bosons oscillate independently of the fermions , so that the difference between @xmath83 at these three initial conditions is not visible .    in the above three cases",
    "we see that the fermion oscillations are forced vibrations with a beat , which gradually becomes blurred .",
    "this blurring can not be explained within the rpa .    before discussing this blurring we calculate with another initial condition : @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) . with this initial condition",
    "the boson oscillation is weak and does not strongly affect the fermion oscillation , see fig .",
    "[ rmtc1 ] .",
    "the boson oscillation has a beat which appears in early time and blurs in latter time stages , and the fermion oscillation has a strong damping . in fig .",
    "[ rmtc1]c we show the results of the calculation at the same initial condition , but with the boson motion frozen ; namely the fermions move in the fixed potential @xmath95 in the ground state .",
    "the damping behavior of the fermion oscillation is almost the same as that in fig .",
    "[ rmtc1]b , except that the fermion oscillation is monotonously damped while the oscillation in fig .",
    "[ rmtc1]b undergoes one beat .",
    "this damping process causes the blurring beat in the fermion oscillation shown in fig .",
    "[ rmtdf2 ] .",
    "hence this damping process must play a significant role in collective motions in the boson - fermion mixtures .",
    "next we inspect the origin of the damping by focusing on monopole motions with the initial condition @xmath93 . here",
    "we examine the time - evolution of the energy levels . in fig .",
    "[ engp1 ] we show the time - dependence of @xmath96 ( long - dashed ) , @xmath97 ( dashed ) and @xmath98 ( solid ) , which are defined in eqs.([etot]@xmath99[ebf ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath100 corresponds to the sum of the fermion single particle energy .",
    "first we note that the boson - fermion interaction part , @xmath98 , is much smaller than the boson part , @xmath101 , and the fermion part , @xmath102 .",
    "second the boson part @xmath101 and the fermion part , @xmath103 , do not significantly vary in the time - evolution process . after the damping ( @xmath104 ) the energies , normalized by @xmath105 , are given as @xmath106 where the values in the brackets indicate the energy contribution to the ground state .",
    "the excited energy of the fermions is about 300 ( @xmath105 ) while the energy transfer is about 70 ( @xmath105 ) through the boson - fermion interaction .",
    "this fact implies that the damping is not caused by the fermion energy loss , and in addition that this oscillation state is a many - particle many - hole state because the excited energy of the one - particle and one - hole states is about @xmath107 in the monopole oscillations .",
    "further we calculate the spectrum which is obtained by the fourier transformation @xmath108 in order discuss the oscillations , we vary @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    in fig .",
    "[ specta ] we show the results of the spectra obtained by integrating over the regions @xmath111 ( damping period ) for the bosons ( a ) and fermions ( b ) , and over @xmath112 ( after damping ) for the bosons ( c ) and fermions ( d ) .",
    "in addition we plot the spectra for fermion oscillation with the boson motion frozen , with the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ specta]b and [ specta]d .    in fig .",
    "[ specta]b we see that the peak position for the fermion spectrum is @xmath113 , and does not vary in any of the time regions while the width becomes slightly narrower after the damping is finished ( fig .",
    "[ specta]d ) .",
    "on the other hand there are two peaks for the boson spectra ; at the frequency @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the fermion damping process . after the damping , there is only one boson oscillation mode at @xmath115 , similar to the fermion oscillation .",
    "we can consider the intrinsic frequencies of the boson and fermion oscillations to be @xmath116 and @xmath117 in our calculation .",
    "the boson intrinsic frequency agrees with @xmath118 which has been shown in the system only including the condensed bosons @xcite .",
    "the boson intrinsic mode is almost independent of fermions because the boson number is much larger than the fermion number .",
    "in addition the frequency of the fermion oscillation is the same with or without the boson motion .    in the short time period",
    "both the boson and fermion oscillations can be approximately described within the linear response theory as @xmath119 if the amplitude of the boson oscillation in the initial condition is not small , the boson oscillation negligibly involves a mode with the fermion intrinsic frequency , @xmath120 , and the fermion oscillation becomes the usual forced oscillation @xmath121 as shown in fig .",
    "[ rmtdf2 ] .    when @xmath122 such as in fig .",
    "[ rmtc1 ] , the fermion oscillation does not have a mode with the boson frequency ( @xmath123 ) . in the beginnings",
    "these fermion oscillations trigger the boson oscillations , and then the boson oscillations dominantly hold the mode with the fermion frequency , @xmath124 . as the time evolves , the amplitude of the boson oscillation becomes larger , but the amplitude of the fermion oscillation contrarily decreases , and the @xmath125 is gradually reduced by the damping of the fermion oscillation .",
    "the amplitude of the fermion oscillation becomes too small to influence the boson oscillation , the boson oscillation loses the mode with the fermion frequency , and its beat finally disappears .",
    "the behavior of the fermion oscillation in the full calculation is the same as that when the boson motion is frozen , and the fermions do not lose energy through oscillation . hence the fermions move almost independently each of other , and",
    "the damping of the fermion oscillations must come from properties of the fermion single particle motion .",
    "the boson density is distributed in a smaller region than the fermion density , so the fermion potential does not have simple harmonic oscillator shape , which is shown with the solid line in fig .",
    "[ grdpot ] .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation , which is available in the case of the large boson number , gives the boson density as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the boson chemical potential .",
    "then the fermion potential @xmath128 is approximately written as @xmath129 thus the fermion potential is separated into two region , the inside and outside of the boson populated region .    in the single harmonic oscillator potential",
    "the fermion motion is always harmonic in both the semi - classical and quantum approaches , but the above fermion potential , which is separated into the two regions , leads to anharmonicity when fermions move in the both regions .    in the quantum calculation",
    "this damping is explained with the phase factor of the fermion single particle wave functions given by their single particle energies .",
    "if the boson motion is frozen , the wave - function of the @xmath130-th fermion is written as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the wave - function of the @xmath75-th orbit of the ground state , @xmath133 is its single particle energy , and @xmath134 is a coefficient .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath135 is @xmath136 with @xmath137 this coefficient is usually negligible when @xmath138 , and then @xmath139 when the fermion potential is only the harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath140 , and the oscillation of @xmath141 does not exhibit a damping . as shown before ,",
    "however , the fermion potential includes two kinds of harmonic oscillator potentials with the different frequency .",
    "in addition the potential in the boson region is not exactly that of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "then the difference of the single particle energies , @xmath142 , has dependence on @xmath75 , and the fermion monopole oscillation includes various vibration modes with different freqencies , and its oscillation shows a damping .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that an oscillation of population difference in two - component fermi gase has a damping because of a similar multimode dephasing .    in the semi - classical calculation , the frequencies of modes including the oscillation is continuous , though they are discrete in the full quantum calculation . in the system with large particle number",
    ", however , the semi - classical calculation well describes the time evolution of the phase space distribution . in the harmonic oscillator potential ,",
    "especially , this time evolution completely agrees with that in the quantum calculation because higher order terms with respect to @xmath143 @xcite , which are omitted in eq.([vlasov ] ) , exactly vanish .",
    "hence our calculations sufficiently describe the actual time - evolution in the mean - field level .    in numerical simulations such oscillation properties",
    "are described by motions of the test - particles .",
    "a test particle passes over both regions , inside and outside of the boson region .",
    "here we consider oscillation behavior of radial distance of this @xmath75-th test particles as @xmath144 . in a non - harmonic oscillator potential",
    "the period between successive maximum @xmath144 depends on the orbit .",
    "this anharmonicity gradually reduces the amplitude of @xmath145 .    as mentioned",
    "before , the amplitude is about @xmath146 in the rpa calculation and the excited energy is about @xmath107 . in the present calculation , however , the excited energy when @xmath87 ( @xmath147 ) is about @xmath148 .",
    "oscillation states such as those in the present calculation are multi - particle and multi - hole states . under an anharmonic potential ,",
    "all test - particles do not oscillate with the same period , and hence this anharmonicity is the cause of the observed damping of @xmath84 .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate the oscillation behavior by changing the initial amplitude of fermion oscillation , @xmath149 , and the boson - fermion couplings , @xmath11 .",
    "first we examine the amplitude dependence of the damping . in fig .",
    "[ rmamp1 ] we show the results with the initial conditions that @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( small amplitude ) .",
    "the excited energy of this oscillation is about 30 ( @xmath105 ) , which is still much larger than the one - particle one - hole excited energy .",
    "the strong damping also appears there even with such small amplitude oscillation , which becomes about @xmath152 after the damping .",
    "the test particle method can not however give sufficient accuracy to exactly describe oscillations with such small amplitudes after the damping .",
    "therefore , the more detailed study lies beyond the scope of this work .    in fig .",
    "[ rmamp2 ] we show the results with the initial conditions that @xmath150 and @xmath153 ( large amplitude ) ; we do not see such strong damping though the excitation energy is about 1800 ( @xmath105 ) . in fig .",
    "[ framp2 ] we show the spectra of the above boson and fermion oscillations for the large amplitude .",
    "the boson and fermion spectra have peaks at quite different frequencies .",
    "the boson spectrum has a large peak at the boson intrinsic frequency @xmath154 ( a ) , while the fermion one has a peak at @xmath155 ( b ) , which is the frequency of the monopole oscillation with only one harmonic oscillator potential . in the large amplitude oscillation",
    "most of the fermions have large kinetic energy in the central region and pass through this region quickly , so that the fermions mostly stay outside the boson density region .",
    "in large amplitude oscillations , therefore , the oscillation frequency agree with that only in the trapped potential and , the rapid damping does not appear .",
    "the final amplitude after the damping must be much larger than that when @xmath87 .",
    "next we vary the strength of the boson - fermion coupling @xmath11 , and perform calculations of the oscillation at the same initial condition @xmath93 and @xmath87 .",
    "we show the results with @xmath156 in fig .",
    "[ rmpp2 ] and @xmath157 in fig .",
    "[ rmpm1 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ rmpp2 ] the features of the oscillation which have been seen in fig .",
    "[ rmtc1 ] are more clear ; the damping of the fermion oscillation and the blur of the beat in the boson oscillation occurs sooner with @xmath158 than @xmath69 .",
    "if the boson - fermion coupling is negative , the oscillation behavior is a little different .",
    "when @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ rmpm1 ] , the fermion oscillation undergoes beating even after the motion is damped .",
    "additionally the amplitude of the boson oscillation is much larger than that of @xmath160 .",
    "this beat of the fermion oscillation after the damping is caused by the rather large amplitude of the boson oscillation .    as the repulsive interaction between bosons and fermions",
    "is increased , the damping of the fermion oscillation is faster , but the amplitude of the boson oscillations do not increase . in the attractive interaction , however , the damping is still rapid , but the amplitude of the boson oscillation is large .",
    "we believe this difference comes from the overlap region between boson and fermion densities .    when the fermions feel a repulsive force in the boson density region ( see fig .",
    "[ grdpot ] ) , the fermions stay outside of this boson region and have little influence on the boson oscillation",
    ". then the amplitude of the boson oscillation does not become larger , and its beat becomes blurred soon in spite of the stronger interaction .",
    "when the interaction is attractive , on the other hand , many fermions moves inside of the boson density region , and then boson and fermion motions are more significantly coupled .",
    "in this paper we study the collective monopole oscillation of bose - fermi mixtures , where the number of bosons is much larger than that of fermions , by solving directly the time - dependent equations .",
    "when the initial amplitude is about 10 % of the ground state rmsr , we find a rapid damping of the fermion oscillation and a beat in the bosonic vibration at the early time stage while this damping and beat almost disappear in the later time stage .",
    "this rapid damping does not exist at zero temperature in the system including only one kind of boson @xcite ; it is a typical feature in the bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "our analysis shows this damping is caused by the anharmonicity of the multi - particle and multi - hole states .",
    "since the fermion mean - field is separated into two parts , inside and outside of the boson density region , fermions feel very different forces in these two regions and their motions are not harmonic .",
    "then these motions becomes chaotic , and the oscillation amplitude decreases .    in this work we focus on the oscillation with the initial condition @xmath150 , where only the fermions have initial motion at the beginning . in this case",
    "we can clearly see damping properties of the fermion oscillation because the boson oscillation has very small amplitude .",
    "even if the amplitude of the initial boson oscillation is larger , the damping also plays a significant role .",
    "when the fermion oscillations have a large amplitude , it always tends to cause damping , but the amplitude after the damping is enhanced , again , by the boson oscillation .",
    "the fermion oscillation repeats the damping and enhancement , and its beat gradually blurs ; the oscillation behavior is not recursive .",
    "this damping process can not be described with rpa , where the motion is assumed to be harmonic .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite the excitation energy obtained in rpa corresponds to oscillations with the amplitude of @xmath161 of rmsr . in actual experiments , however , the amplitude is not so small , the oscillation states are multi - particle and multi - hole states , and hence we must solve the time - dependent process directly .    even if the boson - fermion interactions are attractive , both the boson and fermion oscillations have an oscillation behavior similar to those in the repulsive interaction in the damping time stage . in the attractive interaction , however , the amplitude of the boson oscillation slightly increases and the fermion oscillation has a small beat after the damping time stage .    in this work",
    "we do not show calculations with stronger attractive force between bosons and fermions .",
    "if the attractive force is stronger , the frequency of the fermion oscillation becomes larger , and finally agrees with that of the boson intrinsic oscillation ; where the two oscillation must make a resonance .",
    "we have investigated this phenomena , and found resonances which have quite different behaviors @xcite .",
    "furthermore we do not take into account two body collisions and thermal bosons .",
    "since two fermions do not directly interact , dissipation of fermions occurs through collisions between fermions and thermal bosons . in the system @xmath50 at zero temperature , however , the thermal bosons are very few , and then the damping process shown in this work must be dominant in the early time stage . after this",
    "damping the collisional damping may play a role in the time - evolution process . in future",
    "we would like to introduce this collisional process in our simulation .",
