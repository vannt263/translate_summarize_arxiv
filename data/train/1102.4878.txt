    "many real networks , such as the www , the internet , social and biological networks , have complex connectivity . a property shared by many types of networks",
    "is the scale - free ( sf ) degree distribution @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is degree ( number of links connected to a node ) and @xmath2 is the fraction of nodes with degree @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "functions of networks crucially depend on the degree distribution and other structural properties of networks  @xcite .",
    "an important property of networks is robustness against the removal of nodes caused by failures or intentional attacks .",
    "et al_. studied the robustness of networks against two types of attacks : random failure , where nodes are sequentially removed with equal probability , and intentional attack , where hubs ( i.e. , nodes with large degrees ) are preferentially removed  @xcite .",
    "they showed that sf networks having @xmath3 are highly robust against the random failure in the sense that almost all nodes have to be removed to disintegrate a sf network .",
    "however , sf networks are fragile to the intentional attack in the sense that the network is destroyed if a small fraction of hubs are removed .",
    "these results have been analytically established  @xcite .",
    "the robustness of networks against other percolation - like processes such as the betweenness - based attack  @xcite and degree - weighted attacks  @xcite have also been studied .",
    "in fact , attacks to networks may occur as propagating processes .",
    "examples include computer viruses  @xcite .",
    "the ( first ) critical infection rate above which a global outbreak occurs has been obtained for propagating processes such as the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) and susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) models . in particular , for sf networks with @xmath3 , any positive infection rate induces a global outbreak  @xcite ( also see a recent paper  @xcite in which it is shown that the critical infection rate of the sis model on sf networks vanishes regardless of the value of @xmath4 ) . another ( second ) critical infection rate , above which the network remaining after all the infected nodes are deleted ( we call it residual network ) is disintegrated , also exists and is larger than the first critical infection rate .",
    "the residual network is important because a second epidemic spread may occur on it  @xcite . by using the generating functions , newman derived the second critical infection rate for uncorrelated networks to show that the second critical infection rate is positive even for @xmath3  @xcite . in particular , the global outbreak of a second epidemic requires a larger infection rate than that of a first epidemic  @xcite .",
    "defense ( i.e. , immunization ) strategies for networks to contain epidemics are also of practical importance .",
    "epidemics can be efficiently suppressed by various defense strategies such as target immunization  @xcite , acquaintance immunization  @xcite , and graph partitioning immunization  @xcite .",
    "such a defense strategy raises the first critical infection rate .",
    "in contrast , we study the effectiveness of a defense strategy in enhancing the robustness of networks , i.e. , increasing the second critical infection rate . using the generating functions  @xcite , we formulate the effects of defense strategies on the robustness of networks .",
    "we determine the two critical infection rates for the following three combinations of networks and defense strategies : random graph with the random defense , in which nodes are vaccinated in a random order , uncorrelated sf network with the random defense , and uncorrelated sf network with the degree - based defense , in which nodes are vaccinated in the descending order of the degree . when vaccines are inefficient , the random graph is more robust than the sf network in the sense that the second critical infection rate is larger . when vaccines are relatively efficient , the sf network with the degree - based defense is more robust than the other two cases .",
    "we also discuss the optimization of the vaccine allocation under a trade - off between the number and efficiency of vaccines available .",
    "and @xmath5 are the probabilities that an infected ( and eventually removed ) node infects an unvaccinated and vaccinated neighbor in a propagating attack , respectively . ,",
    "width=566 ]    we adopt the sir model , which is a continuous - time markov process on a given static network with @xmath6 nodes , as the propagating attack .",
    "each node takes one of the three states : susceptible , infected , and removed .",
    "all nodes except a randomly selected seed node are initially susceptible .",
    "the seed node is initially infected .",
    "susceptible nodes get infected at a rate proportional to the number of infected neighbors . in other words , if a susceptible node is adjacent to an infected node , the susceptible node gets infected with probability @xmath7 within short time @xmath8 .",
    "an infected node becomes removed at a unit rate , i.e. , with probability @xmath8 within short time @xmath8 , irrespective of the neighbors states .",
    "following the methods employed in previous literature  @xcite , we analyze the bond percolation to estimate the transition points , the final size of global outbreaks , and that of residual networks of the sir model .",
    "we assume that the disease is transmitted from an infected node to a susceptible node with probability @xmath9 , where @xmath10 p(\\tau)\\rmd\\tau$ ] , @xmath11 is the infectious period during which the infected node is infected , and @xmath12 is the distribution of @xmath11  @xcite . in other words , we map the sir dynamics onto the bond percolation with open bond probability @xmath13 . strictly speaking , this mapping is not generally exact  @xcite .",
    "the transition point above which a global outbreak occurs and the mean final size of global outbreaks at a given @xmath13 obtained from the analysis of the bond percolation are precise for the sir model .",
    "however , the bond percolation fails to predict the probability of global outbreaks in the sir model  @xcite .",
