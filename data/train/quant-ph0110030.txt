    "the objectives of quantum control are to find ways to manipulate the time evolution of a quantum system such as to    drive an initial given state to a pre - determined final state , the target state ; or    optimize the expectation value of a target observable .    among a wealth of applications",
    "are those to quantum computing , where it is clearly essential to be able to start off a quantum procedure with a given initial state , and to problems involving the population levels in atomic systems , such as the laser cooling of atomic or molecular systems .",
    "the mathematical tools necessary for the theoretical investigation of these control problems are diverse , involving algebraic , group theoretic and topological methods .    the questions that one may ask include :    when is a given quantum system completely controllable ?",
    "if a system is not completely controllable , how does this affect optimization of a given operator ?",
    "how near can you get to a target state for a not completely controllable system ?",
    "the answer to the first question depends on a knowledge of the lie algebra generated by the system s quantum hamiltonian , that to the second arises from properties of the lie group structure , while the last clearly involves ideas of topology .    especially in the area of lie group theory",
    ", there is a large corpus of classical mathematics which can supply answers to questions arising in quantum control .",
    "in particular , for the type of controllability known as _ pure state controllability _ classical lie group theory has already given the basic results .",
    "the quantum control system we shall consider is typically of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the internal hamiltonian of the unperturbed system and @xmath2 are interaction terms governing the interaction of the system with an external field . the dynamical evolution of the system is governed by the unitary evolution operator @xmath3 , which satisfies the schrodinger equation @xmath4 with initial condition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the identity operator . by use of the magnus expansion , it can be shown that the solution @xmath7 involves all the commutators of the @xmath8 .",
    "the operators @xmath8 , @xmath9 , in ( [ eq : h ] ) are hermitian .",
    "their skew - hermitian counterparts @xmath10 generate a lie algebra @xmath11 known as the dynamical lie algebra of the control system which is always a subalgebra of @xmath12 , or for trace - zero hamiltonians , @xmath13 .",
    "the degree of controllability is determined by the dynamical lie algebra generated by the control system hamiltonian @xmath14 . if @xmath15 then _ all _",
    "the unitary operators are generated and we call such a system _ completely controllable_. a large variety of common quantum systems can be shown to be completely controllable @xcite .",
    "the interesting cases arise when @xmath11 is a proper subalgebra of @xmath12 .",
    "such systems may still exhibit _ pure state controllability _ , in that starting with any initial pure state any target pure state may be obtained , as distinct from the completely controllable case , when all ( kinematically admissible ) states  pure or mixed  may be achieved .",
    "we shall restrict our attention here to finite - level quantum systems with @xmath16 discrete energy levels .",
    "the pure quantum states of the system are represented by normalized wavefunctions @xmath17 , which form a hilbert space @xmath18 .",
    "however , the state of a quantum system need not be represented by a pure state @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , we may consider a system consisting of a large number of identical , non - interacting particles , which can be in different internal quantum states , i.e. , a certain fraction @xmath20 of the particles may be in quantum state @xmath21 , another fraction @xmath22 may be in another state @xmath23 and so forth .",
    "hence , the state of the system as a whole is described by a discrete ensemble of quantum states @xmath24 with non - negative weights @xmath25 that sum up to one .",
    "such an ensemble of quantum states is called a _ mixed - state _ , and it can be represented by a density operator @xmath26 on @xmath18 with the spectral representation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an orthonormal set of vectors in @xmath18 that forms an ensemble of independent pure quantum states .",
    "the evolution of @xmath29 is governed by @xmath30 with @xmath31 as above .",
    "clearly if _ all _ the unitary operators can be generated we have the optimal situation , complete controllability .",
    "however , classical lie group theory tells us that even when we only obtain a subalgebra of @xmath12 we can obtain pure state controllability .",
    "the results arise from consideration@xcite of the transitive action of lie groups on the sphere @xmath32 .",
    "the classical `` orthogonal '' groups @xmath33 where the field @xmath34 is either the reals @xmath35 , the complexes @xmath36 or the quaternions @xmath37 , are defined to be those that keep invariant the length of the vector @xmath38 ; the squared length is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 refers to the appropriate conjugation .",
    "these compact groups are , essentially , the only ones which give transitive actions on the appropriate spheres , as follows :    @xmath41 transitive on @xmath42    @xmath43 transitive on @xmath44    @xmath45 transitive on @xmath46 .",
    "since we may regard our pure state as a normalized vector in @xmath47 and thus as a point on @xmath48 , we obtain pure state controllability only for @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 if we are not too fussy about phases ) and @xmath51 , the latter for even @xmath16 only .",
    "( note that we can not get @xmath52 as a subalgebra of @xmath49 . )",
    "complete controllability is clearly a stronger condition than pure state controllability . to illustrate our theme of the limitations on quantum control , we now give two examples based on a truncated oscillator with nearest - level interactions for which the algebras generated are @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "both these examples are generic .",
    "consider a three - level system with energy levels @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and assume the interaction with an external field @xmath58 is of dipole form with nearest neighbor interactions only .",
    "then we have @xmath59 , where the matrix representations of @xmath1 and @xmath60 are @xmath61 ,    \\quad   { h}_1 =   \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } 0 & d_1 & 0 \\\\ d_1 & 0 & d_2 \\\\ 0 & d_2 & 0 \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] if the energy levels are equally spaced , i.e. , @xmath62 and the transition dipole moments are equal , i.e. , @xmath63 then we have @xmath64 ,    \\quad     { h}_1 = d    \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the traceless part of @xmath1 .",
    "both @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 where @xmath69\\ ] ] which is a defining relation for @xmath70 .",
    "the dynamical lie algebra in this case is in fact @xmath70 .",
    "it is easy to show that the matrix @xmath71 is a real anti - symmetric representation of @xmath70 if @xmath72 .",
    "explicitly , a suitable unitary matrix is given by @xmath73.\\ ] ] since the dynamical algebra and group in the basis determined by @xmath7 consists of _ real _ matrices , real states can only be transformed to real states ; this means that for any initial state there is a large class of unreachable states .",
    "this example is generic as it applies to @xmath16-level systems , although for even @xmath16 we need other than dipole interactions to generate @xmath53 .",
    "the analogous dipole interaction generates @xmath54 in the even @xmath16 case , as we now illustrate .",
    "consider a four - level system with hamiltonian @xmath59 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 note that @xmath76 and @xmath77 satisfy @xmath78 for @xmath79 where @xmath80 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath81 which is a defining relation for @xmath54 .",
    "consider an initial state of the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 satisfies ( [ eq : sp ] ) , it can only evolve into states @xmath84 where @xmath85 satisfies ( [ eq : sp ] ) , under the action of a unitary evolution operator in exponential image of @xmath11 .",
    "hence , any target state that is not of the form ( [ eq : rho_1 ] ) is not accessible from the initial state ( [ eq : rho_0 ] ) .",
    "note that the initial state @xmath86 is of the form @xmath87 and that @xmath88 satisfies ( [ eq : sp ] ) . consider the target state @xmath89 which is clearly kinematically admissible since @xmath90 but note that @xmath91 and @xmath92 does not satisfy ( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath93 is not dynamically accessible from @xmath94 for this system .    given a target state @xmath93 that is not dynamically accessible from an initial state @xmath94 , we can easily construct observables whose kinematical upper bound for its expectation value can not be reached dynamically .",
    "simply consider @xmath95 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath96 assumes its kinematical maximum only when the system is in state @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath93 is not reachable , the kinematical upper bound is not dynamically realizable .",
    "in this short introduction to quantum control theory , we have described the goals of the subject briefly , and then illustrated the limitations by generic examples where complete control is not possible .",
    "the tools we have used are , in the main , those of classical lie group theory .",
    "theoretical problems that remain to be tackled include to what extent these non - controllable systems can , in fact , be controlled ; and , of course , the paramount problem of implementing these controls in practice .",
