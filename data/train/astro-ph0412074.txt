    "many of the main properties of blazars can be explained by relativistic jets ( see review by urry & padovani 1995 ) ; however , jet formation remains one of the unsolved fundamental problems in astrophysics ( e.g. , meier , koide , & uchida 2001 ) .",
    "three scenarios have been suggested for the origin of jets : ( 1 ) from the vicinity of the black hole ( bh ) event horizon via extraction of the spin energy of the bh ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) ; ( 2 ) from a wind from a magnetized accretion disk ( blandford & payne 1982 ) ; and ( 3 ) from an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 ) , either dominated by outflows ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) or a jet ( falcke , krding , & markoff 2003 ) .",
    "though there are still some unresolved issues with each of these models , it is clear that an accretion disk is involved in all of them .",
    "it is expected that there is a connection between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk .",
    "the jet - disk connection has been extensively explored by many authors and in different ways . since emission from the relativistic jets",
    "is highly beamed , one needs to use isotropic radiation to investigate the connection . on large scales ( @xmath0kpc  mpc ) , many authors have tested the correlation between different emission - line luminosity and radio luminosity ( stockton & mackenty 1987 ; baum & heckman 1989 ; rawlings & saunders 1991 ; falcke , malkan , & biermann 1995 ; xu , livio , & baum 1999 ; cao & jiang 2001 ; wang , ho , & staubert 2003 ) .",
    "indeed , a strong link between the jet and the disk has been found , although we should note that it is indirect because the extended radio emission and the line emission have quite different lifetimes . on @xmath0pc scales ,",
    "radio data from very long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) have been used to calculate the kinetic luminosity to test the jet - disk connection ( celotti , padovani , & ghisellini 1997 ; hereafter cpg ) .",
    "cpg found no correlation between the broad - line region ( blr ) luminosity ( @xmath1 ) and the kinetic luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , although there are some suggestive hints of a jet - disk connection .",
    "maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 ; hereafter mt03 ; see also maraschi 2001 ) investigated the problem using a sample of blazars for which the jet power could be estimated from modeling of their spectral energy distribution .",
    "they found that the jet power is linearly proportional to the disk power , with flat - spectrum radio quasars radiating at a greater efficiency than bl lac objects . in view of the importance of this issue , it certainly merits reexamination .",
    "jet formation may depend on the state of the accretion disk .",
    "marscher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the radio galaxy 3c 120 , as in microquasars , ejected superluminous radio blobs following a dip in the x - ray emission .",
    "it is essential to probe the accretion rates of the disks to test the jet - disk connection .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ) showed that most bl lac objects have optically thin adafs , while most radio - loud quasars have standard accretion disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that the degree of radio - loudness in low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is determined by the eddington ratio ( ho 2002 ) , and bh accreting systems obey a `` fundamental plane '' defined by their radio emission , hard x - ray emission , and bh mass ( merloni , heinz , & di matteo 2003 ) .",
    "the highly anisotropic emission from the jet depends on the dissipation of the jet kinetic energy , and the radiation efficiency may be controlled by both the state of the central engine and the environment of the jet ( celotti & fabian 1993 ; wang , staubert , & ho 2002 ) .",
    "however , how the kinetic luminosity , a more fundamental parameter of the relativistic jet , depends on the properties of the accretion disk is not yet known .    in this paper",
    ", we tackle this issue with the sample of blazars from cpg .",
    "we show that in blazars there is a well - defined correlation between kinetic luminosity , blr luminosity , which we use as a surrogate to represent the bolometric luminosity of the accretion disk , and the bh mass .",
    "moreover , the degree of jet - dominance diminishes with increasing eddington ratio .",
    "table 1 : the sample@xmath3    0.1 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,^,^,<,<,>,<,^ , < \" , ]     -0.5 cm",
    "for the purposes of the present paper , we need the kinetic luminosity , bolometric luminosity , and the bh mass .",
    "according to cpg , the kinetic luminosity is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the size of the radio jet , @xmath6 is the jet velocity in units of the light speed ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the number density of relativistic electrons , @xmath9 is the lorentz factor of the jet , and @xmath10 is the electron mass .",
    "@xmath5 is an observable parameter , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be obtained by fitting the observed spectrum .",
    "however , the largest source of uncertainty for the kinetic luminosity lies in the factor @xmath11 , which describes the particle composition of the jet . for a jet composed of a proton - electron plasma",
    ", @xmath11 has a value of @xmath12 , while for a pair plasma @xmath13 . as in cpg , we take @xmath14 . in the present paper ,",
    "we use a subset of the sample of cpg , which provides @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our subset is limited by the availability of the following data : ( 1 ) @xmath2 , ( 2 ) bh mass estimate , and ( 3 ) flux for the h@xmath6 @xmath154861 or   @xmath152800 line , which , as described below , we use to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "we omit those sources with an upper limit on @xmath2 because they only have an upper limit on @xmath5 .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) give the doppler factors of the sample , estimated from the classical limits of synchrotron self - compton emission . in this study",
    ", we estimate bh masses using one of three methods , depending on the availability of the necessary data : ( 1 ) the relation between stellar velocity dispersion and bh mass , as fitted by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; ( 2 ) the linewidth - luminosity - mass scaling relation , which is calibrated against local agns studied using reverberation mapping ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) ; and ( 3 ) the correlation between host galaxy luminosity and bh mass , as given by mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) .",
    "when the linewidth ( fwhm ) of h@xmath6 is not available , we use the fwhm of or as suggested by vestergaard ( 2002 ) and mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) , respectively , to estimate the bh mass .",
    "our paper analyzes 35 blazars ( table 1 ) from the sample of cpg .",
    "when the bh mass is estimated from the linewidth - luminosity - mass relation , we use an extrapolation of the continuum from the magnitudes given in vron - cetty & vron ( 2003 ) , assuming a spectrum of the form @xmath16 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the uncertainty in the @xmath17 relation is small , @xmath18 dex ( tremaine et al . 2002 ) . on the other hand , the uncertainty on the zeropoint of",
    "the linewidth - luminosity - mass relation is approximately 0.5 dex ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese et al .",
    "we note , however , that this method may systematically overestimate the bh masses in radio - loud quasars if the optical - ultraviolet continuum in these objects is significantly beamed .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of this effect , since the amount of beaming is wavelength dependent ( e.g. , bregman 1990 ) , and we have no good constraints for the optical - ultraviolet region . according to mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) , the @xmath19 correlation for quasar host galaxies",
    "has an uncertainty of 0.6 dex . given the intrinsic uncertainty of the different bh mass estimators and the heterogeneity of our sample , we estimate that the individual bh masses may have an uncertainty as large as @xmath01 dex .",
    "the blr luminosities given in cpg were derived by scaling several strong emission lines to the quasar template spectrum of francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , using ly@xmath20 as a reference . with this approach ,",
    "cpg find no significant correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we note , however , that some of the key emission lines used in their method have a very large scatter in their ratio with respect to ly@xmath20 .",
    "for example , c iv @xmath151550/ly@xmath20 = @xmath21 and @xmath152800/ly@xmath20 = @xmath22 .",
    "the variation in the strength of c iv and relative to ly@xmath20 stems from genuine object - to - object variations in the detailed physical conditions of the blr in quasars .",
    "since this scatter propagates directly into an error in @xmath1 , it is possible that this is responsible for the apparent lack of a correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio h@xmath6/ly@xmath20 is largely governed by recombination physics ( netzer 1990 ) and hence is much better defined .",
    "francis et al . ( 1991 ) find h@xmath6/ly@xmath20 = @xmath23 . here",
    ", we will adopt h@xmath6 _",
    "alone _ as the fiducial line to estimate @xmath1 ; when h@xmath6 is not available , we use , which has the second smallest scatter relative to ly@xmath20 . following the notation of cpg ( their eq .",
    "1 ) , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . table 1 gives the values of @xmath1 estimated from equation 1 .",
    "figure 1_a _  shows a strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have tested the partial correlation among @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath28 , the luminosity distances of the objects , so as to avoid the possible spurious effects caused by their common dependence on the luminosity distance . using the least square method of multivariate regression , we find that @xmath29 , with partial coefficient @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this test shows that the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is intrinsic rather than introduced by the dependence of @xmath28 .",
    "since we are exploring the possible dependence of jets on the accretion disks ( using @xmath1 as a substitute for the disk bolometric luminosity ) , @xmath1 should be treated as the independent variable .",
    "the least square method gives the following regression fit in figure 1_a _  ( excluding the prominent outlier 3c 345 ) : @xmath32 with pearson s coefficient @xmath33 and a probability of @xmath34 for rejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation .",
    "assuming that the blr luminosity is due to the reprocessing of the primary continuum radiation from the accretion disk , equation 2 can be interpreted as evidence for a strong connection between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk .",
    "the relation @xmath35 is much flatter than the linear relation between jet power and disk power found by mt03 .",
    "it is unclear what the source of discrepancy is .",
    "we simply note that our procedure for estimating disk luminosities differs from that of mt03 .",
    "mt03 obtain their disk luminosities either directly from the optical - uv luminosity of the big blue bump or from the original prescription of cpg .    despite the strong correlation exhibited in figure 1_a _ , clearly there is still significant scatter .",
    "the scatter around the best - fit line is @xmath36 dex .",
    "although a significant fraction of this scatter may be due to measurement and/or systematic errors in @xmath2 and @xmath1 , it is possible that it indicates that a second parameter is important .",
    "a nature choice to investigate is the bh mass , here cast in terms of its eddington luminosity , @xmath37 . using the least square method of multivariate regression , we indeed find that @xmath2 correlates with _ both _ @xmath1 and @xmath37 . excluding 3c 345 and 0235 + 164 ( its bh mass is an upper limit ) , we obtain @xmath38 with pearson s coefficient @xmath39 . the new correlation ( fig .",
    "1_b _ ) shows a smaller scatter , which has reduced to @xmath40 dex .",
    "the signifcance of adding the eddington luminosity as a new parameter in the correlation ( 3 ) can be tested by the @xmath41-test defined by bevington ( 1969 ) .",
    "we find @xmath42 and probability @xmath43 .",
    "the improvement in the correlation by including @xmath37 as an additional variable suggests that the jet power depends on both the disk luminosity ( or accretion rate ) _ and _  bh mass . whether additional variables are required , however , can not be decided on the basis of the data presented here .",
    "the scatter in figure 1_b _ , though reduced , remains substantial , but the significant uncertainties currently associated with the observables prevent us from assessing how much of the scatter is intrinsic .",
    "equation 3 can be casted in a different form . defining the `` jet - dominance '' factor as @xmath44 , the eddington ratio as @xmath45 , and assuming @xmath46 ( netzer 1990 )",
    ", it follows that @xmath47 this implies that the relative importance of the jet power compared to the disk luminosity is mainly controlled by , and is inversely dependent on , the eddington ratio .",
    "mt03 reached a qualitatively similar conclusion in their analysis .",
    "this relation provides a physical basis for understanding the spectral sequence of blazars ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ; wang et al . 2002 , 2004 ; mt03 ) .",
    "this empirical relation may also help guide theoretical models on jet formation .",
    "using rough estimates of the bh masses and bolometric luminosities for a sample of 35 blazars with vlbi observations , we find that the kinetic power of the relativistic jet in these objects is strongly coupled both to the accretion disk luminosity and the bh mass .",
    "equivalently , the degree of jet dominance , defined as the ratio of the jet kinetic power to the bolometric luminosity of the disk , is largely controlled by and is inversely correlated with the eddington ratio of the accretion disk",
    ". this empirical relation should provide strong constraints on theoretical models for jet formation and jet - disk coupling .",
    "there is growing evidence in recent years that bh accretion in agns provides an important source of energy feedback to their host galaxies and their large - scale environments ( see review by begelman 2004 ) .",
    "relativistic jets from radio - loud sources , in particular , may be particularly effective in heating the intracluster medium in galaxy clusters .",
    "the empirical correlations described in this study , if they can be properly calibrated , opens up the possibility of using them as tools to investigate quantitatively accretion - powered feedback in the context of galaxy formation .",
