    "precise measurements of particles properties require that the corresponding theoretical calculations have to include up to ( at least ) two - loop radiative corrections . in this paper",
    "we investigate a fast and flexible numerical method for their accurate evaluation .",
    "a commonly used procedure in modern radiative correction calculations is to express the result as a combination of a limited number of master integrals ( mi s ) , using the integration by parts identities @xcite . in this framework , it is necessary to obtain a precise determination of the mi s , even if the analytical values can not be obtained due to the large number of different scales occurring in each of the mi s ( internal masses and external momenta or mandelstam variables ) , as it happens in electroweak theory .",
    "the general massive 2-loop self - mass diagram has four mi s related to the sunrise ( 3-denominator ) diagram , only one independent mi related to the 4-denominator diagram , and again only one new mi related to the 5-denominator diagram @xcite .",
    "several procedures for a precise numerical evaluation of the mi s have been and still are investigated , such as multiple expansions @xcite , numerical integration @xcite , or difference equations @xcite .    another method based on differential equations @xcite",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where it was shown how to use runge - kutta method @xcite to solve numerically the system of linear differential equations in the external invariant @xmath0 satisfied by sunrise master integrals .",
    "the method was extended to 2-loop 4-denominator and 5-denominator cases in @xcite , where it was also suggested how to evaluate numerically the mi s nearby thresholds and pseudo - thresholds .",
    "we give in this paper an accurate implementation of that approach for the sunrise and the 4-denominator mi s .    in section 2 ,",
    "the @xmath2 expansions of the mi s are constructed , in section 3 initial conditions for the differential equations for the master integrals ( or master differential equations , mde s ) are discussed .",
    "some results of the program , showing characteristic behaviour of the studied mi s are presented in section 4 . in section 5 , a method for the numerical evaluation of the mi s near thresholds and pseudo - thresholds is discussed in detail , while section 6 is devoted to comparisons with existing results .    finally , in section 7 , our conclusions on the application of the method to present and further work are presented .",
