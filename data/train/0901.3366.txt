    "the ground state magnetic dipole moment has sensitivity to the orbital and spin components of the state wavefunction , and hence serves as an important observable in the study of nuclear structure .",
    "in particular , the simultaneous consideration of the magnetic dipole moments of mirror nuclei can provide a framework to test present day nuclear structure models .",
    "+ sugimoto @xcite showed that if isospin is a good quantum number , the nuclear magnetic dipole moment could be decomposed into isoscalar and isovector components    @xmath3    where the sum of the isoscalar @xmath4 and isovector @xmath5 moments are taken over all nucleons and @xmath6 denotes the expectation value of @xmath7 for the state @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the magnetic quantum number and nuclear spin , respectively .",
    "the isoscalar magnetic moment represents the sum of the magnetic moments of the mirror partners    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the total isospin and @xmath13 . the left - hand side of eq",
    ".  [ eq2 ] can also be expressed in terms of the isoscalar spin expectation value @xmath0    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    and the constant 0.38 is the sum of the magnetic moments of the bare proton and neutron .",
    "the extreme single - particle limit gives @xmath16 for odd-@xmath17 mirror partners whose odd nucleon occupies a single - particle orbital with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the value @xmath20 $ ] results for the cases when the odd nucleon resides in an orbital with @xmath21 . experimentally deduced @xmath0 values generally fall within single - particle expectations , except for a few instances that are discussed in detail later .",
    "buck and perez @xcite analyzed the magnetic moments of mirror nuclei in a different approach .",
    "they showed that a plot of the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath22 , of the odd proton member of the mirror pair @xmath1 as a function of the gyromagnetic ratio of the odd neutron member @xmath2 resulted in a straight line .",
    "further scrutiny of this linear dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath24 , provided simple expressions for the slope @xmath25 and intercept @xmath26 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the spin and orbital contributions to the @xmath30-factor , respectively , with @xmath31 for protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "the extreme single - particle model gives @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while the most recent evaluation of mirror magnetic moments for @xmath34 nuclei by buck , merchant , and perez @xcite produced @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the small deviation of the experimental moments from the extreme single particle expectation was taken to possibly reflect meson exchange currents and/or small contributions to @xmath37 from the even nucleon @xcite .",
    "ground state magnetic moment measurements of the neutron - deficient nuclei @xmath38c @xcite , @xmath39cl @xcite , @xmath40k @xcite , and @xmath41cu @xcite have been completed at nscl .",
    "the results for the odd-@xmath17 nuclei @xmath40k ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath41cu @xmath43 have significantly extended the evaluation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 vs.   @xmath2 to heavier masses . in this paper , the experimental approach to magnetic moment measurements at nscl is described , followed by a summary discussion of the new magnetic moment values for @xmath40k and @xmath41cu and the resulting systematic trends of mirror moments at higher mass numbers .",
    "ground state magnetic moments are measured at nscl using the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance on @xmath26-emitting nuclei ( @xmath26-nmr ) .",
    "nuclei of interest are produced by bombarding a fixed target with intermediate energy projectiles from the nscl coupled cyclotrons .",
    "the incoming beam is made incident on the target at a small angle relative to the normal beam direction to break the reaction plane symmetry and produce a spin - polarized secondary beam of high - velocity ions .",
    "the ion species are mass separated in the a1900 fragment separator @xcite , with the separator tuned to maximize both the purity and transmission of the desired radioactive isotope .",
    "an adjustable slit system located at the a1900 intermediate image is used to select a portion of the momentum distribution of the desired isotopes , which is then transmitted to the @xmath26-nmr endstation .",
    "the production of spin polarized nuclei in intermediate - energy heavy - ion reactions was first demonstrated by asahi _",
    "@xcite , and has been used extensively to measure ground state nuclear moments of short - lived isotopes at riken , ganil , gsi , and msu .",
    "a classical treatment of the mechanism to describe the nuclear polarization in such reactions @xcite considered conservation of linear and angular momentum .",
    "the treatment was extended by okuno _",
    "@xcite to account for varying initial reaction conditions .",
    "although good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements was achieved , the magnitude of the observed polarization was typically a factor of three smaller than predictions .",
    "the extension of ground state magnetic moments of mirror nuclei to heavier masses at nscl was enabled by the establishment of spin polarization in intermediate - energy heavy - ion reactions where a single nucleon is picked up from the target by the fast - moving projectile . the initial measurements of groh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that large , positive spin polarization is obtained near the peak of the momentum distribution for proton pickup reactions .",
    "subsequent systematic measurements by turzo _",
    "@xcite at ganil demonstrated the method for neutron pickup as well .    a more accurate prediction of the spin polarization realized in intermediate - energy heavy - ion reactions ,",
    "both for nucleon removal and pickup , has been developed @xcite .",
    "starting with the classical kinematic picture discussed above , a monte carlo simulation that included the addition of a more realistic angular distribution of the outgoing fragments , deorientation caused by @xmath37-ray emission , and corrections for the out - of - reaction plane acceptance , was shown to reproduce , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the polarization observed in intermediate - energy reactions .",
    "the development of an accurate simulation of the spin polarization process significantly aided the execution of the magnetic moment measurements of @xmath40k and @xmath41cu described below .",
    "the @xmath26-nmr system at nscl consists of a small electromagnet , @xmath26 detectors , and a radiofrequency ( rf ) system @xcite .",
    "the room temperature electromagnet has a pole gap of 10  cm and operates at a maximum field of 0.5  t. the @xmath26 detectors consist of two plastic @xmath44 telescopes placed around the sample holder in `` up '' and `` down '' positions relative to the orientation of the magnetic field of the electromagnet .",
    "the thin telescope element is 0.3-cm thick bc400 plastic scintillator of dimensional area 4.4 @xmath45 4.4  cm , while the thick telescope element is also bc400 scintillator with thickness 2.5  cm and area 5.1 @xmath45 5.1  cm .",
    "the scintillators are mounted on bc800 plastic light guides that allow placement of the 12-stage photomultiplier tubes outside the fringing field of the electromagnet .",
    "a vacuum chamber can be placed in the pole gap of the electromagnet between the two @xmath26 detector telescopes .",
    "the part of the vacuum chamber above and below the sample holder has been removed and replaced with thin plastic to reduce the attenuation of @xmath26 particles .",
    "the downstream plate of the vacuum chamber is used to mount the sample holder , rf coils , a beam collimator , and a solid - state si detector for monitoring the secondary beam .",
    "the rf system at nscl was recently upgraded to allow the simultaneous application of multiple frequencies to the sample without significant loss of power @xcite .",
    "the frequency - modulated signal from one of up to six frequency generators can be selected by a double - balanced mixer , amplified to a maximum 250 w , and delivered to a high - power rf box containing a bank of vacuum variable capacitors and an impedance matching element ( either a 50 @xmath46 resistor or multi - turn transformer ) .",
    "these two elements , along with the rf coil surrounding the sample holder , make up an @xmath47 resonance circuit with a resonance @xmath48 factor of @xmath49 .",
    "tuning of the @xmath47 for a given frequency is accomplished by setting the variable capacitors via remote controlled stepper motor units .",
    "any combination of capacitors can be selected by way of fast switching relays . the time sequence for applying each frequency and the corresponding capacitance , as well as any necessary secondary beam pulsing , is controlled by a pulse pattern generator .",
    "the proton separation energy of @xmath40k is only 80  kev based on the 2003 atomic mass evaluation @xcite , and its vicinity to the proton drip line may reveal new and interesting nuclear structure features that may be reflected in the ground state magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the @xmath40k ions were produced starting with a primary beam of @xmath50ar at 150  mev / nucleon via a single proton pickup from a be target followed by two neutron removal .",
    "the @xmath40k production rate was @xmath51  pps / pna of primary beam .",
    "the nmr was scanned between 520 and 620  khz based on a previous measurement @xcite .",
    "a resonance signal was observed at frequency @xmath52  khz , corresponding to a magnetic moment @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the systematic variation of the ground state magnetic moments of the odd-@xmath17 cu isotopes , where neutrons are filling the @xmath54 shell , are quenched relative to shell model expectations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the level structure @xcite and transition probabilities @xcite give a disparate picture of the robustness of the @xmath55ni double shell closure .",
    "the magnetic moment of the one - proton particle nucleus @xmath41cu is expected to be @xmath56 based on shell models calculations completed in the full @xmath54 shell @xcite .",
    "@xmath41cu ions were produced by impinging a @xmath57ni primary beam of energy 140 mev / nucleon on a be target .",
    "the single - proton pickup reaction and subsequent two neutron removal resulted in a @xmath41cu production rate of @xmath58 pps / pna of primary beam .",
    "a broad nmr scan was completed between 1400 and 2800  khz , and a resonance signal was observed at @xmath59  khz .",
    "the deduced magnetic moment value @xmath60 @xcite was nearly 20% smaller than shell model expectations .",
    "the new ground state magnetic moments of @xmath40k and @xmath41cu dramatically extend the mass range of known mirror partners for @xmath34 and @xmath42 systems . the systematic trend in @xmath0 for odd-@xmath17 mirror nuclei",

    "@xcite with the exception of @xmath40k and @xmath41cu discussed here and @xmath61al @xcite and @xmath62ni @xcite , for which signs of @xmath7 are taken from theoretical predictions .",
    "nearly all @xmath0 values are bounded by the extreme single - particle limits , including the new value @xmath63 deduced for the @xmath64 mirror partners , which includes @xmath40k and @xmath40s .",
    "it was surprising that the @xmath65 system followed the trends established by more well - bounded nuclei , given that @xmath40k exhibits such a small proton binding energy .",
    "the two mirror systems whose @xmath0 value lies outside the extreme single - particle expectation are those with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the former disparity has been linked to possible proton intruder configurations in the ground state wavefunction of @xmath38c @xcite .",
    "the later has been attributed to a breaking of the @xmath55ni double - magic core @xcite .",
    "while the linear behavior of @xmath23 vs.  @xmath24 was demonstrated for @xmath34 nuclei , no such analysis had been performed for @xmath42 nuclei due to the limited experimental data for magnetic moments of @xmath68 nuclei near the proton drip line .",
    "there are now five @xmath42 mirror pairs whose ground state magnetic moments are known , including the @xmath69 system discussed here .",

    "@xcite for the @xmath34 mirror pairs .",
    "recently , perez _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended the treatment of the linear behavior of mirror magnetic moments by using shell model estimates to make small modifications to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the inclusion of contributions of total spin and angular momentum from both odd and even nucleon types improved the fit to the linear correlations between gryomagnetic ratios of mirror partners , and demonstrated the consistent treatment of @xmath1 vs.  @xmath2 for both @xmath34 and @xmath42 mirror pairs .",
    "we note that the two mirror systems at @xmath72 and @xmath67 that show anomalous behavior in @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] follow the linear correlation in @xmath1 vs.  @xmath2 demonstrated for other known mirror partners .",
    "the slope @xmath25 in the buck - perez relation represents a ratio of the neutron and proton spin and orbital @xmath30-factors , effectively canceling any systematic spin dependence from the mirror partners , as opposed to relation for @xmath0 , which will amplify such spin effects . the underlying case for the disparate behavior of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 mirror moments may lie in the spin contribution from low-@xmath19 proton orbitals that comprise some part of the ground state wavefunction of the @xmath74 nucleus",
    "we plan to continue our efforts to extend the measurements of known ground state magnetic moments to heavier nuclei . to this end",
