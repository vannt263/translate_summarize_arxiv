    "in this paper we introduce an eikonal monte carlo model which simulates hadron - hadron collisions in which a `` hard '' parton - parton scattering has occurred . in hard events , described by perturbative qcd , the outgoing particles with large transverse momentum form jets",
    ". these are clusters of outgoing hadrons produced approximately in the direction of the two outgoing partons of the hard parton - parton scattering .",
    "jet physics plays an essential role as a test of perturbative qcd and in determining the parameters of the standard model .",
    "it will be important for future detection of new particles and might help shed light on the nature the pomeron .",
    "if we are to find some new physics at future ( or current colliders ) or test the known physics ( such as perturbative qcd ) , we will need to give an accurate description of the already known physical process which would then be considered as a background to the new physics .    the underlying event , in hard interactions , is defined to be all the additional interactions that are not part of the hard scattering .",
    "thus the underlying event may contain particles from proton - antiproton , remnant - remnant interactions and hard multiparton interactions , if such interactions do occur .    at present , our understanding of underlying event physics is not sufficient to match the precision of experimental measurements , so to fully exploit current and future data we need to improve that understanding .    to this end",
    "the cdf collaboration recently measured the activity of the underlying event in proton - antiproton hard scattering @xcite .",
    "they found that its activity is considerably larger than in soft collisions and that none of the qcd monte - carlo models describe correctly all the properties of the underlying event ( however the best results were obtained with pythia @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to introduce a simple eikonal monte carlo model , with a small number of parameters , and compare it to the measured data from the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "in sec.2 and sec.3 we present the overall theoretical framework of the model and give a description of the hard part , in sec.4 we present our assumptions behind the soft subprocess and its implementation within the herwig monte carlo package and in sec.5 we compare our theoretical results with those from the cdf experiment @xcite and two other underlying event models , the herwig underlying event model @xcite and the hard multiparton model @xcite .",
    "in this section we will review some well known expressions for cross sections within the eikonal approximation , which we will use as the basic framework for our model .",
    "for two incoming particles @xmath6 and two outgoing particles @xmath7 we write their four - momenta as @xmath8 and define the invariant mandelstam variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 as :    @xmath11    the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath12 to the total cross section @xmath13 through a unitarity relation @xcite :    @xmath14    neglecting effects that depend on the spin of the scattering particles we can express the scattering amplitude as the fourier transform of the elastic scattering amplitude in impact parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the impact parameter and @xmath17 being the transverse component of momentum transfer in the cms ) as :    @xmath18    using the optical theorem ( 2 ) we can express the cross sections as : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 we express the elastic amplitude in terms of the eikonal function , @xmath22 , as @xcite : @xmath23 with the eikonal expression ( 7 ) we can write the cross sections as : @xmath24,\\ ] ] @xmath25 \\right |^{2},\\ ] ] @xmath26.\\ ] ] we choose the total cross section in ( 8) as the main parameter of our model . in the next section we will specify the expression for @xmath27 .",
    "in the following section , we will give an expression for the eikonal @xmath27 in ( 8) and provide some justification for its expression .",
    "we start by assuming that at high center of mass energy ( @xmath0 @xmath28 100 gev ) , the main hard scattering is accompanied by semihard interactions , which arise as a result of hard multiple parton scattering in which each parton carries a very small fraction of its parent hadron s momentum .",
    "multiparton interactions lead to the appearance of minijets , i.e. jets with transverse energy much smaller than the total energy ( @xmath0 ) available in the hadron - hadron collision .",
    "multiparton interactions will then drive the rise of the inclusive jet cross section at high energies depending on the small-@xmath29 behaviour of the parton distribution or , to a good approximation , that of the dominant gluon distribution .",
    "in refs.[@xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] it was shown that the average number of secondary hard scatters in an event can be deduced from the qcd improved parton model . for our hard multiple - interactions",
    "we follow the model presented in @xcite where the average number of secondary hard scatters @xmath30 is given by : @xmath31 where the profile function @xmath32 specifies the overlap of partons in the two hadrons in impact parameter .",
    "it can be written as a convolution of form factor distributions of two incoming hadrons , @xmath33 for which we take @xmath34 with @xmath35 gev@xmath4 . the integral then yields @xcite : @xmath36 with @xmath37 the modified bessel function .",
    "the overlap function @xmath32 satisfies @xmath38 the cross section appearing in ( 11 ) , @xmath39 , is the inclusive cross section for @xmath40@xmath41 jets with @xmath42@xmath43@xmath44 : @xmath45 it is assumed , ( as in ref.[@xcite,@xcite ] ) that secondary hard scatters are independent of each other so that the probability for the number of hard scatters @xmath46 , in a @xmath47 collision at a given value of impact parameter , is given by the poissonian probability distribution , @xmath48 the inelastic hard cross section for @xmath49@xmath41partons with @xmath42@xmath43@xmath44 can be written as : @xmath50 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hard multiparton part @xcite of the model was already implemented as part of the herwig monte carlo program @xcite . here",
    "we give a brief summary .",
    "event simulation starts with herwig generating a hard subprocess according to the leading order cross section .",
    "both incoming and outgoing partons involved in the hard subprocess ( at some hard scale @xmath51 ) are evolved ( backward for the incoming parton ) through a coherent parton shower algorithm until they reach a typical hadronic scale , @xmath52 @xmath53 1gev . the coherent parton shower algorithm @xcite resums to all orders both single logarithmic terms associated with the collinear emission ( through implementation of the dglap splitting function ) and single and double logarithmic terms associated with soft emissions .",
    "all the successive partons emitted in the parton shower are colour connected in such a way that partons carrying colour(anticolour ) tend to end up close in momentum and real - space to their anticolour(colour ) partners . once the evolved partons have reached a hadronisation scale @xmath52 , clusters of partons are formed where each colour connected pair of partons forms a single colourless cluster .",
    "each cluster is then decayed into hadrons according to phase space arguments @xcite .",
    "once the main hard subprocess has been simulated , energy - momentum conservation is used to calculate the momentum of the remaining diquark(antidiquark ) or proton(antiproton ) remnant .",
    "each diquark carries opposite colour to that of the parton involved in the hard subrocess .",
    "after the first hard scattering has been completed a number of secondary hard subprocess are simulated where each coloured remnant from the previous interaction is labeled as the new incoming hadron from which the quark valence distribution functions have been removed .",
    "comparing the eikonal expression in ( 10 ) with the cross section in ( 18 ) , we define the hard part of the eikonal as :    @xmath54    the qcd perturbative 2-to-2 parton - parton differential cross section diverges as the transverse momentum of the scattering , @xmath55 , goes to zero .",
    "one must then fix a minimum value @xmath44 for @xmath55 large enough so that the resulting cross section is not larger than the total inelastic non - diffractive cross section and also large enough for perturbative qcd to be reliable .",
    "this dependence of the perturbative qcd differential cross section implies that the eikonalised inelastic hard cross section would also depend on the arbitrary value chosen for the minimum @xmath55 .",
    "our goal is to formulate a model which will be to a certain degree independent of @xmath44 cutoff . to this end , to @xmath57 which describes hard interactions with @xmath42@xmath58@xmath44",
    ", we will add @xmath59 , which will describe interactions with 0 @xmath60 @xmath42@xmath61@xmath44 .",
    "the full eikonal can now be expressed as :    @xmath62    to specify @xmath59 we will use a model introduced by chou and yang @xcite and durand and pi @xcite , which postulates that the elastic scattering is the shadow of the absorption resulting from the passage of one hadronic mass distribution through another .",
    "the transverse distribution of the matter is assumed then to have the same shape as the charge distribution , as measured by the electromagnetic form factor , so that @xmath63 is of the form :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a constant to be determined below and @xmath66 is given in ( 13 ) .",
    "the eikonal now consists of two parts , the hard , @xmath67 and the soft , @xmath68 if we now consider the total cross section ( 8) with @xmath22=@xmath69 and assume @xmath69 to be small , we can expand the exponential in ( 8) . integrating over the impact parameter @xmath70 we get :    @xmath71    following this approximation we will assume that our @xmath72 is a bare non - perturbative cross section for soft proton - antiproton interaction . since @xmath72 , the bare soft cross section in ( 23 ) , is not directly calculable in our model , its value can be determined from the experimental data , i.e. by using the total cross section measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite .    to give a prediction for future lhc data we will rely on the donnachie - landshoff model of the pomeron @xcite which fits successfully all the experimental data on total cross section for proton - proton scattering ,    @xmath73    where @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 gev@xmath77 . assuming @xmath78 = @xmath79 at high energy , the total cross section at the lhc",
    "can then be written as @xmath80    we consider the value of the total cross section as the only phenomenological input to our model ( in addition to those that are already in herwig@xcite and the multiparton hard model @xcite , which we leave at their default values ) .",
    "+ in addition the model contains the following assumptions :    @xmath81 there can be more than one soft interaction in a soft proton - antiproton interaction .",
    "+ @xmath81 the probability distribution for having @xmath82 and only @xmath82 soft scatters in a given proton - antiproton interaction @xmath83 obeys the poissonian distribution ( i.e. multiple soft scatters are uncorrelated ) ,    @xmath84    @xmath81 the hard and soft scatters are assumed to be independent i.e the probability distribution for having @xmath46 hard , and @xmath82 soft , scatters is given by @xmath85 :    @xmath86    we can now express cross sections as :    @xmath87    the inelastic cross section with at least one hard scattering : @xmath88 and the total cross section : @xmath89    the @xmath90 in ( 23 ) is then determined by fixing its value so that the the total cross section ( 31 ) , at some @xmath91 , is equal to the total cross section measured by the cdf collaboration ( @xmath92 = 81.8@xmath932.3 mb ) ( see sec.5 for different values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 used ) .    in order to have a realistic monte carlo event generator we have implemented our eikonal model as part of the herwig monte carlo program @xcite with the full use of its hadronisation model and parton showering properties .",
    "in the following sections we will describe soft processes in detail . the hard processes are as in @xcite ( see sec.3 ) .",
    "before we start with the simulation of an event we need to fix @xmath90 , the bare soft cross section ( as explained in sec.3 ) .",
    "then by drawing from the probability distribution ( 28 ) we decide the number of soft and hard interactions in a given event .",
    "the event simulation can then start with herwig generating a hard subprocess followed by multiparton ones ( see sec.3 ) .",
    "once the multiple hard scatters have been exhausted the soft multiple scatters are generated .      at high @xmath94 ( center of mass energy ) and",
    "low @xmath95 scale of interaction , i.e low-@xmath29 , we might expect a proliferation of soft gluons . in order to simulate each soft subprocess we assume that the bare soft cross section @xmath72 , corresponds to a soft interaction between two incoming soft gluons .",
    "that is , we model the soft inelastic collision between two remnants as a soft elastic collision between two partons within them ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "all soft gluons carry a colour charge and have an effective mass @xmath96 ( inspired by herwig s model of the hadronisation of the outgoing gluons ) .",
    "the two outgoing effective gluons in fig.1 are on mass shell and colour connected to the remnants and to each other , as shown in fig.1 , each gluon colour(anticolour ) is connected to its anticolour(colour ) partner .",
    "because we wanted to keep the implementation of our model as simple as possible we have decided to sever the colour connections between the remnants and the outgoing soft gluons ( see fig.2 , dashed solid lines show severed colour connections ) .",
    "we expect this to be a reasonable approximation since the largest part of the phase space , in the gap between the two remnants , will be filled by final state hadrons produced by the colour field stretched in between the two outgoing soft gluons ( note that in both figs 1 and 2 , two colour lines stretch across the central region ) . in the hadronisation",
    "phase the two outgoing soft gluons form two clusters ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) ( see fig.2 ) which are decayed into final state hadrons ( using herwig s cluster hadronisation model @xcite ) .",
    "following fig.2 , for each soft remnant - remnant interaction we generate two soft effective gluons , on mass shell , with previously tuned masses @xmath96 = 0.75 gev used in the herwig hadronisation model @xcite .",
    "for each soft interaction we will go through the following chain of events ; first the maximum fractional longitudinal momentum allowed for each soft gluon ( @xmath99 ) is determined using the light - cone definition of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath29 of the two remnants , @xmath100 the longitudinal momentum fractions for each soft gluon is then sampled from an @xmath101 = @xmath102 distribution ( which we consider reasonable since we expect the effective gluons to be regge - like ) between some minimum value @xmath103 ( the cutoff ) and the maximum value , @xmath99 , allowed by ( 32 ) .",
    "once their fractional longitudinal momentum has been determined , a transverse momentum for each soft gluon is then sampled from a gaussian distribution for values of @xmath104 , 0@xmath60@xmath104@xmath60@xmath91 , according to @xmath105 before sampling the transverse momentum of each soft gluon , we will have to determine the slope @xmath106 of the particle @xmath104 distribution in the central region and the normalisation constant @xmath107 in ( 33 ) .",
    "we impose then another condition on the @xmath104 distribution , namely , that the transverse momentum distribution in @xmath104 of soft and hard gluons should be continuous at the @xmath104 cutoff ( 34 ) ( the same procedure was implemented in @xcite ) , @xmath108 we have then to solve two equations with two unknowns .",
    "the first condition is that the number of soft gluons should correspond to the soft cross section @xmath72 :    @xmath109    the second condition is that of the smooth transition between the soft and hard perturbative gluons transverse momentum distributions at the value of @xmath104 cutoff ( 34 ) , re - expressed as :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the full differential parton - parton hard cross section calculated at the value of @xmath112 .    in order to determine the four momentum of each outgoing remnant and each soft gluon , two additional conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously ; that of the total energy - momentum conservation between the initial beam - beam remnants ( remn@xmath113 ) and final ( remn@xmath113 + soft gluons ) states and that the outgoing soft gluons and remnants are on mass shell , with each remnant having the same mass before and after the soft interaction .",
    "once all four momenta of the outgoing remnants and soft gluons have been determined a new maximum longitudinal fractional momentum @xmath114 is calculated , according to ( 32 ) , for the next pair of soft gluons . the same chain of events , as described above , is then iterated until all soft interactions have been generated .",
    "if energy - momentum conservation is violated the scattering is vetoed .",
    "we will compare our model predictions with the experimental data coming from the study of the behaviour of the underlying event in hard scattering proton - antiproton collisions at 1.8 tev . in ref.@xcite",
    "the underlying event in hard proton - antiproton collisions is defined as all the ambient interactions surrounding the hard scattered jets .",
    "these ambient interactions include beam - beam remnants , initial and final - state radiation and multiple hard interactions , if they do occur .",
    "the beam - beam remnants are just what is left over after a parton has been taken out from each of the initial incoming hadrons .",
    "the jets in a hard interaction are produced by streams of outgoing hadrons with large transverse momentum , from partons that have undergone a hard two - to - two scattering . in interactions where a hard two - to - two subprocess occurred ,",
    "jets of hadrons are produced approximately back to back in azimuthal angle .",
    "this simple jet structure allows for the study of the particle distribution in azimuthal angle @xmath115 .",
    "there are three regions of study separated in @xmath116 from the leading highest @xmath104 jet ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the `` toward '' region containing the leading charged particle jets , the `` away '' region containing particles produced opposite in @xmath115 from the leading jet and the `` transverse '' region perpendicular to the plane of the hard two - to - two scattering which is the most sensitive region to the underlying event .    the simple jet algorithm used in @xcite builds jets from charged particles with @xmath104 @xmath28 0.5 gev and @xmath117@xmath118@xmath117 @xmath119 1 and is restricted to particle jets with transverse momentum less than 50 gev .",
    "the charged particles form jets of radius @xmath120 = 0.7 in @xmath118-@xmath115 space which contain particles from both underlying event and hard scattering .",
    "every charged particle is assigned to a jet with a possibility that some jets might consist of just one charged particle .",
    "the transverse momentum of the jet is defined as the scalar @xmath104 sum of all particles within the jet .",
    "once all jets have been produced the one with the highest @xmath104(jet@xmath121 ) is defined to be the leading jet .",
    "the experimental data are uncorrected and the theoretical simulated data are corrected for the track finding efficiency by removing , on average 8@xmath122 , of the charged particles .      a comparison between simulated ( corrected ) and experimental data is made and presented in figs 4 - 7 , with @xmath91 = 2.5 gev .",
    "the agreement seen in figs.6 and 7 is particularly important since the transverse region is the most sensitive to the underlying event activity . in figs.8 and 9",
    "we compare our predictions for the transverse region with those of the existing models ( without including pythia ) , herwig + underlying event model @xcite , herwig + multiparton hard model @xcite . in herwig",
    "s default underlying event model , the activity is enhanced in the transverse region by adding to its hard part a minimum bias event @xcite , based on the parametrisation of the ua5 @xmath47 minimum - bias data .",
    "as shown in figs.8 and 9 and in @xcite this model fails to produce enough activity for both the average number of charged particles and the average scalar @xmath104 sum and in addition has a wrong ( too steep ) @xmath104 dependence .",
    "overall our eikonal model is in better agreement with the experimental data than either of the two underlying event models .",
    "this result is even more significant since we did not fit to the experimental data but rather , make predictions based on the value of the total cross section used as phenomenological input to our model .      in the multiparton scattering model @xcite ,",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is a cutoff scale and plays a crucial role in determining the prediction of the model . in our eikonal model",
    "it is rather a matching scale between the hard and soft parts of the model .",
    "if the matching works perfectly , the results should be @xmath91 independent .    to test the invariance of the eikonal model to its @xmath91 parameter",
    "we simulate two sets of data , with two different values of @xmath91 = 2 gev and 3 gev in addition to the value of 2.5 gev , which we have already shown .",
    "the values of inclusive cross sections with the average number of soft and hard scatters are presented in table.1 .",
    ".values of inclusive cross sections and average numbers of hard and soft scatters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we show the results in fig.10 .",
    "we see that as expected the results in the multiparton model are strongly @xmath91 dependent , with smaller values of @xmath91 producing more activity . however , even the smallest value of @xmath91 is well below the data and no value of @xmath91 for which the hard part of herwig is reliable gives a good description of the data ( although it is worth noting that with @xmath91 fixed at 2.5 gev it is possible to fit the data by increasing the proton radius by a factor of about 1.7 @xcite .",
    "since this model does not provide any explanation of how the radius should vary as a function of center - of - mass energy , or for different collision types , we do not consider it to be useful phenomenologically ) .",
    "in contrast , our eikonal model has a smaller @xmath91 dependence , with the additional soft scatters providing extra activity to compensate for that lost from the hard scatters as @xmath91 increases .",
    "however , we see that they actually overcompensate , with decreasing @xmath91 leading to decreasing activity .",
    "this residual @xmath91 dependence indicates that the matching of the soft and the hard parts of the model is still not perfect and can perhaps be improved with further refinements of the model",
    ". nevertheless , we are satisfied that with such a simple , physically motivated and parameter free model , we have provided a significant improvement to the @xmath91 dependence and the description of data .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a monte carlo model , based on a simple eikonal model , for multiparticle production in hard proton - antiproton collisions .",
    "the model contains two parts , the hard part , which was already implemented @xcite ( running in conjunction with herwig ) , to which we have added a soft part , which uses showering and hadronisation models from herwig and allows us to extend our simulations to the non - perturbative soft region ( i.e. particles with @xmath124 ) .",
    "one of our goals was to produce a simple model ( with a minimum number of parameters ) which would be reasonably independent of the value chosen for the @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , the eikonal multiparticle approach to hadron - hardon scattering is particularly interesting since it prevents the calculated cross sections from violating unitarity at high energies . by fixing one parameter in our model , namely the total cross section ,",
    "we provide a good description of the measured data from @xcite with a reasonably small @xmath125 dependence .",
    "we have also shown that our model gives a better prediction than either the herwig + underlying event @xcite or herwig + hard multiparton @xcite models .",
    "our ultimate goal is to determine how much of the underlying event activity in the transverse region is due to the perturbative physics ( by including nlo calculations for example ) and how much is due to non - perturbative physics , and to make more reliable predictions of the underlying event .",
    "we are planning to test the model with the lower energy ua1 collaboration data , hera data , higher @xmath126 cdf data and give a prediction for the underlying event activity at the lhc .",
