    "meson exchanges do make good predictions for @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 @xcite phase shifts up to masses where @xmath39 resonances appear .",

    ", richard @xcite discusses the issues in terms of the flux - tubes within four - quark configurations .",
    "there is a further feature relevant to meson - meson configurations .",
    "the train of argument is as follows .",
    "many mesons are observed at or very close to thresholds of opening channels .",
    "well known examples are @xmath25 and @xmath24 at the @xmath35 threshold , @xmath44 ar the @xmath45 threshold and @xmath46 at the @xmath47 threshold within @xmath48 mev .",
    "the mechanism for this synchronisation is rather fundamental @xcite .",
    "the conventional form for the denominator of a resonance is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is lorentz invariant mass squared , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are coupling constants of open channels and @xmath53 are form factors .",
    "however , the correct form for @xmath54 is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the value of @xmath50 at the opening of the threshold and p denotes the principal value integral ; [ @xmath59 is the pole term from this expression . ]",
    "the origin of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is that amplitudes are analytic functions of @xmath50 , so that any change in the imaginary part of the amplitude must be accompanied by a change in the real part , or vice versa .",
    "1 sketches the behaviour of @xmath60 and @xmath61 at an s - wave threshold , @xmath35 in this example .",
    "the value of @xmath62 is large and peaks exactly at the @xmath63-wave threshold .",
    "it acts as an attractor and can explain why @xmath25 and @xmath24 lie very close to the @xmath35 threshold .",
    "the present limitation in calculating @xmath64 accurately is that form factors @xmath65 are poorly known .",
    "incidentally , eq . ( 2 ) is equivalent to solving schr \" odinger type equations , a procedure adopted by many authors .",
    "these solutions are explicitly analytic .",
    "it is also included in the model of van beveren and rupp , because their amplitudes are constructed algebraically to be analytic @xcite .",
    "-12 mm -6 mm    the hamiltonian for a @xmath18 state decaying to meson - meson obeys @xmath66 @xmath67 describes short - range @xmath18 components and @xmath68 refers to ingoing and outgoing mesonic channels and must include @xmath69- and @xmath70-channel meson exchanges ; @xmath71 accounts for the coupling between them due to @xmath50-channel decays . the eigenfunction @xmath72 becomes a linear combination of @xmath18 and meson - meson .",
    "the latter is not an ` optional extra ' ; if a resonance decays to meson - meson , that component is a necessary part of the wave function , and indeed plays a vital role .",
    "this is the basis of a large number of papers by oset and collaborators , enumerating the attractive meson - meson contributions to a large number of mesons , e.g. @xcite ; their calculations include empirical short - range terms which may well simulate @xmath18 contributions .    the form of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is strictly analogous to the formation of covalent bonds in chemistry @xcite . according to the variational principle , the eigenstate minimises the eigenvalue .",
    "the @xmath18 component is of short range .",
    "mixing with meson - meson components at longer range lowers momentum components in the wave function and hence the energy eigenvalue .",
    "the @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are very narrow and it is a good approximation to view them as pure @xmath77 states . some commentators then argue that other mesons can not be @xmath12 or @xmath17 because they have unexpected meson - meson components .",
    "that is wrong .",
    "if a resonance is close to an opening threshold with the same quantum numbers , it must contain virtual components of that channel .",

    "all these states lie close to the @xmath94 threshold .",

    "spin - parity determinations of these states are presently lacking .",
    "this appears to be due to the fact that only decays have been analysed ; that leads to ambiguities .",
    "it is essential to analyse the full process of production and decay , as in the analysis of dalitz plots .",
    "this leads to orthogonal matrix elements between all @xmath97 .",
    "the ideal process for analysis is @xmath98 ; here @xmath99 and @xmath100 both have spin 0 , making the formulae rather simple .",
    "formulae for this process were published in 2005 @xcite , but experimental groups have not taken advantage of spin information from decays of @xmath101 and @xmath73 ; that is essential because it determines spin alignments . with the full formulae",
