    "in other words the question is : does the algorithm produce a larger error while calculating the volume of blebbing cells , with respect to those where blebs are absent ?    to answer to this question we generate a set of synthetic ellipsoidal cells whose volume is in the range of the zebrafish cells analyzed in our experiments ( @xmath90 ) , as shown in fig.[fig : synthetic_blebs ] .",

    "the volumes of the extracted meshes are reported in fig.[fig : volume_ellipsoids_comparison ] ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "it is apparent that the algorithm systematically underestimates the volume by roughly @xmath100 .",
    "we checked that is error is greatly reduced for isotropic voxels .",
    "a constant systematic error is not worrying , since we are only interested in changes in volume and all the images have the same voxel anisotropy and therefore the same error . before addressing the fluctuations of this error , we focus on possible spurious changes in the measured volume induced by a change in shape .",
    "for each of the synthetic ellipsoidal cells , we create a synthetic cell with the same volume but presenting 1 , 2 , or 3 blebs on the surface .",
    "blebs are generated as spherical caps of different radii with centers placed randomly on the ellipsoid surface ( see fig.[fig : synthetic_blebs](d ) ) .",

    "what is surprising , however , is that cells with blebs appear to approximate the real volume slightly better than cells without blebs . to confirm this",

    "if no errors were made by the algorithm in estimating the synthetic volumes one would expect @xmath105 since pair of cells were constructed with the same volume but different shapes .",
    "if complex shape with blebs would lead to an overestimation of the volume with respect an ellipsoidal cell with no blebs , one would expect @xmath103 and @xmath104 to be positively correlated . to the contrary",
    ", the linear regression of the data in fig.[fig : volume - error - vss ] shows a small but clear anti - correlation between volume and surface fluctuations .",
    "this is in contrast with experimental results showing that changes in shape are positively correlated with changes in volume ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vs_correlations ] ) .",
    "hence , this result can not be considered an artefact of the measurement but a real feature of the cells .",
    "the previous analysis clearly demonstrates that the volume fluctuations observed in our experiments do not depend on the shape of the cells , but the algorithm systematically underestimates the volume of both of about @xmath102 .",
    "the next question is whether these systematic fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the observed ones .",
    "are the fluctuations reported in fig .",
    "1(b ) real or just an artefact introduced by the mesh reconstruction algorithm ?",
    "this question is particularly compelling in the case of wt and aqp+ cells , since for dn - rok and aqp- cells we can accept that the volume might remain constant . to answer to this question",
    "generate a set of 120 synthetic cells , 60 with blebs randomly placed and of different sizes , and 60 without blebs , each cell having its own real volume @xmath95 calculated with imagej .",
    "we then process each synthetic cell according to the protocol previously outlined : anysotropic voxelization in the z direction and subsequent mesh analysis .",
    "finally we calculate the fluctuations @xmath106 and its cumulative distribution @xmath107 . in fig.[fig : cumulative_fluctuation_ellipsoids_comparison_cell ] we compare @xmath107 with the corresponding cumulative distributions of wt , aqp+ , dn - rok and aqp- cells , once it has been shifted by the average systematic volume bias @xmath108 .",
    "this figure shows that systematic errors made by icy in the estimation of the cell volume , are compatible with the observed volume fluctuations of dn - rok and aqp- cells , but not with those aqp+ and wt cells , which instead appear to be significantly larger .",
    "we thus conclude that the difference in volume fluctuation between aqp+/wt cells and dn - rok / aqp- is not an artefact of the analysis .      by performing numerical simulations",
    ", we notice that a straightforward formulation of the method suffers from poor volume conservation .",

    "<S> the membrane permeability in zebrafish embryos has been measured experimentally and is reported to be in the range @xmath86 depending on the developmental stage @xcite . here , we perform numerical simulations under different values of @xmath18 , ranging from @xmath85 to @xmath87 , to account for aqp overexpression and knockdown ( see table s1 for a complete list of parameters ) . when @xmath18 is in the physiological range , we observe realistic bleb formation and retraction ( fig .

    "<S> furthermore , it allows to generate large membrane deflections needed to form a bleb . in differentiated cells </S>",
    "<S> additional membrane surface can be obtained by disassembling caveolae @xcite , but this can not happen in pgcs where caveolin is not expressed . when the interface fractures , the mechanical stress on the detached part of the membrane decreases , but it increases on the interface that is still attached , inducing crack propagation . as the bleb expands , the fluid pressure inside the cell is reduced ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> these pressure spikes , whose distribution is long - tailed ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : drop]b ) , are a manifestation of the stress concentrations around cracks and are needed to account for the observed volume fluctuations , because otherwise the average pressure jump generated by a uniform cortex contraction ( around @xmath89 pa ) would not displace sufficient amount of fluid during the short lifetime of a bleb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> healing of the membrane - cortex interface eventually leads to bleb retraction and to an increased fluid pressure inside the cell . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism described above does not work for an impermeable membrane : isochoric buckling is possible in principle but , in addition to bending , it necessarily causes considerable stretching which is energetically expensive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the interface fractures the bleb does not form and interface delamination takes place without localized membrane expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that volume fluctuations during blebbing are due to mechanically induced highly non - uniform pressure drops across the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the same mechanism could also explain the experimental observation that blebs are nucleated preferentially in regions of negative membrane curvature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> changes in osmotic pressure gradients could also contribute to the process , as suggested previously @xcite , but are not explicitly included in our model . </S>",
    "<S> future experimental work will clarify if this and other assumptions present in our model are correct , but our results should stimulate both new experiments and the development of more elaborate theories and models . </S>",
    "<S> this would also allow to better understand the role of transmembrane water transport for other cellular protrusions , given that past experimental results relate the presence of aquaporins to the formation of lamellipodia @xcite and filopodia @xcite . </S>",
