    "measurements of the energy spectrum and the elemental composition of the primary cosmic radiation constrain theoretical models of the sources , acceleration mechanisms and transport of the radiation through the interstellar space .",
    "while for lower energies direct measurements by satellites or balloon - borne detectors yield spectroscopic results ( see ref.@xcite ) , for primary energies above some @xmath1ev only indirect measurements via extensive air shower ( eas ) observations can be performed .",
    "it is well known that the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic radiation shows a kink ( mostly referred to as `` knee '' ) at energies around 3  pev @xcite . though the first evidence of the existence of this knee has been presented more than 40 years ago @xcite ,",
    "the knowledge of the detailed structure of the spectrum in the pev region is still scarce , and the origin of the knee not yet understood .",
    "+ most of the earth - bound air shower experiments use large detector arrays to measure charged particles and reconstruct shower sizes of the individual events by adjusting a particular lateral distribution function to the measured densities .",
    "the resulting shower size spectra reflect the primary energy spectrum , but a quantitative conversion to energy has to invoke a model of the shower development and on an assumption of a mass composition .",
    "hence the determination of the energy spectrum is affected by different systematic uncertainties , especially by the dependence on the model of high - energy interactions .",
    "this also leads to a mutual dependence of the results for the energy spectrum and mass composition .",
    "+ when comparing recent results of earth - bound air shower experiments , like casa - mia  @xcite , tibet  @xcite or akeno  @xcite , significant differences in the absolute magnitudes of the total flux , the knee position and slope of the energy spectrum are noticed . a recent non - parametric analysis of kascade data @xcite reports equally large differences on the energy spectra , depending on the high - energy hadronic interaction model , illustrating the considerable influence of the interaction models underlying the monte carlo simulations .",
    "to identify the ultimate sources of the disagreements , it would be useful to analyze different experiments on basis of a coherent methodology as well as to compare the resulting features for various sets of different eas parameters in the individual experiments .",
    "+ in the present paper we endeavor to analyze the frequency distribution of local muon densities at fixed distances from the shower core .",
    "the local muon density spectra reflect the gross features of the primary energy spectrum , as the muon content for a certain distance to the shower center observed at sea - level is mainly determined by the primary energy . while the reconstruction of electron or muon size spectra necessarily implies a choice of the form of the lateral distribution function , spectra of the muon density are free from this bias .",
    "thus with `` independent '' measurements of such spectra for different fixed core distances allow a check on the lateral distribution obtained from simulations .",
    "in addition , the layout of the kascade experiment  @xcite , with a central detector system consisting of densely packed muon counters with different shielding , enables the study of density spectra for two different muon energy thresholds .",
    "hence the consistency of the simulations with respect to the muon energy spectrum can be performed .",
    "kascade ( karlsruhe shower core and array detector ) is a multi - detector setup @xcite at forschungszentrum karlsruhe ( @xmath2 m a.s.l . ) , germany , for eas measurements in the primary energy range around the knee .",
    "the main detector components of kascade used for the present analysis are an `` array '' of 252 stations , located on a squared grid with @xmath3 m spacing and a `` central detector '' comprising additional detector systems .",
    "+ the array is organized in 16 subarrays ( @xmath4 stations each ) and provides the data necessary for the reconstruction of the basic eas characteristics like electron and muon size ( total number of electrons and muons in the eas ) , core location , and arrival direction of individual air showers .",
    "the special arrangement of shielded and unshielded detectors on top of each other allows an independent estimation of the total electron and muon number for each individual shower .",
    "the densities are estimated and corrected iteratively for punch - through effects ( @xmath5-counters ) and muon contamination ( @xmath6-counters ) .",
    "lateral correction functions from simulations of eas and detectors are used .",
    "the reconstructed particle densities are fitted by nishimura - kamata - greisen ( nkg ) functions in the experimental accessible distance ranges ( 10 - 200@xmath7 m for the electron component , 40 - 200@xmath7 m for the muon component ) .",
    "the densities obtained are then integrated from zero to infinity for the total numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in addition we quote the so - called truncated numbers for which the nkg functions are integrated in a limited range only ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "these truncated numbers provide reduced systematic uncertainties since extrapolations into the radial range outside our measurement areas are avoided .",
    "uncertainties are estimated by monte carlo calculations and range below 20% for the total numbers and even better for the truncated numbers .",
    "the location of the shower core once inside a fiducial area is determined to better than 3@xmath7 m .",
    "the arrival direction of the shower is reconstructed from the arrival times of eas particles ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these procedures are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "+ the kascade central detector is placed at the geometrical center of the detector array .",
    "it consists of four different detector systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : calo ] ) , covering a total area of 16@xmath1320@xmath7m@xmath14 .",
    "the local muon density of eas is measured with the multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) and the trigger plane . + below the hadron calorimeter  @xcite , with a total thickness of 5@xmath7 cm lead , 154@xmath7 cm steel , and 77@xmath7 cm concrete corresponding to a threshold for vertical muons of 2.4@xmath7gev , a setup of 32 large    multiwire proportional chambers is installed @xcite .",
    "the chambers of three different sizes ( 5@xmath7m@xmath14 , 8.2@xmath7m@xmath14 , and 8.8@xmath7m@xmath14 ) are arranged in two layers with 38@xmath7 cm vertical distance . in total",
    "each layer has a sensitive area of 129@xmath7m@xmath14 .",
    "a single chamber consists of two layers of cathode strips at angles of @xmath15 with respect to a layer of anode wires in between .",
    "the chambers are operated with an argon - methane gas mixture .",
    "the electronics allows a digital readout of all wires and strips , i.e. in total of c. 32,000 channels .",
    "hits of through - going particles are reconstructed as the intersection of the anode wires and the cathode strips .",
    "thresholds and delays are adjustable for each channel separately .",
    "a continuous monitoring of the reconstruction efficiency during measurements is performed .",
    "the chambers have a spatial resolution of about 5@xmath7 mm .",
    "+ the reconstruction of high - energy muons in the mwpc starts from the reconstructed hits in each plane and the shower direction .",
    "the reconstructed direction is required to agree with the shower direction within @xmath16 in zenith and @xmath17 in azimuth ( the azimuth cut is not used for showers with zenith angles of @xmath18 ) .",
    "these cuts appear reasonable as for core distances below 100@xmath7 m high - energy muon tracks are nearly parallel to the shower axis .",
    "it is known from simulations that in the considered range of primary energy ( pev ) and core distances the muon density ( for @xmath19gev ) very rarely exceeds 1 per m@xmath14",
    ". therefore reconstruction ambiguities are negligible .",
    "high - energy @xmath20-electrons which are produced to a small amount in the absorber are eliminated by calculating the height of the intersection of two nearby tracks .",
    "if they cross inside the central detector , the track with the larger deviation from the shower axis is rejected while the other is accepted as a muon only .",
    "about @xmath21 of tracks are rejected by this cut .",
    "the spatial resolution of single tracks is about 1.0@xmath7 cm , the angular resolution is @xmath22 . the number of tracked muons @xmath23 is also corrected for the reconstruction efficiency which is estimated for each single data acquisition run ( @xmath24h ) separately .",
    "the efficiency was found to be very stable with a mean value of @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the local muon density @xmath26 for each eas is defined by @xmath23 divided by the total sensitive area @xmath27 of the mwpc setup . due to the layout of the chambers ,",
    "@xmath27 depends on the angle of incidence of the shower and is calculated for each event individually ( @xmath28m@xmath14 for the selected eas ) .",
    "only that area where muons parallel to the shower axis would penetrate the whole absorber and both chamber planes , is taken into account for the calculation of the muon density .",
    "+ the second detector system is a layer of 456 plastic scintillation detectors in the third gap of the calorimeter , called trigger plane  @xcite .",
    "each detector consists of two square plates of plastic scintillators ( 47.5@xmath1347.5@xmath29@xmath30 ) separated by a wavelength - shifter , which is read out by a single photomultiplier .",
    "fast electronics records low - energy ( muons ) and high - energy deposits ( cascading hadrons ) and provides a trigger for the calorimeter and other detector systems . in the present analysis the trigger plane with an active area of 208@xmath7m@xmath14 is used to estimate the local density of muons with a threshold of 490@xmath7mev for vertical incidence .",
    "+ the muon density @xmath31 at the trigger plane is reconstructed in the following way : to remove signals from cascading hadrons in the absorber an upper limit of the energy deposit of @xmath32mev in each of the 456 scintillation counters is imposed .",
    "detectors with larger energy deposits and their immediate neighbours are not considered for further reconstruction . for the remaining detectors , the energy deposit and the sensitive area ,",
    "both corrected for the shower direction , are summed up . the number of reconstructed muons @xmath33 is then calculated by the sum of the energy deposits divided by the mean energy deposit of a single muon in the shower . according to monte carlo calculations this mean value depends slightly on the core distance @xmath34 ( @xmath35 in mev ) and",
    "is corrected for .",
    "@xmath34 is the distance in meter of the core position to the center of the trigger plane ( or mwpc ) projected to a plane perpendicular to the shower axis .",
    "the density @xmath31 is obtained as ratio of @xmath33 and the sensitive area of the trigger plane for each individual event ( @xmath36m@xmath14 ) . + the mwpc setup is triggered by trigger plane and top cluster , but not by the detector array .",
    "but the array , trigger plane and the top cluster are triggering all other components .",
    "the trigger plane fires if more than 7 detectors have signals @xmath37mip or if at least one detector has @xmath38mev ( for single hadron detection ) .",

    "an array trigger is activated if half of the stations of at least one subarray show an energy deposit ( @xmath37mip ) .",
    "one of the central detector triggers in conjunction with the array trigger have to be active to initiate the event reconstruction . + after some general cuts ( core position less than @xmath39 m from array center , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , more than two million events have been used for the present analysis , recorded in circa 282 days of measuring time .",
    "measured fluxes have been corrected by @xmath42 for the dead - time of the data acquisition system .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that at a fixed distance from the shower axis the local muon densities map the energy of the primary particles  @xcite and that muon density spectra carry information about the primary energy spectra . +",
    "the reconstruction of muon density spectra have been performed for two energy thresholds and for nine core distance ranges ( figures  [ fig : specmw ] and  [ fig : spectp ] ) .",
    "these ranges are chosen in such a way that the sampling area are of equal size ( 1473.4  m@xmath14 ) and large enough to get reasonable statistical accuracy but retain small systematic uncertainties due to the extension of the core distance bins . to suppress punch - through effects of the hadronic or electromagnetic component , eas with @xmath43 m",
    "are excluded .",
    "eas with @xmath44 m are excluded , too , because they can have their core outside the kascade array ( @xmath45 m ) if they are very inclined .",
    "the @xmath46-spectra are affected by trigger efficiencies at low densities .",
    "the limitation at high densities are given by reconstruction uncertainties .",
    "for the mwpc system ( higher energy threshold ) these uncertainties begin at a fixed muon density of @xmath47m@xmath48 due to ambiguities in the track reconstruction and punch - through effects of cascading hadrons .",
    "the hadronic energy and hadron particle density in eas are increasing similarly to the muon density at all core distances  @xcite . in case of the trigger plane the cut on the deposited energy ( @xmath32mev ) in each scintillation detector has a systematic influence on local densities above @xmath49m@xmath48 . here",

    "the values of the boundaries are estimated by the method of finite and dividing differences @xcite .",
    "especially the lower thresholds of the spectra , where they begin to deviate from a power law dependence are defined by this method .",
    "with increasing core distances these trigger thresholds move to lower muon densities because of the decreasing lateral distribution function .",
    "the position of the knee is calculated as the weighted center of gravity of the bins inside the knee region .",
    "the fit functions are included in figures  [ fig : specmw ] and [ fig : spectp ] , as well as the particular position of the bending .",
    "the `` width '' of the knee region for all spectra amounts to @xmath55 .",
    "+ it is a remarkable observation that within the statistical uncertainty the knee positions for all spectra occur at the same eas flux , for both thresholds and all core distances ( at a differential flux of @xmath56 m@xmath48s@xmath57sr@xmath58 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : knee ] displays the knee positions for all reconstructed spectra .",
    "if we assume that the knee is a feature of the primary energy spectrum , the data points mark the lateral distribution of muons for two different energy thresholds for a fixed primary cosmic ray energy .",
    "this shows that , for the eas registered , the fraction of muons between @xmath59mev and @xmath60gev is small .",
    "figure  [ fig : betas ] shows the power law indices of the density spectra . a higher muon energy threshold results in steeper spectra .",
    "this indicates a comparatively larger increase of the muon density per primary energy interval with increasing muon energy threshold .",
    "the spectra for different core distances are almost parallel leading to nearly constant indices for a given muon energy threshold .",
    "this confirms previous experimental results  @xcite of only slight changes of the shape of the muon lateral distributions with increasing primary energy ( which is different for the electromagnetic component of eas ) . for both energy thresholds",
    "there is a clear difference in the indices below and above the knee .",
    "+ several tests were performed to check the robustness of the shape of the reconstructed spectra against experimental uncertainties or systematic features of the analysis .",
    "differently chosen functional forms for the fit procedure to the differential spectra result in similar indices of the power laws .",
    "the significance of the knee remains stable ( see also dashed lines in figure  [ fig : spectp ] ) .",
    "the assumption of a single power law for the spectra ( e.g. dashed line figure  [ fig : specmw ] ) leads to reduced @xmath61-values of around @xmath62 , whereas the used procedures fit the data with @xmath61-values close to one .",
    "in addition , it has been found that effects of the binning of the density and of the core ranges , or of the azimuthal distribution of the showers are negligible and within the statistical uncertainty of the spectra .",
    "variations of the chosen zenith angle range shift the total spectrum in @xmath46 slightly , but the form of the spectra remains stable .",
    "this is reasonable , because differently inclined showers ( of the same primary energy ) generate slightly different numbers of muons , while the variation of the density with energy does not change .",
    "the ratio of the muon to electron content of eas is traditionally considered as a mass - sensitive observable  @xcite , since heavy ion induced eas tend to have a large ratio due to the faster development of the electromagnetic component in the atmosphere .",
    "the shower sizes @xmath8 and @xmath63 have been reconstructed for each individual event from the data of the array stations and the eas have been classified according to the ratio and then    divided in `` electron - rich '' and `` electron - poor '' .",
    "the shower sizes are converted to the sizes of vertical showers to eliminate the influence of the different zenith angles : + @xmath64 + @xmath65 + where @xmath8 , @xmath63 , and @xmath66 are the reconstructed quantities of the eas , and @xmath67g / cm@xmath14 is the observation level .",
    "the quantities @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the absorption lengths of the electron and muon components in the atmosphere .",
    "the values were obtained from monte carlo simulations and parameterised as @xmath71g / cm@xmath14 and @xmath72 .",
    "especially the electron number depends significantly on the zenith angle due to the rapidly increasing atmospheric absorption .",
    "the separation of the total sample of eas in `` electron - rich '' and `` electron - poor '' showers is performed by a cut in the ratio @xmath73 .",
    "this value is optimized by monte carlo calculations ( see section  [ simul ] ) . the classification is done independently using the local muon densities at the central detector .",
    "for both subsamples the spectra are deduced in the same way as the `` all - particle '' spectra . + as example figure  [ fig : rspec ] shows    the reconstructed local muon density spectra for @xmath74 m for all , for the electron - rich ( predominantly light ion induced ) , and for the electron - poor ( predominantly heavy ion induced ) showers .",
    "the general features of the spectra are similar for all core distance ranges ; the component of electron - rich eas dominates the flux below the knee while it strongly decreases after the kink .",
    "no knee is seen in the component of electron - poor eas , and the spectra can be described by a single power law .",
    "the resulting slopes of the spectra , especially the differences of the slope - values for the two thresholds and subsamples , are very similar for the various core distances as shown in figure  [ fig : betasr ] .",
    "whereas the assumed fit functions describe the all - particle spectra well , the spectra for the electron - rich eas are not well described by power laws above the knee . also for the electron - poor sample slight deviations from a pure power law dependence at the high energy end are observed .",
    "this holds for all radial ranges .",
    "an energy dependent separation efficiency of the primary masses as well as astrophysical sources ( composition , acceleration , propagation ) can cause these deviations from simple power law dependencies .",
    "for the interpretation of the measured muon density spectra in terms of the primary energy spectrum a - priori knowledge inferred from monte carlo simulations of the air - shower development is necessary .",

    "systematic uncertainties are at the 10% level and indicated in figure  [ fig : deltas ] .",
    "these systematics are estimated by varying the energy and angular spectrum of the simulated events , as well as modifying the degree of fluctuation of the observables resulting from the simulations .",

    "+ with help of the muon to electron number ratio , estimated on an event - by - event basis , the registered eas are divided into electron - rich and electron - poor subsamples .",
    "the subsample of the electron - rich eas shows the same knee features as the total sample but with a more pronounced knee .",
    "the electron - poor sample shows no change of slope within the density range investigated .",
    "an identical feature has also been observed in combined energy and composition analyses of size spectra measured by kascade  @xcite albeit then based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "simulations indicate that electron - rich showers originate from light primary nuclei .",
    "this feature holds irrespectively of details of the interaction models .",
    "hence we conclude that the knee reflects a feature of the light particle spectrum and that the spectrum of heavy particles does not change slope in the range of our measurements .",
    "such a behaviour is expected if the knee is caused either by interstellar magnetic fields or a change of the interaction in the atmosphere since in these cases the knee of nuclei should be displaced by a factor of z or a , respectively , to that of protons .",
    "+ detailed eas and detector simulations were used to interpret the measured muon density spectra in terms of the primary energy spectrum .",
    "independent of the elemental composition assumed all measured spectra should result in the same primary energy spectrum , irrespectively of core distance or muon threshold .",
    "however , only when assuming the true composition the derived energy spectrum will be the correct one .",
    "this agreement for different spectra actually is observed for varying core distances .",
    "hence we conclude that the muon lateral distribution is sufficiently well represented by the simulations .",
    "in contrast , the results for the two energy thresholds lead to different exponents and positions of the kinks .",
    "these differences are larger than the systematic uncertainties due to the unknown composition , especially in the case of the subsamples .",
    "thus , the measurements presented here reveal that the monte carlo simulations are not capable to describe the muon energy distribution correctly .",
    "such indications arise also from studies of the muon lateral distributions for different muon energy thresholds with kascade  @xcite . in view of these systematic discrepancies , it is difficult to draw definite conclusions but some general features of the primary energy spectrum can be stated : the all - particle energy spectrum exhibits a knee at @xmath120ev with a change of the spectral index of order @xmath121 .",
    "this knee is only seen in the light ion subsample , at the same position but with a distinctly larger steepening of @xmath122 .",
    "the heavy ion component of the cosmic ray flux displays no steepening in the energy range of 110 pev and a smaller slope than the light component below the knee . within the uncertainties the findings about the all - particle spectrum are compatible with recent results from kascade  @xcite and other experiments  @xcite .",
    "+ from the experimental point of view the study of muon density spectra establishes a new approach to investigate the energy spectrum of cosmic rays .",
    "although the statistical accuracy is limited the measured spectra reflect the features of the primary energy spectrum in an astonishingly direct manner .",
    "but considerable inconsistencies arise when attempting to convert the measured muon density spectra into the primary energy spectrum based on simulations .",
    "it is only due to multiparameter measurements of experiments such as kascade that the deficiencies of the simulations get revealed .",
    "thus improvements of the hadronic interaction models incorporated in the simulations appear to be the most important prerequisite for a consistent interpretation of the data in terms of elemental composition and energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays in the knee region .",
    "the authors would like to thank the members of the engineering and technical staff of the kascade collaboration who contributed to the success of the experiment with enthusiasm and commitment .",
