    "the partonic quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be calculated in pqcd . since @xmath15 production is dominated by gluon - gluon and quark - gluon scattering in the measured @xmath32 range ( @xmath33  gev/@xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is directly sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution function in the proton .",
    "cross section measurements at rhic have established the validity of using a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd description at @xmath11 gev for inclusive mid - rapidity @xmath2 @xcite and forward @xmath2 production  @xcite , and for mid - rapidity jet  @xcite and direct photon production  @xcite . however , at lower center of mass energy , nlo pqcd calculations have been less successful in describing the data  @xcite . the inclusion of `` threshold resummation '' at next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy ( nll )  @xcite improves the agreement between theory and data at fixed - target energies .",
    "while taking into account threshold logarithms at the fixed - target kinematic region is essential , they may also need to be accounted for at @xmath1 gev , but will provide a smaller effect  @xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of the inclusive @xmath15 production cross section at @xmath1  gev is important for the heavy - ion program at rhic . a new state of dense matter is formed in au+au collisions at 200  gev and parton energy loss in the produced dense medium results in high @xmath32 leading hadron suppression .",

    "the emcal comprises two calorimeter types : 6 sectors of lead scintillator sampling calorimeter ( pbsc ) and 2 sectors of a lead glass cherenkov calorimeter ( pbgl ) .",
    "each of the emcal towers was calibrated by the two - photon invariant mass from @xmath15 decays and cross checked against the energy deposited by the minimum ionizing particles in the emcal , and the correlation between the measured momenta of electron and positron tracks and the associated energy deposited in the emcal .",
    "the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale was 1.2% .",
    "the @xmath15 data in this analysis were collected using two different triggers .",
    "one is a beam - beam counter ( bbc ) trigger which was defined by the coincidence of signals in two bbcs located at pseudorapidities @xmath39 with full azimuthal coverage  @xcite .",
    "the time difference between the two bbcs was used to determine the collision vertex along the beam axis , which in this analysis was required to be within 30 cm from the center of the phenix interaction region ( ir ) .",
    "the other trigger is an emcal - based high @xmath32 photon trigger , in which threshold discrimination corresponding to a deposited energy of  0.8 gev was applied independently to sums of analog signals from @xmath40 groupings of adjacent emcal towers @xcite .",
    "this trigger had limited efficiency for @xmath15 detection at low @xmath32 ( e.g.  50% in 1.01.5 gev/@xmath5 @xmath32 bin ) and close to @xmath41 efficiency at @xmath423 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "beam - beam counters along with zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite , which detect neutral particles near the beam axis ( @xmath43 mrad ) , were utilized to determine the integrated luminosity for the analyzed data sample needed for the absolute normalization of the measured cross sections .",
    "trigger counts defined with the bbcs and zdcs were also used for the precise measurements of the relative luminosity between bunches with different spin configuration , and the spin dependence of very forward neutron production  @xcite , detected by the zdcs , served for monitoring the orientation of the beam polarization in the phenix interaction region ( ir ) through the run .",

    "the unpolarized cross section analysis technique was very similar to our analyses of @xmath11 gev data @xcite and is briefly discussed in section [ label : xsec_analysis ] .",

    "one of the main corrections applied to the measured @xmath15 spectrum is the bbc trigger bias @xmath48 , which is defined as the fraction of high @xmath32 @xmath15 events in the mid - rapidity spectrometer acceptance which fire the bbc trigger .",

    "figure  [ fig : all ] also shows a set of @xmath6 curves from pqcd calculations that incorporates different scenarios for gluon polarization within the grsv parameterization of the polarized parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "grsv - std corresponds to the best fit to inclusive dis data .",
    "the other three scenarios in fig.[fig : all ] ( grsv - max , @xmath157 , and @xmath159 ) are based on the best fit , but use the functions @xmath160 at the initial scale for parton evolution ( @xmath161 gev@xmath162 ) , where @xmath163 is the unpolarized gluon distribution , and @xmath164 is the difference between the distribution of gluons with the same and opposite helicity to the parent proton . in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] , we compare our asymmetry data with both nlo and nll calculations .",
    "the nll calculations indicate that we have a reduced sensitivity to positive @xmath14 , but the effect is far less pronounced than at fermilab fixed - target energies  @xcite .",
    "similar to our @xmath11 gev results @xcite , our @xmath1 gev @xmath6 data do not support a large gluon polarization scenario , such as grsv - max .",

    "the range of @xmath10 in each bin is broad and spans the range @xmath165 , as calculated by nlo pqcd  @xcite .",
    "thus our data set extends our @xmath10 reach of sensitivity to @xmath14 and also overlaps previous measurements , providing measurements with the same @xmath10 but at a different @xmath166 scale .",
    "to summarize , we have presented the unpolarized cross section and double helicity asymmetries for @xmath2 production at mid - rapidity , for proton - proton collisions at @xmath1 gev .",
    "the accuracy of the cross - section measurements , which fall within the large spread of isr data , relies on direct @xmath15 two - photon decay reconstruction , precise calibration of the photon energy measurements , careful study of the trigger performance and accurate control of the integrated luminosity of the analyzed data sample .",
    "the results serve as a precise baseline for heavy - ion measurements .",
    "comparisons to nlo and nll theoretical calculations indicate that including the effects of threshold logarithms may be necessary to more accurately describe the cross section at @xmath1 gev .",
    "the @xmath6 results extend the sensitivity to the polarized gluon distribution in the proton to higher @xmath10 compared to the previous measurements at @xmath11  gev .",
    "a preliminary version of these double helicity asymmetry results was already used in a recent global fit of both rhic and polarized dis data to constrain @xmath14 @xcite .",
