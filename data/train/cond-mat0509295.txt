    "there is just a small difference in the temperature between the main peak at t@xmath7 and the anomaly at 130 k and one can not be sure with which peak to associate this event .",
    "for that reason we have measured the x = 0.7 material for which the main peak is at 90 k and it clearly indicates that the observed dynamics is not connected with the small anomaly around 130 k but rather with the main peak at t@xmath7 which , in turn , depends on the eu / ce ratio .",

    "this featureless curve resembles the shape of the butterfly hysteresis characterizing ru1212 material below its magnetic ordering transition  @xcite . at 78 k ( bottom panel )",
    "the inverted peak is well - defined and dominates in the hysteretic behavior .",
    "( @xmath9 ) - virgin branch ; ( @xmath10 ) - descending field branch ; ( @xmath11 ) - ascending field branch . ]",
    "in addition to the temperature dependence of the butterfly hysteresis for the ru1222 material , we have investigated the influence of the maximum dc field one reaches in cycling the dc field .",
    "[ maxdc ] shows how the inverted peak ( h@xmath13 ) emerges for small dc fields ( above 25 oe ) and eventually completely overwhelms the underlying ferromagnetic behavior for larger dc fields where it tends to saturate ( here _ larger _ denotes a few hundred oe ) .",
    "after the careful analysis has been done and the ferromagnetic background has been subtracted , one gets the dependence of the inverted peak h@xmath13 vs. maximum dc field imposed on the system h@xmath21 , shown in the inset of fig .",

    "one should note that there is no sign of the h@xmath13 peak in the descending field branch ( squares ) for h@xmath25 0 nor in the ascending field branch ( triangles ) for h@xmath26 0 .",
    "also , it seems that the h@xmath12 peak is linked only to the virgin curve resembling the s - shaped vsm virgin curve ( see fig .",
    "[ srruo3hys]b ) and has no influence on the behavior of the inverted part .     for h@xmath21 = 350 oe .",

    "as has been recently proposed  @xcite , ru1222 materials consist of two phases , the minority one that orders around 180 k and the majority one that orders around 100 k ( depending on the eu / ce ratio ) .",
    "exact nature of both orderings is still unclear .",
    "although ferromagnetic - like features have been observed , detailed investigation of butterfly hysteresis in ru1222 reveals a more complex magnetism characterizing this material .",
    "temperature dependence of the inverted part ( fig .",
    "[ hystemp ] ) shows that it emerges at the main peak t@xmath7 where the majority phase orders , progressively freezing out as the temperature is lowered .",
    "we have investigated samples with x from 0.5 to 1.0 and they all show the same behavior , suggesting similar magnetic ordering to take place in all compositions .",
    "the h@xmath14 peak , which marks the coercive field , gradually increases as the temperature is decreased and reaches the value of 100 oe for 4.2 k. it can be compared with the values of 250 oe obtained in  @xcite for much larger maximum fields ( 50 koe ) . from the figs .",
    "[ hystemp ] and  [ maxdc ] it is obvious that h@xmath14 is not affected by the presence of the inverted peak , suggesting two separate contributions to the ac susceptibility .    presently , we are unable to provide a full interpretation of the exponential dependence shown in the inset of the fig .",
    "[ maxdc ] .",
    "we note however that it indicates the presence of some fundamental interaction which is susceptible to small magnetic fields . also , a remarkable fact is that no feature can be seen in the magnetization measurements ( either vsm or squid ) that would correspond to the inverted part of the butterfly hysteresis .",
    "we suggest that the inverted behavior might reflect the interaction of the two magnetic phases , namely the ferromagnetic clusters and the background matrix , ordering at t@xmath6 and at t@xmath7 , respectively . as suggested by cardoso et al .",
    "@xcite the phenomenology of spin glasses could be relevant for ru1222 as well .",
    "indeed , we have observed the frequency dependence of the main peak at t@xmath7(not shown ) .",
    "the magnitude of the shift follows the spin - glass - like behavior  @xcite but the magnitude of the ac susceptibility signal is orders of magnitude larger than for the usual spin - glass material . we speculate that the ferromagnetic clusters , randomly distributed and oriented in matrix , could impose a frustration on the surrounding matrix , giving rise to the spin - glass behavior and the observed frequency dependence .",
    "we have measured the butterfly hysteresis for the ru1222 material and have found that it consists of two components .",
    "the first one comes from the already observed ferromagnetic - like behavior of the compound and is represented by the coercive field peak .",
    "the second component is responsible for the onset of the inverted peak in butterfly hysteresis , formed after the dc field reaches its maximum value and starts reducing .",
    "the inverted part disappears as the temperature is lowered while the coercive maximum just shifts to larger values .",
    "exponential dependence of the inverted peak vs. maximum dc field has been observed but it s microscopic background is not well understood as yet .",
    "interaction between ferromagnetic clusters and the ordered matrix embedding the clusters has been proposed to account for the observed behavior .",
