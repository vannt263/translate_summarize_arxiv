    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is a powerful tool for the deterministic control of atom - photon interactions at the quantum level . in fact",
    ", the strong confinement allows to achieve the strong coupling regime where single quanta can profoundly affect the atom - cavity dynamics @xcite .",
    "many experiments have now reached this regime and interesting phenomena have been demonstrated , as a quantum phase gate @xcite , the fock state generation in a cavity field @xcite , and quantum nondemolition detection of a single cavity photon @xcite .",
    "moreover , cavity qed offers unique advantages for quantum communication and quantum information processing applications .",
    "in fact , atoms may act as quantum memories , while photons are flexible transporters of quantum information , and quantum networks of multiple atom - cavity systems linked by optical interconnects have been already discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the primary technical challenge on the road toward these applications is to trap individual neutral atoms within a high - finesse cavity for a reasonably long time .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have already succeeded in trapping single atoms inside an optical cavity driven at the few photon level , just using the strong coupling with the cavity qed mode for both cooling and trapping . however , the scheme of refs .",
    "@xcite is not entirely suitable for quantum communication purposes because it has limited operation flexibility and provides short trapping times ( order of hundreds of microseconds ) .",
    "in fact , it employs a single cavity mode , while it is preferable to have an additional trapping mechanism which does not interfere with the cavity qed interactions able to provide the atom - photon entanglement needed for the manipulation of quantum information . with these respect ,",
    "another experiment has already demonstrated significant trapping times ( @xmath0 ms ) of single cs atoms within a cavity , employing an additional far - off resonance trapping ( fort ) mode @xcite . using the fact that , in the strong coupling regime , the trajectory of an individual atom can be monitored in real time by the quasi - resonant cavity qed field @xcite , the fort beam can be turned on as soon as the atom enters the cavity in order to increase its trapping time .",
    "several mechanisms for cooling inside an optical resonator have been already discussed in the literature @xcite , involving either cavity mode driving , or direct atom driving via a classical laser field from the side , or even active feedback on atomic motion as in @xcite . however , only the recent paper by van enk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has discussed in detail the effects of an additional fort beam on the cooling and trapping dynamics and its interplay with the quasi - resonant cavity qed field . here",
    "we shall consider a situation analogous to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , even though we shall extend our study to new fort mode configurations .",
    "we have chosen a parameter region corresponding to the weak driving limit , with an empty - cavity mean photon number @xmath1 .",
    "we have performed full 3-d numerical simulations of the quasi - classical atomic motion , including the effects of spontaneous emission and dipole - force fluctuations .    in two - level systems ,",
    "red - detuned fort beams shift the atomic excited state @xmath2 the physical problem --------------------",
    "we consider a two level atom coupled to a quantized cavity mode and to an additional classical red - detuned fort beam , coinciding with another longitudinal mode of the cavity , with a wavelength @xmath3 longer than that of the quasi - resonant cavity mode , @xmath4 .",
    "the common situation is to consider lowest order gaussian modes for both fields @xcite , having their maximum intensity along the cavity axis .",
    "here we shall consider a different situation , where the fort mode is a higher - order gauss - laguerre mode , the so - called doughnut mode , having its maximum intensity at a nonzero radial distance from the cavity axis .",
    "this means that the atoms are trapped out of the cavity axis ( see fig .",
    "[ appa ] for a schematic description of the system ) . at first sight",
    ", this choice may look not optimal , because in this case the coupling with the fundamental gaussian cavity qed field responsible for cooling is smaller .",
    "nonetheless , we shall see that this choice is convenient in the case when the classical fort mode shifts _ down _ both excited and ground state , which is the most interesting case for quantum information processing applications .",
    "we recall that the laguerre - gauss modes lg@xmath5 are the solutions of the paraxial helmoltz equation in cylindrical coordinates @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the doughnut modes with radial index @xmath7 and azimuthal index @xmath8 , whose intensity is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the power , @xmath11 the wavenumber , and @xmath12 the beam radius .",
    "the doughnut mode radius is given by the position of the radial maximum , given by @xmath13 .",
    "we can simplify the description assuming a nearly planar cavity , so that @xmath14 .",
    "the classical , red - detuned fort mode induces ac stark shifts @xmath15 on the ground state @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the excited state @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we can distinguish two different situations : ( a ) @xmath16 is shifted down and @xmath18 is shifted up , which happens in the common situation where only the @xmath19 transition is close to the red detuned fort mode . in this case the two shifts are opposite .",
    "( b ) both @xmath16 and @xmath18 are shifted down , which happens when latexmath:[$%    than with the level @xmath16 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we shall study both situations and in case ( b ) we shall assume that the various detunings can be chosen so that the two levels are shifted down by the same quantity . furthermore , to simplify the comparison between the two cases , we shall assume that the two situations occur with the same wavelength @xmath21 .    considering a frame rotating at the probe driving frequency @xmath22 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the detuning of the the atomic resonance from the probe frequency , @xmath25 is the detuning of the cavity qed mode with annihilation operator @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the cavity driving rate , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the position and momentum vector operators of the atom , having a mass @xmath31 .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath32 describes the interaction between the internal atomic levels , the cavity modes and the atomic center - of - mass motion , and it is given by the coupling with the quantized cavity mode and with the fort doughnut mode . making the usual dipole and rotating wave approximations",
    ", this interaction term can be written @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the space - dependent rabi frequency due to the coupling with the quantized mode , and the second term @xmath35 describes the effect of the stark shifts induced by the fort mode , assuming the following form in the two cases , ( a ) and ( b ) : @xmath36 the frequency ac - stark shift is generally given by @xmath37 @xcite , where @xmath38 is the atomic polarizability and @xmath39 is the fort intensity of eq .",

    "we have generally considered different waists @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the two modes , but they practically coincide in typical situations .",
    "the fort mode provides the main trapping mechanism .",
    "this means that the atom will be trapped around the anti - nodes of the red - detuned fort field , because @xmath44 and the cavity qed field is weakly driven .",
    "however , due to the different wavelengths , one does not have a periodic situation , and the atom feels a different cavity qed coupling in different wells .",
    "in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite the cavity length @xmath45 is such that @xmath46 . to simplify our simulation",
    "we have however chosen @xmath47 , as it has been done also in @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "dissipation , diffusion and all non - conservative effects appear due to spontaneous emission and cavity losses .",
    "the quantum evolution of the atom - cavity system is therefore described by a master - equation for the atom - cavity density operator @xmath51 @xcite @xmath52 + \\kappa\\left ( 2a\\rho a^{\\dagger}-a^{\\dagger}a\\rho-\\rho a^{\\dagger}a\\right ) -\\gamma\\left",

    "relevant for current experiments , this dynamics is much faster than the atomic motional dynamics , especially for heavy atoms as cs @xcite or rb @xcite .",
    "therefore , internal and cavity dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated in order to obtain a reduced effective evolution equation for the motional degrees of freedom only .",
    "this adiabatic elimination can be made in a systematic way by adapting the general approach developed for free space cooling situations in ref .",
    "@xcite to the present cavity scheme ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one starts from the evolution equation of the wigner operator obtained by performing the wigner transform only on the motional hilbert space , and writing this equation as a taylor expansion in terms of two small parameters of the problem .",
    "denoting with @xmath62 the typical wavenumber of the problem , we have that one small parameter is @xmath63 showing that the motional state is characterized by a momentum spread @xmath64 much larger than the momentum kicks felt by the atom during any photon emission or absorption .",
    "the second small parameter is @xmath65 which instead shows that the doppler shift associated with the momentum spread is small with respect to the atomic and cavity linewidths .",
    "the two conditions set a lower and an upper bound for the momentum spread of the atom , which , thanks to the heisenberg inequality , put also a lower and an upper bound for its position spread .",
    "these bounds allow to describe the atomic motion in classical terms , because the atom is sufficiently localized in phase space to make it possible to describe its motion in terms of trajectories , while at the same time the phase space spread always remains larger than @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the crucial point is that the two conditions ( [ eps1 ] ) and [ eps2 ] ) must be consistent and this happens when @xmath67 this means supplementing the well known necessary condition for laser cooling in free space , @xmath68 ( the atom has to be still in resonance after spontaneously emitting ) @xcite , with an analogous condition for the exchange of cavity photons .    for small parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the atomic motion is much slower than the internal one , and the adiabatic elimination of the latter is obtained if the atomic kinetic energy term is neglected in the equation for the wigner operator , which then effectively factorizes into a product of a stationary state @xmath71 for the cavity and internal degrees of freedom evaluated at the fixed atomic position @xmath72 , and a real - valued motional wigner function @xmath73 . the stationary state @xmath71 satisfies the steady - state bloch equation @xmath74",

    "this is the most relevant result of our investigation , showing that using a doughnut mode as fort mode allows to achieve significant trapping times in the case ( b ) , when the fort induces equal stark shifts on the atomic levels .",
    "in fact , we get a mean trapping time larger than that obtained , in the same situation , with a red - detuned fundamental gaussian mode ( see the numerical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , section ivf , where @xmath194 ms ) .",
    "this shows that , in the case of equal stark shifts , the radial confinement at a nonzero distance from the cavity axis provided by the doughnut fort mode is preferable with respect to the radial trapping along the cavity axis provided by the tem@xmath195 fort mode .",
    "the improvement provided by doughnut mode is useful for quantum information processing applications in cavity qed systems , because when the fort mode induces equal shifts on the ground and excited state , the two states are trapped at the same positions within the cavity , and the internal state can be manipulated independently of its center - of - mass state . in quantum information applications , it is important to evaluate the variation of the cavity - qed coupling @xmath196 . in our parameters regime",
    "it is @xmath197 , which is worser than that for a tem@xmath195 fort mode under the same conditions ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "however the problem associated with such a variation of the coupling can be circumvented if one adopts an adiabatic transfer scheme such as the one suggested in @xcite for quantum information processing with hot trapped atoms .",
    "in such a case , the operation time @xmath199 for the adiabatic transformations must satisfy the conditions @xmath200 , where @xmath201 are the axial or radial oscillation frequencies .    an interesting alternative to the configuration studied here is to replace the tem@xmath195 cavity qed mode with the higher order lg@xmath202 cavity qed mode , having the same coupling @xmath203 at @xmath164 . in this way",
    "we achieve a better overlap between the fort mode and cavity qed one , which leads to a smaller variation of coupling @xmath204 , and therefore also to a better cooling configuration .",
    "in fact , repeating the simulations with the lg@xmath202 cavity qed mode we have seen a slight improvement of the trapping time .",
    "it is clear that the additional practical difficulty of using another lg mode makes the experimental realization even harder ; however this should be very challenging since , extending the configuration from one lg cavity - qed mode to many degenerate lg cavity - qed modes , one has new possibilities , as following atomic motion in detail @xcite , or increasing the cooling effect as shown in @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss in detail which are the main features of using red - detuned doughnut modes as fort fields .",
    "the atom - cavity dressed picture provides an intuitive way to understand the advantages brought by the use of the doughnut mode . in the present case of very weak driving ( @xmath205 in our case ) , the cooling mechanism is well described in terms of the eigenstates of the atom - cavity system ( the dressed states ) containing at most one excitation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the state with no excitation is the ground state @xmath206 , with energy @xmath207 , while the first two dressed states with one excitation @xmath208 so that the transition frequencies ( relative to @xmath209 ) from the ground state @xmath210 to excited states @xmath211 have the expressions @xmath212 the spatial variation of these transition frequencies along the axial direction ( and at the radial position @xmath213 ) is shown in fig .  [ transia ] for the case (",
    "a ) of opposite stark shifts , and in fig .",
    "[ transib ] for the case ( b ) of equal stark shifts .",
    "the patterns of spatial variation of the transition frequency allow to understand the difference between cases ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the cooling mechanism provided by the cavity qed interaction in the weak driving limit , can be understood in analogy with doppler cooling .",
    "in fact , by tuning below resonance , stimulated absorption of a probe photon followed by spontaneous emission or cavity decay leads to a loss of energy .",
    "the maximum cooling rate is achieved when the excitation rate times the detuning is maximum .",
    "if the detuning turns from red to blue , cooling is replaced by heating , while if the detuning becomes more red , the atom is still cooled , but at a lower rate . in case ( a ) ( fig .",
    "[ transia ] ) , it is better to tune the probe to the lower dressed state because it has smaller spatial variations ( see the straight line in fig .",
    "[ transia ] ) and it is easier to reach a compromise between having cavity regions with an optimal cooling rate ( red detuning ) and not too large regions with heating ( blue detuning ) .",
    "however , as the atom moves radially from the doughnut intensity maximum at @xmath213 , the situation rapidly worsens , either if the atom moves towards the center ( the fort beam decreases while the quantized field increase and the blue detuned region increases ) or if tends to leave the cavity ( the detuning becomes more red and the cooling rate decreases ) .    in case",
    "( b ) , one tunes again to the lowest dressed state in order to have red detuning , and therefore cooling , throughout the cavity , when the atom is at the radial equilibrium position @xmath214 ( see the straight line in fig .  [ transib ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ transition - freq ] ) we see that the probe detuning decreases ( becomes less red ) when the atom moves radially towards the center , while it becomes more red if the atom moves away radially .",
    "however , the probe detuning can be chosen so to remain always red : in this way the atom is cooled everywhere , and is never accelerated .",
    "for this reason the doughnut fort mode provides longer trapping times in case ( b ) of equal stark shifts rather than in case ( a ) of opposite shifts .",
    "what is more important is that , in case ( b ) , the doughnut fort mode provides longer trapping times than a fundamental gaussian fort mode ( see @xcite , section ivf ) .",
    "in fact , in the latter case , the probe detuning would be tuned so to have optimal cooling on the cavity axis , where the atoms will be now trapped .",
    "however , because of radial diffusion ( due to spontaneous emission ) which also leads to an increasing angular momentum and the consequent rising of a centrifugal potential , the atom tends to move radially away from the cavity axis , so that the optimal cooling condition is rapidly lost .",
    "in fact , for increasing @xmath215 , the axial pattern of fig .  [ transib ] rapidly vanishes , the driving probe becomes too far - off resonance and the cooling efficiency is lost .",
    "the advantage of the doughnut fort with respect to the tem@xmath195 fort is that it imposes a much sharper radial well around the equilibrium position corresponding to the optimum cooling condition .",
    "the atom is less free to move radially , and moreover is subject to a smaller centrifugal force because it is trapped by the doughnut at a larger radial distance from the cavity axis . in other words ,",
    "the radial potential well provided by the doughnut fort mode is more suitable to counteract the radial departure of the atom and so to preserve the optimal cooling condition .",
    "the importance of a strong radial confinement to optimize cooling and trapping in the case of equal stark shifts can be illustrated also checking that when the width of the radial well is decreased , the trapping time increases .",
    "to this purpose , we have carried out a simulation where a higher order laguerre - gauss fort mode , lg@xmath216 , is used instead of the lg@xmath217 fort mode , keeping the other conditions unchanged . to be more specific ,",
    "we have considered the same experimental parameters of the case with the lg@xmath218 fort mode in case ( b ) , in such a way that the lg@xmath216 mode gives the same stark shift @xmath219 mhz at the same radial distance @xmath220 @xmath221 .",
    "this means adapting both the incident fort power and the doughnut mode waist , so that the only difference with the case studied in the preceding section is the smaller width of the radial well ( see fig .",
    "[ compa1 - 12 ] , where the radial profile of the stark shift induced by the lg@xmath216 fort mode is compared with that of the lg@xmath218 mode ) .",
    "the chosen parameters are the same as above except that now the spatial dependence of the stark shift ( equal for both ground and excited state ) is @xmath222 with @xmath223 @xmath167 m and @xmath224 mhz@xmath225m@xmath226 .",
    "considering again the initial conditions specified in section [ cond_media ] and sampling about 400 simulated trajectories , we have found the results shown in figs .",
    "[ vtb12 ] and [ ptb12 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ vtb12 ] we have displayed the root mean square velocity along the cavity axis @xmath174 as a function of trapping time @xmath171 for each simulated trajectory .",
    "all atoms are again trapped , with trapping times greater than @xmath191 ms . the probability @xmath182 to be trapped for a time greater than @xmath183 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ ptb12 ] ) is computed considering all simulated points .",
    "the data are again fitted by a decaying fitting function @xmath192 ( full line in fig .",
    "[ ptb12 ] ) , yielding a mean lifetime @xmath227 ms .",
    "this significant improvement in the mean trapping time , provided by the lg@xmath228 fort mode with respect to the lg@xmath202 one , is due to the strongest radial confinement achieved ( see fig .  [ compa1 - 12 ] ) .",
    "the atom stays closer to the radial potential minimum where cooling conditions are optimized and the probability to leave the cavity decreases .",
    "this is a further argument showing that the main advantage of using a doughnut fort mode instead of a tem@xmath195 fort mode for atom trapping in the case of equal stark shifts is just the stronger radial confinement which makes easier to optimize the cooling conditions .",
    "the more the atom is radially confined , the longer is trapped .",
    "here we have decreased the width of the radial well by choosing a higher order doughnut mode and by simultaneously adjusting its waist , so to have an unchanged radial equilibrium position @xmath229 .",
    "this solution may be practically difficult to implement because one would need different cavity mirrors for this high - order doughnut fort mode .",
    "anyway , even though the implementation of the trapping scheme with a higher - order doughnut mode is difficult , the latter numerical results clearly show the importance of the radial confinement , and the direction one has to follow in order to increase the trapping time of neutral atoms in cavities in the case of equal stark shifts induced by the fort mode .    a possible solution to overcome the practical difficulties of a lg@xmath216 experimental set - up can be the following one , provided that one has enough power and stability for the laser driving the fort mode .",
    "the same radial potential around @xmath164 as that created by the lg@xmath216 fort mode can be achieved using a very intense lg@xmath202 fort mode .",
    "one can take @xmath230 mhz/@xmath130m@xmath231 , leading to @xmath232 mhz , and leave all the other parameters unchanged ( see iv.b for the parameters of the lg@xmath202 fort mode in case ( b ) ) . in this new configuration ,",
    "both the radial and the axial wells are 8 times deeper , and therefore , together with the desired strong radial confinement ( substantially the same as that of lg@xmath216 fort mode ) , we have a strong axial confinement .",
    "both these facts lead to a considerable increase of trapping time , up to @xmath177 seconds ( a result of the same order as the one recently reported in @xcite ) , as demonstrated by the numerical simulation of some trajectories which we show in the following table : @xmath233 according to table ( [ table1 ] ) , the atom is so strongly confined axially that in some cases ( those with the longer trapping times ) , it leaves the cavity radially , due to the effect of spontaneous emission . in these cases , an additional radial cooling mechanism would be helpful as , for instance , that achieved via an additional transverse free - space cooling ( see @xcite ) or via an active feedback on radial motion @xcite .",
    "we have investigated trapping of single atoms in high finesse optical cavities using both a quasi - resonant cavity qed field and an intense classical fort mode .",
    "in particular we have considered the case of doughnut fort modes , and we have compared them to the most common case of a fundamental gaussian fort mode ( see for example the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . performing full 3-d numerical simulations of the quasi - classical center - of - mass motion of the atom",
    ", we have shown that a doughnut fort mode is more suitable than a fundamental gaussian fort mode to trap the atom , in the case when the fort mode shifts both the excited and the ground state down .",
    "this happens when the fort mode is red - detuned in such a way that the excited state is relatively closer to resonance with a higher - lying excited state than with the ground state .",
    "this case , even though more difficult to realize than the standard two - level case where the two stark shifts are opposite , is of particular interest for quantum information applications of cavity - qed systems , where it is important to trap the atom at a given position , independently of its internal state , so that the quantum manipulation of the internal state can be easily performed .",
    "the advantage of using a doughnut fort mode instead of a tem@xmath195 one is due to the stronger radial confinement , achieved at a nonzero distance from the cavity axis . in this way",
    "the fort mode is more suitable to counteract the unavoidable radial departure caused by the centrifugal potential and by diffusion , by keeping the atom close to its equilibrium position where the cooling provided by the quantized cavity mode is optimal .",
