    "in high density environments , substellar companions leave their orbital imprints through the gravitational interaction with the surrounding circumstellar medium .",
    "an example is the observation of molecular spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk of ab aurigae @xcite , which is considered as evidence of a giant planet within the disk @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that a spiral wave sets up in the differentially rotating system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) during the formation and growth of a planet .",
    "this protoplanetary phase lasts for a few million years and is followed by a main sequence phase , in which the circumstellar disk dissipates and the planet - disk interaction ceases .",
    "planets or brown dwarfs orbiting low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) may have another opportunity to interact with their immediate surroundings before the stars terminate their evolution as white dwarf remnants .",
    "stars that have evolved off the main sequence , especially on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , expel a large fraction of their mass at rates @xmath5@xmath4yr@xmath6 , forming extensive ( @xmath7 cm ) cool ( @xmath8k ) low velocity ( @xmath9kms@xmath6 ) outflowing envelopes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "such intense mass loss rates imply an envelope density of @xmath10 @xmath11@xmath12 at 100au distance from the stellar center , which is slightly lower than the typical density of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "similar to the protoplanetary case , substellar mass objects that are embedded in the dense circumstellar envelopes of evolved giant stars will interact with the environment , playing a role in shaping the wind structure and also affecting the orbital evolution of the system .",
    "recently , the circumstellar envelopes of a few agb stars have been found to possess spiral morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite for afgl 3068 ; @xcite for cit 6 ) .",
    "such structures can not be explained by the spherically symmetric wind models for isolated stars with either continued ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , direct comparison with the detailed observational aspects remains as they likely involve the nonlinear process of dust formation in the envelopes . on the other hand , the spirals and greatly distended shells / arcs are more naturally produced by dynamical effects arising from a binary interaction in the expanding wind of the mass losing agb star @xcite .",
    "the binary - induced spiral model is supported by the detection of two point sources within the amazingly well - defined spiral envelope of afgl 3068 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , albeit initiated from a different viewpoint , a very similar spiral - onion shell structure in three dimensional space was described by @xcite .",
    "this study may help facilitate an understanding of asymmetric morphologies in circumstellar envelopes for cases of companions with low masses , which are not sufficiently massive to displace the parent star due to orbital motion .",
    "their linear perturbation analysis for gravitationally induced density wakes of circularly orbiting objects was motivated by @xcite s @xcite purely analytical formalism of the density wakes for linear orbit objects .",
    "follow up studies were carried out for binaries @xcite , for heavy objects showing nonlinear aspects @xcite , and for objects in accelerated motion @xcite .",
    "@xcite noticed that the local features of the nonlinear density wake are conceptually the same as those of a bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion column ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and are insensitive to the surface condition of the object .",
    "we note that the above theoretical works are based on an initially static uniform medium , which differs from the expanding agb envelopes .",
    "however , their results deserve to be examined in the extreme limit of a slow wind .",
    "the focus of these works was on the orbital evolution of the perturbing object due to dynamical friction , leaving the details of the wake itself in abeyance . in a separate paper the properties of the wake induced by a circularly orbiting object at distance @xmath13 with the orbital mach number @xmath14 ( @xmath151 ) in a static uniform background was investigated . here",

    "it is also concentrated to a greater extent toward the orbital plane showing a correlation with both wind and object mach numbers , @xmath70 and @xmath14 . in this section , we elucidate the details of the shape and morphology of the wake pattern in the outflowing circumstance , and determine the arm - interarm density contrast and its dependence on the wind and object properties .      the shape of the wake is highly affected by the background flow when formed by the gravitational interaction of the orbiting object with the background medium . in particular , the wake in the wind of an agb star forms a loosely wound spiral in the orbital plane in contrast to the case of a static medium .",
    "the shape of the spiral is determined by the ratio between the pattern propagation speed @xmath71 and the orbital speed of the perturbing object @xmath54 ( see ) , @xmath72 which reproduces @xmath73 in @xcite when the wind is absent . in figure",

    "the change of the spiral shapes due to the different wind velocities is highlighted by the dashed line showing the opening angle of the spiral in a static medium .",
    "this line matches the spiral shape in the vicinity of the object in figure  [ fig : comp]a , while the spirals open further with higher wind speeds as displayed in figure  [ fig : comp]b  c .",
    "this suggests that , in the presence of wind , the propagation speed of the spiral pattern in the radial direction , @xmath71 , is faster than the sonic speed of the medium .    for a linear perturbation analysis",
    ", we assume that the wind velocity @xmath61 is radial and constant in the entire region ( see  [ sec : back ] for the background wind conditions applied in numerical simulations ) . combining equations ( [ equ : cont])([equ : mome ] ) in the linearized versions for the perturbed velocity @xmath51 under the background conditions satisfying equations ( [ equ : conw])([equ : momw ] ) , we obtain @xmath74    = -\\frac{d}{dt}{\\vec{\\mathbf{\\nabla}}}\\phi_p\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the time derivative in the frame moving with the _ local _ background wind . due to the external gravity on the right hand side of the equation , the perturbed gas forms a single - armed spiral - like structure , similar to one in the static background analyzed in detail by . using spherical harmonics for the perturbation ,",
    "in general , in the form of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a slowly varying function of radius , we can write @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are defined as @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , respectively . in the wkb approximation ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) , the dispersion relation yields @xmath89 , indicating that the propagation speed of the pattern is @xmath90 at large distances , where @xmath61 and @xmath28 are _ local _ quantities .    in order to check @xmath71 in the numerical simulations , a density map is displayed in figure  [ fig : patt]a for the pattern in polar coordinates ( @xmath91 ) in which the slope of the high density arm boundaries represents the velocity ratio @xmath92 .",
    "numerical differentiation along the high density boundary indeed gives the propagation speed of @xmath93 for the outer boundary and @xmath94 for the inner boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : patt]b ) , depending on the _ local _ wind properties and not on the background wind type .",
    "this result implies that in the warm central region where the thermal sound speed is relatively large , the shape of spiral must take account of the sound speed as well as the expansion speed of the envelope .",
    "the spacing of the arm is not necessarily constant , but varies especially in the wind acceleration zone and in slow wind envelopes . in figure",
    "[ fig : patt]a , the outer boundary reaches @xmath95 and 4.3 after the first and second turns ( see also vertical dotted lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : patt]b ) thus the arm spacing increases by 15% ( from @xmath96 to 2.3 ) .",
    "for the inner boundary , the locations of @xmath97 , 0.5 , 1.2 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.2 , and 5.4 indicate @xmath98 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.1 , and 1.2 for the respective turns .",
    "that is , the arm spacing changes significantly at the first a few turns , where the wind velocity varies considerably in this model , and the increase rate reaches to 140% at the sixth turn relative to the arm spacing at the first turn .    of particular importance is the overlap of the inner and outer arm boundaries seen in figure  [ fig : patt]a at @xmath99 , 3.0 , and 5.1 . in outflowing envelopes the outer and inner boundaries propagate at different speeds ( by @xmath100 ) , causing overlaps , unlike the unique propagation speed @xmath28 in a static background ( ) .",
    "thus the detailed structure of the spiral in the outflowing envelope can be more complicated than in a static background .",
    "the difference in propagation speeds results in the overlap of boundaries at resonant positions @xmath101 given by the integration of equation ( [ equ : patt ] ) as @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 , assuming that the pattern propagation speed does not change significantly .",
    "hence , the overlap occurs every @xmath105 derived as @xmath106 consistent with the intervals between overlays in figure  [ fig : patt]a .",
    "we should also notice the presence of spiral structures in the cases of subsonic objects ( sfx and ssx models ) .",
    "in a static background medium , an object with a subsonic orbital speed ( @xmath107 ) induces the wake to be in a smooth distribution rather than confined within a spiral arm @xcite .",
    "however , in an outflowing environment , the background wind sweeps and compresses the induced wake material , resulting in a spiral arm shape , as in the cases for supersonic motion .      figure  [ fig : prf1]a exhibits the density enhancement factor for model a1 . in order to trace the full structure of the spiral",
    ", we plot the profiles along eight different directions in the orbital plane with different colored lines .",
    "one noticeable difference from the corresponding profiles in a static background is the level of the zero baseline of the perturbed density . without a wind",
    ", the wake always has minimum density with the central value of @xmath108 forming a hydrodynamic equilibrium ( see  for details ) .",
    "however , in the outflowing medium , this global increase of background density is suppressed since the material is swept out of the central part by the wind before its pressure balances the gravitational potential at the central part .",
    "this wind sweeping effect also precludes the wake from developing the nonlinear features described by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : prf1]a , the peak values of the density enhancement decrease with distance as outlined by a solid line ( see below ) .",
    "this is approximated by a dashed line , @xmath109 , with the power law index of 0.5 except for the steeper profile in the innermost part .    in order to explore the dependence of the density enhancement @xmath110 on the properties of object and envelope , we compare in figure  [ fig : prf1 ] the profiles of @xmath110 along distances in the orbital plane for the a models .",
    "compared to the fiducial model ( a1 ) , we investigate the effects of the stellar mass loss rate @xmath111 ( a2 ) , the size of the star @xmath46 defined by the numerical reset radius ( a3 ) , the gravitational softening radius of the perturbing object @xmath60 ( a4 ) , the mass of the object @xmath1 as well as the sound speed of the background gaseous medium @xmath28 ( a5 ) , and the orbital radius of the object @xmath13 ( a6 ) . by comparing model a1 with models a2 and a3",

    "the independence of density enhancement on the mass loss rate is a natural consequence for an isothermal gas . reducing the gravitational softening radius @xmath60 of the perturbing object by an order of magnitude from @xmath112 ( a1 ) to @xmath113 ( a4 ) sharpens the density profiles to some extent but insignificantly changes the overall features .",
    "the identity of density profiles in the models a4 and a5 indicates that the density enhancement @xmath110 depends merely on the bondi accretion radius @xmath114 , and not on the object mass @xmath1 or the sound speed @xmath28 individually ; it is also checked that @xmath110 is proportional to @xmath1 and @xmath115 using models a5 - 1 and a5 - 2 , respectively . for model a6 , the perturbing object",
    "is located at a distance twice as large from the central star than the orbital distance in the other a models , resulting in a similar value of @xmath110 at large distances @xmath116 although the width and interval of the spiral have increased with the larger orbital radius @xmath13 .    in figure",

    "these pattern propagation speeds yield the wake shape in the orbital plane , @xmath142 for the outer and inner boundaries , respectively , constituting archimedes spiral shapes .",
    "if we define the arm spacing @xmath143 as the interval of the outer or inner boundary individually , the spiral shapes of boundaries simply yield @xmath144 assuming that the pattern propagation speed does not significantly vary within one turn .",
    "one can estimate the orbital period , @xmath145 , by measuring the observed arm spacing in addition to the wind and sound speeds .",
    "alternatively , this is written by @xmath146 from which we can predict the orbital distance @xmath13 of the substellar object in the case that the stellar mass @xmath147 is known .",
    "we note that the sound speed should be taken into account especially in a slow wind ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the outer arm boundary propagates at a higher speed than the inner boundary by @xmath100 , leading to the broadening of the arm as a function of radial distance .",
    "thus , these high density boundaries overlap each other and are in resonance at the overlap positions , @xmath117 . assuming a constant wind and sonic speeds , the spacings of these resonant positions is derived to be @xmath149 ( see eqs.[[equ : over ] ] and [ [ equ : del1 ] ] ) . in cool agb envelopes , the wind is usually much faster than the sound speed ( @xmath150 ) , making @xmath105 relatively large .",
    "for instance , with @xmath151 , which is easily found for agb stars , the outer and inner arm boundaries can meet only after five turns .",
    "for the case of an observational detection of only parts of the spiral , especially when the partial spiral is expected over the distance of @xmath105 , a more careful analysis is required to avoid misidentifying the outer and inner boundaries .    we have also provided an empirical formula ( eq .  [ [ equ : jump ] ] ) for the arm - interarm density contrast , @xmath68 , along a normalized distance @xmath152 as a function of @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 . using this empirical formula",
    ", we estimate the properties of a jupiter wake in the stellar wind when our sun becomes a giant of size 1au ( @xmath156@xmath4 , @xmath157@xmath4yr@xmath6 , @xmath158 ; according to @xcite ) .",
    "the wind speed @xmath61 is set to be @xmath13310kms@xmath6  based on the trend between the mass - loss rate and the envelope expansion speed ( see fig .",
    "16 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the sonic speed @xmath28 is assumed to be 1kms@xmath6 .",
    "the estimated orbital speed @xmath159 of jupiter in situ ( @xmath160au ) is 12kms@xmath6 , corresponding to the arm - interarm density contrast of only 7% of the background density at distance of 100au .",
    "the density contrast does not significantly depend on the orbital distance , i.e. , 611% for @xmath16130au .",
    "thus , it is difficult to detect the gravitational wake of a jupiter mass object with the current observational limitations of sensitivity and angular resolution . in the same range of orbital distance",
    ", a 10 jupiter mass object can create a gravitational wake with the density contrast of 3044% at 100au ; and for a brown dwarf mass ( 0.07@xmath4 ) , the contrast increases to 160220% , which may be detectable with the high sensitivity performance of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "we note that these numerical values are lower limits since the peak density contrast at the arm boundary can be higher with a realistic size of the object much smaller than @xmath162au employed in this study ; but the effect of the object size @xmath60 is not significant unless the size is comparable to the accretion radius @xmath20 . the required spatial resolution to distinguish",
    "the arm pattern separation is 12370au depending on the orbital distance ( @xmath16130au ) . on a larger scale ,",
    "a distance corresponding to 5 times this arm separation ( in this case of @xmath163 ) is the distance between overlaps showing a higher density contrast by a factor of 2 .",
    "the case for fast winds compared to the sonic and object speeds is the most relevant case for many observed agb envelopes ( @xmath164  10kms@xmath6 ) . for a substellar object orbiting at a distance , @xmath165 , the density contrast at large distance ( @xmath166 )",
    "can be simply written as @xmath167 from which the measurement of the density contrast provides the value of the bondi accretion radius @xmath65 ( or the object mass @xmath1 with a given sound speed ) for the structure at a known distance from the agb star . under the fast wind assumption",
    ", the density contrast shows a shallower decrease with distance , compared to its counterpart in an initially static background decreasing as @xmath168 ( ) . this shallow decrease in the density contrast facilitates observations at great distances from the star , which is favorable to avoid the high obscuration due to either the bright stellar glare or the dense central environment .",
    "equation ( [ equ : fast ] ) indicates that the density contrast between arm and interarm regions can be greater than @xmath169 for distances where @xmath170 assuming that we can distinguish a density fluctuation of 30% ( @xmath171 ) , the wake due to an object of mass @xmath1 would be observable in the central area within a distance of @xmath0au in the case of @xmath126kms@xmath6 .",
    "that is , we may expect to observe the wake of a @xmath172 mass planet within 100au with a sensitivity corresponding to a density contrast of 30% . alternatively , it may be necessary to take account of the density enhancement due to the planetary wakes when modeling the overall profile of circumstellar envelopes using observational data in which the wakes are not resolved .    in the regime",
    "for which the background wind is slower than the orbital velocity ( @xmath173 ) , corresponding to an object in a close orbit at @xmath174 , the peak density contrast at large distance ( @xmath166 ) is roughly proportional to the velocity ratio @xmath175 . in this regime ,",
    "the effect of the wind outflow in opening the spiral pattern competes with the object orbital motion tightening the pattern ( see eq .  [ [ equ : spir ] ] ) , causing a higher density jump at the more normal shock boundary to the instantaneous flow .",
    "although the analysis in this paper only treats a substellar mass object orbiting about the agb star fixed at the system center , our results can be extrapolated to the gravitational density wake of the companion in a stellar binary system .",
    "for instance in an agb envelope , characterized by a temperature of 100k ( @xmath126kms@xmath6 ) , a solar mass companion would produce a density fluctuation of a factor of 1.6 to 1.3 ( @xmath176@xmath177 from eq .",
    "[ [ equ : fast ] ] ) at distance of 3,00010,000au from the center of the mass losing star , where the spiral pattern is found in afgl 3068 @xcite .",
    "the density fluctuation from the companion s wake is smaller than that estimated from the scattered light observation ( the factor of up to @xmath178 ) , indicating that the spiral pattern of afgl 3068 is likely caused by the reflex motion of the agb star as suggested in @xcite , following earlier theoretical work , for example , by @xcite .",
    "however , in the central 1  region ( @xmath179 1,000au ) , where the density fluctuation due to the companion is larger , alma would possibly resolve a double spiral structure due to the individual stars . to compare the contribution of the two different mechanisms",
    ", we plan to study the density enhancement due to the reflex motion of the mass losing star , similar to the study here .",
    "the shapes of two spirals ( e.g. , pitch angle , arm spacing ) are expected to be same , because the spiral shape is determined by the local wind properties , @xmath61 and @xmath28 .",
    "but the spiral of the agb star is probably detached from the star because of the stellar outflow , contrary to the spiral of the companion attached to the object .",
    "our work suggests directions for future research .",
    "for example , a detailed study of the inner regions of the agb envelope is necessary to examine the effects of gas heating / cooling , dust anisotropic distribution , and possibly stellar pulsation on the properties of the spiral arm pattern .",
    "in addition , investigations of binary systems over a wider range of mass ratios should be examined to explore the modifications in the spiral / arc patterns in the regime where the effect of the reflex motion of the agb star is also important . finally ,",
    "radiative transfer modeling of the molecular line emission and dust continuum are encouraged in order to compare theoretical models with observed structures in detail .",
