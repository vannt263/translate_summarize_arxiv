    "\" the typical value of this potential is @xmath8 , while the de broglie wavelength , @xmath9 , of a ucn is more than @xmath4 . a ucn experiences a potential ( which represents the neutron - nucleus interaction spatially averaged over millions of nuclei ) having a form of a step function which takes a nonzero value within the space where the ucn wave function overlaps the potential .",
    "the incident wave - packets colliding with the averaged potential barrier that is higher than the kinetic energy of the neutron penetrate into the classically forbidden region and hence some ucns are scattered by nuclei inside the barrier , and then the wave - packets are almost fully reflected .",

    "the absolute value corresponds to @xmath13 at a magnetic flux density of @xmath14 .",
    "it means that polarized ucns with velocities less than @xmath15 can not overcome the magnetic field . as results of these features",
    ", ucns can be stored in a magnetic bottle or a vessel with an interior surface which has a high material potential , and therefore are useful for long - term storage experiments such as searches for the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm )  @xcite or measurement of neutron lifetime  @xcite .",
    "the non - zero nedm implies the breaking of time - reversal invariance and its magnitude limits the predictions of some new physics models beyond the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "the neutron lifetime determines the mass fraction of @xmath16he in the early universe and the improvement of the accuracy of the lifetime verifies the consistency between the fractions resulted from lifetime measurements and satellite surveys  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a ucn is useful probe in studies of a region far from the material surface , such as the behavior of the potential or the phonon dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "the most well - known ucn source is steyerl neutron turbine at institut laue - langevin ( ill )  @xcite .",
    "very cold neutrons ( vcns ) generated in the reactor are guided by a slightly curved vertical neutron guide and decelerated below @xmath17 by the gravitational field , while thermal neutrons are filtered out by the curved guide .",
    "the vcns are guided into a vacuum chamber in which a turbine with 690 cylindrically curved blades rotates with a blade velocity of @xmath18 .",
    "the blade surface is coated with ni and the neutrons are multiply reflected by the moving blades .",
    "finally , the vcns are decelerated below @xmath19 by the doppler effect .",
    "a neutron doppler shifter is a similar apparatus to the abovementioned turbine  @xcite . in this apparatus ,",
    "a small number of neutron mirrors move backwards at half the velocity of the target neutrons , and the neutrons are decelerated to the ucn region by a single reflection only .",
    "the doppler shifter is an effective device for decelerating pulsed neutrons with large velocity components in the guide direction .",
    "the simple mechanism allows us to estimate the ucn flux precisely by a particle tracking simulation . in the simplest case of the reflection from a rotating small flat reflector",
    ", there is a strong correlation between the velocities and recoil angles of decelerated neutrons .",
    "the neutrons have a short - pulse time structure and therefore are useful for a time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrometer  @xcite . by using a shutter beside the source point",
    "whose open and close operation is synchronized with ucn production , the doppler shifter can also be used for ucn storage experiments as if by using a steady source at the peak density of ucn  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first pulsed ucn source produced by a doppler shifter was reported by dombeck et al .",
    "@xcite ; this doppler shifter was equipped with a package of thermica crystals on the tip of a rotating arm and decelerated 400-@xmath0 neutrons .",
    "another doppler shifter has since been developed for research and development ( r@xmath20d ) at the bl05 nop beamline of the materials and life science experiment facility ( mlf ) at the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc )  @xcite .",
    "neutron supermirrors  @xcite were selected for the reflector of our doppler shifter because the reflectivity wavelength band is controllable freely .",
    "the peak phase space density of 136-@xmath0 vcn beam at j - parc ( in ref .",
    "@xcite ) was 31 times greater than that of the ucns at ill pf2 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , hence the production of extremely high density ucn was expected .",
    "the demonstration experiment of ucn production was carried out at a beam power of @xmath21 . as a result ,",
    "a ucn count of @xmath22 was expected for a forthcoming 1-mw beam operation  @xcite .",
    "the low count rate was due to a strong collimation of the injected vcns and a small solid angle of ucn extraction .",
    "we have proposed a nedm search with a spallation ucn source ( j - parc p33 )  @xcite . toward the realization of the plan",
    ", the doppler shifter was used for the r@xmath20d of an important apparatus for our nedm search , which we named  ucn rebuncher \"  @xcite .",
    "the ucn rebuncher is a neutron accelerator , which accelerates or decelerates pulsed ucns suitably with the combination between the gradient magnetic field  @xcite and the adiabatic fast passage spin flipper  @xcite , rotates the ucn distribution in velocity - position phase space and then time - focuses the ucns on any position .",
    "the ucn rebuncher is necessary to improve the storage density of ucn at the nedm experiment with the spallation source of low repetition frequency like j - parc . because of such a mechanism of time - focus , the pulsed ucn produced by the doppler shifter is suitable for the performance test of the ucn rebuncher . in the test ,",
    "ucns extracted from the doppler shifter were transported to a detector through ni - coated ucn guides passing through the ucn rebuncher .",
    "the focal length of the rebuncher was set to @xmath23 . in consideration of an arrangement of the rebuncher at bl05 ,",
    "glass guides with total length of @xmath24 were produced .",
    "as a result of a ucn transport experiment , the 1 mw - equivalent total count rate at the end of the ucn guide was @xmath25 due to the low transmittance of the guide , while that of the environmental background was @xmath26 . in a time - focus experiment ,",
    "unnecessary ucn pulses have to be interrupted by a synchronized shutter near the doppler shifter in order to prevent frame overlap of the tof and detect 34-m / s ucns . in that case the average flux of ucn is greatly thinned .",
    "therefore it was difficult to obtain the tof spectrum with the shutter within a practical time span . in order to perform the ucn rebuncher experiment at j - parc / mlf bl05 ,",
    "it was necessary to increase the peak flux of the ucn pulse at least 10 times .    in order to increase the ucn flux ,",
    "the incident vcns should be transported into the doppler shifter more efficiently .",
    "therefore , we have newly installed supermirror guides , wide - band monochromatic mirrors , and focus guides in the neutron beamline .",
    "further , the produced ucns should also be extracted without loss .",
    "thus , a ni - coated ucn extraction guide has been inserted into the doppler shifter .",
    "the outcomes of these upgrades have been evaluated at beampowers of 200@xmath27 . in this paper , we describe the details of the construction of our upgraded ucn source and its performance . at present , the improved ucn rebuncher has been developing .",
    "the performance test will be carried out by using the improved doppler shifter .",
    "in this section , we describe the principles of ucn production using a doppler shifter . as neutrons",
    "faster than ucns can be reflected by bragg scattering , multilayer - structured materials such as mica crystals or artificial supermirrors can be applied to the doppler shifter reflector .",
    "hereafter , we call the reflector a  doppler mirror \" .",
    "a neutron is reflected if it satisfies the bragg condition in the frame of the moving doppler mirror .",
    "the velocity vector , @xmath28 , of the reflected neutron in the laboratory frame is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the velocity vector of the incident neutron , @xmath31 is the velocity vector of the mirror surface at the reflection point of the neutron , and @xmath32 is the normal vector at the reflection point . in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the incident neutron receives a momentum stroke in the direction @xmath32 , as shown in equation ( [ equ01 ] ) the wavelength of the incident neutron is shifted to a shorter or longer value , as in the doppler effect of a sound wave .",
    "this is the reason why such devices are called doppler shifters .",
    "if @xmath31 is close to @xmath33 , the reflected neutron is decelerated close to zero velocity .",
    "the decelerated neutron is regarded as a ucn if the magnitude of @xmath28 is less than @xmath34 .",
    "thus , a mechanism that can move a mirror in the same direction as and at the half - speed of the incident neutron is required , in order to form a doppler shifter that decelerates an incident neutron to a ucn through a single reflection . in the apparatus described here",
    ", continuous motion of the mirror is realized using a rotating arm , where the mirror is attached to the arm tip .",
    "next , we formulate the velocity of the decelerated neutron .",
    "we define the beam direction as along the @xmath35-axis , the rotation axis of the arm is the @xmath36-axis , and the axis perpendicular to the @xmath36- and @xmath35-axes is the @xmath37-axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig001]a .",
    "the incident neutrons travel in the positive @xmath35 direction .",
    "the doppler mirror is positioned on the arm and the mirror surface is parallel to the @xmath36-axis and the direction of the arm .",
    "we define the point where the beam crosses the doppler mirror when the mirror surface comes to overlap the @xmath37-axis as the pseudo source point .",
    "then , the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath35 components of the velocity of a reflected neutron , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , respectively , are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the respective incident angles of the neutron in the @xmath36- and @xmath37-planes , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the magnitudes of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and @xmath46 is the rotation angle of the mirror against the @xmath37-axis . in these equations , we assume that @xmath45 is close to @xmath47 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath46 are small and ignore terms of order higher than the third order of their products .        in this case , the velocities of the decelerated neutrons are distributed on a parabola in the @xmath39-@xmath40 velocity space plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig001]b .",
    "then , @xmath40 is expressed as @xmath48    suppose that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the arm length is @xmath53 and , accordingly , the angular velocity of the rotation is @xmath54 .",
    "then , the condition for ucn production , @xmath55 , is expressed as @xmath56 , from equations ( [ equ03 ] ) and ( [ equ04 ] ) .",
    "the angular width of @xmath57 can be converted to a time width of @xmath58 .",
    "ucns are produced in the vicinity of the pseudo source point . as an increase of @xmath46 in @xmath39",
    "can be canceled by non - zero @xmath43 , as shown in equation ( [ equ03 ] ) , the actual width of @xmath46 for ucn production is wider for a divergent beam with a width of @xmath43 .",
    "the estimated results yielded by a 3d monte carlo simulation based on ray tracing and incorporating the geometry of our doppler shifter , which we refer to as the  ucn simulation \" in this paper , indicate that @xmath59 of the extractable ucns are produced within an angular width of @xmath60 from an incident vcn beam with velocity divergence within @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the time width of the extractable ucn production is @xmath62 .    as the produced ucns",
    "are extracted in the direction perpendicular to the orbit of the mirror , the time width of the produced ucn pulse is roughly identical to the mirror size .",
    "this means that the maximum time width of the ucn pulse with 6.0-@xmath0 velocity in the extraction direction is @xmath63 , for the sample case of extraction in the upper direction with a 30-mm high mirror .",
    "if ucns are extracted along the @xmath37-axis in the ucn simulation , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the ucn pulse time structure for a longitudinal velocity of approximately @xmath64 is @xmath65 at production , because of the incident beam divergence .",
    "the fwhm of the ucn pulse with a longitudinal velocity of more than @xmath66 is @xmath2",
    ". therefore , the doppler shifter with the design described above can generate sharply pulsed ucn of 4.4-ms width at production .",
    "at the j - parc mlf , pulsed proton beams are injected from the 3-gev rapid cycling synchrotron ring ( rcs ) to the mlf source .",
    "neutrons are then produced by spallation reactions and cooled by liquid hydrogen moderators .",
    "the repetition frequency of the neutron production is @xmath67 .",
    "the neutron production pauses for @xmath68 every 3 or 6 s , because proton beams are supplied to the 50-gev main ring ( mr ) when particle physics experiments in the neutrino experimental facility or the hadron experimental facility are being performed .    at the bl05 port",
    ", an incident neutron beam is transported by @xmath69 supermirror guides , where @xmath70 is the critical angle normalized to that of ni .",
    "the beam is then divided into three branches using supermirror bending guides : the polarized , unpolarized , and low - divergence beam branches , which have been discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "the doppler shifter is positioned on the unpolarized beam branch as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig002 ] , where the neutrons are guided upwards at @xmath71 by a @xmath72 arc - shaped supermirror bender of 100-m radius and 4.0-m length  @xcite .",

    "fast neutrons escape from the guide at the curve and only cold neutrons are transported .",
    "neutrons transported through the bender pass @xmath75 supermirror guides to reach the exit of the concrete shielding surrounding the apparatus .",
    "these guides have 4.2-@xmath76 length and the internal cross section is @xmath73 .",
    "the gap between the bender and guide is @xmath77 wide , and is designed to be as short as possible to transport vcn with large divergence .",
    "note that a b@xmath78c collimator was used instead of the supermirror guide tube when the demonstration experiment discussed in this paper was performed  @xcite .",
    "we measured the fluxes of the unpolarized branch with the supermirror guides or the b@xmath78c collimators in terms of wavelength distributions using a neutron beam monitor , mnh10/4.2f  @xcite , with a collimator of @xmath79 .",
    "the detector was mounted on the unpolarized branch exit at the 16.2-m position shown in fig .",
    "[ fig002 ] .",
    "the neutron pulse interval at mlf is usually @xmath80 , so neutrons with velocities less than @xmath81 can not normally be distinguished at the unpolarized branch .",
    "therefore , neutrons produced by the last beam pulse immediately before the beam supply to the mr were selected from the data to prevent frame overlap with slower neutrons , and the tofs from their production were then converted to the corresponding wavelengths .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig003 ] , which were calculated using detection efficiency compensation and normalized to the designed beampower of @xmath3 .",
    "it is possible to fit the flux data sets using a boltzmann distribution under certain conditions , where @xmath82 in this equation , @xmath83 is the flux distribution , @xmath84 is the total flux , @xmath85 is the planck constant , @xmath70 is the neutron mass , @xmath86 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath87 is the neutron temperature , @xmath88 is the attenuation coefficient ( such as absorption by the al windows ) , and @xmath89 is the neutron environmental background .",
    "this expression can be applied to cases where the neutron divergence is independent of wavelength , such that the neutrons are perfectly reflected or absorbed by a neutron guide or collimator .",
    "the flux is primarily restricted by the solid angle of the guide entrance or the collimator exit . in the case of bl05 ,",
    "the @xmath69 supermirror guides with incident angle less than the critical angle have more than @xmath90 reflectivity ; hence , this condition is roughly satisfied for low - divergence vcns .    in a divergence measurement with a 1-mm - diameter pinhole and a position - sensitive detector  @xcite ,",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath91- and @xmath92-divergence of vcns with wavelengths longer than @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) were found to be 50 and @xmath95 respectively , where the @xmath91- and @xmath92-axes were the horizontal and vertical directions on the plane parallel to the unpolarized branch window .",
    "the divergence of the @xmath96 vcns was within @xmath97 in each direction . because the critical velocity of the @xmath69 supermirror at zero incident angle is @xmath98 , a vcn with a glancing angle of @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) is perfectly reflected by the surface .",
    "accordingly , the flux attenuation for such a vcn is almost independent of its wavelength in the transport , excluding the case of neutron capture in al .",

    "the spatial volume was also overestimated because the ucn density in the volume was not uniform . in the ucn simulation , the number density of ucns in the 1-@xmath163 cube at the psuedo source point just after production was @xmath164 , while the average density in @xmath151-volume was @xmath165 .",
    "thus , the overestimations in the spatial and velocity volumes roughly explain the reduction of the phase space density of the ucns .    as the ucns produced by the doppler shifter",
    "have a position and velocity correlation , they are concentrated in a part of the phase space volume .",
    "as described in equation ( [ equ05 ] ) , the doppler - shifted neutrons are distributed on a line of @xmath166 in the @xmath37-@xmath40 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig014 ] , because of the difference of the rotating radius .",
    "therefore , if we take the phase space volume as a product of the spatial and velocity volume with which the ucns are produced , the effective phase space density becomes small .",
    "if we use a parallel moving doppler mirror , such as an excentric double motor  @xcite , or modify the ucn velocity with a magnetic accelerator system like the ucn rebuncher , we can obtain a ucn beam with smaller @xmath40 divergence .",
    "we have developed the proposed doppler shifter for the first ucn source at j - parc and significantly improved the ucn output by replacing or adding neutron optical components for practical use .",
    "the doppler - shifted neutrons have an 8.33-hz sharply pulsed time structure of 4.4-ms width .",
    "the @xmath3-equivalent neutron count rate for neutrons of longitudinal wavelength between 58 and @xmath167 is @xmath5 .",
    "the true ucn count rate is estimated to be @xmath6 , according to a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the ucn number density is estimated to be at least @xmath7 at production .",
    "the doppler shifter works almost as designed and produces sufficient ucn output for practical use .    through application of the doppler shifter ,",
    "we have already begun r & d of apparatus for use in our search for the nedm  @xcite .",
    "the result of the ucn transport experiment with the 5.6 m - long guide is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig015 ] , as an example .",
    "ucns were guided to the horizontal direction with an l - shape mirror guide connected to the 5.6 m - long guide .",
    "ucn count was reduced to @xmath168 in this section .",
    "the mean reflectivity of the 5.6 m - long guide was estimated to be @xmath169 .",
    "the 1 mw - equivalent total count rate increased to @xmath170 by the improvement of the doppler shifter and the ucn region was @xmath171 , although the ucn pulses were thinned to @xmath172 , @xmath173 , with the shutter .",
    "as the result of the improvement , the doppler shifter allows us to perform the ucn rebuncher experiment at bl05 in a practical time span . at present , we are planning the performance test of the improved ucn rebuncher with an experimental setup incorporating the ucn guides , along with the development of a ucn reflectometer and storage experiments .",
    "this research was partially supported by ministry of education , science , sports , and culture grants - in - aid for scientific research ( a ) 23244047 and ( a ) 26247035 , and by the jsps , grant no .",
    "the doppler shifter experiment was approved by the neutron scattering program advisory committee of imss , kek ( proposal no . 2009s03 and 2014s03 ) .",
    "the neutron reflectivity experiment was approved by the neutron science proposal review committee of j - parc / mlf ( proposal no . 2009s08 and 2014b0263 ) and supported by the inter - university research program on neutron scattering of imss , kek .",
