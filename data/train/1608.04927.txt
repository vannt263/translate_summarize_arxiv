    "almost forty years ago , it was realized by leinaas and myrheim that in two - dimensional systems , particles with statistics interpolating between bosonic and fermionic statistics are a possibility @xcite .",
    "it is wildly believed that particles of this type are realized in the fractional quantum hall systems @xcite , even though the anyonic statistics of the quasi - particles has not yet been probed directly .",
    "moore and read proposed fractional quantum hall states for which the quasi - particles have non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
    "it is believed that this moore  read",
    "state describes the @xmath1 quantum hall effect @xcite .",

    "read state .",
    "following the first theoretical proposal @xcite of how to realize kitaev s model , there are experimental indications that majorana bound states might be realized experimentally @xcite .    in @xcite , the effect of interactions between non - abelian anyons",
    "were studied by means of a one - dimensional model hamiltonian .",
    "non - abelian anyons , in particular so - called fibonacci anyons , are used as building blocks for this model hamiltonian in the same way as spins are used in model hamiltonians such as the heisenberg model in order to study magnetism . in @xcite",
    "many different types of anyon models have been introduced .",
    "generalizations of the original model include models with longer - range interactions @xcite .",
    "considering various geometries , such as ladders @xcite , as well as making use of different types of anyons@xcite have been investigated . in this paper",
    ", we consider a generalization of the dilute anyon model @xcite  a model in which anyons are allowed to hop to empty neighboring sites .",
    "the type of term we add to this model is a pairing term that creates or annihilates pairs of anyons on neighboring sites .",
    "the anyons we use are of the type @xmath0 , which is the same type as the excitations of the read ",
    "rezayi quantum hall states @xcite .",
    "the anyon model we study has a large number of parameters and , since the number of anyons is not considered to be fixed in our model , the size of the hilbert space grows quickly with system size .",
    "we therefore can not characterize the phase diagram of our model in full detail , but we concentrate ourselves on two particular cases . in the first case , we tune the model to a point where the hamiltonian becomes a sum of projectors .",
    "this allows us to determine the exact zero - energy ground states for the case when @xmath3 , in @xmath0 , is odd .",
    "in addition , we study the model at two integrable points where , in most cases , the model turns out to be critical .",
    "most of these critical points are described by minimal - model conformal field theories .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : anyon - theory ] , we introduce the notion of anyon models as the language we use to define our hamiltonian . in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the anyon model and its corresponding hilbert space and finally present the hamiltonian that we investigate in later sections . in section [ sec : exact - groundstates ] , we study the hamiltonian at a special point where we can determine the exact zero - energy ground states as well as the number of these states . in section [ sec : integrability ] , we determine for which values of the parameters the model is integrable and determine the behavior of the model at these integrable points . section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions . in appendix",

    "[ app : k1alternative ] , we map our model hamiltonian , in the case of @xmath5 , to a spin-1/2 hamiltonian .",
    "the mathematical framework that describes the anyons in a rigorous way is that of tensor categories .",
    "however , in this article we do not need this full machinery and we use a more concrete picture of anyons and anyon systems . we will be brief here and refer to @xcite for more elaborate introductions into the subject .",
    "we start introducing a finite set of _ labels _ , @xmath6 , that contains the labels of all the anyon types present in the anyon model we consider .",
    "we call these labels the anyon ` _ _ charges _ _ ' .",
    "one of the elements of the set is distinguished from the others and plays the role of the vacuum .",
    "we label this element by @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , with each label @xmath8 in the set , we associate another label in @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath10 , that represents the charge conjugate to @xmath8 .",
    "we call the anyon @xmath10 the _ dual _ to @xmath8 .",
    "the charge conjugate to the vacuum is the vacuum itself , that is , @xmath11 . for other anyons @xmath8 , the dual might or might not be the original anyon , but we always have @xmath12 . to define the notions of the vacuum and the dual anyon",
    ", we need to introduce the notion of _ fusion _ first .",
    "the fusion of anyons is analogous to combining different spin multiplets by means of the tensor product .",
    "thus , to specify the possible fusions , we need to specify what the possible ` fusion outcomes ' are for each pair of anyons @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",

    "we therefore can safely omit the label @xmath20 in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we now specify the physical constraints on the fusion rules :    a.   the vacuum @xmath7 is the unique label such that @xmath23 for all labels @xmath8 and @xmath17 , with @xmath24 denoting the kronecker delta .",
