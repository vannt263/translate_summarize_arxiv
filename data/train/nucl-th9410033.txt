    "with the recent advent of secondary beam facilities there has been a large research interest in nuclei near the drip lines .",
    "these exotic nuclei offer opportunities to study many - body effects under unusual conditions .",
    "an example of such can be related to the nucleon - nucleon [",
    "n - n ] interaction .",
    "while the free n - n interaction appears to be well understood , the role of the n - n interaction in microscopic nuclear structure is far from being clear .",
    "( one example where one would think that the role of the n - n interaction should be clear , but is not is in the @xmath3h problem . )",
    "because nuclei near the drip line have weak binding energies and hence large density distributions , the n - n interaction can now be studied in regions of low nuclear density .",
    "the free neutron - neutron [ n - n ] interaction is attractive , but the di - neutron system is unbound .",
    "migdal and watson postulated the possibility that a di - neutron may become bound if placed within the field of a nucleus .",
    "@xmath0li among others appears to be such a system , since both @xmath0li and @xmath1li are bound while @xmath4li is not .",
    "hence , with this in mind , recent interest in @xmath0li has been strongly addressed within a three - body framework @xcite , where @xmath0li is represented as two neutrons surrounding an inert @xmath1li core . for a recent review of such work , please see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the assumption that @xmath0li can be realistically represented as a three - body system needs to be investigated . while present experimental evidence indicates that this assumption may be valid @xcite , one would like to test this hypothesis within a many - body theoretical investigation .",
    "difficulties that may arise with the three - body framework include : 1 . )",
    "treatment of the pauli exclusion principle can only be performed approximately , and 2 . )",
    "correlations with the @xmath1li core are ignored .",
    "the most straightforward way to study @xmath0li in an @xmath5-body framework is to use a single particle model , but this was shown for this nucleus @xcite to give an inadequate description .",
    "therefore , for a proper @xmath5-body calculation a correlated description beyond a single particle model is required . by renormalizing the mean field",
    "potential several groups @xcite found that the experimental two neutron separation energy and the @xmath6 radius of @xmath0li could be reproduced , thus indicating the possible existence of correlations among the outer single particle states .",
    "an attempt to model correlations in a shell model description @xcite resulted in small effects , but as will be shown later in this paper the adopted shell model space used in this study is clearly too small .    in this paper",
    "we introduce long - range correlations by using a generator coordinate method [ gcm ] type formalism .",
    "the nuclear ground state [ gs ] is represented as a superposition of hfb nuclear states , which are obtained by constraining on different values of the @xmath7 collective variable .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular gcm variable can be understood in the following way : correlations in the @xmath0li gs are expected to occur because the loosely bound outer neutrons can occupy a large number of nearly degenerate rydberg - type orbits having a broad range of radial extensions .",
    "one expects that a constraint imposing different values of the total @xmath6 radius will act essentially on the outer neutrons radial distributions and therefore will be able to generate the kind of configurations present in the nuclear gs .",
    "therefore , as is usual in gcm calculations , initially , a series of constrained hfb microscopic mean field calculations is performed . in a second step",
    "the coefficients of the gcm configuration mixing are computed by solving the coupled equations resulting from the application of a variation principle to the total nucleus binding energy . in the present work , this is accomplished in an approximate fashion by reducing the usual hill - wheeler equations to a collective schrdinger equation of the bohr type .",
    "note that this calculation includes pairing correlations as well as long - range collective degrees of freedom as derived from the effective n - n interaction .",
    "also , the pauli principle is strictly obeyed through the use of fully antisymmetrized single particle wave functions .",
    "the only input into this consistent @xmath5-body calculation is the well - tested _ d1s _ _ gogny _ force .",
    "this interaction is a density - dependent phenomenological parametrization of the n - n interaction inside the nuclear medium which includes a spin - orbit term , and is finite - ranged .",
    "the parameters of the interaction have been fixed by matching the bulk properties of nuclear matter and of a few finite nuclei , including pairing correlation strengths .",
    "d1s _ force has been tested in a variety of applications with excellent results @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that this force gives a very good description not only of medium and heavy nuclei , but also of very light nuclei .",
    "for instance it describes correctly the binding energy and radius of the alpha particle .",
    "in addition the finite range , density - independent part of the force has been set - up in order to roughly simulate a free n - n interaction in the sense that it gives the correct n - n scattering lengths .",
    "these properties are important in the present context which deals with a three - proton system where almost free neutron - neutron interactions are expected to play a crucial role .    with this collective model a qualitative study of correlations in @xmath0li",
    "is presented .",
    "in particular the role of the @xmath1li core is explored , especially its relation to a free @xmath1li nucleus .",
    "the validity of the three - body hypothesis is investigated using a collective @xmath5-body model .    in section  ii the mean field constrained and unconstrained hfb calculation is described and the results presented .",
    "long - range correlations using a simplification of the gcm is described in section  iii along with the results and analysis , followed by a conclusion .",
    "the constrained hfb @xmath5-body calculation is performed using a nineteen shell axially - symmetric harmonic oscillator [ ho ] basis . in performing tests of the convergence of the basis",
    ", it was found that a nineteen shell basis is required due to the large extension of the neutron matter distribution from the center of the nucleus in coordinate space , and to the inadequate asymptotic behavior of ho states in @xmath8 space . the use of a multi - oscillator basis , _",
    "i.e. _ of a basis composed of several sets of concentric ho states associated with different lengths is also used in the hfb calculation .",
    "this kind of basis allows one to extend to larger distances the radial description of nucleon orbits .",
    "however , in this case only spherically symmetric nuclear distributions could be described .",
    "time - reversal symmetry is assumed , so the protons are described by blocking with equal weights the two @xmath9 axial quasi - particle orbitals , thus matching the known ground state spin of both @xmath0li and @xmath10li .    for a study of a small nucleus such as @xmath0li",
    ", it would be expected that a mean field description would not be the most appropriate choice . in this case",
    "we wish to address certain many - body questions and to test assumptions about the many - body nature of the problem . with this in mind as a first step , a mean field calculation using hfb should be able to address some of these qualitative concerns .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the @xmath0li nucleus is expected to be very soft against changes in the density distribution @xmath6 . for this reason",
    "a constrained hfb calculation was performed , where the constraint variable used corresponds to the mean value of @xmath7 : @xmath11    when the constraint is switched off , one gets the mean - field representation of the @xmath0li gs . the total @xmath6 matter radius obtained in this way is about 2.80  fm , matching the results of several other groups @xcite .",
    "the separate proton and neutron @xmath6 radii are found to be 2.30 and 2.97  fm , respectively . for a similar hfb calculation of the @xmath10li gs the @xmath6 radii",
    "are found to be 2.47 , 2.24 , and 2.58  fm for the total , proton and neutron distributions , respectively .",
    "the @xmath6 radii for the protons in @xmath10li and @xmath0li differ only by a small amount in these mean - field calculations , resulting from the effects of the force between the neutrons and the protons .",
    "however , when correlations are introduced in @xmath0li , if there is an uncorrelated @xmath10li core in @xmath0li , it may well differ from the free @xmath10li gs . it remains to be seen though how large this difference may be .    in fig .",
    "1 the results of the constrained @xmath0li calculation are shown as a function of the constraint variable , @xmath12 .",
    "a similar spherical @xmath1li calculation is also shown .",
    "as @xmath12 is increased , the @xmath0li curve is much softer than @xmath1li in the sense that the slope is much less steep .",
    "one then expects @xmath0li to include significantly more configuration mixing than @xmath1li .",
    "such a mixing has been included and will be discussed in detail later .",
    "the @xmath6 radii for the neutron and proton distributions are shown in fig .",
    "2a for the constrained hfb results as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "as expected ( see the introduction ) the proton @xmath6 is unaffected by the constraint , while the neutron @xmath14 varies linearly .",
    "in other words , the curve confirms that the potential between the protons and outer neutrons is not strong enough to prevent the two distributions from decoupling .",
    "the independent nature of the proton and neutron sectors is also evident in the pairing energy shown in fig .",
    "the protons consistently have zero pairing as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the neutrons have strong pairing for @xmath15  fm indicating the onset of a significantly high neutron level density at the fermi surface .",
    "since the protons do not exhibit pairing there must be a sizeable gap at the fermi surface .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "3a , where the protons occupying the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states .",
    "there is a gap of about @xmath18  mev between the @xmath17 level and the higher single particle levels and this gap remains for all @xmath12 considered .",
    "the relative energies of the occupied levels do not change significantly as a function of @xmath12 , confirming the negligible influence of the constraint on the proton mean - field .",
    "note that , since the @xmath17 level does not shift a great deal , the blocking approximation used here to account for the odd number of protons should be reasonable .    in fig .",
    "3b the corresponding neutron single particle levels are shown .",
    "the lowest six neutrons are almost completely contained in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals . due to pairing correlations",
    "the last two neutrons are dispersed throughout the higher levels .",
    "there is almost no gap between the @xmath19 level and the higher levels , and for large @xmath12 these levels cross .",
    "the levels higher than @xmath20 are not shown .",
    "the level density at the fermi surface is very high , indicating that configuration mixing , _",
    "i.e. _ the existence of correlations is widespread .",
    "this result is an indication that the model space required to describe the @xmath0li gs in an extended shell model calculation is much larger than generally assumed  @xcite . according to the present calculation levels above the @xmath21  shell",
    "surely contribute to the gs description .    in fig .",
    "3b it is clear that there is a large gap between the six inner neutrons , which represent a @xmath1li core , and the outer two valence neutrons .",
    "the calculated occupation probabilities for the core neutrons are almost always between @xmath22 and @xmath23 with a minimum of @xmath24 .",
    "this is true for all @xmath12 considered .",
    "because of these features , a @xmath1li core wave function can be projected out by taking the constrained hfb @xmath0li solutions and explicitly setting the first six neutron levels to have one occupation probability and the other neutron levels to be empty . as evidenced by the fact that the core neutron probabilities are",
    "not exactly one , this is an approximate procedure , but clearly , because of the large energy gap , this should be a very reasonable and accurate representation .    in fig .",
    "4 the neutron density profiles are shown for the unconstrained hfb calculations of @xmath1li and @xmath0li , and for the @xmath1li core projected from @xmath0li as explained above . at the center of the nucleus",
    "the free @xmath1li neutron density is sizeably larger than the @xmath1li core neutron density , and accordingly , the @xmath1li core extends somewhat farther .",
    "more precisely , the central neutron density of @xmath10li ( short - dashed curve ) is about 15% larger than that of the @xmath10li core ( long dashed curve ) .",
    "a similar difference was found for the protons .",
    "this is more easily seen when the tail is expanded in a logarithmic plot .",
    "the the @xmath0li core neutrons density does nt fall off as rapidly beyond @xmath25  fm .",
    "already one can see evidence for the beginning of a halo - like structure .",
    "from the evidence shown in the previous two sections it is clear that a pure single particle model is inadequate to describe @xmath0li . to provide a more sophisticated representation ,",
    "a correlated ground state wave function is constructed as a superposition of the hfb nuclear states in the following gcm form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a product of hfb quasiparticle states for deformation @xmath12 , @xmath28 is a weight function , and @xmath12 is the constraint variable . in the gcm formalism",
    "a hamiltonian kernel is constructed with the gcm wave function . by applying the variational principle ,",
    "an equation is derived from which the weight functions can be calculated .",
    "a gaussian overlap approximation [ goa ] , where the overlap between any two hfb states is approximated by a gaussian in the collective variable @xcite , is applied to simplify these equations , deriving a bohr hamiltonian expression .",
    "the solution of the bohr hamiltonian equation gives the weight function , @xmath28 .",
    "these techniques have been thoroughly tested in many instances @xcite .",
    "it may be that the goa is not as accurate for smaller nuclei as in previous experience , but for the investigative study being performed here , this should be more than adequate",
    ".    the resulting ground state collective wave function , @xmath28 , has a corresponding total binding energy . to properly calculate the two neutron separation energy it is necessary to perform a similar collective calculation for the free @xmath1li case and then to take the difference in the total collective binding energies . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the energies calculated from the single particle hfb model are inadequate and it is necessary to include more sophisticated degrees of freedom .",
    "the ground state correlated density is calculated from ( [ eq:3 ] ) in the following fashion : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radial density operator obtained after angle averaging .    in fig .",
    "5 the proton density profile is shown from the unconstrained hfb calculation of @xmath1li and @xmath0li along with the gcm - type collective result for @xmath0li . as is apparent here",
    "the @xmath1li and @xmath0li proton profiles are not equivalent , implying differences between the free @xmath1li nucleus and the @xmath1li core of @xmath0li .",
    "the correlated @xmath0li proton density is very similar to the uncorrelated @xmath0li result , which should not be surprising in light of the unchanging single particle spectrum in fig .  3a . for the protons",
    "the correlations have little effect upon the density distributions both near the central part and along the tail .",
    "it appears clear that there are few correlations in the @xmath0li proton sector .",
    "the various neutron distributions are shown in fig .",
    "6 . as in the unconstrained hfb case an approximate representation of the @xmath1li core can be projected out from the @xmath0li calculation including configuration mixing .",
    "this is performed by setting the neutron occupation propabilities in the constrained hfb solutions to be either one or zero and then using these density matrices with the weight function , @xmath28 , obtained in the collective @xmath0li calculation . as for the proton case",
    "the influence of correlations on the @xmath1li core appears quite small .",
    "the collective long - range correlations represented by the gcm therefore have little effect on the @xmath1li core as a whole .",
    "this influence is much bigger on the full @xmath0li neutron distribution , that is when one includes the two extra neutrons .",
    "the surface of the neutron distribution of @xmath0li is at about @xmath31  fm , which is much further extended than the surface of the proton distribution at @xmath32  fm .",
    "correlations slightly reduce this difference .",
    "substracting the @xmath1li core neutron distribution from the @xmath0li neutrons gives the structure of the two valence neutrons .",
    "the two neutrons have zero density at the origin due to the pauli blocking from the core and extend in a halo - like structure . at the surface",
    "the collective valence structure causes the collective calculation to have a different neutron density profile than the unconstrained hfb neutrons .",
    "this is most easily seen on the logarithmic plot in the lower part of fig .  6 :",
    "the hfb and gcm gs @xmath0li neutron densities strongly differ beyond @xmath33  fm . at this point",
    "it must be emphasized that an unphysical ledge appears in the gcm densities beyond @xmath34  fm .",
    "this ledge is small in amplitude , but it affects greatly the calculated @xmath6 radius since it extends very far out . the origin of this ledge can be traced back to the structure of the hfb constrained solutions included in the configuration mixing . in fig .",
    "7 the neutron densities obtained in constrained hfb calculations using the nineteen shell basis at @xmath35  fm and @xmath36  fm are shown .",
    "also shown are the same results using a multi - oscillator spherical hfb basis .",
    "this particular multi - oscillator basis uses three concentric sets of eight shell bases with three different oscillator lengths .",
    "this basis corresponds to a very large single oscillator basis ( @xmath37  shells ) .",
    "clearly , a ledge appears in the hfb densities which depends on the basis . with the large multi - oscillator basis",
    "the ledge appears two orders of magnitude smaller and at larger @xmath8 .",
    "this ledge is a result of the constraint on @xmath7 , that tends to push up the density at large @xmath8 , but then is restricted by the local nature of the harmonic oscillator bases .",
    "one in fact observes the parabolic fall of the densities in the 19 shell ho basis , characteristic of the ho asymptotic behavior at large @xmath8 .",
    "a similar parabolic fall of the multi - oscillator densities is also observed at very large @xmath8 ( 30 fm ) .",
    "both the property of @xmath38 to be unbounded and the use of a restricted ho space may be responsible for this phenomenon    since there clearly exists a great deal of configuration mixing in @xmath0li due to the radial extension of outer neutrons , one would also like to be able to extract a reasonable asymptotic tail for the gs wave function .",
    "this is necessary to get a reasonable estimate of the gs neutron @xmath6 radius .",
    "the single particle wave functions should asymptotically be proportional to : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the single particle energy . for large but finite @xmath8 a polynomial in @xmath41 should be included .",
    "therefore , one expects the hfb neutron density to behave for large @xmath8 , @xmath42 say , as : @xmath43 ^ 2 ,    \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] this form has been used to extrapolate the densities obtained in the multi - oscillator basis for values of @xmath8 beyond the values where the unphysical ledge begins .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 were obtained by using a @xmath47 fitting routine .",
    "@xmath48 was chosen to match the small @xmath8 density profile at @xmath49 , where the tail was attached to the single oscillator calculation , typically at about @xmath50  fm .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in the correlated densities ( 3 ) could then be computed from : @xmath51    \\left [ 1 + \\frac{b_q}{r } + \\frac{c_q}{r^2}\\right ] .\\ ] ] there is a great deal of freedom in the choice of the tail parameters and hence we were able to obtain various different parameter sets , depending on how we chose to fix things .",
    "the @xmath44 parameters were set to be between @xmath52 , which corresponds to energies of about @xmath53  mev .    with these fitted tails fig .",
    "8 is obtained .",
    "different sets of fitted tail parameters are labeled by a , b , c , d , e. they give slightly but not very different values for the extrapolated density above @xmath54 .",
    "note that here the tails extend further out than for the unconstrained hfb case .",
    "let us now turn to result concerning @xmath6 radii . in table",
    "i the @xmath6 radii for the various densities of figs . 4 , 5 and 6 are shown .",
    "the correlations change the calculated @xmath6 radii for the @xmath10li core by only about 2% , which is consistent with the previous observation that correlations have a negligible effect upon the core . in this change",
    "the tail correction made above plays almost no role . as to the differences in the @xmath6 radii between the @xmath10li nucleus and the values calculated for the @xmath10li core , they are about 5% for both the protons and the neutrons . this effect upon",
    "the @xmath6 radius appears to be small , but the comparison of the density distributions made in the previous section yields a more pronounced difference .",
    "one may say that the @xmath10li system is slightly inflated when two extra neutron are added .",
    "this comparison assumes that the @xmath10li nucleus ground state wave function is not significantly influenced by correlations , which certainly is reasonable in view of the insensitivity of correlations on the @xmath10li core .",
    "again , the comparisons made for the nine - nucleon systems do nt depend on the tail correction introduced previously .",
    "one may conclude that in this many - body calculation of @xmath0li there appears to exist a substantive @xmath10li core which notably differs from a free @xmath10li nucleus .",
    "one expects that these differences may have a nonnegligible effect upon the mean field felt by the two outer neutrons .",
    "going to the full @xmath0li @xmath6 radii , the value listed in table  i with correlations included , but without tail correction ( 3.42 fm ) , clearly is overestimated . in table",
    "ii the @xmath6 radii obtained without and with the various parametrized tail corrections are listed .",
    "the largest @xmath55 using a fitted tail is case  @xmath56 with @xmath57  fm . in the calculations performed here ,",
    "the increase in @xmath6 radii due to correlations is between @xmath58  fm with realistic tails .",
    "this result is somewhat disappointing in view of the the amount of complexity put into the gs wave - functions .",
    "the total and neutron @xmath6 radii , although not so far from consistent with the experimental error bars , appear @xmath59  fm smaller than the nominal experimentally extracted values .    at this point",
    ", one may note that the present radius results probably represent lowest values .",
    "in fact , when using the multi - oscillator basis the resulting potential energy surface appears somewhat flatter than the nineteen shell basis shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this indicates that that a fully realistic calculation where density tails would be correctly described , would also yield a much softer collective potential and therefore a stronger configuration mixing .",
    "hence effects of correlations larger than those derived here , especially with respect to the @xmath6 radius predictions , would certainly be found .",
    "finally let us mention that , since the present @xmath0li calculations were performed assuming axial symmetry , we were able to calculate the electric quadrupole moments , both in the hfb and correlated calculations .",
    "it should be realized that since the proton sector was calculated with a blocking approximation , the ground state spin of the nucleus has been artificially set . in table",
    "iii the calculated axial quadrupole moments are displayed for @xmath0li and @xmath1li . since the proton sector is not greatly affected by the correlations ,",
    "the hfb and correlated gcm calculations give approximately the same charge quadrupole moment .",
    "both of these results give remarkable agreement with the experimental result . the free @xmath1li hfb result is also shown , where here the agreement is not nearly as close .",
    "a microscopic many - body calculation of @xmath0li is presented with correlations . pairing correlations",
    "are included in a constrained hfb calculation , while important long - range correlations are incorporated using a gcm type formalism .",
    "the sole input into the calculation is the well - tested , finite - range _ d1s _ effective interaction .",
    "it was found that long - range correlations play an important role in the description of @xmath0li .",
    "a distinct @xmath1li core was found which remained uncoupled to both pairing and long - range correlations .",
    "the correlations were restricted almost exclusively to the sector occupied by the two valence neutrons .",
    "this substantive core appears to support the use of a three - body framework to study this nucleus , although several factors must be considered .",
    "the pauli principle acting between the @xmath1li core neutrons and the two valence neutrons must be taken into account as seen in fig .",
    "6 . also , the @xmath1li core found here appears to have a significantly different density profile than a free @xmath1li nucleus .",
    "it may be necessary for three - body calculations to take into account the different density shape of the @xmath1li core if more accurate calculations of this type are desired than those presently in existence .",
    "difficulties in this many - body treatment of @xmath0li were encountered due to the use of naturally localized harmonic oscillator bases . even with the use of an extended multi - oscillators dependences upon the basis were found . for a more complete and accurate calculation",
    "it would be necessary to use a better basis representation , which can accomodate a nucleus with a large extended tail .",
    "for example a collocation basis spline basis in a very large box would probably work well .",
