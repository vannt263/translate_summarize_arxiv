    "gravitational wave detectors will soon begin operation and may see signals from sources such as binary neutron stars .",
    "an important issue in the dynamics of these binaries is whether tidal interaction between the neutron stars induces each one to collapse to form a black hole during the late stages of inspiral ( and references therein ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown that the stars either have a very slight tendency towards individual collapse or are completely stable to such collapse ( see e.g.  ) .",
    "given the complexity of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations , it is useful to study simpler models in order to understand the physical underpinnings of tidally induced collapse ( or stability against collapse ) in neutron star binaries .",
    "one such model was considered by shapiro and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it consists of a cluster of collisionless particles orbiting a non - rotating black hole , which is part of a widely separated circular binary .",
    "they found that as the hole s companion body spirals in slowly , its tidal field induces inward collapse ( into the hole ) of the cluster .",
    "however , they restricted attention to the effect of the companion body s electric - type tidal field . in the real physical situation of binary neutron stars , magnetic - type tidal fields may play an important role in the stability of the stars .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the companion body s magnetic - type tidal field on the evolution of the particle cluster .",
    "consider a binary system composed of a non - rotating black hole of mass @xmath0 and a companion body of mass @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "denote the binary s orbital separation by @xmath4 .",
    "define the following newtonian quantities : the relative velocity @xmath5 , and the orbital angular velocity @xmath6 by assumption , @xmath7 , so @xmath8 .    assume the binary is in a circular orbit that decays due to emission of newtonian quadrupole gravitational radiation .",
    "this means the separation @xmath4 evolves as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "since the binary is widely separated , the region near the black hole can be described by a tidally perturbed schwarzschild metric .",
    "cover this region by schwarzschild coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "additional coordinate systems that will be useful are isotropic coordinates @xmath12 and spherical isotropic coordinates @xmath13 , which are related to schwarzschild coordinates via @xmath14    place a set of test particles at random positions on the sphere @xmath15 and let their initial velocities be in random directions tangent to the sphere . in the test particle approximation , each particle moves along a geodesic of the tidally perturbed schwarzschild metric . set the magnitude of each particle s initial velocity to yield a circular orbit when @xmath16 .",
    "determine the cluster s time evolution by integrating the geodesic equation and assuming the particles do not collide .",
    "given a 3 + 1 split of spacetime or a local reference frame , one can separate the ten independent components of the weyl tensor into an electric- and a magnetic - type tidal tensor , each having five independent components ( see e.g.  secs .",
    "v.a.2 - 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the companion body s tidal fields as seen by an inertial observer in the black hole s local asymptotic rest frame .",
    "this observer sees an electric - type tidal field whose typical components have magnitude @xmath17 , where `` @xmath18 '' means `` is of the order of '' .",
    "if the companion body was stationary with respect to the black hole , the observer would not see a magnetic - type tidal field .",
    "the motion of the companion at velocity @xmath19 with respect to the black hole induces , via a lorentz boost with velocity @xmath19 , a magnetic - type tidal field whose typical components have magnitude @xmath20 as seen by the inertial observer @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic - type tidal force experienced by a particle moving in the local asymptotic rest frame is of order @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the particle s mass , @xmath23 is the particle s velocity as measured by the inertial observer , and @xmath24 is the particle s orbital radius .",
    "this is smaller by a factor of @xmath25 than the electric - type tidal force @xmath26 .    now consider a particle cluster at @xmath27 .",
    "the representative particle velocity of this cluster is @xmath28 .",
    "shapiro and collaborators set @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and observe cluster collapse when the companion body reaches @xmath31 @xcite . at that point , @xmath32 , so the magnetic - type tidal forces on the particles are a significant fraction of the electric ones .",
    "furthermore , the two types of tidal forces typically point in different directions .",
    "therefore , the magnetic - type tidal field could have an important effect on the dynamics of the cluster . in the next sections",
    ", we investigate this issue .",
    "the leading order electric- and magnetic - type tidal deformations of a non - rotating black hole in a widely separated circular binary have been calculated in @xcite using black hole perturbation theory .",

    "the rotation rate @xmath35 of the companion body s tidal field , as measured by an inertial observer in the black hole s local asymptotic rest frame , differs from the newtonian orbital angular velocity @xmath36 because of precession effects @xcite .",
    "the magnetic - type tidal perturbation on the black hole is embodied in the metric components @xmath37 and @xmath38 in ( [ schwmetric ] ) . setting @xmath39 yields the metric utilized in @xcite ; this metric contains only the electric - type tidal perturbation . in what follows ,",
    "we sometimes switch off the magnetic - type tidal perturbation by setting @xmath39 , in order to isolate magnetic - type tidal effects and to compare with the results in @xcite .",
    "if we ignore radiation reaction , the binary s orbit remains circular and @xmath35 is constant .",
    "in this situation , the vector field @xmath40 is a killing field of the metric  ( [ schwmetric ] ) , and @xmath41 is constant along each particle s geodesic worldline , where @xmath42 is the particle s four - velocity .",
    "this constancy serves as an important check on our numerics .",

    "a large number of particles plunge into the black hole at @xmath60 , causing a sudden decrease of @xmath58 ( as seen in the figure ) .",
