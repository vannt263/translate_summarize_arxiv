    "the chvtal model was instrumental in @xcite for a sharp analysis of the karp - sipser greedy matching algorithm in @xmath57 .",
    "the directed version enables us to view the deletion algorithm as a markov process on the set of the @xmath81-tuples , whose components are counts of vertices of various , relevant , in / out - degrees , with an additional component recording the current number of edges .    in section 2.2",
    ", we derive the asymptotic formulas for the expected , conditional , change of the current @xmath81-tuple .",
    "the computations are necessarily technical , but are conceptually simple , as our approach does not require knowledge of the conditional distribution of that change .",
    "we like to think of this part as exploring the probabilistic infrastructure of the deletion algorithm .",
    "the resulting list of @xmath81 identities does look intimidating , but it leads to a system of identities for changes of a leading subset of just @xmath82 parameters , no matter how large @xmath1 and @xmath2 are . to be sure",
    "this subsystem is not exactly closed , as it contains the current number of non - isolated light vertices , not expressible through those @xmath82 parameters .    in section 3",
    "we use these expected changes as a motivation for putting forth a deterministic ordinary differential equation ( ode ) system , of @xmath81 equations , anticipating that its solution will be a sharp approximation of the random realization of the deletion process .    in section 3.1",
    "we identify two integrals , i.e. two functions of those @xmath82 leading parameters , that remain constant along the ode trajectories , in a promising harmony with the integrals in pittel and poole @xcite paper on the distribution of the giant @xmath83-core in @xmath5 , @xcite ( @xmath56-core in @xmath57 ) , and @xcite ( maximum matching in @xmath57 ) .    in section 3.2",
    "we establish a condition ( lemma [ 1,2 ] ) sufficient for the ode trajectory to terminate at a finite time .    in section 3.3",

    "we translate the conditions for @xmath26 into a `` variational principle '' , lemma [ c*,genk1,k2 ] .",
    "finally , in section 4 we use a general purpose theorem , due to wormald @xcite , and a probabilistic counterpart of the argument in section 3.3 , to show that @xmath26 is the edge density threshold for a giant @xmath0-core in @xmath74)$ ] .",
    "we begin with description of a deletion algorithm that delivers the @xmath0-core of a given digraph @xmath84 .",
    "we call a vertex of a digraph light if either its in - degree is at most @xmath85 , or its out - degree is at most @xmath86 .",
    "set @xmath87 .",
    "recursively , in a current digraph @xmath88 we choose uniformly at random a non - isolated light vertex and delete all the edges incident to this vertex .",
    "this procedure determines the next digraph @xmath89 .",
    "the terminal digraph is the ( possibly empty ) @xmath0-core of the digraph @xmath84 complemented by a set of isolated vertices .",
    "our task is to analyze the likely behavior of this algorithm applied to the random digraph @xmath5 .",
    "we notice upfront that , for @xmath90 , with probability @xmath91 the @xmath14-core of @xmath92)$ ] is either empty , or of size @xmath93 at least , where @xmath94 this claim is a directed counterpart of a well - known result of uczak @xcite for the @xmath56-core in the random graph @xmath95 .",
    "similarly to the argument in that paper , the proof is based on the asymptotic estimate of the expected number of sub - digraphs with the number of edges at least @xmath56 times the number of vertices .",
    "thus we may and will stop the deletion process once the total number of vertices with in - degree and out - degree exceeding @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , drops below , says , @xmath96 : if continued , w.h.p . the deletion process will end with the empty digraph .",
    "+ now down to brass tacks . to handle the considerable technical details",

    "first of all , conditioned on the event `` @xmath109 '' ( i.e. no loops or parallel edges ) , @xmath99 is distributed as @xmath5 .",
    "second , for @xmath110 , @xmath111 thus uniformly over all events @xmath112 @xmath113 therefore to show that an event @xmath114 is unlikely for @xmath5 it suffices to prove that @xmath114 is unlikely for @xmath99 .",
    "and @xmath99 is incomparably easier to deal with .",
