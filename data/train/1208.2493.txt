    "after forty years of studies , we are still far from a full understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "accurate measurements of grb parameters , such as their position , redshift , peak - energy and so on , are needed to further understand grbs themselves and their use as astrophysical tools .",
    "svom ( space - based multi - band astronomical variable object monitor ) @xcite@xcite is a future chinese - french satellite mission which is dedicated to grb studies .",
    "the payload aboard svom consists of two high - energy instruments , the grm and eclairs , together with two low - energy instruments .",
    "grm is a gamma ray monitor , and eclairs is a coded - mask camera for x- and gamma - rays .",
    "together , they can provide grb localizations and grb spectral observations from a few kev to a few mev .",
    "this wide spectral range is crucial to determine as accurately as possible the grb peak - energy , which is a key parameter to make use of grbs as `` standard candles '' and extend the measurement of the cosmological parameters at large redshifts @xcite@xcite .",
    "svom is a low earth orbit ( leo ) mission with an altitude of 600 km and an inclination of 30@xmath0 .",
    "its instruments point close the anti - solar direction during a large fraction of the orbit in order to permit the follow - up observations by large ground - based telescopes to optimize the redshift measurements @xcite@xcite .",
    "this strategy makes the earth get in and out of the detector s field of the view ( thereafter fov ) once per orbit .",
    "the detectors will not operate when crossing the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) for protection from the too high particle flux , which results in a decrease of the observation time .",
    "these factors will cause the instrumental background to change when the earth gets in and out of the fov and with time . in this paper , we present a study on how the gamma - ray background of grm and eclairs changes with the earth position in the fov .",
    "the impact of these changes on the sensitivity and grb detection rate are estimated as well .",
    "this background research laid the groundwork for the investigation of the grb trigger strategy of grm and eclairs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :     [ sec : instr ] in this section , we briefly describe the two high energy instruments aboard svom .",
    " [ sec : simu ] the detector mass - models , the simulation method and the spectral models of gamma - ray background sources are described in this section .    ",
    "[ sec : results ] the background simulation results , the computations of the detector sensitivities and the grb detection rates are presented in this section .",
    " [ sec : conc ] we conclude with a concise summary and a discussion of some limitations of our method as well as some further improvements .",
    "the main parts of grm are two identical gamma ray detector ( grd ) units , which are spectrometers without localization capabilities , sensitive in the energy range from  30 kev to  5 mev .",
    "each grd is equipped with one auxiliary calibration detector , which mainly consists of a plastic scintillator and an embedded @xmath1am source , in the collimator above the entrance window .",
    "a charged particle detector is mounted to alert the high - voltage supplies of pmts to switch off or on .",
    "the grd consists of three scintillator layers ( see figure [ fig : crystal ] ) which are plastic scintillator , nai(tl ) and csi(na ) respectively .",
    "they are glued together and viewed with the same light guide coupled to a pmt .",
    "the pulse shapes generated by the different scintillators can be distinguished by the pulse shape discrimination circuit ( psd ) .",
    "the 15 mm thick nai(tl ) crystal with a diameter of 190 mm works as the main detecting element .",
    "the csi(na ) crystal , which is 35 mm thick and has the same diameter as nai(tl ) , located behind nai(tl ) is another important detection element and serves also as anti - coincidence element against photons from behind .",
    "the element located on top of nai(tl ) is the organic scintillator , dedicated to reject background events due to charged particles .",
    "the structure of organic scintillator has been modified since the previous design described in @xcite can not shield - off efficiently the photons from the side and its design is more complex .",
    "the beryllium plate with a thickness of 1.5 mm is chosen as entrance window of this triple phoswich detector .",
    "a collimator made of tantalum is located in front of the scintillator case to reduce the background by limiting the fov to 2.5 steradians .",
    "the main components of grd are shown in figure [ fig : crystal ] .",
    "eclairs is a coded - mask imaging camera with a 2 sr - wide fov , with a source localization accuracy better than 10 arcmin , sensitive in the 4 kev - 250 kev energy range .",
    "its main entity is an imaging camera for x- and gamma - rays ( cxg ) which mainly consists of a detection plane of 80@xmath280 cdte semiconductor detectors , a coded - mask located above the detection plane , a multi - layer lateral shield and mechanical structures , etc .",
    "eclairs is also equipped with an onboard scientific trigger unit ( uts ) @xcite which seeks in real - time for grbs and determines their localization for follow - up observations . for a detailed description of eclairs ,",
    "see @xcite@xcite .",
    "in this section , the mass models of grm and eclairs used to perform our simulations , the simulation method as well as the corresponding background models are described .",
    "the simulations have been performed with release 4.9.3p02 of the geant4 toolkit @xcite . in accordance with the design of grm , whose",
    "components and main characteristics are described in section [ sec : instr ] , its mass model was built . in order to be close to reality , the other payloads , the payload board and the satellite platform are also considered in the mass model , as shown in figure [ fig : massmodel ] ( left ) .",
    "but currently only grds are detailed , the others are represented by shells of aluminum with shapes and thickness corresponding to their latest design .     and figure [ fig : crystal ] ) as well as the shells of other payloads .",
    "the grey boxes correspond to the satellite platform and payload board ( not the exact structure of the spacecraft ) .",
    "( right ) scheme of the mass model of cxg as well as the cold plate and the readout electronics box placed under the camera .",
    "the gray box corresponds to the satellite platform . ]    for eclairs , the cdte detectors , the ceramics , the asics , the multi - layered shield composed of pb / cu / honeycomb / cu , the coded mask made of a ta - w alloy , the multi - layer thermal coating insulation ( mli ) above the coded mask , the ta6v upper and lower supports of the mask , as well as simplified versions of the cold plate in albemet and the readout electronics boxes are considered in the mass model .",
    "the platform is represented by a 1 m@xmath3 and 300 kg pseudo - aluminum cube .    in the background simulations ,",
    "the most important point is to study how the background varies with the earth position in the fov . in practice , we keep the satellite static and let the earth rotate around it . the establishment of the coordinate system is shown in figure [ fig : massmodel ] : the z axis points to the opposite direction of the fov and the coordinate origin is at the center of the satellite .",
    "when the earth rotates from z to -z , the angle changes from 0@xmath0 to 180@xmath0 .",
    "we divide the half orbit equally into 7 pieces , with an angle - interval of 25.7@xmath0 . for each piece of orbit ,",
    "the earth position can be represented by a typical position approximately . and",
    "the zenith angle of each typical position in the coordinate is used to express the earth position .",
    "the typical earth position of rotate 0@xmath0 means that the earth is on z and rotate 180@xmath0 is the earth position which is on -z .",
    "other typical positions in between are rotate 30@xmath0 , rotate 60@xmath0 , rotate 90@xmath0 , rotate 120@xmath0 and rotate 150@xmath0 respectively .",
    "when the earth rotates from -z to z , this half orbit is also divided equally into 7 pieces as the same as that from z to -z .",
    "hence the 7 pieces from -z to z are axisymmetric with those from z to -z respectively , and can still be represented by the 7 typical positions ( rotate 0@xmath0 - rotate 180@xmath0 ) .",
    "here we assume that for different earth positions with the same zenith angle but different azimuth angles , the background level is the same . with the assumptions and simplifications above , we can now simulate the background levels with the 7 typical earth positions , and each position lasts 1/7 of the orbital period .",
    "these assumptions will be used in section [ sec : sensitivity ] to derive a first order estimation of grb detection rate .",
    "the satellite will be subject to different sources of background in space : ( i ) extragalactic components including cosmic x- and gamma - rays , protons , electrons , positrons , and cosmic he - nuclei , etc . ;",
    "( ii ) near earth components consisting of albedo gamma - rays , albedo neutrons , albedo electrons , albedo positrons and the secondary protons located under the radiation belt ; ( iii ) as well as the particles from the sun .    in this paper three",
    "kinds of gamma - ray background are investigated in detail , which are the main background components in the enregy range of our interest and include cosmic gamma - rays , albedo gamma - rays and reflected cosmic gamma - rays .",
    "we adopt the latest spectral models which are moretti2009 @xcite , sazonov2007 @xcite and churazov2006 @xcite@xcite respectively . for convenience",
    ", we will denote cosmic gamma - ray background , reflected cosmic gamma - ray background and albedo gamma - ray background as cxb , reflection and albedo respectively in the following context , and if there is no specific declaration the term background only means the gamma - ray background .    for eclairs ,",
    "the background is dominated by the gamma - ray background below 100 kev outside saa .",
    "and the proportion of the background due to the direct interactions with particles such as electrons , protons and neutrons is about 10% @xcite@xcite . concerning the delayed background mainly introduced by the trapped particles inside saa , it is outside the scope of this work and we will not discuss it in detail . for grm , in addtion to our simulations of gamma - ray background ,",
    "g. li estimated the background induced by the cosmic protons and electrons , the secondary protons and electrons , as well as the trapped protons in saa , when the earth is at rotate 0@xmath0 using the method provided in @xcite . with these two parts of work , we obtained that ( g. li , personal communications , 2011 ) the average proportion of the gamma - ray background in all kinds of background is approximately 80% in the energy range 50 kev-300 kev for grm_nai .",
    "the average proportion of the delayed background caused by the trapped protons in saa region is less than 15% below 300 kev , and is approximately 50% above 550 kev . for grm_csi ,",
    "the proportion of the delayed background is slightly higher .",
    "the background which is used to do calculations in section [ sec : sensitivity ] only includes the three kinds of gamma - ray background .",
    "the spectral model of moretti2009 which is described by equation ( 1 ) is adopted for cxb simulations .",
    "this model was produced by taking advantage of both swift - xrt and swift - bat databases in the energy band 1.5 - 200 kev .",
    "the spatial distribution is isotropic in a 4@xmath4 solid angle .",
    "the earth occultation is considered in the post - processing after the simulations with geant4 .",
    "@xmath5\\ ] ]    ajello2008 @xcite is another recent model with a smoothly joined double power law .",
    "it was obtained by fitting the data in the 2 kev-2 mev range . below 500 kev ,",
    "the relative error is less than 20% using model moretti2009 and ajello2008 .",
    "and above 500 kev , the statistical fluctuation is much larger than the relative error .",
    "other models such as sreekumar1998 @xcite and gruber1999 @xcite were also compared .",
    "since there is not much difference using these models for grm , and considering that moretti2009 is a credible model for eclairs , we finally determined to use the model moretti2009 for both grm and eclairs .",
    "the outer layers of the earth s atmosphere reflect part of the incident x- and gamma - ray spectrum via compton scattering .",
    "the spectrum in the 1 - 1000 kev energy range reflected by the earth s atmosphere was calculated by churazov et al .",
    "the ratio of the reflection spectrum to the incident spectrum is approximated by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the incident spectrum is the cxb model suggested by gruber et al .",
    "the reflection is most significant near 60 kev and declines towards lower or higher energies .",
    "since the incident directions of photons are connected with earth positions , some methods used in simulations are similar to those for albedo photons described in section [ sec : albedo ] .",
    "@xmath6      the albedo gamma - ray background consists of the atmospheric hard x - ray emission which is induced by cosmic rays such as energetic protons , alpha particles , cosmic electrons and positrons as well as secondary electrons and positrons .",
    "sazonov et al . found that the shape of the spectrum emergent from the atmosphere in the range 25 - 300 kev is mainly determined by compton scattering and photo - absorption , and is almost insensitive to the incident cosmic - ray spectrum .",

    "]    * hard x - ray surface brightness use *    in order to compute the hard x - ray surface brightness at a given satellite position we propose the following methodology :    for a given satellite position , we define a new reference frame oxyz in a spherical coordinate system with the z axis going from the earth center trough the svom satellite .",
    "the atmosphere elementary elements of the spherical cap are represented by the coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the oxyz frame ( see figure 4 . ) . in practice",
    "we divided the atmosphere spherical cap into 2400 elementary areas with 20 @xmath17 and 120 @xmath18 steps ( a compromise between accuracy and computation time ) .",

    "figure [ fig : nai1 ] and figure [ fig : nai2 ] present the changes of the three kinds of background in the nai as well as the total background with earth positions .    from figure",

    "for the same reason we can not see obvious differences in the background when the earth rotates less than 90@xmath0 from the back of grm .",
    "the emission peak of 57 kev in the cxb spectrum is due to the element tantalum in the collimator . when the earth enters the fov , less cosmic photons",

    "[ tab:2 ] , the fov is the field of view which is not obstructed by the earth ; the sensitivity , which is the minimum flux that can be detected , is derived from the formula ( [ equ : snr ] ) . for eclairs , the earth occultation results in the background with magnitude difference at low energy ( see figure [ fig : cxg1 ] ) .",

    ", the grb detection - rate calculation is based on batse observation and uses the algorithm given by band @xcite which was used by dong @xcite . within the assumptions , we can detecte 66 grbs / year with eclairs and 74 grbs / year with grm taking into account the crystal nai only . applying the same method to the crystal csi",
    ", 7 grbs / year are obtained .",
    "we take the grb detection rate coressponding to rotate 0@xmath0 as 100% .",
    "and then we get the relative grb detection rate for each earth position as shown in figure [ fig : ngrb ] .",
    "the main idea of the algorithm of band @xcite is to compare the sensitivity to that of batse in the energy range 50 - 300 kev .",
    "it is a very good algorithm to estimate the grb detection rate of grm using the data of nai .",
    "but for using the data of csi , it is not a good choice because of its low detection efficiency ( @xmath145.5% ) in the energy range 50 - 300 kev .",
    "the sensitive energy of csi is above 300 kev , and its detection efficiency is approximately 38% in 300 - 1000 kev taking into account the average grb band spectrum of batse . the number of hard grbs detected by svom can probably be increased by finding other methods to use the data of csi in the energy range 300 - 1000 kev .",
    "this study will be performed in a further work .",
    "in this work , three kinds of background varying with earth positions have been simulated for grm and eclairs which are two high - energy instruments aboard the svom mission . in particularly , the simulations of albedo with the model of sazonov2007 are described in detail for its complexity and precision . following the background simulations , the corresponding sensitivities and grb detection rates",
    "are calculated based on the given observations",
    ".    concerning the impact of each background component on the instruments , generally , for both grm_nai and eclairs , the cosmic gamma - rays are the most important background source when the earth is outside of the fov , especially in the relatively low energy range .",
    "the albedo gamma - rays are always the most important background source in the relatively high energy range .",
    "the reflected cosmic gamma - rays , which are lower than cosmic gamma - rays in flux and lower than albedo gamma - rays in energy , have the least impact on the instruments , but are still an important component in the low energy range when the earth enters the fov .",
    "for grm_csi , albedo gamma - rays are always the dominant background source .    as for the spectral models used in the simulations",
    ", the limitation lays in the energy range .",
    "eclairs is sensitive from 4 kev to 250 kev and grm is sensitive from 30 kev to 5 mev .",
    "however , the model of moretti2009 was obtained considering the data in the energy range 1.5 - 200 kev .",
    "the model of sazonov2007 is a function of the energy which covers from 25 kev to 300 kev .",
    "only the energy range of the churazov2006 model reaches the mev range . as a result ,",
    "one further work on the gamma - ray background estimations is to find better source models for the wide energy range of svom .",
    "maybe different models should be used for different energy ranges .    in the calculations in section",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] , only gamma - ray background components are considered without including other kinds of backgrounds induced by protons , electrons , positrons , etc . as well as the background produced by the instrument itself .",
    "however , we can not conclude that the value of the grb detection rate is overestimated for this reason . because there are many factors affecting the final results in fact .",
    "for example , to compute the sensitivity values in table 2 accurately , the efficiency corresponding to different incident directions of photons from the fov should be considered instead of only the vertical direction .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity used to trigger grbs on board will consider diverse energy ranges , integral time scales and significance levels .",
    "one assumption in our computation is that the satellite has seven states relative to the earth positions and each state lasts 1/7 of the satellite orbit period .",
    "this is a simplification , since the real pointing law on orbit will be more complex . back to our gamma - ray background simulations , the maximum albedo spectrum with the minimum solar modulation 0.25 gv at the highest level orbit position ( 30@xmath0n",
    ", 287@xmath0e ) was used .",
    "accordingly , a more accurate estimation of the grb detection rate needs further work and another article will be prepared .",
