    "2015 ) found similar hardness ratio dependence on x - ray luminosity in six transient x - ray pulsars ( exo 2030 + 375,gx 304 - 1 , 4u 0115 + 63 , v 0332 + 63 , a 0535 + 26 and mxb 0656 - 072 ) .",
    "postnov et al .",
    "( 2015 ) explains this `` saturation '' behaviour of the hardness ratio as a result of @xmath55 surpassing a critical value that leads to an increase in the height of the accretion so that the contribution of the reflected component to the total emission starts decreasing .",
    "but their corresponding critical luminosity is nearly one order higher than our value , being @xmath56 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "maximum value of the pulse fraction obtained from 3 - 16.5 kev _ _ rxte__@xmath0pca observations ( see fig .",
    "[ pf ] ) is @xmath57 which is consistent with the previously reported value ( krimm et al .",
    "2009 ) . in fig .",
    "[ pf ] , the pulsed fraction shows a clear correlation with the source flux , given that higher fractions are observed for higher flux . for higher accretion rates ,",
    "the material pressure of the accreting mass allows the plasma to move in and induces a closer interaction between the plasma and the magnetosphere . consequently , increased efficiency of accretion onto the magnetic poles results in a higher pulsed fraction .",
    "we found that overall _ _ swift__@xmath0xrt and _ _ rxte__@xmath0pca spectrum of swift j0513.46547",
    "is well described with either a power law model with a high energy cut - off at @xmath58 kev or a model consisting of a black body peaking at @xmath59 kev and a power law .",
    "for the overall spectrum , both of these models fit equally well .    if the model consisting of a blackbody component is considered",
    "; not only a quite high value of blackbody temperature ( @xmath59 kev ) , but also the unusually high value of blackbody emitting radius ( @xmath60 km ) makes the model not favorable .",
    "usually such high kt s are observed in the spectra of low luminosity ( @xmath61 erg s@xmath2 ) accreting x - ray pulsars , although there might be exceptions such as sax j 2103.5 + 4545 and swift j045106.8 - 694803 with a source luminosity and black body kt of the order of those of swift j0513.46547 ( bartlett et al .",
    "2013 ; inam et al .",
    "moreover the fraction of blackbody flux contributing to the 0.3 - 10 kev flux is rather low as about 30 per cent of the unabsorbed flux . on the other hand ,",
    "if the model including a power law with high energy cut - off is considered , high energy cut - off is a usual spectral feature that is observed in many of the hmxbs .",
    "even if the cut - off energy @xmath62 kev measured for swift j0513.46547 is at the lowest end of the range of energies measured for other sources ( e.g. for 4u 162667 @xmath63 kev , see coburn et al . 2002 ) , we still prefer to represent the individual spectra with this model .    from fig .",
    "[ spe2009 ] , there is a marginal evidence that the decrease in x - ray flux leads to a softening of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "similar spectral dependence which might be an indication of accretion geometry changes due to mass accretion rate variations was also found for the x - ray pulsars sax j2103.5 + 4545 ( baykal et al .",
    "2002 ) , 2s 1417 - 62 ( inam et al . 2004b ) , xmmu j054134.7 - 682550 ( inam et al .",
    "2009 ) , her x-1 ( klochkov et al . 2011 ) and swift j1626.6 - 5156 ( icdem , inam and baykal 2011 ) .",
    "we also studied pulse phase resolved spectra of the source using _ _",
    "rxte__@xmath0pca observations of 2009 .",
    "as seen from fig .",
    "[ phasespe ] , the peaks have similar photon index values of @xmath64 .",
    "however , the midpoint between primary and secondary peaks at @xmath52 phase has a steeper ( softer ) spectrum with a power law index of 1.48 .",
    "the softening for this phase is also evident in hr1 hardness ratio shown in fig .",
    "the hardness ratio involving higher energy bands ( i.e. hr2 ) reveals that the spectrum of the primary peak is softer than that of the secondary peak .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the higher energy bands have less count rates , so even modest variations in these energy bands do not affect the power law indices significantly .",
