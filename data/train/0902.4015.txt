    "ls  i  @xmath0  is a be / x - ray binary with spectral type b0 ve , a 26.5 day orbital period , and highly eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "high energy emission from ls  i  @xmath0  was first detected 30 years ago ( as @xmath1-ray source cg 135 + 1 ) by the cosmic ray satellite b @xcite . shortly thereafter , nasa s einstein observatory and ground based radio observations suggested that the system was no ordinary hmxb @xcite . while the system has a relatively low x - ray luminosity for a hmxb , ls  i  @xmath0  is one of the 20 brightest @xmath1-ray sources known .",
    "the be disk interacts with the compact companion , either a neutron star or black hole , producing orbital phase modulated emission across the electromagnetic spectrum : tev @xcite , x - ray @xcite , optical h@xmath2 @xcite , and radio flux @xcite .",
    "ls 5039 is a hmxb that consists of a massive , main sequence primary ( on6.5  v((f ) ) spectral type ; @xcite ) and a compact companion in a tightly bound , eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "optical and uv spectra of the system reveal nitrogen enrichment and carbon depletion at the surface of the o star , a sign of prior mass transfer that inverted the binary mass ratio before the supernova occurred @xcite .",
    "the binary remained bound and was ejected from the galactic plane within the past 1.1 myr in an asymmetric supernova explosion that imparted a runaway velocity of about 150 km  s@xmath3 to the system @xcite . as a hmxb , ls  5039  is quite inconspicuous with a relatively constant , low x - ray flux and hard spectrum ; it does not experience dramatic x - ray flares or state changes that are seen in most other hmxbs .",
    "however , it is an unusually bright radio source for a hmxb @xcite .",
    "the system distinguished itself when it was first noted as a probable @xmath1-ray source by @xcite since it is the only simultaneous x - ray and radio emitter inside the 95% confidence contour of the egret source 3eg j1824@xmath41514 .",
    "its bright and hard @xmath1-ray spectrum suggested that it might be observable by ground - based atmospheric cherenkov telescope arrays , and indeed it was detected with energies @xmath5 tev by the hess array @xcite .",
    "the identification of the @xmath1-ray source with the optical star ls  5039  was strengthened by the @xmath1-ray variability over the 4 day orbital period @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flux is also modulated with the orbital period @xcite .    ls  i  @xmath0  and ls  5039  are two of only five known hmxbs that exhibit very high energy emission in the mev - tev range ( `` @xmath1-ray binaries '' ) ; the others are psr b1259@xmath463 @xcite , cygnus x-1 @xcite , and the recently proposed candidate hess j0632 + 057 @xcite .",
    "the recent launch of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ heralds a new era in the understanding of very high energy emission of these sources , and our group is currently involved in multiwavelength observing campaigns for both systems . in an effort to support these programs , we present here new optical spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements of ls  i  @xmath0  in  2 and ls  5039  in  3 .",
    "we discuss the results and the implications of the new orbits in  4 .",
    "we obtained 83 spectra of ls  i  @xmath0  at the kpno coud feed telescope over 35 consecutive nights during 2008 october and november .",
    "we used grating b in second order with the og550 order - sorting filter and the f3 kb detector .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated using thar comparison lamp spectra taken throughout each night .",
    "this instrumental configuration resulted in a wavelength range of 64007050   with a resolving power @xmath6 ranging from 1140012500 across the chip .",
    "we generally obtained 23 spectra of 30 minutes duration each night .",
    "the images were zero corrected , flat fielded , and wavelength calibrated using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "the spectra were interpolated onto a log wavelength scale using a common heliocentric wavelength grid , and they were rectified to a unit continuum using line - free regions .",
    "our red spectra of ls  i  @xmath0  include only two prominent stellar features , h@xmath2 and @xmath7 , shown in figure [ lsi_mean ] .",
    "the h@xmath2 line is dominated by double - peaked emission from the circumstellar disk of the be star . while the absorption trough does follow the orbital motion of the star , we did not use this line to measure the spectroscopic orbit since its radial velocity , @xmath8 , measurements may be strongly affected by changes in the disk structure . weak emission is also present in the blue and red wings of the @xmath7 line , but it is less affected by temporal changes in the disk . therefore we measured radial velocities of ls  i  @xmath0  using only this line .",
    "we formed a reference spectrum of ls  i  @xmath0 using the mean of all available spectra ( without shifting to their rest velocity to avoid any prior assumptions about the orbit ) , and we measured the @xmath8 of this mean spectrum using a parabolic fit of the @xmath7 line core .",
    "since we were concerned that the emission in the line wings ( rather than the photospheric absorption component ) might affect the relative velocities , we excised the emission on the blue and red wings of the reference spectrum to a unit continuum .",
    "we then performed a cross correlation between each spectrum and this reference spectrum over the @xmath7 line region to obtain the relative @xmath9 , which we added to the @xmath8 of the reference spectrum to obtain the absolute @xmath8 .",
    "we also measured the cross correlation velocity shift of the interstellar line at 6613  , @xmath10 , using the same method to monitor the stability of our measurements . after removing measurements with @xmath11 km",
    "s@xmath3 and spectra in which the @xmath7 line profile was strongly affected by cosmic rays , we present a total of 75 @xmath8 measurements in table [ vr ] .",
    "the orbital period of ls  i  @xmath0  is well known from radio flux observations @xcite , so we adopted the period @xmath12 d from that work .",
    "many recent papers also use an arbitrary orbital phase , @xmath13 , defined to be zero at hjd 2,443,366.775 @xcite , which we adopt as well .",
    "our @xmath8 agree well with @xcite , but measurements from @xcite are systematically lower by 8.8 km  s@xmath3 ( based on the difference in the center of mass velocity , @xmath1 , using each data set separately ) .",
    "this difference is likely due to a small difference in the rest wavelength of that line ; we used 6678.15   as given by the nist atomic spectra database @xcite . therefore we offset their @xmath8 by this amount to determine the orbital elements of ls  i  @xmath0 , and we excluded their points with discrepant @xmath14 values as well . using this edited set of @xmath8 from @xcite , @xcite , and this work , we determined the orbital elements using the non - linear , least - squares fitting program of @xcite .",
    "there are several points with large scatter and a systematic trend in the @xmath8 curve ( discussed in  4 ) , so we assigned zero weight to points with @xmath15 and refit the orbit for the final orbital solution .",
    "the resulting time of periastron , @xmath16 , eccentricity , @xmath17 , angle of the line of nodes , @xmath18 , velocity semiamplitude , @xmath19 , center of mass velocity , @xmath1 , mass function , @xmath20 , projected separation , @xmath21 , and the standard deviation of the fit , @xmath22 , are listed in column 2 of table [ orbit ] .",
    "the final @xmath8 curve is shown in figure [ vrcurve_lsi ] , and the orbital phases ( relative to @xcite ) and observed minus corrected errors ( @xmath23 ) are included in table [ vr ] . with our new orbital fit ,",
    "the orbital phase of periastron is @xmath24 .",
    "the geometry of the orbit is illustrated in figure [ lsi_orbit ] , assuming a be star mass of @xmath25 @xcite with either a neutron star ( @xmath26 ) or a black hole ( @xmath27 ) companion .",
    "except for @xmath1 , each orbital element agrees very well with the values found by @xcite . because our spectra of ls  i  @xmath0  were obtained over 35 consecutive nights , our @xmath8 measurements provide excellent coverage of the orbit with no large gaps in orbital phase , and the errors in our fit are slightly lower than those of @xcite and significantly lower than those of @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that our final orbital solution relies upon the fixed @xmath28 from @xcite , but we found very similar values for each orbital element when we allowed @xmath28 to vary .",
    "we found @xmath29 d using the fitting program of @xcite with the combined @xmath8 data , which is not an improvement over @xcite .",
    "spectra of ls  5039  were taken at the ctio 1.5 m telescope between 2007 august and 2008 april in service mode .",
    "we used grating 47 in the second order , a 200 micron slit , the bg39 filter , and the loral 1k ccd detector .",
    "spectra were wavelength calibrated using hear comparison lamp spectra generally taken before and after each exposure . the observed wavelength region was therefore about 40504700  , with @xmath30 across the chip .    for each night",
    "that we had service time available in fall 2007 , we obtained 4 - 6 spectra , each with an exposure time of 30 minutes . during the spring of 2008",
    ", we obtained 2 spectra each night of observations , each of 22 minutes duration .",
    "thus we obtained a total of 98 blue spectra of ls  5039 .",
    "the images were zero corrected , flat fielded , and wavelength calibrated onto a log wavelength scale using standard procedures in iraf , and all spectra were interpolated onto a common heliocentric wavelength grid .",
    "the spectra were rectified to a unit continuum using line - free regions .    since the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio was somewhat low",
    ", we chose to coadd pairs of consecutive spectra from each night .",
    "the total elapsed time during two consecutive observations is only one hour , about 1% of the orbital period , so coadding the spectra does not significantly affect the measured @xmath8 . on two nights we collected an odd number of spectra , and in these cases the last spectrum of each set was examined individually .",
    "therefore , we had 50 new spectra from which to obtain @xmath8 measurements and improve the orbital elements .",
    "the spectra from august 29 , 2007 were taken near the time of inferior conjunction and thus showed the least variation in @xmath8 , so we chose to average these six spectra to produce a reference spectrum .",
    "this reference spectrum is plotted in figure [ ls5039_mean ] .",
    "five lines were examined in each spectrum : h@xmath1 , h@xmath31 , @xmath324200 , 4542 , and @xmath334471 .",
    "the spectra also recorded the strong @xmath334686 line , but a bad column on the chip interfered with measuring reliable @xmath8 from this line .",
    "we performed a cross correlation between each spectrum and the reference spectrum to obtain its relative @xmath8 , and then we used the mean @xmath8 from a parabolic fit of the line cores in the reference spectrum to find its absolute @xmath8 .",
    "the period of the system was obtained using the discrete fourier transform and clean deconvolution program of @xcite ( written in idl by a. w. fullerton ) .",
    "the @xmath8 from our observations were combined with the mean values from all lines measured by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 measurements of @xcite indicate a value of @xmath1 that is systematically higher than our data sets by 7.0 km  s@xmath3 , so we subtracted this value from their measurements .",
    "no significant difference was found between the @xmath8 data presented here and past measurements obtained by our group .",
    "we used all of the available @xmath8 with the clean algorithm , which found a strong peak at @xmath34 d ( which was improved slightly with the later orbital fit ) , nearly identical to the period found by @xcite .",
    "our group has previously found @xmath35 d @xcite and @xmath36 d @xcite for ls  5039 , due to the very high scatter in its @xmath8 curve , which has lead to considerable confusion about the correct orbital period of this system .",
    "we note that our period search also resulted in @xmath37 d when we excluded the data of @xcite , so we have added confidence that this is indeed the correct period for ls  5039 .",
    "we also investigated other weak frequency signals found by clean , but these periods did not produce a realistic @xmath8 curve .",
    "we determined the remaining orbital elements with the non - linear , least - squares fitting program of @xcite to solve for the orbital elements . with",
    "each point assigned equal weight , the resulting orbital elements are displayed in column 3 of table [ orbit ] .",
    "our times of observations , orbital phases , @xmath8 measurements , and @xmath38 errors are listed in table [ vr ] .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath8 from the mean of all five lines is comparable to the @xmath38 error .",
    "figure [ vrcurve_ls5039 ] illustrates the radial velocity curve using all available @xmath8 measurements .    for our new orbital fit of ls  5039 ,",
    "the geometry is illustrated in figure [ ls5039_orbit ] . in this figure",
    ", we show the relative orbit of the optical star with @xmath39 @xcite and a compact companon . @xcite",
    "have proposed a @xmath40 black hole in the system , although @xcite favors a neutron star ( @xmath26 ) companion .",
    "our orbital solution is not very different from the fit found by @xcite using all available h , , and lines .",
    "however , they adopt a final solution found using only the lines , which results in a slightly higher @xmath17 , @xmath1 , and @xmath19 than our result . their argument that wind emission in the o star may affect the line species differently , whereas the line is formed in the photosphere and is less contaminated by the wind ,",
    "is very reasonable .",
    "however , we did not observe systematic line - to - line differences in our spectra , and the scatter for all lines is equally large .",
    "therefore we favor using the mean of all available lines for the orbital solution of ls  5039 .",
    "both ls  i  @xmath0  and ls  5039  have previously published orbital solutions in the literature with large disagreements in the orbital elements @xcite .",
    "the need for an improved system geometry , especially in ls  i  @xmath0 , was highlighted recently by @xcite because the stellar separation and wind density play a significant role in the location of the @xmath1-ray emission region @xcite and opacities in a pulsar wind zone model .",
    "in fact , they found that a putative wind shock region in ls  i  @xmath0  could lie unphysically close to the optical star using the orbital solution of @xcite along with several assumptions about the stellar and pulsar wind strengths .",
    "our new solution for ls  i  @xmath0  results in a larger separation distance at periastron , so the stand - off distance of the shock region will be correspondingly farther from the star for the same wind parameters . since the @xmath1-ray production and its opacities are very sensitive to the orbital geometry , our spectroscopic orbital solutions of ls  i  @xmath0  and ls  5039  may be further improved and the system inclinations constrained using their mev - tev light curves .",
    "we note that the radial velocity curves of both ls  i  @xmath0  and ls  5039  reveal a large number of spurious @xmath8 points near apastron . in the case of ls",
    "i  @xmath0 , figure [ vrcurve_lsi ] indicates a secondary maximum in the @xmath8 curve near @xmath41 that appears both in our observations and those of @xcite . to examine this behavior more carefully ,",
    "we show in figure [ he6678_gray ] the @xmath7 line profiles and a gray - scale image of this line over our 35 consecutive nights of observation .",
    "some glitches that do not affect the absorption line profile have been removed for clarity .",
    "note that neither the line profiles nor gray - scale plots are folded by orbital phase , but rather they reveal true chronological variations in the line profile behavior as a function of hjd and the corresponding orbital phase .",
    "our spectra between @xmath42(tg)@xmath43 reveal a slight increase in both the red ( @xmath44 ) and violet ( @xmath45 ) emission peaks , followed by a decline in emission between @xmath46(tg ) @xmath47 .",
    "the effect is much more pronounced in the h@xmath2 line profile and was also noted by @xcite . thus the @xmath45 and @xmath44 variations appear to be related to cyclic orbital variations rather than an isolated event .",
    "although one spectrum does contain a sharp glitch in the line core ( not included in our @xmath8 measurements ) , the secondary @xmath8 increase near @xmath48(tg ) @xmath49 is due to the decrease in emission strength and the corresponding broadening of the absorption line profile .    in ls  5039",
    ", most of the spurious points in the @xmath8 curve occur between @xmath50 , and they have been observed by other authors as well @xcite .",
    "in fact , the frequent deviations in @xmath8 are the main source of confusion in the orbital elements published by these authors",
    ". our low spectral resolution does not permit a detailed analysis of the line behavior at this time , but higher resolution spectra may provide evidence of systematic line profile changes in the system .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the anonymous referee for helpful comments about this manuscript as well as jorge casares for sharing his radial velocity measurements of ls 5039 .",
    "we also thank di harmer and the staff at kpno , as well as fred walter and the smarts service observers , for their hard work to schedule and support these observations .",
