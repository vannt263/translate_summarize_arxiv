    "elastic electron - nucleon scattering in the one - photon exchange approximation is a time - honoured tool to access information on the structure of hadrons .",
    "experiments with increasing precision have become possible in recent years , mainly triggered by new techniques to perform polarization experiments at the electron scattering facilities .",
    "this has allowed to reach a new frontier in the measurement of hadron structure quantities , such as its electroweak form factors , parity violating effects , nucleon polarizabilities , @xmath1 transition form factors , or the measurement of spin dependent structure functions , to name a few .",
    "for example , experiments using polarized electron beams and measuring the ratio of the recoil nucleon in - plane polarization components have profoundly extended our understanding of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors . for the proton , such polarization experiments which access the ratio @xmath2 of the proton s electric ( @xmath3 ) to magnetic ( @xmath4 ) form factors",
    "have been performed out to a momentum transfer @xmath5 of 5.6 gev@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it came as a surprise that these experiments extracted a ratio of @xmath2 which is clearly at variance with unpolarized measurements @xcite using the rosenbluth separation technique .",
    "the understanding of this puzzle has generated a lot of activity recently , and is a prerequisite to use electron scattering as a precision tool .",
    "it has been suggested on general grounds in ref .",
    "@xcite that this puzzle may be explained by a two - photon exchange amplitude of the level of a few percent",
    ". the resulting failure of the one - photon exchange approximation to unpolarized elastic electron - nucleon scattering can be understood from the observation that @xmath4 and @xmath3 enter quadratically in the unpolarized cross section .",
    "it turns out that @xmath7 may become a small quantity compared with @xmath8 , and is further suppressed by a kinematical factor @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , it becomes increasingly difficult to extract this term at larger momentum transfer . already at moderate momentum transfers",
    ", the weight of the term proportional to @xmath10 drops at the 1 % level and one may expect that correction terms due to two - photon exchange become competitive and eventually dominate over the @xmath10 term .",
    "the polarization transfer method on the other hand is much less affected because it directly measures the ratio of @xmath2 , i.e. depends linearly on @xmath11 .",
    "recently , several model calculations of the @xmath12 exchange amplitude have been performed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a calculation of the @xmath12 exchange when the hadronic intermediate state is a nucleon was performed .",
    "it found that the @xmath12 exchange correction with intermediate nucleon can partially resolve the discrepancy between the two experimental techniques .",
    "recently , the @xmath12 exchange contribution to elastic electron - nucleon scattering has been estimated at large momentum transfer  @xcite , through the scattering off a parton in a proton by relating the process on the nucleon to the generalized parton distributions .",
    "this calculation found that the @xmath12 exchange contribution is indeed able to quantitatively resolve the existing discrepancy between rosenbluth and polarization transfer experiments . to push the precision frontier",
    "further in electron scattering , one needs a good control of @xmath12 exchange mechanisms and needs to understand how they may or may not affect different observables .",
    "this justifies a systematic study of such @xmath12 exchange effects , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the real ( dispersive ) part of the @xmath12 exchange amplitude can be accessed through the difference between elastic electron and positron scattering off a nucleon .",
    "the imaginary ( absorptive ) part of the @xmath12 exchange amplitude on the other hand can be accessed through a single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in elastic electron - nucleon scattering , when either the target or beam spin are polarized normal to the scattering plane , as has been discussed some time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . as time",
    "reversal invariance forces this ssa to vanish for one - photon exchange , it is of order @xmath13 . furthermore , to polarize an ultra - relativistic particle in the direction normal to its momentum involves a suppression factor @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 the mass and @xmath16 the energy of the particle ) , which typically is of order @xmath17 when the electron beam energy is in the 1 gev range .",
    "therefore , the resulting target normal ssa can be expected to be of order @xmath18 , whereas the beam normal ssa is of order @xmath19 .",
    "a measurement of such small asymmetries is quite demanding experimentally .",
    "however , in the case of a polarized lepton beam , asymmetries of the order ppm are currently accessible in parity violation ( pv ) elastic electron - nucleon scattering experiments .",
    "the parity violating asymmetry involves a beam spin polarized along its momentum .",
    "however the ssa for an electron beam spin normal to the scattering plane can also be measured using the same experimental set - ups .",
    "first measurements of this beam normal ssa at beam energies below 1 gev have yielded values around 10 ppm  @xcite . at higher beam energies , the beam normal ssa can also be measured in upcoming pv elastic electron - nucleon scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "first estimates of the target normal ssa in elastic electron - nucleon scattering have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in those works ,",
    "the @xmath12 exchange with nucleon intermediate state ( so - called elastic or nucleon pole contribution ) has been calculated , and the inelastic contribution has been estimated in a very forward angle approximation .",
    "estimates within this approximation have also been reported for the beam normal ssa in ref .",
    "recently , the general formalism for elastic electron - nucleon scattering with lepton helicity flip , which is needed to describe the beam normal ssa , has been developed in ref .",
    "furthermore , the beam normal ssa has also been estimated at large momentum transfers @xmath5 in ref",
    ".  @xcite using a parton model , which was found crucial @xcite to interpret the results from unpolarized electron - nucleon elastic scattering , as discussed before . in the handbag model of refs .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding @xmath12 exchange amplitude has been expressed in terms of generalized parton distributions , and the real and imaginary part of the @xmath12 exchange amplitude are related through a dispersion relation . hence in the partonic regime , a direct comparison of the imaginary part with experiment can provide a very valuable cross - check on the calculated result for the real part . to use the elastic electron - nucleon scattering at low momentum transfer as a high precision tool , such as in present day pv experiments",
    ", one may also want to quantify the @xmath12 exchange amplitude .",
    "to this aim , one may envisage a dispersion formalism for the elastic electron - nucleon scattering amplitudes , as has been discussed some time ago in the literature  @xcite . to develop this formalism , the necessary first step is a precise knowledge of the imaginary part of the two - photon exchange amplitude , which enters in both the beam and target normal ssa .",
    "the study of this imaginary part of the @xmath12 exchange is the subject of this paper . using unitarity",
    ", one can relate the imaginary part of the @xmath12 amplitude to the electroabsorption amplitudes on a nucleon . when measuring the imaginary part of the elastic electron - nucleon amplitude through a normal ssa at sufficiently low energies , below or around two - pion production threshold , one is in a regime where these electroproduction amplitudes are relatively well known using pion electroproduction experiments as input .",
    "one strategy is therefore to investigate this new tool of beam and target normal ssa first in the region where one has a good first knowledge of the imaginary part of the @xmath12 exchange .",
    "as both photons in the @xmath12 exchange process are virtual and integrated over , an observable such as the beam or target normal ssa is sensitive to the electroproduction amplitudes on the nucleon for a range of photon virtualities .",
    "this may provide information on resonance transition form factors complementary to the information obtained from current pion electroproduction experiments .",
    "finally , by understanding the @xmath12 exchange contributions for the case of electromagnetic electron - nucleon scattering , one may extend this calculation to electroweak processes , where the @xmath20 and @xmath21 box diagrams are in several cases the leading unknown contributions entering in electroweak precision experiments .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the elastic electron - nucleon scattering formalism beyond the one - photon exchange approximation in section  [ sec : en ] , and discuss the target and beam normal spin asymmetries in section  [ sec : ssa ] .",
    "subsequently , we study the imaginary part of the two - photon exchange amplitudes in section  [ sec : impart ] .",

    "[ sec : models ] , we use unitarity to model the doubly virtual compton scattering tensor in the resonance region in terms of @xmath0 electroabsorption amplitudes .",

    "<S> we discuss the target and beam normal spin asymmetries in elastic electron - nucleon scattering which depend on the imaginary part of two - photon exchange processes between electron and nucleon . </S>",

    "<S> we use unitarity to model the doubly virtual compton scattering tensor in the resonance region in terms of @xmath0 electroabsorption amplitudes . taking those amplitudes from a phenomenological analysis of pion electroproduction observables , we present results for beam and target normal single spin asymmetries for elastic electron - nucleon scattering for beam energies below 1 gev and in the 1 - 3 gev region , where several experiments are performed or are in progress .    _ </S>",
