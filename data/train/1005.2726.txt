    ". this discrepancy may be the result of the strange quark at one of the ends , since the @xmath110 and @xmath104 mesons that mainly decay into strange mesons had shown further larger deviation ( not plotted ) .",

    "the other solutions , i.e. the higher energy solution of eq.([l3s1 ] ) ( @xmath132 ) and the state ( [ a2a1 - 2 ] ) ( abnormal @xmath133 ) , does not seem to have corresponding particles experimentally so far .",
    "this absence seems to be because these energy regions are not well explored .",
    "we did not tried to identify the states in that the pair of quark spins form a spin @xmath134 representation , since they are three times numerous theoretically and experimentally making it difficult to identify the correspondence , and we wanted to stay the safer side .",

    "may further improve the agreement .",
    "in this paper , we presented a method to quantize the string action .",

    "a trivial extension is applying it to closed strings .",
    "there is no obstacle in that .",
    "emergence of a closed string is inevitable since the ends of a open string can merge by a pair annihilation of the quarks for the isospin @xmath105 states .",
    "the @xmath135 meson may be the ground state of the closed string .",
    "further , it would not be difficult to quantize a string with a heavy particle at one of the ends .",
    "then the spectra of the heavy - quark mesons wo nt be difficult to obtain .",
    "it would also not be difficult to quantize nambu - goto action for three - armed ( trident - like ) string , and the baryon spectra can be obtained .",
    "supersymmetrized strings are also possible in our formalism though we do nt have to reduce the dimension to 10",
    ". it may be one of ways to introduce a massless spin-2 particle , i.e.  graviton .",
    "it seems also possible to quantize extended objects in any dimension such as membranes .",
    "our formula is showing agreements and similarities with the effective string theory .",
    "the effective string theory considers long string , in which problem of conformal anomaly can be evaded , as an effective theory of qcd strings . in our theory ,",
    "a long string may be considered to be a highly excited state in a direction , say @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the mean length .",
    "the mass is roughly @xmath138 .",
    "let us suppose that we have further @xmath55 excitations that are perpendicular .",
    "our formula ( [ l0 ] ) and @xmath139 gives a formula for the squared mass @xmath94 .",
    "it may be rewritten as p^2 = r^2 + n - a - 1p^2 _ m l_-m l_m + o(1/r^4 ) . putting this formula itself into @xmath94 , taking a square root of the both sides and expanding , we get p = r + n - a 2 r - 12 r^3 ( _ m l_-m l_m + ( n - a)^2/4)+ . this agrees with lscher and weisz s result@xcite , which is an effective string theory in static gauge , on that the second correction is @xmath140 correction and its factor @xmath141 is related to the second term of the expansion of nambu - goto action , i.e.  @xmath142 .",
    "further it agrees that a split of energy by the angular momentum starts at this order .",
    "thus similarity is clear ; however , the argument above still does not completely reproduce fixed boundary condition of open strings or periodic boundary condition into elongated direction , which are typically used in the effective string theory .",
    "therefore further elaboration is needed to see the agreement in detail .",
    "our method of quantization by euler - lagrange equations of motion is a well - defined and consistent way , then it may also serve as a mathematical definition of quantum field theories .    a problem that should be worked out in the future is construction of the interaction vertices and showing its s - duality .",
    "here we succeeded in quantizing the string , and the light - meson spectra were accounted .",
    "this method will be further useful in elucidating physics of gauge symmetric systems .",
    "let us slightly shift our understanding or view about what quantization is .",
    "this new method is equivalent to canonical quantization in ordinary systems but gives slightly different results in constrained systems .    in the canonical quantization , we first determined the representation by setting the commutation relations and then derived the equations of motion in heisenberg picture",
    ". we easily see below that the inverse is possible and equivalent , i.e. we may first give the equations of motion and can derive the commutation relations .",
    "now let us define quantization as :    quantization is finding a nontrivial representation of a non - commutative algebra in which all the equations of motion hold as operator equations .",
    "then , for a non - constrained system , its quantization was complete if you can find such a space in that all the states obey the equations of motion @xmath143|*\\ > = 0\\ ] ] in heisenberg picture .",
    "let us see that this modified method of quantization is equivalent to the conventional one , for example , in the free scalar field theory @xmath144 as follows .",
    "the equation of motion for this lagrangian is ( _ 0 ^ 2 - _ i^2 ) ( x ) = - m^2 ( x ) .",
    "[ phi-3 ] according to our definition , quantization is requiring the equation of motion ( [ phi-3 ] ) to be an operator equation .",
    "for the operator equations , there should exist a solution @xmath145 , which is written in terms of @xmath146 variables @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "now let us consider a commutator @xmath149 \\equiv   i\\delta ( x , x'),\\ ] ] which , by definition , obeys ( _ 0 ^ 2 - _",
    "i^2 + m^2 ) ( x , x ) = 0 .",
    "[ 1 ] we would like to find minimally nontrivial algebra consistent with our definition except for the obvious and trivial solution @xmath150 , which corresponds to the classical field theory .",
    "now we have @xmath151 because of translation invariance , and from eq.([1 ] ) we have @xmath152 where @xmath153 was required since @xmath154 must be an odd function , and @xmath155 is an undetermined factor of dimension zero , which can be a operator . let us suppose that this dimension zero operator , which is translation invariant , is a c - number . differentiating the fourier invert : @xmath156 by time and setting @xmath157 , we obtain [ ( t , x ) , ( t , x ) ] = c ^3(x - x ) .",
    "[ phicomm ] the undetermined factor @xmath155 can be absorbed into a rescale of the field .",
    "therefore this undeterminedness does not matter .",
    "please note that @xmath155 could have been dependent on @xmath158 , which possibility was turned down by lorentz invariance of the system . therefore requiring adequate symmetry",
    "is a part of the definition .",
    "the representation of this system follows this commutation relation ( [ phicomm ] ) .",
    "first , define annihilation operators and creation operators as linear combinations of @xmath159 and @xmath160 , then define the vacuum as a_k|0 = 0 for all @xmath161 . then all the other states are defined by operating creation operators on this vacuum .",
    "this forms a representation for the algebra defined by the equation of motion . in short ,",
    "we have usually started with the commutation relation , e.g.  ( [ phicomm ] ) , and derived equation of motion in heisenberg picture . now we see that , starting from the equation of motion , we can derive the commutation relation inversely .    a constrained system is a system that does not have as many time derivatives @xmath162 as the number of the configuration variables @xmath163 in the lagrangian , and then have difficulty in moving to canonical formalism .",
    "the simplest example of constrained systems is @xmath164 , in which the canonical momentum @xmath165 .",
    "such a condition for canonical variables as this @xmath166 is called a `` constraint '' .",
    "now let us define quantization , allowing for constrained systems , as :    [ quant ] quantization is finding a nontrivial representation of a non - commutative algebra in which all the equations of motion and the constraints hold as operator equations .    here",
    "the representation should conform to the naturally expected symmetries such as poincare invariance , gauge symmetry .",
    "treating the equations of motion and constraints on an equal footing is natural because they come out on an equal footing in the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "we already reported @xcite that this method successfully quantized non - abelian gauge fields , which are constrained systems , without any additional trick of gauge fixing and brst formalism .",
    "further , the treatment of first - class systems becomes simpler in our formalism .",
    "there were complication coming from indeterminacy , which is the defining feature of the first - class constrained systems , and we had to handle it with gauge fixing and faddeev - popov determinant .",
    "now we do nt have to do anything with the indeterminacy , which is same as that we did nothing with the indeterminacy of gauge in classical electrodynamics and all the solution that conformed to the equations of motion were equivalent physically .",
    "not only our method can treat constrained systems and nonconstrained systems in the same way , our method can also treat constrained systems of the first and the second class in an equal way in contrast to dirac s prescription@xcite , which is considered to be the standard way to do with the constrained systems .",
    "the second - class systems had to be treated differently because the second - class constraints are incompatible with the canonical commutation relation .",
    "let us see how the trouble with the second - class systems was solved in the simplest example .",
    "for a nonconstrained system @xmath167 , our quantization method gives operator equations : & & p = -x , + & & x = p , and their solution exists as @xmath168 . let us consider a commutator @xmath169 \\equiv   c(t , 0).\\ ] ] from definition , we have @xmath170 and then [ x(t ) , x(0 ) ] c(t ) = const .",
    "thus this system can have a nonvanishing commutation relation .",
    "in contrast , considering the simplest second - class system @xmath171 , we have x| * = 0 , + p| * = 0 , as equations of motion , and they naturally leads to [ x , p ] = 0 without any additional assumption .",
    "the trouble of requiring different method for the second - class constrained systems was because canonical commutation relation was introduced first and then the constraints were imposed in the dirac s method .",
    "our method has imposed the constraints first , then commutation relations are determined consequently . ]",
    "our formalism fit into the place of equation of motion in classical mechanics ( figure.[fig : eqmot ] ) .",
    "in classical mechanics , the equations of motion were first there , and lagrange s formalism and hamilton s formalism ( canonical formalism ) were invented later . if one wanted to move from lagrange s formalism to canonical formalism , we once deduce euler - lagrange s equations of motion and then canonical formalism was derived .",
