    "the most thoroughly studied scenarios involve baryon production from cp - violating non - equilibrium processes during the electroweak phase transition , from decays of right - handed neutrinos , or from the coherent evolution of scalar fields  @xcite , while the dm relic density is determined by thermal freeze out when a non - relativistic stable species falls out of equilibrium  @xcite . in this context",
    ", there is no reason to expect similar cosmological densities of baryons and dm .",
    "this apparent coincidence may instead be a clue that both types of matter have a common origin .",
    "several models of asymmetric dark matter  ( adm ) have been proposed along these lines where the dm density carries a net ( approximately ) conserved global charge shared by the sm  @xcite , such as baryon number @xmath7 .",
    "these models generally fall into two classes depending on how the charge asymmetry is created :    1 .",
    "an initial charge asymmetry , generated in either the visible or dm sector , is partitioned between the two sectors by chemical equilibration through a transfer operator  @xcite .",
    "these charges are separately `` frozen in '' once the transfer operator goes out of equilibrium .",
    "2 .   non - equilibrium dynamics generate equal and opposite charge asymmetries in the visible and dm sectors , without any net overall charge asymmetry  @xcite . in order to avoid washout , transfer operators must always be out of equilibrium once the asymmetries are created .",

    "our main conclusions are : ( i ) due to different kinematics of ind , compared to standard nucleon decay , existing bounds do not apply over most of the region of parameter space of our dm model , and ( ii ) the effective nucleon lifetime can be around @xmath28 years , if the new physics scale @xmath29 in eq .",
