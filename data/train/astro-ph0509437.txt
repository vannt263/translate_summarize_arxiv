    "magnetic fields are responsible for many aspects of plasma inflow and outflow in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "magnetic fields provide outward angular momentum transport in the accretion process via magnetorotational instability , with accompanied dissipative heating that allows further mass - inflow .",
    "strong poloidal magnetic fields are thought to thread centrifugal winds , which could carry away angular momentum , while confining and collimating large - scale outflows and jets seen in many agns .",
    "the existence of broad - line region in agns may be provided namely by magnetic pressure .",
    "fig.1 shows a remarkable variety of structure of typical agn nearest region including accretion disk , disk corona , wind stream lines , etc .",
    "first part of our paper is including the short description of new method of determination of magnetic fields developed in the pulkovo observatory .",
    "the main idea of this method is taking into account the faraday rotation of the polarization plane in the mean free path of electron ( thomson ) scattering . in a result",
    "a nontrivial wavelength dependence of polarization arises when the faraday rotation angle @xmath0 at the thomson depth @xmath1 ( see gnedin and silantev 1997 )    @xmath2    is sufficiently large . here , @xmath3 is the radiation wavelength and @xmath4 is the angle between the line of sight and magnetic field b. we present the results of calculations of polarized radiation of the accretion disk and accretion outflow near a supermassive black hole which is thought to be in the centre of agns .    the text of this paper is also including the brief review of results of polarimetric observations of agns and qsos .",
    "the basic new our idea is to use the future precise measurements of magnetic fields of agns and qsos for investigating of various cosmological models and especially for determination of the equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy .",
    "the main method for solving this problem is determination of magnetic field of extragalactic radio structures using their synchrotron spectra in the region of synchrotron self - absorption . in this case",
    "the magnetic field magnitude depends very strongly on the value of photometric distance .",
    "the last one depends in this turn on the real cosmological model .",
    "it appears that the magnetic field strength of the given source can be different in many times for various cosmological models .",
    "thus we are obtaining the new method that allows us to make the decisive choice between numerous cosmological models .",
    "we expect that this method could have more advantage over the modern classical sne and wmap methods .",
    "fig.2 presents the results of spectropolarimetric observations of the sample of extragalactic targets chosen by cabanac et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from veron - cetti and veron ( 2000 ) and the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the targets included the bright extragalactic sources having higher probability to show stronger polarization : bal quasars and red quasars .",
    "the selection criteria of the sample were detailed by hutsemekers et al .",
    "2001,2005 . to avoid possible contaminations from the interstellar medium of the galaxy only the objects at galactic latitude @xmath5 grad were selected . above this galactic latitude",
    "the interstellar polarization is smaller .",
    "this sample spans the redshift range @xmath6 homogeneously .",
    "fig.2 shows the dependence of the quasar sample polarization on redshift .",
    "overall the quasar polarization degrees do not correlate with redshift though the slight enhancement of highly polarized quasars at lower redshift seems to be real .",
    "fig.2 ( right panel ) presents the histograms of the linear polarization degree of the quasar sample ( black line ) and of the star sample selected over the same region ( grey line ) are superimposed .",
    "both panels are used from cabanac et al .",
    "the star polarization histogram shows much smaller polarization degrees to that which corresponds to minor contamination from the interstellar polarization .",
    "decreasing the number of polarized quasars with increasing polarization degree may be interpreted as the effect of depolarization due to magnetic faraday effect .",
    "hutsemekers and lamy , 2001 , and hutsemekers et al .",
    "2005 discovered coherent orientations of quasar polarization vectors on cosmological scales .",
    "it appears that quasar polarization vectors are not randomly oriented over the sky with a probability often excess of 99.9% .",
    "the polarization vectors appear coherently oriented or aligned over huge ( @xmath7 gpc ) regions of the sky located at both low ( @xmath8 ) and high ( @xmath9 ) redshifts and characterized by different preferred directions of the quasar polarization ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the left panel shows a map of the polarization vectors .",
    "the right panel shows the logarithmic significance level of the coherent orientation for the sample of 213 polarized quasars .",
    "hutsemekers et al.(2005 ) claimed existence a regular alternance along the line of sight of regions of randomly and aligned polarization vectors with typical commoving length scale of 1.5 gpc .",
    "furthermore , the mean polarization angle seems to rotate with redshift at the rate of @xmath10 per gpc .",
    "they excluded the effect of contamination by interstellar polarization in our galaxy .",
    "though it is not possible to exclude the intrinsic quasar origin of this alignment , the other possibility is that both the polarization vector alignments and the rotation of the mean polarization angles are due to a physical mechanism which affects the light on its travel on the line of sight . such mechanism was considered by gnedin 1994 and by gnedin and krasnikov 1992 and it consists in photon - pseudoscalar mixing within a magnetic field .",
    "mixing process produces light polarization in an external magnetic field .",
    "the coupling between electromagnetic and pseudoscalar fields affects the polarization properties of the electromagnetic waves as they propagate through a magnetic field .",
    "the value of linear polarization due to magnetic conversion of photons into pseudoscalar bosons is derived by the expression :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the perpendicular component of a magnetic field , @xmath4 is the angle between the photon propagation and magnetic field directions , l is the characteristic dimension of a magnetic field , @xmath13 is the photon - pseudoscalar coupling constant .",
    "the alignment effect requires existence of regular magnetic field on the cosmological scales @xmath7 gpc with the magnetic field strength at the level of @xmath14 ng .",
    "there is now evidence of existence of such huge magnetic fields on cosmological scales ( blasi and olinto , 1999 , dar and de rujula , 2005 ) .",
    "this evidence was obtained via observations of faraday rotation of light from distant qsos .",
    "the existing magnetic field of the astrophysical object is the additional factor in optical anisotropy of a surrounding this object plasma .",
    "the radiation of such object acquires linear polarization as a result of scattering on electrons .",
    "the scattered radiation undergoes faraday rotation by propagation in magnetized plasma .",
    "the angle of faraday rotation @xmath0 is determined by the expression ( 1 ) .",
    "the integral linear polarization of light occurs even for a spherically symmetric density distribution of electrons if the magnetic field has no axial symmetry coinciding with the line of sight .",
    "fig.4 demonstrates action of this effect .",
    "the radiation only scattered in equatorial volumes is polarized because faraday rotation angle is negligible for radiation direction across magnetic force lines .",
    "another important effect is the polarization of radiation scattered from an accretion disk that also undergoes to faraday rotation and faraday depolarization .",
    "photons escape the optically thick disk basically from the surface layer with @xmath15 .",
    "if the faraday rotation angle corresponding to this optical length becomes greater than unity , then the emerging radiation will be depolarized as a result of the summarizing radiation fluxes with different angles of faraday s rotation . only for directions that are perpendicular to the vertical magnetic field",
    "the faraday rotation angle is too small to yield depolarization effect .",
    "certainly , the diffusion of radiation in the inner part depolarizes it even without magnetic field because of multiple scattering of photons .",
    "the faraday rotation only increases the depolarization process .",
    "it means that the polarization of outgoing radiation acquires the peak - like angular dependence with its maximum for the direction perpendicular to magnetic field .",
    "the sharpness of the peak increases with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "the main region of allowed angles appears to be @xmath16 , where the parameter depolarization :    @xmath17    fig.5 shows the dependence of the polarization degree of outgoing radiation from magnetized optically thick plasma disk .",
    "the maximum value of polarization is equal to 9.14% instead of the classical value 11.7% corresponding to multiple electron scattering without magnetic field .",
    "the results of our calculations ( see gnedin et al.2005 ) polarization for the various models of optically thick accretion disk with vertically averaged magnetic field are presented by the table 1 .",
    ".degree of polarization for the various models of an accretion disk with vertically averaged magnetic field .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the table 3 the results of calculations of magnetic field strength for the number of the gps sources are presented for the cosmological models with different deceleration parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the scaling linear dimension of radio region @xmath19 is chosen as @xmath20 pc .",
    "our results allows to determine the magnitude of magnetic field in the close vicinity of the supermassive black hole horizon .",
    "if one suggests the conservation of the magnetic flux one can estimate this magnitude .",
    "the data of the table 3 show that this magnitude can reach the value @xmath21 g at the horizon of a supermassive black hole .",
    "the alignment of the polarization vectors of agns and qsos discovered by hutsemekers and their colleagues may be explained as the effect of conversion of photons into pseudoscalar bosons in the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "polarimetric observations in optical range and radio spectral observations of agns and qsos allow us to measure the magnetic field magnitudes .",
    "it is interesting that the magnetic field strength determined from radio spectrum in the model of synchrotron self - absorption mechanism appears to be strongly dependent on the cosmological model .",
    "it means that magnetic measurements are presented a new test for exploration of cosmological models and for determination of the basic parameters of dark matter and dark energy .",
