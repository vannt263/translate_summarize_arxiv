    "there is overwhelming evidence that sagittariusa * ( sgra * ) , the extremely compact radio source at the center of our galaxy , is associated with a super - massive black hole .",
    "it shows sudden bursts of radiation ( called flares ) a few times per day , which are thought to be related to the guzzling of gas and dust from its environment and which can be detected in x - ray and near infra - red ( nir ) regime ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . to search for correlated short term variability and to investigate the flares in as many wavebands as possible , a world wide radio  sub - mm ",
    "x - ray observing campaign on sgra * has been carried out in may 2007 , making use of many telescopes including in the radio bands the vlba ( very long baseline array ) , gmva ( the global millimeter vlbi array ) , carma ( combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ) , atca ( australia telescope compact array ) , iram ( institut de radio astronomie millimetrique ) , and effelsberg .",
    "the vlba observed sgra * at 22 , 43 , and 86ghz on 10 consecutive days .",
    "these data are used to measure the source size and to search for possible deviations from point - like ( or symmetric ) structure , and variations of the source on time scales of @xmath0 1 week .",
    "since the intrinsic source size and shape is masked by the interstellar scattering at centimeter wavelengths , the combination of our 3 observing frequencies is of great importance for the size determination and is crucial for discriminating interstellar broadening from the source intrinsic structure of sgra * by the known scattering law ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we show and discuss preliminary images obtained with the vlba at the 3 frequencies and focus our discussion on the results mainly obtained at 43ghz .",
    "other results regarding to the total flux density measurements in this global campaign are presented in other papers ( see kunneriath _ et al _ , eckart _ et al _ , this conference ) .",
    "the observations were performed with the vlba on 10 consecutive days during may 15 - 24 , 2007 at 22 , 43 , and 86ghz , respectively .",
    "each station recorded dual polarization with a sample rate of 512mbps ( 8 intermediate frequency ( if ) channels , 16mhz per if , and 2bits per sample ) . in",
    "the frequency switching more vlbi time was spent at the shorter wavelength .",
    "bright quasars ( nrao530 , pks1749 + 096 , 3c279 ) served as amplitude calibrators and fringe tracers .",
    "the sio maser in vxsgr ( transitions @xmath1=1 , @xmath2=1,0 and @xmath2=21 ) was observed in interleaved short vlbi scans at 43 and 86ghz in order to complement the regular system temperature measurements for an improved amplitude calibration .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba aoc correlator in socorro , nm , usa with 1s integration time .",
    "the data were analyzed in aips using the standard algorithms including phase and delay calibration and fringe fitting .",
    "the amplitude calibration was performed with the measurements of the antenna gain and system temperatures for each station .",
    "atmospheric opacity corrections were applied using the aips task `` apcal '' .",
    "images of sgra * were finally produced using the standard hybrid mapping methods at all three frequencies . in figure  1",
    ", we show as example the first epoch resulting hybrid images at each frequency .",
    "table  1 parameters these images . during the imaging process",
    ", we verified correctness of the station gain calibration by comparing the amplitude calibration of sgra * with those of nrao530 , vxsgr , and pks1749 + 096 .",
    "here we show preliminary results from ongoing analysis . as shown in figure  1 ( right - hand panel ) ,",
    "all the images show emission east - west oriented along a pa of @xmath0 80@xmath3 .",
    "we find no evidence for a significant deviation of the closure phase from zero within @xmath4 at the three frequencies .",
    "the 43ghz data are very well fitted by a single elliptical gaussian component .",
    "these models are given in table  2 .",
    "the apparent source size at 43ghz ( and thus the intrinsic size for an assumed stable scattering model , no variations of the ism ) appears to be constant on a time scale of 10days and remains even unchanged after a decade of observation , when compared to the data of the last 15years ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) despite a refractive timescale of the scattering medium of less than 1year . from the average overall observing epochs , we obtained the following mean source parameters : @xmath5 = 0.71 @xmath6 0.01 mas , ratio = 0.55 @xmath6 0.01 , and pa = 79.6 @xmath6 0.3@xmath3 .",

    "the radio ( cm - mm - wavelengths ) flux of sgra * is known to be variable on timescales of months to hours , with variability being more pronounced at shorter wavelengths .",
