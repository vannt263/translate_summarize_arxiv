    "in optical communication fibers , polarization - mode dispersion ( pmd , i.e. , group birefringence ) , chromatic dispersion ( cd ) , and kerr nonlinearity are the well known effects causing signal distortion . in linear region ( i. e. , without kerr nonlinearity ) , the signal distortion due to pmd and cd can be predicted and compensated . on the other hand , in the limit of pure nonlinear effect ( i.e. , without linear effects such as pmd and cd ) ,",
    "the signal amplitude will not be affected and the pulse shape will be unchanged along the fiber . unfortunately both linear and nonlinear effects in real fibers are not negligible . to accurately evaluate the signal distortion , one must treat them simultaneously @xcite-@xcite by solving the coupled nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation ( cnlse ) , which was proposed in 1980 s @xcite and further studied in many publications . for a non - soliton system ,",
    "the cnlse is solved with the step size determined by dispersion length @xmath1 , nonlinear length @xmath2 , as well as the birefringence related parameters such as fiber correlation length ( @xmath3 ) ( the length within which birefringence axes are randomly reoriented ) , beating length @xmath4 ( the length determined by birefringence strength ) , and the pmd parameter @xmath5 ( ps/@xmath6 ) [ 1]-[3 ] . ignoring the birefringence effect , the two dimensional ( 2d ) cnlse can be reduced to one dimensional nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation ( 1d nlse ) , with its step size being only related with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . to efficiently solve the 2d cnlse and 1d nlse ,",

    "the values of @xmath4 ( 10@xmath7100 m ) and @xmath3 ( 0.3@xmath7300 m ) are much smaller than @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( up to hundreds of kilometers ) @xcite . dealing with the rapidly and randomly varying birefringence in the multispan communication fibers , decreasing the computational step size to a very small percentage of @xmath3 and @xmath4 not only needs too much computation but also can not ensure good enough accuracy because of the computational error accumulated in all steps . to efficiently solve the cnlse",
    ", one needs an accurate approach ( or algorithm ) with large enough step size .    in ref .",

    "@xcite can be increased to a scale significantly larger than @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "( detailed value of its step size depends on the interaction between linear and nonlinear effects . )",
    "requirements for this approach are that the circular component of the local birefringence in the fiber is negligible and that the nonlinear kerr effect can be approximated as its statistical average over the poincar@xmath8 sphere ( named manakov - pmd approximation or m - pmd approx in this work ) . like many approaches used to solve 2d cnlse or 1d nlse , another essential feature of ref .",

    "because of this , even in the case of zero birefringence , the step size using approach @xcite is restricted to @xmath11 of @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 , assuming the computational error tolerance is less than 1@xmath12 of the pulse peak ( cf . the results in * [ step_size ] * ) .",
    "the concept of interaction picture ( ip ) was originally used in quantum mechanics .",
    "combined with the fourth - order runge - kutta ( rk4 ) algorithm , the method of rk4 in ip ( rk4ip ) was recently proposed to study the supercontinuum generation in optical fibers ( for 1d field cases ) @xcite . since the ip method does not introduce the error inherent in various ssfms , the computational error of rk4ip is determined by the accuracy of rk4 .    the approach of ref .",

    "@xcite the linear dispersion operator in 1d nlse was required to be constant along the fiber .",

    "@xcite and is further discussed in the appendix for our calculation , we extend the rk4ip approach from 1d nlse to 2d cnlse .",
    "as there is no need to rotate the coordinate system , our approach can be applied to the fibers having the general form of local birefringence .",
    "moreover , it treats the kerr nonlinearity without approximation . with the help of the local error method proposed in @xcite , the local error of our rk4ip",
    "can be improved to @xmath13 , rather than @xmath14 of 1d rk4ip @xcite . as results , for the communication fibers with random birefringence",
