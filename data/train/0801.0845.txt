    "one of the salient features in compactified higher - dimensional field theories is the geometric `` higgs '' mechanism resulting from the dimensional reduction .",
    "if gauge particles can propagate to extra dimensions , the corresponding higher - dimensional gauge fields should be decomposed into normal modes of extra dimensions and then , from the four - dimensional point of view , they can be recast into an infinite tower of massive gauge bosons whose longitudinal degree of freedom is provided by absorbing one of extra spatial components of the field .",
    "this gauge boson mass generation is realized without invoking any scalar higgs fields ; it is essentially geometrical in nature .",
    "it also occurs in compactified higher - dimensional gravity theories the same mass generation mechanism without invoking any fundamental higgs fields .",
    "there , it seems that there is no explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "however , it was shown in the kaluza - klein ( kk ) theory that the spontaneous symmetry breaking certainly occurs @xcite : there exists an infinite - dimensional kac - moody - like symmetry at the 4d lagrangian level , but it is broken down to the 4d translation and internal u(1 ) symmetry by the vacuum configuration @xmath2 , and then the non - zero graviton modes become massive .",
    "though it would be the best to describe the geometric `` higgs '' mechanism by the argument along this line , it seems to be hard to extend the analysis to other more complicated compactified gravity theories .",
    "it is less obvious such analysis is applicable to compactified gauge theories .",
    "recently , an alternative view of this mass generation mechanism is given by @xcite : it is best described by using the hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry in 4d mass spectrum .",
    "the point is that mass eigenfunction for each non - zero kk - mode has its own superpartner .",
    "these functions are defined as eigenfunctions of @xmath3 matrix super - hamiltonian .",
    "therefore it can be explained that @xmath4th kk - mode of the 4d component of the gauge field can absorb as its longitudinal degrees of freedom its partner @xmath4th kk - mode of the extra component of the field , and then @xmath4th gauge boson becomes massive .",
    "in ordinary spontaneously broken gauge theories such as the abelian higgs model , if we work in the @xmath5 gauge it is inevitable to introduce the fictitious particles , i.e. the would - be nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons , so as to maintain the unitarity of the @xmath6-matrix . the scalar component of the massive gauge field , the would - be ng boson , the faddeev - popov ( fp ) ghost and the anti fp ghost are all in degenerate with the same mass - squared @xmath7 .",
    "these spurious degrees of freedom consist of a multiplet , known as the brs quartet @xcite , and do not contribute to the physical amplitude by canceling each other , and then the unitarity of the @xmath6-matrix is maintained .    however , there is no such scalar higgs fields in pure gauge theory with extra compact dimensions , nor in compactified higher - dimensional pure gravity .",
    "thus the unphysical polarization states of higher - dimensional gauge / gravitational fields must be canceled among themselves .",
    "furthermore , in order to realize this cancellation these spurious degrees of freedom must be in degenerate with the same gauge - dependent mass - squared . in view of this",
    ", we have to guarantee at least two things : the first is the same number of degrees of freedom for the unphysical components of 4d gauge / gravitational field and the would - be ng bosons .",
    "these degrees of freedom have to appear in pairs .",
    "the second is the degeneracy of mass , that is , the same @xmath1-dependent pole of the propagators between these pairs . in view of this , it is sufficient to consider pure gauge / gravitational theories up to quadratic order and compute the propagators in @xmath5 gauges",
    ". it should be noted at this stage that , from the knowledge of the supersymmetric structure in the 4d mass spectrum , the mass matrices of these pairs should be given by the @xmath8 super - hamiltonians .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that these free field theories would be invariant under some susy - like transformations generated by supercharges to rotate these unphysical degrees of freedom with different spins .",
    "this is the main subject of this paper .",
    "we study the compactified pure abelian gauge theory and pure gravity to quadratic order of gravitational fluctuations .",
    "we show that these free field theories exhibit residual global susy - like symmetries between the unphysical components of 4d gauge / gravitational fields and the would - be nambu - goldstone bosons , which are one of the extra space components of the higher - dimensional fields . also , we establish new @xmath5 gauges in five - dimensional gravity .",
    "we check its validity by computing the lowest tree - level graviton exchange amplitude .",
    "of course the result does not depend on the gauge parameter @xmath1 .",
    "note that we will not argue with unitarity bounds of some specific models as discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to free field theories .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "this result that the coupling constant for the massive graviton theory @xmath330 is 25% smaller than that of the massless graviton theory @xmath169 yields the different prediction for the bending of light ( photon , whose energy - momentum tensor is traceless ) passing near the sun , whose experimental test ( measurement of deflection angle ) has been performed with the accuracy @xmath3311% to the prediction for the standard general relativity , while the massive graviton theory s prediction is about 25% smaller than that of the massless graviton theory , which contradicts with the measurement .",
    "this difference is caused by the helicity 0 degree of freedom which couples to the trace of an energy - momentum tensor even in the massless limit .    to see this",
