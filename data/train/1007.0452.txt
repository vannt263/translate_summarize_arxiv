    "hidden symmetries defined as symmetries that are lost ( type i ) or gained ( type ii ) as the order of an ode is reduced or as the number of variable of a pde is reduced . hidden symmetries are difficult to evaluate since there are no general direct method for determining them .",

    "you can assume these equations are euler - lagrangian of some variational problems ( with necessary condition ) and construct the variational problems have this equations as euler - lagrangian , using direct method ( this is inverse problem in variational calculus ) .",
    "for such variational problems we ca nt solve them using lie symmetry method ( lie classical method ) , so solve them using this new class of symmetries ( @xmath0-symmetries ) .",
