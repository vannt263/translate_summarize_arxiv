    "indirect evidence for an important low - energy component comes from observations of the interstellar ionization rate .",
    "in particular , observations of the molecule h@xmath4 in diffuse interstellar clouds point to a cosmic - ray induced ionization rate which exceeds by more than an order of magnitude the one which is calculated for the standard cosmic - ray flux thought to be produced by diffuse shock acceleration in supernova remnants ( @xcite ) . however",
    ", neither the nature - electrons or nuclei - nor the spectrum of the low - energy component can be deduced from these observations .",
    "an independent argument for the existence of a significant component of low - energy cosmic - ray nuclei comes from the observed quasi - linear increase of be with metallicity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most compelling indirect observation of this component would be a detection of nuclear @xmath0-ray lines from the galactic disk .",
    "in fact , the strongest lines from the most abundant nuclei are preferentially produced in the cosmic - ray energy range below a few hundred mev in collisions of protons and @xmath5-particles with interstellar matter .",
    "they are expected to be the same as frequently observed from strong solar flares , i.e. lines from the deexcitation of the first few levels in @xmath6c , @xmath7o , @xmath8ne , @xmath9 mg , @xmath10si and @xmath11fe ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite constructed cosmic - ray spectra which produce the observed ionization rate in diffuse clouds by adding a low - energy component to the standard cosmic - ray spectrum . with",

    "besides strong narrow lines the nuclear line emission is composed of broad lines produced by the cosmic - ray heavy - ion component and of thousands of weaker lines which together form a quasi - continuum in the e@xmath12 @xmath2 0.1 - 10 mev range .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate this total nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission from the inner galaxy by making use of the work of @xcite , new developments in nuclear reaction cross sections ( @xcite , @xcite ) and recent observations of cosmic - ray induced high - energy @xmath0-ray emission with fermi - lat ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the possibilities for a detection of this emission with existing and eventual future space - borne @xmath0-ray instruments are discussed .",
    "following the method of @xcite , the interstellar cosmic - ray ( cr ) spectra for the calculation of the nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission have been divided into two distinct components :    \\(1 ) standard crs whose origin and acceleration are widely attributed to massive stars through the action of their stellar winds followed by their explosions as supernova . their composition and energy spectra are relatively well known above several gev per nucleon from direct measurements while the extrapolation to lower energies can be done with propagation and demodulation calculations . an important indirect constraint on the cr spectra above several hundred mev per nucleon is the diffuse interstellar high - energy @xmath0-ray emission due to @xmath3 production and decay .",
    "this emission has been observed from several galactic sources by fermi - lat , as for example from the local gas and dust ( @xcite ) and from the inner galaxy ( @xcite ) which are of particular interest for the present study .",
    "these standard crs produce an ionization rate well below the mean ionization rate deduced from h@xmath4 column densities observed in diffuse molecular clouds .",

    "for this we adopt the values deduced from recent observations of the molecule h@xmath4 in diffuse interstellar clouds pointing to a mean ionization rate of molecular hydrogen of @xmath13 = 3 - 4@xmath1410@xmath15 s@xmath16 ( @xcite ) . another requirement to this component",
    "is that the total interstellar cr spectra stay compatible with the observed cr spectra above 1 gev per nucleon ensuring also that the high - energy @xmath0-ray emissions stay compatible with the above cited fermi - lat observations .      in the most important energy band for comparison with fermi - lat data , between about 1 gev and a few hundred gev per nucleon ,",
    "data from some ten balloon - borne and satellite - borne instruments exist .",
    "we adopted the most recent observations of cr fluxes from the pamela detector onboard the russian resurs - dk1 spacecraft which provides high - precision data for protons and helium nuclei in the rigidity range r @xmath2 1 - 1000 gv ( @xcite ) .",
    "their proton fluxes agree in the kinetic energy range above e @xmath2 30  gev , where solar modulation effects should be negligible , with other recent data typically at the 20% level or better .",

    "these estimations are very uncertain , however , as they neglect the effects of magnetic fields on the cr propagation .",
    "@xcite recently found that magnetic mirroring always dominates over magnetic focusing , implying a reduction of the cr ionization rate in molecular cloud cores by a factor of @xmath23 - 4 .",
    "it would of course be very surprising if the lecr component could be described by a single distribution with one definite spectral shape , index , cutoff energy and composition , and be exclusively composed of nuclei .",
    "however , whatever the nature of lecrs , they can probably be approximated by a combination of the spectra and compositions studied here and we believe that the nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission falls into the range which we have explored and which is presented in figs . [ glcnuc],[fluxes ] .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare our predictions with @xmath0-ray instrument sensitivities .    integrating over the solid angle of the inner galaxy ( 300@xmath45 @xmath46 l @xmath46 60@xmath45 , @xmath47b@xmath47 @xmath46 10@xmath45 ) yields flux values ( in @xmath49 s@xmath16 ) 0.73 times the values presented in fig .",
    "[ fluxes ] .",
    "these values are unfortunately far below the narrow - line sensitivities of spi / integral for diffuse emissions : @xmath25 @xmath14 10@xmath54 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for the 4.4- and 6.1-mev lines with fwhm widths @xmath55e @xmath2100 kev and @xmath22 @xmath14 10@xmath54 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for the 1.63-mev line with @xmath55e @xmath220 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "an important fraction of the 6.1-mev line may be very narrow , if much of the interstellar oxygen is locked up in dust grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "it would result in a sensitivity gain of a factor of 5 at maximum , but even that is still far from the highest estimated fluxes . in summary ,",
    "no constraints on lecrs can be inferred from spi / integral observations of the inner galaxy .",
    "a definite detection of cr - induced nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission or stringent constraints on the nature of lecrs in the case of non - detection has probably to wait for the next - generation telescopes with an expected increase in sensitivity of typically a factor of 10 - 100 .",
    "we therefore compare the calculated fluxes to instrument proposals to the last call ( 2010 ) of esa s 2015 - 2025 cosmic vision program .",
    "of the three instruments with similar estimated sensitivities in the 0.1 - 10 mev range which have been presented we focus on the capsitt proposal ( @xcite ) for which some of us participated substantially in the performance estimates .",
    "the most promising narrow line comparing capsitt sensitivities with the predicted fluxes is the 4.4-mev line , the sensitivity gain for an eventual very - narrow - line component of the 6.1-mev line is less significant for this instrument with an estimated energy resolution at 6 mev of @xmath230 kev . assuming a uniform emission in the defined region , the capsitt 3@xmath56 5-y survey line sensitivity for the 4.4-mev line ( @xmath55e = 100 kev fwhm ) is @xmath27 @xmath14 10@xmath57 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for such an extended emission , using only compton events in the capsitt instrument .",
    "this is at the limit for acr - lecr spectra and would allow detection for sa - lecrs with cutoff energies above 15 mev .",
    "pair - creation events , which have not been considered for the proposal to esa below _ e@xmath1 _",
    "= 10 mev can improve significantly the sensitivity for such extended emissions , increasing e.g. the effective detection area threefold at _ e _ = 5 mev .",
    "this would allow a detection for nearly all considered lecr scenarios .",
    "the broadband 1 - 3 and 3 - 8 mev sensitivities in 5 years amount to @xmath22 @xmath14 10@xmath58 @xmath49 s@xmath16 and @xmath21 @xmath14 10@xmath58 @xmath49 s@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the flux expected from the standard crs alone is already slightly higher than the sensitivity in the 1 - 3 mev band and well above the sensitivity in the 3 - 8 mev band .",
    "a detection looks therefore very promising for all lecr scenarios .",
    "it may , however , be difficult to disentangle from other emissions like inverse compton scattering of cr electrons and unidentified point sources , which probably dominate the diffuse flux of the inner galaxy in the 1 - 10 mev range .",
    "analysis and discussion of the diffuse interstellar emission as measured by spi / integral and by comptel / cgro in this energy range can be found in @xcite .",
    "the nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission has probably a latitude and longitude profile similar to that of the high - energy diffuse emission observed by fermi - lat ( @xcite ) .",
    "this emission is approximately constant along 320@xmath45 @xmath46 l @xmath46 40@xmath45 and concentrated on the galactic plane , where about 60% of the emission is in a band with b = @xmath591.5@xmath45 .",
    "differences may arise because of the metallicity dependence of narrow - line fluxes , which is negligible for @xmath3-decay emission , essentially produced in reactions with ambient h and he .",
    "differences of ionization rates in diffuse interstellar clouds , sometimes observed for sight lines with small angular separation indicate a non - uniform localized distribution of lecrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is not surprising since low - energy particles have shorter ranges than the standard crs resulting certainly also in an inhomogeneous distribution of lecrs in the inner galaxy , concentrated around the acceleration sites .",
    "this would probably affect only slightly the integrated fluxes since they are tied to the mean ionization rate , but the spatial distribution of the nuclear line emission would then be different from the high - energy emission from @xmath3 decay .",
    "these effects would be favorable for an eventual observation by a compton - imaging telescope like capsitt , whose estimated angular resolution at 5 mev ( 0.8@xmath45 ) is about a factor of three better than that of comptel / cgro and spi / integral .",
    "the point - source sensitivities of capsitt in 5 years amount to @xmath22 @xmath14 10@xmath60 @xmath49 s@xmath16 and @xmath23 @xmath14 10@xmath60 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for the 4.4-mev line and the 3 - 8 mev band , respectively .",
    "our calculated fluxes of the 4.4-mev line from the inner galaxy are typically 10 - 10@xmath61 times higher than that .",
    "if e.g. the spatial extension of the inhomogeneities is of the order of the angular resolution , a detection gets very probable . assuming that the large scatter of observed ionization rates in diffuse clouds ( see e.g. @xcite ) reflects the lecr density",
    ", the 4.4-mev flux variations may reach a factor of 10 .",
    "this would be very favorable for a detection by a futur instrument with the characteristics of capsitt .",
    "our calculated fluxes in the 3 - 8 mev band are a factor of 10@xmath61 - 10@xmath18 higher than the point - source capsitt sensitivity , and a concentration of a few percent of this flux in a point source would be detectable . following the scatter of ionization rates , a factor - of - few variations in the fluxes are probable although a non - negligible part of the 3 - 8 mev band is produced by standard crs .",
    "that inevitably would be detected by a futur instrument with good angular resolution .",
    "the presented nuclear line and continuum fluxes from the inner galaxy induced by interactions of crs in the interstellar medium were calculated for a large variety of lecr spectra and composition and it is probable that the real values fall somewhere inside the obtained ranges . the total nuclear @xmath0-ray emission from the inner galaxy is predicted to be in the range ( 0.1 - 2.0 ) @xmath14 10@xmath58 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for the 4.4-mev line , ( 0.1 - 1.0 ) @xmath14 10@xmath58 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for the 6.1-mev line and ( 0.3 - 3.7 ) @xmath14 10@xmath57 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for the 1.63-mev line . for the broad - band emissions we find ( 0.2 - 1.3 ) and ( 0.3 - 2.1 ) @xmath14 10@xmath54 @xmath49 s@xmath16 for the 1 - 3 and 3 - 8 mev bands , respectively . an eventual observation of narrow nuclear @xmath0-ray lines with future @xmath0-ray space telescopes based on actually available technology appears to be in reach for a large range of lecr scenarios , although challenging for scenarios with low energy cutoffs , where fluxes do not exceed a few 10@xmath57 @xmath49 s@xmath16 from the inner galaxy .",
    "it may also be promising for the continuum , especially the 3 - 8 mev continuum flux which exceeds the estimated future instrument sensitivities by up to a factor of 20 .",
    "this is especially true for an instrument with good angular resolution which allows the separation of this emission from other diffuse emissions and a very inhomogeneous spatial distribution of lecrs in the inner galaxy could not be missed by such an instrument .",
