    "human societies tend to hold sets of shared and interrelated beliefs that are not directly or easily accessible to proof or disproof . such sets of beliefs , which will be called faith - based systems ( fbss ) , may include , for example , cultural preferences , personal worldview , and belief or disbelief in one or more supreme beings .",
    "fbss are often highly detailed and tend to be shared within local communities , but are highly diverse among global communities .",
    "dawkins @xcite suggested that the evolution and spread of fbss and other cultural information ( memes ) may be subject to natural selection , noting that both parasites and memes are transmissible between hosts and show heritable variation , creating the potential for competition for survival and reproduction .",
    "while the meme hypothesis has received considerable theoretical attention , there have been few attempts to explicitly model it .",
    "previous models of social transmission @xcite have examined mainly two - state systems ; in such models , agent opinions are considered to be transmissible boolean states .",
    "such boolean state models do not allow for the evolutionary potential of memetic transmission , which may influence final state distribution , or for the potential for a large number of fbss to exist simultaneously in a single social system .",
    "in contrast , fbss can be modelled as continuous states on a binary vector , allowing for memetic evolution among populations of varying fbss .    in this paper an agent - based model of the evolution and spread of fbss in a two - dimensional lattice",
    "is presented .",
    "agent - based models are useful for examining how local properties of individual units interact to produce macroscopic properties of systems , and have been applied in the analysis of social opinion formation @xcite , cultural interactions @xcite , epidemiology and population dynamics @xcite .",
    "the current model explores the development of fbss with evolutionarily relevant properties ( faith , proselytism and mutability ) , in simple , individually varying agents .",
    "mortality and fecundity probability curves for agents are applied based on human population data from the 1990s @xcite .",
    "agents have heritable personality characteristics that affect their susceptibility to conversion and their likelihood of creating a new fbs ; this provides a non - uniform spatial environment for the evolution of fbss .",
    "characteristics of agents modelled are ( cf .  tab .",
    "[ agenttable ] ) resistance ( @xmath0 ) ( the tendency to resist conversion to a different fbs ) , activity ( @xmath1 ) ( the tendency to participate in transmission of fbss ) , charisma ( @xmath2 ) ( ability to convert other agents to their current fbs ) , and imagination ( @xmath3 ) ( the tendency to invent a new fbs based on the existing one ) .",
    "the influence of two factors on the distribution and characteristics of fbss is examined .",
    "the frequency of social interactions of agents , where social interactions offer the potential for conversion between beliefs , seems likely to influence the spread and survival of fbss .",
    "when social interactions are less frequent , pressure for conversion between fbss is likely to be smaller , but social support for existing fbss is also decreased .",
    "if social support plays an important role in preventing conversion , extinction of unsuccessful fbss may occur more quickly when social interactions are less frequent .",
    "this could lead to decreased numbers of fbss , each on average having a larger number of adherents .",
    "additionally , the effect of varying total social network size on fbs evolution is explored .",
    "larger total social network size may increase the influence of the social interaction condition , and may allow a larger number of coexisting fbss and older fbss ( due to lower extinction rates in larger grids ) .",
    "the model initially consists of @xmath4 or @xmath5 agents which are located on a regular rectangular two dimensional lattice with free boundary conditions .",
    "each agent , occupying a single site on the grid , interacts with up to eight social neighbors which are randomly chosen from nearest geometric neighbors ; agents located at the border of the grid have fewer neighbors .",

    "transmission is limited both by the individual resistance of an agent , and by the presence of social support for the agent s current fbs .",
    "this attempts to reflect the interaction of personality and environment in social transmission ; for some individuals , personal characteristics are the main factors preventing conversion , while for others , social support is more important .",
    "new fbss are created randomly with probability dependent on the imagination of the agent and the mutability of its current fbs , e.g. agent @xmath14 can create new fbs with probability @xmath33 .",
    "the new fbs has the same characteristics as the old fbs , with a random increase or decrease by 1 unit to any one of its characteristic values ( proselytism , faith or mutability ) .",
    "this mechanism introduces an evolutionary principle , which allows directed change in fbs characteristics over time .    the probability that a given agent ( e.g. @xmath14 ) is going to participate in social interactions during a given iteration of the model is @xmath34 .",
    "additionally , during each iteration , agents can move to a randomly selected adjacent cell , provided it is empty .",
    "space occupied by agents is limited to the total area of the grid , but the number of agents can vary over time due to mortality and fecundity of individuals .",

    "initially all characteristics were generated as independent and identically distributed random variables , according to the restricted gaussian distribution . over time",

    "the absolute values of other correlations are smaller .",
    "in particular , small negative correlations ( -0.17  -0.08 ) between mutability and the age of fbss , and mutability and the size of fbs were observed .",
    "as mutability increased , both the age and size of fbss decreased ; this is attributed to the increased tendency for agents holding high - mutability fbss to invent new fbss .",
    "smaller negative correlations also occurred between proselytism and age , and proselytism and size .",
    "because of the generally low level of correlation , it is hard to draw any detailed conclusion from these findings .",
    "what is intriguing , however , is an unexpected sign of correlation between age and proselytism , and size and proselytism .",
    "this effect may be caused by the limited size of our random samples or the short time of simulation .",

    "the influence of the lattice size and frequency of social encounters on macroscopic output have been examined in detail .    in the model , the age distributions of fbss express power laws ( fig .",
    "[ age ] ) .",
    "larger social networks , as reflected in larger lattices , have larger numbers of coexisting fbss ; on average , fbss in such systems are younger and have more adherents . at low levels of social encounters , fbss are , in general , older and have more adherents , than at higher levels of social encounters .",
    "a possible explanation of this pattern is that the single - encounter condition prevented agents from receiving support for their current fbs from adjacent interacting agents of the same fbs ; this could cause a higher incidence of conversion leading to more rapid extinction of unsuccessful fbss .    on the distributions of the fbss size ( cf .",
    "[ size ] ) local maxima of pdfs are visible .",
    "these maxima manifest the state in which almost all agents share the same fbs . these phenomena are clearly visible for non - binary interactions which in social systems correspond to long range interactions",
    ".    the toy model which was presented above allows for further possible extensions .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to examine fitness effects of fbss on agents , different distributions of agent and fbs traits , and more realistic social network and agent traits .",
    "such extensions may enable a better critique of the utility and robustness of models that perceive fbss as objects of natural selection .",
