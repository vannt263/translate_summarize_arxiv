    "recent experimental studies evidenced that living beings , such as bacteria @xcite , different water fleas @xcite , fish @xcite , birds @xcite and insects @xcite , are able to sustain a constant mean speed over large time scales .",
    "thus , these animals do not only perform passive brownian motion , but instead exhibit a so - called active stochastic motion @xcite , occurring far from equilibrium .",
    "such systems form a large field of recent theoretical interest @xcite , including the influence of fluctuations .",
    "one might relate the sources of fluctuations on animal motion either in the food supply @xcite or in the propulsive engine @xcite that drives the unit or by assuming a molecular agitation imposed externally outside @xcite . in this approach",
    "one widely uses similarities of the animal motion and brownian motion which einstein and smoluchowski independently described in a probabilistic theory @xcite .",
    "later on , langevin encoded this theory of stochastic systems into the newtonian notation of equations of motion @xcite , which present a first formulation of a stochastic differential equation .",
    "this concept , completed by an active element describing the self - propulsion , is nowadays widely used for the description of fluctuating animal motion @xcite . of foremost interest are the specific effects of the random impacts on the motion .",
    "our focus here is on agents subjected to a torque , resulting in circular motions .",
    "this feature can be caused , for example , by an external magnetic field with profound physiological implications @xcite , or due to boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the agents themselves may exhibit a preferred turning direction , either caused by asymmetries in the propulsion as occurring in the chemotaxis of sperm cells @xcite , as a search strategy @xcite , or also by interaction with other agents , which leads to the emergence of swarming characteristics @xcite .",
    "we start out by studying the planar motion of active particles with a constant velocity @xmath1 subjected to a constant torque @xmath2 . to take into account thermal or , more generally , the stochastic influence of the surrounding , we first consider an additional white gaussian noise @xmath3 driving the angle dynamics and discuss the resulting effective diffusion coefficient @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "next , we propose a more realistic model considering some persistence in the motion .",
    "therefore , we replace the white gaussian noise by a time - correlated gaussian noise ( colored noise ) , namely an ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( oup ) @xmath5 @xcite , which implies a memory for the curvature feature .",
    "this generalization then allows applications reaching from stochastic polymer dynamics @xcite over spiral wave motion @xcite up to animal trajectories @xcite . this present study using a constant torque @xmath2",
    "can principally also be applied to a different problem , namely the control of diffusion of electron beams in drift chambers in presence of additional magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we want to mention that other noise statistics , especially white poissonian noise @xcite , are conceivable .",
    "their study would form an interesting future extension of the present work .    in a driven motion with a constant speed @xmath1 the correlations with correlation time @xmath0 generate a persistence length @xmath6 of the trajectory : @xmath7 . as will be shown below",
    ", the inclusion of correlations will hence characteristically modify the dynamics .",
    "the resulting dynamics will be quantified by the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "our starting point is the equation of motion in two dimensions with a constant velocity @xmath1 and a random torque with the mean value @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics for the position vector @xmath9 derives from its velocity vector , reading @xmath10 with @xmath11 denoting the orientation of the velocity vector .",
    "this orientation @xmath11 , if governed by a constant torque and supplemented by random fluctuations , yields a stochastic dynamics for @xmath11 @xmath12 we consider the noise @xmath3 to be a white gaussian noise with the corresponding noise intensity denoted by @xmath13 and with vanishing mean .",
    "the @xmath14 in front of the random force is caused by the fact that the tangential acceleration scales as @xmath15 .",
    "it expresses the circumstance that fast agents can not change their direction as quickly as slower ones .    for a vanishing noise intensity",
    "the constant torque leads to circular shaped motion , whose size is dictated by their cyclotron radius @xmath16 .",
    "a non - vanishing noise intensity on the other hand induces a more erratic behavior .",
    "the mean square displacement ( msd ) corresponding to this dynamics can be directly calculated by using the shifted gaussian transition probability distribution @xmath17 .",
    "then the general expression for the msd of a particle with a constant velocity @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath18 yields in the case of white gaussian noise @xmath19 for small times @xmath20 a ballistic behavior @xmath21 results while for large times a crossover to diffusive motion @xmath22 takes place .",

    "( [ whitemsd ] ) in the limit of large times .",

    "@xcite , see for more detailed discussions @xcite .",
    "obviously , the diffusion as a function of the angular noise exhibits a maximum , with @xmath28 at @xmath29 , and vanishes for both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this is contrasted to the behavior of the diffusion without a torque , @xmath32 @xcite , which diverges for @xmath33 .",
    "the explanation is as follows : for small noise intensities , agents subjected to a constant torque move in circles around a fairly quasi - stationary center , whereas in absence of a torque the propagation proceeds along almost straight lines . with noise",
    "included , both motion types perform diffusion .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the mean square displacement in case of zero torque .",

    "accordingly , we use an oup as the most natural continuous - valued colored noise @xcite .",
    "hence , our new system with the constant velocity @xmath1 and the torque @xmath2 is described by the modified angle dynamics , reading @xmath38 this colored noise dynamics assumes one additional auxiliary process , namely the oup @xmath5 with the correlation time @xmath0 , the gaussian white noise @xmath3 and the corresponding noise intensity @xmath39 .",
    "note that we included here a dependence of the correlation time to the power @xmath40 in the noise intensity implying a corresponding change in dimension for @xmath34 as @xmath40 changes .",
    "in doing so , several different physical features can be addressed with no need to perform additional calculations .",
    "for example , for @xmath41 the random variable @xmath5 merges with the wiener process @xmath42 in the limit of infinite correlation times @xmath43 . in specific detail : @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , the case with @xmath45 delivers a variance of @xmath46 , which is independent of the correlation time @xcite .",

    "this reproduces the result of @xcite , where the motion of fish was analyzed within a similar model .",

    "<S> the stochastic dynamics of an active particle undergoing a constant speed and additionally driven by an overall fluctuating torque is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the random torque forces are expressed by a stochastic differential equation for the angular dynamics of the particle determining the orientation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a constant torque , the particle is supplemented by random torques which are modeled as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process with given correlation time @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these nonvanishing correlations cause a persistence of the particles trajectories and a change of the effective spatial diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the mean square displacement as a function of the correlation time and the noise intensity and detect a nonmonotonic dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient with respect to both correlation time and noise strength . </S>",
    "<S> a maximal diffusion behavior is obtained if the correlated angular noise straightens the curved trajectories , interrupted by small pirouettes , whereby the correlated noise amplifies a straightening of the curved trajectories caused by the constant torque . </S>"
