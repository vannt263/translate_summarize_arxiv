    "thanks to the development of the telescopes , more and more important and accurate data are obtained in almost all fields of astronomy . the multi - wavelength observations with hubble , spitzer space telescopes and other large ground - base telescopes give us much information of high redshift galaxies .",

    "* hereafter g15 ) and instantaneous star formation rate density ( sfrd ) @xcite up to about @xmath8 .",
    "because of the physical connection between the star formation history ( sfh ) and smd , we expect that these two measured quantities should be consistent with each other .    integrating the instantaneous sfh over redshift and making some correction for the mass - loss during the stellar evolution through stellar winds and explosion processes @xcite",
    ", we can get the predicted stellar mass density history ( smh ) .",
    "meanwhile , after the same stellar evolution correction , the sfh can be obtained from derivative of smh by redshift . just as mentioned above ,",
    "both of the sfh and smh can be measured independently .",
    "so one can compare them to check whether the instantaneous sfh and smh are consistent with each other .",
    "however , in order to make a reasonable comparison , the sfh and smh should be derived under same assumptions , such as initial mass function ( imf ) , metallicity and dust correction .",
    "furthermore , to get the unbiased sfh and smh , we also need to obtain the correct sfrd and smd calibration respectively . because all of these factors can affect the final comparison result ( g15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerous studies have been done to compare those two quantities , but their results are not consistent with each other .",
    "for example , some authors have found that there is a good agreement between the measured sfh and smh @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the sfh and smh had a general agreement with each other if considering some systematic effects , such as the evolution of the uv luminosity function of galaxy , stellar mass in uv faint galaxies and the dust attenuation varying with luminosity .",
    "@xcite constrained the sfh and smh based on the stellar mass - halo mass relation and found that both smh and sfh are consistent with observations . on the contrary",

    "@xcite ( hereafter , hb06 ) found that the smh inferred from the best - fitting sfh is larger than the observed one over redshift @xmath9 , and the larger factor peaked at redshift @xmath4 is about four .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , w08 ) compared the smd and sfrd in redshift @xmath10 .",
    "they found the derived sfh from observed smh is lower than the observed sfh and the discrepancy peaks at @xmath11 by 0.6 dex .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , md14 ) have also found this discrepancy , although it is not so significant",
    ". they have found that the inferred smd history was larger than the observed one by a factor about only 60% . however , these work used different stellar imf assumptions .",
    "hb06 used the imfs , noted as bg imf and sala imf in hb06 , given in @xcite .",
    "w08 defined a new imf with low - mass slope of -1.0 ( @xmath12 ) , and used this imf in their work . while md14 used a traditional salpeter imf with slope of -2.35 .",
    "the choices of imf can lead to some deviations in the comparison , which we will show in the discussion section .",
    "several explanations are proposed for this discrepancy , including underestimation of the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "instead , some authors claimed that the observed sfrd is overestimated in uv and ir band @xcite or fuv and u band @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a possible evolution of stellar imf will also affect the estimations of observed sfh and smh ( hb06 ; w08 ) . because this discrepancy is still under debate",
    ", we use a large observed sfrd and smd data , including the latest observations , to reinvestigate this problem by using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method and considering the stellar evolution effect in a more detailed way .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will give an introduction of the smd and sfh in section 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "in section 4 , we will introduce our method and give our result .",
    "some potential causes for the discrepancy between observed sfh and smh are discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , summary will be given in section 6 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the salpeter imf with index of -2.35 @xcite and solar metallicity as a universal metallicity in our work .",
    "the flat @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 and @xmath15 is adopted .",
    "the smd @xmath16 is the stellar mass in a unit co - moving cosmic volume at redshift @xmath17 .",
    "it can be obtained by integrating the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) @xmath18 at a certain redshift , @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the number of galaxies with mass between @xmath21 and @xmath22 in a unit co - moving cosmic volume . in practice",
    ", we integrate the gsmf from @xmath23 to @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 to @xmath26 , where the @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the low and high limits of stellar mass of galaxies .",
    "generally , the @xmath23 and @xmath24 are taken as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . in this work",
    ", all the smd data from g15 are obtained from integrating their gsmf over range of @xmath29 .",
    "however md14 adopted range about @xmath30 ( see md14 for more detail ) .",
    "fortunately , this little difference of low - mass limit does nt make much difference to the observed smd ( md14 ) .",
    "carefully , we also compare those observed smd data in g15 and md14 and find that the difference is less than 1% which can be neglected .    fundamentally , the method of estimating the smds is to fit the observed galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with a library of template seds .",
    "then we can obtain the optimal mass - to - light ratio @xmath31 parameter of the galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the imf plays a very important role in estimating the galaxy stellar mass .",
    "it represents the number ratio of stars with a certain mass among a stellar population which includes all of stars formed at the same time .",
    "usually , the bright massive stars emit almost all the light of a galaxy while the faint low - mass stars dominate the stellar mass of a galaxy so the low - mass slope of the imf affects the estimating of smd .",
    "meanwhile , there is a remarkable difference in the evolution of stars with different masses .",
    "the massive stars evolve faster and loss more mass than low - mass stars .",
    "therefore , assumptions on imf will affect the mass - to - light ratio @xmath31 of a galaxy as well as the recycling fraction of stellar mass , which means the mass fraction of each generation of stars return into the interstellar medium through stellar wind , explosion or some other processes .",
    "all of these will bias the estimation of the galaxy stellar mass . for simplicity ,",
    "a simple power - law imf of @xcite in the mass range @xmath32 is adopted in our work , although it is challenged by some observations .",
    "there are also some other imfs used in previous works @xcite , such as chabrier imf @xcite and modified salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "the converting factor of smd from one imf to another can be obtained using the population synthesis code like pegase @xcite * or fsps @xcite .",
    "*    metallicity is another important factor to affect the estimating of smds .",
    "low - matallicity star evolves faster while the high - metallicity star will loss more mass since the strong stellar wind .",
    "therefore , different metallicities will give different recycling fraction of stellar mass .",
    "moreover since the average cosmic matallicity evolves with redshift or the age of the univese , we should , in principle , use different matallicities at different redshifts .",
    "but it is so complex that we just adopt the solar metallicity @xmath33 as the universal metallicity in our work , which is consistent with that of md14 .",
    "we will leave the systematic bias analysis of metallicity assumption in discussion section .",
    "thanks to the large galaxy surveys such as sdss and 6dfgrs , and also some large telescopes such as hst , spitzer and vlt , smd data can be accurately measured to @xmath34 .",
    "we choose 124 observed smd data from previous literature over radshift range @xmath35 .",
    "since the smd data from different groups might be estimated in different imfs , we should rescale them to salpeter imf . luckily",
    ", these smd data scaled by salpeter imf can be found in md14 and g15 .",
    "all of these data and their references are listed in table 2 .",
    "determining the cosmic sfh is a key problem in many fields of astronomy , such as the formation of galaxy and the cosmic metallicity evolution .",
    "many works have been done to measure the cosmic sfh using different methods .",
    "hb06 used uv and ir luminosities as the tracers to measure the sfrd up to @xmath36 .",
    "there are also other tracers of the sfrd such as the h@xmath37 line , radio and x - ray emissions ( for a review , see md14 ) .",
    "sfrs are usually measured from the typical information of very massive stars , since they have very short life compared with the typical star forming timescale .",
    "the uv emission of a newly formed stellar population is dominated by those massive stars , so it can be an instantaneous indicator of the sfrs @xcite . besides , since the interstellar dust can absorb the uv emission from those massive stars and re - radiate at mir and fir wavelengths , the ir observations can be another important indicator of the sfrs @xcite .",
    "generally , the dust extinction at fir band is negligible while at uv band is much more significant , especially for those star forming regions surrounded by dense clouds .",
    "therefore , the correction of dust extinction for using the uv luminosity as sfrd indicator is very important . for the ir band radiation ,",
    "since the dust can be also heated by old low - mass stars or agns , it is not good enough to use ir luminosity to estimate the sfrd when the cosmic sfr is very small or for those galaxies with low sfr such as our milky way @xcite .",
    "the ir luminosity becomes a robust tracer to sfr at @xmath38 , where the larger sfr makes the new born massive stars dominating the dust heating .",
    "however , the ir detector is not sensitive enough to measure the ir luminosity of high - redshift galaxies , while the uv emission can be measured easier at @xmath39 as it is redshifted to optical band .",
    "therefore , combining uv and ir observations can give us a better estimation of the cosmic sfrd over all redshift range .",
    "what s more , since the short life of the massive star , the death events of massive stars can also be tools to measure the sfrs , such as core - collapse supernovae @xcite and long duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "being same as smd , the estimation of sfrd also depends on the choice of imf since those indicators can only trace the formation rates of massive stars .",
    "we need to factor the total sfr over the entire mass range based on an imf assumption .",
    "md14 chose the sfr data estimated from fuv and ir data based on the salpeter imf and gave the sfh up to @xmath34 by fitting the observed data .",
    "it has form as @xmath40^d}\\rm~m_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}~mpc^{-3}\\ ] ] with the optimal parameters @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite also gave another form of sfh as @xmath42 where the @xmath14 is reduced hubble constant .",
    "the optimal parameters are @xmath43 after considering the dust extinction . the data without correction for absorption yields @xmath44 .",
    "hb06 used a modified salpeter imf , which noted as sala imf , and gave the optimal parameters as @xmath45 . in following analysis",
    ", we will use both of these two forms of sfh to remove the possible effect of sfh forms . for the form in md14",
    ", we simply adopt their optimal parameters . while for the cole form , we adopt the optimal parameters gave in hb06 .",
    "because of the different choices of imf , we use the factor 0.77 suggested in hb06 to convert the sfh to salpeter one .",
    "the cosmic smd at a certain redshift is the cumulative mass of all the stars formed at higher redshifts . therefore the smd @xmath16 can be expressed by the integration of the sfh @xmath46 as ( md14 ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hubble parameter in a flat @xmath13cdm cosmology , and the recycling fraction factor @xmath49 represents the mass fraction of each stellar population returned to the interstellar medium .",
    "this fraction factor can be obtained by using stellar population synthesis code . in previous work , md14 used a constant fraction factor @xmath50 while g15 used a value of 0.28 .",
    "the above equation is just an approximation of the actual mass recycling process because it is based on an assumption that the recycling process happens instantaneously .",
    "however , a newly stellar generation would have returned only little mass while a generation formed at early time would have returned more mass into interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , a more accurate equation should be expressed as ( w08 ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass fraction of the stellar generation , which formed at @xmath53 , have been returned into interstellar medium at time @xmath54 . if @xmath52 is a constant , equation ( [ relation_sfr_smd_2 ] ) reduces to equation ( [ relation_sfr_smd_1 ] ) .    to calculate @xmath52 , we consider the mass evolution of an instantaneously formed stellar population using the fsps code @xcite .",
    "this code can give the evolution of the current remained stellar mass fraction , which means @xmath55 , of a simple stellar population after setting some necessary parameters .",
    "we choose the salpeter imf and solar metallicity while leaving other parameters as their default values in the code , which means the padova isochrones model is used .",
    "the parameter of the dust absorption model is @xmath56 , which is corresponding to the power - law attenuation model . for the dust emission model ,",
    "@xmath57 means the draine & li ( 2007 ) model .",
    "we consider the nebular continuum component , i.e. , @xmath58 . more detailed information can be found in the manual for fsps 2.5 code , which can be downloaded on github.com/cconroy20/fsps . ] .",
    "[ ftfig ] shows the evolution of the current mass fraction @xmath59 of a simple stellar population .",
    "we can see that it has almost no mass loss within 1 myr , then the fraction is up to about 0.27 at @xmath60 gyr .",
    "if we just adopt a constant recycling fraction factor @xmath50 , we will over - estimate the mass - loss effect in stellar evolution . the choice of imf and metallicity will affect the evolution of @xmath61 , which will be discussed in detail in discussion section .    given the form of sfh @xmath46 , we can predict the smh with equation ( [ relation_sfr_smd_1 ] ) or equation ( [ relation_sfr_smd_2 ] ) . both md14 and g15 used equation ( [ relation_sfr_smd_1 ] ) , but their recycling fraction factors are slightly different , which are 0.27 and 0.28 respectively . in our work ,",
    "we use the evolving @xmath61 instead of the constant one ( hereafter , @xmath61 represents the evolving recycling factor while the @xmath49 represents the constant one ) . since",
    "many previous works have been done to determine the evolution of cosmic sfh , we can use their results to predict the smh with our @xmath61 .    in the top panel of fig .",

    "we choose the sfh form as equation ( [ eq_madausfh ] ) used in md14 .",
    "and then we use equation ( [ relation_sfr_smd_2 ] ) and mcmc method to fit the observed smd data and obtain the optimal parameters .",

    "therefore we discuss the possible effect of the choice of imf and metallicity on our result and some other potential causes for this discrepancy in this section .",
    "generally , the high - mass slope of imf affects the estimation of sfrs since the young massive stars in a new born stellar population dominant the emission especially for the uv emission . while the low - mass slope of imf affects the estimation of smds since the old low - mass stars dominant the stellar mass of a galaxy .",
    "therefore , a more top - heavy imf will generate more massive stars , which emit more radiation leading to a high luminosity - to - sfr ratio .",
