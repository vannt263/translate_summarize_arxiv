    "the majority of rapidly rotating old recycled pulsars have frequencies , @xmath18 , in the interval between 200 and 600  hz .",
    "thus , the kepler frequency , @xmath14 , occurs much higher than rotation frequencies of young pulsars and even higher than those for the majority of the recycled pulsars .    a possible mechanism , which may be responsible for rapid diminishing of rotation frequency of young fast pulsars up to experimentally measured values , is related to the @xmath0-mode instability .",
    "the @xmath0-modes , whose restoring force is the coriolis force , are closely related to rossby waves in earth s atmosphere and oceans .",
    "their instability was discovered by andersson , friedman , and morsink  @xcite ; see also review  @xcite .",
    "if the instability occurs , the star rapidly radiates its angular momentum via gravitational waves until the rotation frequency @xmath19 reaches the critical value @xmath20 , at which the @xmath0-modes become stable .",
    "this rapid process is accompanied by the neutron star reheating  @xcite . for frequencies",
    "@xmath21 @xmath0-modes become damped and the star cools down during @xmath22yr by the neutrino radiation and at later times , by the surface photon radiation , slowly loosing its angular momentum during the time evolution  @xcite .",

    "the instability is most pronounced at temperatures @xmath26  k.    different mechanisms , which may eliminate the @xmath0-mode instability , have been studied , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "most attempts were made to find appropriate arguments for an increase of the shear and bulk viscosities of the neutron star matter .",
    "a common opinion has been formed that traditionally considered dissipation mechanisms are insufficient to provide stability for a large number of old pulsars in lmxbs .",
    "this would be at odds with expectations , because then these pulsars would still rapidly decrease their frequencies below the observed values  @xcite .",
    "the minimum value of the frequency at the @xmath0-mode stability boundary @xmath27 is even smaller than the value @xmath28 if one uses standard dissipation mechanisms only ; e.g. , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "one distinguishes three different contributions to the bulk viscosity of the dense and warm nucleon matter : the kinetic term proportional to the typical nucleon collision time , the soft - mode relaxation term , and the radiative contribution . at the neutron star conditions the kinetic term in the bulk viscosity is much smaller than the shear viscosity term and some other contributions to the bulk viscosity .",
    "the processes induced by charged weak currents in matter driven slightly out of the @xmath29-equilibrium occur at very slow rate .",
    "as was shown long ago by mandelstam and leontovich  @xcite , in a system out of equilibrium the slow processes may essentially contribute to the bulk viscosity .",
    "we call this part of the bulk viscosity thesoft - mode \" contribution , because it is related to the response function of the nuclear matter at very small frequencies .    references  @xcite argued that high values of the soft - mode bulk viscosity might be induced by the reactions @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the presence of hyperons in neutron star interiors .",
    "however , the realistic equation of state ( eos ) should not allow for a large fraction of hyperons in the star ; otherwise it would be not able to describe the observable star masses .",

    "@xmath37 , the du processes are forbidden , because it is impossible to fulfill the energy - momentum conservation law .",
    "the appearance of the du processes in the neutron star interiors for @xmath38 causes significant increase of the soft - mode bulk viscosity that would lead to a strong damping of the @xmath0-modes  @xcite .",
    "the value of the critical density @xmath39 essentially depends on the symmetry energy in the eos .",
    "ordinary relativistic mean - field models and the microscopic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations produce low values of @xmath39 .",
    "the work  @xcite observed that the @xmath0-mode instability region shrinks for those eos that have a large symmetry energy slop @xmath40 , because the value of the critical density for the du processes decreases with the increase of @xmath40 ; here @xmath41 , the nuclear saturation density @xmath42  @xmath43 , and @xmath44 stands for the symmetry energy .",

    "the phonon - phonon interaction might give a contribution to the bulk viscosity in the region of the 1s@xmath3 neutron pairing , but the results are strongly model dependent .",
    "therefore , we ignore this contribution to the soft - mode bulk viscosity .",
    "however , the neutrino emissivity of the two - nucleon processes might be essentially enhanced with the density increase because of a modification of the one - pion exchange in nucleon medium .",

    "being evaluated with relevant values of the landau - migdal parameters , the short - range part of the @xmath55 interaction amplitude corrected by the loops decreases with a density increase , whereas the more long - range dressed pion exchange term becomes strongly enhanced . as a consequence of the softening of the pion mode at growing density , for @xmath59 there may appear charged and neutral pion condensates  @xcite .",
    "with increase of the squared matrix element of the @xmath55 interaction , the nucleon shear viscosity should diminish , whereas the bulk viscosity should increase .",
    "the possibility of the pion mode softening , leading to an increase of the @xmath55 interaction amplitude with the growth of the nucleon density , which is found important for the analysis of the neutron star cooling , has not been yet incorporated in the analyses of the viscosity . in this work",
    "we reanalyze the stability of @xmath0-modes in pulsars within the scenario , where the one - nucleon reactions ( du ) are suppressed in the majority of neutron stars ( with masses @xmath60 ) , but the two - nucleon reactions on charged current , called medium modified urca ( mmu ) reactions , are enhanced by the pion - mode softening .",
    "additionally , we include contributions to the bulk viscosity induced by the reactions of the negatively charged pion condensate  pion urca ( pu ) reaction , @xmath61 , @xmath36 ,  provided the pion condensate exists for @xmath62 .",
    "we consider two possibilities  pion condensate occurs for @xmath63 and it does not occur  but there is a softening of the pion mode , which degree we vary .",
    "as we have mentioned , the energy of the @xmath0-mode can be dissipated not only via the non - equilibrium ( soft mode ) effects but also via a neutrino radiation .",
    "the latter mechanism constitutes another source of the bulk viscosity , the so - called radiative viscosity .",
    "it was studied only recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . only the du and",
    "mu reactions were incorporated .",

    "we analyze the mentioned effects in this paper .",
    "the shear viscosity contains two important contributions : one from the lepton scattering and another one from the nucleon scattering .",

    "the importance of the screening effects in the calculation of the shear viscosity at low temperatures was first emphasized in ref .",
    "note that these loop - screening effects in the photon exchange ( dressing of the photon ) are similar to the effects we incorporate in the pion exchange in the @xmath55 interaction ( dressing of the pion ) . the lepton shear viscosity computed following ref .",
    "@xcite proves to be an order of magnitude smaller than that computed in refs .",
    "note that the flowers - itoh result has been exploited in many papers studying the @xmath0-mode stability .",
    "these studies should be now redone with new values of the shear viscosities calculated with inclusion of the polarization effects . in the presence of the proton superfluidity",
    "the lepton term increases  @xcite , which also should be taken into account .",
    "although the screening effects reduce the value of the lepton shear viscosity , it still remains larger than the nucleon shear viscosity term , provided the later term is computed with the vacuum @xmath55 cross sections ; cf .",
    "below we show that this conclusion does not change after we take into account the pion - softening effect in the @xmath55 contribution to the shear viscosity .",
    "thus , the lepton shear viscosity proves to be the dominant damping mechanism for low temperatures @xmath70 k , at which the bulk viscosity term is strongly suppressed .",
    "the goldstone mode contribution to the shear viscosity in superfluid neutron star matter induced by phonon - phonon interactions was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . even in the ballistic regime ,",
    "when the phonons move freely within the whole superfluid region , being captured only at its borders , the phonon contribution to the shear viscosity proves to be small for @xmath71  k. for higher temperatures ( but still in the superfluid phase ) this effect should be included .",
    "phonons in a nucleon superfluid may interact with neutrons .",
    "below we calculate the corresponding novel contribution to the shear viscosity .",

    "the mixture of @xmath0-modes with other more stable resonance superfluid inertial modes in the star has been suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite as a reason for the stability of old recycled pulsars in x - ray binaries .",
    "the authors argue that the mixture can only occur at some fixed  resonance \" stellar temperatures .",
    "the fast - spinning stars would cluster , therefore , in the vicinity of this temperature .",
    "the spin frequencies of stars are then limited by the instability of octupole ( @xmath75 ) @xmath0-mode rather than by quadruple ( @xmath76 ) @xmath0-mode .",

    "the main uncertainty in the description of the crust - core transition arises from uncertainties in the parameter @xmath40 mainly owing to its dependence of the shear modulus . using the estimated core temperatures of several lmxb pulsars and the eos that describes the crust - core transition , and assuming that the main dissipation mechanism of the @xmath0-modes in old recycled pulsars is attributable to the electron - electron scattering at the crust - core boundary , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that these neutron stars can be stabilized against @xmath0-mode oscillations , only if @xmath78  mev .",
    "however , we should note that stability of @xmath0-modes at the crust - core boundary does not yet guarantee stability of the star as the whole .",
    "a similar constraint on @xmath40 ( @xmath79  mev ) was extracted in ref .",

    "the spin - down evolution is generically slower than the thermal evolution , so that a star eventually reaches a steady state where heating equals cooling .",
    "reference  @xcite included a possibility of a differential rotation of the star . in their analysis",
    "the saturation is reached within 100s , for @xmath84 , in dependence on the value of the parameter @xmath85 characterizing an initial amount of the differential rotation , and the thermal evolution is slower than the spindown evolution .",
    "these approaches do not include thermal conductivity , nucleon superfluidity , or some other effects .",
    "for instance , the heat transport essentially delays the neutrino cooling .",
    "references  @xcite demonstrate that effects of non - zero thermal conductivity are important even for the duration of @xmath86  yr ; their inclusion helps to explain rapid cooling of the pulsar in cassiopea a. thus , these interesting investigations still can not be considered as unequivocal and further analysis is required .",
    "another aspect of the problem is that in the rotating neutron star there may appear an inhomogeneous condensate of bosonic excitations occupying a state with a finite momentum @xmath87 .",
    "it may occur if there are low - lying soundlike or rotonlike branches in the spectrum of excitations with boson quantum numbers , and the star rotation velocity exceeds the landau critical value @xmath88 given by the minimum of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the energy of the excitations  @xcite .",
    "a possibility of the condensation of rotons in the @xmath91he - filled capillaries was first suggested by pitaevskii in ref .",
    "the general consideration applicable for different non - relativistic and relativistic systems including neutron stars was performed in ref .",
    "a possibility of the condensation of zero - sound - like modes in fermi liquids was considered in ref .",

    "@xcite was recently applied to cold atoms  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that for sufficiently high angular velocities , @xmath92 , the condensates of bosonic excitations carrying a nonzero momentum can appear in some regions of the neutron star provided that the momentum is sufficiently large but the corresponding excitation energy is rather low .",
    "then a part of the angular momentum of the star can be transferred to the condensate . as a result",
    "a part of the star rotates slower , whereas the remaining angular momentum is contained in the internal motion of the condensate .",
    "a similar effect may occur , if in the interior regions there exist nonhomogeneous pion and kaon condensates .",

    "this is the key figure demonstrating results of our present study .",
    "we showed that with the bulk viscosity calculated within the minimal cooling paradigm  @xcite , when the most efficient neutrino processes are the mu and the pbf ones , the value of the spin frequency of the most rapidly rotating young pulsar psr  j0537 - 6910 ( @xmath922  hz ) is above the minimum on curve @xmath27 .",
    "the observed frequency of pulsar psr  j0537 - 6910 would be hardly explained , if the pulsar were in unstable region .",

    "however , because the star has passed the @xmath0-mode unstable region during its early evolution , it may hardly keep its mass very close to the maximal possible value .",
    "another possibility  @xcite to explain the data on psr  j0537 - 6910 within the minimal cooling paradigm exists if the trajectory @xmath924 is appropriately shifted to the left from the minimum of the @xmath27 . to find actual @xmath924 dependence",
    "one should solve the system of dynamical equations for the rotation frequency @xmath925 , temperature @xmath926 , and @xmath0-mode amplitude @xmath927 .",
    "the low values of the observed frequencies of the young pulsars are naturally explained within the nuclear medium cooling scenario of refs .",
    "@xcite , which we exploit in the present work . with the pion softening effects included , the frequency 62  hz proves to be below the minimum of @xmath27 provided the star mass is @xmath928 , whereas the du process appears for @xmath929 . at the same time , we observe that the frequencies of most rapidly rotating recycled pulsars in lmxb are substantially above curve @xmath27 at relevant temperatures @xmath930  k. this statement is insensitive to any possible enhancement of the bulk viscosity ( in the mmu , pu and du processes ) . also , any artificial increase of the lepton shear viscosity in reasonable limits does not help to rise the line @xmath27 above the data points .",
    "as a possibility to explain the stability of the rotation of the pulsars in lmxb , we suggested a new mechanism allowing to _ transfer a part of the angular momentum to inhomogeneous condensates of bosonic excitations _ and/or to the inhomogeneous charged pion / kaon condensates .",
    "for this transfer to occur  @xcite , one needs bosonic modes with low energies at sufficiently large momenta to exist in the neutron star matter .",
    "when a part of the angular momentum is transferred to the inhomogeneous condensate , as the consequence of the angular momentum conservation , the remaining non - condensate part of the matter participating in the @xmath0-mode generation will rotate with a lower angular velocity . more specifically , we took into account condensation of excitations occupying the mode at a finite momentum in the proton superfluid .",
    "then the part of the star , where there is the proton pairing , may rotate with a much lower speed than the other part of the star .",
    "we modeled the effect in simplifying assumptions that the critical velocity for the appearance of the condensate of excitations is very low and a part of the star , where the condensate occurred , is fully stopped .",
    "our results presented in fig .  [ fig : nubcondin ] show that , with such effects taken into account , the critical frequency @xmath656 may increase substantially and the data on the rapidly rotating old pulsars may fall into the @xmath0-mode stable region .",
    "one usually assumes that old pulsars are slowed down owing to the magnetic dipole radiation , simultaneously losing the magnetic field . at a longer time period old recycled pulsars in lmxb are spin up owing to the accretion of matter from a companion star  @xcite .",
    "we proposed a supplementary mechanism of the pulsar acceleration owing to the charged pion / kaon condensation with non - zero momentum accumulated in the course of the accretion .",
    "because it is energetically favorable for the condensate to move as a whole in a one particular direction , the non - condensate matter would be driven in the opposite direction , which results in an acceleration of the non - condensate part of the star , as seen by a distant observer .",
    "concluding , the data on young rapidly rotating pulsars can be naturally explained provided one incorporates pion - softening effects with increase of the density . as for the old rapidly rotating recycled pulsars in lmxb , in spite of a lot of works performed by many researchers including the present research , further more detailed calculations , as well as the search for new stability mechanisms ,",
    "are needed to arrive at a convincing explanation of their @xmath0-mode stability .",
