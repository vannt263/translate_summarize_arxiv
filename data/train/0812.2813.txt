    "the afterglow emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is generally well described by the blast wave model @xcite . this model details the temporal and spectral behaviour of the emission that is created by external shocks when a collimated ultra - relativistic jet ploughs into the circumburst medium , driving a blast wave ahead of it .",
    "the level of collimation , or jet opening angle , has important implications for the energetics of the underlying physical process , progenitor models , and the possible use of grbs as standard candles .",
    "the signature of the collimation , according to simple analytical models , is an achromatic temporal steepening or ` jet break ' at approximately one day in an otherwise decaying , power - law light curve ; from the time of this break , the jet opening angle can be estimated @xcite .    since the launch of the _ swift _ satellite @xcite it has become clear that this model for grbs can not , in its current form , explain the full complexity of observed light curve features and the lack of observed achromatic temporal breaks .",
    "the unexpected features detected , such as steep decays , plateau phases ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a large number of x - ray flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) have revealed the complexity of these sources up to about one day since the initial event , which is yet to be fully understood .",
    "these superimposed features also make it difficult to measure the underlying power - law features on which the blast wave model is based , and may lead to misinterpretations of the afterglows .",
    "achromatic temporal breaks are not observed in the majority of bursts , up to weeks in a few bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in some afterglows ,",
    "a break is unobserved in both the x - ray and optical light curves , while in other bursts a break is observed in one regime but not the other ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous comprehensive studies of _ swift _ light curves in multiple wavelengths @xcite have attempted to identify achromatic temporal breaks due either to jet breaks , or the cessation of continued energy injection ( i.e. end of the plateau phase ) , mainly as they concern the energy requirement of bursts .",
    "identification of jet breaks is also important as a test of the blast wave physics as it represents the time at which sideways spreading of the jet becomes important and the edges of the jet become visible .",
    "the post jet break phase also gives a direct measurement of the electron energy distribution , @xmath0 , as the temporal decay , at all wavelengths , during this phase should have a value equal to that of @xmath0 .",
    "however , due to differences between broken power - law fits and the underlying parameters @xcite , this method may systematically underestimate the true value of @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 may also be measured from the spectral information of the optical or x - ray bands ; the accuracy of this method is then dependent on the quality of the spectra used .",
    "a study of _ bepposax _",
    "bursts used broadband optical to x - ray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to accurately constrain the value of @xmath0 via the spectral and temporal parameters of both bands , and a comparison to the blast wave model @xcite .",
    "the same authors also use this method to estimate the density profile of the circumburst medium , @xmath1 , as the temporal slope may depend on this value as defined by @xmath3 ; a constant density medium , @xmath4 causing a more shallow decay than a wind like medium , @xmath5 .",
    "similar interpretations of the temporal and spectral information may also be used to estimate the effect , if any , that continued energy injection has on the light curves . continued energy injection",
    "is used to explain the shallow decay phase observed in many _",
    "swift _ grbs and is usually assumed to take the form of @xmath6 @xcite . the additional energy can be due to slower shells of matter catching up with to blast wave , or a continued activity of the central engine . in either case , the addition of the extra energy to the blast wave causes the flux to drop off less rapidly than it would otherwise , and is observed as a shallower than expected decay .",
    "the cessation of the energy injection is marked by a temporal break to the normal decay phase as predicted by the blast wave model which implies , if it is due to continued activity of the central engine , that the engine must be active for up to about a day .",
    "such late activity of the central engine has been observed in the form of episodic flares but such late , smooth and continuous activity has yet to be confirmed .    in this paper",
    "we interpret a sample of afterglows of _ swift _ grbs , to constrain the blast wave parameters : electron energy distribution , @xmath0 , density profile of the circumburst medium , @xmath1 , and the continued energy injection index , @xmath2 . in  [ breaks : observations ] we introduce our sample and the method of reduction , while in  [ breaks : results ] we present the results of our temporal and spectral analysis . in  [ breaks : discussion ] we interpret the results in the context of the blast wave model and discuss their implications in the overall context of grb observations .",
    "we summarise our findings in  [ breaks : conclusion ] . throughout",
    ", we use the convention that a power - law flux is given as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the temporal decay index and @xmath9 is the spectral index .",
    "all uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath10 confidence level .",
    "the bursts in our sample were chosen from an inspection of previous literature on samples of temporal breaks @xcite .",
    "bursts were also chosen from a comparison of the pre - reduced _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt , @xcite ) light curves in the on - line repository up to the end of february 2008 , and from the literature of optical data .",
    "our sample ( table [ breaks : sample - table ] ) consists of bursts with x - ray and optical light curves with good enough time coverage to allow for the underlying single power - law , or broken power - law , to be determined .",
    "the bursts are also well sampled enough in the x - ray and optical to constrain the spectral indices , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "bursts with published optical data were preferred over bursts with only gcn ( gamma - ray bursts coordinates network circular ) data which , by their very nature , are preliminary and hence difficult to compare with other data sets .",
    "however , in the cases of bursts with significant amounts of data from a single source , which we assume to be self - consistent , these data were included even if published only in gcns .",
    "we did not confine our sample to bursts with clear breaks in either the x - ray or optical bands as we wanted to include the possibility of hidden or not very obvious breaks , particularly in the x - ray @xcite , or late , unobserved breaks .",
    ".galactic absorption , @xmath13 , galactic extinction , @xmath14 @xcite , and spectroscopic redshift , @xmath15 , for the grbs in our sample . [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , < \" , ]      we find that @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath1 unconstrained . despite the fact that the broadband sed seems to favour a broken power - law ( though this is not conclusive )",
    ", the parallel nature of the lightcurves suggests that there is no cooling break between regimes so both the x - ray and optical regimes are either above , or below , the cooling break . for @xmath19 , @xmath20 implies @xmath21 in agreement with both the x - ray and optical temporal slopes , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the break , to @xmath24 , observed in the x - ray at @xmath25s is interpreted as a jet break , albeit a slightly shallow one , though it may be rolling over to a steeper asymptotic value . here",
    ", the early shallow phase is likely due to continued energy injection of the form , @xmath18 , causing the observed x - ray break of @xmath26 , and consistent with the optical .",
    "such an energy injection would increase the energy of the afterglow over the observed period of injection by a factor of @xmath27 .    if @xmath28 , @xmath29 implies @xmath30 or @xmath31 for a constant density or wind driven medium , respectively , steeper than either observed slope before @xmath25s but consistent with the slope after that time .",
    "the break with @xmath32 , dependent on @xmath1 , can be explained by energy injection of between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this would then mean that the early shallow phase can not be explained by energy injection of the same form and would require an additional energy injection component , so we favour our initial explanation .",
    "we find that @xmath35 for @xmath17 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the broken power - law sed implies that the x - ray regime is above the cooling frequency , which in turn implies @xmath38 and @xmath39 , in agreement with the observed x - ray index of @xmath40 after 2000s . the optical temporal slope , @xmath41 ,",
    "is then explained as being below the cooling break and in a medium with @xmath42 .",
    "the break observed in the x - ray light curve and consistent with the optical data is interpreted as a jet break rolling over to the expected value of @xmath43 , in agreement with the observed value of @xmath44 .",
    "it is unclear what the x - ray emission before 2000s is , but given that no shallowing is observed in optical , we can assume that it is not caused by continued energy injection , at least not in isolation .",
    "if it were due to continued energy injection , it would have a value of @xmath45 .",
    "we do not find a blast wave interpretation consistent with the light curves of this burst .",
    "the inconsistency of the optical and x - ray slopes suggests that the cooling frequency is between the two regimes and @xmath46 , in agreement with the sed which is best described with a broken power - law .",
    "when @xmath47 , the predicted value of @xmath48 significantly ( @xmath49 ) underestimates the observed value of @xmath50 , though the optical can be explained in this scenario if the circumburst density profile has an index of @xmath36 .",
    "the post - break optical slope of @xmath51 and an assumed ` hidden ' x - ray break could be consistent with the predicted @xmath43 in this interpretation .",
    "however , given the disagreement of the pre - break x - ray temporal slope with the predicted value , it seems that the data of this burst are inconsistent with the blast wave model .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who suggest that the x - ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process rather than blast - wave shock emission .",
    "the universality of the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 , has been examined by several authors ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite applied different methods to samples of _ bepposax _ and _ swift _ bursts , all reaching the same conclusion that the observed range of @xmath0 values is not consistent with a single central value of @xmath0 . @xcite and @xcite showed that the width of the parent distribution is @xmath52 . in the studies",
    "so far there have been some limitations : the _ bepposax _ sample is limited , both in the number of grbs and the temporal and spectral sampling ; and the only study of _ swift _ bursts for this purpose so far by @xcite only used the x - ray afterglows , which introduces a large uncertainty because the position of the cooling break is unknown . here",
    "we examine the universatily of @xmath0 for our sample of _ swift _ bursts by using the same methods as described in @xcite .",
    "we test the null hypothesis that the observed distribution of @xmath0 ( table [ breaks : blast - table ] excluding bracketed values and figure [ breaks : p - plot ] ) can be obtained from a parent distribution with a single central value of @xmath0 .",
    "we minimise the log - likelihood as given in equation 3 of @xcite , and we find the most likely value of @xmath53 . to test our null hypothesis , we generate @xmath54 different synthetic data sets for @xmath0 for the 6 bursts in our sample by taking random numbers from probability distributions that are described by the most likely value of @xmath55 and the @xmath56 uncertainties in the 6 values of @xmath0 .",
    "we then take 6 values of @xmath0 coming from these synthetic data sets and calculate the most likely value of @xmath0 and the accompanying log - likelihood . comparing the log - likelihood of the synthetic data with that coming from the measured @xmath0 values",
    ", we conclude that the null hypothesis is rejected at the @xmath57 level .",
    "following @xcite , we can also derive the width of the parent distribution , which is @xmath58 at the @xmath56 level and @xmath59 at the @xmath60 level .",
    "we also tested the 10 values of @xmath0 from table [ breaks : p - table ] that offered the least deviation from the expected canonical value of @xmath61 , with no regard for the interpretation of the light curves or seds .",
    "in this case , the most likely value of @xmath0 is @xmath62 and the values are inconsistent with one population at the @xmath63 level .",
    "this result confirms the results from previous studies and has important implications for theoretical particle acceleration studies .",
    "some of these ( semi-)analytical calculations and simulations indicate that there is a nearly universal value of @xmath64 ( e.g. @xcite ) , while other studies suggest that there is a large range of possible values for @xmath0 of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "although we find that there is not a universal value of @xmath0 , our values for the width of the parent distribution indicate that it is not as wide as the latter study suggest .",
    "the width we find , @xmath66 is comparable to the numbers found by @xcite and @xcite , but our results are based on a sample with better temporal and spectral sampling per grb , on average .    given that the value of @xmath0 is not universal , it may be possible that it changes suddenly or evolves gradually with time or radius even in a single event as environmental blast wave parameters ( e.g. , magnetic field , ambient density ) change or evolve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case our derived values of @xmath0 should be considered time averaged values of the parameter .",
    "a change or evolution of @xmath0 should be observable as a change or evolution of the synchrotron spectral index , @xmath67 , but should also cause a deviation from the power or broken power - law decay indices ( @xmath68 , table[breaks : p - relations ] ) of the light curves , though neither of these effects is observable in our data .      the density structure , or profile , of the circumburst medium",
    "is generally given as @xmath69 , or @xmath70 ( number density ) , @xmath71 where @xmath4 is a constant density , or ism - like , medium and @xmath5 is a wind - like medium .",
    "the value of @xmath1 has important implications for the study of progenitor models as the currently favoured model for long grbs , involving the collapse of a massive , wolf - rayet star , is expected to have an associated strong stellar wind affecting the circumburst environment .",
    "support for a stellar wind has been observed via absorption lines with relative velocities in uv spectra in a number of cases , most notably grb021004 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite found , from broadband modeling of 10 bursts , that a constant density medium was favoured in half the cases and in only one case was a wind driven profile necessary .",
    "@xcite found , from a sample of 10 bursts , that 4 were likely wind driven while 2 were certainly not consistent with a wind .    in our sample of 10 bursts , only 6 have x - ray or optical light curves below the cooling break , @xmath72 , where they are dependent on the circumburst density profile and in the case of grb060206 this interpretation is only one of two that can not be distinguished . of our calculated values of @xmath1 ( table[breaks : blast - table ] and figure[breaks : k - plot ] ) ,",
    "2 are consistent ( @xmath73 ) with both @xmath5 and @xmath4 ( grb050801 and grb060206 ) ; 2 are best described with a wind - like medium and are inconsistent ( @xmath63 ) with @xmath4 ( grb050802 and grb061121 ) ; and 2 are consistent ( @xmath74 ) with a constant density medium but inconsistent with @xmath5 ( grb051109a and grb060124 ) .",
    "our results are hence consistent with those of @xcite and @xcite insofar as the sample requires both constant density and wind driven media to explain the observed broadband emission , as the sample is not consistent with only one of the two environments .",
    "it seems clear that the circumburst environments are unlikely to be drawn from only one of the ism or wind - like profiles and , in fact , the wind - like expectation is only valid assuming a constant mass - loss rate and wind velocity form the progenitor star ; precarious assumptions for a star in its final death throws and given that the circumburst density profile may be affected by a number of processes .",
    "firstly , a reverse shock is expected to propagate backwards through the wind as it meets the interstellar medium and would cause a constant density , shocked wind .",
    "also , the unshocked ism itself has an constant density profile but its distance from the burst makes it unlikely that we would observe the blast wave traversing the ism .",
    "however , recent observations of wolf - rayet binaries suggests that this shock front might be much closer to the progenitor if the wind is asymmetric @xcite .",
    "this would make it more likely that the blast wave would already be travelling through the ism at the time of observations , as would a high progenitor velocity towards the observer .",
    "in fact , the transition of the blast wave across the wind s shock front to the unshocked ism has been suggested in a small number of cases , for instance , grb030329 @xcite . not only",
    "can we expect density profiles of @xmath5 or @xmath4 ; @xcite discuss the fact that in type ib / c supernovae , with which grbs are closely associated ( e.g. , grb030329/sn2003dh , @xcite ) , density profiles are found to range from @xmath75 to @xmath76 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite proposed continued energy injection as a process to explain the shallower than expected decay indices observed in many _",
    "swift _ bursts .",
    "we assume this takes the form of @xmath6 where @xmath2 is dependent on the shallowing effect of the injection , @xmath77 , and on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the continued energy injection is either due to @xmath78 a distribution of the lorentz factors of the shells ejected from the central engine which causes those shells with lower lorentz factor to catch up with the blast wave at a later time , or @xmath79 continued activity of the central engine itself .",
    "the former has a limit of @xmath80 , where @xmath1 is the density profile of the circumburst medium , which @xcite suggested could be used as a diagnostic to differentiate between the two sources of continued energy injection .    for 7 of the 10 light curves in our sample we are able to estimate the level of energy injection , or to say that it is consistent with zero ( table[breaks : blast - table ] and figure[breaks : q - plot ] ) , though in the case of grb060206 there are two equally valid interpretations , one requiring energy injection while the other does not .",
    "excluding grb060206 , energy injection is only required in 3 out of 6 bursts and each of these has an injection index , @xmath2 , of between 0.65 and 1.0 , corresponding to increases in the energy of the afterglows over the observed periods of injection of a factor , @xmath81 of between 5 and 10 .",
    "these values of @xmath2 and @xmath81 are consistent with both scenarios of energy injection and with previously calculated values of @xcite .",
    "clearly a much larger sample of multi - wavelength afterglows is required to be able to constrain the sample properties of @xmath2 .",
    "these results compare to those of @xcite who find that the majority of xrt light curves with observed breaks require energy injection .",
    "however , those authors study a significantly different , much larger sample of bursts while we consider a sample of only the most well sampled .",
    "throughout this paper we have applied the blast wave model @xcite , assuming on - axis viewing , a standard jet structure and no evolution of the microphysical parameters , to a selection of grbs with well sampled temporal and spectral data .",
    "we attempted to constrain three parameters of interest and to test the validity of the blast wave model for light curves observed by _",
    "swift _ , the complexity of which has made the identification of breaks and the interpretation of the blast wave more difficult than in the pre-_swift _ era .",
    "we find that the majority of the afterglows are well described within the frame work of the blast wave model and that the parameters derived are consistent with those values found by previous authors .",
    "after an inspection of all the _ swift _ x - ray light curves and a comparison with the optical data available in the literature , we identified a sample of 10 bursts that had enough data to well constrain the optical and x - ray temporal indices , and the x - ray spectral indices , of the afterglows .",
    "we analysed these data , fitting power - law decays to the light curves in an attempt to identify possible breaks ; taking into account the possibility of hidden breaks and the effect of host galaxy contribution to the optical , where possible .    in the case of well constrained x - ray spectra",
    ", we show that @xmath0 can be estimated from the x - ray spectra alone , with the caveat that it will give two possible values of @xmath0 ; these must be differentiated by either broadband seds or a comparison with the predictions of the blast wave model , or both .",
    "we compare the observed light curves and spectra of each burst in our sample to those values expected from the blast wave model and find that we can successfully interpret all bursts , except two , within this frame work ; these interpretations require ` hidden ' x - ray breaks in grb060206 and grb061126 .",
    "furthermore , we identify , reasonably unambiguously , jet breaks in 5 afterglows out of our sample of 10 , including a jet break in grb060729 that was not identified in previous analysis of the light curve .    after interpretation within the blast wave model ,",
    "we are able to confidently estimate the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 , for 6 of the bursts in our sample .",
    "a statistical analysis of the distribution of @xmath0 reveals that , even in the most conservative case of least scatter , the values are not consistent with a single , universal value suggested by some studies ; this has important implications for theoretical particle acceleration studies . in a number of cases , we are also able to obtain values for the circumburst density profile index , @xmath1 , and the index of continued energy injection , @xmath2 .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath2 are consistent with both suggested sources of continued energy injection and a much larger sample of afterglows will be required to constrain the sample properties of @xmath2 .",
    "the values of @xmath1 , consistent with previous works on the matter , suggest that the circumburst density profiles are not drawn from only one of the constant density or wind - like media populations .",
