    "the wire - tap channel models a communication system in which a source node wishes to transmit confidential information to a destination node and wishes to keep a wire - tapper as ignorant of this information as possible .",
    "this channel was introduced by wyner in @xcite , where the secrecy capacity was given .",
    "the secrecy capacity of the gaussian wire - tap channel was given in @xcite .",
    "the wire - tap channel was considered recently for fading and multiple antenna channels in @xcite .",
    "a more general model of the wire - tap channel was studied by csisz@xmath0r and k@xmath1rner in @xcite , where the source node also has a common message for both receivers in addition to the confidential message for only one receiver .",
    "this channel is regarded as the broadcast channel with confidential messages ( bcc ) .",
    "the capacity - equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region of the discrete memoryless bcc were characterized in @xcite .",
    "the bcc was further studied recently in @xcite , where the source node transmits two confidential message sets for two receivers , respectively .    in this paper , we investigate the fading bcc , which is based on the bcc studied in @xcite with the channels from the source node to receivers 1 and 2 corrupted by multiplicative fading gain coefficients in addition to additive gaussian noise terms .",
    "we assume that the channel state information ( csi ) is known at both the transmitter and the receivers .",
    "the csi at the transmitter ( the source node ) can be realized by reliable feedback from the two receivers , who are supposed to receive information from the source node .",
    "the fading bcc we study in this paper relates to or generalizes a few channels that have been previously studied in the literature .",
    "compared to the fading broadcast channel studied in @xcite , the fading bcc requires a secrecy constraint that the confidential information for one receiver must be as secret as possible from the other receiver .",
    "the fading bcc includes the fading wire - tap channel studied in @xcite and @xcite ( full csi case ) as a special case , because the fading bcc assumes that the source node has a common message for both receivers in addition to the confidential message for receiver 1 .",
    "the fading bcc also includes the parallel gaussian wire - tap channel studied in @xcite ( the case where wire - tappers cooperate ) as a special case for the same reason as above and also because a power constraint is assumed for each subchannel in @xcite .    in this paper , we first study the parallel gaussian bcc , which serves as a basic model that includes the fading bcc as a special case .",
    "we show that the secrecy capacity region of the parallel gaussian bcc is a union over the rate regions achieved by all source power allocations ( among the parallel subchannels ) .",
    "moreover , we derive the optimal power allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region and hence completely characterize this region . in particular , we establish the secrecy capacity region of the gaussian case of the csisz@xmath0r - k@xmath1rner bcc model .",
    "we then apply our results to study the fading bcc , which can be viewed as the parallel gaussian bcc with each fading state corresponding to one subchannel .",
    "thus , the secrecy capacity region of the parallel gaussian bcc applies to the fading bcc .",
    "in particular , since the source node knows the csi , it can dynamically change its transmission power with channel state realization to achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region .    in this paper , we use @xmath2}$ ] to indicate a group of variables @xmath3 , and use @xmath2}^n$ ] to indicate a group of vectors @xmath4 , where @xmath5 indicates the vector @xmath6 . throughout the paper ,",

    "since fading introduces more randomness to the channel , it is more likely that the channel from the source node to receiver 1 is better than the channel from the source node to receiver 2 for some channel states , and hence positive secrecy capacity can be achieved by exploiting these channel states .",
    "since the source node is assumed to know the channel state information , it can allocate its power according to the instantaneous channel realization to achieve the best performance , i.e. , the boundary of the secrecy capacity region .",
    "such optimal power allocations can be derived from theorem [ th : gauoptsl ] .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "if the source node does not have common messages for both receivers , and only has confidential messages for receiver 1 , the fading bcc becomes the fading wire - tap channel .",
    "for this channel , corollary [ cor : fdsec ] and theorem [ th : gauoptsl ] give the secrecy capacity and the optimal source power allocation obtained in @xcite and @xcite ( full csi case ) .",

    "we consider the rayleigh fading bcc , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are zero mean proper complex gaussian random variables .",

    "[ fig : region_gauss ] , we plot the boundaries of the secrecy capacity regions corresponding to @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that as @xmath120 decreases , the secrecy rate @xmath71 of the confidential message improves , but the rate @xmath70 of the common message decreases .",
    "this fact follows because smaller @xmath120 implies worse channel from the source node to receiver 2 .",
    "thus , confidential information can be forwarded to receiver 1 at a larger rate .",
    "however , the rate of the common information is limited by the channel from the source node to receiver 2 , and hence decreases as @xmath120 decreases .            for the rayleigh fading bcc with @xmath122 and @xmath124 , we plot the boundary of the secrecy capacity region in fig .  [",
    "fig : cases ] . the three cases ( see theorem [ th : gauoptsl ] ) to derive the boundary achieving power allocations",
    "are also indicated with the corresponding boundary points .",
    "it can be seen that the boundary points with large @xmath71 are achieved by the power allocations derived from case 1 , and are indicated by the line with circle on the graph .",
    "the boundary points with large @xmath70 are achieved by the optimal power allocations derived from case 2 , and are indicated by the line with square . between the boundary points achieved by case 1 and case 2 ,",
    "the boundary points are achieved by the power allocations derived from case 3 , and are indicated by the plain solid line .",
    "an intuitive reason why the three cases associate with the boundary points is given as follows . to achieve large secrecy rate @xmath71 , most channel states in the set @xmath114 where receiver 1 has a stronger channel than receiver 2 are used to transmit the confidential message .",
    "the common message is hence transmitted mostly over the channel states in the set @xmath125 , over which the common rate is limited by the channel from the source node to receiver 1 .",
    "thus , power allocation needs to optimize the rate of this channel , and hence the optimal power allocation follows from case 1 . to achieve large @xmath70 , the common message",
    "is forwarded over the channel states both in @xmath114 and @xmath125 . since in average",
    "the source node has a much worse channel to receiver 2 than to receiver 1 , the channel from the source node to receiver 2 limits the common rate .",
    "power allocation now needs to optimize the rate to receiver 2 , and hence follows from case 2 . between these two cases ,",
    "power allocation needs to balance the rates to receivers 1 and 2 and hence follows from case 3 .",
    "we have established the secrecy capacity region for the parallel gaussian bcc , and have characterized the optimal power allocations that achieve the boundary of this region .",
    "an interesting result we have established is the secrecy capacity region of the gaussian case of the csisz@xmath0r and k@xmath1rner bcc model .",
