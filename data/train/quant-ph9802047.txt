    "<S> are stable and no sensitivity of quantum states to initial conditions can be found .    however , there are three strong objections against the use of @xmath11 as a measure of state sensitivity to initial conditions and instability . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the quantum mechanical state space is the complex projective hilbert space @xmath12 that has a curvature not present in the complex hilbert space @xmath13 it is a nontrivial khler manifold with a symplectic form and an associated riemannian metric @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , equation ( [ 2 ] ) is obtained by substituting the classical phase space trajectory distance in ( [ 1 ] ) by a quantum distance . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a mere technical error but a conceptual one as the closest classical object to a quantum state is a liouville density , not a single trajectory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recall for example that in the classical limit the dynamical equation for the wigner function or for the coherent state representation of the quantum density reduce to the liouville equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a definition analogous to ( [ 2 ] ) for liouville densities gives @xmath14=0 $ ] with @xmath15 by koopman@xmath16s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath17 for all possible liouville densities tells us that we can not know from ( [ 2 ] ) if quantum states have sensitivity as this type of measure for classical liouville densities is insensitive to classical - mechanical instability . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , unlike the classical trajectory distance , @xmath18 is a bounded metric , thus precluding the exponential divergence . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose to overcome the above three objections in three steps to provide a working scheme to classify quantum and classical - statistical states by their sensitivity and instability in projective space @xmath19 this sensitivity and instability are shown to be measurable by the different transition probabilities of two nearby states to a third fixed state .    _ </S>",
    "<S> step 1_. a classical density @xmath20 can be mapped into a real hilbert space @xmath21 by taking its square root , @xmath22 the expectation of a classical operator @xmath23 is @xmath24 which means that the physical space is not @xmath21but the space of equivalence classes obtained by identifying @xmath25 for any @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this physical space is the real projective space @xmath27 similarly , in quantum mechanics the true physical space is not the complex hilbert space @xmath28 but the space of equivalent classes obtained by identification of vectors @xmath29 for any @xmath30 the complex projective space @xmath31 classical and quantum states in @xmath32 will be written as @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> we now put this definition to the test . </S>",
    "<S> the approach taken to find the @xmath70-lyapunov exponent has been kinematic and it is expected to be valid for classical - statistical and quantum states . first we show its validity for classical - statistical states and its equivalence to the classical - mechanical lyapunov exponent for several examples . </S>",

    "<S> there is then sensitivity to initial conditions for classical statistical states and they are classified as unstable in the same manner than using classical - mechanical lyapunov exponents for all @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(a ) shows the convergence of @xmath82 to @xmath83 for different values of @xmath81 .    </S>",

    "<S> a necessary feature added to instability for _ mixing _ systems is boundedness that implies , as in the classical - mechanical trajectory case , that the distance between the system state and the reference state is saturated at the value @xmath87 , but before this saturation takes place the @xmath53-lyapunov exponent can be extracted to be arbitrarily close to @xmath88 by choosing a sufficienty localized initial classical - statistical state . </S>",
    "<S> a classical transformation related to the @xmath81-adic map of interest for us in the later discussion of quantum states is the baker s map , a map of the unit square onto itself of the form @xmath89,(y+[2y])/2 )   \\label{baker}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 $ ] indicates integer part . </S>",
    "<S> this map is area - preserving and _ mixing _ with classical - mechanical lyapunov exponent @xmath91 following the same steps as in the @xmath81-adic map , we find the same result with @xmath92 .    we have obtained classical - statistical state sensitivity to initial conditions and instability for classical - mechanical unstable and _ mixing _ maps . </S>",
    "<S> encouraged by these results we now proceed to study quantum systems . to test our definition of @xmath80lyapunov exponent for quantum states </S>",
    "<S> we first choose simple analytic cases , the parabolic barrier and the harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> all states of the harmonic oscillator ( see figure 1(b ) for a gaussian function ) are stable , @xmath93 for the parabolic barrier , with potential @xmath94 and classical - mechanical lyapunov exponent @xmath95 there are stable and unstable quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the most stable ones are the eigenstates @xmath96 and in fact any discrete sum of eigenstates @xmath97 is stable . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , in contrast to the starting definition ( [ 2 ] ) , there is quantum state sensitivity to initial conditions and quantum unstable paths . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1(b ) shows the convergence of @xmath82 to the @xmath70-lyapunov exponent @xmath100 for two states with different values of @xmath101 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the added complication of _ </S>",

    "<S> _ _ classically _ mixing _ </S>",
    "<S> systems for which we will use the classical baker map in ( [ baker ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantization of a classical map is not unique and we consider two quantum baker maps to illustrate two different types of behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> first we understand the map as defined in configuration space , as did mendes @xcite for the arnold cat map , for which a quantum theory can be defined by the unitary floquet operator @xmath102 such that @xmath103 with @xmath104 in ( [ baker ] ) and @xmath105 the momentum . </S>",
    "<S> for this quantum map the situation is analogous to that of classical - statistical states under the baker map and one then finds state sensitivity and unstable quantum paths in the same way . the second quantization procedure that we consider understands the classical baker map in position - momentum space and we adopt the balazs - voros - saraceno @xcite quantization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the new characteristic that interests us is the discreteness of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> as we have already found for the parabolic barrier , it is possible to have stable states made of a discrete sum of eigenstates @xcite even when localized onto classically unstable structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this does not pose a problem for the correspondence principle as for systems that appear classical to us the recurrence times of the quantum states are longer than the age of the universe @xcite . in typical numerical and experimental results </S>",
    "<S> the recurrence times due to the discreteness of the spectrum might be longer than that due to classical boundedness by the energy hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> we relax the mathematical convenience of considering asymptotic definitions and consider coverged values for experimentally relevant times . </S>",
    "<S> observe in figure 1 that nonasymptotic values already give a classification of states by their sensitivity and instability for finite times . </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to study the balazs - voros - saraceno quantum map . </S>",

    "<S> we choose as initial quantum state @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(a ) shows the finite - time @xmath70 -lyapunov exponent for @xmath118 and times shorter than the bounded time @xmath119 and it is found to be close to half the classical - mechanical lyapunov exponent @xmath120 as in the previous examples .    </S>",
    "<S> the notion of @xmath53 -lyapunov exponent introduced in this paper can be measured in many types of experimental set - ups . </S>",
    "<S> it can be measured in optical filtering experiments by the different reduction of intensity of two nearby states . in molecular experiments </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the system state and the reference state can be obtained from the fourier transform of the franck - condon spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , gardiner _ </S>",
