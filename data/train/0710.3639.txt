    "charged lepton bremsstrahlung on nuclei has been studied both theoretically and experimentally for many years ( see _ e.g. _ textbooks  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this process contributes to energy losses of a lepton propagation through matter , which is relevant for many applications .",
    "the similar process of high energy pion bremsstrahlung is used for extraction of pion polarizability  @xcite . in the modern compass experiment  @xcite the muon bremsstrahlung",
    "is used as a reference cross section and for estimates of systematic uncertainties . for this reason",
    "differential distribution of the muon bremsstrahlung should be predicted with high accuracy . that requires to take into account several effects beyond the tree - level born approximation .",
    "so one needs to consider multiple photon exchange with the nucleus ( important for large @xmath0 values ) , electromagnetic nuclear elastic and inelastic form factors , screening of the nucleus by the electrons surrounding it , and inelastic interactions of the projectile particle with the atomic electrons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "besides those , we have to take into account also the vacuum polarization in the exchanged photon and at least one - loop radiative corrections to the lepton tensor . in this paper a new calculation of the latter is presented .    ref .",
    "@xcite gives a comprehensive report on the calculation of one - loop corrections to virtual compton scattering @xmath1 .",
    "the lepton bremsstrahlung on a heavy nucleus we met here is a specific case of the general problem .",
    "results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the compton tensor also ca nt be directly applied to the problem under consideration , since the actual kinematical conditions  ( see eq.([kinem_cond ] ) below ) deserve a special treatment .",
    "the latter includes keeping an exact dependence on the lepton mass and providing numerical stability of the corresponding computer code .    since for this kinematical region we have to keep the exact dependence on the lepton mass , analytic formulae for the corrections become lengthy and cumbersome .",
    "moreover to provide a possibility to impose various experimental cuts , we perform integration over the final state phase space numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give the notation and the explicit expression for the born cross section .",
    "[ sect_corr ] presents the calculation of various radiative correction contributions : the one due to a single virtual loop , the one due to additional soft photon emission , and the one due to double bremsstrahlung .",

    "one gets the born - level photon spectrum in the simple form & = & ( e_1 ^ 2 + e_2 ^ 2 - e_1e_2 ) , = e_1 - e_2 .",
    "we subdivide the contributions of the one - loop qed corrections into three parts : 1 ) the one due to a single virtual loop ; 2 ) the one due to soft real photon emission ; 3 ) and the one due to additional hard photon emission ( double bremsstrahlung ) .",
