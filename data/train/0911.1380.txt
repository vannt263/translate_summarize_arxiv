    "to make discoveries at the tevatron and the lhc , background processes will need to be measured and simulated with a level of accuracy that will be comparable to the signficance of those new physics signals .",
    "there are several programs on the market that can simulate hadronic interactions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy , but the processes included in these programs are limited .",
    "matrix element plus parton shower ( meps ) programs simulate a more comprehensive set of processes , typically at leading - log ( ll ) or leading order ( lo ) , and rely on models to simulate emissions and fragmentation associated with higher order processes .",
    "these programs have been employed regularly for background simulation at the tevatron in recent years , notably in the higgs searches @xcite and the discovery of the production of single top quarks @xcite .",
    "measurements of + jets processes are valuable for two principle reasons .",
    "production provides a hard scale , which , along with associated jet production , is an ideal environment to test perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the leptonic decay of the provides a clean signal for reconstruction of the events , and small background contamination .",
    "the test of pqcd is made by comparing the measurements to nlo pqcd predictions .",
    "+ jets also makes up a major background of many new physics searches at both the tevatron and lhc .",
    "therefore , these data measurements unfolded to the particle level are useful for tuning lo simulation programs which are heavily relied upon to model background processes .",
    "the tevatron measurements presented here of + jets differential cross sections are compared to predictions by nlo pqcd in mcfm @xcite , meps programs alpgen @xcite and sherpa @xcite , and ps programs herwig @xcite and pythia @xcite .",
    "the measurements have either been published @xcite @xcite or have been submitted for publication @xcite at the time these proceedings were written .",
    "alpgen employs the mlm algorithm to ensure jets originating from the matrix element and the parton shower are not double counted .",
    "sherpa is a ckkw - inspired model which uses a reweighting of the matrix elements to achieve the same appropriate jet configurations .",
    "a detailed description of these programs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the measurements are made with the detector , which is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the analyses were performed in the and decay channels . focused on the z+1 jet inclusive events , and differential cross sections",
    "were made in a variety of variables , including many angular variables involving the decay objects .",
    "the analysis focused on differential cross section measurements as a function of , in the 1 , 2 and 3 jet inclusive samples . in both channels ,",
    "the data are corrected to particle level to eliminate the effects arising from detector resolution and efficiency . in order to keep these corrections small , a limited particle level phase space for the measurements",
    "was chosen that corresponds closely to the detector level selection cuts .",
    "some effort was made to keep the particle level phase space in the and channels close , but some differences exist due to the different nature and detector manifestations of electrons and muons . at particle level ,",
    "the is reconstructed using the two highest leptons , and the jets are reconstructed using the runii midpoint cone algorithm with a cone radius r=0.5 . in the analysis ,",
    "the particle level phase space is defined with the following restrictions :    * @xmath4 gev * @xmath5 gev * @xmath6 * @xmath7    in the analysis , the particle level phase space is defined with the following restrictions :    * @xmath8 gev * @xmath5 gev * @xmath9",
    "due to the evolving nature of theoretical predictions , the programs used to compare to the data are not consistent in all distributions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the data are published at different times , and effort is made to always compare to the most up - to - date theoretical predictions .",
    "next - to - leading order perturbative qcd ( nlo pqcd ) predictions are calculated using the program mcfm ; parton - to - hadron corrections are applied to the mcfm predictions , as calculated by pythia .",
    "the meausurements of + jets are compared to different predictions than those compared in the + jets measurements .",
    "the programs and their version numbers are summarized in table [ example_table ] .",
    ".theoretical predictions and their versions for and + jets data comparisons .",

    "particle level differential cross sections as functions of a variety of variables are shown in figures 1 - 13 for + jets events .",
    "figures 1 - 4 and 8 - 13 illustrate measurements that were made in the decay channel , while figures 5 - 7 show measurements that were made in the decay channel . figures",
    "8 , 10 and 12 consider + jets events in the restricted range @xmath10 25 gev , while figures 9 , 11 and 13 restrict this range further to @xmath10 45 gev .",
    "these restrictions are made to reduce the dependence on the underlying event and multiple interactions .",
    "all results are made with + 1 jet inclusive samples .",
    "the results examine the + 1 , 2 and 3 jet inclusive samples .",
    "a good description of the data by nlo pqcd is found in all distributions , taking into account the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "sherpa generally gives the best and most consistent description of the angular distributions , although the normalization of the data is not reproduced .",
    "the description of the data by the lo mc models is mixed .",
    "all lo mc models suffer from large scale uncertainties which impair their ability to make precise predictions .",
    "several differential cross sections of + jet + x events measured with the detector have been presented .",
    "the data are generally consistent with predictions from nlo pqcd , although some lo programs can reproduce the shape of the data better than nlo , due either to their inclusion of higher parton multiplicity matrix elements than can be currently included in a fixed order pqcd calculation , or an optimized tune of the monte carlo .",
    "these data should be useful for continued tuning of these and other monte carlo programs .",
