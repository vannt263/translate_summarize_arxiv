    "in recent times the cosmic ray(cr ) antiproton and positron flux measurements have assumed much importance , as they could signal , according to a section of the astroparticle physicists , to the indirect detection of dark matter .",
    "in fact , the tremendous surge of interest on the very recent pamela experiments centres around this expectation .",
    "it is a fact that the pamela experiment on antiproton production@xcite is , so far , not that controversial as is the case for the positron excess measurements by the same pamela group@xcite . and in a previous publication we successfully dealt with the positron - excess - problem with some non - standard points of view@xcite .    in the astroparticle sector",
    "the observed particles fall under two categories : primaries and secondaries .",
    "the primaries are considered to be those which are accelerated by astrophysical objects of our galaxy and comprise of electrons , protons , other light and heavier nuclei@xcite . in the course of its journey in the space",
    "these energetic primaries undergo the process of spallation on the interstellar medium ( ism ) mainly with the components hydrogen and helium .",
    "besides , they also suffer energy losses by successive high energy interactions in the earth s atmosphere while passing through the earth .",
    "after their production from the supernovae remnants , cosmic rays traverse and propagate in the galactic turbulent magnetic field , experience some deflections and finally enter the earth .",
    "both the spallation process and the interactions of the primaries with the ism give rise to the various secondaries of which the antimatter particles , e.g. , positrons , antiprotons etc .",
    "constitute a considerable part . for antiproton production spallation of secondaries",
    "too might play some role , though for all practical purposes we will certainly neglect such tertiary mode of production .    the concept of dark matter and its coupling to the standard model ( sm ) sector allows some annihilation or decay chains which could be additional sources of both matter and antimatter in equal measure .",
    "but in the general background matter is much more abundant than antimatter .",
    "so , it is quite understandable that the primary component due to so - called dark matter has relatively better chances to be detected@xcite among antimatter cosmic rays . in a way",
    ", this accounts for the increased importance of the antimatter studies in the recent times .    in view of the importance of antiproton research in appreciating the role of production and propagation of primary cosmic rays ,",
    "we have motivated ourselves here to find a compatibility of the various data - sets by using the simple leaky box model ( slbm ) for galactic propagation and using a particular secondary antiproton production model as described in some detail in the next section .",
    "the observations made and reported by various groups like , bess95@xcite , bess97@xcite , bess99@xcite , bess00@xcite , bess02@xcite etc . ,",
    "caprice98@xcite and pamela(2008)@xcite would here be dealt with on the basis of the slbm@xcite alone which is nowadays very much a text book matter , for which no further details about it would be presented here .    in the present work",
    "we will assort the data on antiproton flux measurements and the @xmath0 ratios by bess[1995 - 2002 ] , caprice[1998 ] and pamela groups and try to understand the totality of data in a comprehensive manner with the clear emphasis laid on the latest pamela results .",
    "according to the secondary production model the low-@xmath1 ( soft ) baryon - antibaryon secondaries are produced here through the decays of ( virtual ) secondary pions of which proton - antiproton pairs comprise nearly one third of the total .",
    "bandyopadhyay and bhattacharyya@xcite and bandyopadhyay et al@xcite have worked out the details of the necessary field - theoretic calculations based on feynman diagrams and obtained the following formulae for inclusive cross - sections at low-@xmath1 valid for moderately high to high energies and by the average antiproton multiplicity @xmath2exp[-5.08x]\\ ] ] and @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the antiproton and @xmath6 is the measured antiproton multiplicity . with ( 2 ) we get at @xmath7=53gev , @xmath80.2 for both the formulae .",
    "the points of emphasis about this model are : i ) it gives dynamically a unified picture of both low- and large - transverse - momentum phenomena and admits of no compartmentalization between soft and hard production of particles which is an artifact from the dictates of the standard model in particle physics . the only difference between them , according to this model , is in kinematics and in one additional feature of constituent rearrangement at high @xmath1 .",
    "ii ) it explains the @xmath9 property of high - energy lepton - hadron , hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus collisions and @xmath10 reactions in a nice dynamical and unambiguous way .",
    "iii ) it subscribes to the ideas of jettiness of particle production at high energies in the form of two - sided @xmath11 of sequential arrays of hadrons .",
    "iv ) it explains the by - now established leading - particle effect ( lpe ) in high- and very - high - energy collisions in a very satisfactory manner .",
    "v ) save and except a single parametrization , wherein there is a degree of uncertainty , there is no hand - inserted parameter in the model .",
    "the model proposes a power law multiplicity for high - energy particle production and introduce feynman scaling violation in an inbuilt manner even for relatively low - transverse - momentum region .",
    "for exceedingly low-@xmath1 region a logarithmic nature of multiplicity might work and feynman scaling might be valid under some stringent conditions and some strict restrictions . naturally , this region is very limited and only a case for exception .",
    "vi ) last but not the least , another potential success of the model lies in its ability to explain the very slow rise of @xmath12 ratio emphasized@xcite even very recently .",
    "this section is divided into the following few subsections and the undernoted sub - captions .      in actual evaluation",
    "the model dependence comes into picture for getting values of d@xmath13/de which is related with the inclusive cross - section in the following way@xcite : @xmath14 here we take p@xmath15e as the transverse momenta of the produced secondary antiprotons is assumed to be small .",
    "inserting expressions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , our model - derived formula for inclusive cross - section valid at moderately high energies in eqn.(4 ) and integrating over @xmath1 with normal approximations we get @xmath16\\ ] ] where we have used the low - transverse - momentum upper limit up to @xmath1= 1 gev / c .",
    "it must also be recalled that @xmath17e .",
    "bhattacharyya and pal@xcite have worked out that the antiproton - to - proton ratio is to be given finally by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the differential fluxes of the primary protons and the secondary antiprotons ( @xmath21 ) respectively .",
    "k is the correction coefficient taking into consideration the composition of the primary cosmic rays and the interstellar gas , @xmath22 is the average path length of antiprotons against escape ( @xmath23 as the unit ) , @xmath24 is the mass of the proton ( g as the unit ) , @xmath25 is the total energy of the primary proton , @xmath26 is the integral lower limit relevant to the production threshold of antiprotons , @xmath27 is the integral energy spectrum exponential of the primary protons and is the sole quantity taken from cosmic - ray information and it is used @xmath27=1.75 , x = e/@xmath25 and @xmath28 = @xmath29 ( we took @xmath30 -(@xmath31/e)+[@xmath32 + 1]@xmath33 ) .    usually , @xmath19 is expressed as @xmath34 now using eqn.(5 ) , eqn.(7 ) in eqn.(6 ) we get @xmath35x^{\\gamma-1}dx\\ ] ] here , we have always used k = 1.26 , @xmath36 = 5 @xmath23 and @xmath37 1gev .      at the relatively lower energy sides of ultra high energy interactions , both",
    "proton - antiprotons might enter into some annihilation reactions which would suppress the production ratio of @xmath0 in the main . in order to accommodate this probability",
    "we assume a damping correction term for the @xmath0-ratios to be parameterized by @xmath38 $ ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the chosen parameters and @xmath42 is the measured antiproton energy .",
    "we assume here that only the ratio - values of @xmath0 would suffer this diminutive change as the annihilations involve both the protons and antiprotons , though the individualized production of both protons and antiprotons would be considered to remain unaffected .",
    "the used values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are 0.55 , 0.7 and 0.5 respectively .",
    "it is to be observed that the value of @xmath43 is sensitive to the value @xmath27 and the value of @xmath27 could be different in different regions of the primary proton energy .",
    "but we have left out this issue for the present with the acceptance of a specific value of @xmath27 = 1.75 throughout this entire work . in order to proceed",
    "we have found the relationship between the secondary antiproton energy and the primary proton energy to follow the nature depicted by figure 1(a ) .    in figure 1(b ) , the median energy of primary protons is shown as a function of the secondary antiproton energy .",
    "it was found earlier that for antiproton energies of 3 - 9 gev , which were relevant to the experimental work performed uptil then , the median energies of primary protons were about 25 - 80 gev .",
    "the present energy - region is somewhat higher .",
    "but we take the cue from tan and ng@xcite and proceed in a similar manner to draw the figures shown in figure 1(b ) and figure 1(c ) as described in the figure - captions in some detail . very carefully",
    ", we have chosen a modestly accurate primary proton spectrum .",
    "modifying bhadwar et al@xcite , we use here @xmath44 where @xmath45 is in protons @xmath46 .    using this spectrum and our invariant cross section formulae ,",
    "we have calculated the @xmath43 curve as given in figure 1(c ) .",
    "the final results have here been actually worked out on the basis of the following two deduced expressions : @xmath47 and @xmath48 = \\frac{2k\\lambda_e(e)}{m_p}\\int^{x_s}_0e\\frac{d\\sigma_p}{de}x^{\\gamma-1}dx \\times \\phi \\exp[-\\alpha e_{\\overline{p}}^\\epsilon]\\ ] ] the graphical plots drawn in figure 2 and figure 3 with expression ( 10 ) describe the nature of relatively low - energy antiproton - data measured by bess , caprice on antiproton flux . and the plot of model - based @xmath0 ratio - values based on expression ( 11 ) are displayed in figure 4 and figure 5 against the data - background .",
    "the used values of the parameters are shown in the adjoining table ( table 1 ) .",
    "after delivering the results by graphical plots and the necessary table(s ) , we would like to make in the following section some crucial observations about some very exciting and interesting recent works@xcite which appear to be somewhat concurrent with our views on some aspects of astroparticle physics - divisions .",
    "the final chapter of discussions and conclusions drawn from the present work just follows thereafter .",
    "in the very recent past blasi@xcite proposed an  alternative and even simpler astrophysical explanation\"@xcite for the anomalous positron excess observed and reported by pamela group@xcite .",
    "of late , thereafter the same postulates ( plus mechanism ) of hadronic production of secondaries in aged supernova remnants ( snrs ) and acceleration therein have been successfully applied for calculating the @xmath0 flux - ratio which has been generically predicted to be of flattened nature in the intermediate energy range under study now , and is expected to rise very weakly in the superhigh energy domain . in fact , the initial experimental observations on this ratio in the tev - region corroborate this predicted trend of the data . but",
    "confirmation of this behaviour is still awaited by both the theorists and experimentalists@xcite .",
    "the different probable sources for production of antimatter components , like positrons , antiprotons etc are : dark matter annihilation / decay , secondary production and supernova remnants@xcite .",
    "these three are mutually independent of each other , apparently with no known and perceptible overlapping or intersection .",
    "the snr components are transient sources , in which most of the matter - antimatter particles are accelerated and injected into the interstellar space in a very short time compared to cosmic ray propagation scales .",
    "the difference with the two other sources mentioned above is that those are rather inhomogeneous in the nearby region to the solar system .",
    "normally this kind of source is taken as a smooth distribution across the whole galaxy due to the diffusive propagation of cosmic rays .",
    "however , when sources are too close - on time and distance - the distribution pattern changes and the approximation is no longer valid .    however , that the secondary to primary ratios should rise with energy , if secondaries are accelerated in the some spatial region as the primaries , have been noted quite some time ago in the context of cosmic ray acceleration in the interstellar medium .",
    "this model is conservative since it invokes only processes that are expected to occur in candidate cosmic ray sources , in particular supernova remnants .",
    "our way to distinguish it from the other models is to compute the expected antiproton - to - proton ratio , which is experimentally observed so far to be consistent with the standard background@xcite .",
    "this finding is , in fact , in agreement with the model by blasi@xcite , more particularly by blasi and serpico@xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that blasi s acceleration mechanism applies to a certain stage of the ( old ) snr evolution with some other provisos and conditionalities related to magnetic field damping , time - dependence or time - independence etc .",
    "however , till date , the model is found to be consistent with the measurements .",
    "the commonness in the approaches by us , blasi [ or blasi and serpico ] and ahlers et al lie in the facts that ( i ) all of these models are not based on the assumed / hypothetical existence of the dark matter or , for that matter , decay / annihilation of dark matter etc . ; and ( ii ) there is no concern or consideration about the existence of the pulsars and the role of the emissions from the pulsars . in our mechanism , we confined ourselves only to the ` secondary ' proton - antiprotons .",
    "blasi , blasi and serpico opted singularly for the third source , the snrs , which we did not , at all , reckon with .",
    "so these two approaches might be viewed as parallel to each other . in future",
    ", it is quite probable that a combination of these @xmath49 contributions would be an indispensable necessity to have a perfectly valid explanation for the measured data at ultrahigh energies . in order to confirm / discard any model whatsoever under consideration here , one needs to have very reliable high - statistics data simultaneously on the individual fluxes of both the protons , antiprotons and the ratio - values of the antiprotons - to - protons as well .",
    "the entire data - sets measured by three distinctly separate groups at somewhat different energy - ranges of the proton primaries have here been described in an integrated manner and in a modestly satisfactory way . in our calculations",
    "we have not taken into consideration any exotic source of antiprotons .",
    "so , no specific support to the concept of ` dark matter ' could be rendered by our calculations and method ; rather in a tacit manner the idea is virtually disfavored .",
    "this is in contrast with the contentions of buchm@xmath50ller et al@xcite .",
    "even the probable emissions from the pulsars find no place in our approach .",
    "with regard to all these exoticities , we obviously share the ideas of both blasi@xcite and blasi and serpico@xcite .",
    "we have based our calculations here on the simple leaky box model ( slbm ) .",
    "even our previous work on positron results@xcite by pamela group@xcite was also done with the same propagation model , viz , slbm .",
    "so the emphasis laid on the nested leaky box model ( nlbm ) by cowsik and burch@xcite on understanding the pamela - data related to the detection of positron excess is not substantiated by our works .",
    "besides , the fair agreement between calculations and measurements provides a support to the secondary antiproton production model and the choice of the nature of primary proton spectrum put into use here .",
    "but , in our approach there are a few chosen parameters which can not be clearly accounted for right now from the physical considerations .",
    "this definitely constitutes some strong limitations to our claims on the successes in interpreting the data - trends and/or data - character(s ) .            *",
