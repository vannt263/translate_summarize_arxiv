    "widespread occurrence of signals exhibiting power spectral density with @xmath0 behavior suggests that a general mathematical explanation of such an effect might exist . however , physical models of @xmath0 noise in some physical systems are usually very specialized and they do not explain the omnipresence of the processes with @xmath6 spectrum . mathematical algorithms and models for the generation of the processes with @xmath0 noise can not , as a rule , be solved analytically and they do not reveal the origin as well as the necessary and sufficient conditions for the appearance of @xmath7 type fluctuations .",
    "history of the progress in different areas of physics indicates to the crucial influence of simple models on the advancement of the understanding of the main points of the new phenomena .",
    "we note here only the decisive influence of the bohr model of hydrogen atom on the development of the quantum theory , the role of the lorenz model as well as the logistic and standard ( chirikov ) maps for understanding of the deterministic chaos and the quantum kicked rotator for the revealing the quantum localization of classical chaos .    here",
    "we present simple models of @xmath0 noise which may essentially influence on the understanding of the origin and main properties of the effect .",
    "our models are the result of a search for necessary and sufficient conditions for the appearance of @xmath0 fluctuations in simple systems affected by the random external perturbations , which where initiated in @xcite and originated from the observation of the transition from chaotic to nonchaotic behavior in the ensemble of randomly driven systems @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of our model corresponds to one particle moving along some orbit .",
    "the period of this motion fluctuates ( due to external random perturbations of the system s parameters ) about some average value @xmath8 .",
    "so , a sequence of the transit times @xmath9 when the particle crosses some point of the orbit is described by the iterative equations @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the coefficient of the relaxation of the period to the average value @xmath12 , @xmath13 denotes the sequence of random variables with zero expectation and unit variance and @xmath14 is the standard deviation of the noise .",
    "due to the contribution of a large number of random variables to the transit times , model ( 1 ) represents a long - memory random process .",
    "power spectral density @xmath15 of the signal or current of the model ( 1 ) , @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 being a contribution to the signal of one pulse or contribution to the current of one particle when it crosses the section of observation ) , may be calculated according to equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the whole observation time interval , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are minimal and maximal values of index @xmath22 in the interval of observation and the brackets @xmath23 denote the averaging over the realizations of the process .",
    "( 2 ) may be rewritten in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the difference of transit times @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    at @xmath28",
    "we have the stationary process @xcite : the expectation @xmath29 and the variance @xmath30 of the recurrence time @xmath31 do not depend on the time while @xmath32 is a normally distributed random variable with the expectation @xmath33 and the variance @xmath34 expressed as @xcite @xmath35 .",
    "\\eqno{(4)}\\ ] ] for the normal distribution of @xmath36 eq .",
    "( 3 ) yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the average current .",
    "substitution of the expansions of the variance ( 4 ) at @xmath39 in powers of @xmath40 , @xmath41 into eq .",
    "( 5 ) yields @xmath0-like power spectrum ,    @xmath42 for sufficiently small parameters @xmath43 and @xmath11 in any desirably wide range of frequencies , @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is a dimensionless constant ( the hooge parameter ) , @xmath46 we see that the power of @xmath0 noise except the squared average current @xmath47 depends strongly on the ratio of the average recurrence time @xmath8 to the standard deviation of the recurrence time @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the process ( 1 ) containing only one relaxation time @xmath49  can for sufficiently small damping @xmath11  produce an exact @xmath0-like spectrum in wide range of frequency @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "the model is free from the unphysical divergency of the spectrum at @xmath52 .",
    "so , using for @xmath53 an expansion of expression ( 4 ) at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , we obtain from eq .",
    "( 5 ) the lorentzian power spectrum @xcite @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the  diffusion  coefficient of the time @xmath27 . for @xmath59",
    "we have the white noise @xmath60 this is in agreement with the statement @xcite that the power spectrum of any pulse sequence is white at low enough frequencies .    equations ( 6)(8 )",
    "describe quite well the power spectrum of the random process ( 1 ) for perturbation by the gaussian white noise and even for perturbations by the non - gaussian sequence of random impacts @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( see illustrative examples in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this simple exactly solvable model can easily be generalized in different directions : for large number of particles moving in similar orbits with coherent ( identical for all particles ) or independent ( uncorrelated for different particles ) fluctuations of the periods , for non - gaussian or continuous perturbations of the systems parameters and for spatially extended systems .",
    "so , when an ensemble of @xmath62 particles moves on closed orbits and the period of each particle fluctuates independently ( due to the perturbations by uncorrelated sequences of random variables @xmath63 , different for each particle @xmath64 ) the power spectral density of the collective current @xmath65 of all particles can be calculated by the above method @xcite too and it is expressed as the hooge formula @xcite",
    "@xmath66    this expression with the factor @xmath67 is in agreement with the hooge @xcite statements that summation of spectra is only allowed if the processes contributing to the spectrum are isolated from each other and that only isolated traps yield @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that in many cases the intensity of signals or currents can be expressed as a sequence of the pulse occurrence times @xmath68 , i.e. , as @xmath69 .",
    "this expression represents exactly the flow of identical point objects : cars , electrons , photons and so on .",
    "more generally , instead of the dirac delta function one should introduce time dependent pulse amplitudes @xmath70 .",
    "the low frequency power spectral density , however , depends weakly on the shapes of the pulses @xcite , while fluctuations of the pulses amplitudes result , as a rule , in white or lorentzian , but not @xmath0 , noise . model ( 1 ) in such cases represents fluctuations of the averaged interevent time @xmath31 between the subsequent occurrence times of the pulses .",
    "the model may also be generalized for the nonlinear relaxation of the interevent time @xmath31 .",
    "in such a case eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be written in the form @xmath71 here the function @xmath72 represents the effective  potential well  for the brownian motion of the interevent time @xmath31 .",
    "the steady state distribution density of the interevent time @xmath31 generated by eq .",

    "potential well  @xmath75 with integer @xmath76 we have a generalization of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath77 the steady state distribution density of the interevent time @xmath31 in such a case is @xmath78}{2\\gamma \\left ( 1 + 1/2n\\right ) } .\\eqno{(13)}\\ ] ] for sufficiently large @xmath79 eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) represent brownian motion of the interevent time @xmath31 in almost rectangle  potential well  ( square - well potential ) restricting movement of @xmath31 mostly in the interval @xmath80 with @xmath81 . at @xmath82",
    "such a restriction prevents from the emergence of the negative interevent times @xmath31 and , consequently , from the clustering of the particles or of the signal pulses .",
    "we can evaluate the power spectrum of the processes ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) as well @xcite . the power spectral density ( 3 )",
    "may be rewritten in the form @xmath83 where the occurrence times @xmath26 and @xmath27 difference @xmath84 is expressed as @xmath85 with @xmath86 being the average interevent time in the time interval ( @xmath87 ) and the brackets in eq .",
    "( 14 ) denote averaging over time ( index @xmath22 ) and over realizations of the process . at @xmath88 the summation in ( 14 ) may be replaced by the integration @xmath89 here the averaging over @xmath22 and over realizations of the process coincides with the averaging over the distribution of the interevent times @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the distribution density of the interevent times @xmath31 and @xmath92 is the characteristic function of this distribution .",
    "taking into account the property of the characteristic function @xmath93 we obtain the final expression for the power spectrum    @xmath94 for gaussian distribution of the interevent times @xmath31 @xmath95 and according to eq .",
    "( 15 ) we recover expressions ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) obtained from the analysis of the dynamical process .    therefore , according to eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 15 ) the dimensionless parameter @xmath96 is proportional to the distribution density @xmath97 of the interevent time @xmath98 in the point @xmath99 , i.e. , to the probability of the clustering of the signal pulses . the pulse clustering results in the large variance of the signal  the condition necessary for appearance of stationary @xmath0 noise in the wide range of frequency",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that eq .",
    "( 15 ) represent an idealized @xmath0 noise .",
    "the real systems have finite relaxation time and , therefore , expression of the noise intensity in the form ( 14)(15 ) is valid only for @xmath100 with @xmath101 being the relaxation time of the interevent time s @xmath31 fluctuations . on the other hand , due to the deviations from the approximation @xmath102 at large @xmath103 , for sufficiently low frequency we can obtain the finite intensity of @xmath6 ( @xmath104 ) noise even in the case @xmath105 but for the signals with fluctuations resulting in the dense concentrations of the pulse occurrence times @xmath27 .",
    "we can generate , of course , the stationary time series of the occurrence times @xmath27 also for other restrictions for the interevent time @xmath31 , e.g. , with the reflecting boundary conditions at some values @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the process like ( 1 ) with the reflecting condition for @xmath31 at @xmath108 may also be generated by the recurrent equations @xmath109    numerical analysis of the models like ( 1 ) , ( 9 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 16 ) as well as with other restrictions for the interevent time @xmath31 shows that power spectrum of the current is @xmath0-like in large interval of frequency only when the distribution density of the interevent times @xmath31 in the point @xmath110 is nonzero , i.e. , @xmath111 . for models with @xmath112 or @xmath113 very close to zero we observe in numerical simulations the power spectrum @xmath114 ( see ref . @xcite and fig .",

    "the models reveal main features , parameter dependences and possible origin of @xmath0 noise , i.e. , random increments of the time intervals between the pulses or interevent times of the elementary events of the process .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath6 noise with @xmath104 may result from the clustering of the signal pulses , particles or elementary events can be drawn from the analysis of the simple , exactly solvable models .",
