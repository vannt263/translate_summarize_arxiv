    "high - resolution _ angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy _ ( arpes ) has been used to investigate the lifetime of surface - state holes@xcite .",
    "in contrast to this technique , which is restricted to lifetime measurements of occupied states , it has been demonstrated that _ scanning tunneling spectroscopy _ ( sts ) offers the possibility to measure the lifetime of long - living surface states above and below the fermi level@xcite .",

    "this figure clearly shows that the decay of shockley surface - state electrons and holes in these materials may proceed either through the coupling with bulk states ( 3d channel ) or through the coupling , within the surface - state band itself , with surface states of different wave vector parallel to the surface ( 2d channel ) .",
    "while 3d free - electron calculations of the decay rate of excited holes at the surface - state band edge ( @xmath2 ) of the noble metals are known to predict significantly longer lifetimes than those observed with either arpes@xcite or sts@xcite , recent measurements@xcite have shown that , in the case of surface - state electrons above the fermi level , the experimental values are comparable to the calculated lifetimes of bulk free - electrons with the same energy . that the decay of surface - state holes is dominated by 2d electron - electron interactions , but screened by the underlying 3d electron system , has been demonstrated recently@xcite , showing an excellent agreement with experiment . in this paper , we extend these theoretical investigations to the case of hot surface - state and surface - resonance electrons in cu(111 ) , and show that major contributions to the electron - electron interaction of surface - state electrons above the fermi level come from the underlying bulk electrons .",
    "we also present self - consistent calculations of the screened interaction , and investigate the role that both the partially occupied 2d surface - state band and the underlying 3d electron gas play in the relaxation mechanism .",
    "the contribution to measured lifetimes of surface - state electrons in the noble metals arising from electron - phonon interactions has been discussed in . here",

    "the probe - particle initial and final states are of the form @xmath24 and @xmath25 with energies @xmath26 and @xmath27 where the one - particle wave functions @xmath28 and energies @xmath29 describe motion normal to the surface . using these wave functions and energies in eq .",

    "( [ eloss2 ] ) yields a screened interaction which is close to that obtained with use of the lindhard dielectric function , small differences being mainly due to the fact that the static dielectric function @xmath44 has been replaced by the tf approximation .",
    "contributions to the surface - state decay rate coming from the penetration of the surface - state wave function into the solid are , therefore , expected to be well described by eq .",
    "( [ eloss2 ] ) .    nevertheless , coupling of shockley surface states with the crystal may also occur , either through the evanescent tails of bulk states near the surface or within the surface - state band itself .",
    "these contributions to the surface - state decay rate are both dictated by the screened interaction at @xmath23 points near the surface , where the representation of eq .",
    "( [ bulk ] ) is not accurate .    for a realistic description of the screened interaction ,",
    "we proceed along the lines reported in .",
    "first of all , we compute the single - particle eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a 1d model potential@xcite . this model potential , which reproduces far outside the surface the classical image potential , is chosen so as to describe the width and position of the energy gap at the @xmath1 point ( @xmath2 ) and , also , the binding energies of both the shockley surface state at @xmath1 and the first ( @xmath52 ) image - potential induced state .",

    "3 , as a function of @xmath23 going from the bulk to the vacuum , for @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is the bohr radius ) and for various values of @xmath50 .",
    "we find that at the surface @xmath60/\\omega$ ] is enhanced , for the smallest values of @xmath50 , by a factor of 3 relative to the bulk .",
    "this is mainly due to the strong anisotropy at the surface , which enhances the electron - hole pair creation probability@xcite .",
    "we also find that for frequencies smaller than @xmath61 , the strong anisotropy of the surface does not modify the linear frequency scaling characteristic of the _ bulk _ screened interaction [ see eq.([omega ] ) ] .",
    "however , for the larger but still small frequencies explored in fig .",
    "3 , the screened interaction at the surface exhibits an important enhancement due to corrections to the linear scaling that are not present within the bulk . as a result , for the largest values of @xmath50 that we have considered , @xmath60/\\omega$ ] is enhanced at the surface by a factor as large as 4 .",

    "these calculations indicate that only transitions with @xmath65 are affected by the strong anisotropy at the surface .",
    "we compute the lifetime broadening of shockley surface states from eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) with a realistic description of the rpa screened interaction , as described in the previous section .",
    "although eq .",

    "( [ b1 ] ) of initial and final wave functions that change along the actual dispersion curve of each state .",
    "the effective mass of bulk states has been chosen to increase from our computed values of 0.31 , 0.25 , and @xmath66 at the bottom of the gap in cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) , respectively , to the free - electron mass @xmath11 at the bottom of the valence band .",

    "as the relaxation of shockley surface - state electrons and holes may proceed either through the _ interband _ coupling with bulk states ( 3d channel ) or through the _ intraband _ coupling , within the surface state itself , with surface states of different wave vector parallel to the surface ( 2d channel ) , we also consider the decay of electrons and holes in 3d and 2d uniform systems .",

    "we find that calculations based on a pure 2d electron gas are larger than the actual _ intraband _ contribution to the linewidth by a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "this large discrepancy is due to the fact that electron - electron interactions within the actual shockley surface - state 2d band are strongly screened by the underlying 3d bulk electron system , thereby reducing the scattering probability .",

    "both localization of the surface - state wave function and the presence of the band - gap reduce the linewidth , and therefore tend to compensate the enhancement of @xmath60 $ ] at the surface . in the case of cu(111 ) this compensation is nearly complete , thereby yielding an _ interband _ linewidth that nearly coincides with the 3d linewidth of free holes . however , this is not necessarily the case for other materials , depending on the surface band structure .",

    "we also note from this figure that a large contribution from _ intraband _ transtions , strongly screened by the underlying 3d bulk electron system , is responsible for the large differences between the 3d free - electron gas prediction and the experimental results ( represented by open triangles ) , as discussed in .      our full calculation of the total inelastic linewidth of shockley surface - state electrons and holes on cu(111 ) , as obtained from eq .",

    "interband _ and _ intraband _ contributions to the linewidth are also represented in this figure , by solid lines with triangles ( interband ) and inverted triangles ( intraband ) , and the linewidth of bulk free - electrons with the same energy , as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq106 ] ) , is represented by a dotted line .",

    "7 shows that at the surface - state band edge ( @xmath2 the intraband linewidth represents an @xmath81 of the total linewidth ( see also table i ) .",
    "nevertheless , as the surface - sate wave vector parallel to the surface increases , the surface - state wave function acquires a bulk - like character , with a larger penetration into the bulk , and the _ intraband _ contribution to the linewidth decreases very rapidly .",
    "this conclusion explains the experimental observation that while 3d free - electron gas predictions of surface - state hole lifetimes are too large , they are in the case of surface - state electrons ( above the fermi level ) comparable to measured lifetimes .",
    "open triangles in fig .",
    "7 represent the inelastic contribution to measured linewidths of shockley surface - state holes at the @xmath1 point , which are to be be compared with our calculated linewidth at this point ( full circle ) . since our model , which correctly reproduces the behaviour of the @xmath82-@xmath83 valence states , does not include screening from @xmath84-electrons , differences between measured linewidths ( open triangles ) and our calculations ( full circles ) are expected to be due to the effect of virtual transitions , giving rise to additional screening by @xmath84-electrons@xcite , as discussed in .",
    "the sts measurements represented in fig . 7 by full squares include both inelastic and electron - phonon contributions to the surface - state linewidth .",
    "hence , one must be cautious in the comparison of these measurements with our calculations .",
    "electron - phonon linewidths of typically @xmath85 in cu(111)@xcite , which are essentially independent of the surface - state energy , yield theoretical predictions for the total linewidth that are above the experimental observation , especially for the lowest surface - state energies explored .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment could be partially compensated by the screening of @xmath84-electrons , which as in the case of surface - state holes at the @xmath1 point , reduce the inelastic linewidth .",
    "we have reported theoretical investigations of surface - state electron and hole lifetimes in the noble metals cu , ag , and au .",
    "we have also presented self - consistent calculations of the screened interaction , and have investigated the role that the partially occupied 2d surface - state band and the underlying 3d electron gas play in the relaxation mechanism .",
    "we have reached the conclusion that , while the linewidth of surface - state excited holes at the @xmath1 point of the ( 111 ) surfaces of the noble metals is dominated by a 2d decay channel , major contributions to the electron - electron interaction of surface - state electrons above the fermi level come from the underlying bulk electrons .",
    "this key dependence of the relative contribution of _ intraband _ transitions to the total decay rate explains the experimental observation that while 3d free - electron gas predictions of surface - state hole lifetimes are too large , they are in the case of surface - state electrons ( above the fermi level ) comparable to measured lifetimes .",
