    "the question whether neutrinos are massive is one of the outstanding issues in particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .    among the possible frameworks ,",
    "the `` see - saw '' mechanism @xcite is considered to be the most interesting because it explains the smallness of neutrino masses by connecting them to the scale of new physics . in fact",
    "the see - saw mechanism assumes a neutrino mass hierarchy similar to that of quarks or leptons .    on the basis of cosmological arguments a stable tau neutrino with a mass larger than a few ev@xmath6 can not exist ; however unstable neutrinos can be more massive , so a direct neutrino mass measurement of the order of a few mev@xmath7 would suggest that the @xmath8 is unstable @xcite .    the clearest evidence of neutrinos having mass comes from the oscillation experiments @xcite , even if this kind of experiments can not give the neutrino mass scale",
    ". only direct measurements can do it and the most recent experiments @xcite have fixed the mass of the @xmath9 to be about 2 ev@xmath6 .",
    "however the results of the oscillation experiments must be confirmed before concluding that massive unstable neutrinos can not exist .",
    "the kinematic properties of the observed final state in hadronic @xmath1 decays give direct bounds on @xmath10 .",
    "the best decay channels for a missing mass measurement are those with a high hadronic mass , where the little energy is available for undetected neutrinos .",
    "this kind of @xmath1 decays presents a small branching fraction , so the data sample generally consists of a few events .",
    "high multiplicity decays @xmath11 have been selected for this analysis .",
    "the end point of the invariant mass distribution of the hadronic system , compared to @xmath12 , gives a limit on the @xmath8 mass .",
    "several direct experimental measurements have been done on the @xmath8 mass .",
    "the world s best limit was obtained by the aleph collaboration @xcite with @xmath5 18.2 mev@xmath6 at 95% confidence level .",
    "multi - hadron decays of the @xmath1 lepton @xcite are due to the couplings of the charged weak current to hadrons , which in the case of @xmath13 decays reduces to the coupling of the @xmath14 boson to the @xmath15 current .",
    "we can describe the tau decay as a two - body decay : @xmath16 where the hadronic system @xmath17 is composed by five pions . in the tau rest frame ,",
    "the energy of the hadronic system is used to compute the value of @xmath10 because of its dependence on @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath10 : @xmath19 in the laboratory frame this energy becomes : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the tau velocity , @xmath22 is the boost factor and @xmath23 is the angle between the direction of the @xmath1 and that of the hadronic system in the tau rest frame .",
    "we assume that the @xmath1 energy , @xmath24 , is equal to the beam energy , @xmath25 .",
    "initial ( isr ) and final ( fsr ) state radiation can reduce @xmath24 and will be considered later in section [ sec : section6 ] .",
    "because of the undetected neutrino , the direction of the @xmath1 is not determined , so @xmath10 can not be computed directly .",
    "however , the energy of the hadronic system is helpful because it partially recovers the loss of information .",
    "in fact @xmath26 depends on @xmath27 and it must fall inside the interval @xmath28 : @xmath29 as a consequence kinematic allowed regions are defined for different values assumed by @xmath10 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cinematico ] .",
    "events have been plotted in the @xmath30 plane with their error ellipses .",
    "the coloured lines bound the kinematic allowed regions for different values of @xmath10.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the probability to find an event in the allowed region clearly depends on the kinematic of the decay and on the resonance structure . because both the invariant mass @xmath2 and the @xmath31 of the hadronic system are functions of the measured momenta , a positive correlation arises between these two quantities .",
    "the error ellipses for each event must be taken into account , so that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cinematico ] , event 1 constrains the neutrino mass @xmath10 much more than event 2 , even if the latter has a higher hadronic mass .",
    "this is the advantage of fitting the distribution of the two variables @xmath2 and @xmath32 , rather than @xmath2 alone .",
    "the delphi detector and its performances are described in detail in @xcite . the whole detector , composed by a main central part ( _ barrel _ ) and by two forward regions ( _ end - caps _ ) , covers the full solid angle .",
    "a superconducting solenoid provides a uniform axial magnetic field of 1.23 t. charged particles are tracked in the barrel region using a combination of four cylindrical subdetectors : the silicon vertex detector ( vd ) , the inner detector ( i d ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the outer detector ( od ) .",
    "electron and photon idenification is provided by the high density projection chamber ( hpc ) located outside the od .",
    "for lep centre - of - mass energies of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are produced back - to - back ( ignoring radiative effects ) .",
    "each @xmath1 decays producing one , three or more charged particles in addition to one or two neutrinos and , possibly , neutral mesons .",
    "all particles apart from neutrinos can be detected by delphi .",
    "@xmath36 decays are easy to identify because the two back - to - back jets are narrow and with low charged multiplicity .",
    "the presence of neutrinos implies that not all the energy in the event is seen and the invariant mass of the final state particles @xmath37 is less than @xmath12 .",
    "the background from multi - hadron production @xmath38 at lep energies can easily be reduced since it is characterized by a relatively high charged multiplicity and by a high invariant mass .",
    "final states from @xmath39 and @xmath40 leave very characteristic signatures in delphi and are effectively discriminated .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on the data collected by delphi from 1992 to 1995 ; the centre - of - mass energy @xmath41 of the @xmath42 system was between 89 and 93 gev .",
    "the first step in data selection was to reject all non@xmath44 decay ( cosmics , secondary interactions in the vacuum pipe , etc . ) .",
    "each event has been divided into two hemispheres defined by the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis .",
    "it was required that the reconstructed topology was one charged particle in one side and five in the other ( 1 - 5 topology ) .",
    "events were accepted if @xmath45 , the sum of the momenta of all the charged particles plus the total neutral electromagnetic energy , was greater than 0.09@xmath46 , rejecting some of the hadronic @xmath47 decays , @xmath48 interactions and beam gas interactions . to reject cosmics and to reduce further the contamination from beam gas events",
    "it was required that , defining particles 1 and 2 as the most energetic in each hemisphere , @xmath49 1.5 cm and @xmath50 4.5 cm , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are their transverse and longitudinal distances of closest approach to the average beam spot .",
    "part of the hadronic @xmath53 background was rejected by the requirement on the topology and on the impact parameters as described above .",
    "the remaining low multiplicity @xmath53 and @xmath54 events can be easily rejected by requiring that the isolation angle @xmath55 be greater than 160 .",
    "the isolation angle is defined as the minimum angle between any pair of tracks belonging to opposite hemispheres .",
    ".composition of the selected data sample [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + ( * ) from @xmath56 decays      the main difference between measurements performed at different @xmath41 values is that the selection between high multiplicity @xmath1 decays and low multiplicity hadronic events from @xmath57 becomes easier and easier with the increasing of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "so lep experiments select @xmath58 events more efficiently and with a higher purity . on the other hand , taus",
    "are produced more abundantly at cesr .",
    "cleo collected tau pairs produced at a center - of - mass energy of 10.6 gev .",
    "the analysis was performed using @xmath59 events and fitting the 36 selected events , using the invariant mass and the hadronic energy .",
    "the 95% cl upper limit was @xmath5 33.9 mev@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition cleo analyzed @xmath60 decays .",
    "this channel can be studied better at low energy machine , because at lep photons from @xmath61 conversions are highly collimated and the selection more difficult .",
    "an upper limit at the 95% confidence level of 35.9 mev@xmath6 was found .",
    "the combined result found by cleo is 30.0 mev@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "an analysis with @xmath62 decays was also done @xcite .",
    "this is a useful decay because of the larger branching ratio than 5-prong , and in addition the invariant mass is very close to @xmath12 . from a data sample of 29058 candidates ,",
    "the obtained 95% cl upper limit on the tau neutrino mass is 28.0 mev@xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : cleomass ] shows the distribution of the 5 body selected events in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath32 ) plane .",
    "argus used @xmath63 events collected at center - of - mass energy of about 10.6 gev . performing a fit  only to the hadronic invariant mass ,",
    "the result was @xmath5 31.0 mev@xmath6 @xcite .      at lep energy , @xmath64 events present a typical two back - to - back narrow jets structure .",
    "aleph and opal , as delphi , have analyzed data collected at center - of - mass energy equal or close to the @xmath47 resonance .",
    "aleph obtained two separate limits by fitting the distribution of the visible energy and the invariant mass .",
    "the fits to the 2939 @xmath65 and to the 55 @xmath66 events have given 95% cl upper limits on @xmath10 of 26.5 mev@xmath6 and 22.3 mev@xmath6 respectively .",
    "these two results have been combined to obtain a 95% confidence level upper limit of 18.2 mev@xmath6 , and this is the world s best limit on @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : otherlepmass ] shows the distribution of events in the upper part of the ( @xmath67 , @xmath32 ) plane for the 5-prong data .",
    "also opal determined an upper limit for @xmath10 with the decay @xmath68 .",
    "a limit of 43.2 mev@xmath6 at 95% cl has been obtained using a two - dimensional method in the hadronic invariant mass and energy distributions from 22 selected candidates @xcite . combining this result with",
    "opal s previously published measurement using @xmath69 decays , a new limit of @xmath5 27.6 mev@xmath6 ( 95% cl ) was obtained @xcite .",
    "before the 5-prong analysis presented here , delphi has set a limit with a measurement of the leptonic branching fractions of the @xmath1 lepton .",
    "the 95% confidence level limit found was 66.0 mev@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this method is however limited by the precision of the leptonic branching ratio measurements , and is not competitive with the one described in this talk .",
    "( _ a _ ) and @xmath70 ( _ b _ ) data sample in the fit region from cleo collaboration.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "the cleo experiment had analyzed a very large statistics sample and its mass and energy resolutions were better than lep experiments .",
    "looking at fig . [",
    "fig : delphimass ] and [ fig : otherlepmass ] , it s easy to outline that with comparable mass and energy resolutions , the position of events in the ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) plane determines a `` _ _ luck factor _ _ '' for an experiment .",
    "so , the aleph limit is strongly driven by the two candidates lying in top right - hand corner of the kinematic allowed region .",
    "the most sensitive region of that plane for opal and delphi is empty .",
    "opal and delphi s 5-prong analysis present very similar results .",
