    "high temperature superconductivity was discovered in cuprates in 1986.@xcite the rapid raising of the transition temperature to well above the melting point of nitrogen @xcite shattered the old record of 23  k. furthermore , the fact that high @xmath0 superconductivity was discovered in a rather unexpected material , a transition metal oxide , made it clear that some novel mechanism must be at work .",
    "the intervening years have seen great strides in high @xmath0 research .",
    "the growth and characterization of cuprate single crystals and thin films have advanced to the point where sample quality and reproducibility problems which plagued the field in the early days are no longer issues . at the same time , basically all conceivable experimental tools have been applied to the cuprates .",
    "indeed , the need for more and more refined data has spurred the development of experimental techniques such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "today the cuprate is arguably the best studied material outside of the semiconductor family and a great deal of facts are known .",
    "it is also clear that many of the physical properties are unusual , particularly in the metallic state above the superconductor .",
    "superconductivity is only one aspect of a rich phase diagram which must be understood in its totality .",
    "it is often remarked that there is no consensus for the mechanism of high @xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "this may be true but i must emphasize that a lack of consensus is not synonymous with a lack of understanding or lack of progress .",
    "in fact , i will argue that the basic physics of the cuprate family is well understood . while there are hundreds of high @xmath0 compounds , they all share a layered structure which contains one or more copper - oxygen planes .",
    "the low energy physics of these planes can further be simplified to a model of electrons hopping on a square lattice called the one band hubbard model.@xcite ( many of the details left out in this paper can be found in a more comprehensive review.@xcite ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath6 on a square lattice , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the hopping matrix element between sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 , ( we shall denote nearest neighbor hopping by @xmath11 and further neighbor hopping by @xmath12 , @xmath13 etc . ) , and @xmath14 is the repulsive energy cost due to screened coulomb interaction to put two electrons with opposite spin on the same site . at half - filling ( one electron per site ) , there is a metal - to - insulator transition as the ratio @xmath15 is in increased . the insulator is called a mott insulator,@xcite as opposed to a band insulator , because its existence is driven by strong repulsion and is not described by band theory . the latter would require the state to be metallic at half - filling . the term `` strong correlation physic '' is now used to describe the state of affairs when interaction energy dominates the kinetic energy in controlling the electron motion . as seen in fig .  1 , for large enough @xmath15 the electrons prefer",
    "to be localized on the lattice site because any hopping to reduce the kinetic energy @xmath11 requires double occupation of some site , which costs @xmath14 .",
    "this insulator is also predicted to be antiferromagnetic ( af ) , because af alignment permits virtual hopping to gain an energy @xmath16 by second order perturbation theory , whereas hopping is strictly forbidden by pauli exclusion for parallel spins .",
    "it is now generally agreed that the parent compound of the high @xmath0 cuprate is a mott insulator .",
    "copper atoms sit on a square lattice with oxygen atoms in between .",
    "the electronic structure is simplified to a one band model shown on the right , with electrons hopping with matrix element @xmath11 .",
    "there is an antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath17 between spins on neighboring sites.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    things get interesting when electron vacancies ( called holes ) are introduced into the copper - oxygen layers in a process called hole doping , i.e. a charge reservoir away from the copper - oxygen plane is introduced which removes electrons for the plane .",
    "we denote the concentration of holes by @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is schematically shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the af order is rapidly destroyed by a few percent of holes , beyond which superconductivity appears .",
    "the transition temperature reaches a maximum around 15% doping , which is called optimal doping .",
    "the dome - shaped @xmath0 is characteristic of all hole doped cuprates , even though the maximum @xmath0 seems to be clustered around two groups .",
    "it is about 40  k in the la@xmath19sr@xmath20cuo@xmath21 ( lsco ) family and 93  k and higher in a second family which includes yba@xmath22cu@xmath23o@xmath24 ( ybco ) and ba@xmath22sr@xmath22cacu@xmath22o@xmath25 ( bi-2212 ) .",
    "the highest @xmath0 at ambient pressure of 135  k was reached in hgba@xmath22ca@xmath22cu@xmath23o@xmath26 in 1993.@xcite    before high @xmath0 superconductors were discovered in 1986 , almost all superconductors were believed to be @xmath27-wave bcs superconductors . the requisite attractive interaction to form pairs",
    "is provided by electrons exchanging a phonon .",
    "there were a few potential exceptions in a class of strongly correlated metals called the heavy fermions , but @xmath0 was very low , typically less than 1  k.@xcite . this is why the discovery of superconductivity in a system where the repulsion is strong enough to create a mott insulator was such a surprise .",
    "however , in the intervening years , we know of many examples of non @xmath27-wave superconductors .",
    "these all occur in strongly correlated materials and are clearly not driven by electron - phonon coupling . in the heavy fermion systems ,",
    "experimental progress has removed any doubt about the non-@xmath27-wave nature of a large number of compounds.@xcite other new examples include sr@xmath22ruo@xmath21 exhibiting triplet pairing which breaks time - reversal symmetry;@xcite hydrated cobaltates,@xcite , and several systems near the quantum critical point of a zero temperature ferromagnetic ( uge@xmath22)or antiferromagnetic ( cepd@xmath22si@xmath22 , cein@xmath23)phase transition.@xcite the transition temperature of these systems remain low , less than 5  k. of particular interest to the present discussion is the superconductivity discovered in a series of layered organic molecular solids.@xcite this is because these compounds also live in the vicinity of the mott transition . unlike the cuprates , they are not doped and remain at half filling . in these materials",
    "the effective hopping parameter @xmath11 is sensitive to pressure and to the choice of anion molecules .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 can be tuned right through the mott transition.@xcite amazingly it was discovered that when the mott insulator is destroyed , the system immediately becomes a superconductor , before becoming a metal at even higher pressure .",
    "furthermore , the transition temperature reaches 11.6  k , the highest known among the organics .",
    "there is also strong evidence that these superconductors have @xmath28-wave pairing symmetry.@xcite     materials .",
    "the antiferromagnet ( af ) is rapidly destroyed by doped holes .",
    "the @xmath28-wave superconductor is subject to strong phase fluctuations below the dotted line , where the proliferation of vortices has been detected by the nernst effect .",
    "a pseudogap region extends up to high temperatures in the underdoped region.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    i would argue that 11.6  k for an organic metal qualifies it as an example of a high @xmath0 superconductor !",
    "the reason is that the electronic energy scale for organic solids is much smaller that that for ordinary solids . for example , the hopping matrix element @xmath11 is about 0.05  ev compared with 0.4  ev for the cuprates .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath29 is about the same for both systems . to emphasize this point , in fig  3",
    "i have put both materials on the same phase diagram in the parameter space @xmath15 and @xmath18 of the hubbard model .",
    "is the @xmath28-wave superconductor that appears with doping connected with the one that appears under pressure ?",
    "we do not have the answer at present .",
    "my point is that with so many `` unconventional '' examples , our mindset today should be different from that of 20 years ago , and we should be more receptive to the idea that superconductivity may be a highly competitive ground state in a pure repulsive model such as the hubbard model .",
    "cuprates and organic superconductors in the hubbard model phase diagram . at half",
    "filling , the antiferromagnetic insulator onsets when @xmath15 exceeds a critical value @xmath30 , where the mott transition occurs .",
    "high @xmath0 superconductivity occurs when holes are doped into the mott insulator over a concentration range between 6% and 25% . in certain organic compounds ,",
    "12  k superconductivity lives on the boundary between the mott insulator and the metal .",
    "the ratio @xmath31 is about @xmath32 for both systems .",
    "whether the two superconducting regions are connected is not known and indicated by the question mark.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    with that remark let us return to the cuprates and examine the phase diagram in more detail .",
    "the region between the disappearance of af and the onset of superconductivity is complicated by disorder effects , even though heroic efforts to make pure samples of ybco have yielded interesting new information.@xcite we shall not discuss this region further .",
    "the regions of the phase diagram with doping to the left and right of optimal is called underdoped and overdoped , respectively .",
    "the metallic state above @xmath0 in the underdoped region has been under intense study and exhibits many unusual properties not encountered before in any other metal .",
    "this is shown below the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 and has been called the pseudogap phase .",
    "it is not a well - defined phase in that a definite finite temperature phase boundary has never been found , so the dashed line should be regarded as a cross - over .",
    "there is now broad agreement that the high @xmath0 problem is synonymous with that of doping of a mott insulator .",
    "it then makes sense to focus on the underdoped region , where the battle line between mott insulator and superconductivity is drawn .    since we are interested in the case where @xmath14 is sufficiently large compared with @xmath11 for the hubbard model to be in the mott insulator phase , it is useful to expand in @xmath33 .",
    "the leading order result is the @xmath11-@xmath17 model    @xmath34 p .\\ ] ]    the second term is the af heisenberg exchange between local spins @xmath35 discussed earlier .",
    "the nontrivial part of the @xmath11-@xmath17 model resides in the projection operator @xmath36 which restricts the hilbert space to exclude the doubly occupied states .",
    "the strong coulomb repulsion now becomes a constraint of no double occupation .",
    "compared with the hubbard model , the hilbert space is reduced from four states per site to three , namely spin up , spin down or empty .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath11-@xmath17 model appropriate for the cuprates is also well established .",
    "ev @xmath38  k , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is negative , of order @xmath41 , and is believed to vary somewhat from compound to compound.@xcite    equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are deceptively simple looking hamiltonians which have defied accurate numerical or analytic solution .",
    "nevertheless , the belief among many workers in the field is that they contain the rich physics of the high @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "the situation is not unlike qcd , where the lagrangian is known , but precise understanding of confinement and the mass spectrum has just begun to emerge from quantum monte carlo after decades of hard work . to make matters worse ,",
    "the high @xmath0 problem at finite doping is analogous to the qcd problem with finite quark density,@xcite where accurate numerical solution is so far not possible due to the fermion sign problem . on the other hand , unlike the quark - gluon problem the high @xmath0 problem has a lot more experimental constraint and input . as a result we know a lot about the high @xmath0 phenomenology which severely limits the theoretical options .",
    "let us start with some simple common sense arguments to gain some insight into the nature of the problem of a doped mott insulator .",
    "consider a single hole hoping in an af background as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "after one hop we find a spin surrounded by ferromagnetic neighbors , costing an energy of @xmath42 from the 3 ferromagnetic bonds if the spins are treated as classical @xmath43 .",
    "there is a competition between the exchange energy @xmath17 and the desire of the hole to hop in order to gain the kinetic energy @xmath11 per hole . for large enough doping the kinetic energy wins and we expect a metallic state with some short range af correlation . by comparing @xmath44 and @xmath17",
    ", we expect this to onset at @xmath45 , in good agreement with the experimental finding .",
    "this state should be a fermi liquid state .",
    "there is a powerful theorem in landau fermi liquid theory commonly called the luttinger theorem@xcite which states that the area of the fermi surface is the same as that of free fermions , i.e. , it is determined by the total density of electrons in the unit cell . in our case",
    "the area is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the area of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "this is exactly what is found experimentally . in fig .",
    "4(d ) we show an example of the measured fermi surface .",
    "the precise shape can be fitted with a hopping model with further neighbor hopping .",
    "the opposite limit of a few holes @xmath48 hopping in an af background is less trivial , but by now reasonably well understood .",
    "the competition with the af exchange causes the effective hopping matrix element to be renormalized downward from @xmath11 to @xmath17.@xcite the quasiparticle nevertheless manages to form coherent bands .",
    "the bands have minima at @xmath49.@xcite with finite doping the fermi surfaces are ellipses centered at @xmath49 as shown in fig .",
    "note that the unit cell is doubled because of af ordering and the bz is reduced to the diamond in fig .",
    "applying luttinger theorem to the doubled unit cell , the total area of the fermi surface in the reduced bz is now @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the area of each ellipse ( hole pocket ) is @xmath52 .",
    "physically it makes sense that transport properties are determined only by @xmath18 carriers occupying small fermi pockets .",
    "the theory of a few holes in af background is quite well developed , and recently papers applying effective field theory approach borrowed from the particle physics literature are particularly notable.@xcite    we have good understanding of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . what happens in between ?",
    "here we run into a dilemma . we know that af order is destroyed for @xmath55 , beyond which points we have no indication of unit cell doubling .",
    "if fermi liquid theory were to hold , what would happen to luttinger theorem ?",
    "recall that the nice physical picture of small hole pockets rely on the unit cell doubling .",
    "once that is absent , luttinger theorem forces us to have a `` large '' f.s .",
    ", i.e. one with area proportional to @xmath56 . in that case",
    "it will be difficult to see how transport properties will continue to look as if it is given by @xmath18 holes .",
    "we note that while the original derivation of the luttinger theorem was perturbative in the interaction strength , the modern derivation by oshikawa@xcite is a topological one and relies on very few assumptions , not much beyond the statement that well defined quasiparticles exist . in principle , the fermi liquid can develop a heavy mass @xmath57 so that the conductivity spectral weight @xmath58 , but experimentally there is no evidence of such heavy mass formation",
    ". parenthetically we point out that the three dimensional example of doped mott insulator la@xmath19sr@xmath20tio@xmath23 appears to take the heavy mass route.@xcite    it turns out that nature solves this problem in an extremely clever and unexpected way .",
    "as far as the ground state is concerned , the question is moot because it appears that once af is destroyed the system becomes superconducting and the luttinger theorem can not be applied .",
    "what about the normal state above the superconducting @xmath0 ?",
    "the extensive work using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has shown that the gapless excitations lie on an arc.@xcite anywhere apart from the arc , the excitations are gapped .    ) .",
    "colors indicate the intensity of low energy excitations .",
    "data from plat _ et al._@xcite ( e )  experimental data showing the fermi arc in one quadrant of figure 4(c ) in underdoped na@xmath19ca@xmath20cu@xmath22o@xmath22cl@xmath22 @xmath59 .",
    "data from k. shen _",
    "et al._@xcite , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this situation is sufficiently strange that requires a bit more explanation in terms of the experimental observation .",
    "arpes measures the spectrum of occupied electron states which can be removed by excitations with a photon , i.e. it measures the hole spectral function .",
    "a spectrum is measured at every @xmath60 point . in a fermi liquid",
    "the spectrum consists of a quasiparticle peak at energy @xmath61 .",
    "as one moves along line a in fig .",
    "4(c ) , the peak approaches the fermi energy and disappears as @xmath61 crosses the fermi surface , thus locating its position .",
    "this is how the fermi surface in fig.4(b ) is mapped out . in the underdoped case ,",
    "what happens is that along line b , the quasiparticle peak ( now quite broad ) approaches the fermi energy but stops before crossing it .",
    "instead it loses weight and disappears .",
    "you might say that this also happens in fig.4  ( a ) , if path b misses the hole pocket .",
    "the important difference is that in the case of the hole pocket where there is unit cell doubling , in the extended zone scheme we expect the occupied band to live also outside the reduced bz .",
    "thus if we follow path a we should see a quasiparticle peak appearing at the second crossing of the ellipse .",
    "further along path a this peak will then move down in energy away from the fermi energy .",
    "in other words , the back side of the hole pocket should be visible in arpes as an occupied quasiparticle state rises up to meet the fs .",
    "the surprise is that in fig .",
    "4(c ) , there is no back side to the ellipse , and one is left with what is called a fermi arc .",
    "the spectrum is gapped everywhere except on the arc , and the gap reaches a maximum near @xmath62 . in the superconducting state",
    "the arc also becomes gapped , leaving a single gapless point along @xmath63 called the nodal point . in this way the quasiparticle spectrum of a @xmath28 wave superconductor is smoothly formed out of the pseudogap normal state .",
    "the size of the maximum gap has been measured as a function of doping , and is found to increase with decreasing @xmath18 , in a way which tracks the onset of the pseudogap phase shown in fig .  2 .",
    "( a word of caution : the electron spectral function near @xmath62 , the so called anti - nodal direction , is extremely broad and , unlike the nodal directions , does not show a quasiparticle peak even in the superconducting state in strongly underdoped samples .",
    "so the gap is measured as the pull - back of the leading edge of the spectrum for the fermi energy .",
    "this picture is corroborated by extensive scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) work , which has excellent energy and spatial resolution , but no momentum space information .",
    "the fermi arc and anti - nodal gap is one part of a rich phenomenology associated with the pseudogap phase .",
    "the first evidence of an energy gap comes from nmr data , which found that in underdoped samples the knight shift , which measures the spin susceptibility , does not follow pauli s prediction of being temperature independent , but starts dropping around room temperature and has lost about 80% of its value by the time @xmath0 is reached.@xcite the gap also shows up in @xmath64-axis frequency dependent conductivity,@xcite where electrons move from one layer to the next , but the transport within the plane remains metallic , being dominated by the quasiparticles near the fermi arc .",
    "what is the origin of the large gap at @xmath62 ?",
    "one suggestion is that it is simply a @xmath28-wave superconducting gap and the pseudogap phase should be understood as a superconductor destroyed by strong phase fluctuations .",
    "phase fluctuation is controlled by the superfluid stiffness which is given by the superfluid density .",
    "thus @xmath0 should be proportional to the superfluid density , i.e. decreases with decreasing @xmath18.@xcite this picture is made more quantitatively accurate if the reduction of the superfluid density due to thermal excitations of nodal quasiparticles is taken into account.@xcite the opposite trend of the energy gap and @xmath0 is explained , but the origin of such a large superconducting gap close to an insulator becomes even a greater puzzle .",
    "experimentally this is now ample evidence that the picture of fluctuating superconductivity indeed survives up to much higher temperature compared with a conventional metal : perhaps 2 or 3 times @xmath0 .",
    "however , that scale decreases with decreasing doping and does not reach up to the pseudogap temperature .",
    "the key experiment that mapped out this region is the nernst effect , which is sensitive to mobile superconducting vortices.@xcite for this reason we refer to this region as the nernst region in fig .  2 .",
    "if the pseudogap is not a pairing gap , it presents a great challenge for theory , because while the fermi arc scenario interpolates between the small hole pocket and large fermi surface beautifully , it is not allowed by conventional band theory or fermi liquid theory .",
    "fermi surfaces do not simply terminate .",
    "this is a situation not encountered before in solid state physics .",
    "this is why the psuedogap phenomenon is considered one of the central mysteries of the high @xmath0 story .",
    "we shall return to this issue in section v.",
    "while the pseudgap phenomena is really strange , to a large extent it was anticipated by theory . here",
    "i am referring to the concept of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) introduced by p.w . anderson@xcite and the slave boson mean field theory and elaborations which followed . here",
    "we provide a brief review .",
    "we explained in the last section that the nel spin order is incompatible with hole hopping .",
    "the question is whether there is another arrangement of the spin which achieves a better compromise between exchange energy and the kinetic energy of the hole . for @xmath65",
    "it appears possible to take advantage of the special stability of the singlet state .",
    "the ground state of two spins @xmath66 coupled with antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange is a spin singlet with energy @xmath67 .",
    "compared with the classical large spin limit , we see that quantum mechanics provides an additional stability in the term unity in @xmath68 and this contribution is strongest for @xmath65 .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional spin chain .",
    "a nel ground state with @xmath69 gives an energy of @xmath70 per site . on the other hand , a simple trial wavefunction of singlet dimers already gives a lower energy of @xmath71 per site .",
    "this trial wavefunction breaks translational symmetry and the exact ground state can be considered to be a linear superposition of singlet pairs which are not limited to nearest neighbors , resulting in a ground state energy of 0.443  j. in a square and cubic lattice the nel energy is @xmath72 and @xmath73 per site , respectively , while the dimer variational energy stays at @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear that in a 3d cubic lattice , the nel state is a far superior starting point , and in two dimensions the singlet state may present a serious competition .",
    "historically , the notion of a linear superposition of spin singlet pairs spanning different ranges , called the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) , was introduced by @xcite and @xcite as a possible ground state for the @xmath65 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice .",
    "the triangular lattice is of special interest because an ising - like ordering of the spins is frustrated .",
    "subsequently , it was decided that the ground state forms a @xmath74 superlattice where the moments lie on the same plane and form @xmath75 angles between neighboring sites.@xcite    soon after the discovery of high @xmath0 superconductors , anderson @xcite revived the rvb idea and proposed that with the introduction of holes the nel state is destroyed and the spins form a superposition of singlets .",
    "the vacancy can hop in the background of what he envisioned as a liquid of singlets and a better compromise between the hole kinetic energy and the spin exchange energy may be achieved .",
    "many elaborations of this idea followed , but here we argue that the basic physical picture described above gives a simple account of the pseudogap phenomenon .",
    "the singlet formation explains the decrease of the uniform spin susceptibility .",
    "the vacancies are responsible for transport in the plane .",
    "the conductivity spectral weight in the @xmath76 plane is given by the hole concentration @xmath18 and is unaffected by the singlet formation . on the other hand , for @xmath64-axis conductivity , an electron is transported between planes .",
    "since an electron carries spin @xmath3 , it is necessary to break a singlet .",
    "this explains the gap formation in @xmath77 and the energy scale of this gap should be correlated with that of the uniform susceptibility . in photoemission ,",
    "an electron leaves the solid and reaches the detector , the pull back of the leading edge simply reflects the energy cost to break a singlet .",
    "a second concept associated with the rvb idea is the notion of spinons and holons , and spin charge separations .",
    "anderson postulated that the spin excitations in an rvb state are @xmath65 fermions which he called spinons .",
    "this is in contrast with excitations in a nel state which are @xmath78 magnons or @xmath79 gapped singlet excitations .",
    "-axis conductivity experiment .",
    "this necessitates the breaking of a singlet .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    initially the spinons are suggested to form a fermi surface , with fermi volume equal to that of @xmath56 fermions.@xcite later it was proposed that the fermi surface is gapped to form @xmath28-wave type structure , with maximum gap near @xmath80.@xcite this @xmath60 dependence of the energy gap is needed to explain the momentum dependence observed in photoemission .",
    "the concept of spinons is a familiar one in one - dimensional spin chains where they are well understood to be domain walls . in two dimensions",
    "the concept is a novel one which does not involve domain walls .",
    "instead , a rough physical picture is as follows .",
    "if we assume a background of short range singlet bonds , forming the so - called short - range rvb state , a cartoon of the spinon is shown in fig .",
    "if the singlet bonds are `` liquid , '' two @xmath81 formed by breaking a single bond can drift apart , with the liquid of singlet bonds filling in the space between them .",
    "they behave as free particles and are called spinons .",
    "the concept of holons follows naturally @xcite as the vacancy left over by removing a spinon .",
    "a holon carries charge @xmath82 but no spin .",
    "is there any calculated tool or mathematical formalism to put some meat into the physical picture of rvb described in the last section ? as far as computation is concerned , the use of the projected wavefunction has enjoyed considerable success .",
    "the idea is to write down a trial wavefunction of the type    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is called the gutzwiller projection and @xmath85 is any hartree fock or bcs wavefunction , usually suggested by mean field theory described below .",
    "the role of the gutzwiller projection is to remove all doubly occupied states in @xmath85 .",
    "equation  ( 3 ) is a suitable variational wavefunction for the @xmath11-@xmath17 model because the constraint is satisfied by definition , and its expectation values and correlation functions can be computed by efficient monte carlo algorithms.@xcite the mean field parameters can be treated as variational parameters .",
    "the projection wavefunction gives excellent ground state energy and sublattice magnetization at half - filling , capturing the important quantum fluctuations of the nel ordered state . with doping it predicted correctly the @xmath28-wave pairing ground state,@xcite even though the prediction of the co - existence of superconductivity with af up to @xmath86 is not in agreement with experiment . putting aside the question of whether it is the ground state , a comparison of the physical properties of the projected @xmath28-wave pairing states with a variety of experiments was successfully made.@xcite the trial wavefunction",
    "can be further improved by the lanczos method of repeatedly hitting it with the hamiltonian .",
    "there is some controversy as to whether the ground state of the @xmath11-@xmath17 model with nearest - neighbor hopping only is a @xmath28-wave superconductor,@xcite but it is clear that superconductivity is a highly competitive state , as found by other numerical methods such as density matrix renormalization group,@xcite cluster dynamical mean field theory @xcite and variational cluster approximation.@xcite recently it was found that introduction of @xmath12 considerably stabilizes the @xmath28-wave superconducting state.@xcite at present , i would stay that there is strong numerical evidence that the @xmath28-wave superconductor is a strong contender for the ground state of the @xmath11-@xmath17 model .",
    "what about analytic theory and where does the mean field @xmath85 come from ?",
    "a useful method is called the gutzwiller approxmation , which imposes the constraint approximately by treating the available configuration for hopping and exchange in a statistical basis.@xcite this is clearly related to the slave - boson method which we discus below .",
    "the slave - boson method was developed for the kondo problem@xcite it has enjoyed great success as the best way to undersand the properties of a remarkable class of materials called the heavy fermion compounds , where fermi liquid theory has been stretched to the extreme , with effective mass as large as several thousand times the free electron mass.@xcite the idea is to write the electron operator as a product of the boson and fermion which carries the spin index    @xmath87    with the condition @xmath88 this constraint can be enforced with a lagrangian multiplier @xmath89 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 4 ) is not an operator identity and the right - hand - side does not satisfy the fermion commutation relation .",

    "the low energy physics of this state is that of two 2-component massless dirac fermions with spins , coupled to a @xmath1 gauge field .",

    "this point of view does not help solve the doped spin liquid problem , but does raise and answer the question : what is the signature of a deconfined state .",
    "the answer is that in the presence of a matter field , the only signature left is the irrelevance of instantons , i.e. the total gauge flux is conserved , much like the conservation of magnetic flux in our world .",

    "is there a region of the phase diagram where the picture is less complicated and precise predictions can be made and tested ?",
    "one natural idea is to apply a large magnetic field perpendicular to the layer to kill the superconductivity and ask what is the next most stable ground state which emerges .",
    "when @xmath163 reaches @xmath164 the vortex core overlaps and the core state becomes the homogeneous ground state .",
    "recent experiments indicate that we may be probing this regime and have caused a lot of excitement.@xcite it is believed that @xmath164 for underdoped cuprates is approximately 100  t , well beyond what is available in the laboratory . the resistive transition , on the other hand",

    "recently , shubnikov - de haas oscillations are reported in an underdoped ybco compound ( @xmath165  k ) in the flux flow region , in a magnetic field range of 40  t to 62  t. from the period of oscillation of the resistivity and hall resistivity vs. @xmath166 the area of the fermi surface pocket is extracted and found to contain 0.038 holes per pocket .",

    "for example , a recent experiment on organics observed quantum oscillations down to @xmath178 and is even more striking in that the expected reduction of the amplitude was not even observed.@xcite a rough physical explanation may be as follows .",

    "either the doping estimate is incorrect , or there exists undetected electron or hole pockets .",
    "let me forge ahead and assume that the doping concentrations are actually @xmath204 and 0.10 and correspond to the pocket areas measured in the two experiments and discuss several candidates for the unit cell doubling order .    1 .",
    "we saw in section i that at very low doping , hole pockets appear around @xmath205 in the background of af order .",
    "the question is whether this narrow region @xmath206 will open up in a strong magnetic field and extend up to 10 or 12% doping .",
    "this is probably what most people have in mind when they refer to af in the core and we shall call states of this kind `` doped af . ''",
    "i think this scenario is unlikely . from neutron scattering",
    "we know that there is a sharp triplet resonance at @xmath207  mev in this doping range at @xmath205 and a sharp drop in spectral weight below it.@xcite af order requires the condensation of this triplet mode .",
    "a 50  t field corresponds to an energy scale of 6  mev , hardly enough to perturb the resonance mode .",

    "what is unique about the cuprates ? what is the pairing mechanism ?",

    "the copper @xmath247 ion is in a @xmath248 configuration , making it a spin @xmath3 system .",
    "the layer symmetry breaks the degeneracy of the @xmath28 orbitals dow to a single @xmath249 orbital , so that orbital issues which cause complications in most other transition metal oxides do not play a role here . in most other examples , strong coupling of the charge state to distortion of the oxygen cage causes doped carriers to localize . for example , if we replace cu by ni , la@xmath22nio@xmath21 requires 50% hole doping before it becomes metallic . in many ways ,",
    "the cuprate is the ideal model system for a doped hubbard model .",
    "the parent compoud is one of the few layered @xmath43 antiferromagnet with no orbital degeneracy that is known .",
    "it is hard to find a material that is so simple ! + searching for a pairing mechanism may be the wrong question , because implicitly the assumption is made that pairing occurs via the conventional route of well defined quasiparticles exchanging some bosonic glue.@xcite we know that underdoped cuprates do not fit this description .",
    "instead superconductivity is the ground state which emerges as the best compromise between the kinetic energy of hole motion and the antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "the energy gap is set by the exchange energy @xmath17 while @xmath0 is controlled by phase coherence and is of order @xmath44 .",
    "thus the optimal @xmath0 is set by @xmath17 .",
    "the cuprate family already has the highest @xmath17 among transition metals .",
    "( the ladder compound made up of the same copper - oxygen bond is the only example i know which has a higher @xmath17 than the planar cuprate . ) the hopping matrix element @xmath11 is also large because of the strong covalent bonding between the @xmath249 orbital with the oxygen @xmath250 orbital .",
    "thus the cuprates are blessed with a large energy scale .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 on a few tens of degrees between ybco and the hg compound seems to be attributable to changes in the further neighbor hopping matrix elements.@xcite + if the superconductivity is due to the electronic energy scale such as @xmath17 and @xmath11 , why is nt @xmath0 higher ? as we saw in section i , it is only @xmath251 or @xmath252 for both cuprates and organics .",
    "what accounts for the small numerical factor ?",
    "one consequence of doping a mott insulator is that the carrier density and therefore the superfluid density is small .",
    "thus phase fluctuation is important and limits @xmath0 . in a @xmath28-wave superconductor ,",
    "the thermal excitation of nodal quasiparticles further suppresses the superfluid stiffness on a short distance scale , as seen by experiment.@xcite this reduces the @xmath0 further .",
    "this is why @xmath0 is such a small fraction of @xmath17 . besides increasing the overall energy scale ,",
    "one possible avenue for enhancing @xmath0 is to try to stabilize superconductors with a full gap such as @xmath253 states .",
    "for example , on a triangular lattice , the @xmath253 state is believed to be favored . in this case",
    ", the quasiparticle suppression of the superfluid density is negligible and @xmath0 will be higher , everything else being equal .",
    "2 .   what about other approaches ? why is there no consensus after all these years ? + in a review of this kind which adopts a particular viewpoint ( going under the names strong correlation , rvb , gauge theory , etc . )",
    "i feel obligated to give my honest opinion on other approaches",
    ". this may not be the best way to win friends , but let me proceed .",
    "first let me point out that within the rvb approach there are many variants that have not been covered here .",
    "i emphasized the formulation based on a fermionic representation of the spins and a bosonic representation of the holes . the opposite formulation with bosonic spinons @xcite and a more complicated formulation with flux attachment @xcite has also been pursued .",
    "below let me focus on approaches outside the rvb `` big tent '' by separating the most prominent work into four major categories and discussing them in turn",
    ". 1 .   spin fluctuation models .",
    "+ historically the possibility of @xmath28-wave superconductivity based on the exchange of af spin fluctuations was discussed prior to the discovery of high @xmath0 and a number of workers apply these ideas to the cuprates.@xcite these discussions are either based on random phase approximation treatment for the hubbard model , or phenomenological coupling between spins and electrons treated as separate entities . the latter may be correct in heavy fermion systems , where there indeed exists separate itinerant and local moments , but is more questionable in the hubbard model where there is only one kind of electronic state .",
    "the best chance for this model to work is in the overdoped region , where well defined quasiparticles exist in the normal state and the onset of superconductivity appears quite conventional .",
    "however , from neutron scattering it is known that spin fluctuations become very weak , with spin correlation length of 10  @xmath173 or less beyond optimal doping .",
    "a variant of this idea ascribes the boson being exchanged to the sharp triplet resonance discovered by neutron scattering .",
    "however , this resonance is very narrow in momentum space and carries very little spectral weight , making it unlikely to be the powerful glue needed.@xcite it is clear that in order for the spin fluctuation picture to work , one has to deal with the strong coupling problem and include spin fluctuations at all energy scales up to @xmath17 .",
    "numerical methods may be the only option .",
    "recent numerical studies based on cluster dynamical mean field theory shows promise in this direction in that a pairing kernel was identified in the triplet channel which peaks at @xmath254 and resembles the spin fluctuation channel.@xcite i think the most serious limitation of this line of ideas is that it completely fails to address the pseudogap issue . as we have seen",
    ", there is simply no well defined quasiparticle above @xmath0 to pair them by whatever mechanism . by avoiding the issue of proximity to a mott insulator",
    ", this approach misses the key physics and the most interesting aspect of high @xmath0 .",
    "microscopic inhomogeneity , stripes , etc .",
    "+ the basic idea is that one way the doped mott insulator can resolve the competition between kinetic energy and af exchange is for the holes to phase segregate . in particular",
    ", the holes may concentrate into one dimensional regions where af order is suppressed , separated by an af region where the hole density is suppressed.@xcite experimentally , it was discovered that a particularly stable configuration where the holes form a quarter filled chain ( one hole per two sites along the chain ) separating af regions as an anti - phase boundary indeed exists in la@xmath19ba@xmath20cuo@xmath21 where @xmath211.@xcite this configuration and variants thereof has been called stripes . the stripe explains the suppression of @xmath0 in the doped la@xmath22cuo@xmath21 system near @xmath211 .",
    "it also receives theoretical support from numerical solution of the @xmath11-@xmath17 model using density matrix renormalization group method.@xcite thus there is good reason to believe that stripes form a strongly competitive ground state , especially near @xmath211 .",
    "however , the ordering temperature for the charge order which preceded spin order is low , of order 40  k , and the spin order ( incommensurate sdw ) is even lower .",
    "furthermore , static stripes are seen only in the doped la@xmath22cuo@xmath21 family and not in the ybco family , and in the latter case , even dynamical stripe fluctuations have weak intensities , as discussed earlier .",
    "thus it is my belief that stripes represent low energy physics and emerge as the ground state only as a result of delicate competition .",
    "recently there is a remarkable report that the arpes in la@xmath255ba@xmath256cuo@xmath21 reveals quasiparticles which @xmath28-wave dispersion with a maximum gap of 20  mev , as if the existence of stripes has no effect on pairing of the pseudogaps except at very low energy.@xcite this reinforces my view that stripe order is a secondary effect .",
    "+ static stripes are clearly detrimental to superconductivity .",
    "nevertheless , there has been a strong push , notably by s. kivelson and co - workers , for the idea that fluctuating stripes may be responsible for superconductivity and the pseudogap phenomenon .",
    "i have always found the motivation of this idea puzzling .",
    "fortunately a recent article by kivelson and fradkin@xcite lays out the physical ideas and motivation in a very clear way .",
    "they share our basic assumption that doping a mott insulator is the key question and they share our notion that superconductivity comes from strong repulsion .",
    "however , they reject the possibility that this can happen in a homogeneous phase .",
    "as far as i can tell , the reason offered is that `` the enormous effort has been devoted to numerical searches for superconductivity in various uniform hubbard and @xmath11-@xmath17 related models , with results that are , at least , ambiguous '' and the feeling that if that were the right route , `` unambiguous evidence of it would have been found by now . ''",
    "instead they focused on models where superconductivity from a repulsive hubbard model can be demonstrated , namely the ladder system .",
    "the ladder system can be considered an example of a valence band solid , where spins on the rung form singlets and doped holes tend to form pairs on the rung .",
    "then pair hopping between ladders provides bulk superconductivity .",
    "this is all well and good but kivelson and fradkin are the first to admit ( in fact insist ) that this toy model has little to do with cuprates .",
    "for example , it is hard to imagine how quasiparticles can traverse this system or ladder ( or any kind of stripes ) at a @xmath257 angle and become the gapless nodal particle . as long as this problem is not addressed adequately , i fail to see how this approach can be a viable route to superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "3 .   phonons .",
    "+ electron phonon coupling is typically strong in transition metal oxides involving the @xmath258 orbitals , because of strong coupling to the distortion of the oxygen cage .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in most cases this leads to localization of the doped hole . while holes in the cuprate escape this fate",
    ", the electron phonon coupling must be strong .",
    "nevertheless , we have argued that the dominant energy in this problem is coulomb repulsion .",
    "hence the discussion of electron - phonon coupling must be made in this context .",
    "a combination of numerical and analytic work has shown that short range repulsion has the effect of reducing electron - phonon scattering at large momentum transfer because charge fluctuations at short distance is suppressed.@xcite it is also claimed that under certain circumstances , @xmath28-wave pairing is possible with electron - phonon coupling , contrary to conventional wisdom .",
    "experimentally , phonon sidebands appear visible in stm tunnelling spectra .",
    "all this says that electron - phonon coupling is there ( no great surprise ) but does not provide any evidence that it is the essential driving force behind pairing .",
    "+ the isotope effect is often quoted as evidence for the phonon mechanism for high @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that isotope effects affect @xmath0 via the superfluid density , and not the order parameter itself.@xcite thus the isotope effect in fact supports the view that @xmath0 is controlled by phase fluctuations in the underdoped region .",
    "there is no isotope effect at optimal doping and beyond .",
    "4 .   three band model .",
    "+ since the copper oxygen layer involves one copper and two oxygen per unit cell ( excluding the apical oxygen ) , the minimal microscopic electronic model requires a @xmath249 cu orbital and two oxygen @xmath250 orbitals .",
    "this is called the three band model.@xcite various cluster calculations indicate that the low energy physics ( below a scale of @xmath259  mev ) can be adequately described by a one band hubbard model.@xcite over the years this has become the majority view , but there are still workers who believe that the three band model is required for superconductivity .",
    "i think the original motivation for this view came from a period of nearly ten years when much of the community believed that the pairing symmetry is @xmath27-wave .",
    "it certainly is true that a repulsive hubbard model can not have an @xmath27-wave superconducting ground state .",
    "three band models with further neighbor repulsion were introduced to generate the requisite effective attraction .",
    "the @xmath27-wave story was overturned once and for all by phase sensitive experiments in 1994 but some of the three band model proponents persevered .",
    "in particular , varma introduced the idea of intra - cell orbital currents , i.e. a current pattern flowing between the cu - o and o - o bonds as a model for the pseudogap.@xcite this has the virtue of leaving the unit cell intact and this kind of order is very difficult to detect .",
    "with such a complicated model it is difficult to make a convincing case based on theory alone and a lot of attention has been focused on experimental detection of time reversal symmetry breaking or spontaneous moments due to orbital currents .",
    "unfortunately , the expected signals are very small and can easily be contaminated by a small amount of minority phase with af order . up to now there is no reliable results in support of this kind of orbital currents .",
    "why is the high @xmath0 problem hard ?",
    "why is the high @xmath0 problem important ?",
    "+ one of the ironies about the high @xmath0 problem is that the ground states are rather conventional .",
    "it ranges from af to @xmath28-wave superconductors to fermi liquid as the doping is increased .",
    "the exciting new physics happens at finite temperatures where fermi arcs , pseudogaps and other novel phenomena appear .",
    "this region is not characterized by order in the traditional landau sense , and it is not possible to make precise statements as one could if one has an exotic ground state . from the theoretical side , what we can do so far to classify the pseudogap as the deconfined phase of a gauge theory , where new particles , spinons and holons and @xmath1 gauge fields emerge in the low energy physics . these particles and gauge fields are still strongly coupled and we are not able to compute and compare with experiments in a quantitative way .",
    "we can make various caricatures ( such as local boson condensation and fluctuations between different phases ) which mimic the observations in a qualitative manner .",
    "nevertheless , i believe the problem is so strongly constrained by data that this path is the only viable option at the moment .",
    "i must emphasize that the gauge field is an integral part of this story , and not a technical artifact of our particular formulation . in principle",
    "it is possible to formulate the problem with spin carrying bosons and fermions and holes , and reach the same low energy state described here . in this sense",
    "this proposed solution of the high t@xmath260 problem represents the emergence of new physics .",
    "+ two recent developments are encouraging .",
    "first , it appears possible to probe the `` normal state '' at zero temperature by applying a large magnetic field . while the state again appears to be a fermi liquid",
    ", it may expose a new kind of order and reveal what is fluctuating in the pseudogap phase .",
    "secondly , the elusive spin liquid ground state may finally have been realized .",
    "even though this is an early stage in its development , the study of the low energy excitations of these ground states may finally allow us to access spinons and gauge fields .",
    "the effective low energy theory of the spin liquid problem is also more amenable to treatment because bosonic holes are not involved .",
    "it is our view that the study of spin liquids and high @xmath0 opens a new chapter in condensed matter , one that defies the dual landau paradigm ( local order parameter and fermi liquid theory ) that has been the backbone of our science for three quarters of a century . to me , this is why the high @xmath0 problem is important and exciting .",
    "i thank naoto nagaosa and xiao - gang wen for their collaboration on many of the topics discussed here and i am particularly grateful to t. senthil for sharing his insights and for helping shape many of the thoughts that have gone into this review .",
