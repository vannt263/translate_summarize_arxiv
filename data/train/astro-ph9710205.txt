    "a fraction of planetary nebulae ( pne ) show small scale structures which differ considerably from their surroundings in either line ratios or radial velocity or both .",
    "when these appear in pairs in along the symmetry axis of the nebulae they are often referred to as ` ansae ' , or when there is a clear velocity difference , by the acronym of fliers ( fast low ionization emission regions ) , first introduced by @xcite . the defining observational properties of fliers",
    "are that they should be bright in low ionization lines , located along the major axis of the pne , and have a higher velocity than their environment .",
    "there are many cases which fulfill the first two criteria but for which no kinematic data is available , leaving their status as fliers uncertain .",
    "examples of these can be found in @xcite , who took ratios of h@xmath0+[n ii ] to [ o iii ] to bring out many low ionization regions in pne .",
    "often the ansae are only marginally resolved in ground based images ; in some cases they are clearly elongated into ` tails ' . in some other cases",
    "one observes a whole series of ansae , as for example in fg  1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for reviews on what appear to be collimated outflows from pne .    among the best studied fliers are the ones in ngc  3242 , ngc  6543 , ngc  6826 ,",
    "ngc  7009 , and ngc  7662 , and these are the ones that have also been selected for imaging with the _ hst _",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ground based studies of the kinematics of the fliers in these pne can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities of these fliers are typically around 30 to 50  km  s@xmath1 . @xcite and @xcite  ( 1994 ) studied their spectroscopic properties in some detail .",
    "they found that the derived densities and temperatures are not very different from those of the environment , a surprising result given their conspicuous appearance in the low ionization lines .",
    "the higher ionization species are found at the side facing the star , indicating that photo - ionization determines the ionization stratification . because of the observed velocities one would expect a bow shock ( and higher ionization species associated with it ) at the end facing away from the star , but this is not observed .",
    "the _ hst _ results ( a preview of which can be found in @xcite ) show a considerable amount of detail and the analysis has not yet been completed .",
    "the images seem to show little arcs either pointing towards or away from the star , and more diffuse regions also pointing both towards and away from the star .",
    "the actual configuration of the fliers is not at all clear .",
    "the groundbased observations suggested fast moving clumps being photo - ionized from behind , but the morphologies seen in the _ hst _ images do not seem to support this .",
    "the tails pointing away from the stars ( very clearly seen in ngc  3242 ) , suggest rather the reverse : a clump being hit by a wind from behind .",
    "however there is no other evidence for such a wind . at this point",
    "it seems hard to propose a definite model for the fliers .",
    "one of the surprising properties of the fliers is their brightness in [ n  ii ] .",
    "the [ n  ii]@xmath2 line is normally as strong as or stronger than the nearby h@xmath0 line .",
    "this is usually interpreted as being due to a high nitrogen abundance , which implies that the fliers were formed from stellar material enriched through the cno - cycle . to study the structure of fliers we developed a hydrodynamics code which includes the most relevant micro - physical processes , such as radiative cooling and photo - ionization .",
    "but as was stated above it is not clear what to choose for initial conditions .",
    "there appear to be two cases which could be used as a flier model .",
    "both involve a dense clump moving away from the central star , but in the one case the clump is moving faster than its environment , and in the other slower . the first case is the ` classical ' flier model , but the new _ hst _ results support the second model .",
    "what both cases have in common is the gradual photo - ionization of the clump .",
    "we therefore decided to study this effect first , for the moment neglecting the effect of any velocity difference with the environment .",
    "in fact , the photo - ionization will cause an acceleration of the clump due to the so called rocket effect ( @xcite  1995 ) .",
    "if the rocket effect is very efficient , it might not even be necessary to invoke a wind ; the clump would reach flier - like velocities within its life time ( @xmath3  years , see balick et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "we therefore study here the evolution of a dense clump being photo - ionized by the stellar radiation . in sect .  2 we present an analytic model for the shape and evolution of such a clump . in sect",
    "3 we describe the numerical method that we used to compute the models shown in sect .  4 . in sect .",
    "5 we compare the numerical results to the analytic ones , and in sect .",
    "6 we compare them to the observations . in sect .",
    "7 we summarize the conclusions of the paper .",
    "the evolution of a dense clump being photo - ionized consists of two phases , the collapse or implosion phase and the cometary phase .",
    "these processes have been studied by many authors , starting with @xcite  ( 1955 ) .",
    "the three most recent papers are those of @xcite on the collapse phase , @xcite on the cometary phase and @xcite on both .",
    "the introduction in @xcite contains a good review of all the previous work .    in the collapse phase an ionization front of type d forms , preceded by a shock wave which travels through the clump , gradually compressing , accelerating and heating it . at the ionization front",
    ", material is ionized and thrown out in a photo - evaporation flow .",
    "once the shock has moved through the entire clump , it enters the cometary phase in which the whole clump starts to accelerate due to the rocket effect caused by the photo - evaporation flow .",
    "let us consider the initial acceleration of a spherical clump by the interaction with the impinging ionizing radiation field .",
    "the clump has an initial mass @xmath4 , density @xmath5 , radius @xmath6 and sound speed @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the mass of the shocked material and @xmath9 its velocity ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the equation of motion of this mass is @xmath10 and the equation of mass conservation is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the shock velocity , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the effective areas of the ionization front and the shock front ( respectively ) , shown schematically in fig .",

    "the shock goes through the diameter of the clump in a time @xmath34 after which the cometary phase starts ( described in the next subsection ) .",
    "we now show that by time @xmath35 a substantial amount of the clump material has already been photoionized .    0.1 cm    using the @xmath21 approximation in eq .",
    "[ masscoll ] , one can conclude that the ratio between the neutral clump mass at the end of this phase , @xmath36 , and its initial mass is @xmath37    the mass @xmath38 of the clump can be obtained from the differential equation @xmath39 in order to integrate this equation , let us consider the length @xmath40 associated with the area @xmath13  : @xmath41 .",
    "then , for a uniform density clump we have @xmath42 , and therefore we can write @xmath43 where we assume that @xmath44 is constant with time . however , this assumption of a constant @xmath44 is only strictly true for a clump of time - independent average density , which is not the case as the clump has both undisturbed and shocked components ( see fig .  [ sketch ] ) of different densities , and the proportion of mass in these two components evolves with time .",

    "our description of the cometary regime is quite similar to the analytic solution derived by @xcite .",
    "the model described by these authors differs from the present one in the following ways    * while the present model considers that the incident radiation field has a planar geometry , the dilution due to a spherical divergence was included by @xcite , * while @xcite consider the effects of the photo - evaporation flow on the impinging radiative field only in the high absorption limit ( where @xmath121 ) , our model includes the transition to the low absorption @xmath122 regime that occurs for low values of @xmath92 ( see eqs .",

    "to numerically study the evolution of a photo - evaporating clump we used the code described in @xcite , adding photo - ionization to the processes included in the routines dealing with the radiation and ionization physics .",
    "this code ( called _ coral _ ) solves the euler equations by using a van leer flux - splitting algorithm combined with an adaptive grid method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation physics part is dealt with using operator splitting , meaning that it is solved for separately from the hydrodynamics each time step .",
    "we follow the non - equilibrium evolution of the ionic abundances of h  i  ii , he  i  iii , c  ii ",
    "vi , n  i  vi , o  i  vi , ne  i  vi , s  ii  vi .",
    "we assume that c  i and s  i do not occur due to the abundance of photons below 13.6  ev .",
    "some of the ionic abundances are derived by normalizing to the total abundance of the given element ( he  iii , c  ii , n  i , o  i , ne  i , s  ii ) .",
    "compared to @xcite we have added nitrogen to the list of elements included since the nitrogen lines are so prominent in the fliers .",
    "the ionic abundances are determined by the recombination rates due to radiative , dielectronic and charge exchange recombinations , and the ionization rates due to collisional ionization , charge exchange , and photo - ionization .",
    "for the metals all of these except the photo - ionization rate are found from two - dimensional tables in temperature and electron density , calculated using the atomic data specified in @xcite . for nitrogen",

    "this is then used to calculate the new ionic abundances for the metals iterating a series of two - ionization state solutions .    using the updated ionic abundances we calculate the heating rate due to photo - ionization of h  i , and he  i  ii , and the cooling rate due to line cooling of h  i  ii , c  ii ",

    "tables for nitrogen were compiled from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the heating and cooling rates are used to calculate a new temperature .",
    "this whole procedure is iterated several times in order to find the average value of the temperature during the time step .",
    "the photo - ionization rates are found from the integrals over the stellar spectrum weighted with the photo - ionization cross section of the species under consideration .",
    "the heating rates are similar but have the extra factor of the excess photon energy over the ionization threshold value @xmath123 .",
    "the treatment of these integrals is similar to the approach described in @xcite .",

    "these formulae assume that the cross - sections behave as powerlaws with index 2.8 for h  i and he  ii . for he",
    "i we use an index of 1.7 which is accurate between 24.6  ev and 45  ev , and at 54.4  ev gives only a @xmath137% overestimate of the cross section ( @xcite ) .    storing the values for the three frequency ranges for 40 optical depths ranging logarithmically from @xmath138 to @xmath139 , we only need to calculate the integrals once and afterwards interpolate in the tables . by using the approximation of @xcite",
    "we correctly describe the hardening of the spectrum close to an ionization front and the effects of the presence of he , and thus improve on the approach described in @xcite , without having to recalculate the integrals every time step .",

    "we ran a simulation of the evolution of a clump using the method described above .",

    "the area in the shadow of the clump is recombining and cooling , which means that it is no longer in pressure equilibrium with the rest of the environment material . it is slowly being compressed and heated ; this is more apparent at later times .",
    "the compression through the shockwave is about a factor 5 , leading to densities of about @xmath155  @xmath140 in the shocked part of the clump .",
    "the temperature in that part is a little under @xmath139  k , not enough to produce appreciable collisional ionization , and the material is therefore almost completely neutral .",

    "the shadow region has become more compressed , and there is a small part at the front of the plasmon which actually has formed from environmental shadow material .",
    "the velocity arrows show that the clump has started to accelerate , as is also witnessed by the fact that the photo - evaporation flow on the top of the plasmon leaves it at an angle . in the rest frame of the clump",

    "years this shift is about 7  km  s@xmath1 , at @xmath157  years , 17  km  s@xmath1 . at @xmath157  years the line profile clearly deviates from thermal , showing a low velocity tail .",
    "the observed line profiles in [ n  ii ] are typically 30  km  s@xmath1 wide , perhaps due to the fact that we see an ensemble of evaporating clouds .",
    "assuming that the clump is initially moving with the same velocity as the environment , this environmental velocity should be added to obtain the space velocities of the clump .",
    "the value of the environmental velocity depends on the kinematics of the nebula , but for elliptical pne can be estimated to lie between 10 and 50  km  s@xmath1 , which gives absolute flier velocities in the range 3070  km  s@xmath1 , close to the observed values . as we saw in sect .  5",

    "higher velocities are achieved later on , but by this time only a tiny fraction of the original mass is left .",
    "the plasmon reaches a velocity of 100  km  s@xmath1 when only 1% of the original mass remains .",
    "one would need to start with very massive clumps ( @xmath182 ) in order to explain fliers whose velocity differs by more than 30  km  s@xmath1 from their immediate environment . for those an additional acceleration mechanism is needed , for example a high initial clump velocity or a fast wind flowing past the clump .",
    "we intend to explore models of these types of flow in future papers .",
    "we studied the evolution of a dense clump in the radiation field of a hot central star of a pn using both a simple analytic approach and a detailed numerical model .",
    "we compared the results to each other and to the observations of fliers .",
    "the main conclusions from this are :    1 .   the evolution of an accelerating , photo - evaporating spherical clump can be described by a relatively simple analytic model which gives both the velocity , the mass and the shape of the clump with time .",
    "2 .   when comparing this solution with a detailed numerical model we find an excellent agreement , implying that the simple analytic model does indeed give a good description of the evolution of such a photo - evaporating clump .",
    "3 .   the synthesized observations compiled from the numerical model can reproduce many features of fliers , such as typical line strengths ( especially the strong [ n  ii ] lines ) , the average velocity difference with the environment , and perhaps the morphology .",
    "the reproduction of strong [ n  ii ] lines is noteworthy since we use standard abundances .",
    "we therefore conclude that the photo - evaporating clump model is moderately successful in explaining the flier phenomenon",
    ". however , some of the morphological features seen in the _ hst _ observations definitely need further studying and modelling .",
    "the model we studied here does not address the origin of the clump .",
    "given that the fliers lie along the major axis of the pn , it is logical to assume that their origin is related to the cause of the asphericity of the nebula .",
    "there are then two options , either the clump was formed very near the star , perhaps through some process involving a disk or a jet ( see @xcite and references therein ) , or during the early phases of the interaction between the stellar fast wind and the surrounding material ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first explanation received some support from the reported high nitrogen abundances , but as was shown here , as well as in @xcite and @xcite , the nitrogen abundance does not need to be exceptional if one assumes the fliers to contain an ionization front .",
    "recent _ nicmos _ results on the proto - pn crl  2688 seem to indicate that dense knots indeed form during the proto - pn phase .",
    "the analytic solution we derived applies to any photo - evaporating clump , and could therefore be applied to other cases such as the cometary globules found in the helix nebula ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and dense knots near massive stars in star formation regions .",
