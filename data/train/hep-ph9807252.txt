    "the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium is one of the most commonly used when discussing the system created in central collisions of two relativistic nuclei .",
    "it is by no means obvious , however , that the equilibration actually can be achieved , since it is recognized as a process which may take longer time than the life time of the system in question .",
    "be it or not , it is certainly important to verify if the created system is indeed in thermal equilibrium . to test this",
    ", one needs to check if the various measured quantities do satisfy the relations following from thermodynamics . in the present note",
    "we discuss the possibility of testing the relations @xcite @xmath0 and , with @xmath1 denoting the chemical potential , @xmath2 which should be valid in any system at thermal equilibrium .",
    "testing ( [ 1.1 ] ) requires measurement of the temperature @xmath3 , the energy @xmath4 , the number of particles @xmath5 and the entropy @xmath6 of the system in question .",
    "it is clear that by measuring the energies of the particles created in the collision we can measure the energy of the system .",
    "it is also generally accepted that by measuring the slope in the transverse momentum distribution we can measure the temperature .",
    "the real difficulty is the measurement of entropy . in the present note",
    "we propose to adapt to this end the concidence method proposed some time ago by ma @xcite .",
    "we also present monte carlo estimates of the feasibility of the method , based on a simple model .",
    "we conclude that the method has a large potential , as it requires much smaller number of events ( @xmath7 ) , then the conventional approach . as a consequence",
    "its errors are significantly reduced compared to the simple - minded estimates .",
    "it is certainly worth to employ it in the present and future high energy experiments .",
    "below we give a summary of the idea presented in @xcite .",
    "ma proposes to count the pairs of configurations of the investigated system .",
    "call @xmath8 the number of pairs of `` identical '' configurations .",
    "call @xmath9 the total number of pairs of configurations .",
    "if all configurations considered are `` equivalent '' ( i.e. if they correspond to the same conditions ) , then entropy is given by the formula @xmath10 the reason is that @xmath11 is the volume in the phase - space occupied by the system .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "suppose that the phase - space is divided in cells .",
    "suppose furthermore that our system occupies @xmath12 cells ( with uniform probability ) .",
    "each cell represents a different state of the system ( each cell has as many dimensions as is the number of variables describing the system ) .",
    "our problem is to calculate @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "let us select randomly @xmath14 configurations of the system ( in general @xmath15 , that s the main point ) .",
    "these configurations occupy some cells .",
    "the average occupation number of a cell is @xmath16 . under this condition ,",
    "the avergae number of pairs in the same cell is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of pairs selected .",
    "the total number of coincidences is the sum of ( [ 2.1a ] ) over all cells @xmath19 hence @xmath20 and thus ( [ 2.1 ] ) . )",
    "is only approximate .",
    "the exact formula is @xmath21 which leads again to ( [ 2.1c ] ) . ]    if the configurations are not equivalent , one has to divide them into classes : within each class they are now equivalent",
    ". if the probability distribution of classes is @xmath22 , then @xmath23 the derivation is given in @xcite but it can be easily understood as a sum of the `` average over classes '' @xmath24 and of the `` entropy of the distribution of classes '' @xmath25 $ ]",
    ".    the classes can not be too small , so that number of configurations in each class is sufficient to make a reasonable statistics .",
    "this is what we retain from ma . in the next section we present a suggestion how to apply this method to measure the entropy of a system of particles produced in high energy interactions",
    "a natural possibility to apply the coincidence method to multiparticle production is to identify the configurations of the statistical system with the events observed in experiment .",
    "once this is accepted , one can proceed as follows .",
    "\\(a ) select @xmath14 events and split them into classes according to the total transverse energy @xmath4 and multiplicity @xmath5 recorded .",
    "the number of events in each class is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "\\(b ) define a `` lattice '' in momentum space ( e.g. rapidity , azimuth and @xmath27 ) of individual particles .    within each class :    \\(i ) call the two configurations `` identical '' if they have the same occupation numbers within the accuracy of the grid . the number of such pairs is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "\\(ii ) calculate the ratio ( [ 2.2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath26 is the number of events in a given class .    actually , the condition that the events in one `` equivalence class '' must have strictly the same multiplicity ( otherwise they could never be really identical ) could be relaxed , e.g. by accepting that in the definition of the `` identity '' of the two configurations , the occupation numbers may differ by a small amount .",
    "if this procedure is going to have any sense , the results should depend on the lattice spacing @xmath30 in a trivial way : when @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( once the spacing is small enough ) .",
    "this must be checked , of course .",
    "also question of size of the energy bins must be analysed . again , the result should depend on the chosen size of the energy bins in a trivial way : if the size of the energy bin @xmath33 changes into @xmath34 the entropy @xmath6 changes into @xmath35 .",
    "but this is delicate : the bins should be small enough so that within a bin the energy may be considered constant but large enough so that there is a reasonable statistics within each bin .",
    "same applies to the multiplicity .",
    "one sees from these arguments that in this way one can measure the entropy only up to an additive constant .",
    "therefore the interesting thing is not to measure the absolute value of entropy but rather its dependence on energy or multiplicity .    as we already noted in the introduction , the measurement described by ( [ 2.3 ] ) allows one to perform a simple test of thermalization . when thermodynamics is valid , then the eqs.([1.1],[1.2 ] ) should be satisfied .",
    "clearly the additive constant is irrelevant .",
    "one needs , however , a rather precise measurements because otherwise the numerical estimates of the derivatives @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not reliable . in the next section",
    "we show the results of a simple monte carlo estimate of the accuracies one can achieve .",
    "of course the main problem is for how big systems the coincidence method works in practice .",
    "the number of states grows exponentially with the number of particles and the number of subdivisions .",
    "therefore obviously there is a limit to what one can achieve with the finite computer .",
    "we will show here however that , the onset of the thermodynamic behaviour occurs still for the sizes where the coincidence method is feasible practically .",
    "second , we will also show what must be the _ minimal _ size of the system for the continuum behaviour to set in .",
    "for very small number of subdivisions the coincidence method and our monte carlo are quickly convergent , however they converge to the correct description of the discrete problem , which is far from the continuum , hence not interesting .",
    "we consider the classical gas of noninteracing , nonrelativistic particles in @xmath38 dimensions .",
    "since , as mentioned earlier , the method may be applied to the transverse degrees of freedom only we prefer to retain the discussion in arbitrary dimensions . for the same reason we will use the number of degrees of freedom @xmath39 to characterise the size of a system",
    "of course @xmath40 in @xmath38 dimensions .",
    "since for noninteracting particles momentum and space degrees of freedom factorize , we consider for simplicity only the momentum states .",
    "the discretized expression for the number of states of @xmath39 degrees of freedom with the total energy e reads @xmath41 where the momentum @xmath42 with some discretization scale @xmath30 .",
    "accordingly @xmath43 , where the integer @xmath44 labels the energy of the system and @xmath45 denotes the mass of a particle .    the generating function @xmath46 factorizes and",
    "is expressed by a single sum @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath12 can now be simply obtained by calculating recursively expansion of the @xmath48 from that of @xmath47 , and subsequently expansion of @xmath49 from that of @xmath50 .",
    "this procedure provided us with the exact numbers for the density of states @xmath51 , which were used to benchmark the performance of our monte carlo .    for large @xmath44 and @xmath39",
    "the density of states reaches its continuum limit @xmath52 we will see later that this relation is rather well satisfied even for moderate values of @xmath44 and @xmath39 .    on the other hand , _ the thermodynamic _",
    "limit , @xmath53-fixed , is reached rather slowly . in this limit",
    "the entropy density scales depending only on the energy density @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 the purpose of this exercise is to see if the coincidence method can detect this behaviour .      in principle one should generate a sample of @xmath14 _ configurations _",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 of , integer - valued , one - dimensional momenta @xmath58 , which satisfy the energy conservation . for our purpose , however , the details of particle kinematics , although practically cumbersome , are not relevant . in order to measure the coincidences , it is enough to label uniquely all multiparticle states and compare the labels . in this way",
    "the problem simplifies considerably , yet the essential question of the onset of the thermodynamic behaviour can be addressed .",
    "consequently each monte carlo run consisted of a generation of a sample of @xmath14 configurations , represented by integer indices , @xmath59 , uniformly distributed in the whole space of available states .",
    "then we counted the number of coincidences @xmath60 , i.e. , the number of pairs @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "the estimate for the number of all states is then @xmath63 moreover assuming the multinomial distribution of @xmath14 integers among @xmath12 bins we have calculated also the higher moments of the distribution of the number of coincidencies @xmath8 . in particular , the dispersion of @xmath8 reads ] @xmath64=2<n_c>=\\frac{2{{\\cal n}}^2}{\\gamma } ,   \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] which gives for the relative error of the determination of @xmath12 after @xmath14 trials @xmath65}}{\\gamma}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\gamma}}{{{\\cal n}}}. \\label{erth}\\ ] ] therefore the estimate of the error , based on the mc data only , is @xmath66/\\hat{\\gamma}=\\sqrt{2/\\hat{n}_c}. \\label{err}\\ ] ] eqs.([esti],[erth ] ) show directly another advantage of the coincidence method .",
    "namely , it works for much smaller number of trials @xmath67 than the standard approach which measures average occupation of a single state .",
    "a sample of runs is summarized in table 1 .",
    "exact results for @xmath51 are also quoted .",
    "the last column gives the relative deviation of the current estimate ( col .",
    "5 ) from the exact value .",
    "it should be compared with the estimate of the error based only on the monte carlo data , eq.([err ] ) , given in column 6 .",
    "the estimated error is steadily deacresing like @xmath68 and actual deviation follows the suit albeit with some fluctuations . in all runs",
    "we have made ( about 20 times more than shown in the table ) approximalety 30% of actual deviations were bigger that the mc estimate , as they should .",
    "of course the formula ( [ erth ] ) is essential for planning future monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the errors decrease as a number of trials and not as @xmath69 .",
    "this is because the true random variable in this problem is the number of pairs , i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "in particular the computing effort ( counting pairs ) grows like @xmath70 , and consequently the square root of the computational effort determines decrease of errors as it should .",
    "altogether the monte carlo results are well under contol and show that the method is quite reliable .",
    "it is however practical only if the total number of states is less than several hundred milions .",
    "the last run shown in table 1 lasted few hours on a 200 mhz pc .",
    "this translates into @xmath71 .",
    "we will discuss now if this is sufficient to see the onset of themodynamic properties .",
    "figure 1 shows the entropy density as a function of a scaling variable @xmath54 . statistical errors of mc results ( and the deviation from the exact discrete values given by @xmath51 ) are much smaller that the size of symbols .",
    "the data follow nicely the curves obtained from the classical formula in the continuum , eq.([cont ] ) .",
    "considered as a function of @xmath72 and @xmath39 they obviously show a substantial @xmath39-dependence .",
    "the @xmath39 varies from 8 ( lowest curve ) to 24 in this plot . on the other hand , the deviation from the ultimate scaling limit , ( eq.([thermo ] ) , the uppermost curve ) ,",
    "is around 30% in the worst case ( n=8,m=30 ) . with @xmath39 starting from 12 ,",
    "deviations from the infinite system are smaller than 20% .",
    "note that @xmath39 denotes the nubmer of degrees of freedom , which in @xmath38 space dimensions corresponds to @xmath73 particles .    as a second test",
    "we have checked a differential form of eq.([thermo ] ) @xmath74 which , together with the equipartition of enegry , is the basis of the equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "changing the variable @xmath75 gives @xmath76 or @xmath77 finally after discretization of the derivative we obtain @xmath78 this equation is tested in fig.2 , where a half of the inverse of the left hand side , as obtained from simulations , is ploted as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "solid line represents the right hand side . in this case .",
    "] similarly to the previous case agreement is very good for @xmath79 .",
    "it was neseccary to reduce mc errors to the level of 1%-3% to achieve this agreement .",
    "of couse this test is much more sensitive than the previous one since it requires precise measurement of the derivatives .    to conclude , the coincidence method is satisfactory in practice for the number of degrees of freedom below @xmath80 .",
    "this turns out to be sufficient to see the signatures of the thermal equilibrium . for more than 12 degrees of fredom",
    "the scaling of the entropy density is confirmed with the accuracy better than 20% .",
    "the saddle point relation @xmath81 is also very well reproduced .",
