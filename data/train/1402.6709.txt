    "<S> accurate predictions of heterogeneous dynamics may be made on the basis of a single structural marker while essentially no correlation exists in mean - field like systems such as the gcm . </S>",
    "<S> however , a strong link between _ some _ aspect of static structure and dynamics does exist , as signified by the sizable @xmath30-ratio observed in all the systems we have studied . despite being order agnostic , pts correlations appear to show a connection with specific types of local order such as voronoi signatures in systems whose dynamics may be predicted by the location of such structural motifs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , previous work has detected an apparent connection between the growth of relaxation times and order agnostic length scales in systems where the connection between relaxation times and specific structural metrics is not very strong  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these facts suggest that pts correlations may provide a more general description of the key static fluctuations that determine dynamical behavior in supercooled liquids .    </S>",
