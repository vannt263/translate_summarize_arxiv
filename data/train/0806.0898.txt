    "relativistic plasmas play important roles in high energy phenomena . in nature",
    ", gamma - ray burst afterglow is considered to be a phenomenon resulting from interaction of ultrarelativistic plasmas with a lorentz factor @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "detailed observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena , such as supernova remnants , gamma - ray bursts , and active galactic nuclei , reveal that non - thermal components in their spectrum comprise of radiation from relativistic particles . in recent laser experiments , interaction of laser and plasmas is realized in highly relativistic regime .",
    "these phenomena often involve sufficiently rarefied plasma that the effect of collisions is negligible . in order to give plausible explanations for such phenomena ,",
    "many authors have devoted their energies to investigations into properties of relativistic plasmas , i.e. , instabilities , radiation , and stationary equilibria .    here",
    "i propose a new method to obtain stationary equilibrium configurations of collisionless plasmas described by the relativistic vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "such solutions are of great interest because they give self - consistent configurations of relativistic plasmas , which are used as an initial setup for studies on the relativistic collisionless reconnection of magnetic fields @xcite . in some recent numerical simulations of the relativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection @xcite , relativistic extensions of the harris sheet equilibrium @xcite",
    "are used as the initial setup . while stationary solutions of the non - relativistic vlasov - maxwell system are well explored @xcite , exploration of the relativistic vlasov - maxwell equilibria",
    "is not sufficient .",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite discussed the existence of such solutions and derived a special class of them , studies on the derivation of the concrete expressions of the relativistic vlasov - maxwell equilibria are still rare .    in the previous paper @xcite , a novel method to construct stationary solutions of the non - relativistic vlasov - maxwell system is proposed . in the method ,",
    "the key concept is to describe the deviation of the distribution function from the maxwell - boltzmann by orthogonal polynomial series .",
    "the hermite polynomial series is chosen for the purpose , because the weight function is gaussian , which is equivalent to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "@xcite reveals that this choice is appropriate to recover some well - known equilibria ( the harris sheet and the bennet pinch ) and derive a new equilibrium . in this paper",
    ", i will extend the previous method to deal with relativistic plasmas . instead of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ,",
    "i use a relativistic extension of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , i.e. , the maxwell - jttner distribution @xcite as the weight function of these polynomial series . to the best of my knowledge",
    ", there is no appropriate orthogonal polynomial series that describes the deviation from the maxwell - jttner distribution as the hermite polynomial does for non - relativistic plasmas .",
    "so i introduce two orthogonal polynomials in this paper . applying the method ,",
    "i can derive a new two - dimensional equilibrium , which is a relativistic extension of the equilibrium proposed in the previous paper .",
    "this equilibrium may provide an initial setup for numerical simulations of the relativistic collisionless reconnection .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[form ] , i describe the procedure of the method . in sec.[ex ] , i apply the method to derive a stationary solution that i can treat it analytically .",

    "the relativistic vlasov equation describes the kinetic evolution of the distribution function @xmath1 of particles @xmath2 ( @xmath3 for ions and @xmath4 for electrons ) in the phase space @xmath5 and the maxwell equations describe the evolution of the electromagnetic fields . here",

    "i derive stationary configuration of plasmas uniformly extending in the @xmath8 direction governed by the relativistic vlasov - maxwell system under the assumptions described in the following subsection .",
    "because physical variables do not depend on @xmath9 or @xmath8 , the relativistic vlasov equation is expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the distribution function for particles @xmath2 with the charge @xmath12 and the mass @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the speed of light and @xmath15 is the norm of the momentum . @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the @xmath18-components of electric and magnetic fields , which are functions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "in the following , i describe the procedure to derive solutions of equations ( [ vlasov])-([current ] ) .",

    "the orthogonality relation of @xmath54 ( [ orth_even ] ) , the relation ( [ vanisha ] ) , and the expression ( [ dsodd ] ) yield the following ordinary differential equations , @xmath55 on the other hand , multiplying both sides of equation ( [ integrand ] ) by @xmath56 and integrating with respect to @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , other equations for coefficients @xmath57 are obtained . here",

    "for example , the condition @xmath58 or @xmath59 , reduces equations ( [ releven ] ) and ( [ relodd ] ) to a finite number of ordinary differential equations and enable us to obtain expressions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as functions of @xmath43 .    to derive the source terms in the maxwell equations , substituting equation ( [ fj ] ) into equations ( [ current ] ) and using the orthogonality relations ( [ orth_even ] ) , ( [ orth_odd ] ) , and ( [ vanish ] ) again",

    ", there is a limit in this method . for a stationary equilibrium",
    ", distribution functions can take various forms as long as the pressure balance is achieved .",
    "however , equations ( [ poisson2 ] ) look as if there is a one - to - one correspondence between the field configuration and the distributions @xmath64 and @xmath65 . this disagreement arises from the assumption that the deviation of the distribution function from the maxwell - jttner distribution can be expanded by the polynomial series @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the stationary solutions derived above cover a part of many possible equilibria .",
    "in this section , i consider an application of the stationary solutions derived above to a plasma in a charge neutrality comprising of electrons and ions with the same charge but the opposite sign ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) in which the electric field strength is sufficiently small ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "then , equation ( [ poisson2a ] ) implies that ions and electrons have the same spatial distribution ; @xmath71    as mentioned in the previous section , to solve equations ( [ releven ] ) and ( [ relodd ] ) , i truncate both of the series as @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "that the distribution function of ions @xmath82 takes positive values , the conditions @xmath83 are required .",

    "it is found that this equilibrium is a relativistic extension of the equilibrium proposed in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] illustrates the thus derived configuration of equilibrium . the gray scale and the arrows represent the density distribution @xmath64 of electrons or ions in arbitrary units and the magnetic field , respectively . as in the non - relativistic counterpart @xcite",
    ", we can see that the current filaments lie along the @xmath8-axis and generate the magnetic fields around themselves .",
    "each filament is surrounded by four filaments that carry anti - parallel currents .    here , i focus on the momentum distributions at two points .",
    "one is the center of a filament ( referred to as the o - point ) and the other is a middle point between the filaments carrying parallel currents ( referred to as the x - point ) .",
    "the magnetic field at the x - point is sheared like the harris sheet equilibrium .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows the momentum distributions of ions at the x and o - points .",
    "the values of parameters are as follows ; @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the electron plasma frequency , and @xmath91 . from these values ,",
    "one obtains @xmath92 so i have assumed @xmath93 .",
    "while a symmetric double - peak distribution appears at the x - point due to @xmath94 , an asymmetric one is achieved at the o - point .",
    "in contrast to ions , the momentum distribution of electrons has a symmetric double - peak both at the x and o - points , because the term @xmath95 is much smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "finally , i make a remark on one of the relativistic effects . in comparison with the non - relativistic counterpart",
    ", the distribution tends to have a relatively shallow slope in the high - energy regime , which comes from the difference in the equilibrium distribution .",
    "while the maxwell - boltzmann distribution is proportional to @xmath97 , the maxwell - jttner distribution is proportional to @xmath98 in the limit of @xmath99 . in other words ,",
    "the relativistic one has more high - energy particles than the non - relativistic does .",
    "in this paper , i have developed a novel method to construct stationary solutions of the relativistic vlasov - maxwell system . by applying the method , a new two - dimensional equilibrium , which is a relativistic extension of the previous work @xcite ,",
    "is proposed .",
    "a comparison of the non - relativistic and the relativistic equilibrium is done . as well as the non - relativistic equilibrium , a sheared magnetic field",
    "is generated in the relativistic one .",
    "on the other hand , they show different behaviors in the high - energy regime .",
    "it may provide an initial setup for investigations of the relativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection that takes into account three - dimensional effects .",
    "it will be intriguing to investigate the stability of the equilibrium derived in this paper .",
