    "magnetars are a peculiar subclass of isolated neutron stars @xcite with evidence for ultra - strong magnetic fields , mainly emitting in the x - ray frequency . located along the galactic plane and in the magellanic clouds , @xmath49 soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and @xmath412 anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps )",
    "are currently believed to be of the magnetar class ( for reviews , see ) .",
    "x - ray pulsations have been observed from them in a period range of @xmath9@xmath10  s , indicating slowly rotating isolated pulsars .",
    "together with their large period derivatives @xmath11 s s@xmath8 , the magnetic - dipole - radiation approximation indicates these objects to have ultra - strong magnetic fields of @xmath12 g. thus , it is widely believed that the peculiar characteristics of sgrs and axps originate from their extremely strong magnetic fields .",
    "the x - ray radiation from magnetars emerges on a large variety of time scales and intensities .",
    "one form is  persistent \" x - ray emission with a typical luminosity of @xmath13 erg s@xmath8 , which is usually stable over long periods of time ( @xmath4 a few month or longer ) .",
    "a typical persistent x - ray luminosity of magnetars exceeds by 12 orders of magnitude that available from their rotational energy losses , @xmath14 erg s@xmath8 . without evidence for mass accretion , the emission is therefore considered to be powered by dissipation of the magnetic energies .",
    "the broad - band persistent x - ray spectrum is generally composed of blackbody - like soft x - ray component with a temperature of @xmath40.30.5 kev , and a power - law - like hard x - ray component with a photon index of @xmath15 . while the soft component can be considered as optically - thick thermal radiation from the stellar surface , the hard component , spanning from @xmath410 kev to @xmath4200 kev or higher ,",
    "is considered to emerge through a different and yet unidentified process ( e.g. , ) .",
    "another form of x - ray radiation from magnetars is sporadic emission of bursts with a typical duration from @xmath40.1 seconds to a few hundred seconds .",
    "these bursts are phenomenologically classified into three types : quite rare  giant flares \" with @xmath16 erg s@xmath8 lasting about a few hundred seconds @xcite ,  intermediate flares \" with @xmath17 erg s@xmath8 lasting a few seconds @xcite , and much more frequently occurring  short bursts \" with @xmath18 erg s@xmath8 with @xmath40.1-sec durations @xcite .",
    "thus , these explosive events often show luminosities exceeding the eddington limit for a neutron star of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 being the solar mass ) , @xmath21 erg s@xmath8 , presumably due to suppression of the electron scattering cross sections in the strong field @xcite . the mechanisms of these bursts are thought to be related to rearrangement of the magnetic fields invoking reconnection @xcite , or motion and fracturing of the neutron star crust , i.e. , starquake @xcite .",
    "the persistent x - ray intensity of a magnetar sometimes increases by 12 orders of magnitude with unpredictable timing .",
    "such an transient enhancement lasts typically for a few months , including its gradual decay .",
    "they are often accompanied , at its early phase , by a burst activity , which can even lead to discoveries of new magnetars .",
    "so far , such burst - active states , or outbursts , were observed from some magnetars ; xte  j1810@xmath0197 , cxou  j164710.2@xmath0455216 @xcite , sgr  0501@xmath224516 @xcite , and 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been accumulating reports on such activities from sources with much weaker dipole fields ( @xmath23  g ) ; sgr  0418 + 5729 @xcite , sgr  1833@xmath00832 @xcite , swift  j1822.3@xmath01606 @xcite , and swift  j1834.9@xmath00846 @xcite .",
    "the enhanced persistent emission and the burst activity have been simultaneously observed in many activated magnetars .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how these two emission forms are physically related with each other in the postulated dissipation process of the magnetic energy .",
    "one interesting possibility is that the persistent emission is composed of a large number of small bursts that are not individually detectable ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a possibility has been examined using a cumulative number - intensity distribution of short bursts . however",
    ", the observational information has so far remained insufficient to evaluate this possibility , since the studied short bursts are so bright ( with fluence @xmath24 ergs @xmath2 ) and infrequent that their time - averaged flux is much lower than that of the persistent emission .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to examine , from observations of activated magnetars , whether weaker short bursts become similar in spectral shape to the persistent x - ray emission , as recently found in sgr  0501@xmath224516 @xcite .    in the present paper , we studied the activated magnetar 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 .",

    "several short burst events clearly appeared in all light curves .",
    "the short bursts are characterized as bunched x - ray photons . in order to identify such bunched events",

    "this study utilized the 1070 kev hxd - pin data , since they have a better signal to noise ratio than those of hxd - gso and xis0 , and the finer time - resolution ( 61 @xmath31s ) than xis0 ( @xmath47.8 ms ) .",
    "besides , unlike the xis1 or xis3 data with burst options , hxd - pin is free from periodic data gaps .",
    "the @xmath37 t analysis provides a standard method to identify bunched events , and is actually implemented in the hxd digital electronics ( hxd - de ; section 4.3 of @xcite ) to eliminate instrumental event bunching on time scales of @xmath35 a few ms .        figure  [ fig : delta - time]a shows the calculated @xmath36 distribution of the 1070 kev hxd - pin data with a bin size of @xmath38 ms .",
    "a large portion of these events are non x - ray backgrounds ( nxb ) .",
    "the @xmath36 values of such random events follow an exponential probability distribution , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the average event rate .",
    "the best - fit exponential function , shown therein by a dash - dotted line , gives @xmath32 count s@xmath8 , which agrees well with the average count rate , 0.76 count s@xmath8 , derived in  [ subsection : observation ] . on closer inspection of figure  [ fig : delta - time](a2 ) ,",
    "the actual @xmath36 distribution deviates from the best fit model below @xmath450 ms .",
    "this indicates that some events are bunched , with separations much shorter than @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we choose a threshold interval as @xmath42 ms to regard an event as possibly bunched .",
    "the chance probability of observing @xmath43 is @xmath44=3.6% .    under the above preparation",
    ", we define  an event train of length @xmath45 \" as an event bunching where @xmath45 consecutive events are detected all with a waiting time of @xmath46 .",
    "most nxb events sparsely occur with @xmath47 , and hence , with @xmath45=@xmath48 .",
    "since the chance occurrence of a bunching with length @xmath45 is simply @xmath49 , we estimate those with @xmath503 , 4 , and 5 as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively . considering the 1070 kev total pin events of @xmath54 counts , chance detections of event trains with @xmath503 , 4 , and 5 during the entire observation become @xmath42 , @xmath40.06 , and @xmath40.002 , respectively .",
    "therefore , event trains with @xmath55 would be securely identified as short bursts . compared to a more conventional way of detecting sudden increases in the light curve ,",
    "this method is more suited to our search for weak bursts on two points ; it is unaffected by count binning , and it works even when a burt has rather gradual rise ( e.g. , with a precursor ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta - time]b shows the @xmath45 distribution in comparison with the predicted chance coincidence probability of ordinary events , @xmath49 .",
    "we find data points with @xmath55 which are significantly deviated from the fit , and hence regard them as short bursts .",
    "we further merged two separate bursts into one if they were detected within the adjacent 1 sec . using these criteria",
    ", we successfully detected 18 short burst events as listed in table  [ tab : list of burst ] . to confirm these detections in an independent way",
    ", we also studied distributions of the count rates in the light curves of figure  [ fig : light_curves ] .",
    "the calculated histograms are shown in figure  [ fig : lcdist ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : lcdist](b ) , the short bursts appear as significant deviations from the best - fit poisson distribution , which is superposed as a solid curve .",
    "even only from figure  [ fig : lcdist](b ) , fifteen among the above eighteen bursts were recognized as those 1-sec bins where @xmath348 events were detected .",
    "thus , both methods give almost the same detections .",
    "further corrections for the xis1 timing mode are described in appendix.[subsection : timing correction for the p - sum mode ] .",
    "we also searched the swift / bat data for possible detections of the same short bursts .",
    "using the same trigger code as used in @xcite on the 64 msec bat data , only 2 bursts were recorded by the bat .",
    "this is mainly because the bat , with its wide field of view , has higher background . in other words , hxd - pin onboard _",
    "suzaku _ has a far higher sensitivity to weak short bursts , as long as the source is inside its tightly collimated field of view .",
    "therefore , we utilize the above _ suzaku _ data set for the following analyses .",

    "the bursts are clearly detected by hxd - pin and xis0 , and a considerable fraction of them by hxd - gso as well .",
    "due to the burst option , the coverage of these bursts with xis1 and xis3 ( not shown in figure  [ fig : burst_lc_1 ] ) are highly incomplete .",
    "this however does not hamper our study , because we analyze below the xis0 and hxd data of these bursts .",
    "we exclude burst-6 , presumably the strongest one , since a part of the hxd data was lost due to saturation of the data transfer .",
    "likewise , burst-10 is discarded , because it fell outside the good time interval ( gti ) of the xis .",
    "thus , we hereafter analyze the remaining 16 short bursts .",
    "they are statistically significant with chance probabilities @xmath56 when combining the 1-sec data of xis , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso together ( appendix .",
    "[ subsection : the statistical significances of detected bursts ] ; 1-sec rates are also shown in table  [ tab : list of burst ] ) , and are free from data losses due to dead - time or pile - ups ( appendix [ subsection : estimation of the data loss ] ) .    the burst peaks in table  [ tab : list of burst ] are defined as the time of the maximum count rate of hxd - pin , which have higher signal - to - noise ratios than the others .",
    "as can be seen in figure   [ fig : burst_lc_1 ] , these peaks can be determined with a typical uncertainty of a few bins , or @xmath3550 ms . taking a closer look at individual light curves in figure   [ fig : burst_lc_1 ] ,",
    "some burst photons apparently appear outside the duration of @xmath45 ( table  [ tab : list of burst ] ) defined in ",
    "[ subsection : delta - time distribution ] .",
    "thus , using the xis0 ( 210 kev ) and hxd - pin ( 1070 kev ) data co - added together , we manually defined tentative burst durations to cover whole possible burst x - ray photons . within the above durations , we further calculated the time period , @xmath57 , starting when 5% of the xis0+pin photons has been detected and ending when 95% has been observed .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : t90 ] ( and also table  [ tab : list of burst ] ) , the @xmath57 values range from @xmath447 ms to 1.9 s , with the average of 321 ms .",
    "this value is close to the mean values derived in recent works of the same object , @xmath58258 ms @xcite and 305 ms @xcite , where the disagreement may have arisen because these works utilized different sets of short bursts , with different fluences and different energy ranges .",

    "in contrast to the successful cutpl model , the more convex 2bb model , which was successful on the brightest three bursts (  [ subsection : characteristics of detected bursts ] ) , became much less successful ( @xmath87 ; figure  [ fig : accumulated]e ) .",

    "in fact , the value of @xmath88 , obtained above by the pl fit with free @xmath66 , is consistent with @xmath89 of the persistent hard component ( table  [ tab : list of spectral fittings of cummulative ] ) .",
    "although the cutpl model gave a much harder photon index , @xmath90 , the slope is still similar , if considering the effect of cutoff around @xmath463 kev .    in order to more directly compare these @xmath73 spectra , we divided the stacked weak - burst spectrum by that of the persistent emission .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : compare_color]b , the resultant ratios stay constant at @xmath4170 over the @xmath48200 kev energy range . the remaining difference in the ratio below @xmath48 kev in figure  [ fig :",

    "we hence re - calculated the same ratio in figure  [ fig : compare_color]c after eliminating the soft bb component from the persistent spectrum .",
    "thus , the ratio became much flatter even in energies below @xmath410 kev , suggesting that the weak - burst spectrum is similar in shape to the hard x - ray component in the persistent emission .",
    "finally , in order to examine our weak - burst sample for its homogeneity , we subdivided the 13 bursts rather randomly into two subsets , under a constraint that they should be comparable , to within 10% in the summed signal photon counts ( xis0 , pin , gso summed ) .",

    "especially the good similarity above @xmath48 kev points to possible presence of the hard pl component in the stacked weak - burst spectrum , like in the persistent emission spectra .",
    "the short bursts from the transient magnetar sgr  0501 + 4516 were already examined for such a possibility with an affirmative answer @xcite .    in order to assess the above consideration , we re - analyzed the stacked weak - burst spectrum , by adding , to the 2bb model , a hard pl with its slope fixed at @xmath91 as specified by the persistent emission ( paper i ) .",
    "the inclusion of the hard pl has made the 2bb fit acceptable , as summarized in figure  [ fig : accumulated]f and table  [ tab : list of spectral fittings of cummulative ] .",
    "the additional pl contributes to the total 1300 kev flux by 52% , and is statistically significant , because the achieved fit improvement , @xmath92 , implies an f - test chance probability of of @xmath93 .",
    "even though an acceptable fit with a comparable goodness had already been obtained with the cutpl model , we consider the 2bb+pl modeling more appropriate , for the following two reasons .",

    "this is because the distinction between the brighter and fainter bursts in the present observation is purely technical , without particular reason to consider that the two groups have distinct nature .",
    "then , to the 2bb model describing the 3 bright bursts , we added the hard pl with @xmath95 fixed at the same value .",
    "this improved the fit to burst-7 , 14 , and 16 , by @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , giving f - test probabilities of 0.60% , 7.4% , and 2.4% , respectively .",
    "thus , the hard pl component is likely to contribute at least to burst-7 .",
    "the best fit spectra are shown in figure  [ fig:2bb_pl.eps ] in @xmath73 forms , with the derived parameters in tabel  [ tab : list of spectral fittings ] .",
    "the bb temperatures did not change within errors from those obtained in the previous pure 2bb modeling (  [ subsection : characteristics of detected bursts ] ) , while the hard pl component was found to contribute to the total 1300 kev fluxes of burst-7 , 14 , and 16 , by 10% , 14% , and 19% respectively .",
    "during the 33.5 ks of effective exposure with the hxd onto 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 in its 2009 january activity , we detected 18 short bursts with their fluence @xmath99 above @xmath100 erg @xmath2 , and analyzed 16 of them .",
    "even the strongest three among the 16 bursts , with the 1070 kev fluence of @xmath101@xmath102 erg @xmath2 ( or @xmath103 erg @xmath2 in 1300 kev ) , are still weaker than most of previously reported bursts from magnetars in general which typically have @xmath104 erg @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the burst forest of 1e  1547.0 - 5408 observed on 2009 january 22 with _ swift _ , _ integral _ , _ suzaku _ , and _ fermi _ was composed of events with @xmath105 erg s@xmath8 up to @xmath106 erg @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present _ suzaku _ results , together with those by @xcite on sgr  0501 + 4516 , provide valuable information on the wide - band spectra of weak short bursts . for reference",
    ", the present sample defines a burst frequency of @xmath107 burst s@xmath8 in the range of @xmath108 .",
    "so far , wide - band spectra of many energetic ( @xmath109 erg s@xmath8 ) short bursts from magnetars have been explained successfully by the 2bb model : these include numerous bursts from sgr  1806@xmath020 and sgr  1900@xmath2214 @xcite , as well as the strongest _ suzaku _ burst from sgr  0501 + 4516 @xcite . at the same time , the 2bb model can generally reproduce the soft x - ray component , which is ubiquitously seen at energies of @xmath110 kev of wide - band persistent spectra from magnetars including 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 itself ( paper i ) .",
    "these 2bb fits to the two different forms of magnetar emission reveal an interesting common scaling as @xmath111 @xcite , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 denote the lower and higher 2bb temperatures , respectively .",
    "these results reinforce the possibility that the persistent emission is composed of numerous micro short bursts (  [ introduction ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the 2bb modeling is thus considered to have some physical meanings beyond a mere convention , below we construct our discussion based on the 2bb modeling , rather than those with the cutpl model which is rather empirical .",
    "the three brightest bursts in our present sample , particularly the brighter two ( burst 7 and 16 ) , among our sample exhibit upward convex spectral shapes , which have been successfully described by the 2bb model over an extremely wide energy band of @xmath114 to @xmath115 kev (  [ subsection : characteristics of detected bursts ] ) .",
    "importantly , the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 derived from these bursts ( possibly except for burst-14 ) obey the above scaling relation .",
    "in contrast , the stacked weaker bursts have a less convex shape ( figure [ fig : compare_color ] ) , and did not accept the simple 2bb modeling .",
    "this is understandable if we presume that the spectra of weaker bursts are contributed by the hard component with a power - law photon index @xmath15 , which is generally observed in the persistent emission of magnetars @xcite .",
    "the weak bursts from sgr  0501 + 4516 , when stacked together , actually exhibited a hard - tail feature @xcite .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : compare_color ] b and c provide supporting evidence for this possibility , where the ratios become flatter above @xmath48 kev .",
    "we have accordingly added a hard pl component to the 2bb model in  [ subsection : possible thermal / non - thermal model ] , fixing @xmath85 at the same value as obtained from the persistent emission , and obtained a fully acceptable spectral fit .",
    "thus , the hard component is significantly present in the stacked weak - burst spectrum , as long as the 2bb model is chosen as the start point of analysis . as a further justification of this 2bb+pl modeling , the stacked spectrum yield @xmath116 ( from table  [ tab : list of spectral fittings of cummulative ] ) in agreement with the",
    " canonical \" ratio , with it was @xmath117 before properly including the pl component . as argued by @xcite , these strengthen the similarity between the burst and persistent emissions .",
    "the report by @xcite , that weaker bursts tend to show harder spectra in terms of the 2bb analysis , may be understood if considering possible contributions of the same pl component to their weaker bursts .",
    "the above results have lead us to a natural question about brighter short bursts , of which the spectra generally lack the pl component : is this an intrinsic effect due , e.g. , to some changes in the emission mechanism , or an artifact caused by their higher 2bb temperatures which mask any pl emission ? with this in mind , we examined (  [ subsection : possible thermal / non - thermal model ] ) the spectra of the three brighter _ suzaku _ bursts , for possible contribution from such a hard component .",
    "then , the presence of the pl component ( on top of the 2bb model ) was suggested in burst-7 at a relatively high confidence ( @xmath11897% ) level .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig : thermal_vs_nonthermal.eps ] on the thermal ( 2bb ) vs non - thermal ( pl ) luminosity plane , in comparison with the weak - burst and persistent spectra . there , assuming a source distance of 4 kpc @xcite , the persistent x - ray emission ( paper i ) is represented by a bolometric blackbody luminosity of @xmath119 erg s@xmath8 and absorption - corrected 1300 kev pl luminosity of @xmath120 erg s@xmath8 , which sum up to give the total luminosity of @xmath121 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "we also quote the results on sgr  0501 + 4516 , taken from @xcite . although it is still difficult at present to distinguish the two alternatives the pl luminosity , if it is universally present in short bursts , appears to saturate at @xmath122 erg s@xmath8 , preferring the former possibility",
    ".    on large scales , figure  [ fig : thermal_vs_nonthermal.eps ] reveals a clear positive correlation between luminosities of the two emission components .",
    "therefore , the soft ( thermal ) and hard ( pl ) components are considered to approximately keep their luminosity ratio over a very broad scale in flux or fluence .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that the luminosity ratio between these two emission components , comprising the persistent emission , is not much different between magnetars in activity and those in quiescence .",
    "these facts give another support to the microburst conjecture .      in order to examine the possibility that the persistent x - ray emission is composed of micro burst events , it is inevitable to evaluate x - ray fluxes accumulated over resolved and unresolved bursts events . since the present short bursts , with @xmath123 erg @xmath2 ,",
    "were detected at a low burst frequency , @xmath124 s@xmath8 , their accumulated flux is still at a level of @xmath125 erg s@xmath8 @xmath2 .",
    "this is by @xmath42 orders of magnitude lower than the observed persistent x - ray flux .",
    "therefore , much larger contributions of smaller unresolved short bursts are required to explain the persistent x - ray flux .    for a quantitative estimate ,",
    "let @xmath126 denote the occurrence frequency of those bursts of which the fluence is @xmath127 .",
    "observationally , @xmath128 is thought to be described by a single power - law as @xmath129@xmath130 , like in solar flares and earthquakes . sometimes known as the gutenberg - richter law",

    "thus , the luminosity integrated over bursts between @xmath146 and @xmath147 , at a distance @xmath148 ( kpc ) , is given as @xmath149 with @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 . here , let us assume @xmath153 erg @xmath2 ( the present detection limit ) , and @xmath154 , at @xmath1554 kpc .",
    "the observed frequency @xmath156 burst s@xmath8 gives @xmath157 burst s@xmath8 . in order to explain the persistent luminosity in this way , we clearly need @xmath158 , because @xmath159 should increase towards smaller values of @xmath99 .",
    "more quantitatively , figure  [ fig : luminosity_alpha_gl.eps ] shows the calculated value of @xmath160 as a function of @xmath161 for these different values of @xmath162 .    comparing the three brightest bursts and the stacked weaker ones in table  [ tab : list of spectral fittings ] and table  [ tab : list of spectral fittings of cummulative ] , the blackbody radii of neither the lower- or higher - temperature components are strongly dependent on their fluences @xmath99 .",
    "thus , as a first - order approximation , let us assume @xmath163 after the stefan - boltzmann law . since the weak bursts with @xmath164 and persistent emission give @xmath165 kev and @xmath166 kev , respectively , a typical unresolved weakest burst is considered to have a fluence @xmath167 .",
    "combining with figure  [ fig : luminosity_alpha_gl.eps ] , this implies that the slope @xmath161 should be @xmath41.2 and @xmath41.4 to supply the luminosity of the persistent bb and pl luminosities , respectively .",
    "the required value of @xmath1681.4 is larger than has been measured . since the observations of bursts were performed mainly during more burst - active states than in the _ suzaku _ observation , a possible interpretation is variations of @xmath161 depending on the magnetar activity .",
    "for example , the solar flare is known to change its size - distribution slope @xmath161 , from @xmath40.8 at activity peaks to @xmath41.2 in more quiescent states @xcite .",
    "this is also pointed out in some magnetars ( see also sgr  1806@xmath020 and sgr  1900 + 14 in @xcite , related with sgr  0501 + 4516 behavior in @xcite ) . if @xmath161 reaches 1.21.4 in less burst - active states , the persistent emission can be explained by the superposition of micro bursts .",
    "otherwise , an alternative dissipation process that is independent of the short - burst production is inferred to be also contributing to the persistent emission .",
    "such processes include , e.g. , internal crustal heating in magnetars @xcite .",
    "finally , let us compare energetics of the bursts and persistent emission with the magnetic energies of magnetars . assuming 4 kpc as before , the 2bb model and the stefan - boltzmann law measure the total radiated energies of @xmath169 erg , @xmath170 erg , and @xmath170 erg , from burst-7 , burst-14 , and burst-16 , respectively . further considering the @xmath57 values ,",
    "these yield bolometric luminosities of @xmath171 erg s@xmath8 , @xmath172 erg s@xmath8 , and @xmath173 erg s@xmath8 , respectively . in the weaker bursts ,",
    "an average energy emitted per bust becomes @xmath174 erg , and the bolometric luminosity is @xmath175 erg s@xmath8 .    in comparison with the above estimates , the magnetic energy stored within a size of @xmath176 becomes @xmath177 when normalizing to the dipole magnetic field , @xmath178 g @xcite , and employing the canonical neutron start radius @xmath179 km . if the individual burst emission is powered by dissipation of the magnetic energy in this region ( e.g. , via reconnection ; @xcite ) , a typical size of @xmath180 is needed .",
    "blackbody radii observed in our sample ( the 2bb model ) , @xmath181@xmath41 km = @xmath182 and @xmath183@xmath40.1 km = @xmath184 , are larger than the required @xmath176 .",

    "here we describe further calibrations of the time assignments and responses of the p - sum ( timing ) mode xis0 , dedicated towards the present analyses .",
    "it is known that there is still a slight time lag ( @xmath430 ms ) assigned to the p - sum mode of the xis , even after including corrections related with read - out time delays , depending on the source position on the xis ccd chip ( see @xcite ) . to study the burst light curves in detail",
    ", we further assigned an additional timing correction to the p - sum mode , comparing the hxd - pin data , which was already accurately calibrated using the crab pulsar @xcite . in order to evaluate the residual time lag , we compared the burst light curves of the xis0 to that of hxd - pin both in the 1014 kev .",
    "we accumulated 5 short bursts in which the 1014 kev photons were clearly detected in the hxd - pin data .",
    "panels in figure  [ fig : accumulated_light_curve ] ( left ) are the 1014 kev cumulative light curves of xis0 and hxd - pin , respectively , while panels in figure  [ fig : accumulated_light_curve ] ( right ) are the 4070 kev ones of hxd - pin and hxd - gso as a reference .",
    "as compared here , the 4070 kev peaks correspond with each other , while a peak of the 1014 kev xis0 data comes slightly later than that of the hxd - pin .    in order to quantitatively evaluate this xis0 time lag",
    ", we calculated cross - correlations of them .",
    "the cross - correlation coefficience @xmath198 for the @xmath199-th bin is calculated by @xmath200 figure  [ fig : cross_corr](a ) and ( b ) show cross - correlation coefficients of the 1014 kev and 4070 kev data , respectively . as clearly shown in these figures ,",
    "no time lag was confirmed between the hxd 4070 kev data ( figure  [ fig : cross_corr]b ) , while the cross - correlation peak of the 1014 kev range appears at 31.25 ms in figure  [ fig : cross_corr](a ) .",
    "thus , we assigned the time correction of 31.25 ms to the xis0 data set ( ` time`@xmath00.0325 s ) .",
    "this correction is consistent with the previous analyses of the persistent x - ray emission at  3.1 in paper i. individual light curves of xis0 in figure  [ fig : burst_lc_1 ] were already corrected on this time lag of the 31.25 ms .      for the xis0 spectral analyses , we produced rmf and arf files based on the procedure stated in @xcite .",
    "since the p - sum spectral data is not widely utilized so far , it requires a careful calibration , we further included correction factors to rmf and arf fiels , as follows . the persistent x - ray emission from 1e",
    "1547.0@xmath05408 was already measured using the xis1 , xis3 , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso data in paper i. we also produced the same persistent x - ray spectra from the xis0 , after eliminating bright short bursts , and compared it with that in paper i. we fixed the spectral parameters at the values reported in paper i , and only three parameters of the xis0 response ( a normalization factor , a slope and an offset of the gain ) were left free to be fitted .",
    "then , we determined the normalization factor , the slope and the gain to be 1.079 , 0.90 , @xmath201 , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we use these correction factors .",
    "we have already evaluated the detection significances in  2.2 using only the hxd - pin data . here",
    "we further evaluated the statistical significance of these detections combing the xis , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso together .",
    "especially , the xis instruments are placed at different location in the _ suzaku _ satellite , temporal coincidences of the x - ray events between the hxd and the xis0 make the detection much plausible . a possibility to detect @xmath202 events , from the poisson distribution of its average @xmath40 count sec@xmath8 , during a time duration of @xmath203",
    "can be written as @xmath204 .",
    "thus , multiplied by the independent instruments , the total probability of these bursts become @xmath205 . here",
    "we employ @xmath206 sec and corresponding burst rates listed in table  [ tab : list of burst ] , together with average rate of @xmath207 counts s@xmath8 , @xmath208 counts s@xmath8 , @xmath209 counts s@xmath8 ( see  2.1 ) . considering the total bin number of @xmath210 , chance occurrence @xmath211 of these bursts",
    "are estimated to be below @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , we confirmed these events are indeed short bursts .",
    "the burst data ( except for burst-6 and burst-10 ) , were examined for possible losses or pile - ups , through the same procedure as applied to the much brighter burst from sgr  0501 + 4516 recorded with _ suzaku _ in 2008 @xcite .",
    "there are three possible forms of the data loss ; ( 1 ) dead time in the event handling at the analog electronics ( hxd - ae ) , ( 2 ) the limited event transfer rate from hxd - ae to the digital electronics ( hxd - de ) , and ( 3 ) that from hxd - de to the spacecraft data processor .",
    "since the peak count rates of these bursts are less than @xmath460 counts ( 15.6 ms)@xmath8 , the effect of ( 1 ) is estimated to be at most @xmath358% . and",
    "on average @xmath41% , since the data acquisition time ( 20 @xmath31s ) is much shorter than the burst event interval .",
    "pileup is much less effective due to a short time window for the pulse height latch .",
    "these event data were not lost in the above ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) processes as well , since the event rates were much smaller than the maximum limits ; 4 khz for ( 2 ) and 400 counts ( 4 sec)@xmath8 for ( 3 ) .",
    "thus , our samples are free from the data loss due to the dead - time or the event pile - ups .",
    "since the dead - time effect is typically @xmath212% for most cases , we does not correct the dead - time ."
