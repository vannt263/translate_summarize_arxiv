    "the finite element method ( fem ) is a common tool in the engineering and scientific community to simulate physical problems , and @xcite describe the method in depth .",
    "the fem was first developed for structural problems , but later also adapted for heat and fluid problems @xcite , and now it is applicable for many physical problems such as electromagnetism @xcite . in the fem the unknown quantities of a problem are approximated by polynomial expansions defined in elements of the computational domain .",
    "the fem is based on the differential version of the governing equations , which is defined in _",
    "points _ , however , the derivation of these equations is based on geometrical observations and these are not represented in the differential equations . in structural problems",
    "the consequence is that the governing differential equations of force equilibrium are not satisfied within an element and across inter - element boundaries pointwise @xcite .",
    "newton s third law , which states that an action should have an equal and opposite reaction , is therefore violated at such interfaces .",
    "the equations describing structural problems and its variables are very geometrical @xcite , and a more physically correct approach would be to consider the geometric aspects of the problem , and expand variables associated to geometrical structures such as lines , surfaces and volumes .",
    "this will have the following advantages over the traditional fem :    * the force equilibrium is satisfied locally . *",
    "the method is geometrically robust ; it does not break down on highly deformed meshes .    in traditional fem",
    "the stresses are calculated based on the nodal displacement and the best approximation of the stresses are at the gauss points .",
    "this means that stresses must be extrapolated to boundaries of the element giving a discontinuous stress field across the elements . to make it continuous the values are often averaged , but this can give erroneous results if , for instance , the elements have different material parameters .",
    "the approach in this paper expands the stresses based on the forces on the surfaces of the element , and therefore produces continuous stress fields over the element boundaries .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that conservation laws can be exactly represented at the discrete level , while the numerical approximation occurs in the constitutive equations .",
    "these references consider scalar conservation equations like conservation of mass . in this paper",
    "we extend these ideas to vector - valued conservation laws , such as conservation of force equilibrium in continuum mechanics .",
    "the method is based on the _ mimetic spectral element method _ presented in @xcite , where the variables of the problem are considered as real valued differential @xmath0-forms , which we associate to geometrical objects of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the geometry of elastic problems in the discrete setting has been considered in @xcite , where the elasticity complex was defined . in the work of yavari , @xcite",
    ", the variables of an elastic problem are represented as _ vector- and covector - valued - differential @xmath0-forms _ , which means that the variables are associated to geometrical objects of dimension @xmath0 , which maps into linear vector spaces . in yavari s",
    "work the constitutive relations expressed in vector - valued exterior calculus are more complicated than the real - valued cases .",
    "for further developments of yavari s work see @xcite , where the last reference discusses the elastic complex in detail . in the traditional structural fem",
    "there is also a coupling to the geometry , as shown by reddy and srinivasa @xcite , where it was derived that the edges of the elements act like trusses .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : gov_equations ] the governing equations of a linear elastic problem are given .",
    "in section [ sec : geometry ] the geometry of the governing equations is considered and discrete exact versions of the gradient- and divergence - operator are provided .",
    "the governing equations based on these geometrical observations are presented in section [ sec : the_equations ] . in section [ sec : pww ] the principle of virtual displacements is applied to the equations .",
    "the spectral expansion polynomials are presented in section [ sec : basis_functions ] , where also the finite dimensional variational formulation is given .",
    "two test cases are presented in section [ sec : results ] , while concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the governing equations for a structural problem in @xmath1 are given by the equations of force equilibrium , the strain - displacement relations , and the stress - strain relations , where the latter comprise the constitutive equations .",
    "the equations of force equilibrium are given by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a vector of the components of the second order cauchy stress tensor and @xmath4 is a vector of the body force densities , and @xmath5 denotes a matrix differential operators with @xmath6 denoting the transpose . in a cartesian coordinate system",
    "we have @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the strain displacement relations are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 contain the components of the second order strain tensor listed in a vector , @xmath11 is the displacement vector and @xmath12 is the gradient matrix , which is the transpose of divergence matrix in , and @xmath13 the constitutive equations can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16 matrix of elasticity constants .    for elastic materials the entries of @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of a reduced number of material parameters , elastic moduli and poisson s ratios or lam constants , depending on the material under consideration . the constitutive relation can also be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the compliance matrix .",
    "equations , and form the starting point of structural finite element expansions @xcite . through the principle of virtual work a variational problem is formulated , the computational domain is divided in a number of elements and the displacement field in each element is expanded typically in lagrange polynomials .",
    "the result is a linear system of algebraic equations among the nodal ( and possibly nodless ) displacements : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a column vector containing all expansion coefficients for the displacement field , @xmath21 contains the expansion coefficients for the force field and @xmath22 is called the _ stiffness matrix_.    in this conventional formulation , the governing equations are only satisfied in an integral sense , and locally the equations are only approximately satisfied . for instance , the derivatives in @xmath12 are calculated by differentiating the lagrange polynomials , which , if @xmath23 approximations are used in the displacement field , results in discontinuous strain fields between elements and therefore discontinuous stress fields across element boundaries .",
    "this is physically not correct since it violates newton s third law that an action should have an equal and opposite reaction .",
    "the stress tensor is defined as the surface force per unit area in the limit for vanishing area @xcite .",
    "a more physically correct approach would be to treat each element as a free body having forces acting on its boundaries and a body force in the interior .",
    "using surface forces as our degrees of freedom instead of nodal forces and expanding the body forces as volumetric forces will ensure that force equilibrium is satisfied locally .",
    "the step where we go from an integral model to a differential model is when we take the limits by letting the size of the element approach zero , and thereby obtain the differential versions of the gradient and divergence operators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , these operators ( and the curl operator as well , which is not used in this work ) are derived based on finite - sized geometrical objects .",
    "therefore , it is possible to evaluate these operators _ exactly _ in a finite setting , which is the scope of this section .    starting with the gradient operator ,",
    "consider the function @xmath24 .",
    "the gradient with respect to the coordinate axes @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the point @xmath28 describes the local rate of change of scalar function @xmath29 along the coordinate axes at @xmath28 @xmath30 taking this back to a finite setting implies integrating between two point , say @xmath31 and @xmath32 , along a curve @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , then by the gradient theorem of calculus @xcite @xmath35 the integral of the gradient of a scalar function , @xmath36 , is just the difference between the value of @xmath36 at the end points of the curve .",
    "the divergence of a vector field @xmath37 in @xmath1 in a point @xmath28 is given by @xmath38 integrating the divergence over a volume , @xmath39 , takes it to a finite setting through the divergence theorem @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the area given by the boundary of @xmath39 projected to the plane , which the @xmath42 component of the boundary unit normal vector is normal to .",
    "the sign of the integral is positive when the component of the unit normal vector is in the same direction as the @xmath43-axis and negative when it is opposite .",
    "e.g. @xmath44 will be the boundary projected to the plane spanned by the @xmath26 and @xmath27 axes .",
    "the divergence operator is seen to be just the sum of all fluxes over the boundary of @xmath39 and can easily be calculated .",
    "for instance consider a rectangular domain in a cartesian coordinate system placed as shown in figure [ fig : fluxes_nice ] and let @xmath45 be the fluxes across the boundaries as shown in figure [ fig : fluxes_nice ] , where @xmath46 indicates that this differential is missing , then @xmath47 which is exact",
    ".        in curvilinear coordinates on complex domains the gradient and divergence can still be easily evaluated .",
    "one maps a simple domain , e.g. a square cube in the reference @xmath48-frame to the deformed domain in the @xmath49-frame .",
    "let the coordinates @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 be functions of the reference coordinates @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , hence mapping @xmath53 , then @xmath54 so the integral of the gradient in is the same .",
    "the integral of the divergence is also independent of the coordinate system , which is illustrated in figure [ fig : fluxes_mapping ] , where a square cube , @xmath55 , in the reference frame is mapped to the deformed domain @xmath39 in @xmath49-frame .",
    "described in the reference frame @xmath48 is mapped to the domain @xmath39 in frame @xmath49 .",
    "the fluxes @xmath56 across the boundaries are independent of the frame.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    performing a change of variables on gives @xmath57 which can be rearranged to read @xmath58 where @xmath59 the minus sign comes from the fact that a surface spanned by the unit vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the @xmath62- and @xmath63-directions , respectively , has the unit surface normal vector @xmath64 .",
    "equation can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 the fluxes are , however , invariant of the frame and the divergence of the example in figure [ fig : fluxes_mapping ] is @xmath67",
    "the governing equations of a structural problem in @xmath1 presented in section [ sec : gov_equations ] are now put in an integral context by applying the constructions presented in section [ sec : geometry ] .",

    "denotes an index in the physical domain with coordinates @xmath49 and @xmath70 an index in the reference domain with coordinates @xmath48 .",
    "the integration of a stress component @xmath71 over a surface , @xmath72 , produces a surface force component , @xmath73 , on the surface in direction @xmath43 @xmath74 by comparing this with and then it is evident that the integral of the divergence of the stress tensor over an element is given by @xmath75 to account for deformed elements a mapping from the simple domain with coordinates @xmath48 to the physical domain with coordinates @xmath49 is required .",
    "the cauchy stress tensor must be transformed to the simple domain @xmath76 , where @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 denotes the @xmath48-coordinates and the @xmath69 denotes the @xmath49-coordinates .",
    "thus , @xmath79 denotes the first piola  kirchhoff stress tensor ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if the second index also was transformed then the change of direction of the surface forces should also be accounted for .",
    "put differently , if both indices of the stress tensor are transformed then after integrating over a surface the resulting force component would be normal or tangential to the surface , and a transformation is required to align it with the @xmath49-coordinates .",
    "the approach of using the first piola - kirchhoff stresses was also considered in @xcite .    following the approach from to the surface force component @xmath80 , which is",
    "the result of integrating @xmath81 over the surface @xmath82 , @xmath83 a body force component , @xmath84 , is acting on the volume of an element , and a displacement component , @xmath85 , is specified in a point inside the domain as shown on figure [ fig : forces_displacements ] .    .",
