    "( similar statements can be made for semistable bundles . )    for line bundles , brill - noether theory has been studied since the last century , and for a generic curve the basic questions have been answered ( see @xcite ) . however , the corresponding theory for vector bundles of higher rank is far from being complete even for the generic case .",
    "( in section 2 we will recall the known results for this case . )    in this paper we will be concerned with the nonemptiness question .",
    "we will prove ( see corollary 3.2 and theorem 3.9 ) that    _ if @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 then , _ for any _ @xmath0 , @xmath20 _ more generally ,    _ if @xmath5 and there exists a line bundle @xmath21 on @xmath0 of degree @xmath22 with @xmath23 , then @xmath24 _    observe that such a line bundle @xmath21 always exists if @xmath25 .",

    "the results , in this case , come close to a complete solution of the nonemptiness problem . in particular , the boundary of the region in which stable bundles of rank @xmath39 can exist is completely determined , and , as might be expected ,",
    "it is close to the clifford line .    on the other hand , the results in @xcite , later refined in @xcite ,",

    "we describe the region @xmath38 in the @xmath10-plane for the general case . in section 5 we compare the regions @xmath38 and @xmath40 . in section 6 we study the case where @xmath0 is hyperelliptic .",
    "in this section we recall the known results of brill - noether theory for vector bundles of higher rank ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , and thereby also fix notations",
    ". we will use the brill - noether map to indicate the regions where not only the nonemptiness is known but also some of the topology of @xmath28 .",

    "we define the brill - noether loci for @xmath27 , @xmath42 as in the introduction . denoting by @xmath43 the moduli space of equivalence classes of semistable bundles over @xmath0 of rank @xmath12 and degree @xmath13",

    "if it is @xmath12-bn for all @xmath12 such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both integers we just say it is a bn point .    in the brill - noether map , using the riemann - roch theorem and clifford s theorem , one can define a region such that outside this region the problem becomes trivial , in the sense that @xmath28 is either empty or the whole moduli space @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , consider the following lines :    _ i _ ) @xmath57   ( riemann - roch line )    _ ii _ ) @xmath58  ( clifford line )    these lines , together with the positive axes and the line @xmath59 , define a bounded pentagonal region , which we denote by @xmath60 .",

    ", riemann - roch implies that @xmath28 is the whole space . above and to the left of @xmath60 , riemann - roch and clifford s theorem , together with the definition of stability , imply that @xmath28 is empty .",

    "i ) _ for @xmath62 , the only stable bundle in @xmath60 is the trivial line bundle @xmath63 at the point @xmath64 , while for @xmath59 , the only such bundle is the canonical line bundle @xmath65 at the point @xmath66 .",
    "however semistable bundles exist at all points of these two edges of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "note that , according to our definition , the points @xmath64 and @xmath66 are only @xmath67-bn .",
    "_ ii ) _ the inequalities defining @xmath60 are all sharp except for the clifford bound .",
    "the exact rle of this bound is not clear but it has , for example , been improved by re ( see @xcite ) for non - hyperelliptic curves . in this case , if we restrict to the range @xmath68 , we can replace the clifford line by the line @xmath69 .",
    "for further improvements , see for example @xcite and @xcite .    by serre duality",
    "we know that , if @xmath10 is bn , then so is @xmath70 though it is not readily apparent from figure 1 , this gives a symmetry in @xmath60 through the line @xmath71 . for later purposes , it will be convenient to write @xmath72 so that in particular @xmath73 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "an important feature of the bn map is the curve defined by the equation @xmath74 called the _ brill - noether curve _ ( or bn curve ) . from what was said earlier",
    ", this represents the boundary of the region where one would expect the brill - noether loci to have positive dimension , though it is known that this analogy to the case of line bundles is not valid in general ( see @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "the bn curve is a portion of a hyperbola , with equation @xmath75    the results of @xcite and @xcite allow us to define a polygonal region which we denote by @xmath40 , contained in the interesting region @xmath60 in the @xmath10-plane , such that any point @xmath10 in @xmath40 is bn except possibly for certain vertices .",
    "this region was described in detail in @xcite and @xcite in its original form , and we will recall its construction in section 4 incorporating the results of @xcite . for the time being , we just point out that @xmath40 has sides parallel to the lines @xmath76 , and vertices at points with integer coordinates , on or below the bn curve ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the most significant results for our purposes are the following , which hold for slopes restricted to @xmath77 :    1 .   for @xmath78 , brambila - paz , grzegorczyk and newstead proved in @xcite that @xmath10 is bn if and only if @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath81 ,",
    "mercat in @xcite proved that @xmath10 is bn if and only if @xmath82 .    in the bn map",
    "these results define two trapezoidal regions inside @xmath83 , which we will denote by @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "ballico , mercat and newstead have recently proved the existence of stable bundles at some points outside the regions defined above ; in particular , these bundles can have negative brill - noether number @xcite .    for @xmath0 generic",
    ", teixidor also proved that @xmath28 has an irreducible component of dimension @xmath86 . for any curve",
    ", brambila - paz , grzegorczyk and newstead in @xcite also proved that for @xmath87 , if @xmath28 is nonempty , then it is irreducible of dimension @xmath86 , and @xmath88 ( @xcite , theorem a ) . for @xmath89 ,",
    "mercat in @xcite also proved that , if @xmath90 or @xmath91 , @xmath92 is irreducible ( @xcite , 2-b-1 and 3-a-1 ) ; in any case all components have the expected dimension and @xmath88 ( @xcite , 2-c-1 ) .",
    "so , for slopes @xmath93 , the results are very complete .",
    "for @xmath94 , sundaram @xcite proved that @xmath95 is irreducible of dimension @xmath96 , and laumon @xcite showed @xmath97= @xmath98 . for rank @xmath99",

    "for further details , see remark 4.8 .",
    "> from the results of @xcite and the symmetry of the region @xmath60 , for @xmath102 one has a complete description of brill - noether loci : nonemptiness , irreducibility and singularities .",
    "in this section we will prove assertions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note first that , for any line bundle @xmath21 of degree @xmath22 , the formula @xmath103 defines an isomorphism @xmath104    we shall make repeated use of this idea of tensoring stable bundles by line bundles . if @xmath105 is a subvariety of @xmath11 , then @xmath106 is a subvariety of @xmath107 ; in particular , if @xmath105 is a non - empty brill - noether locus and @xmath108 , then @xmath106 will meet certain brill - noether loci in @xmath109 , which will therefore be non - empty .",
    "actually , if @xmath110 then there always exists a line bundle @xmath21 of degree @xmath22 that has at least one section , so we have the following theorem .    if @xmath111 ( respectively @xmath112 ) , then @xmath113 ( respectively @xmath114 ) for any @xmath115 .    _",

    "proof : _ take @xmath123 and @xmath124 in corollary 3.2 .    in general ,",
    "the multiplication map @xmath125 is not injective and @xmath126 does not give a lower bound for @xmath127 .",
    "however , if @xmath117 is a point in @xmath28 with @xmath128 and @xmath21 a line bundle of degree @xmath129 with at least @xmath130 independent sections , then we have the following lemmas .    if @xmath131 , then @xmath132    _ proof : _ from @xcite ( for @xmath133 ) and @xcite , 3-a-1 ( for @xmath91 ) we know that any such bundle has @xmath134 as a subsheaf",

    "we finish this section by describing the above results for @xmath182 .",
    "suppose @xmath0 has genus @xmath100 .",
    "it follows from @xcite , @xcite and corollary 3.3 that a point @xmath183 is bn if @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , except possibly when @xmath101 and @xmath187 .",

    "in this section , using the results of the previous section , combined with serre duality , we describe the region @xmath38 . throughout the section",
    "@xmath0 is an arbitrary non - singular algebraic curve of genus @xmath196 .    in order to translate the results of section 2 into geometric form ,",
    "we introduce for each @xmath22 and @xmath130 such that @xmath197 , the affine map @xmath198 given by @xmath199 notice that it shifts points to the right , and , if @xmath200 , also expands in the @xmath201 direction .",
    "( we shall refer to these maps as _ translations _ although strictly speaking only the @xmath202 are translations . )",
    "the idea is to use the regions @xmath84 and @xmath85 as `` tiles '' to cover a larger region , the tiling being obtained by translating @xmath84 and @xmath85 by the maps @xmath198 .",
    "then we will apply serre duality to obtain the @xmath38 region .    more precisely , recall that @xmath203 , and set @xmath204 ( we will use the notation @xmath205 , and @xmath206 , respectively , for the least integer not smaller , and the largest integer not greater than a given number , the so - called `` ceiling '' and `` floor '' functions ) .",

    "now , for exactly the same reasons as before , this is the best we can do _ as long as _ @xmath256 .",

    "thus in each chain @xmath325 in the construction described earlier , we can gain an extra triangle by replacing@xmath286 by the appropriate @xmath287 .    finally , then",
    ", we _ define _ @xmath38 to be the union of the trapezia constructed above together with their serre duals .",
    "the region @xmath326 is bounded from below by @xmath327 , on the sides by @xmath62 and @xmath265 , and from above by the graph of a seesaw - like function @xmath328 defined on the interval @xmath329 $ ] by @xmath330\\\\ \\frac{s}{g}(\\mu-\\lceil\\mu\\rceil+1)+s & \\mu\\in(\\hat\\eta(s)+1,\\hat\\eta(s+1)-1]\\\\ \\frac{\\hat\\eta(s+1)-s}g(\\mu-\\lceil\\mu\\rceil+1)+s & \\mu\\in(\\hat\\eta(s+1)-1,\\hat\\eta(s+1 ) ] .",

    "figure 6 shows a typical @xmath38 region .",
    "we stress the fact that we have to exclude from @xmath38 those points corresponding to translates of those parts of the boundaries of @xmath84 or @xmath85 which are not included in the original regions , and we can summarize as follows :    _ if @xmath10 lies in or on the polygon defined above , @xmath10 is @xmath12-bn , for many values of @xmath12 , except for @xmath62 and @xmath332 , and possibly for @xmath333 , @xmath334 $ ] , @xmath335 . _",
    "when @xmath0 is not hyperelliptic , mercat has proved recently @xcite that the results of @xcite extend to the case @xmath101 .",
    "the constructions of @xcite are the same as those of @xcite , so the proofs of section 2 still work , except that in lemmas 3.6 and 3.7 , we should replace the condition @xmath142 by @xmath336 .",
    "the effect of this is that those of the points excluded from @xmath38 as above which arise as translates of the right - hand boundary of @xmath85 can be restored .",
    "however those points arising from the left - hand boundary of @xmath84 can not be restored .",
    "thus the only points of the boundary which must be excluded are those of the form @xmath337 with @xmath338 and the points @xmath339 which arise as translates of @xmath340 .    for semistable bundles ,",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite allow us to include both left - hand and right - hand boundaries of @xmath270 ( and indeed the point @xmath340 ) .",
    "so in this case the whole boundary of @xmath38 can be included .",
    "moreover one can include the whole of the line segments @xmath341 .",
    "the analysis in remarks 4.3 and 4.4 works also for @xmath342 and hence whenever @xmath343 ( with the usual exceptions for integral values of @xmath344 ) .",
    "so there is certainly a dense subset of @xmath38 consisting of bn points .    finally , we have the following proposition , showing that the region @xmath38 always `` stays close '' to the bn curve :    let @xmath345 denote the function whose graph is the bn curve .",
    "then , for @xmath346 , @xmath347    _ proof : _ since the graphs of @xmath348 and @xmath328 are both invariant under @xmath266 , it is sufficient to prove this for @xmath349 .    for the first inequality we need to prove that every point of @xmath38 lies on or below the bn curve . since this is certainly true for points of @xmath270 and @xmath350 is invariant under @xmath266 , it is sufficient to prove that , whenever @xmath351 and @xmath319 , @xmath352    a simple calculation shows that @xmath353    for the second inequality , note first that both @xmath348 and its derivative @xmath354 are strictly increasing ( this is easy to see either geometrically or by calculus ) .",
    "it follows from the formulae for @xmath355 and the fact that , by definition of @xmath356 , @xmath357 that it is sufficient to prove the inequalities @xmath358 @xmath359 for @xmath360 and @xmath361 .    since @xmath362 and @xmath354 is strictly increasing , @xmath363 on the other hand @xmath364 proving the first of the required inequalities .",
    "also @xmath365 implies that @xmath366 ; hence @xmath367 .",
    "thus @xmath368and we are done .    a careful analysis of this proof shows that the worst cases for @xmath369 are as @xmath370 from above .",

    "the best possible inequality which is independent of @xmath1 is the one stated in the proposition .",
    "examples of stable bundles which are outside the range to which the constructions of this section apply are given in @xcite and @xcite , and some different examples in @xcite .",
    "we now compare @xmath38 with the corresponding region @xmath40 constructed by the results of teixidor @xcite and mercat @xcite , mainly by means of some examples .    in the stable case ,",
    "teixidor s original result excluded from @xmath28 the vertical segments of length 1 , with upper end at a point _ on _ the bn curve @xmath373 with integer coordinates .",
    "however mercat in @xcite removed this restriction except for the topmost point of each segment , although he needs also to exclude all the points described in the last sentence of the following theorem , while teixidor excluded only those segments whose topmost point lies on the bn curve .",
    "we will quote the results of both as follows :    * ( teixidor / mercat ) * a point @xmath10 determines a non - empty locus @xmath44 if any of the following three conditions holds :    @xmath374    @xmath375    @xmath376    moreover , under the same conditions , @xmath28 is non - empty except possibly for points @xmath10 with @xmath344 , @xmath201 integers and @xmath377 .    in the semistable case ,",
    "this theorem is a mere translation of a result of teixidor ( @xcite , theorem 1 , p. 386 ) to the @xmath10 language ; note that teixidor s result is stated for @xmath0 generic , but for semistable bundles this automatically implies the result for any @xmath0 .",
    "observe that conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fact define triangles in the @xmath10-plane , with all their vertices at points with integer coordinates , as illustrated in figure 7 , where the lighter area corresponds to the first condition and the darker to the second .",
    "condition 3 describes a horizontal segment of length 1 , starting at the point @xmath378 .",
    "as shown in figure 7 , for any point with integer coordinates on or below the bn curve , the first two conditions together determine a parallelogram ; hence , the region defined by theorem 5.1 is sometimes referred to as `` teixidor s parallelograms '' .",
    "we denote this region by @xmath40 .",
    "we can describe the region @xmath40 in a similar way to @xmath38 by first defining , for any integer @xmath130 , @xmath379 then @xmath380 if and only if @xmath381 .",
    "( recall that @xmath218 if and only if @xmath382 . ) the region",
    "@xmath40 is then bounded below by @xmath327 , on the sides by @xmath62 and @xmath59 and from above by the graph of a function @xmath383 defined by @xmath384\\\\ s&\\mu\\in(\\hparti'+1,\\hat\\eta(s+1 ) ' ] \\endcases\\ ] ]    unlike @xmath328 , the function @xmath383 is in fact continuous and non - decreasing , so the shape of @xmath40 is simpler than that of @xmath38 .",
    "note also that the region covered by teixidor s parallelograms is invariant under @xmath266 , so we do not obtain anything new by using serre duality .",
    "finally it is easy to check that @xmath385 ( compare proposition 4.11 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows a typical teixidor polygon ( here , @xmath386 and the only vertex on the bn curve is @xmath387 , since @xmath100 is the only divisor of @xmath388 ) .    to compare the upper boundaries of @xmath40 and @xmath38",
    ", we first note that @xmath389 for @xmath349 , it follows that @xmath390 except possibly in the intervals @xmath391 . if @xmath392 ( or equivalently @xmath393 ) , then @xmath390 in this interval as well . on the other hand , if @xmath394 , then @xmath395 on @xmath391 .",
    "thus @xmath38 always extends outside @xmath40 and , for almost all values of @xmath1 , @xmath40 also extends outside @xmath38 .    at any rate , for a given ( small ) genus , it is easy to compute both @xmath356 and @xmath396 explicitly .",
    "the figures 9 , 10 and 11 , illustrate the cases @xmath397 , @xmath398 , and @xmath399 , respectively , where different situations can be appreciated . there",
    "the shaded area is @xmath38 , and teixidor s polygons are only outlined .",
    "suppose now that @xmath0 is a non - singular hyperelliptic curve of genus @xmath196 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath21 the hyperelliptic line bundle on @xmath0 then @xmath400 for @xmath5 , so we can take @xmath401 in theorem 3.9 .",
    "the analogue of theorem 4.2 is        this region is already invariant under serre duality , so we do not need to invoke the transformations @xmath342 in this case .",

    "the region @xmath410 consists entirely of bn points . by serre duality , so also does @xmath411 i.e. ( replacing @xmath130 by @xmath412 ) @xmath413 of course , all points of @xmath270 are bn , hence also all points of its serre dual .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure 12 .                to prove the theorem , we argue by induction on @xmath130 . for @xmath426 ,",
    "the result is obvious , since @xmath117 stable with @xmath427 implies @xmath428 .",
