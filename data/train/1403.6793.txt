    "suspensions ( solid particles immersed in a fluid ) exhibit a wide range of rheological behaviors , including shear thinning , shear thickening , and finite normal stress differences .",
    "shear thickening  @xcite , where the viscosity increases with shear rate even if the suspending fluid is newtonian , is a particularly intriguing phenomenon . in the extreme case of",
    "discontinuous shear thickening ( dst ; for early descriptions see the work of @xcite ) , which is observed at high volume fractions of solid material , the viscosity can increase by several orders of magnitude at a critical shear rate . note that we do not include here the irreversible shear thickening occurring due to particle aggregation ( as seen for example in fumed silica  @xcite ) under the name dst .",
    "the variety of systems showing a dst suggests that this may be a universal behavior that is obtained with a minimum set of physical ingredients .",
    "even though most of the data available are for brownian suspensions ( that is , sub - micrometer particles )  , thermal motion does not seem necessary to observe dst , as experiments with micrometer scale  @xcite or larger particles  @xcite show .",
    "inertia has also been associated with the existence of shear thickening in suspensions  @xcite , based on the initial ideas of @xcite , but the bagnoldian scaling of a viscosity proportional to the shear rate is clearly milder than the abrupt shear thickening observed in experiments .",
    "more importantly the thickening due to inertia arises at stokes number @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the shear rate , @xmath2 the viscosity of the fluid phase , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 the mass density and size of the solid particles , respectively ) of order @xmath5 in the simulations  @xcite , which contrasts with the values of at most @xmath6 found in experiments ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "thus inertia is not necessary for dst in the conditions probed by rheometric flows .",
    "( flows involving significantly larger particles , say in the range , or significantly larger shear rates @xmath7 , can probe the regime where inertia matters ) .",
    "indeed , the apparently simple experimental system of nearly rigid non - brownian neutrally buoyant particles immersed in a newtonian fluid exhibits dst in the stokes regime  @xcite , indicating that the phenomenon stems from a rather restricted set of simple ingredients .",
    "the puzzle has very few pieces . in the stokes regime , however , non - brownian neutrally buoyant hard spheres in a newtonian fluid will create a suspension whose rheology is independent of shear rate , as there is only one force scale , the hydrodynamic one ( we will further explain this fact in  sec .",
    "[ sec : shearrate_dep ] ) .",
    "so there can not be _ too few _ pieces .",
    "the flow of suspensions has historically been studied from a fluid mechanics perspective , and the emphasis has been on a description based on hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "suspensions are usually described as hard particles immersed in a newtonian fluid , interacting through hydrodynamics ( including brownian forces ) and sometimes an additional soft repulsive potential ( approximating an electric double - layer or mimicking polymer coating , for instance ) .",
    "they are typically studied in the stokes flow regime , at vanishing particle reynolds number @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 the mass density of the fluid phase ) and stokes number .",
    "the key point is that the hard cores of the particles are treated as boundary conditions for the stokes equations that describe the fluid phase ; the particles never directly generate forces through contacts .",
    "this treatment is self - consistently justified by the fact that the stokes flow between two rigid surfaces leads to a lubrication force whose resistance coefficient diverges at contact , effectively preventing two particles from colliding . within this framework ,",
    "shear thickening is explained by the creation at large shear rates of locally denser clusters of particles ( _ hydro - clusters _ ) , which are highly dissipative due to the singular lubrication flows between the particles  @xcite .",
    "while this purely fluid mechanical point of view is able to describe the flow and rheology of moderately concentrated suspensions , it seems unable to explain the abrupt shear thickening observed in highly concentrated suspensions .",
    "simulations by stokesian dynamics give a weak logarithmic shear thickening  @xcite , thereby raising the issue of the validity of this approach at high volume fractions .",
    "moreover , dst is also observed in athermal suspensions , where the shear rate dependence introduced by the brownian force scale disappears : in this regime , a purely hydrodynamic perspective would predict a shear - rate independent rheology .    in the past few years",
    ", new ideas have emerged from the granular rheology perspective .",
    "@xcite developed an analogy between the rheology of suspensions and the rheology of granular materials .",
    "in dry granular flow , the rheology depends on the ratio between inertia and particle pressure  @xcite : if the inertia dominates , particles bounce around and the stresses are essentially due to momentum exchange based on collisions ( a `` granular gas '' regime ) , whereas if the pressure dominates , particles are forced to stay at contact and the stresses are dominated by contact force chains ( a `` granular packing '' regime ) .",
    "this perspective can be incorporated in a dimensionless _ inertial number _",
    "@xmath10  @xcite , where @xmath11 is the diameter of the solid particles , @xmath3 their density , and @xmath12 the particle pressure .",
    "similarly , for suspensions in the stokes regime there is a _ viscous number _",
    "@xmath13 , where @xmath2 is the viscosity of the suspending fluid , which compares viscous dissipation to the particle pressure  @xcite .",
    "the stresses can be dominated either by viscous dissipation if @xmath14 ( when particles are far apart ) or by a contact network if @xmath15 .",
    "this results in constitutive laws for the viscosity and other stress components and for the volume fraction that are unique functions of @xmath16 .",
    "one can anticipate that the regimes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , both of which are dominated by the approach to the jamming transition , will share some similarities .",
    "indeed , they do share a power - law scaling ( typical of the jamming transition ) between particle pressure and distance to the jamming point @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the scaling is the same for the other stress components , including the important case of shear stress @xmath20 .",
    "these power laws are now argued to be a generic behavior close to jamming  @xcite , though the value of the exponent @xmath21 might be system dependent ( it might depend on shape or friction for instance ) . with these ideas ,",
    "the emphasis has shifted from hydrodynamics and detailed microscopic interactions to geometry and steric constraints close to the jamming transition .",
    "while those new ideas have proven to be successful in explaining some of the rheology at high volume fractions  @xcite , they can not account for non - newtonian behavior in the stokes regime .",
    "the case of dst is particularly puzzling : whereas intuition suggests that dst is a manifestation of jamming  @xcite , dst is not captured by the @xmath16-based rheology , which predicts no shear rate dependence in the stokes regime  @xcite , and reduces to a @xmath22-dependent rheology  @xcite .",
    "simply stated , this rheology predicts the correct volume fraction dependence of the viscosity at fixed shear rate , but completely fails at predicting the shear rate dependence at fixed volume fraction .",
    "again , it is worth noticing that this absence of shear rate dependence hints at a missing force ( or time ) scale in the description of dense suspensions .      in this article , which extends and complements a previous publication  @xcite ,",
    "we show how jamming is related to shear thickening and how to escape the apparent contradiction described above .",
    "the starting point is to note that the jamming transition , while it exhibits some generic features that are independent of the microscopic interactions like the scalings described above , retains a clear signature of the microscopic details in the volume fraction at which it occurs .",
    "for instance , it is well known that jamming can occur anywhere between @xmath23 and @xmath24 depending on the friction coefficient @xmath25 between the grains  @xcite .",
    "this means that the relation @xmath26 actually depends on @xmath25 , which in turn implies that the viscosity @xmath27 depends on @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , if there exists a mechanism such that @xmath25 ( or an effective friction coefficient ) varies with the shear rate @xmath28 , one can obtain a non - newtonian rheology within the framework of @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has to be associated with an extra force scale besides the hydrodynamic one in order to provide the shear - rate dependence .",
    "we introduced such a mechanism in the recent article  @xcite , and here we thoroughly explore its consequences through numerical simulations of dense ( i.e. , highly concentrated ) non - brownian suspensions under simple shear flow .",
    "we note that two other recent papers have independently introduced similar but somewhat different mechanisms to achieve a rate - dependent friction coefficient @xmath29 in simple shear flow simulations  @xcite .",
    "both of them prove that interparticle friction is essential to shear thickening of dense suspensions .",
    "in contrast to those works , the present work however show that inertia is inessential to this phenomenon , as we obtain it in an overdamped simulation ( see next section ) .",
    "this is important because results coming from simulations including inertia gives shear thickening at shear rates that are several orders of magnitude larger than the experimental values ( see previous  sec .",
    "[ sec : intro_shearthickening ] ) .",
    "we show here that our inertialess model gives a _ quantitative _ description of shear thickening ( see conclusion  sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "the present work shows the importance of frictional contacts in dense suspension rheology .",
    "of course , particles must form contacts during flow in order for the rheology to depend on the friction coefficient , and here we come up against one consequence of the fluid mechanics perspective .",
    "in fact , it is known that particles do come in contact under flow , even in the dilute limit , perhaps due to surface roughness  @xcite .",
    "one simply has to accept that those contacts , though not essential to the rheology of dilute or semi - dilute suspensions ( as the successes of stokesian dynamics demonstrate ) , become important at large volume fractions . but contacts are a necessity if one thinks of the large volume - fraction limit of jamming ( @xmath30 ) : there is no more room in this limit for lubrication films between particles , and contacts must proliferate and dominate the rheology .",
    "besides enforcing the geometric constraint of no overlapping particles , those contacts bring a new restriction to reorganization at the microscopic level : they carry significant tangential forces due to friction .",
    "it is worth noting that even though the close - range hydrodynamics ( i.e. , lubrication forces ) also generate some tangential forces , they are of a fundamentally different nature . for a relative motion between two nearby particles ,",
    "the normal lubrication force diverges as the inverse of the interparticle gap , whereas the tangential lubrication force diverges only logarithmically with vanishing gap , which means that the effective friction coefficient vanishes in the limit of a small gap .",
    "thus lubrication , as in its literal meaning , provides very little resistance to relative tangential motion compared to relative normal motion .",
    "this stands in contrast to the frictional contact forces , for which the friction coefficient is finite ; i.e. , tangential and normal contact forces are of comparable scale .",
    "it follows that the constraint introduced by contact friction is much more efficient at increasing the viscosity than is lubrication .    describing the physics of contact and motion when the gap between two particles in a suspension is smaller than , say , , is not an easy task .",
    "moreover , one can not expect to find generic behavior , as interactions will vary depending on the nature of the solid particles and of the suspending fluid",
    ". however , this level of detail may not be essential to understanding the physics that emerges at a macroscopic level . at high volume fractions",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the singularity associated with the jamming transition will dominate the rheology of suspensions .",
    "our approach in this work is thus to study the rheology of minimal model systems that include hydrodynamics , a repulsive interaction , and frictional contacts between particles .",
    "these interactions , while being realistic , will be simplified to their essence .",
    "in this section , we will describe our numerical model of a dense non - brownian suspension under shear flow  @xcite . we intend to have a minimal model containing as few physical elements as possible while exhibiting a dst .",
    "even if the model is intended to be as generic as possible , a few parameter choices are necessary . for those choices ,",
    "we try to set values that correspond to a realistic interpretation of a suspension of hard ( say , silica ) spheres with radius in the range , density matched ( or such that the sedimentation occurs over times much larger than the inverse shear rate ) and charge stabilized .",
    "the only parameter that takes an unrealistic value is the particles stiffness , which is smaller in the simulations than in a typical experimental system .",
    "a stiffness comparable to experimental values for silica ( or even pmma ) , would require the use of very small time steps in the simulation in order to resolve the dynamics of the contacts which correspond to an overlap in the range .",
    "we however circumvent this problem by tuning the particle stiffness with applied shear rate such that we get rid of particle deformation effects in the rheology ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : contact_model ] and appendix  [ app : contact_model_full ] for details ) .        in a suspension , the flow of the fluid is described by the navier - stokes equation , while the motion of the particles is given by newton s equation of motion : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass / moment - of - inertia matrix , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the translational and rotational velocity vectors , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the force and torque vectors , respectively .",
    "the right - hand side consists of two different types of forces : some depend only on the configurations @xmath37 of the particles ( e.g. , forces derived from a potential ) , but some also depend on the velocities @xmath33 and @xmath34 , including inelastic contact forces ( e.g. , contacts with dashpot terms ) and fluid - particle interactions ( hydrodynamic interactions ) .",
    "we will study the rheology of this suspension under an imposed simple shear flow field @xmath38 expressed using the vorticity @xmath39 and the rate - of - strain tensor @xmath40 as @xmath41 at a shear rate @xmath28 , a simple shear flow corresponds to the following nonzero elements : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in many experimental flows , including the ones for which shear thickening is typically observed , the particle reynolds number and the stokes number are very small due to the small size of the suspended particles .",
    "this means that the equation of motion for the particles can be studied in its overdamped limit , which is simply a quasi - static force balance equation . as will be discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : hydrodynamic_intereactions ] , [ sec : contact_model ] , and [ sec : repulsion ] below , in this regime the velocity dependence coming from the hydrodynamic interactions and the contact forces has a linear form , and the force balance equation can be written as a linear algebraic relation having the form @xmath44 therefore , our simulation of a suspension under a simple shear flow in the stokes regime requires solving   for the velocities , and obtaining the positions @xmath37 of the particles at any time @xmath45 through time integration of these velocities .      in principle ,",
    "hydrodynamic interactions can be determined by solving the stokes equations , but this is extremely expensive from a computational view point . for dense suspensions , however , the dominant hydrodynamic interactions come from the fluid flow in the narrow gaps between nearby solid particles  @xcite , because the resistance to relative motion becomes singular when the gaps are vanishingly small .",
    "they give rise to pair - wise short range lubrication forces ( as opposed to the many - body nature of the full , long - range hydrodynamic interactions ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the linear relations between velocities and hydrodynamic forces simply contain a contribution from the stokes drag and a contribution from the lubrication : @xmath46 @xmath47 is a diagonal matrix giving stokes drag forces and torques , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are sparse matrices  @xcite .",
    "consistent with our choice of keeping only physically relevant near - distance interactions , we use only the leading terms for the resistance matrices .",
    "physically , the terms included in our model correspond to the squeeze , shear , and pump modes of @xcite ( we do not consider their twist mode , as it is not associated with a divergence of the resistance at contact , and is thus subdominant ) .",
    "defining the non - dimensional gap @xmath50 between particles @xmath51 and @xmath52 having radii @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath55 and the center - to - center unit vector @xmath56 with @xmath57 , the modes associated with relative displacements respectively along and tangential to @xmath58 have singular behaviors with leading terms diverging as @xmath59 and @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the consequence of the singularity in the squeeze mode ( i.e. , along @xmath58 ) is that there should not be any contact between particles  @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , this statement is only true for perfectly idealized situations , and not realistic even for model experimental systems consisting of spherical particles due to , for example , a finite surface roughness  @xcite or a breakdown of the continuity assumption for the fluid at the molecular mean free path scale  @xcite . in order to mimic this reality ,",
    "we regularize the singularities arising in the lubrication resistances by inserting a small cutoff length scale @xmath61  @xcite , which can be thought of as the length scale of the particle surface roughness ; the leading terms we use for normal and tangential displacements then behave as @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the simulations , we set @xmath64 , giving large enough resistance for the squeeze mode compared to the typical hydrodynamic force .",
    "this value is typical for non - brownian particles  @xcite .",
    "the detailed expressions for the resistance matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given in appendix  [ app : resistance_matrices ] .",
    "there are several models that one can use to describe frictional contacts between particles .",
    "we use a stick / slide friction model employing springs and dashpots that is commonly used in granular physics  @xcite .",
    "the normal and tangential components of the force and the torque for particles having radii @xmath53 and @xmath54 are obtained as @xmath65 and fulfill coulomb s friction law @xmath66 . in the above expressions ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are the normal and tangential spring constants , respectively , and @xmath69 is the damping constant .",
    "the normal and tangential velocities are @xmath70 and @xmath71 $ ] . finally , the quantity @xmath72 is the tangential spring stretch .",
    "this contact model could be made more general , but at the price of numerical difficulties ; see  appendix  [ app : contact_model_full ] .",
    "the computation of the tangential spring stretch @xmath72 , described in the following , requires some care , as we have to impose coulomb s law .",
    "we apply an algorithm described in  @xcite . at the time @xmath73 at which the contact @xmath74 is created , we set an unstretched tangential spring @xmath75 . at any further time step @xmath45 in the simulation , the tangential stretch @xmath76 is incremented according to the value of a `` test '' force @xmath77 with @xmath78 . if @xmath79 , the contact is in a static friction state and we update the spring stretch and force as @xmath80 however , if @xmath81 , the contact is in a sliding state and the spring and force are updated as @xmath82 where the direction @xmath83 is the same as the one for the test force , i.e. , @xmath84 . in this case , coulomb s law is not violated , as @xmath85 .",
    "the shear - rate dependence of a suspension requires the existence of a time scale distinct from the inverse shear rate .",
    "a well known case is the one of brownian suspensions , where the inverse shear rate competes with the brownian diffusion time to give a shear - rate dependent rheology .",
    "this competition is adequately measured by a non - dimensionalized shear rate , the pclet number , which is the ratio of the two time scales : @xmath86 .",
    "this quantity can also be thought of as a ratio of two force scales : the typical hydrodynamic force and the typical brownian force .",
    "thus , a shear - rate dependent rheology generically requires at least one other force scale besides the hydrodynamic one .",
    "such a time scale does not exist for non - brownian suspensions of hard spheres in the stokes regime .",
    "the reason is straightforward : the hard sphere force has no typical value , and a hard - sphere contact between two particles can withstand any applied load .",
    "therefore there is nothing with which to compare the hydrodynamic force .",
    "this means that the solutions of the force / torque balance equations   ( i.e. , the particle trajectories ) are independent of the shear rate , leading to a shear - rate independent rheology .",
    "notice that this conclusion holds whether the hard spheres are frictionless or frictional : coulomb s law does not introduce a force scale .",
    "there must be another force scale in the system to provide the shear - rate dependence .",
    "an important point in our model is that , even if we try to mimic a hard sphere suspension , our contact forces actually are elastic forces , thus bringing a natural force scale @xmath87 .",
    "we preserve the shear - rate independent hard sphere behavior by selecting the particle stiffness @xmath67 such that the non - dimensional number based on the stiffness @xmath88 remains much smaller than unity ; i.e. , we stay in the asymptotic regime of nearly hard particles .",
    "we describe the techniques we use to achieve this in our simulation in  appendix  [ app : contact_model_full ] .      the first model we consider is an intentionally simplistic one , arguably the simplest model with an additional force scale besides the hydrodynamic force .",
    "simplicity is the main motivation for this model , as it enables the clear physical discussion one can expect from a minimal model .    in this model ( which we call critical load model , clm ) , we introduce an extra force scale in the friction law itself , namely a threshold normal load @xmath89 to activate friction .",
    "when the normal load is smaller than this threshold , particles interact as frictionless hard spheres .",
    "when the load is beyond the threshold , friction is activated .",
    "overall , the friction law reads : @xmath90 we may consider the clm as the short debye length limit of the electrostatic repulsion model presented below ( sec .  [",
    "sec : es_repulsion_model ] ) .",
    "an electrostatic repulsion is a simple and plausible interaction .",
    "many experimental systems have such a force , as it stabilizes the suspension .",
    "thus , we will consider an electrostatic repulsion model ( erm ) including this ingredient in the simplest form of a repulsive double - layer electrostatic force @xmath91  @xcite . if the debye length @xmath92 is small compared to the radius of the particles , the approximate form @xmath93 can be used . in the simulations ,",
    "we set @xmath94 , meaning a debye length in the range for particles of a few ; see @xcite .",
    "the mechanical stress applied to the suspension arises from the several interactions included in the model : particles disturb the flow , creating hydrodynamic stresses , and they develop force chains via contacts ( and/or electrostatic repulsion for the erm ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic stresslets acting on the particles are given by  @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 and the matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 contain leading terms of the lubrication resistances  @xcite ( see appendix  [ app : resistance_matrices ] ) in a manner consistent with the hydrodynamic forces considered in  sec .",

    "this has the effect of pushing the shear thickening to lower shear rates , as the onset stress @xmath173 is independent of @xmath61 .",
    "the particle stiffness constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 are chosen such that the simulations are run in the asymptotic regime where the dimensionless numbers @xmath247 are very small . in this asymptotic regime ,",
    "the rheology is independent of these stiffness constants .",
    "the debye length @xmath92 governs the shear thinning behavior at low shear rates .",
    "our critical load model can be thought as having a vanishing debye length .",
    "comparing with the electrostatic repulsion model with @xmath248 ( with @xmath4 the radius of the small particles ) , we observe that besides the shear thinning regime , a finite @xmath92 virtually does not affect the shear thickening and the high viscosity state .",
    "we now turn to a quantitative comparison with experimental data .",
    "the main tuning parameter in our description is the force scale @xmath89 for clm ( or @xmath249 for the erm ) .",
    "this parameter sets the onset stress at which shear thickening occurs .",
    "we can estimate this force for a system of @xmath250 silica spheres in water .",
    "we find an electrostatic repulsion at contact of order @xmath251 ( as evaluated in  @xcite with a charge density @xmath252 and a debye length @xmath253 ) .",
    "this gives for our model the stress scale @xmath254 , which together with the non - dimensionalized onset stress @xmath255 obtained the erm model ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : visc_repulsion ] ) gives a predicted onset stress of @xmath256 .",
    "for the very same system , @xcite experimentally find an onset stress of @xmath257 , with which our simulation is thus in good agreement .",
    "thus , our mechanism seems to give a _ quantitative _ description of shear thickening in dense suspensions , even if it would require comparison to more experimental data to be definitely conclusive .",
    "( obtaining a reliable value of the microscopic force scale is rarely feasible in the published data on dst , and this restricts the number of comparisons we can make at the moment . )",
    "although our model assumes non - brownian suspensions , we may expect that the same mechanism explains shear thickening of brownian colloidal suspensions .",
    "indeed , the brownian forces qualitatively play a role similar to the repulsive potential that we use in our erm : at low shear stress , the brownian forces are large enough to randomly open gaps between contacting particles , while at high shear stress this becomes much less likely , as relative trajectories of pairs of particles become smooth at high peclet numbers  @xcite .",
    "the fact that a random noise can relax friction between grains is a known phenomenon in granular matter  @xcite .",
    "friction would then develop in a brownian suspension in a manner very similar to the present work .",

    "we have no way to mimic rigorously hard spheres by using a contact model with springs . to provide the best approximation to hard spheres ,",

    "we introduce a similar criterion for the tangential spring stretch mimicking static friction : we pick @xmath293 so that @xmath294 is smaller than @xmath295 of the particle radius .",
    "we detail below how we fulfill these two conditions and retain hard - sphere like behavior in our simulation .    for a given @xmath22 ,",
    "the largest stress is obtained in the high shear - rate limit .",
    "hence , we start by determining high shear - rate spring constants @xmath296 by running pre - simulations at @xmath297 , where these values are regularly updated with a certain interval until the criteria on the overlap and the tangential spring stretch are fulfilled .",
    "second , a trivial shear - rate dependence comes in if the contact model introduces a force scale in addition to the hydrodynamic one .",
    "avoiding this requires picking the shear rate dependence of @xmath298 and @xmath298 by scaling these parameters with the shear rate ; i.e. , @xmath299 and @xmath300 . with this scaling",
    ", there is no competition between hydrodynamic and contact forces , as they are proportional , so an additional explicit force scale ( as the one in  sec .",
    "[ sec : repulsion ] ) is required to have a shear - rate dependence in our simulation .",
    "also note that as the high shear - rate limit is always the largest viscosity at a given @xmath22 , with this choice of scaling @xmath301 and @xmath302 always fulfill the criteria we set for the overlap and tangential spring stretch .",
    "in this appendix we present a slightly more general contact model than the one presented in the main text .",
    "while the contact model may not deserve a lengthy description in itself , immersing an orthodox contact model in overdamped dynamics leads to non - trivial difficulties , which justifies our use of a simpler version of the model .",
    "a more general stick / slide friction model using springs and dashpots is the following  @xcite : @xmath303 these forces must fulfill coulomb s law of friction : @xmath304 . in the above expression ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are respectively the normal and tangential spring constants , and @xmath69 and @xmath305 are the damping constants",
    ". the normal and tangential relative velocities between two particles @xmath51 and @xmath52 are @xmath306 and @xmath307 $ ] . finally , the quantity @xmath72 is the tangential spring stretch .",
    "the computation of the tangential spring stretch @xmath72 , described in the following , requires some care , as we have to impose coulomb s law , which is made difficult by the overdamped dynamics . at the time @xmath73 at which the contact @xmath265 is created , we set an unstretched tangential spring @xmath75 . at any further time step @xmath45 in the simulation",
    ", the tangential stretch @xmath76 is incremented according to the value of a `` test '' force , @xmath308 with the tentative update of stretch @xmath309 . if @xmath79 , the contact is in a static friction state and we update the spring stretch as @xmath310 and the corresponding tangential force is @xmath311 . however , if @xmath312 , the contact is in sliding state and the spring is updated as @xmath313 , where the direction is the same as the test force , i.e. , @xmath314 .",
    "_ assuming that the velocities are continuous in time _ , this ensures that the contact force will at most weakly violate the coulomb friction law for the next time step , as the force effectively used in the equation of motion will be @xmath315 , so that @xmath316 .    of course , if velocities happen to be discontinuous , the coulomb s law might be violated significantly , and this is the source of one problem when merging this contact model with the hydrodynamic interaction model .",
    "indeed , when contacts are created and destroyed during the flow ( which happens very frequently ) , the overall resistance matrix changes discontinuously , as dashpots are switched on and off .",
    "but , as other position - dependent forces are continuous in time , solving the force balance equation will lead to a discontinuity in velocities when a contact forms or breaks .",
    "this , in turn , leads to large violations of coulomb s law , and hence to numerical instabilities where contacts keep switching between static and dynamic cases at every time step .",
    "another problem occurs when a contact forms ( i.e. , @xmath317 ) : as by definition the normal load on the new contact @xmath318 vanishes ( or is very small in the simulation owing to the finite time - step ) , the finite test force @xmath319 will lead to an immediate rescaling of the tangential spring as @xmath320 ; i.e. , an entirely new finite force appears right at contact time .",
    "these two problems actually also exist in simulations of dry granular matter  @xcite , but they are more acute with an overdamped dynamics because of the direct relation between forces and velocities . in this case ,",
    "any discontinuity in forces or velocities rapidly causes numerical instabilities .",
    "a solution is to use a continuously varying damping @xmath321 such that @xmath322 , which ensures the continuity of forces and velocities  @xcite at the cost of increased complexity of the model .",
    "the solution that we prefer using here is to eliminate of the tangential dashpot by setting @xmath323 . in any case",
    ", this dashpot has no physical significance , and it is only used in granular matter simulations as an efficient numerical stabilizer . in our already overdamped context ,",
    "as long as the hydrodynamic resistance associated with tangential motion is not too small , we do not need such an extra resistive stabilizer , and we do not face any major difficulty by simply dropping this dashpot .",
    "we can quantify this assertion by looking at the relaxation times associated with a contact . both normal and tangential contacts have relaxation times .",
    "for the normal part , it is the one of a spring and dashpot system , @xmath324 . for the tangential part",
    ", the damping is provided by the hydrodynamic resistance , which we here simply denote @xmath325 , so that @xmath326 . on the one hand , in order to have a stable numerical scheme , one should chose these relaxation times large enough compared to the time step @xmath327 , @xmath328 . on the other hand , contacts of hard spheres should react instantaneously to any external load , so physics imposes relaxation times smaller than other typical times @xmath327 , @xmath329 . for the normal part of the contact , we are free to choose the damping @xmath69 to achieve this . for the tangential part",
