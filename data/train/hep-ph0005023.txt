    "charm hadrons in photon nucleus interactions at typical fixed target experiment energies , are expected to be produced predominantly by photon - gluon fusion followed by fragmentation .    as @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks in the @xmath3 process",
    "are produced at the same rate , apart from a tiny @xmath2 excess appearing from next to leading order ( nlo ) contributions  @xcite , the final charm hadron and anti - hadron cross sections should be approximately the same . furthermore , associated production , which together with leading particle effects ( lpe ) has been observed to play an important role in the hadroproduction asymmetries for charm and anti - charm particles  @xcite .",
    "this should not induce charge asymmetries in photoproduction since the effects are the same for particles than for anti - particles within this scheme .",
    "however , the slac hybrid photon facility collaboration  @xcite has reported a noticeable charge asymmetry in meson photoproduction .",
    "this result has been confirmed more recently by the e691  @xcite and the e687  @xcite charm photoproduction experiments . actually , the e687 collaboration presented results on charge asymmetries in @xmath4 and @xmath5 photoproduction which are consistent , at a three sigma level , with a positive asymmetry .",
    "results on @xmath6 , @xmath7 and even @xmath8 photoproduction asymmetries , from both the e687 and the e691 experiments , are less clear since the error bars are still large to be conclusive , but all these measurements seems to indicate a small charge asymmetry ( see table  [ tab1 ] for a summary of the e687 and e691 results ) .",
    ".@xmath9 antiparticle / particle ratio .",
    "the @xmath10 was the statistically most significant sample of the e691 experiment ( they saw a raw signal of @xmath11 events , see ref .",
    "results of the e687 collaboration were taken from ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 become less important as the photon energy rises up , indicating that any charge asymmetry arising from the resolved photon component must decrease with the photon energy , @xmath14 .",
    "we have tried to explain the observed charge asymmetry in photoproduction experiments using the resolved component of the photon . we have found that even when this part is small for typical fixed target energies the charge asymmetry raised from recombination is within errors consistent with the more recent measurements of e687 .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite gives a larger asymmetry than our approach but given the accuracy of experimental data it is still hard to be conclusive on the responsible production mechanism .",
    "we expect that e831/focus  @xcite with its one million of charm reconstructed candidates shed light on the issue ."
