    "the caloric curve obtained from the collision of @xmath8 on @xmath9 at 1 @xmath5gev in the eos collaboration experiment @xcite also shows a plateau at @xmath10 mev ; this is not as prominent as in the earlier case .",
    "however , the heat capacity @xmath1 derived from this caloric curve of the eos group shows a peaked structure at @xmath10 mev indicating existence of a phase transition . even at a relatively low bombarding energy of 47 @xmath5mev @xcite for several reactions ,",
    "it has been seen recently that the caloric curves show plateau at @xmath11 mev in the excitation energy range of @xmath12 to @xmath13 mev per nucleon",

    "the calculated transition temperatures are still somewhat higher than the observed ones , the caloric curves do not match exactly the ones derived from experiments , but the calculations in ref.@xcite give unmistakable signals of the liquid - gas phase transition in the finite size nuclear systems .",

    "in contrast to the non - relativistic models , the rmf theory uses a single set of parameters to explain all these properties",

    "a brief outline of the calculations of the relevant thermodynamic quantities in the relativistic thomas fermi approximation is presented in this section .",

    "the field tensors of the vector mesons and of the electromagnetic fields have the following structure : @xmath32    the equations of motion are obtained from the variational principle .",
    "the mean field approximation is introduced at this stage by treating the fields as @xmath33numbers or classical fields .",

    "the results of our calculations of the caloric curve for these nuclei are next presented .",
    "a host of parameter sets for the nonlinear @xmath83 model are available which produce almost similar ground state properties of nuclei over the whole periodic table but with widely different values of nuclear incompressibility ( @xmath84 ) . to study the effects of different @xmath84 on the results of our calculations",
    ", we have chosen the parameter sets nl1 , nl3 and nlsh @xcite having @xmath84 equal to 212 , 272 and 356 mev , respectively .",
    "the eos of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter in the rtf theory has already been calculated by m@xmath85ller and serot @xcite . for comparison of results for finite nuclei obtained with a given set of parameters and also for completeness , we have repeated the calculations for infinite systems with the same given parameter set . in fig.1 ,",
    "the isotherms of symmetric nuclear matter ( top panel ) and asymmetric nuclear matter ( bottom panel ) with @xmath86 = 0.2 are displayed .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is defined as @xmath87 .",
    "the abscissa refers to @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) where @xmath90 is the saturation density of normal nuclear matter given by @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "the isotherms are calculated with the nl3 parameter set and are shown for a few temperatures , at and around the critical temperature @xmath93 . for symmetric matter , @xmath93 is 14.2 mev whereas for the asymmetric matter considered , it is 13.6 mev .",
    "the isotherms resemble closely those obtained for the van der waals systems and are not quantitatively very different from those found in the nonrelativistic approach @xcite .",
    "the dashed and the dotted lines in the figure are the liquid - gas coexistence line and the spinodal line , respectively . with the other parameter sets , the results are very similar ; however , the critical temperature is found to increase and the critical volume becomes smaller for the parameter set which gives larger incompressibility . the critical temperature and the critical volume for the different parameter sets",
    "are given in table i.    for the symmetric infinite system , the liquid - gas coexistence line is obtained from the maxwell construction as it is effectively a one - component system . here",
    "the pressure and the chemical potential in the two phases are the same at a fixed temperature ( gibbs criteria ) throughout their coexistence for any value of @xmath94 where @xmath94 is the liquid volume fraction ( the gas volume fraction is @xmath95 ) .",
    "then the neutron - proton asymmetry is zero in both phases for all values of @xmath94 .",
    "the asymmetric nuclear matter is a two - component system ; here for any @xmath94 , not only that the gibbs criteria are to be fulfilled for thermodynamical coexistence of the liquid and gas phases , the overall asymmetry ( neutron - proton ratio ) has to be conserved which introduces added complications .",
    "now , the pressure , chemical potentials and the neutron - proton ratio in both phases are in general changing functions of the volume fraction @xcite .",
    "we have taken these factors into account to determine the liquid - gas coexistence region .",
    "the spinodals shown in fig.1 are the isothermal spinodals referring to mechanical instability .",
    "the diffusive spinodal @xcite for the asymmetric matter is not shown here .",
    "finite nuclei ( even symmetric ones ) with coulomb interaction switched on behave like two - component systems .",
    "however , the ideas expounded earlier for asymmetric nuclear matter for the construction of the liquid - gas coexistence lines can not be employed to the case of finite systems .",
    "the density in finite nuclei is not uniform unlike infinite nuclear matter which is homogeneous in either the liquid or the gas phase . for asymmetric infinite system",
    ", we have found that for the liquid - gas coexistence , in general the neutron - proton ratio in the gas phase is much larger than that in the liquid phase .",
    "there is thus a phase separation between the neutrons and protons . for the construction of the isotherms for finite nuclei ,",
    "the system is enclosed in a finite volume ; then the self - consistent solution of the density profiles does not allow any significant neutron - proton phase separation because of the strong attractive unlike pair interactions compared to the interaction among the like pairs .",
    "indeed , from numerical calculations , we find that the @xmath96 ratio throughout the nuclear volume is nearly the same ( not varying by more than 10% ) at all temperatures beyond @xmath97 3.0 mev . for a two - component thermodynamic system ,",
    "liquid - gas coexistence occurs along the maxwell - line ( constant pressure , equal areas in the unstable phases in the @xmath98 diagram ) if the ratio of the concentrations of the components are the same in the two phases as it is then effectively a one - component system .",
    "it is known that for small finite one - component systems , the pressure in the coexistence region may have a small negative slope @xcite in the @xmath98 plane , but for symmetric nuclei with coulomb switched off , we find numerically that the conventional maxwell construction is an excellent approximation as the differences in the chemical potentials on both ends of the maxwell line are negligibly small .",
    "it is found that for the asymmetric finite nuclei under study ( even with coulomb on ) , the difference in the neutron or the proton chemical potentials at the ends of the maxwell line is typically @xmath64 0.2 mev only which is around 30 - 40 times smaller compared to that for infinite nuclear matter with the same asymmetry .",
    "we therefore expect that for these finite systems , for the determination of the liquid - gas coexistence , conventional maxwell construction may not be a poor approximation to which we have resorted to in the present calculations for the nuclei considered .",
    "the isotherms for the lightest nucleus @xmath80 and the heaviest nucleus @xmath82 that we consider are shown in figures 2 and 3 , respectively for the parameter set nl3 .",
    "the results with the other parameter sets are not displayed as they look very similar .",
    "the finite size effects and the coulomb interactions between protons do not change the qualitative character of the isotherms , the only effects are the lowering of the critical temperature and raising of the critical volume to some extent . the coexistence lines and the isothermal spinodal lines are shown by the dashed and the dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the critical temperatures and the critical volumes for different parameter sets are shown in table i. the finite size effects as well as the coulomb interaction tend to reduce the critical temperature . to isolate the coulomb effect , the critical parameters for @xmath82",
    "are also displayed in table i switching off the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is seen that the coulomb interaction lowers @xmath93 for @xmath82 by about 1 mev .",
    "the nature of eos shows that it is possible to have a liquid - gas phase transition in a finite nuclear system below the critical temperature @xmath93 if it is prepared suitably in thermodynamic equilibrium .    to make a quantitative comparison of the results in the rtf theory with those obtained in the non - relativistic thomas - fermi ( nrtf ) framework @xcite , the nrtf results for the critical temperatures and the critical volumes for nuclear matter and for the nucleus @xmath82",
    "are also given in table i. the nrtf calculations were performed with a modified seyler - blanchard ( sbm ) effective interaction which gives @xmath99 mev .",
    "this lies in between those obtained with nl1 and nl3 parameter sets .",
    "however , it is seen that the critical parameters for the sbm calculations are in between nl3 and nlsh for infinite nuclear matter and close to those obtained with the nl3 parameter set for finite systems . the nature of the eos and the critical parameters are controlled by the single - particle potential and the effective mass . to compare these quantities in the rtf and in the nrtf models , we display in fig .",
    "4 the nucleon single - particle potential as a function of the nuclear density ( scaled with the normal nuclear density @xmath90 ) for symmetric nuclear matter as given in the two models . the single particle potential in the rtf is taken to be @xmath100 as given by eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) . the corresponding effective masses are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the sbm single - particle potential is very close to that obtained with the nl1 parameter set at lower densities which evolves towards that generated with the nl3 parameter set with increasing density .",
    "the effective mass in the nrtf model is only a few percent lower at low densities and near the normal nuclear matter density it becomes somewhat higher compared to those obtained in the rtf model .",
    "the single particle potential for protons as a function of distance from the centre of the nucleus ( @xmath82 ) in the two models corresponding to the ground state and at a temperature @xmath101 mev are shown in the top and the bottom panels of fig .",
    "6 , respectively .",
    "the neutron single - particle potentials ( not shown ) have very similar behavior .",
    "it is seen that the potentials obtained in the nrtf model and those obtained with the different parameter sets in the rtf models are quite close .",
    "the effective mass for finite nuclei in the two models is consistent with that shown in fig.5 , i.e. , the nrtf model yields effective mass which is a little higher at the center and lower at the surface compared to the rtf ones .",
    "the above results clearly demonstrate the closeness of the single - particle potential and the effective mass in the non - relativistic and in the relativistic framework .",
    "so it is natural to expect that the eos and the related thermodynamic properties would not be very different .",
    "we have remarked before that the density and hence the observables depend on the volume in which the nucleus at finite temperature is confined .",
    "the calculation of the excitation energy as a function of temperature ( the caloric curve ) is thus volume dependent . in the experimental situation with energetic heavy ion collision",
    ", it is generally assumed that the hot nuclear system prepared after the collision expands substantially beyond its normal size ( @xmath102 times @xmath66 ) and then undergoes fragmentation due to density instabilities .",
    "guided by the practice that many theoretical calculations for heavy ion collisions are done by imposing that thermalization occurs in a freeze - out volume , we fix a volume and then find the caloric curve . the freeze - out volume @xmath63 is determined by @xmath62 occuring in eqs .",
    "( [ epart ] ) - ( [ entropy ] ) as @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath104 is the radius parameter corresponding to the normal nuclear volume @xmath66 ; it is taken to be 1.2 fm .    in order to see",
    "the signature of liquid - gas phase transition , it is evident that the freeze - out volume is to be chosen beyond the critical volume @xmath105 .",
    "it is seen from table i that for the nuclei considered , @xmath106 times @xmath66 .",
    "we have fixed the freeze - out volume as @xmath107 for our calculations . in fig .",
    "7 , the caloric curves for the nuclei @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are displayed with the three different parameter sets .",
    "the caloric curves are seen to be nearly independent of the parameter sets . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the excitation energy per particle @xmath7 increases quadratically with temperature similar to that in a fermi gas ; for @xmath108 between 5 - 10 mev , the caloric curve exhibits a shoulder and beyond that with a kink @xmath7 rises linearly with temperature as observed for a classical gas . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "7 the data for experimental caloric curves for the aladin and the eos collaboration are also shown .",
    "it is noted that the calculated caloric curves show shoulders at temperatures significantly higher than those obtained from experiments . this may be attributed to ( i ) the neglect of fluctuations in the theory which is expected to play important role near the transition temperature and ( ii ) the neglect of collective flow which lowers the transition temperature appreciably as seen in the non - relativistic calculations @xcite .",
    "the specific heat @xmath1 defined by eq .",
    "( [ cv ] ) for the three parameter sets are shown in figs . 8 and 9 for the three systems studied . except for the top pannel in fig .",
    "8 , the calculations reported are done at the freeze - out volume @xmath107 .",
    "the heat capacity shows a sharp peak signalling the liquid - gas phase transition , the peaks occurring at those temperatures where the caloric curve exhibits a kink .",
    "it is found that the harder the eos the larger the transition temperature ( @xmath109 ) and the sharper the peak . in the top panel of fig .",
    "8 , the specific heat for @xmath80 with a freeze - out volume 4@xmath66 is displayed . instead of a sharp peak",
    ", it shows a broad bump at @xmath110 mev . here",
    "the freeze - out volume is less than the critical volume , we do not associate this bump with a liquid - gas phase transition ; it possibly signals a precursor to the transition .",
    "the evolution of the density distributions for the three systems around the phase transition temperature @xmath109 are displayed in figs .",
    "10 and 11 .",
    "the calculations are done in a freeze - out volume 8@xmath66 . in fig .",
    "10 , the density distribution for @xmath80 with the parameter sets nl3 ( top panel ) and nlsh ( bottom panel ) are shown . at low temperatures ,",
    "the density is more like a woods - saxon profile ; with increasing temperature , the central density depletes and a long tail spreading to the boundary develops as is shown by the dashed line at @xmath108 = 0.9@xmath109 . with further increase in temperature to @xmath109 and a little beyond",
    ", the density distribution tends to be uniform as is evident from the solid line ( @xmath108 = @xmath109 ) and the dotted line ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "it is found that the evolution of density with temperature is nearly independent of the parameter sets and therefore for the nuclei @xmath81 and @xmath82 calculations with only nl3 parameter sets are shown in fig.11 .",
    "for these nuclei too the evolution of density is very similar to that in @xmath80 .",
    "the rapid change in the density distribution towards a uniform one as the temperature approaches @xmath109 is a further indication of a liquid - gas phase transition in these finite systems .    for symmetric nuclear matter , at a fixed temperature ,",
    "the pressure remains constant over the whole coexistence region .",
    "the gibbs free energy per particle @xmath112 then shows a kink at the transition temperature when the pressure is held constant .",
    "its derivative with respect to temperature , the entropy function , then shows a discontinuity there . for asymmetric nuclear matter , it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the liquid - gas phase transition is second - order , the continuous transition becoming more conspicuous with increasing asymmetry . there",
    "the pressure is not constant but shows a negative slope in the coexistence region for an isotherm in the @xmath98 plane .",
    "thus at constant pressure , the end points of the coexistence line are at different temperatures , then the kink in the gibbs free energy @xmath112 disappears and the entropy function becomes continuous with kinks at the end points of the transition .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition thus occurs over a finite temperature interval . for finite nuclei ,",
    "the exact calculation of the thermodynamic functions in the coexistence region is nontrivial and still not known , but as explained earlier in the beginning of this section , we expect the pressure in this region to remain close to a constant ; it is then obvious that the entropy at constant pressure would show a discontinuity at a transition temperature as shown in fig.12 indicating a first - order phase transition .",
    "precise statement about the order of the phase transition in finite nuclei can be made only if the exact calculations of the partition functions and hence the thermodynamic variables are rendered posssible .",
    "the present mean - field theory shows that the liquid - gas phase transition in finite nuclei has characteristics closer to a first - order transition .",
    "this is in consonance with the results obtained in the lattice gas model @xcite .",
    "no definite conclusion can however be reached from the experimental data ; the gsi data @xcite indicate a first - order phase transition whereas the analyses of the eos data @xcite show that the transition may be second - order .",
    "the relativistic mean - field theory which has been very successful in describing the ground state properties of nuclear systems has been applied for the first time in evaluating the equation of state of finite nuclei in this paper .",
    "we have resorted to a relativistic self - consistent thomas - fermi theory with the non - linear @xmath113 version of the lagrangian .",
    "it is found that the results do not differ qualitatively from those obtained in a non - relativistic approach .",
    "this is due to the fact that the single particle potential and the effective mass which control the relevant observables are very similar .",
    "the calculations have been done with three parameter sets with very different nuclear incompressibilities , still the eos look nearly the same and the critical parameters are not too different .",
    "the critical parameters for finite nuclei are appreciably different from those of the infinite system .",
    "the specific heat @xmath1 calculated from the caloric curve shows peaked structures signalling liquid - gas phase transition in the nuclei studied .",
    "the near uniformity of the density distribution as the system approaches the transition temperature confirms this further .",
    "analysis of the thermodynamical quantities indicates that this liquid - gas phase transition in the finite nuclei is more compatible with a first - order one .",
