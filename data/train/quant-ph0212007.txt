    "quantum entanglement arises as a joint consequence of the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the quantum mechanical state space of composite quantum systems .",
    "one of the main concerns of a theory of quantum entanglement is to find mathematical tools that are capable of appropriately quantifying the extent to which composite quantum systems are entangled .",
    "entanglement measures are functionals that are constructed to serve that purpose @xcite .",
    "initially it was hoped for that a number of natural requirements reflecting the properties of quantum entanglement would be sufficient to establish a unique functional that quantifies entanglement in bi - partite quantum systems @xcite .",
    "these requirements are the non - increase ( monotonicity ) of the functional under local operations and classical communication , the convexity of the functional ( which amounts to stating that the loss of classical information does not increase entanglement ) and the asymptotic continuity .",
    "indeed , for pure quantum states these contraints essentially define a unique measure of entanglement .",
    "this uniqueness originates from the fact that pure - state entanglement can asymptotically be manipulated in a reversible manner @xcite under local operations with classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "however , for mixed states there is no such unique measure of entanglement , at least not under locc ( see however , @xcite ) .",
    "instead , it depends very much on the physical task underlying the quantification procedure what degree of entanglement is associated with a given state .",
    "the distillable entanglement grasps the resource character of entanglement in mathematical form : it states how many maximally entangled two - qubit pairs can asymptotically be extracted from a supply of identically prepared quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of formation @xcite  or rather its asymptotic version , the entanglement cost under locc @xcite  quantifies the number of maximally entangled two - qubit pairs that are needed in an asymptotic preparation procedure of a given state .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite is an intermediate measure : it has an interpretation in terms of statistical distinguishability of a given state of the closest disentangled state .",
    "this set of disentangled states could be the set of separable states , or the set of states with a positive partial transpose ( ppt states ) .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement quantifies , roughly speaking , to what minimal degree a machine performing quantum measurements could tell the difference between a given state and any disentangled state @xcite .",
    "it is not unthinkable that the optimal disentangled state may already be distinguishable from the primary state using selective local operations , rather than global ones .",
    "yet , it would be interesting to see what measures of entanglement would arise if one considered only those disentangled states that can not be distinguished locally from the primary state , specifically that both states have identical reductions with respect to both parts of the bi - partite quantum system . in this sense one asks for the degree to which the two states can be distinguished in a genuinely non - local manner .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to pursue this program .",
    "we will discuss three different entanglement measures that are related to this distinguishability problem .",
    "each of these entanglement measures is based on a different state space distance measure , namely on the relative entropy , the relative entropy with interchanged arguments and the trace - norm distance .",
    "the properties of these entanglement measures have not been studied so far .",
    "we will show that these three quantities are entanglement monotones , thereby qualifying them as proper measures of entanglement .",
    "an interesting byproduct of this work is the result that the relative entropy of entanglement with interchanged arguments is strongly additive , which means that @xmath0 for all states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "strong additivity implies weak additivity , i.e.  @xmath3 for all states @xmath4 and all @xmath5 .",
    "if one can interpret an entanglement measure as a kind of cost function , weak additivity can be interpreted as the impossibility to get a wholesale discount on a state .",
    "many measures of entanglement are known to be subadditive , such as the relative entropy of entanglement and the non - asymptotic entanglement of formation .",
    "furthermore , all regularized asymptotic versions of entanglement measures are , by definition , weakly additive .",
    "as no strongly additive measure of entanglement has been found so far , one might be led to doubt whether the requirements of ( i ) monotonicity , ( ii ) strong additivity , and ( iii ) convexity are compatible at all .",
    "we will show , however , that the relative entropy of entanglement with interchanged arguments , and taken with respect to the set of disentangled states with the same reductions as the primary state , obeys each one of these three requirements , proving that there is no a priori incompatibility between them .",
    "it has to be noted , though , that this result is of a rather technical nature , as this measure of entanglement , while being physically meaningful , is not very practical : it yields infinity for any pure entangled state .",
    "in this work we will consider bi - partite systems consisting of parts @xmath6 and @xmath7 , each of which is equipped with a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the set of density operators of the joint system will be denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be either the set of separable states or the set of ppt states , which is the subset of @xmath10 which consists of the states @xmath2 for which the partial transpose @xmath11 is a positive operator . in the following , we will consider the proper subset @xmath12 which consists of all those separable states ( or ppt states ) that are locally identical to @xmath2 , @xmath13 in this definition , subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote state reductions to the subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the quantities that will be considered in this paper are all distance measures with respect to this set : @xmath14 where @xmath15\\ ] ] is the relative entropy @xcite , and @xmath16 stands for the trace norm @xcite .    the quantity @xmath17 in eq .",

    "the original relative entropy of entanglement with respect to the set @xmath9 ( meaning either separable or ppt states ) is an entanglement measure that has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",

    "this statement will be made more precise in section vi .",
    "the properties of @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath20 that will be investigated consist of the following well - known list of ( non - asymptotic ) properties of proper entanglement measures @xcite :    * if @xmath21 is separable , then @xmath22 .",

    "<S> we investigate the properties of three entanglement measures that quantify the statistical distinguishability of a given state with the closest disentangled state that has the same reductions as the primary state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we concentrate on the relative entropy of entanglement with reversed entries . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this quantity is an entanglement monotone which is strongly additive , thereby demonstrating that monotonicity under local quantum operations and strong additivity are compatible in principle . in accordance with the presented statistical interpretation which is provided , this entanglement monotone </S>",
    "<S> , however , has the property that it diverges on pure states , with the consequence that it can not distinguish the degree of entanglement of different pure states . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that the relative entropy of entanglement with respect to the set of disentangled states that have identical reductions to the primary state is an entanglement monotone . </S>",
    "<S> we finally investigate the trace - norm measure and demonstrate that it is also a proper entanglement monotone . </S>"
