    "in the last decade it has been reached a general consensus that ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) create a hot and dense strongly interacting quark and gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "a main discovery has been that the qgp has a very small shear viscosity to density entropy , @xmath0 , which is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the one of water  @xcite , and close to the lower bound of @xmath9 conjectured for systems at infinite strong coupling @xcite .",
    "a key observable to reach such a conclusion is the elliptic flow  @xcite , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the azimuthal angle in the transverse plane and the average meant over the particle distribution . in fact , the expansion of the created matter generates a large anisotropy of the emitted particles that can be primarily measured by @xmath12 .",
    "an hadronic system would generate a @xmath12 about a factor 2 - 3 smaller than the measured one @xcite and this is one of the hints that the system created at rhic and lhc is of non - hadronic nature .",
    "the origin of @xmath12 is the initial spatial eccentricity , @xmath13 of the overlap region in non - central collisions , which is responsible for different pressure gradients in the transverse plane thus favoring flow preferably along the @xmath14 direction rather than @xmath15 direction .",
    "the observed large @xmath12 is considered a signal of a very small @xmath0 because it means that the system is very efficient in converting @xmath16 into an anisotropy in the momentum space @xmath12 , a mechanism that would be strongly damped in a system highly viscous that dissipates and smooths anisotropies @xcite .",
    "quantitatively both viscous hydrodynamics @xcite , and transport boltzmann - like approaches  @xcite agree in indicating an average @xmath0 of the qgp lying in the range @xmath17 .",
    "along with the existence of a deconfined qgp matter and the understanding of its properties , the urhic program offers the opportunity to verify the picture in which at vey high energy the two colliding nuclei are described as two sheets of color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite , see  @xcite for reviews .",
    "the cgc in the nuclei would be primarily generated by the very high density of the gluon distribution function at low @xmath14 ( parton momentum fraction ) , which triggers a saturation of the distribution for @xmath3 below a saturation scale , @xmath18 .",
    "the determination of the shear viscosity @xmath0 of the qgp and the search for the cgc are related .",
    "in fact , the main source of uncertainty for @xmath0 comes from the unknown initial conditions of the created matter  @xcite that imply quite different eccentricities @xmath16 .",
    "a simple geometrical description through the glauber model  @xcite predicts a @xmath16 smaller at least 25 - 30@xmath19 than the eccentricity of the cgc , for most of the centralities of the collisions , see for example results within the kharzeev - levin - nardi ( kln ) model  @xcite , factorized kln ( fkln ) model  @xcite , monte carlo kln ( mc - kln ) model  @xcite and dipole model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the saturation of gluon distribution function is stronger in the central overlapping region , making the space distribution sharper than the one coming from a simple geometrical overlap .",
    "other cgc models like the ones based on the solution of the classic yang - mills ( cym ) equations predict a somewhat smaller initial eccentricity  @xcite .",
    "however the effect we discuss in the present paper is mainly related to the saturation effect in momentum space and not in the @xmath20space that determines the eccentricity , even if certainly to consider cym initial conditions is an important task considering the success it has in predicting the collective flow anisotropies @xmath21 with @xmath22 @xcite .    in this article , we report our results about the computation of the elliptic flow of the quark - gluon - plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions , simulating the expansion of the fireball by solving the relativistic boltzmann equation for the parton distribution function tuned at a fixed shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0  @xcite . in this context",
    "the advantage of using kinetic theory is that starting from a one - body phase space distribution function @xmath23 , and not from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath24 , it is straightforward to initialize simulations from a non - equilibrium distribution function , like the one characterizing the kln model , while the hydrodynamics relies on the gradient expansion of the stress tensor and therefore is applicable only if initial deviations from local equilibrium are small .",
    "it is worth noticing that kinetic theory has also attracted interest as a tool to derive equations for the hydrodynamical evolution of a fluid starting from a microscopic theory  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we assume that the initial condition in configuration and momentum space arising from the melting of the cgc is given by the kln model .",
    "in fact the kln initial condition that has been largely employed to study the dynamics of hic and the viscosity of the qgp @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the initial condition translates into an uncertainty on @xmath0 of at a least a factor of two as estimated by mean of several viscous hydrodynamical approaches @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the experimental data of @xmath25 at the highest rhic energy are in agreement with a fluid with @xmath26 according to viscous hydrodynamics simulation , assuming a standard glauber initial condition . assuming an initial fkln or mc - kln space distribution the comparison favors a fluid at @xmath27 .",
    "the reason is the larger initial @xmath16 of the fkln , which leads to larger @xmath12 unless a large @xmath0 is considered .",
    "we point out that the implementation of the shattered cgc initialization in hydrodynamics takes into account only the different space distribution respect to a geometric glauber model , discarding the key and more peculiar feature of the damping of the distribution for @xmath3 below the @xmath18 saturation scale .",
    "we have found by mean of kinetic theory that this has a significant impact on the build - up of @xmath12 .    in order to frame our work correctly , we refer to the standard picture of the evolution of the fireball produced in the heavy ion collision , so we can identify the moment in which our approach is valid .",
    "the commonly accepted picture goes as follows : at @xmath28 the two high energy colliding nuclei are described as two thin sheets of color - glass condensate , which after the collision turns at @xmath29 into an out - of - equilibrium glasma state , which consists of a background of chromomagnetic and chromoelectric flux tubes , on the top of which quantum fluctuations are produced and cause the decay of the glasma itself to a partong liquid as the system expands .",
    "this parton system then equilibrates and the evolution is governed by viscous hydro . during the very early evolution of the glasma , the initial negative longitudinal pressure becomes positive because of the breaking of the color strings , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the decay causes the fields become very weak within a fraction of fm / c : we denote this time by @xmath30 . from this time a description of the system as a pure interacting partons liquid becomes reliable , and can be described by kinetic theory .",
    "we therefore start our simulations from @xmath30 .",
    "we assume @xmath31 fm / c in this work ; however we have checked that our main results on the elliptic flow are not affected significantly by shifting the initial time to reasonably larger times . within our framework the longitudinal pressure @xmath32 at @xmath33 is positive , in agreement with recent calculations within classic - yang mills statistical approach @xcite or within kinetic theory at fixed @xmath0 with a gauge field in abelian dominance @xcite .",
    "our main purpose in this study is to take into account strong deviations from local equilibrium in the initial condition , which naturally arise when the kln model is used in the calculations : these kind of deviations are not affordably treated within viscous hydrodynamics even if in principle non vanishing bulk and shear energy tensor at @xmath30 may account for it . anyway , we will show that our description reproduces the hydrodynamics results when a proper thermalized initial condition is prepared in our simulations .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the initial conditions we use in the simulations , namely the factorized glasma the glauber initial conditions . in section iii , we review our approach to kinetic theory at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "in section iv , we present our results on thermalization and isotropization of the fireball , as well as on the time evolution of the parton distribution function in the expanding system . in section",
    "v , we present and discuss our results on the elliptic flow . finally in section",
    "vi , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in order to prepare the initial condition in coordinate and momentum space of a melted glasma state we adopt the model which was firstly introduced by kharzeev , levin and nardi  @xcite ( kln model ) , with particular reference to the factorized - kln ( fkln ) approach as introduced in  @xcite , in which the coordinate space distribution function of gluons arising from the melted glasma is assumed to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 corresponds to the momentum space distribution in the @xmath36 factorization hypothesis  @xcite , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . here",

    "is @xmath40 gev@xmath41 for the case of au - au collisions at @xmath42 gev , while we take @xmath43 gev@xmath41 for the case of pb - pb collisions at @xmath44 tev ; @xmath45 denotes the strong coupling constant , which is computed at the scale @xmath46 according to the one - loop @xmath47 function but frozen at @xmath48 in the infrared region as in  @xcite . in eq .",
    "@xmath49 denote the probability to find one nucleon at a given transverse coordinate , namely @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the inelastic cross section and @xmath52 corresponds to the usual thickness function of the glauber model .",
    "equation   is based on the factorization hypothesis , which is known to work fairly in the case of proton - proton as well as proton - nucleus collisions but it is violated in the case of a nucleus - nucleus collision  @xcite . however , we do not aim at considering the exact spectrum of a glasma , that may be computed for example within the cym approach  @xcite ; rather we wish to study another issue , that is how the initial nonequilibrium distribution in momentum space , in particular one with a saturation scale built in , affects the building up of the elliptic flow .",
    "furthermore , the kln initial condition is still largely employed in hydrodynamics simulations to test the impact of initial conditions on different observables @xcite . for simplicity , and also to uniform our language to that commonly adopted in hydro simulations , we still refer to the initial condition specified by eq .   as to the melted - glasma initial condition .",
    "the main ingredient to specify in eq .   is the unintegrated gluon distribution function ( ugdf ) for partons coming from nucleus @xmath53 , which is assumed to be : @xmath54~ , \\label{eq : phia}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which embeds saturation of the distribution for @xmath55 ; a similar equation holds for partons belonging to nucleus @xmath56 .",
    "following  @xcite we take the saturation scale for the nucleus @xmath53 as @xmath57 with @xmath58 , and similarly nucleus @xmath56 .",
    "the scale @xmath59 regulates the average value of the saturation scale on the transverse plane .",
    "equation implies that for a fixed value of @xmath14 , the larger the nucleon density the larger the saturation scale , since @xmath60 for large @xmath52 ; however in the limit @xmath61 , which is realized in the peripheral region of each of the two colliding nuclei , equation implies that @xmath18 does not vanish as @xmath52 .",
    "in fact if @xmath62 then from eq .",
    "we get @xmath63 , which implies that @xmath18 is nonzero in this limit , and coincides with the saturation scale of a nucleon  @xcite .    for our simulations of au - au collisions at rhic energy",
    "we take @xmath64 gev@xmath65 , which gives @xmath66 gev in the case @xmath67 , at @xmath68 , @xmath69 gev and @xmath70 , where the average is understood in the transverse plane .",
    "this numerical value is smaller than the one commonly used in hydrodynamic simulations , where @xmath71 gev , see for example  @xcite , and that we used in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we prefer to use a smaller value of the average saturation scale in our simulations because in this way we can shift from the fkln initial condition to the other ones obtaining the same final spectra , without the need to tweak the kinetic freezout parameters when changing among the several initial conditions . in this way ,",
    "the differences between the various systems we study here are confined in the initial configuration , while the dynamics of the freezout is not affected by the initial conditions . however , to show the impact of the saturation scale we will discuss both the cases @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 gev in agreement with the estimates of  @xcite , for the pb - pb collisions simulations at the lhc energy .",

    "in our study we employ transport theory as a base of a simulation code of the fireball expansion created in relativistic heavy - ion collision  @xcite , therefore the gluon distribution function @xmath78 evolves according to the relativistic boltzmann transport ( rbt ) equation : @xmath79~ ,   \\label{eq : be}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 $ ] is the collision integral , @xmath81&=&\\int d\\gamma_2 d\\gamma_{1^\\prime } d\\gamma_{2^\\prime } ( f_{1^\\prime}f_{2^\\prime } - f_1 f_2)\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\times|{\\cal m}|^2\\delta^4(p_1 + p_2 - p_{1^\\prime } - p_{2^\\prime})~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath82 , and @xmath83 corresponds to the transition amplitude .    at variance with the standard use of transport theory , in which one fixes a set of microscopic processes",
    "whose scattering matrix is fed into the collision integral , we have developed an approach that , instead of focusing on specific microscopic calculations or modelings for the scattering matrix , fixes the total cross section in order to have the wanted @xmath0 . by means of this procedure",
    "we are able to use the boltzmann equation to simulate the dynamical evolution of a fluid with specified shear viscosity , in analogy to what is done within hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the advantage of the kinetic theory approach at fixed @xmath0 , compared to hydro simulations , is twofold : firstly starting from @xmath23 , and not from @xmath24 , it is direct to incorporate non - equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "secondly we do not need to specify an ansatz for the deviations @xmath84 from equilibrium due to viscous corrections .",
    "this approach to kinetic theory has been also considered in @xcite where it has been shown that transport theory at fixed @xmath0 reproduces the results of viscous hydrodynamics for one - body observable like @xmath24 or entropy density also in the limit in which the system is not in the dilute regime .",
    "this is not surprising because looking at the boltzmann collision integral in terms of viscosity allows the analytical derivation of second order viscous hydrodynamics @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider only the @xmath85 processes to compute the collision integral .",
    "one may think that the introduction of the higher order processes would result naturally in a change of the available phase space of partons , but once the system is close to an hydro regime where many collisions happens in a very short time respect to the expansion time scale and system size , the detail of the single scattering is lost and what matters is the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "of course one can expect that the microscopic details of the scattering arises at large @xmath3 where a hydro - like description in terms of a gradient expansion of the stress tensor breaks down ; in the regime of small and moderate @xmath3 , which is the one we are interested to in this study , the single collision phase space change is not relevant .",
    "we have indeed checked that we are in a regime where the phase space of the single scatterings are not relevant by changing the microscopic two - body scattering matrix from anisotropic to isotropic , but renormalizing the total cross section in such a way to keep the same @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that leaving unchanged all the other parameters , the elliptic flow is not affected by this change for @xmath86 gev , finding some deviations at larger @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a similar result is seen if @xmath87 collisions are switched on and off once again the cross sections are such to keep @xmath0 fixed @xcite .",
    "once @xmath0 is fixed , we compute the total cross section in each cell of the coordinate space of our grid . to this end",
    "we need an analytical relation between @xmath88 , temperature , cross section and density ; as shown in @xcite , the chapmann - enskog approximation supplies such a relation with quite good approximation , in agreement with the results obtained using the green kubo formula .",
    "therefore , we fix @xmath0 and compute the pertinent total cross section by mean of the relation @xmath89 which is valid for a generic differential cross section @xmath90 as proved in  @xcite . in the above equation @xmath91 , with @xmath92 the screening mass regulating the angular dependence of the cross section , while @xmath93\\ !",

    "the @xmath98 is the proper function accounting for the pertinent relaxation time @xmath99 associated to the shear transport coefficient .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath100 , namely @xmath101 , is reached for isotropic cross section and eq.([eq : sigma ] ) reduces to the relaxation time approximation with @xmath102 ; a smaller value of @xmath98 means that a higher @xmath103 is needed to reproduce the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , we notice that in the regime were viscous hydrodynamic applies ( not too large @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) the specific microscopic detail of the cross section is irrelevant and our approach is an effective way to employ transport theory to simulate a fluid at a given @xmath0 .",

    "moreover we have studied the time scales for the isotropization of the expanding fireball , defining transverse and longitudinal pressures , @xmath153 and @xmath32 respectively , and computing the time evolution of @xmath155 .",
    "we have found that isotropization is not reached if @xmath241 , in agreement with  @xcite ; this result is easily understood , since higher viscosity implies lower cross sections among partons and dynamics in the longitudinal direction and transverse plane are decoupled . on the other hand",
    "it is significant that for a fluid with @xmath242 also isotropization ( @xmath243 ) occurs very quickly @xmath244 .    we have then focused our attention on the elliptic flow production when the initial distribution has a saturation scale built in it .",
    "we have found that the amount of elliptic flow produced in heavy ion collisions depends not only on the pressure gradients and the @xmath0 of the system , but also on the initial distribution in momentum space . in particular ,",
    "an initial condition characterized by a momentum distribution with a saturation scale generates smaller @xmath12 respect to the thermal one .",
    "this result is quite general , and we expect it should be valid , besides qgp in urhics , for systems like cold atoms in a magnetic trap which are characterized by a value of @xmath0 close to the qgp one  @xcite . assuming the fkln distribution as the one arising from the melting of the glasma , the effect of the initial nonequilibrium distribution affects the estimate of @xmath0 of about a factor of two .",
    "however we have seen also that this effect is maximal for semi - peripheral collisions , becoming quite small for very central collisions .",
    "the relevance of our results is further enhanced by the fact that th - fkln with @xmath245 would generate a low @xmath246 respect to the available data .",
    "this is the main conclusion of  @xcite , namely that th - fkln is not able to describe for the experimental observations , might be revised .    in order to make more precise comparison with experimental data we are currently implementing also fluctuating initial conditions which will allow to extend the present study to all the @xmath247 harmonics relevant in hic s",
    "this will allow to see if fkln can account for the measured @xmath246 or the non - equilibrium damps such harmonics even more than what seen in hydrodynamics . in  @xcite it is found that harmonics up to the fifth order can be reproduced by combining cym early - time with hydro late - evolution evolutions ; however in the calculations of  @xcite a small deviation from equilibrium has to be assumed in order to use viscous hydrodynamical equations .",
    "therefore it will be interesting to compute the higher order harmonics combining the cym initial spectrum with the dynamics embedded in the kinetic equations where the assumption of sudden thermalization can be relaxed .",
    "finally , we have also computed the invariant gluon distribution functions , @xmath248 , for the fkln glasma and glauber initial conditions .",
    "we have found that the initial longitudinal expansion strongly affects the evolution of these distributions at early times , causing their lowering of one order of magnitude within 1 fm / c for @xmath249 gev . on then other hand at @xmath250",
    "the longitudinal expansion is compensated by the fast thermalization and even without including @xmath251 enhancement factors @xmath252 stays larger than unity for a time interval @xmath253 .",
    "this suggested that even in the fast expanding qgp in hic a transient bose - einstein condensation can take place as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "however the effect of bose statistics should be relevant at @xmath254 , while our effect is related to the initial non - equilibrium and not to the final exact distribution . in order to verify quantitatively",
    "how this attractor works in presence of the longitudinal expansion we have to perform simulations with bose enhancement factors in the collision integral kernel , which is beyond the scope of the present study but that we will perform in the near future .",

    "<S> in this article we report on our results about the computation of the elliptic flow of the quark - gluon - plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions , simulating the expansion of the fireball by solving the relativistic boltzmann equation for the parton distribution function tuned at a fixed shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our main goal is to put emphasis on the role of a saturation scale in the initial gluon spectrum , which makes the initial distribution far from a thermalized one . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the presence of the saturation scale reduces the efficiency in building - up the elliptic flow , even if the thermalization process is quite fast @xmath1 and the pressure isotropization even faster @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the non - equilibrium implied by the saturation scale manifests for non - central collisions and can modify the estimate of the viscosity respect to the assumption of full thermalization in @xmath3-space . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the estimate of @xmath0 is modified from @xmath4 to @xmath5 at rhic and from @xmath6 to @xmath4 at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we complete our investigation by a study of the thermalization and isotropization times of the fireball for different initial conditions and values of @xmath0 showing how the latter affects both isotropization and thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we have seen that the range of values explored by the phase - space distribution function @xmath7 is such that at @xmath8 the inner part of the fireball stays with occupation number significantly larger than unity despite the fast longitudinal expansion , which might suggest the possibility of the formation of a transient bose - einstein condensate . </S>"
