    "the measured luminosity and half - light radius place madcash  j074238 + 652501-dw upon the observed relationship for lg dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : newdwarf_mv_rh ] ) .",
    "this suggests that even though madcash  j074238 + 652501-dw has evolved in a different environment than mw / m31 dwarfs , the physical processes that determine its properties are similar to those in more massive hosts halos . if madcash  j074238 + 652501-dw also follows other scaling relations for lg dwarf galaxies (",
    "* e.g. , ) , then this dwarf with @xmath60 should have a dynamical mass - to - light ratio of @xmath61 , dynamical mass of @xmath62 , and a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath63 .",
    "this metallicity is consistent with our inference of an overall metal - poor population in madcash  j074238 + 652501-dw .",
    "the sparse cmd precludes a precise quantification of the sfh beyond our previous statement that the galaxy does not host stars significantly younger than 10 gyr .",

    "this source has no obvious counterpart in our hsc images .",
    "using tiles from the _ galex _ all - sky imaging survey , we measure the fuv flux of madcash  j074238 + 652501-dw , using the same aperture and background - subtraction technique used in estimating the optical luminosity in section  [ subsec : lumin ] .",
    "this flux was converted into a luminosity using our adopted trgb distance modulus of 27.65 , adopting an extinction coefficient @xmath65 @xcite .",
