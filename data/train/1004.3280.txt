    "double - beta decay was originally proposed by m. goeppert - mayer in 1935 @xcite as a nuclear disintegration with simultaneous emission of two electrons and two neutrinos : @xmath4    there are four possible double - beta decay processes : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xmath8 , 2@xmath7 and two decay modes : two - neutrino ( 2@xmath1 ) and neutrinoless ( 0@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "2@xmath1-mode is not prohibited by any conservation law and definitely occurs as a second - order process compared to the regular @xmath9-decay .",
    "0@xmath1-mode differs from the 2@xmath1-mode by the fact that no neutrinos are emitted during the decay .",
    "this normally requires that lepton number is not conserved and neutrino should contain a small fraction of massive particles that equals to its anti - particles ( majorana neutrino ) .",
    "obviously , observation of @xmath0(0@xmath1)-decay will have enormous implications on particle physics and fundamental symmetries . while observation of @xmath0(2@xmath1)-decay will provide information on nuclear structure physics that can be used in 0@xmath1-mode calculations @xcite .    experimental evidence and theoretical calculations",
    "indicate that probability for 2@xmath1-mode is much higher than for 0@xmath1-mode .",
    "@xmath10ge @xmath0-decay experiments @xcite have demonstrated that half - life time for @xmath0(2@xmath1)-decay is at least four orders of magnitude lower than @xmath0(0@xmath1 ) . finally , we concentrate here on the experimentally observed 2@xmath1-mode only .",
    "double - beta decay is an important physical process and experimental results , in this field , have been compiled by several groups @xcite .",
    "these compilations were used to produce adopted or recommended values @xcite .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows nndc - recommended values @xcite which were deduced in the accordance with the u.s .",
    "nuclear data program guidelines @xcite .",
    "nndc recommended numbers represent the best available values , further measurements will result in the addition of new and improvements to existing values .",
    ".nndc - recommended @xmath0-decay values .",
    "data are taken from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "@xmath2te data analysis led to observation of @xmath11 energy trend for t@xmath12 recommended values that is consistent with two - nucleon mechanism of @xmath0(2@xmath1)-decay @xcite .",
    "the energy trend and deformation parameters were used to explain nuclear systematics of recommended values and create an empirical rule for 2@xmath9(2@xmath1)-decay half - lives .",
    "the rule has been used to calculate t@xmath12 for all nuclei of interest .",
