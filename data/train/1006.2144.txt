    "at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is widely anticipated that signals of new physics , for example supersymmetry , may manifest themselves as large excesses of data compared to expected qcd and electroweak backgrounds at high momentum scales  @xcite .",
    "the estimation of these backgrounds will be one of the elements in ascertaining the presence of any new physics from such signals .",
    "consequently , considerable effort is being invested across the particle physics community in the development of methods to understand and predict backgrounds ( some of the issues involved are described nicely in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    given the qcd methods that are available today , some of the best prospects for obtaining systematic , accurate predictions of backgrounds involve next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations . by carrying out a systematic expansion in the strong coupling and obtaining the first two terms ( leading order ( lo ) and nlo ) for a given process , one often obtains predictions that are accurate to @xmath2 .",
    "the importance of nlo predictions in the lhc programme has motivated a large calculational effort destined to extend the range of processes known at nlo ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "while the majority of nlo calculations show some degree of convergence relative to the lo results , several groups have commented in recent years on the appearance of @xmath0 factors , ratios of nlo to lo results , that grow dramatically towards high transverse momenta @xcite ( similar behaviour is visible also in @xcite ) .",
    "the problem generally occurs for hadronic observables ( jet transverse momenta , etc . ) in processes that involve heavy vector bosons or heavy quarks , at scales far above the boson or quark mass .     of the hardest jet ( middle ) , and the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all the jets , @xmath3 ( right ) .",
    "the bands correspond to the uncertainty from a simultaneous variation of @xmath4 by a factor of two either side of a default @xmath5{p_{t , j1}^2 + m_{\\mathrm{z}}^2}}$ ] .",

    "it shows the distributions of three observables that are non - zero for configurations involving a z - boson and one or more partons : the transverse - momentum of the z - boson ( @xmath12 ) , the transverse - momentum of the highest-@xmath1 jet ( @xmath13 ) and the effective mass ( scalar sum of the transverse momenta ) of all jets ( @xmath3 ) . at lo ,",
    "all three distributions are identical . at nlo ,",
    "the @xmath12 observable is rather typical of a qcd observable : its distribution has a nlo @xmath0-factor of about @xmath14 , fairly independently of @xmath12 , and its scale dependence is reduced with respect to lo .",
    "the @xmath13 distribution is more unusual : at high @xmath1 it has a @xmath0-factor that grows noticeably with @xmath13 , reaching values of about @xmath15 , which is anomalously large for a qcd correction .",
    "the @xmath3 observable is even more striking , with @xmath0-factors approaching @xmath16 .     + ( a )     + ( b )     + ( c )    given that fig .",
    "[ fig : lo_nlo_dist ] involves momentum scales where @xmath17 , one is driven to ask how it is that such `` giant '' @xmath0-factors can arise . as touched on in @xcite , and discussed in more detail in @xcite for the @xmath13 case , the answer lies in the appearance of diagrams with new kinematic topologies at nlo .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : z+jet - diags ] : at lo the only event topology ( a ) is that of a z - boson recoiling against a quark or gluon jet .",
    "one type of nlo diagram involves gluon radiation from this basic topology , giving modest corrections to all our observables .",
    "however , there are also nlo diagrams ( b , c ) whose topology is that of a dijet event , in which a soft or collinear z - boson is radiated from outgoing or incoming legs .",
    "these diagrams do not contribute significantly to the @xmath12 distribution , because the z - boson carries only a moderate fraction of the total @xmath1 .",
    "however when examining @xmath13 , it is irrelevant whether the z boson is soft or not .",
    "contributions b and c then lead to a result that is of order @xmath18 , where the double logarithm comes from the integration over soft and collinear divergences for z emission .",
    "the ratio of the nlo to lo results is therefore @xmath19 , , and are usually much smaller .",
    "examples do exist of `` giant '' ew effects when tagging flavour @xcite .",
    "] rather than just @xmath20 , hence the @xmath0-factor that grows large with increasing @xmath1 . also comes from the fact that one can have @xmath21 scattering that emits a z , whereas the @xmath22 partonic channel does not contribute at lo .",
    "] for the @xmath3 observable the enhancement is even bigger because the dijet topology leads to @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 at lo .",
    "while it is reassuring that we can understand the physical origins of the large @xmath0-factors in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo_nlo_dist ] , we are still left with doubts as to the accuracy of the nlo z+jet predictions for @xmath13 and @xmath3 , since they are dominated by the lo result for the z+2-parton topologies .",
    "one way forward would be to calculate the full nnlo corrections for the z+jet process .",
    "however , while work is progressing on nnlo calculations of @xmath25 processes with qcd final states ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , results are not yet available ; nor are they likely to become available any time soon for some of the more complex processes where giant @xmath0-factors have been observed ( e.g.  some observables in @xmath26  @xcite ) . alternatively one could simply try to avoid observables like @xmath13 and @xmath3 in inclusive event samples . for example , with additional cuts on the vector - boson momentum or a second jet , refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath0-factors are significantly reduced .",
    "however , given the many analyses that are foreseen at the lhc , it is likely that at least a few will end up probing regions where giant @xmath0-factors are present .    to understand how else one might address the problem of giant @xmath0-factors , one can observe that in our @xmath27 example , the bottleneck in obtaining a nnlo prediction is the inclusion of the two - loop @xmath28 contributions and proper cancellation of all infrared and collinear divergences . yet",
    "the two - loop ( and squared one - loop ) contribution will have the topology of diagram a in fig .",
    "[ fig : z+jet - diags ] and should not be responsible for the dominant part of the nnlo correction , which will instead come from diagrams with the topology of b and c , with either an extra qcd emission or a loop .",
    "so if one includes tree - level @xmath29 and 1-loop @xmath30 diagrams ( i.e.  @xmath31 at nlo ) and supplements them with even a crude approximation to the two - loop @xmath32 result , one that suffices merely to cancel all divergences , then one should have a good approximation to the full nnlo result ( a related observation has been exploited to obtain approximate nnlo results for high-@xmath1 j/@xmath33 production in @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to develop a general method for obtaining such rough estimates of missing loop corrections .",
    "our approach , called loopsim , will be based on unitarity . after explaining how it works in section  [ sec : loopsim - section ] , and outlining a secondary `` reference - observable '' approach for control purposes",
    ", we will test the method by comparing its results to full nnlo predictions for lepton-@xmath1 spectra in drell - yan production in section  [ sec : dy - comparison ] , apply it to our z+jet observables in section  [ sec : results ] and finally , in section  [ sec : qcd ] , examine whether it can be of use even in the absence of giant @xmath0-factors , specifically for a number of dijet observables .",
    "the main ingredient of the loopsim method is a procedure for taking a tree - level event with @xmath34 final state particles and supplementing it with a series of events with @xmath35 particles ( approximate 1-loop events ) , @xmath36 particles ( approximate 2-loop events ) , etc . , such that the sum of the weights of the full set of events is zero .",

    "[ fig : loopsim - diag ] . given a tree - level input event ( a )",
    ", the first step is to interpret it as a sequence of emissions ( as if it had been produced by a parton shower ) , so that for example ( diagram b ) one can view particle 2 as having been emitted from particle 1 , and particle 4 as emitted from the beam .",
    "the attribution of an emission sequence can be performed with the help of a suitable sequential - recombination jet algorithm and will be most meaningful in the limit that emissions are strongly ordered in angle and energy . the next stage is to decide which particles reflect the underlying hard structure of the event . if the event structure at the lowest possible order is that of a @xmath37 scattering , then one should identify two outgoing `` born '' particles .",
    "the born particles will remain present in all the approximate `` loop '' events that are generated .",
    "they are represented as thick red lines in diagram ( c ) .",
    "again this step is most meaningful when all non - born emissions are soft and collinear .",
    "one then generates a set of simulated `` 1-loop '' events by finding all ways of recombining one emitted particle with its emitter , diagrams ( d , e ) .",
    "each such `` 1-loop '' event comes with a relative weight of @xmath38 compared to the tree - level diagram .",
    "similarly the set of simulated `` 2-loop '' events is obtained by finding all ways of recombining two emitted particles with their emitter(s ) ( diagram f ) , each with relative weight @xmath39 ; and so forth down to events where only born particles remain ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsim - diag ] this is already reached at the two - loop level ) .",
    "note that the loop - diagrams drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsim - diag ] are not intended to represent the actual feynman diagrams that would be relevant at 1 and 2-loop level .",
    "instead they indicate the way in which we have approximated the loop divergences , as the unitarising counterparts of the divergences that appear for each emission in the soft and collinear limits .    given the above procedure for unitarising tree - level events",
    ", we shall see that it is then straightforward to extend it to event sets that also include exact loop diagrams .",
    "we start by examining the loopsim procedure in the simple case of purely gluonic tree - level events",
    ". this will suffice to introduce most of the relevant concepts .",
    "section [ sec : loopsim - flavour ] will then discuss some of the additional issues that arise for events with quarks and vector bosons , while the handling of events sets that include exact loop diagrams will be left to section  [ sec : loopsim - nlo ] .",
    "it is helpful to introduce some notation : firstly , @xmath40 is the number of final - state particles present in the lowest relevant order ( i.e.  the number of final - state `` born '' particles ) .",
    "for instance @xmath41 if considering higher - order corrections to dijet events , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsim - diag ] .",
    "@xmath42 represents a generic event with @xmath34 final state particles .",
    "so the starting event of fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsim - diag ] would be labelled @xmath43 .",
    "finally , @xmath44 will be an operator that acts on an event @xmath42 and returns all the events at @xmath45 loops obtained from @xmath42 using the loopsim method .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsim - diag]d , e represents the action of @xmath46 on the input @xmath43 event ( a ) .",
    "the central part of the loopsim method involves the construction of the operator @xmath47 acting on @xmath42 for all @xmath48 ( @xmath49 because the number of real final state particles can not be smaller than that of the lowest order event ) .",
    "recall that the primary function of the loopsim method is to cancel the divergences that appear in the soft and collinear limits . in these limits",
    ", events can be interpreted as stemming from a sequence of probabilistic ( parton - shower ) type @xmath50 splittings of some original hard born particles .",
    "the knowledge of the splitting structure will help us generate loop events to cancel the divergences .",
    "the attribution of a branching sequence is most easily performed using a sequential recombination jet algorithm ( and is inspired by the ckkw matching procedure  @xcite ) .",
    "we will use the cambridge / aachen ( c / a ) algorithm @xcite , which has important advantages over the @xmath6 algorithm when dealing with nested collinear divergences ( avoiding `` junk '' jets @xcite ) .    as a first step , to each of the @xmath51 particles in the event @xmath42 , we assign a unique `` identity '' index @xmath52 .",
    "we then run the cambridge / aachen ( c / a ) algorithm on the event .",
    "it repeatedly clusters the pair of particles that are closest in angle , i.e.  with smallest @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the usual squared angular distance in the @xmath55 plane , and @xmath56 is a free parameter , the loopsim radius .",
    "the c / a algorithm continues until all the @xmath57 , at which point the remaining particles are deemed to cluster with the beam .",
    "an @xmath58 clustering in the c / a algorithm can be reinterpreted as a @xmath59 splitting .",
    "the c / a algorithm does not distinguish in any way between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "however , in the soft limit , say @xmath62 , rather than viewing @xmath63 as splitting to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , it is a better reflection of the divergent structure of the amplitude to view @xmath63 as having emitted a soft gluon @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath60 is nothing other than particle @xmath63 with some small fraction of its energy removed . to account for this , in an @xmath58 clustering , if @xmath64 , then we declare that the `` identity '' @xmath65 of particle @xmath63 should be the same as that of particle @xmath60 , @xmath66 .",
    "also we record @xmath67 as being a `` secondary emitter '' and remember that the object with identity @xmath68 has been emitted from the object with identity @xmath67 .",
    "( exchange @xmath69 if @xmath70 ) .",
    "this is represented in fig .  [",
    "fig : loopsim - diag]b by the fact that particle @xmath71 is a straight line , off which particle @xmath72 has been emitted ; the identity of the @xmath73 combination is @xmath74 . for an @xmath75 clustering , we record @xmath67 as having been emitted from the beam .",
    "the next step in attributing structure to the event is to decide which event particles should be viewed as the born particles , i.e.  which particles are responsible for the hard structure in the event .",
    "inspired by the original formulation of the cambridge algorithm @xcite , for every @xmath76 recombination we assign a @xmath6 algorithm type hardness measure @xmath77  @xcite .",
    ", which however is identical for our default choice of @xmath78 . ] for every beam recombination",
    ", we assign a hardness @xmath79 .",
    "we then work through the recombinations in order of decreasing hardness .",
    "for an @xmath76 recombination ( or @xmath80 splitting ) , assuming @xmath60 is harder than @xmath61 , we mark @xmath81 as a born particle .",
    "if fewer than @xmath40 particles have already been marked as born particle , we also mark @xmath68 as a born particle . for an @xmath75 recombination",
    ", we mark @xmath67 as a born particle .",
    "this is repeated until @xmath40 particles have been marked as born ( a particle may be marked more than once ; in such a case its marking counts only once ) .",
    "as an example , in fig .  [",
    "fig : loopsim - diag ] , the hardest recombination will be between particle @xmath82 and the beam , so particle @xmath82 is marked as a born particle .",
    "the next hardest recombination will that of @xmath83 with the beam",
    ". therefore we mark @xmath84 as a born particle .",
    "this exhausts the number ( @xmath41 ) of born particles that need to be marked .    at the end of the above procedure",
    ", every particle will have been marked as emitted either from the beam or from another particle , and some particles will also have been marked as secondary emitters and/or born particles .",
    "thus in figure  [ fig : loopsim - diag ] , particle @xmath71 is labelled as having been emitted from the beam , it is a secondary emitter and a born particle ; particle @xmath72 is labelled as having been emitted from particle @xmath71 ; particle @xmath82 is a born particle , emitted from the beam ; and particle @xmath85 was emitted from the beam .",
    "the structure that we attribute is of course physically unambiguous only in the presence of strong ordering of emission angles and energies .",
    "however , as we shall argue in section  [ sec : loopsim - expected - accuracy ] , the mistakes that we make for non - ordered configurations should have a small impact for observables with giant @xmath0-factors .",
    "once every particle is labelled in an event @xmath42 , one can compute the result of @xmath86 , which is a set of events @xmath87 .",
    "for an event @xmath42 with respectively @xmath40 born particles and @xmath88 non - born secondary emitters , we define @xmath89 to be the maximum number of particles that will be allowed to become virtual in a given event .",
    "it is obvious that born particles will not become virtual .",
    "additionally , secondary emitters will also not become virtual . to understand why ,",
    "consider the event @xmath90{figs / loopsim - secondary - explanation.eps }    \\end{varwidth}\\ ] ] in which particle @xmath82 is a secondary emitter , since it emitted @xmath85 .",
    "there is a divergence for @xmath85 to be collinear to @xmath82 only if @xmath82 is a final - state particle .",
    "if instead @xmath82 is made virtual , then the divergence for emitting @xmath85 no longer exists ( there is no divergence for emission from internal lines in a diagram ) , so that the weight for the diagram in which @xmath82 is virtual would be the weight of the tree - level diagram times a small coefficient @xmath91 .",
    "this simplest way of accounting for this is to approximate @xmath92 and thus not generate events in which secondary emitters are made virtual ( a more detailed discussion is given in appendix  [ sec : secondary - emitters ] ) .",
    "having understood which particles can be made virtual , the operator @xmath93 , when applied on an event @xmath42 , generates all the @xmath94 diagrams in which @xmath45 particles become virtual . for the virtual events to cancel the infrared and collinear divergences that appear in the tree - level diagram",
    ", we need an infrared and collinear ( irc ) safe procedure to make particles virtual . for instance",
    ", the divergent weight of an event with two collinear partons @xmath60 and @xmath61 has to be cancelled by that of corresponding virtual event ( @xmath61 makes a loop over @xmath60 ) when computing the distribution of any irc safe observable ; and two collinear partons , if not virtualised , have to remain collinear when another particle becomes virtual .",
    "there are two ways for a particle @xmath61 to make a loop :    * if it is labelled as clustering with particle @xmath60 , then one has to spread the momentum of particle @xmath61 over @xmath60 and all the particles that are labelled as clustering with it but which were emitted after @xmath61 according to the c / a clustering sequence ( i.e.  at smaller angle ) .",
    "the exact procedure is explained in detail in appendix  [ app : recoil_procedure ] , and is designed to ensure that the recombination maintains any collinearity properties of non - looped particles and is invariant under longitudinal boosts .",
    "when @xmath61 is the only particle that clusters with @xmath60 , then the procedure becomes equivalent to adding the momenta of particles @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath95 , and then rescaling the momentum @xmath96 such that its mass is set to @xmath97 , while leaving its transverse components @xmath98 , @xmath99 and its rapidity unchanged . *",
    "if particle @xmath61 is labelled as clustering with the beam , then when it is `` looped '' it is simply removed from the event . note that looping particles with the beam is less trivial than it may seem at first sight , because of an interplay with factorisation and the pdfs .",
    "nevertheless it can be shown , appendix  [ sec : incoming - partons ] , that for particle types that are included in the pdfs it does make sense to loop them .",
    "a @xmath1 imbalance will result from the looping of particles with the beam , and so after all loops have been made , we apply a transverse boosts to all remaining event particles , conserving their rapidities , so as to bring the total transverse momentum to zero ( again , see appendix  [ app : recoil_procedure ] ) .",
    "there is some arbitrariness to our procedures for producing physical kinematics in the looped events .",
    "one avenue for future work would be to examine the impact of making different choices .    the operator @xmath100 has the following properties @xmath101 if @xmath102 is the weight of event @xmath42 , then each of the events generated by the @xmath103 operator has a weight @xmath104 once all the @xmath103 have been calculated for @xmath105 , one has to combine them in order to subtract all the soft and collinear divergences that appear in the calculation of @xmath42 and the virtual diagrams generated from it .",
    "this is done by the operator @xmath106 , which is defined as @xmath107 it generates all the necessary looped configurations that have the same order in @xmath108 as the original tree - level diagram .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the total weight of the diagrams obtained from the @xmath106 operator is @xmath97 . indeed ,",
    "if we apply it to an event @xmath42 whose maximum number of virtual particles is @xmath109 , we get @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "we note that the above procedure for approximating loop diagrams does not generate the finite terms needed to cancel the scale - dependence of lower - order diagrams .",
    "while it would be straightforward to include such terms , we believe that in the absence of full loop calculations , not including them helps ensure that the standard procedure of variation of renormalisation and factorisation scales is more likely to provide some form of reasonable estimate of the uncertainties on our results .      in order to illustrate the action of the operator @xmath93 , we give below some simple examples in the pure glue case . in each of these examples",

    "as before we can apply the unitarisation operator to the tree - level events , @xmath150 .",
    "however , since we now include exact 1-loop contributions , @xmath149 , we must remove the approximate 1-loop contributions @xmath151 that are contained in @xmath150 .",
    "this alone is not sufficient , because among the extra contributions from the exact 1-loop terms , there will be pieces that are finite for a given @xmath152-parton configuration , but that can lead to divergences when integrated over the @xmath152-parton phase space . to cancel these extra divergences , we should introduce additional approximate higher - loop contributions , which can be obtained by applying the unitarisation operator @xmath106 to the difference between the exact and approximate one - loop terms .",
    "so , rather than including just events @xmath149 and subtracting @xmath151 , we include events @xmath153 and subtract @xmath154 .",

    "this third jet shifts the @xmath233 distribution to slightly larger values , and because the distribution falls very steeply , that leads to a non - negligible enhancement .",
    "this suggests that if , in section  [ sec : results ] , we had used effective mass observables with at most two objects in the sum , then the @xmath139/nlo ratios would have been close to @xmath71 .",
    "we have verified that this is indeed the case .    the pattern for @xmath259 and @xmath256 in fig .

    "this effect balances out .",
    "in addition , final - state radiation from one of the jets can cause it to shift to lower @xmath1 ( becoming the 2nd jet ) , further reducing the @xmath0-factor for the distribution of @xmath241 .    of the different variables ,",
    "it is only the inclusive jet @xmath1 and @xmath250 for which there is a clear reduction in scale uncertainty in going from lo to nlo .",

    "we are aware of the cumbersome nature of these procedures .",
    "a simplification of them that retained the relevant collinear - safety properties would certainly be of interest .",
    "without going into a full proof , we shall here illustrate why the loopsim method is sensible even in the presence of incoming hadrons , by considering what happens at @xmath139 .",
    "we start with a lo cross section for a process producing @xmath34 hard objects @xmath293 for compactness of notation , we have dropped the @xmath294 dependence in the differential tree - level partonic cross section @xmath295 .",
    "we have also not yet specified our choice for the factorisation scale @xmath296 .",
    "we assume that @xmath297 contains the necessary constraints to relate the incoming partonic momenta to the outgoing momenta .",
    "we further integrate over the phase - space @xmath298 , and include a function @xmath299 , which is @xmath71 if the momenta pass our cuts and @xmath97 otherwise .",
    "we now imagine that there is some transverse - momentum scale @xmath300 below which no radiation is emitted . to @xmath20",
    ", the pdfs @xmath301 can be written in terms of pdfs at scale @xmath300 : @xmath302 where we sum implicitly over repeated indices .",
    "we also define an unregularised splitting function @xmath303 such that @xmath304 , with @xmath305 embodying the virtual parts of the splitting function ( it is zero for @xmath306 ) .",
    "next , we write the lo cross section in terms of a pdf for proton @xmath307 that has been evaluated at scale @xmath300 : @xmath308\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that the first term in round brackets on the second line corresponds to real emission of a parton .",

    "in this limit we also have that @xmath319 ( for @xmath320 ) .",

    "( [ eq : pdf - lo - q0 ] ) , then the second term in square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdf - nlo - end ] ) cancels the first term in round brackets in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdf - lo - q0 ] ) . in other words for initial - state radiation ,",
    "the action of loopsim is not so much to provide virtual corrections as to cancel the real - emission terms already included implicitly through the pdfs in the leading order cross section .",
    "in contrast , the true virtual terms are already included through the pdfs themselves , i.e.  through the second term in round brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdf - lo - q0 ] ) .    as an example , consider @xmath329 . at @xmath330",
    "we will have events such as @xmath331 , where the outgoing quark comes from collinear initial - state splitting @xmath332 , with an underlying hard subprocess @xmath333 . from these events",
    "loopsim will generate a configuration in which the outgoing quark is `` looped '' .",
    "this will come in with a pdf weight that is the product of a gluon distribution and a quark distribution , so it appears that we have a ( negative ) @xmath334 contribution , which would be unphysical .",
    "however in the lo cross section with a factorisation scale @xmath335 , when we write @xmath333 , part of the @xmath336 pdf comes from @xmath337 splitting . if we were just to add the real @xmath331 diagram to the lo cross section alone , then in the collinear limit we would be double counting the part already included in the pdf . with the negative `` @xmath334 '' loopsim contribution ,",
    "what happens is that we simply remove the @xmath336 pdf component , generated from @xmath338 splitting , that was implicitly included at lo with an incorrect final state ( i.e.  lacking an outgoing quark ) , since we are now putting it in with the correct final state through the real @xmath339 diagram .",
    "note that we have not yet worked out the full extension of this discussion to higher orders .",
    "the details would depend on the precise higher orders that we have in mind , for example @xmath139@xmath139versus @xmath139 .",
    "however , regardless of these details , the fundamentally unitary nature of the loopsim procedure is important in ensuring that the simulated `` loops '' simply bring about an overall consistent set of final states while maintaining the total cross section as calculated with a sensible factorisation scale choice .",
    "in section  [ sec : looping - particles ] we discussed the special treatment needed for `` secondary emitters '' , i.e.  non - born particles that have emitted something . in our procedure",
    ", secondary emitters do not get looped : when particle @xmath61 makes a loop over @xmath60 , this is justified by the collinear enhancement of the matrix element due to @xmath60 and @xmath61 being close in angle . but the emission of the same @xmath61 from the configuration where @xmath60 is virtual does not have such a collinear enhancement , so one must not take it into account .",
    "another way to understand it is to consider the example of @xmath72-gluon emission from a @xmath340 dipole .",
    "the squared matrix element for the emission of @xmath72 real energy - ordered ( @xmath341 ) gluons , @xmath342 , @xmath343 , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath344 with      since the @xmath346 term diverges when @xmath343 is collinear to @xmath347 or @xmath348 ( unlike the @xmath349 term ) , it becomes relevant when @xmath343 is considered to have been emitted from @xmath347 or @xmath336 independently of @xmath342 .",
    "the @xmath349 term diverges when @xmath343 is collinear to @xmath342 ( unlike @xmath346 ) , so it becomes relevant when @xmath343 is considered to have been emitted from @xmath342 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_gluons_emission ] , which also shows the virtual corrections ( cf .",
    "one notices that the @xmath349 term only appears when @xmath342 is real .",
    "the diagrams where @xmath342 is virtual are taken into account when @xmath343 is emitted from @xmath347 or @xmath336 .",
    "therefore , @xmath342 can not become virtual when @xmath343 makes a loop over it .",
    "dipole : ( a ) gluons @xmath71 and @xmath72 real ; ( b ) gluon @xmath71 real and @xmath72 virtual ; ( c ) gluon @xmath71 virtual and @xmath72 real ; ( d ) gluons @xmath71 and @xmath72 virtual . in each case , when needed , we use the decomposition into @xmath346 and @xmath349 pieces to separate what can be seen as the emission of gluon @xmath72 from gluon @xmath71 , and what can be seen as the emission of gluon @xmath72 directly from @xmath340 . ]",
