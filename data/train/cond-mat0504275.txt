    "they found that the samples with fe layer thickness of 2   show pure superparamgnetic behavior .",
    "increasing the fe thickness to 4   led to a crossover from superparamagnetic to a mixed ferromagnetic and spin - glass state . the sample with 13   fe layer displays the usual magnetic properties of a gmr multilayer .",

    "the magnetization behavior of thin ( 10 - 50  ) epitaxial fe films on cr studied by berger and hopster @xcite by the magneto - optical kerr effect revealed that the exchange coupling between cr and fe overlayers depends very much on the intrinsic antiferromagnetic properties of cr . at 123 k , cr shows a phase transition from longitudinal spin density wave ( sdw ) to transverse sdw .",
    "our samples are grown on si substrate by ion beam sputter deposition technique using xe ion at 900 v with a beam current of 20 ma and 1100 v with a beam current of 30 ma .",
    "the typical structures are",
    "si / cr(50 )/[fe(20 )/cr(t )]@xmath7 30/cr(50 -t  ) . sample 1 has t = 10   and samples 2 and 3 have t = 12   but they are deposited under different base pressure at 900 v. different base pressure results in different surface roughness .",
    "let us call these samples 1 - 3 , _ series a _ samples .",
    "samples 4 - 8 have t = 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , and 14  ,  respectively and they are sputtered at 1100 v. let us call these samples 4 - 8 , _ series b _ samples .",
    "these samples are well characterised and the details have been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "all the experiments were done with a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer ( mpms ) .",
    "the magnetic field is applied in the plane of the multilayer samples .",
    "samples 1 - 8 have gmr @xmath8 of @xmath9 20 , 21 , 21 , 0.4 , 31 , 33 , 32 , and 29 % , respectively at 4.2 k in a longitudinal magnetic field @xmath9 1 tesla .",
    "ac - magnetization was done using a quantum design ppms with some modifications at forschungszentrum karlsruhe , germany .",
    "when we cool the fe - cr multilayer samples from room temperature to a lower temperature of interest in zero magnetic field and then apply a small magnetic field in the plane of the multilayer , moments in iron layers start responding to this external magnetic field .",
    "those moments of fe layers , which are not aligned in the direction of external field try to align in the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "this gives a finite moment for the whole sample .",
    "good gmr multilayer systems are af in the sense that the fm fe layers are coupled antiferromagnetically in zero field .",
    "when we increase the temperature from the lowest temperature , the thermal energy starts disrupting this nearly perfect af alignment .",
    "thermal fluctuations equally affect both types of fe layers , i.e. , the fe layers with magnetic moments aligned parallel to the applied magnetic field and those with magnetic moments aligned antiparallel to the field",
    ". however , the external magnetic field will try to suppress the fluctuations of moments which are in the direction of the field and will effectively increase the fluctuations of moments which are aligned in the opposite direction . in other words , the decrease in the magnetization due to the thermal energy is less for fe moments parallel to the applied field .",
    "thus the magnetization increases with the increasing temperature .",
    "but when the temperature is beyond a critical value , the thermal energy starts disrupting all the ordered moments thus decreasing the net magnetization with increasing temperature .",
    "so for a small external magnetic field we observe a peak temperature @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1raw ] for sample 1 .",
    "this behavior has been seen prominently in samples 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 and presented in table [ tab : dct ] .",
    "this peak temperature is a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "if we cool the sample in the presence of a small magnetic field , we do not find any peak in m(t ) , rather m increases at lower temperatures ( more ordered state ) .",
    "this feature is similar to the history - dependent effect of spin - glass systems where zero - field cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) magnetization curves follow different paths at low temperatures and low fields .",
    "the motivation behind the present study is to explore such behavior at low fields in these gmr multilayers .",
    "@xmath10 ( which approaches the glass transition temperature @xmath2 when @xmath11 ) decreases with the increasing external magnetic field because a higher magnetic field is able to align the fluctuating moments to their maximum value at lower temperatures . in the high - temperature limit zfc and",
    "fc magnetizations show the same temperature dependence .",
    "a characterstic temperature @xmath0 can be defined below which the sample shows such history dependent effects .",
    "this temperature also decreases with increasing field and @xmath0 is always greater than @xmath10 .",
    "these samples show another characterstic temperature , namely , a point of inflection @xmath12 in fc magnetization vs. t curve .",
    "below this temperature , fc curves are convex upwards and above it they are concave upwards .",
    "thus one more characterstic temperature @xmath12 can be derived apart from @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath12 is found to be independent of the external magnetic field as shown in table [ tab : dct ] .",
    "similar to this work durand et al .",
    "@xcite found different magnetization in fc and zfc measurements in fe - cu multilayers at low temperatures .",
    "they interpreted this phenomena by interdiffusion of fe atoms in cu layers .",
    "they also found a very low value of the saturation magnetization , nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that of bcc fe .",
    "sample 4 did not show any @xmath10 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ox3raw ] .",
    "it has a small cr thickness ( @xmath13 ) of 6   which leads to a fm coupling between the fe layers and not an af coupling .",
    "this fact is supported by a gmr of less than 1 % for this sample .",
    "for the same external magnetic field , it can be seen from table  [ tab : dct ] that @xmath10 shifts to lower temperatures from 75 to 20 k for sample 5 ( @xmath13 = 8  ) to sample 6 ( @xmath13 = 10  ) for an applied field of 50 oe .",
    "this suggests that @xmath10 may be at much lower temperatures for samples 7 and 8 .",
    "our measurement temperature range is 5 to 300 k. sample 7 did not show any peak in a magnetic field of 200 oe , however , in a magnetic field of 50 oe there is a signature of a peak at 8 k ( notice the first 3 - 4 points of zfc curve of sample 7 in fig .  [ fig : ox3raw ] ) .",
    "sample 8 showed a totally different behavior at higher temperatures compared to the other samples in this series as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ox3raw ] . here",
    "the magnetization increases with increasing temperature above 150 k which could not be understood .",
    "if we take the magnetization value ( @xmath14 ) of the samples at the lowest temperature from the zfc magnetization measurements at different applied external magnetic fields , then we find that ( @xmath14 ) is roughly linear with the applied field as in a paramagnet .",
    "this has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm0zfcall ] .    from experimental point of view some major signatures of spin glasses are : ( i ) below @xmath2 spin - glass systems show history - dependent behavior , i.e. , the magnetization measured in a field - cooled condition is different from that under the zero - field - cooled condition @xcite and ( ii ) low field , low frequency ac susceptibility @xmath15 exhibits a cusp at a temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the origin of the spin - glass - like behavior here may be the interface roughness and interdiffused clusters .",
    "these are sputtered samples and the surface roughness may lead to fe - fe , fe - cr and/or cr - cr frustrations @xcite",
    ". there may be fe clusters interdiffused inside cr layers and vice versa . in spin glasses",
    ", @xmath2 is the temperature below which the spins are frozen , i. e. , the fc magnetization curve is flat below @xmath2 .",
    "however , in multilayers , in low fields af cr s role may be quite complex .",
    "bulk cr has a nel temperature @xmath16 = 311 k. nel temperature of cr layers in these multilayers can be very much different from that of the bulk .",
    "it is known that the curie temperature of fe films is less than that of bulk fe . in cr ,",
    "as the thickness decreases , the nel temperature also decreases , either due to the decoupled af state behaving like a thin film , or due to the increasing spin frustration due to closer interfaces . the mechanism of antiferromagnetism in cr",
    "is well explained by spin density wave ( sdw ) @xcite .",
    "below @xmath16 , the sdw is transverse , i.e. , the magnetic moments are perpendicular to the sdw wavevector .",
    "this transverse sdw state shows a transition to longitudinal sdw state at the spin - flip transition temperature @xmath17 = 123 k @xcite .",
    "this adds to the difficulty in understanding the role of cr in the magnetization study of these multilayers .",
    "the magnetization behavior of thin fe films on cr studied by berger et al .",
    "@xcite by magneto - optical kerr effect gave indication that the magnetization in fe layers is oriented in the fe - cr film plane .",
    "in the real case , ion beam sputtered layers may contain atomic steps at surfaces .",
    "these atomic steps cause frustration while aligning the magnetic moments at the interface .",
    "figure 5 of ref . and fig . 3 of ref .",
    "give beautiful illustrations of different atomic interface situations .",
    "in summary , we can say that in these measurements we get contributions from many sub - systems like fm fe films , af cr films which show sdw transition at @xmath9 123 k ( below this temperature cr may lead to the formation of small domains in fe films ) , and sg - like interdiffused clusters , spin waves , etc .",
    "the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between two successive fe layers decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "most of the theories assume that the coupling involves only those few atomic layers in the fm which are nearest to the interfaces@xcite .",
    "experiments introducing other fm materials at the interfaces have confirmed this point of view to some extent .",
    "each fm layer can be divided into  bulk \" and  surface \" regions consisting of superparamagnetic and/or spin - glass particles / clusters , etc .. we find that the fc magnetization data of our multilayers fit well to the power law of the form      where a is a constant of proportionality .",
    "the values of @xmath19 are consistent with the experimental resolution .",
    "the values of @xmath20(correlation coefficient),@xmath21 and a are presented in table [ tab : pwr ] .",
    "the typical fits are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3by2 ] .",
    "the proportionality constant a , which is analogous to the the spin - wave stiffness constant in bloch s @xmath1 law , depends on the magnetization .",
    "we have earlier done magnetization measurements ( above h@xmath22 where all fe layers are aligned in fm configuration ) with temperature in these multilayers @xcite .",
    "we fitted the data to bloch s @xmath1 law .",
    "we found that the values of a are of the order of @xmath23 k@xmath24 .",
    "in low fields , on the other hand , a is 30 times more compared to the above value .",
    "to explain this we have to consider the behavior of fe clusters in cr layers .",
    "it has been found by vega et al .",
    "@xcite that fe@xmath25 ( @xmath26 = number of fe atoms in fe clusters ) clusters can behave as a fm or an af .",
    "the magnetic order within the fe and cr slabs is qualitatively the same as in the corresponding pure solids and that the coupling at the interfaces is usually af . they found strong environment dependence of the local magnetic moments .",
    "the fe moments at the interface are reduced with respect to the bulk value , while in the middle of the slab they are sometimes enhanced .",
    "the cr moments are not only modified close to the interface , but they are extremely sensitive to the compatibility of their spin density wave ( sdw ) state and the af coupling at the fe - cr interface .",
    "they have calculated that small fe@xmath25 clusters in cr order af as the cr matrix for @xmath27 . for larger",
    "fe@xmath28 , the magnetic order within the fe cluster is fm - like .",
    "so ` a ' value will depend on the behavior of these fe clusters .",
    "large values of a will give small spin - wave stiffness constant .",
    "similar results were found by de oliveira et al . on fe - cu multilayers .",
    "sample 4 gives good fit to eq .",
    "[ eq : pwr ] for the whole temperature range and in both zfc and fc cases . here",
    "the value of the coefficient a is close to that given in ref . .",
    "this means that the magnetization behavior of sample 4 even in low fields is more like the magnetization behavior of multilayers in the presence of magnetic filed greater than saturation field .",
    "above @xmath0 the magnetization decreases as 1/t in these multilayers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : onebyt ] . at high temperature",
    "the thermal energy disrupts all magnetic alignments .",
    "similar studies of low - field magnetization in ion - beam deposited metal - insulator @xmath29 multilayers were carried out by kakazei et al .",
    "they also reported that the low - field magnetization curve m(h , t ) generally displays the curie - weiss behavior at high temperatures and below a certain blocking temperature the fc - zfc curves split .",
    "figure [ fig : onebyt ] shows the typical fits to @xmath30 .",
    "we found that the @xmath31 .",
    "we have taken the data only above @xmath0 for the above analysis .",
    "now we proceed to find out the external field dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "we find that the de almeida and thouless ( at ) behavior of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath2 is the spin - glass temperature , gives an unique @xmath2 for each sample which is @xmath33 of that sample .",
    "[ fig : at ] shows the plots of @xmath10 vs. @xmath34 for samples 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "@xmath2 is the intercept of the best - fitted straight line with the @xmath10-axis , i.e. , @xmath35 when @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath2 is also pronounced in @xmath36 measurements , i.e. , we got a peak in ac - magnetization measurements at roughly the same temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2ac ] and discussed in subsection  [ ss : acm ] .",
    "m - h measurements of these samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh ] .",
    "all the samples except 4 show typical hysteresis of af coupled multilayers . from these measurements",
    "we are able to extract the following important information :    1 .",
    "_ b series _ samples have better antiferromagnetic coupling ( except sample 4 ) between fe layers compared to _ a series _ samples .",
    "we have made a comparison between samples according to their remanent to saturation magnetization ratio @xmath37 .",
    "we define a quantity called the antiferromagnetic fraction(aff ) as + @xmath38 + samples 1 , 2 , and 3 have aff @xmath9 80 % at 5 k. sample 4 , which has @xmath39 1 % gmr at 5 k has fm alignment of fe layers even in zero applied magnetic field , has the least aff @xmath9 50 % .",
    "samples 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 have aff @xmath9 95 % at 10 k. this gives us an important information about the coupling of fe layers .",
    "fe layers in samples 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 are coupled antiferromagnetically better than samples 1 , 2 , and 3 in zero field .",
    "samples 1 , 2 , and 3 have more interface roughness compared to sample 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ( concluded from the fact that samples 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 have less residual resistivity ( @xmath9 30 @xmath40 cm ) compared to samples 1 , 2 , and 3 ( @xmath9 45 @xmath40 cm ) . the saturation field for _ a series _ samples is about 1.3 tesla but the saturation fields for for _ b series _ samples decreases gradually from 1.2 to 0.5 tesla .",
    "this implies that the strength of coupling in _",
    "a series _ samples is stronger than _ b series _ samples . for _ a series _",
    "samples the coercive field is about 200 oe at 10 k. the coercive field of samples 5 - 8 is about 70 oe .",
    "this lower value of the coercive field indicates that samples 5 - 8 have `` cleaner '' interfaces , i. e. , in the absence of a field or in small fields the fe layers are aligned `` perfectly '' af . samples 1 , 2 , and 3 have `` rougher '' interfaces and there are more fe cluster embedded in cr layer and vice versa .",
    "probably this is one of the reasons why the history - dependent behavior was more prominently seen in samples 1 - 3 .",
    "the mbe grown samples , however , have never shown any hysteresis effect due to their much smoother interfaces .",
    "the magnetization data with external applied magnetic field at room temperature fit well to the langevin function of the form @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the average magnetic moment of the clusters , n is the number of clusters in the sample and @xmath43 is the amplitude of the superparamagnetic contribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : lang ] shows the langevin function fit for samples 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 below saturation field .",
    "the average magnetic moment per superparamagnetic cluster @xmath42 in bohr magnetons have been found @xmath44 and @xmath45 for samples 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 , respectively .",
    "this gives an indication that the average interdiffused particle volume is about the same in both the series and history dependent behaviour is affected prominently by interface heterostructure .",
    "we did not get langevin function fit for sample 8 which has the least saturation field of about half a tesla . here , the exchange coupling between successive fe layers are weak but the interdiffused clusters are strongly coupled to the nearby fe layers .",
    "we have measured the ac - magnetization vs. temperature in these multilayers at different frequencies of an ac field of 10 oe .",
    "we have found that the ac - magnetization has peaks as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2ac ] for sample 2 . as the signals are quite low ( micro - gram of fe in these samples ) we got rather noisy data . here",
    "the peaks in the ac - magnetization show a temperature shift , although by a very small amount ( as in spin glasses ) , when we change the frequency of the driving signal . for comparison , a quantitative measure of the frequency shift in terms of @xmath46 per decade of @xmath47 in canonical spin - glass is @xmath48mn ( 0.5 % ) , @xmath49mn ( 0.45 % ) , and @xmath50mn ( 0.6 % )  @xcite . for the insulating spin glasses the frequency dependence is larger .",
    "it is much more in superparamagnets like @xmath51 ( 6 % ) and @xmath52 ( 28 % ) .",
    "spin glasses show cusp - like behavior at @xmath2 . the cusp gets smeared even at fields only as high as 50 oe . in our measurements we found only rounded peaks .",
    "the peak shifts to higher temperatures as we increase the frequency .",
    "to analyse this data we did peak fitting to each data set . from this peak fit",
    "we are able to observe clearly that the peak shifts toward higher temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tg ] and the magnitude of the magnetization decreases with increasing frequency . to interpret this result",
    "we assume the presence of clusters of different volumes ( giving rise to a distribution of moments ) at the interfaces and/or interdiffused in the bulk . at lower frequency moments of all size",
    "will be able to follow the magnetic field while at larger frequencies only small moments will be following the external field and the large clusters ( large moments ) will not be able to respond .",
    "this explains the larger magnitude of magnetization for lower frequency .",
    "any peak is a competition of two processes . at the lowest temperature",
    "the moments are frozen but as we start raising the temperature the thermal energy gives them some freedom to move and we get higher magnetization with increasing temperature . above a certain temperature",
    "there is no freezing and we get a maximum .",
    "further increase in the thermal energy disrupts all the alignments and so the moment starts falling .",
    "clusters of smaller size are unlocked at lower temperatures compared to those having large moments .",
    "the arrhenius law to explain the frequency shift in superparamagnets is given by @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath47 is the driving frequency of @xmath36 measurements , @xmath54 is the energy barrier height ( = @xmath55 , the anisotropy constant times the cluster volume ) , and @xmath2 is the peak temperature . if the volume of clusters is fixed , then @xmath2 increases with increasing frequency . however , if there is a cluster volume distribution , then at higher frequency only smaller clusters respond and so the peak temperature shifts towards lower temperatures with increasing frequency . in multilayers , @xmath2 is shifting towards higher temperatures with increasing frequency .",
    "this suggests that the change in @xmath2 due to cluster volume change is small in the present investigation .    to conclude ,",
