    "<S> ( ii ) for very elastic particles e.g. for foams , emulsions or glassy lennard jones phases , the dynamics in the quasi - static regime is controlled by elasto - plastic events  @xcite : when sheared , energy is slowly stored and rapidly released through scale - free avalanches , in close analogy with the depinning transition of an elastic line . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have suggested that an assembly of rigid particles could similarly present an intermittent succession of plastic events localized in space and time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the third picture is based on an analogy with eyring s transition state theory for the viscosity of liquids @xcite , where mechanical fluctuations would play the role of temperature in thermal systems . </S>",
    "<S> each plastic rearrangement is assumed to generate at random a new realization of the forces on the contact network , allowing for the formation of new weak zones where the next rearrangement will occur . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we will test successively these three pictures using discrete element simulations .    _ </S>",

    "<S> , the normal stress @xmath9 is increased gradually in two thin boundary layers located close to the walls ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) and reaches a constant value @xmath10 in the bulk ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the yield parameter @xmath11 based on the shear stress @xmath0 , which is kept homogeneous across the cell , and on the dynamical friction coefficient @xmath12 is the central control parameter ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the whole system ( the boundary layers and the bulk ) constitutes a single continuous liquid phase . from the jamming perspective , the flow in the bulk , observed when the stress is lower than the yield stress , results from a lack of coordination in the contact network . </S>",
    "<S> particles are expected to move cooperatively along floppy modes whose characteristic size diverges at the jamming point . </S>",
