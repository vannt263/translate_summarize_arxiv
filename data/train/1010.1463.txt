    "the number of light scattering events ( in time per unit volume ) in the direction parallel to the magnetic field from the initial into the final state is given by the probability of scattering @xmath127 from @xmath128 into @xmath129 and the initial manganese states @xmath116 distribution function @xmath130 in magnetic field under excitation with @xmath114 polarized light .",
    "@xmath131 the dependence of @xmath130 from excitation light helicity @xmath114 is especially important .",
    "it takes into account possible optical orientation of manganese ions .",
    "since the spin - flip is detected at the energy @xmath132 in the final state of the crystal there is only manganese spin , which is flipped , while all other lattice variables are fixed .",
    "therefore the probabilities for back and forward transitions are equal to each other @xmath133 if the spectral width of spin - flip resonance profile is larger than the zeeman splitting of manganese spin sublevels , then the transition probability weakly depends on the light frequency @xmath134 .",
    "such kind of situation is realized in gaas : mn with @xmath135  @xmath3 .",

    "it follows that the eq .",
    "( 1 ) does not contain probability @xmath157 .",
    "it is also seen that the asymmetry parameter is proportional to the scattering order @xmath30 .",
    "( 1 ) is deduced for the identical positions of polarizer and analyzer . in case",
    "if they are crossed the probabilities of the transitions become important and the difference in intensities of stokes and anti - stokes components may take place even without manganese polarization .",
    "for example , @xmath20-photon creates the exciton with momentum projection @xmath158 and after interaction with manganese it transforms into the state with @xmath159 and subsequently emits a @xmath21-photon .",
    "simultaneously the manganese momentum projection increases by 2 so that photon frequency is shifted into the stokes region .",
    "the anti - stokes component for such scattering process does not exist at all .",
    "however this is related to selection rules and not to manganese polarization . in order to find the manganese polarization in case of crossed polarizer and analyzer",
    "it is necessary to compare the intensity of stokes component in @xmath160 configuration with the intensity of anti - stokes component in the opposite @xmath161 configuration , which is not always convenient from experimental point of view .",
    "we emphasize that for @xmath162 the eq .",

    "it is not valid if there are two ions in the exciton localization region and each of these ions flips its spin resulting in the total projection change of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the sample should be doped in a such way that the average number of mn@xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) ions in the exciton localization volume is below 1 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of gaas doped with mn .",
    "the main part of manganese are bound with the holes forming the neutral magnetic acceptor with the total spin @xmath163 .",

    "there are 2 - 3 of such acceptors , which allows the combined spin - flip processes .                here",

    "excitation of the energetically close lying @xmath171 complex does not influence the sfrs signal on the ionized manganese @xmath172 since the exciton bound to a neutral acceptor @xmath169 is localized far enough from a neighboring @xmath172 ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 is the donor bohr radius ) .",
