    "mitigating the effect of decoherence is an important problem in the emerging area of quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite and other quantum - based technologies @xcite . dynamical decoupling ( dd )",
    "is a promising tool for this task @xcite .",
    "originating from the ideas that underlie the spin echo effect in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , dd employs a specially designed sequence of control pulses applied to the qubits ( or the central spins ) in order to negate the coupling of the central spins to their environment .",
    "a variety of dd protocols have been developed , analyzed , and employed for a few decades in the area of high - resolution nmr @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested later that the decoupling property of these protocols can be used for more general purpose of suppressing decoherence and achieving high - fidelity quantum operations , thus giving rise to extensive theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigation of various novel aspects of dd in the qip context .",
    "since dd requires no feedback and no ancilla resources , and is applicable to a wide range of systems , it presents a promising tool for lowering the number of quantum errors beyond the error correction threshold @xcite .",
    "performance analysis of the decoupling protocols is often based on the magnus expansion ( me ) @xcite , which is an asymptotic cumulant expansion of the evolution operator of the system , with the characteristic inter - pulse delay ( or duration of a single dd cycle , for periodic sequences ) playing the role of the small expansion parameter . by designing the protocols which nullify more and more expansion terms",
    ", one expects that in favorable experimental situations the decoupling fidelity increases .",
    "an example of the first - order decoupling protocol is a very basic periodic dynamical decoupling ( pdd ) sequence @xcite , which consists of repeating the basic cycle @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the free evolution of the system , and @xmath2 denotes a 180@xmath3 spin rotation around e.g.  @xmath4-axis ( all analysis here and below is performed in the rotating frame , i.e.  in the coordinate frame rotating around the @xmath5-axis with the larmor precession frequency @xcite ) .",
    "this sequence works for the ising - type coupling , for instance , when a central spin is coupled to the decohering bath via the term @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the @xmath5-component of the central spin and @xmath8 is the bath operator .",
    "such terms lead to pure dephasing of the central spins in the @xmath4-@xmath9 plane , i.e.  only transverse components of the central spins are affected by the bath . in order to eliminate more general type of coupling , involving decoherence of all components of the central spin ,",
    "a two - axis control is needed , when the 180@xmath3 rotation axes alternate between @xmath4 and @xmath9 directions @xcite , so the basic period of the pdd sequence has a form @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 denoting the @xmath2 rotations around @xmath4 and @xmath9 , respectively . to increase the decoupling order , eliminating the second - order me terms as well , we need to use more advanced sequences than pdd .",
    "one possibility is to use symmetrized sequences ( sdd ) @xcite having a twice longer cycle , consisting of the pdd cycle followed by its mirror image . another approach to achieve higher - order decoupling is to use concatenated dd ( cdd ) protocol , which removes the system - bath coupling terms in the me up to the @xmath13-th order by nesting the pdd sequence recursively to itself @xmath13 times.@xcite the number of pulses in cdd increases exponentially with the concatenation level , approximately as @xmath14 . within cdd approach , the total decoupling time",
    "can be increased either by increasing the concatenation order , or by periodically repeating the fixed - level cdd protocol .    another way to improve",
    "the decoupling fidelity is to optimize positions of the pulses , thus creating a family of aperiodic sequences where the inter - pulse delays are not necessarily commensurate . in ref .",
    "g.  s.  uhrig proposed a sequence ( later abbreviated as udd ) , where optimization of the pulse positions provides @xmath13-th order decoupling using @xmath13 pulses @xcite .",
    "udd has been implemented and tested experimentally in different systems @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that udd is optimal when the noise spectrum of the bath has a sharp high - frequency cutoff @xcite , while for the spectra with soft cutoffs the protocols with periodic structure , such as the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill @xcite ( cpmg ) sequence , perform better @xcite .",
    "while udd employs a single - axis control , and therefore suppresses only pure dephasing , several udd - based aperiodic protocols were developed to suppress general decoherence by incorporating double - axis controls , including the concatenated version of udd ( cudd ) @xcite , and quadratic dd ( qdd ) where two udd sequences based on spin rotations about perpendicular axes are nested into each other @xcite . in cudd",
    ", the number of pulses also grows exponentially but slower than cdd , and in qdd the pulse number required to suppress @xmath13-order decoherence is of order of @xmath15 .",
    "while dd protocols are usually designed based on the assumption of ideal pulses , in reality the accumulation of small imperfections of the pulses can severely affect the decoupling fidelity and even qualitatively change the evolution of the central spins .",
    "the influence of the pulse errors on the dd protocols has been studied from early days of nmr @xcite within the me ( or me - like ) settings , by considering the pulse errors as extra terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , such an approach is not always satisfactory .",
    "first , the convergence conditions of me are not always satisfied in the experiments , although the dd may still efficiently suppresses decoherence .",
    "second , due to its asymptotic nature , the me can miss the possibility of disastrous pulse error accumulation at long times , when the number of pulses becomes very large .",
    "very detailed studies of the errors introduced by the finite pulse width have been performed for cdd @xcite and udd @xcite .",
    "the experimental study of the systematic errors in the rotation axis and angle has been done for a number of periodic protocols and for udd @xcite , and both error types ( finite - width and systematic ) have been discussed for dynamically corrected gates @xcite .",
    "the theoretical - experimental investigation of the long - term accumulation of the systematic pulse errors has been done for several periodic - based protocols , pdd , sdd , and cdd @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present a theoretical analysis of the aperiodic protocols , udd and qdd , focusing on the long - term accumulation of the systematic pulse errors .",
    "these errors can be much more devastating than the imperfections associated with the finite width of the pulses .",
    "we use numerical modeling to analyze the situation when the aperiodic protocols with imperfect pulses are used for decoupling of the electron spins of the phosphorus donors in silicon .",
    "this system may present a promising platform for scalable solid - state quantum information processing , and is a good testbed for studying a number of fundamental issues in quantum dynamics and quantum control of solid - state spins @xcite .",
    "the si : p system is well characterized @xcite , dd of the electron spins of p donors is efficiently implemented via pulsed esr technique , and the realistic pulse error parameters have been estimated earlier @xcite . comparing the results of our study below with the previous works on periodic protocols in the same system , we find that the aperiodic sequences provide reasonable decoupling fidelity , but they are more demanding to the pulse error magnitude than e.g.  cdd . we also demonstrate that , by choosing a right set of two - axis controls , the effect of the pulse errors can be significantly reduced , and explain the reason behind this improvement .",
    "it is interesting that the right choice for qdd protocol , employing rotations around the @xmath5 and @xmath9 axes , is a bad choice for cdd and pdd , where the rotations around @xmath4 and @xmath9 should be used @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates again that the analysis of the pulse error accumulation is , in general , protocol - specific .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] , we describe the si : p system and present a model for the pulse errors . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the electron spins of p donors in silicon have long relaxation and coherence times @xcite , and have been used earlier to explore fundamental aspects of quantum spin dynamics and dd @xcite . in this study , we consider the same experimental situation as described in ref .  .",
    "the sample is an isotopically purified bulk silicon with @xmath16si concentration @xmath17ppm , and very low doping density of phosphorus , so that the coupling between different p donor spins can be neglected at the relevant timescales .",
    "a large static ( quantizing ) magnetic field is applied along the @xmath5-axis to the system , and the temperature is sufficiently low ( @xmath18k in the experiments reported in ref .  ) .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath19 of the p electron spin is very long , so the longitudinal relaxation is neglected here .",
    "similarly , the coherence time @xmath20 , defined as the spin echo decay time , is long ( several milliseconds , limited by instantaneous diffusion ) and will also be neglected below @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider only pure dephasing of the p electron spins .",
    "one important dephasing channel is the ising - type hyperfine coupling to the @xmath16si nuclear spins @xcite . due to rather large localization radius of the p donor electron in silicon , the p electron spin couples to a large number ( bath ) of @xmath16si nuclear spins . for an isotopically purified sample considered here ,",
    "the interactions between different @xmath16si nuclear spins are small and can be neglected , so we are dealing with the static nuclear spin bath . moreover , since the p donors are well separated , the @xmath16si nuclei which are appreciably coupled to one p electron spin interact very weakly with other donor centers , so each donor can be considered as a separate central spin with its own static spin bath . another important contribution to dephasing",
    "is the inhomogeneous broadening due to quasistatic fluctuations of the quantizing magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in the frame rotating with the frequency at the center of the esr line of the p electrons , the hamiltonian for a p electron spin coupled to the bath is @xmath21 where @xmath7 is the @xmath5-component of the electron spin operator , and @xmath8 is the total random static offset field created by the bath of @xmath16si nuclei and the fluctuations of the external field @xcite .",
    "experiments show that the esr lineshape is gaussian with the width of 50  mg , so that the distribution function of @xmath8 is @xmath22}\\ ] ] with @xmath23  mg .",
    "note however , that our results are not very sensitive to the specific shape of the distribution .",
    "the hyperfine coupling of the p electron to the donor s own @xmath24p nuclear spin ( @xmath25 ) is large @xcite , of order of 100  mhz , so that the two hyperfine lines are well separated , and we assume that only one line is excited . then the on - site hyperfine coupling to @xmath24p nucleus just shifts the esr frequency , and we neglect this interaction .    as is standard in nmr and esr ,",
    "the experimental temperature is much larger than the zeeman energy of the electron spins in the quantizing field .",
    "thus , we describe the state of a p spin within the high - temperature approximation , as is customarily done in nmr / esr theory @xcite , using the density matrix @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is small .",
    "since the @xmath19 time is extremely large , and the identity matrix is not affected by the unital evolution , we can neglect it , and consider the electron spin as being in a pure state with @xmath28 ( so - called pseudo - pure state ) .",
    "other initial ( pseudo)pure states , e.g.  along the @xmath4 and @xmath9 axes , can be prepared by the @xmath29 pulses applied along the @xmath9 and @xmath30 axes , respectively . for pure initial states performance of the decoupling",
    "can be conveniently quantified by the input - output fidelity , i.e.  by the overlap between the initial and the final ( reduced ) density matrices of the system . by virtue of the relation",
    "@xmath31 , the average spin projections @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 can be equivalently used as measures of the decoupling performance . note that the angular brackets here denote both quantum - mechanical averaging ( including trace over the bath states ) and the averaging over the ensemble of different p electron spins .",
    "below , we use the rescaled fidelity , which for the initial state along the axis @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 .      for the experimental situation under consideration",
    "the systematic errors in the pulse parameters ( rotation angle and the direction of the rotation axis ) are much larger than the errors associated with the finite pulse width .",
    "therefore , we treat each @xmath2-pulse as an instantaneous but imperfect spin rotation . for a nominal @xmath2-pulse about the @xmath4 axis ( the @xmath11 pulse )",
    "the unitary operator describing the spin evolution is @xmath37}\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the error in the rotation angle , and @xmath39 is the unit vector along the rotation axis , where the small parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 characterize the deviation of the actual rotation axis from the @xmath4 axis .",

    "equal to 11  @xmath49s ) .    to model the systematic errors , we take into account that the resonant ac field @xmath50 , which rotates the spins during pulses , is not homogeneous over the sample .",
    "we assume for simplicity that this field varies only along one spatial axis , denoted as @xmath51 , and the sample is located between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we also assume that the sample is placed optimally with respect to the field , with the sample center @xmath54 located at the maximum of @xmath50",
    ". then the spatial dependence of @xmath50 has a form @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath56 is the average magnitude of the ac field over the sample and @xmath57 characterizes the ac field inhomogeneity .",
    "if the pulse width @xmath58 is adjusted to give @xmath59 , then the spins located at different parts of sample will undergo rotation by different angles . for @xmath11 pulse",
    ", the resulting rotation angle errors @xmath38 will have distribution @xmath60^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 characterizes the magnitude of the rotation angle errors . in a similar way",
    ", we assume that the @xmath5-component of the rotation axis @xmath41 has the same distribution , and its magnitude is characterized by the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "we also assume that the pulse errors for @xmath64 and @xmath65 pulses are the same , taking @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the pulse error parameters @xmath45 and @xmath40 have different nature : they characterize the phase of the pulse , and can be adjusted very precisely , so we assume them to be zero , following refs .  .",
