    "relativistic nucleus - nucleus ( ) collisions are expected to produce a deconfined state of qcd matter  the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  at high enough densities or temperatures .",
    "the  meson should be  @xcite sensitive to hot and dense matter ( hdm ) effects , through processes like the colour debye screening of the  pair .",
    "a significant suppression of the  yield was observed at sps energy by the na50  experiment  @xcite , and at rhic by the phenix experiment in  @xcite and  @xcite collisions at @xmath1 .",
    "the data recently taken at lhc in pbpb collisions at @xmath2 will provide results at a new energy scale , providing means to further test the available models .",
    "however , concurrent mechanisms  the cold nuclear matter  ( cnm ) effects  are known to already impact the  production in proton  ( deuteron)-nucleus (  or ) collisions , where the deconfinement can not be reached .",
    "hence , the interpretation of the results obtained in  collisions relies on a good understanding and a proper subtraction of the cnm effects .",
    "two cnm effects are of particular importance  @xcite : ( i ) the shadowing of the initial parton distributions ( pdfs ) due to the nuclear environment , and ( ii ) the breakup of  pairs after multiple scatterings with the remnants of the incident nuclei , referred to as the nuclear absorption . in our previous works",
    "@xcite , we developed an exhaustive study of these effects .",
    "we confronted our results to the measurements from phenix  @xcite in  collisions at @xmath1 , before giving our cnm effects estimates in  and  collisions .",
    "it is our purpose here to extend our results to  and pbpb collisions at the current lhc energy @xmath2 .    as we have shown in earlier studies  @xcite , considering the adequate  partonic production mechanism",
    " either via a or a process  affects both the way to compute the nuclear shadowing and its expected impact on the  production .",
    "from now on , we will refer to the former scenario as the _ intrinsic _ scheme , and to the latter as the _ extrinsic _ scheme .",
    "most studies on the  production in hadronic collisions are carried out in the intrinsic scheme .",
    "they rely on the assumption that the  pair is produced by the fusion of two gluons carrying some intrinsic transverse momentum  .",
    "the partonic process being a scattering , the sum of the gluon intrinsic  is transferred to the  pair , thus to the  since the soft hadronisation process does not alter significantly the kinematics .",
    "this is supported by the picture of the colour evaporation model ( cem ) at lo ( see  @xcite and references therein ) or of the colour - octet ( co ) mechanism at @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "thus , in such approaches , the transverse momentum  of the  _ entirely _ comes from the intrinsic  of the initial gluons .",
    "however , the average value of  is not expected to go much beyond @xmath4 .",
    "so this process is not sufficient to describe the  spectrum of quarkonia in hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent theoretical works incorporating qcd corrections or @xmath5-channel cut contributions have emphasized   that the colour - singlet ( cs ) mediated contributions are sufficient to describe the experimental data for hadroproduction of both charmonium and bottomonium systems without the need of co contributions .",
    "furthermore , recent works  @xcite focusing on production at @xmath6 colliders have posed stringent constraints on the size of co contributions , which are the precise ones supporting a hadroproduction mechanism  @xcite . as a consequence ,  production at low and mid  likely proceeds via a process , such as @xmath0 , instead of a process above @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of more partons in the final state is to increase the difference between the results obtained in both schemes .",
    "however the implementation of nlo and nnlo codes in a glauber model with an inhomogeneous shadowing is not yet available . ] .",
    "this amounts to the bulk of the  production cross section .",
    "consequently , one is entitled to consider that the former kinematics i.e.  the extrinsic scheme is the most appropriate to derive cnm effects at rhic , and to provide predictions at lhc energy . in this work",
    ", we shall focus on the cnm effects expected at the current lhc energy @xmath2 in the extrinsic scheme .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : approach ] , we will describe our model and in section  [ sec : results ] , we will present and discuss our results .",
    "to describe the  production in nuclear collisions , our monte  carlo framework  @xcite is based on the probabilistic glauber model .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section at @xmath2 is taken to be @xmath8  @xcite and the maximum nucleon density to be @xmath9 .",
    "we also need to implement the partonic process for the  production model that allows to describe the  data , and the cnm effects .      for @xmath10",
    ", most of the transverse momentum of the quarkonia should have an extrinsic origin , _ i.e. _  the s  would be balanced by the emission of a recoiling particle  a hard gluon  in the final state .",
    "the  would then be produced by gluon fusion in a process .",
    "this emission , which is anyhow mandatory to conserve @xmath11-parity , has a definite influence on the kinematics of the  production . indeed , for a given  momentum ( thus for fixed rapidity  @xmath12 and )",
    ", the processes discussed above , _ i.e. _  the intrinsic @xmath13 and the extrinsic @xmath14 , will proceed on the average from initial gluons with different bjorken-@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , they will be affected by different shadowing corrections .    in the intrinsic scheme ,",
    "the measurement of the  momentum in  collisions completely fixes the longitudinal momentum fraction of the initial partons : @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the  mass . on the contrary , in the extrinsic scheme",
    ", the knowledge of the @xmath12 and  spectra is not sufficient to determine @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "actually , the presence of a final - state gluon introduces further degrees of freedom , allowing several @xmath21 for a given set @xmath22 .",
    "the four - momentum conservation results in a complex expression of @xmath20 as a function of  @xmath23 : @xmath24 equivalently , a similar expression can be written for @xmath19 as a function of  @xmath25 . even if the kinematics determines the physical phase space ,",
    "models are anyhow _ mandatory _ to compute the proper weighting of each kinematically allowed @xmath21 .",
    "this weight is simply the differential cross section at the partonic level times the gluon pdfs , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath26 . in the present implementation of our code",
    ", we are able to use the partonic differential cross section computed from _ any _ theoretical approach . in this work",
    ", we shall use the colour - singlet model ( csm ) at lo at lhc energy , shown to be compatible  @xcite with the magnitude of the -integrated cross - section as given by the phenix  data  @xcite , the cdf @xmath27 data  @xcite and the lhc  data at @xmath28 .      to obtain the  yield in  and   collisions ,",
    "a shadowing - correction factor has to be applied to the  yield obtained from the simple superposition of the equivalent number of  collisions .",
    "this shadowing factor can be expressed in terms of the ratios @xmath29 of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdf ) in a nucleon belonging to a nucleus  @xmath30 to the pdf in the free nucleon : @xmath31 the numerical parameterisation of @xmath32 is given for all parton flavours . here ,",
    "we restrict our study to gluons since , at high energy , the  is essentially produced through gluon fusion @xcite .",
    "several shadowing parametrisations are available  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to eks98  @xcite , which is very close to the mean in the current evaluation of the uncertainty  @xcite on the gluon npdf and exhibits a moderate antishadowing .",
    "we postpone the propagation of the uncertainty on the gluon npdf to the cnm effects evaluated at lhc energy for future studies .    the second cnm effect that we are going to take into account concerns the nuclear absorption . in the framework of the probabilistic glauber model",
    ", this effect is usually parametrised by introducing an effective absorption cross section  .",
    "it reflects the break - up of correlated  pairs due to inelastic scattering with the remaining nucleons from the incident cold nuclei .",
    "the value of  is unknown at lhc . at high energy ,",
    "the heavy state in the projectile should undergo a coherent scattering off the nucleons of the target nucleus  @xcite , in contrast with the incoherent , longitudinally ordered scattering that takes place at low energies .",
    "as argued in  @xcite , this should lead to a decrease of  with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "the systematic study of many experimental data indicate that  appears either constant  @xcite or decreasing  @xcite with energy .",
    "hence , we can consider our estimates  @xcite of  at rhic energy as upper bounds for the value of  at lhc .",
    "we choose three values of  that should span that interval ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "in the following , we present our results for the  nuclear modification factor due to cnm effects in the extrinsic sheme in  and pbpb collisions at @xmath2 : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the observed  yield in @xmath37 ( ) collisions and @xmath38 is the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions occurring in one  or pbpb collision . without nuclear effects , @xmath39 should equal unity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rppb_vs_y_and_rpbpb_vs_y_vs_cent - a ] , we show @xmath40 versus @xmath12 .",
    "the curve with no absorption allows to highlight the strong rapidity dependence of the shadowing .",
    "we can also notice that the shadowing alone should already be responsible for a quite large amount of  suppression , up to at @xmath41 .",
    "this is expected due to the very small @xmath15-region in the gluon npdf that becomes accessible at lhc energy ( down to @xmath42 ) .",
    "[ fig : rppb_vs_y_and_rpbpb_vs_y_vs_cent - b ] shows that the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath43 is similar for all the centrality bins , with a dip at mid-@xmath12 .",
    "this shape is the opposite of the one obtained at rhic energy  @xcite , with a peak at mid-@xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath43 is systematically smaller at mid-@xmath12 than at forward-@xmath12 .",
    "this is also illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : rpbpb_vs_npart ] , with the centrality dependence of @xmath43 for two regions in  @xmath12 .",
    "this behaviour of the cnm effects may partially  or completely  compensate the opposite effect expected from  recombination , with a maximum enhancement at @xmath44 .",
    "overall , one may observe a @xmath43 rather independent of @xmath12 resulting of two @xmath12-dependent effects .",
