    "the basic structure of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) includes a central continuum source and emission line gas , which , for some lines of sight is blocked from direct view by obscuring material of some form , possibly having the geometry of a torus .",
    "viewed along the opening cone of the torus such systems appear as unobscured seyfert 1 nuclei ( in the radio - quiet case ) , while from greater inclinations to the axis of the torus the broad lines cease to be directly visible and they appear as seyfert 2s .",
    "these are analogous to type 1 and 2 qsos in the radio - loud case .",
    "it has been clear from the outset that this simple picture , in which the opening angle of the torus is fixed for all systems , is unlikely to be true @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall show that the available data on the linewidth distribution of the broad emission lines can be interpreted in terms of an opening angle that increases with luminosity .",
    "the conclusion depends on the assumption that we can use the broad line widths at given luminosity to measure the angle of inclination of the axis of the obscuring matter to the line of sight .",
    "this implies both that the broad line region ( blr ) is axisymmetric and that its axis coincides with that of the obscuring material . in the case of radio - loud systems",
    "the axis of radio emission can be shown to correlate with broad line widths @xcite implying that the blr is axisymmetric and aligned orthogonally to the radio axis . in radio - quiet systems",
    "we have shown @xcite that the distribution of scatter on the linewidth ",
    "luminosity relation can be accounted for in terms of inclination .",
    "we examine these points further in section  [ sec : axisym ] .    at first sight",
    "we should be able to use our relation between linewidth , luminosity and inclination angle to measure the inclination of individual systems . despite the agreement with the statistical distribution however , we appear to find problems carrying this out , specifically that for a number of galaxies there is no solution for the angle .",
    "the reason for this can be readily seen if we bin the data into luminosity ranges and allow the distribution in @xmath0 of the objects to be determined by the data .",
    "we find that @xmath1 is restricted to a range @xmath2 where @xmath3 increases with luminosity @xmath4 ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath3 as a measure of the opening angle in the unified model .",
    "our original assumption that systems have random inclination , i.e.  @xmath0 is uniformly distributed in @xmath5 $ ] , is therefore not valid .",
    "we expect that the distribution of @xmath0 is constant at each luminosity , but the limited size of the data set does not show this clearly .",
    "in section  [ sec : fwhm_ax ] we consider the proposed anti - correlation between broad line widths and the x - ray spectral index , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we show that this is not primarily driven by a dependence of @xmath7 upon viewing angle , as might be expected from the dependence of fwhm upon orientation .",
    "the observed anti - correlation is at least partially due to the increased range of viewing angles at higher luminosities .",
    "the radio power in radio galaxies is generally accepted to be an indicator of viewing angle to the central source , with the flat spectrum core dominant in face - on systems and the steep spectrum lobes dominant in edge - on systems .",
    "the ratio of core to lobe radio power , @xmath8 , correlates with the width ( fwhm ) of h@xmath9 in the sense that the broadest lines are seen in more edge - on systems @xcite .",
    "wills & brotherton develop this further with the introduction of a new parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "this is defined to be the ratio of radio core luminosity at 5ghz rest frequency to the optical v - band luminosity - improving the measure of orientation .",
    "they show that @xmath10 has a stronger correlation than @xmath8 to the jet angle in a sample of 33 fr ii sources .",
    "further they show that using @xmath10 rather than @xmath8 also improves the correlation with fwhm@xmath11 for both the wills & browne objects and a new sample of low-@xmath12 quasars @xcite , thus strengthening the case for an axisymmetric blr in radio - loud systems .",
    "this evidence is supported by the correlation between fwhm and @xmath13 .",
    "the optical continuum is boosted by the jet in the face - on systems giving a viewing angle dependence for the optical to x - ray spectrum slope @xmath13 .",
    "the case is much less clear for the radio - quiet systems .",
    "here we have no such obvious inclination indicators as the jet angle . however , there is little , if any , strong evidence to suggest that the blr in radio - quiet systems should be significantly different to that in the radio - louds .",
    "studies of the distribution of line widths for radio - quiets and louds show only a small difference in the distributions with the radio - louds having generally wider lines @xcite .",
    "however , the radio - loud systems in this sample have a higher average luminosity .",
    "since higher luminosity systems have on average broader lines , at least for civ and h@xmath9 , the result is what we would expect if the systems are drawn from a common population .",
    "marziani et al .",
    "@xcite consider in more detail the differences between the profiles of h@xmath9 and civ lines in radio - loud and radio - quiet systems .",
    "they conclude that the line profile properties indicate that the blr in radio - louds is not the same as that in radio - quiets .",
    "we shall discuss their findings in the context of the results of this paper in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "boroson argues against a viewing angle dependent picture of radio - quiet agn in which _ both _ the continuum and line emission are axisymmetric by consideration of the lack of correlation between the equivalent width of [ oiii ] and the fwhm of h@xmath9 .",
    "the sample is selected by uv excess which may produce a bias against edge - on objects .",
    "in addition , according to the picture to be developed here , the range of angles for a low luminosity radio - quiet sample may be rather small , so the evidence may not be conclusive . in any case , all we require here is that the broad line region kinematics be axisymmetric , not that the illuminating continuum should be too .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "spherical blrs dominate the literature .",
    "however , to provide the observed variations in profile shape with width @xcite such systems have to be quite complex .",
    "for example robinson uses a changing radial depth and radial power laws for the velocity and emissivity of the gas to obtain the range of profile shapes . nevertheless , while this provides an adequate account of individual systems ,",
    "it is not clear whether models of this type can fit the linewidth distribution .",
    "a number of simple flow geometries in spherical systems are ruled out by detailed observation .",
    "for example , for ngc 3516 , goad et al .   exclude both radial flows at constant velocity and keplerian motion .",
    "spherically symmetric systems also do not appear to be able to account for the change in profile shape with line width or the range of widths at each luminosity needed to be able to account for the distribution of linewidths @xcite .",
    "simple disc geometries are also ruled out by consideration of the change in profile shape with linewidth @xcite . however more complex systems such as the dual winds model of cassidy & raine or the vblr  ilr model of wills et al .",
    "adopted by puchnarewicz et al .",
    "are able to predict the change in profile shape with linewidth required by observation @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach @xcite envisages a two - zone model which distinguished between high and low ionization lines .",
    "originally prompted by the systematic blueshift of civ relative to the balmer lines , which suggested origins in regions of different kinematics , and by considerations of energy balance , the idea has received some support from reverberation mapping .",
    "the h@xmath14 transfer function peaks away from zero delay ( for example in ngc 3516 , wanders & horne 1994 ) , consistent with a flattened cloud distribution , while the civ response is immediate ( for example ngc 5548 , korista et al.1995 ) , implying material in the line of sight . as a result the high ionization region ( hil )",
    "is often taken to be spherical , although alternative geometries are also consistent with echo mapping @xcite .",
    "although elsewhere we have argued that the statistical properties of the h@xmath9 , mgii and civ linewidth distributions do not indicate substantial differences between hil and lil geometries , the arguments in this paper depend only on the validity of some orientation effect in both h@xmath9 and mgii .",
    "while mgii emission is often taken to be associated with the balmer lines , and certainly arises from a region more extended than that producing civ ( from observed cross - correlation functions ) , it should perhaps be born in mind that we lack independent evidence for the geometry of the mgii emitting region .",
    "the current work therefore provides a further self - consistency argument for axisymmetry in the blr .",
    "one of the reasons for developing a viewing angle dependent model is the need for some parameter , other than luminosity , upon which the fwhm of the broad emission lines depends .",
    "it is of course possible that the dominant parameter could be something other than viewing angle .",
    "perhaps the most obvious choice would be black hole mass , @xmath15 .",
    "however the success of a model @xcite in which the unknown parameter varies as a sine function suggests that this is not the case : it is surely unrealistic to suggest that @xmath15 has only part of a sine distribution . furthermore , we will show in this paper that the range of values taken by this parameter increases with luminosity . assuming that @xmath16 then we would expect @xmath15 to take a smaller , rather than larger , range of values at higher luminosities .",
    "thus we assume that , in general , the fwhm , @xmath17 , of a given broad emission line in an axisymmetric system can be given as a function of the ionising luminosity and the inclination of the system .",
    "this function can be expanded in spherical harmonics with luminosity dependent coefficients . in a previous paper @xcite we showed that the distribution of linewidths could be reproduced if this function were taken to be axisymmetric and only the first two terms of this series were retained , with the coefficients taken to have a common dependence on luminosity .",
    "the fwhm of a given emission line is then given by @xmath18 with the constants @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath14 being chosen for each emission line .",
    "the inclination angle , @xmath1 , is the angle of the line of sight to the axis of the blr i.e.  @xmath21 for face - on systems . in rudge & raine we took @xmath4 to be the b - band luminosity .",
    "since it is difficult to determine the line of sight angle for individual systems , at least with any accuracy , we are led to consider the linewidth distribution rather than the linewidths of individual objects .",
    "assuming that the inclination of agn is random across the sky , then the number of systems at each @xmath17 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the luminosity function giving the distribution of luminosities . in rudge & raine",
    "we used the luminosity function of boyle , shanks & peterson . in the later work on cosmology",
    "@xcite we used the x - ray luminosity function of boyle et al . and also the optical luminosity function of pei . in this paper , for convenience , we will again use the x - ray luminosities .",
    "boyle et al .",
    "show that @xmath24 and thus using x - ray rather than optical luminosities will only result in the requirement of a different value of @xmath14 in ( [ eqn : vil ] ) .",
    "having developed this model and shown its success in accounting for the linewidth distribution @xcite we now use it to consider the viewing angle of individual systems . for this purpose",
    "we again use data from the rixos sample @xcite .",
    "this provides comprehensive data on x - ray and optical continuum luminosities as well as spectral indices , line strengths , equivalent widths and fwhm .",
    "rearranging ( [ eqn : vil ] ) gives @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the rosat 0.52kev luminosity in units of @xmath27 .",
    "the method for finding the orientation for each system relies on finding a good fit to the linewidth distribution for a sample of objects and then using the values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath14 in ( [ eqn : sini ] ) .",
    "it is therefore important that the distribution is accurately modelled .",
    "we found that it is no longer sufficient to assume that the given sample has a luminosity distribution which matches the global luminosity function , or that the distribution of @xmath0 is uniform - i.e.  systems are at random orientation .",
    "in such a situation we found that , although the linewidth distribution could be matched , it was not possible to generate simultaneously values of @xmath0 all lying in the range 0 to 1 .",
    "we therefore have to adopt an iterative procedure . in place of @xmath23 in ( [ eqn : lwd ] ) we use the actual number of systems in each luminosity bin , @xmath28 , for the selected sample .",
    "similarly we need to replace @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 , the number distribution of @xmath0 , is calculated by consideration of the whole sample in ( [ eqn : sini ] ) .",
    "we shall find that the @xmath0 distribution is also luminosity dependent and so we will in fact use @xmath32 , which , in practice , is determined for a set of discrete luminosity ranges .",
    "clearly we have to iterate to find @xmath32 and @xmath33 , by choice of @xmath34 and @xmath14 in ( [ eqn : vil ] ) , simultaneously in the revised linewidth distribution @xmath35",
    "the rosat international x - ray / optical survey ( rixos ) contains 160 agn compiled from serendipitous sources detected in pointed observations made with _ rosat_. the optical data was obtained using the isaac newton ( int ) and william herschel telescopes ( wht ) at la palma . as well as continuum luminosities and spectral slopes , the data contains ew , and fwhm for several optical emission lines . because of the range in redshift of the objects ( 0.032.92 with most objects at @xmath36 ) it is clearly not possible to measure these quantities for all the emission lines with only the wht and int .",
    "thus when considering the sample of agn in one particular line the sample size of 160 is greatly reduced and in some cases becomes too small to be of any real use .",
    "we will therefore concentrate on mgii with a sample size of 113 .",
    "[ fig : ldist ] shows the luminosity distribution for this sample .",
    "we note that the x - ray luminosities given in puchnarewicz et al",
    ". are not corrected for absorption intrinsic to the source agn .",
    "however from figure 17 of puchnarewicz et al .",
    "we see that 62@xmath37 of systems have an absorbing column , @xmath38 , of less than @xmath39 rising to 85@xmath37 at @xmath40 . at @xmath41 for a standard power law spectrum we find that the source luminosity should be @xmath42 higher than observed . for the values of @xmath43 and @xmath14 used here",
    "this gives values of @xmath1 that are @xmath44 higher .",
    "in most sources the effect will be much less than this and is therefore neglected .",
    "using ( [ eqn : lwd2 ] ) and iterating to a solution for @xmath32 we can predict the linewidth distribution for mgii . we obtain the values @xmath45 . this value for @xmath14",
    "is well constrained by consideration of both the baldwin effect for mgii and the observed correlation between fwhm and line equivalent width @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are then constrained tightly as @xmath20 gives the spread of the distribution and @xmath19 its centroid position .",
    "further constraints are placed on @xmath19 and @xmath20 by the obvious requirement that @xmath46 .",
    "[ fig : lwdfit ] shows a histogram of the data overlaid with the predicted distribution curve .",
    "[ fig : sinidist ] shows the self - consistent distribution of @xmath0 calculated from ( [ eqn : sini ] ) .",
    "since there are no strong angle - dependent selection effects , this distribution is at first sight incompatible with our interpretation of @xmath1",
    ".    however , fig .",
    "[ fig : lbinsini ] shows how the distribution of @xmath0 changes with luminosity , the division being into eight equally sized bins on a logarithmic scale between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that the maximum value of @xmath0 , and therefore @xmath3 increases with luminosity . within each bin",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is more uniform over the range @xmath49 than for the sample as a whole . from the dependence of @xmath3 upon @xmath4 shown in fig.[fig : lbinsini ] we fit a relation of the form @xmath50 finally table [ tab : rixosmgii ] shows the sources used , their luminosities , linewidths and the calculated inclination angle .",
    "@xmath51    @xmath52 [ tab : rixosmgii ]",
    "several samples of agn have shown an anti - correlation between fwhm and @xmath53 @xcite particularly for fwhm@xmath54 .",
    "the viewing angle dependence of the fwhm leads us to expect that @xmath7 might depend on @xmath1 also .",
    "puchnarewicz et al . also suggest that there is absorption of the soft x - rays in the objects with broader lines , i.e. the more edge - on objects .",
    "this might indicate a model in which the soft x - rays are increasingly absorbed by some sort of torus of dust / gas as the observer moves to a larger viewing angle . in the sample",
    "used here there is in fact a weak correlation between @xmath7 and fwhm@xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm_ax ] ) .",
    "we consider whether this correlation is at least in part due to the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig : axsini ] shows @xmath7 plotted against @xmath0 in luminosity bins .",
    "notice that their is no obvious anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 with the data divided in this way .",
    "in fact some luminosity bins indicate the opposite is true .",
    "this suggests that viewing angle is not the primary parameter determining @xmath56 .",
    "in this paper we have provided further evidence that the blr in agn is axisymmetric .",
    "the case for axisymmetry in radio - loud systems has always been strong with the observed correlations between line width , @xmath8 and @xmath13 . with no such obvious measure of inclination angle for radio - quiet systems",
    "the case is much harder to argue .",
    "the rixos data used here is made up of both radio - loud and quiet systems .",
    "there is no obvious failing of an axisymmetric model when applied to all systems , as would be expected if the radio - quiets were not axisymmetric .",
    "also , with no clear difference between the distribution of linewidths for radio - loud and radio - quiet systems , it is reasonable to expect that the linewidths in radio - quiet systems are , as in radio - loud systems , viewing angle dependent .",
    "marziani et al .",
    "argue the case for a significant difference between the structure of the blr in radio - loud and radio - quiets systems .",
    "they show that the h@xmath9 line profiles are predominantly redshifted and asymmetric in radio - louds whilst being usually unshifted and symmetric in the radio - quiets .",
    "conversely civ is largely unshifted and symmetric in radio - louds and blueshifted and asymmetric in radio - quiets .",
    "however , further inspection of the distribution of these properties shows that they are consistent with a single model for the blr when we take into account the effect of luminosity on opening angle . in the context of a disc - wind model such as those of cassidy & raine and chiang & murray we would expect the lines to be blue",
    "shifted if the viewing angle is along ( or close to ) the disc .",
    "this effect will be stronger in civ than in h@xmath9 which tends to be produced close to the disc where the outward velocity component is smaller and the outer clouds obscure the emission .",
    "this obscuration may also cause us to see h@xmath9 predominantly from the far side of the disc giving a tendency towards redshifted lines when the opening angle is large . in general radio - loud sources",
    "are observed at higher luminosities than radio - quiets and thus have a larger range of possible viewing angles to the blr .",
    "thus we would expect to see a blueshifted civ line in a smaller percentage of sources for radio - louds than radio - quiets .",
    "the effect is increased by the fact that in lower luminosity radio - quiets the opening angle is small and the radial velocity component is significant at all viewing angles .",
    "thus , rather than showing that the radio - loud and radio - quiets have different blr structures , figure 4 of marziani et al . can be interpreted as the change in the range of those properties observed due to the effect of increasing opening angle with luminosity .",
    "we have shown that for the rixos sample @xcite our calculation of the value of @xmath0 for each system gives a realistic distribution of angles",
    ". this distribution is , however , not uniform as originally assumed @xcite .",
    "when only a small range of luminosity is considered , it does become more uniform , but has a luminosity dependent maximum value for @xmath0 .",
    "this result further supports the assertion that the blr is axisymmetric . in unified models",
    "it is expected that the blr , whether axisymmetric or not , can be viewed only up to some maximum inclination , @xmath3 , before being obscured .",
    "it is also natural to expect that @xmath3 will be dependent upon luminosity in the sense that higher luminosity systems will have larger opening angles than low luminosity sources . in an axisymmetric blr model",
    "we have confirmed this result . providing evidence for this change in opening angle with luminosity",
    "has important implications for unified models .",
    "previously , the opening angle , at least for radio - quiet agn , has been estimated from the observed ratio of seyfert 1s to seyfert 2s .",
    "our results show that this estimate needs to be carried out at each luminosity rather than for complete samples .",
    "we have also been able to show that the spectral index , @xmath56 , is not dependent primarily upon viewing angle .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that the soft x - rays are obscured in more edge - on systems giving a harder continuum .",
    "this was in fact predicted from the rixos data by puchnarewicz et al .  .",
    "such a viewing angle dependence would also explain the observed correlation between fwhm@xmath11 and spectral index observed in other samples e.g. boroson & green , where the broader lines correspond to the harder x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , fig.[fig : axsini ] shows that when we plot @xmath7 against @xmath0 in luminosity bins we do not see the expected anti - correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "in fact at some luminosities the data suggests that a positive correlation is more likely .",
    "it appears that the observed anti - correlation is driven at least partly by the dependence of @xmath57 upon @xmath4 , and is not a consequence of an orientation dependent observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "we have shown that if the kinematics of mgii emission is axisymmetric then the cone opening angle in the unified model is dependent upon luminosity .",
    "the self - consistency of the picture provides support for the view that the blr is axisymmetric . as a consequence",
    "we deduce that the x - ray spectral index is not primarily dependent upon viewing angle .",
