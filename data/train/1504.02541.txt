    "the topic of the quantum heat engine ( qhe ) alicki , geva , bender2,quan2007,henrich , abah , yixxjpa , altintas has attracted a lot of interest since it was first proposed by scovil and schultz - dubois @xcite . a qhe converts heat into useful mechanical work from quantum working mediums , such as multilevel systems @xcite , harmonic oscillator systems @xcite , spins or coupled spins @xcite , optomechanical systems @xcite , relativistic particles @xcite and so on .",
    "many investigations have been carried out to explore various possible improvement of the heat engine that the efficiency of a qhe can surpass the efficiency of a classical carnot heat engine , and a qhe can extract work from a single heat bath scullyscience . due to the quantum properties of the working medium , or the effects of the quantum heat bath ,",

    "non - hermitian quantum theories arise as effective descriptions of certain open quantum systems , and therefore induce to an effective non - hermitian qhe in the presence of absorption and gain .",

    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian is rather different from a hermitian one , treating the system as a whole in describing the working medium and reservoirs .",
    "before start dealing with a heat engine cycle , we would like to briefly remark on the time evolution of a non - hermitian system , which involves both non - unitary evolution and complex geometrical phase of a state .",
    "the schrdinger equation is the common basis of both conventional and non - hermitian systems .",
    "a quantum state evolves along the solution of the schrdinger equation . according to the solution ,",

    "now we investigate a thermodynamic process for an adiabatic passage of the non - hermitian system . * *  * * for a traditional ( hermitian ) qhe , the temperature of a quantum working medium is introduced based on the thermalization assumption @xcite , that is , the working medium has the same distribution of occupation probability as the heat bath in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "then for such a small quantum system , the probability distribution is related to a parameter called spectral temperature . in this paper",
    ", we still employ such a concept for the non - hermitian two - level system , as an assumption .",

    "the system parameters are taken as @xmath41  initially where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . and the initial populations for the upper and lower levels are @xmath44  and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we express this mixed state by a density matrix@xmath46where eigenstate @xmath47  is normalized in the context of dirac inner product ( see appendix ) . here",
    "we assume that the boltzmann distribution  still refers to dirac probability even for a non - hermitian system .",
    "when a two - level system  couples to a heat bath , both systems obey the thermal equilibrium boltzmann distributions and then the two - level mixed state has its temperature .",
    "a density matrix would represent a thermal equilibrium state with temperature    @xmath48    where @xmath49  is the boltzmann constant . in quantum statistics ,",
    "the definition of temperature does not require the preservation of particle probability .",
    "it is only determined by the distribution of particle probability on each level .",
    "for a two - level system , one can always find a temperature which only depends on the ratio of the probabilities and the energy difference of two levels , i.e. , @xmath50where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the particle probability and the energy of two levels . at time @xmath53 , state @xmath54 evolves into state @xmath55  under the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "we note that the initial state does not involve a coherent superposition of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then the evolved mixed state does not involve a coherent superposition of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we only concern about the time evolution of the pure state @xmath61 .",
    "it is an acceptable consensus that the schrdinger equation is the common basis for both hermitian and non - hermitian quantum mechanics .",
    "whether the operator @xmath56  is hermitian or not , an evolved state , vector @xmath55 should be the solution of the schrdinger equation@xmath62with the initial condition @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly , the density matrix of the evolved mixed state becomes    @xmath64    where @xmath55  is probably not dirac normalized so as to contribute to the population @xmath65 .",
    "however , it is tough to get an analytical solution for an arbitrary time - dependent operator @xmath56 .",
    "fortunately , when we only consider the time evolution under the quantum adiabatic condition , i.e. , there is no transition between two levels , an approximate solution can be obtained .",

    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) tells us that any evolution along an arbitrary path in the @xmath71 plane is always adiabatic in the context of quantum mechanics , i.e. , there is no transition between two levels .",
    "nevertheless , it does not mean that the occupation probabilities for the levels and their distributions are always remaining invariant due to the contribution of the @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , which are unusual and exotic properties in the non - hermitian system in contrast to the hermitian one .",
    "moreover , we would demonstrate that the adiabatic  in our paper for the non - hermitian hamiltonian may be different from the one in the hermitian system because the occupation probability for each level is not invariant due to the image part of @xmath34 .",
    "but what both adiabatic processes of the hermitian and non - hermitian system have in common is that there is no tunneling between each level .",
    "therefore here we could call it generalized adiabatic  in our non - hermitian system .",
    "since all the processes considered in our work are generalized adiabatic , we only write it as the adiabatic  for simplification .",
    "now we consider a loop in the @xmath71 plane as a thermal cycle .",
    "according to the first law of thermodynamics , the total heat transferred in the cycle is @xmath72where @xmath73 is the partition function . here",
    "@xmath74  denotes the area enclosed by the loop in the @xmath71 plane .",
    "we can see that @xmath75 is nonzero for a non - trivial cycle , since a hyperbolic cosine function is positive definite .",
    "similarly , the net work done in the cycle is @xmath76which leads to @xmath77furthermore , a straightforward derivation shows that the entropy variation in the loop is@xmath78    according with the traditional thermodynamics , these indicate that the internal energy @xmath79  and entropy @xmath80  are state functions , which are only determined by the system parameters @xmath81 .",
    "we would like to point out that the facts of @xmath82 and @xmath83  in the loop are exclusive for a non - hermitian system .",
    "taking @xmath84 , the system is reduced to a hermitian one .",
    "we can see that @xmath85 @xmath86 , which indicates that the hermitian system is trivial as a qhe .",
    "more detailed , as mentioned above , the complex parameter represents the effect of reservoirs phenomenologically .",
    "once @xmath84 , the working medium is decoupled from reservoirs .",
    "there is no exchange between the working medium and the reservoirs .",
    "then the heat engine becomes trivial , since we do not assume extra reservoirs imposed on the system .",
    "this is different from the conventional hermitian qhe , which is always accompanied by the reservoirs .",
    "this reflects the key point of our work , replacing the imposed reservoirs by the imaginary parameter @xmath87 . in the context of quantum mechanics , processes for an arbitrary loop",
    "is spontaneously adiabatic without any extra condition .",
    "this may enhance the feasibility of experimental realizations of the present scheme .",
    "so far we have established an alternative description for qhes via a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "remarkably , all the thermal processes are adiabatic in a quantum mechanics manner . by this",
    "we mean that irrespective of whether there is energy transfer between the heat engine and reservoirs or not all the processes are adiabatic evolutions driven by a time - dependent hamiltonian . to understand such quantum processes , it is useful to contrast them to classical thermal processes . in the following ,",
    "we try to connect such a description to a classical engine , showing that the non - hermitian qhe is not a non - physics toy model .    to this end",

    "( [ solution ] ) , quantities , including the state parameters at each point and their variances in each process , are obtained and listed in tables [ table i]and [ table ii ] , respectively . according to the definition in the refs .",
    "@xcite , our calculations indicate that such an engine can operate at otto efficiency@xmath100    such a non - hermitian qhe does not violate the carnot efficiency limit which is of great significance in thermodynamics .",
    "this indicates that the non - hermitian hamiltonian still obeys some underlying rules in nature .",
    "we note that the probability is not conservative in the cycle , which differs from that in a hermitian system .",
    "we refer to this cycle as a variable - mass otto cycle .",

    "in order to obtain a clear physical picture of the non - hermitian qhe we construct a classical analogue of this scheme , which is a variable - mass cycle and consists of the following four steps , which is schematically illustrated in fig .",

    "it does no work on the surroundings .",
    "the temperature of the gas does not change during the process , and thus the addition is isothermal . the gas addition is associated by absorption of heat energy @xmath104 and increase of entropy @xmath105 from the high temperature reservoir .",
    "reversible adiabatic expansion of gas . for this step",
    ", the gas is allowed to expand and does work on the surroundings , whose expansion causes it to cool to the low temperature @xmath106 , with the entropy remaining unchanged .",
    "reversible isothermal deduction of gas at the low temperature @xmath106 . during this step a volume @xmath107 of the gas with the same temperature @xmath106  and the same density as the working medium is removed .",
    "such an amount of the gas contains heat energy @xmath108 and entropy @xmath109 , which flows to the low temperature reservoir .",
    "reversible adiabatic compression of gas . during this step",
    ", the surroundings do work on the gas , increasing its internal energy and compressing it , causing the temperature to rise to @xmath102 .",
    "the gas goes back to the state at the start .    for a standard cycle ,",
    "mass is conserved , i.e. , the working medium does not lose or increase mass .",
    "the present cycle transfers mass from hot to cool reservoirs , associating with the heat transfer .",
    "the essence of this cycle is that there is a volume of gas transferred from hot to cool reservoirs , rather than transfer the heat only .",
    "then the heat efficiency is always @xmath110 , which is independent of the mass transferred .",
    "therefore , the proposed variable - mass cycle would help us to make a better understanding of the non - hermitian cycle in some sense .",
    "we have studied a time - dependent non - hermitian @xmath1-symmetric two - level system , which could be regarded as a qhe .",
    "a non - hermitian hamiltonian turns out to be quite different from a hermitian one .",
    "it does not solely describe the working medium , but offers a full description including the working medium and external reservoirs .",
    "we have shown that any cycle can be implemented by an adiabatic time - evolution along a quantum adiabatic passage .",
    "as an example , a specific cycle which operates at otto efficiency is presented .",
    "moreover , we have also discussed a classical analogue of this scheme , which corresponds to a variable - mass cycle , transferring not only heat but also mass from hot to cool reservoirs .",
    "our main conclusion is that the proposed non - hermitian hamiltonian can provide an alternative description for the qhe , leading to a deeper and better understanding of the role that a non - hermitian hamiltonian takes in physics .    finally , we would like to point that there is a long way to go for connecting the current non - hermitian 2-level system to a hermitian description of qhe by using a rigorous mathematical formulation .",
    "it is due to the subtle relation between hermitian and non - hermitian hamiltonians : on the one hand , a non - hermitian hamiltonian is usually thought to be a better candidate for describing some natural processes in an open system , which do not follow the conservation of law of mass and energy .",
    "however , on the other hand , it is still a challenge to get a perfect connection between a non - hermitian hamiltonian and a hermitian one with a clear physical picture , although many efforts have been dedicated to this topic @xcite .",

    "now we extend the adiabatic theorem to the non - hermitian hamiltonian and we will show that such an extension is correct . this extension can be simply applied by taking the biorthonormal inner product to replace the dirac inner product . then under the quantum adiabatic condition @xmath120phase @xmath34 can be expressed as@xmath121 \\left ( 1-i\\lambda \\gamma /\\sqrt{1-\\gamma ^{2}}\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\]]similar works have been done in many systems gao , nesterov1,nesterov2,cui , liang , and this conclusion can also be obtained by an exact solution of schrdinger equation@xmath122 in this concrete example . here",
    "our @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath12 could be used to describe an open system , which is different from @xcite that is used to describe a closed system .",
