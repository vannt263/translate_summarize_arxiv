    "the present study tackles this problem for the valuation and hedging of derivatives with uncertainty about the volatility of the underlying .",
    "the most widely used approach in the extant literature , dating back to the seminal papers of avellaneda , levy , and pars @xcite and lyons @xcite , is the so - called _ uncertain volatility model _ ( uvm ) . here",
    ", the single probabilistic model used in the classical setting is replaced by a whole class of different alternatives .",
    "these are evaluated with a worst - case approach , both with respect to the `` risk '' inherent in a given model and with respect to the `` knightian uncertainty '' about which model should be applied in the first place . more specifically , the uvm assumes only that the true volatility evolves within a band @xmath0 $ ] , without any assumptions on its dynamics . in this",
    "setting , one then tries to determine the cheapest hedge that removes all downside risk under _ any _ conceivable model , corresponding to infinite aversion against both risk and uncertainty .",
    "this approach is well - suited to determine universal no - arbitrage bounds and has initiated a tremendous amount of research ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , by its very definition it is also very conservative : unless a given model is ruled out a priori , it is treated in exactly the same way as the most plausible alternatives , say point estimates derived from market prices or statistical procedures .",
    "if the volatility band is chosen very wide , then the bid - ask spread induced by the worst - case approach is very large and a market maker quoting these bid - ask prices will not find customers in any competitive environment .",
    "if one artificially tightens the band of volatility scenarios to obtain competitive prices , the risk that the true volatility strays out of the band increases . finally , the worst - case approach often incorporates options specific sensitivities to volatility only in a bang - bang fashion .",
    "for instance , the ask price of a call option always equals the black ",
    "scholes price with volatility equal to the maximal value @xmath1 .",
    "this holds even if the price of the underlying is far away from the strike , where the option s sensitivity to changes in volatility is very low . a more nuanced attitude towards model uncertainty should reflect that in the context of hedging , agents are typically more concerned about volatility misspecification when it matters  that is , if the option value s sensitivity to volatility is high .    to address these issues , one can consider preferences that interpolate between the classical and the worst - case approach by weighing different models according to their plausibility .",
    "maccheroni , marinacci , and rustichini @xcite provide a decision - theoretic , axiomatic foundation for criteria of this kind .",

    "one interpretation is that the decision maker behaves as if she was facing a malevolent opponent ( `` nature '' ) who takes advantage of her uncertainty by choosing a probability scenario @xmath5 that minimises her penalised expected utility .",
    "the standard expected utility framework corresponds to the case where @xmath6 is zero for a single model @xmath5 and @xmath7 otherwise . if @xmath6 is zero for a whole class of models @xmath8 that are considered ( equally ) reasonable and @xmath7 otherwise , we are in the worst - case approach and reduces to the _ multiple priors preferences _ of gilboa and schmeidler  @xcite .",
    "another well - known special case of is given by the _ multiplier preferences _ of hansen and sargent @xcite , which penalise models based on their relative entropy with respect to a fixed reference model . with this approach",
    ", the user is not required to draw a strict line between `` reasonable '' and `` wrong '' models ; instead , less plausible models are penalised according to how much they differ from the reference model .",
    "this specification excludes any uncertainty about volatility as the relative entropy is only finite for models that are absolutely continuous with respect to the reference model .",
    "accordingly , this line of research has mostly focused on portfolio choice problems with uncertainty about future expected returns . with a different penalty functional , however , the same philosophy can also be applied to price and hedge options with uncertainty about the volatility of the underlying , as we do in the present study .",
    "more specifically , we use the following general approach :    1 .   choose a _ reference model _ that you believe describes the true dynamics of the stock price reasonably well .",
    "make sure that this model matches the market prices of liquidly traded derivatives on the stock .",
    "2 .   devise a nonnegative _ penalty functional _ that attaches a penalty to each alternative model and reflects how seriously you take it ; the higher a model s penalty , the less plausible it is .",

    "4 .   find a trading strategy that maximises this performance criterion .    in this paper , we choose a local volatility reference model @xcite",
    "this allows to incorporate the spot prices of vanilla options , but still isolates the impact of model uncertainty from additional complexities arising from incompleteness or additional state variables .",

    "we find that for many exotics like asian , lookback , or barrier options , the above representations for the price and hedge corrections remain valid .",
    "the only change is that the option s price in the reference model and its corresponding cash gamma depend on further state variables in these cases .",
