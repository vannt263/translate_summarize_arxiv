    "fig : strip ] ) , although a clear separation between generic ir sources and the region preferentially populated by _ fermi",
    "_  blazars is visible , no peculiar color pattern is observed for bzbs and bzqs .",
    "moreover , a large fraction of the _ fermi _  bzqs considered do not have a 2mass counterparts ( see table  [ tab : detect ] ) , strongly limiting the potential efficiency and completeness of methods for the association of ugs based on 2mass photometry .",
    "the region occupied by the _ fermi _",
    "blazars in the 2mass color - color plot is similar to that previously indicated by chen et al .",

    "however , about 30% of the blazars in the chen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample show near - ir colors corresponding to a blackbody spectral shape , suggesting a possible contributions from their host galaxies .",
    "such strong contamination is not present at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "to assess the significance of the _ infrared@xmath0-ray connection _ , we performed a statistical analysis of the correlation between the @xmath0-ray photon index @xmath4 of the _ fermi _  blazars and the _ wise _",
    "mid - ir colors , since colors are a surrogate of the spectral index .",
    "we found a strong correlation between @xmath4 and both the _ wise _",

    "[ fig : corr ] .",
    "this result constitutes the first direct evidence of the existence of the _",
    "ir@xmath0-ray connection_.          in both cases , the correlation is more statistically significant for bzbs rather than for bzqs .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient @xmath17 estimated for the @xmath4 vs [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] @xmath3 m correlation is 0.47 for bzbs , with negligible probability to be spurious . on the other hand ,",
    "for the bzqs , we obtained @xmath180.15 calculated with 419 sources and still with a negligible chance probability , given the large number of objects considered .",
    "when using the data for the whole sample of 1022 _ fermi _  blazars , the linear correlation coefficient , unsurprisingly , increases to @xmath180.65 thanks to the quite distinct distributions of both bzbs and bzqs in the @xmath4 @xmath19 [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] @xmath3 m plane .",
    "a similar situation is observed in the @xmath4 @xmath19 [ 4.6]-[12 ] @xmath3 m plane , where the correlation coefficients for the 595 bzbs and the 419 bzqs separately are @xmath180.48 and @xmath180.13 respectively , both with negligible chance probability .",
    "the correlation coefficient for the whole _ fermi _  blazar sample ( 1014 sources ) is @xmath17=0.60 , lower than the previous one due to the scatter in the plane introduced by the larger uncertainties on the mid - ir magnitudes at 12@xmath3 m .",
    "the slope of the best fit regression lines in both cases , as expected , is driven by the stronger correlations found for the bzbs .",
    "finally , we did not find any significant trend between the 2mass j , h and k colors , corrected for galactic extinction , and the _ fermi _",
    "@xmath0-ray spectral index @xmath4 .",
    "since the release of the first observations carried out with the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ , a link between radio and @xmath0-ray emissions of blazars appeared evident ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this well established _",
    "radio@xmath0-ray connection _ has mostly driven the searches for counterparts associable with @xmath0-ray sources @xcite , and has been invoked to justify radio - follow up observations of the positional uncertainty regions for ugss to date ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this connection between the blazar emission at @xmath1 1ghz and at gev energies is due to the correlation between their flux densities and , consequently , their powers .",
    "thanks to the large increase of the number of blazars detected by _ fermi _ it has become possible to study the presence of biases and selection effects that have to be taken into account to confirm the radio@xmath0-ray connection .",
    "intrinsic variability , redshift dependence , source misidentifications and incorrect associations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to name a few effects that can mimic a spurious trend , were not found to affect this correlation .",
    "based on this analysis , the existence of the radio@xmath0-ray connection ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) was recently confirmed by ackermann et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .     for the sake of comparison , it is worth stressing that the _ radio@xmath0-ray connection _ is based on the correlation between the radio and @xmath0-ray flux densities .",
    "a similar trend also exists for the mid - ir emission as shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] , which display the 3.4 @xmath3 m and the 12@xmath3 m magnitudes vs @xmath0-ray flux density for both confirmed _ fermi _  bzbs and bzqs .     based on the discussion in the previous section , it appears evident that the _ ir@xmath0-ray connection _ is stronger than the radio@xmath0-ray one , because it is not only a link between flux densities but it also involves a tight connection between spectral shapes of the emitting particles",
    "we stress the strength of the _ ir@xmath0-ray connection _ by showing that potential counterparts of 3fgl ugss selected via their wise mid - ir colors are in good agreement with the correlation between the [ 3.4 ] and [ 12 ] wise colors and the @xmath0-ray @xmath4 spectral index discussed in ",

    "as shown in the @xmath4 @xmath19 [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] @xmath3 m diagram ( fig .",

    "_ fermi _  blazars have a low detection rate in the 2mass catalog , mainly due the 2mass higher flux limit compared to _ wise _  survey .",

    "<S> using data from the _ wise _  all - sky survey we discovered that the non - thermal infrared ( ir ) emission of blazars , the largest known population of extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources , has peculiar spectral properties . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we confirm and strengthen our previous analyses using the latest available releases of both the _ wise _  and the _ fermi _  source catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that there is a tight correlation between the mid - ir colors and the @xmath0-ray spectral index of _ fermi _  blazars . </S>",
    "<S> we name this correlation _ the infrared@xmath0-ray connection_. we discuss how this connection links both the emitted powers and the spectral shapes of particles accelerated in jets arising from blazars over ten decades in energy . based on this evidence </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that _ the infrared@xmath0-ray connection _ is stronger than the well known _ radio@xmath0-ray connection_. </S>"
