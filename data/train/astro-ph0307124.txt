    "a fundamental goal of observational cosmology is to determine the spatial distribution of galaxies as a function of galaxy properties , _",
    "e.g. _ , luminosity , morphology , star formation rate _ etc .",
    "_ , as such observations place constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in recent years , there has been an explosion in such work due to improvements in the theoretical modeling of galaxy evolutionary processes ( _ e.g. _ , kauffmann et al . 1999 ; benson et al .",
    "2002 ) and the availability of large amounts of high quality survey data , _",
    "e.g. _ , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , las campanas redshift survey ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) and the century survey ( wegner et al . 2001 ) .    in this paper , we focus on one aspect of such research , namely the relation between the fraction@xmath8 of local galaxies that possess an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and the local environment of those galaxies",
    ". such observations can provide new constraints on models of galaxy evolution ( _ e.g. _ , how the agn may affect other galaxy properties like star  formation ) , as well as providing insights into the physical mechanism(s ) powering the agn .",
    "for example , an agn could be fueled by the same cold gas in the disk component of galaxies that is driving the star ",
    "formation rate ( sfr ) of those galaxies . in this case",
    ", the existence of an agn might diminish in dense regions , analagous to the sfr - density relation ( see lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; gomez et al .",
    "2003 , carter et al .",
    "alternatively , several authors have proposed that galaxy  galaxy collisions fuel the agn activity by driving gas into the cores of galaxies and thus onto the black hole ( gunn 1979 ; shlosman 1990 ) .",
    "a third possible empirical model proposed by kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) suggests that supermassive black holes are solely a bulge phenomena and were formed at the same time as the bulge component of galaxies at an much earlier epoch in the universe . in this model ,",
    "the distribution of agns would then trace the distribution of bulges , under the assumption that agns are powered by supermassive black holes ( lynden  bell 1964 ) .",
    "therefore , by studying the fraction of galaxies that possess an agn , as a function of environment , one can obtain constraints on such models of agn activity and formation .",
    "observationally , the fraction of galaxies with an agn has increased as the quality and quantity of the spectral data has improved . in the early work of dressler ,",
    "thompson , & shectman ( 1985 ) , they found that only a few percent of galaxies possessed an agn ( see also huchra & burg 1992 ) , and there were approximately five times as many agns in the field compared to the cores of clusters . in recent years , carter et al .",
    "( 2001 ; cfgkm hereafter ) measured an agn fraction of 17% , while ho , fillipenko & sargent ( 1997 ) find an agn fraction of @xmath9 ( this difference depends upon the details of the spectral definition of an agn ) .",
    "furthermore , there is now less evidence for an environmental dependence on the agn fraction ( see cfgkm ) .",
    "herein , we present the _ agn  density _ relation for galaxies in the early data release ( edr ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "this relation is analogous to the _ sfr  density _ ( hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 , cfgkm ) and _ morphology  density _ ( dressler et al . 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ; dressler et al . 1997 ) relations we have presented elsewhere in gomez et al . ( 2003 ) and goto et al .",

    "1999 ) . in section [ data ]",
    ", we discuss the data and techniques used for identifying an agn in the sdss galaxies . in section [ density ] , we present our results on the _ agn  density _ relation , while in section [ discussion ] , we discuss these results and their physical implications . we conclude in section [ conclusions ] . throughout this paper",
    ", we used @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the data are taken from the early data release of the sdss ( see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; see also blanton et al . 2003 ; fukugita et al .",
    "2003 ; gunn et al . 1998 ; hogg et al . 2001 ; pier et al . 2003 ; smith et al . 2002 ; strauss et al .",
    "one of the unique features of the sdss is the sophisticated data analysis software pipelines used to reduce the raw images and spectra into large catalogs of sources and measured properties .",
    "briefly , for each flux  calibrated sdss spectrum , a redshift is determined from both the absorption lines , via cross - correlation , and the emission lines , via a wavelet  based peak  finding algorithm ( see frieman et al . in prep ) . once the redshift is known , the spectroscopic pipeline estimates the continuum emission at each pixel by using the median value seen in a sliding box of 100 pixels centered on that pixel .",
    "emission and absorption lines are measured by fitting a gaussian , above the continuum , at the redshifted rest ",
    "wavelength of the lines . in order to avoid line blending ,",
    "the sdss pipeline fits multiple gaussians in such cases as   and .",
    "thus , the spectroscopic pipeline provides a high quality estimate of the equivalent width ( ew ) , continuum , rest  wavelength , identification , goodness  of  fit ( @xmath13 ) , height and sigma ( and the associated errors on these quantities ) for all the major emission and absorption lines in galaxy spectra .",
    "this extensive emission and absorption line database , when combined with color and morphological information from the sdss photometric survey , is ideal for studying the properties of low redshift galaxies .",
    "the galaxy sample we use is similar to the one described in gomez et al .",
    "briefly , we define a pseudo volume - limited sample by restricting the analysis to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath14 , and to galaxies more luminous than a ( k  corrected ; blanton et al . 2002 ) @xmath15 which is @xmath16 assuming @xmath17 from blanton et al .",
    "the lower redshift limit is to minimize aperture bias ( see gomez et al .",
    "2003 and section [ aperture ] ) due to large nearby galaxies , while the upper redshift limit corresponds to where luminosity limit equals the apparent magnitude limit of the sdss ( @xmath18 ; strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the sdss edr covers a contiguous area of @xmath19 square degrees with a complicated geometry .",
    "much of the area is contained within two long stripes that are @xmath20 degrees wide in declination , centered on the celestial equator .",
    "thus , many of the galaxies in the edr are close to a survey boundary .",
    "this geometry requires that careful attention be paid to any measure of local galaxy density measurements .",
    "we have chosen to use the distance to the 10@xmath21 nearest neighbor ( see section [ density ] ) to infer local densities .    to avoid a biased density measure ,",
    "we have excluded galaxies that have a survey edge closer than the distance to the 10@xmath21 nearest neighbor . we have tested this method of `` edge correction '' using the mock galaxy catalogs of cole et al .",
    "we used these data to create a mock galaxy catalog with the same geometry as the sdss edr , and then measure the projected distance to the 10@xmath21 nearest neighbor in the full mock ( _ i.e. _ , without edges ) and within the catalog with the edr geometry .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ fig::density_bias ] , which shows that if we ignore edges , the measured distance to the 10@xmath21 nearest neighbor is biased towards higher values compared to the true 10@xmath21 nearest neighbor distance . however , as expected , once we remove all galaxies which have an edge closer than the 10@xmath21 nearest neighbor , we then recover the true distances , or local densities .",
    "figure [ fig::density_bias ] shows the importance in correctly accounting for edges in surveys with complicated volumes , such as the sdss edr .",
    "we note that while the edge correction produces an unbiased estimate of the density ( as shown in figure [ fig::density_bias ] ) , the _ distribution _ of densities for our sample is different than the whole edr survey . in figure",
    "[ fig::zhisto ] , we plot the redshift histogram of our sample before and after the edge correction is made .",
    "the edge correction results in a smaller survey area ( than the whole edr ) at the lowest redshift , as the volume sampled at @xmath22 is small compared to the typical distance to the 10@xmath21 nearest galaxy neighbor ) .",
    "additionally , since galaxies in dense environment have closer neighbors than galaxies in voids , we preferentially sample dense regions more often than sparse regions ; we note however that the signal - to - noise of the measured densities is independent of this effect as we alway use 10 galaxies to define the local galaxy density .",
    "our results are robust against this bias in the _ distribution _ of densities for two reasons .",
    "first , we only study herein the _ fraction of galaxies _ as a function of the various galaxy types ( _ i.e. _ , agn , star - forming and passive ) and have binned the galaxies in density such that each bin has @xmath23 galaxies per bin ( this changes slightly for the analyses as a function of redshift ) .",
    "therefore , higher density regions are more finely binned compared to lower density regions .",
    "secondly , we have divided our sample into three nearly equal volume subsets , as a function of redshift , and show that our conclusions are independent of redshift ( see figure [ fig::bias ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the bias seen in figure [ fig::zhisto ] is unimportant . in summary ,",
    "our tests show that we possess an unbiased estimate of the local ( projected ) galaxy density over two orders of magnitude in the density , _",
    "i.e. _ , from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( see figure [ fig::density_bias ] ) .",
    "our final , edge - corrected sample , contains 4921 galaxies with a mean spectral signal - to - noise ratio@xmath26 for their spectra of 24 .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 3900   to 9100 , with a spectral - resolution of 1800 .",
    "we note here that there are 27 sources spectrally classified by the sdss software pipeline as quasars within the sample limits defined above .",
    "these 27 low redshift qsos ( which are actually seyfert type i agns ) possess extremely broad lines making it difficult to obtain line flux - ratio measurements ( especially for   and   which lie only 20   apart ) .",
    "we note that a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates no difference between the environments of these low - z qsos and of our agn sample defined in section [ identify ] . therefore ,",
    "as there are so few of these objects ( 0.5% of our total sample ) , and they exist in the same environments as our full agn sample ( of nearly 1000 galaxies ) , we ignore these qsos unless otherwise noted .",
    "to classify agns , we use the traditional log(/ ) versus log(/ ) flux - ratio diagnostic diagrams as discussed by baldwin , philips & telervich ( 1981 ) , villieux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) and kewley et al .",
    "the flux of these emission lines are determined using the fitted heights and sigmas of the lines as measured by the sdss data analysis pipeline .",
    "we initially restrict our analysis to lines with a measured flux over flux error of @xmath27 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 detections . in figure [ fig::diagnostic ] ( left ) ,",
    "we show the model ( solid line ) used to separate star  forming galaxies from agns . galaxies which lie above , and to the right of , this model are classified as agns , while galaxies beneath , and to the left , are classified as star  forming galaxies .    for the 4921 galaxies in our pseudo volume - limited sample ,",
    "3647 have at least one @xmath29 emission line detection , while 1293 galaxies have all of the four lines required in figure [ fig::diagnostic ] for an unambiguous classification ( _ e.g. _ , the , ,   and   emission lines ) .",
    "most of the galaxies with these four emission lines ( 82% ) are classified as star - forming galaxies .",
    "these star - forming galaxies have a median   equivalent width ( ew ) of 26 .",
    "the remaining 235 galaxies are classified as agns with a median   ew of 13 .",
    "we call these the `` 4line agns '' for the rest of the paper .",
    "we have made no attempt to classify these agns into sub ",
    "populations like liners , seyferts i or ii . we simply note that these 235 agns do cover a broad range of agn types .",
    "likewise , we have made no attempt to study the individual properties of the agns .",
    "we note here that it is not necessary to possess significant detections of all four of these lines ( , ,   and ) to unambiguously detect an agn in a galaxy ; although one does need all four lines to unambiguously classify star - forming galaxies .",
    "we illustrate this fact in figure [ fig::separ ] , which shows that galaxies with either a high /  , or a high /  , line ratio must be an agn ( see cfgkm ) , regardless of the other line ratio .",
    "[ we note that we find no agns using solely the /   line ratio ] . star ",
    "forming galaxies only inhabit the bottom left  hand corner of figure [ fig::diagnostic ] .",
    "for example , if a galaxy has   and   lines detected at @xmath29 confidence , but no significant detection of   or , we can still classify it as an agn if log(/)@xmath30 .",
    "carter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used a similar technique to extract additional agns in their data . to differentiate these agns from the 4line agns discussed above , we call these agns `` 2line agns '' , as they are classified using only two lines .",
    "these `` 2line agns '' have much lower line strengths than the `` 4line agns '' , as they possess a median ew of h@xmath31 .",
    "however , there is no difference in the signal - to - noise ratios of the `` 2line '' agn spectra compared to `` 4line '' agn spectra . in figure [ fig::llagn ] , we show the /   flux - ratios for these 2line agns .    using log(/)@xmath30 , we have increased our agn sample from 235 ( 4line agns ) to 936 galaxies .",
    "thus , the majority of our agns are classified using only the   and   lines , which has two important advantages compared to the 4line method .",
    "first , the classification is unambiguous , since we have chosen line ratios high enough to exclude nearly all star  forming galaxies in figure 1 .",
    "second ,   and   are close together in wavelength so we have no concerns about the amount of internal dust extinction when classifying these galaxies .",
    "there remains a large number of galaxies that have at least one @xmath29 detection of an emission line , but can not be classified using either the 2line or 4line method discussed above .",
    "we call these galaxies `` emission line but unclassified '' ( elu ) galaxies .",
    "we discuss these further in section [ elu ] .",
    "any galaxy with no @xmath29 detected emission lines is classified as `` passive '' . in table 1 , we present the fraction of galaxies as a function of these different classifications .      to study the effect of measurement errors ( see cfgkm ) , we apply a different classification technique to our sample , which utilizes the observed error on the line ratios , and calculates the probability that each galaxy is either star  forming or contains an agn .",
    "the method uses the false discovery rate ( fdr ) described in miller et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and has the advantage of controlling the amount of contamination in each class of galaxies , which is the scientifically meaningful quantity . for our fdr technique , we drop the requirement that all lines must be detected at the @xmath29 confidence level , and instead use all lines that have a positive value ( _ i.e. _ , emission ) regardless of their measurement error .    to use fdr , we must begin by assuming a null hypothesis and test each galaxy against that null hypothesis .",
    "our first null hypothesis is to assume that any galaxy below the model line shown in figure [ fig::diagnostic ] is a star  forming galaxy , _",
    "i.e. _ , it has a probability of 1 of being star  forming .",
    "then , for all galaxies above the line in our sample , we assign a probability of being star ",
    "forming assuming the errors on the line ratios are gaussian .",
    "once we have a probability for each galaxy , we use fdr to reject galaxies from this null hypothesis ( _ i.e. _ , they are agns ) at a confidence level of 90% .",
    "therefore , we obtain a sample of agns that is guaranteed to have less than 10% contamination from star - forming galaxies .",
    "we then alter our null hypothesis , so that all galaxies above the model line in figure [ fig::diagnostic ] are classified as agns , and re  calculate the probability for each galaxy below the line .",
    "once again we use fdr to control the false detection rate and obtain a sample of star  forming galaxies that are rejected based on this new null hypothesis . again , this guarantees fewer than 10% contamination by agns in our sample of star  forming galaxies .",
    "this procedure produces a robust sample of star  forming and agn classifications , as well as galaxies that are unclassified because they were rejected against both null hypotheses .    in figure [ fig::diagnostic ] ( right )",
    "we plot the flux ratio diagnostic diagram constructed using the fdr method described above . in this figure , all galaxies with line ratios close to the model separating agns and star  forming galaxies are unclassified .",
    "the fdr classification scheme ( which properly treats the errors on the line - fluxes and ratios ) picks up more agn with weak lines ( _ i.e. _ some less than 2@xmath32 ) at the expense of missing `` transition galaxies '' which have evidence of both star - formation and an agn .",
    "overall , the fdr method is more conservative than the the @xmath29 line method described in section [ identify ] .",
    "however , we still find a similar fraction of agns and star  forming galaxies as we did when simply requiring all lines were detected at the @xmath29 confidence .",
    "for example , the total number of 4line and 2line agns we calculate using the fdr method is similar to that found using the @xmath29 method ; 14% for fdr compared to 19% in table 1 .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic analysis pipeline ( see section [ data ] ) determines the location and flux of an emission line via a gaussian fit to the spectral data .",
    "this fit does not account for the possibility of stellar absorption which would lie underneath any emission line .",
    "such absorption could lead to a systematic uncertainty in the measured flux of the hydrogen emission lines in the sdss spectra ( see gomez et al .",
    "2003 ; goto et al .",
    "2003 ) . to overcome such problems , several authors ( ho , fillipenko , sargent 1997 ; coziol et al .",
    "1998 ) have advocated using template spectra to estimate the amount of stellar absorption underneath the hydrogen lines .",
    "such a technique involves fitting the continuum flux of each galaxy spectrum with these templates and finding the best fit .",
    "then , the emission lines are measured taking into account the expected amount of stellar absorption as seen in the best  fit template spectrum .",
    "this technique has the advantage of being more sensitive to lower luminosity agns ( llagns ) , as one is able to identify and measure the weaker emission lines .",
    "this , in part , explains why ho , fillipenko , sargent ( 1997 ) and coziol et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find more agns than previous studies who did not use template fitting techniques .",
    "we examine here the issue of low luminosity agns and test our ability of finding such sources using our agn identification techniques as discussed in section [ identify ] . as a basis for our tests ,",
    "we compare our analysis with the sample of 82 hickson group galaxies studied by coziol et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who used the template fitting technique to study the llagn population in groups of galaxies .",
    "as we see no dependence on the agn fraction with environment ( see section [ density ] ) , the environment of the coziol et al .",
    "sample is irrelevant and does not bias our tests . in figure [ fig::llagn ] , we present the observed rest - frame equivalent width of   for galaxies in our sample as a function of their observed /   line ratio .",
    "only galaxies with @xmath29 detections of both the   and   lines are shown here .",
    "figure [ fig::llagn ] is therefore similar to figure 5 in coziol et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who use such a diagram as a diagnostic to indicate the separation between star  forming galaxies , agns and llagns .",
    "we find a significant population of our 2line agns are llagns , as they possess weak   and   emission lines , _",
    "e.g. _ , only a few    of ew in these detected lines .",
    "this is because of the high resolution of the sdss spectra ( 2.3   per resolution element ) , which helps de  blend the   doublet and   emission lines , and the high mean signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n@xmath33 ) of our llagn spectra .",
    "therefore , we have the sensitivity to detect any strong   and   emission in these spectra if it was present . in summary , most of our 2line agn detections are llagns , as by definition they possess weaker   and   emission lines ( but with a large line ratio ) , and no detectable   and   emission .",
    "we note here that we find no correlation between our   fluxes and the signal - to - noise of the spectra .",
    "in other words , it is not the case that all of our low   flux galaxies have low s / n spectra ( and thus large errors ) .      our ability to detect llagns ( discussed above ) and our agreement with coziol et al .",
    "( 1998 ) indicates that our method can accurately classify agns without the need for template fitting . to expand on this ,",
    "we have performed two tests quantify the effect of stellar absorption on our classifications .",
    "first , we have visually inspected the profiles of the   and   emission lines in the spectra of the 50 agns with the smallest   equivalent widths that are close to the model line in figure [ fig::llagn ] . using the absorption in   as an upper limit to the total possible stellar absorption in the galaxy",
    ", we conclude that @xmath34 of these 50 galaxies could change classification from agn to star - forming .",
    "these inspections demonstrate that only @xmath35% of these lowest luminosity agns are affected by stellar absorption .",
    "second , we add 0.7   of stellar absorption to all the hydrogen lines in our spectra and re - classified them . this mean amount of stellar absorption has been estimated by hopkins et al .",
    "( in prep ) to obtain consistent measurements of the sfr of sdss galaxies using h@xmath36 , [ oii ] , @xmath37-band luminosity , with the iras infrared luminosities and radio luminosities from the first survey .",
    "after applying this absorption correction , our total fraction of agns changes from 19% ( in table 1 ) to 17% .",
    "we conclude from both of these tests that our final sample of `` 2line '' and `` 4line ''",
    "agns is robust against stellar absorption corrections .",
    "since we are not attempting to measure precise line fluxes in this work , we ignore stellar absorption throughout the rest of this work .",
    "we investigate here aperture effects due to the limited radius of the sdss spectroscopic fibers ( only 1.5 arcseconds in radius ) , using the sdss photometric data to measure the fraction of light contained within the fiber ( 1.5 arcseconds ) , compared to the total light of a galaxy , as defined by the petrosian 90% radius ( see stoughton et al .",
    "2001 for more details ) .",
    "we begin by noting that this fraction is approximately the same for all galaxy types discussed herein , _ i.e. _ , we find the fraction of the total light within the fiber to be 25% for star - forming galaxies , 23% for agn , and 27% for passive galaxies .",
    "thus , over our redshift range , our spectral identifications are not biased towards any specific galaxy type .    in figure [ fig::han2_agn_v_radius ]",
    ", we plot the measured [ nii]/h@xmath36 line ratio , as a function of the fraction of the total light within the sdss fiber , for galaxies classified as either an agn or a star  forming galaxy .",
    "we see no evidence for any aperture bias for either agns or star - forming samples ( nor as a function of luminosity ) . in figure",
    "[ fig::han2_vz ] , we plot the measured [ nii]/h@xmath36 line ratio as a function of redshift and again , see no evidence for aperture bias with redshift .      the main sdss galaxy sample is designed to be near complete to our chosen magnitude limit ( see strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) and therefore , we expect our pseudo volume  limited sample of galaxies to be nearly - complete in both redshift and absolute magnitude within the limits specified in section [ data ] .",
    "the use of an absolute magnitude limited survey is crucial for future comparisons to theoretical work ( via simulations or semi - analytic techniques ) .",
    "we stress that our agn fraction as determined using all unambiguous classifications ( 19% as seen in table 1 ) is relatively robust against the chosen magnitude limit for our sample . for instance , the agn fraction increases only slightly , from 19% to 22% , over the magnitude range @xmath38 respectively .",
    "we have difficulty probing magnitudes which are brighter ( too few galaxies ) or dimmer ( the sample becomes very incomplete ) than these limits .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the sdss has a firm lower limit on the signal - to - noise ratio of any observed spectrum , which alleviates any concerns regarding the homogeneity of identifying emission lines in these spectra . to test this",
    ", we measure the mean signal  to  noise ratio for each of the different classification of galaxies in our sample and found that the passive population ( no emission lines greater than 2@xmath32 ) had the highest mean signal  to  noise of all the sub ",
    "samples , _",
    "i.e. _ , a mean s / n of 27.7 compared to a mean s / n of 23.8 for the agns and a mean s / n of 18.5 for the star  forming populations .",
    "therefore , these passive galaxies are truly passive as they possess the required signal  to  noise to detect the expected emission lines seen in agns , llagns and star - forming galaxies . the elu galaxies ( @xmath39% of all galaxies in our sample ) have a mean signal  to  noise ratio of 24.8 .",
    "therefore , in terms of our galaxy classifications , our total galaxy sample is 66% complete ( in classifications ) , with the remaining third of galaxies being classified as elu galaxies .",
    "we will discuss these elu galaxies in section [ elu ] .      for two  thirds of our sample",
    ", we have a robust classification of an agn , passive and star  forming galaxy .",
    "for example , the two statistical methods used to identify agns and star  forming galaxies produce similar fractions . the first method , which is common in the literature , is less conservative than our fdr method , and produces a slightly larger sample of agns",
    ". however , the differences are marginal , indicating that our galaxy classifications are robust to the method used and the errors on the line measurements . the agn classifications are thus robust against the exact classification of the transition objects .",
    "therefore , for the remainder of the paper , we use the @xmath29 line method to classify our galaxies to remain consistent with the previous literature .",
    "we have compared our agn classification to those using template - fitting techniques ( _ e.g. _ , coziol et al .",
    "1998 ) and find excellent agreement ( see figure [ fig::llagn ] ) .",
    "this is due to our `` 2line '' method of classifying agns , which only requires the stronger   and   lines .",
    "finally , we have shown that stellar absorption does not strongly affect our classifications and that our classifications are free of any aperture bias .",
    "the remaining third of our sample is unclassified and could be affected by measurement error , stellar absorption and classification technique .",
    "we make no attempt to individually classify these galaxies , but instead statistically model their distributions ( see section [ elu ] ) .",
    "in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] , we plot the fraction of galaxies in each of our classifications ( star  forming , passive , agn , elu ) as a function of the projected local galaxy density , which is identical to that used , and described , in gomez et al .",
    "briefly , this projected local galaxy density is determined from the distance to the @xmath5 nearest projected neighbor ( within our pseudo volume  limited sample ) within a redshift shell of @xmath40 centered on the central galaxy .",
    "we then convert this surface density ( within the redshift shell ) into a local projected galaxy density .",
    "this approach is adaptive as the width of the smoothing kernel changes as a function of the local density and has the advantage , over a fixed width kernel density estimator , of having a constant signal  to ",
    "noise for all environments .",
    "we show in figure [ fig::bias ] that our density estimates are robust against choices of the size of the redshift shell and independent of redshift .",
    "figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] shows the expected decrease in the fraction of star  forming galaxies in dense regions and the increase in the fraction of passive galaxies in dense environments .",
    "these relations are analagous to sfr  density and morphology  density relations of gomez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) respectively .",
    "figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] confirms an earlier analysis by cfgkm who used an entirely different dataset and data - reduction procedure . as in cfgkm , we find that the agn fraction is constant over the two orders of magnitude in local galaxy density probed by this work , _",

    ", we can only rule out a constant agn fraction at the 46% level ( i.e. , a constant agn fraction can not be ruled out for this data ) . on the other hand , we can rule out a constant star - forming fraction at the @xmath4199.9999%   level , and a constant fraction of passive galaxies is ruled out at the 99.999%   level .",
    "we have looked at this statistic using only 2line or 4line agns as defined above and also find that the a mean constant fraction can not be ruled out for the either of these subsets of agns .",
    "we can restate this result in that the dip in the inner - most bin of the agn fraction seen in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] ( left ) is not significant .",
    "we note that there are a significant number of elus in this bin , which must be classified as either star - forming or agn . in the next section ,",
    "we address how the elu galaxies might contribute to the agn and star  forming fractions .",
    "unfortunately , in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] , 34% of our galaxy sample remains unclassified as either an agn or star  forming galaxy ; these are the elu galaxies discussed in section [ identify ] and their fraction as a function of density is shown in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] .",
    "these elu galaxies can not be passive as , by definition , they contain at least one significantly detected emission line ( @xmath29 ) . in this section ,",
    "we first try and classify as many of these elu galaxies as possible using the available spectroscopic information .",
    "then , for the remaining elu galaxies , we statistically model their contribution to the agn and star  forming fractions seen in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] , using only our current knowledge of the environmental dependence of star  forming galaxies .",
    "we discuss here a technique for classifying elu galaxies based on the combination of detected ( @xmath29 ) emission lines and upper limits on the non  detected emission lines ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "for example , most of the elu galaxies in fact have @xmath29 detections of both the   and   emission lines , but are missing detections of the weaker   and   lines .",
    "these galaxies were not classified as agns , using the 2line method discussed in section [ identify ] , as their observed /   line ratio was below the threshold required for them to be unambiguous 2line agn detections ( see section [ identify ] where we defined log(/)@xmath30 as the threshold ) .",
    "however , for these elu galaxies , we can make a reasonable estimate of their classification using the observed upper limits on the fluxes of the   and   emission lines .",
    "the flux upper limits on these missing lines is taken to be twice the measured flux error on that line , as this is our criteria for considering a line as detected , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath29 .    by using a combination of upper limits and",
    "detected emission lines , we compute the line ratios for these elu galaxies and place them on the usual diagnostic diagram ( figure [ fig::diagnostic ] ) . if the elu galaxies lie below the model in figure [ fig::diagnostic ] ,",
    "then it is reasonable to assume that these galaxies are star  forming , as the true values for the missing   and/or   emission lines must be smaller than their upper limits , which would move the galaxies further into the star  forming region of figure [ fig::diagnostic ] .",
    "we have used this technique to classify a further 230 of 1651 elu galaxies as star  forming , bringing the fraction of star  formation galaxies in our sample to 26% ( up from 21% in table 1 ) .",
    "all of these additional 230 galaxies were not originally classified using the 4line method because they were missing a detection of the   line ( which is a good indicator of agn activity ) .",
    "these 230 star - forming galaxies have a significantly smaller median h(@xmath36 ) ew of @xmath43 , compared to a median h(@xmath36 ) ew of @xmath44 for the 4line classified star - forming galaxies , _ i.e. _ , they have on average lower sfrs .    likewise , we can classify elu galaxies using the upper limits on any missing   and/or emission lines , and detections of the   and   emission lines . in this case , if the observed line ratios for such elu galaxies place them above the model in figure [ fig::diagnostic ] , then it is reasonable to assume that these elu galaxies contain an agn , as the true value of   and/or   is smaller than the upper limit thus forcing the galaxy further into the agn region of figure [ fig::diagnostic ] . using this methodology we classify an additional 40 elu galaxies as agns , bringing the agn fraction up slightly to 20% .",
    "all of these galaxies were previously missed because of weak   emission , which is a good indicator of recent star  formation .",
    "using these new techniques , based upon the upper limits of missing lines , we have reduced the fraction of elu galaxies from 34% to 28% of all galaxies in our sample . in the next section , we statistically model the classifications of the remaining elu galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] shows that @xmath45 of galaxies in the densest environments are elu galaxies .",
    "these elu galaxies are either an agn or star  forming .",
    "it is now well established using complete galaxy samples that the median sfr of galaxies in the cores of clusters is low , and that the fraction of star  forming galaxies is also low ( see gomez et al .",
    "2003 ; cfgkm ) . therefore",
    ", it is likely that most of the elu galaxies in dense environments are agns , and not star  forming . under this assumption , we can statistical model these elu galaxies and assign most of them in dense regions to our agn fraction . in creating this model ,",
    "we first measure the fraction of unambiguous star  forming galaxies over the total number of unambiguous star  forming galaxies plus agns , versus density . since the agn fraction does not vary with density , the slope of this fraction versus density is identical to the slope of the star  forming fraction versus density ( shown in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] ) .",

    "forming versus density , is shown as the dash - dot line in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] .",
    "we then add this modeled fraction of star  forming and agn elu galaxies , as a function of density , to the existing fractions of unambiguously classified star - forming galaxies and agns ( from section [ identify ] and figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ] ) . in figure [ fig::agnfrc_dens ]",

    "before we interpret our results , it is fair to question the reliability of our empirical modeling .",
    "we test our model using the sdss photometric imaging data via the colors of our galaxies . in particular",
    ", we use the @xmath47 rest - frame color as an indicator of on  going star  formation , as the @xmath48-band flux from these galaxies will be dominated by young , massive stars ( see strateva et al .",
    "the colors also have the advantage of measuring the total spectral energy distribution of the whole galaxy ( we use petrosian magnitudes here ) and are therefore , unaffected by fiber aperture effects and stellar absorption problems . in figure",
    "[ fig::agn_color_hist ] , we show the distributions of color ( sdss @xmath47 ) for all galaxies in our sample . the star  forming and passive galaxy populations follow the expected trends , _",
    "i.e. _ , the star ",
    "forming galaxies are the bluest ( in @xmath47 ) galaxies in our sample , while the passive galaxies are the reddest . the agn population lie between these two populations ; redder than the star  forming galaxies , but slightly bluer than the passive galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig::agn_color_hist ] shows the distribution of color for the elu galaxies which could not be identified using upper limits on the missing emission line , _ i.e. _ , the sample of elu galaxies that we statistically classified .",
    "clearly , the bluer elu galaxies are likely to be star  forming , while the redder elu galaxies are likely agns as , by definition , their spectra contains at least one significant emission line . as a test of our classification methods ,",
    "we note that 90% of the 230 elu galaxies we classified as star  forming using the upper limits in section 3.1.1 have @xmath49 colors of @xmath50 , which is fully consistent with the observed colors of our unambiguously classified star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is strong confirmation that these elu galaxies are truly star  forming and the methods we employ are robust .",
    "we can also model the distribution of star  forming galaxies and agns in the elu galaxies by assuming that the color distribution for the fraction of unambiguous star  forming galaxies ( 4line method ) over all unambiguously classified galaxies , is correctly measured in our sample .",
    "this fraction is shown in figure [ fig::agn_color_model ] and simply states that nearly all galaxies with @xmath51 are star  forming galaxies , while above @xmath52 , nearly all our unambiguously classified galaxies possess an agn .",
    "we apply this model to the sample and show in figure [ fig::agn_color_hist ] ( right ) the resulting color distributions for our classifications .",
    "this model identifies 77% of the elu galaxies as agns , while the remaining 23% are identified as star  forming .",
    "these observed fractions , which are based solely on the total colors of these elu galaxies , are consistent with our model described above .    finally , we considered here the effects of dust extinction ( reddening ) on our observed color distributions . for example , dusty star ",
    "forming galaxies could mimic the colors of our unambiguously classified agns and would cause an over  estimation of the agn fraction in the elus galaxies . to quantify this problem , we use the bruzual & charlot ( 2001 ) spectral synthesis models to estimate the amount of dust extinction and metalicity required to redden the @xmath53 color of a star  forming galaxies such that it would be mis  classified by our methods as an agn .",
    "we begin by calculating the @xmath53 color for a @xmath54 star  burst galaxy 0.3 gigayears after its burst and with a dust extinction similar to that of our galaxy ( see charlot & longhetti 2001 for these parameters ) .",
    "the predicted @xmath53 color of such a galaxy is fully consistent with the observed @xmath53 colors of our star  forming galaxies ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we then increased the dust extinction , keeping all other parameters fixed , until we obtained the mean @xmath53 color observed for our agns .",
    "we find that we require an additional 4 magnitudes of dust extinction ( beyond that seen in our galaxy ) to result in a mis  classification of these star ",
    "forming elu galaxies .",
    "this is a large amount of extinction and is unlikely to affect 25% of bright galaxies in the local universe which are under  going active star  formation .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is highly unlikely that star ",
    "forming galaxies make up a large portion of the elu galaxies .      in this section",
    ", we study the fraction of agns in galaxies as a function of the morphology of the host galaxy .",
    "first , we utilize the inverse concentration index ( @xmath56 ) in the sdss @xmath57 band , which is defined to be @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is petrosian radius containing 50% of the light and @xmath60 is petrosian radius containing 90% of the light ( see stoughton et al .",

    "2003 ; hogg et al .",
    "we also find no _ agn  density _ relation for the early and late  type galaxies .",
    "these observations can be naturally understood under the hypothesis that the agn population is primarily tracing only the bulge component of galaxies .",
    "this hypothesis would explain why we see no dependence on local galaxy density , as most galaxies have a bulge , and why there is no correlation with morphological type , as the disk component is irrelevant to the existence of an agn .",
    "such a model would then suggest that star ",
    "formation in the disk of a galaxy is not driven by the presence of an agn , and vica versa .",
    "this hypothesis is also consistent with the fact that most of our agns appear to be redder in their overall @xmath53 color ) than known star  forming galaxies .",
    "if there were a strong relationship between the existence of an agn and the ability of a galaxy to form stars , we might expect the agn fraction to decrease with density , as the star - forming fraction is seen to descrease with density .",
    "our hypothesis is supported by the observations of ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and martini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who see a strong correlation between the properties of agns and the bulge of their host galaxies . furthermore .",
    "kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) observe that the mass of the central supermassive black hole in nearby galaxies is independent of the luminosity of the disk component of a galaxy and only correlates with the properties of the galactic bulge .",
    "this hypothesis is also consistent with the idea that agns ( including quasars ) were formed at the same epoch as the old stellar populations in the bulges of these galaxies ( cattaneo & bernardi 2003 ) .",
    "we should note however , that sub ",
    "populations of agns are known to be strongly correlated with the morphology of the host galaxy ; for example , seyfert galaxies preferentially reside in spirals and s0s , while radio  loud galaxies are predominantly elliptical galaxies ( see ivezic et al .",
    "therefore , these sub  populations of agns would follow the same density relations as their host galaxies , _ i.e. _ , the fraction of strongly star - forming galaxies in the cores of clusters is much lower than that seen in the field population .",
    "we will investigate such sub  populations of agns in our future work ; however it is intriguing to note that when the classifications of these sub ",
    "populations is ignored ( and we simply classify galaxies as agn or star  forming ) the total agn population becomes independent of local galaxy density .",
    "this indicates that the fraction of galaxies classified in these different sub  populations ( seyferts , liners _ etc .",
    "_ ) appear to fortuitously sum to a constant over two orders of magnitude in local density .",
    "our work strongly supports the hypothesis that the bulge of every luminous galaxy , regardless of its overall morphology and environment , contains a supermassive black hole ( bh ) which is fueling the agn ( see the discussion by kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) . in this model , the black holes , and their mass function ,",
    "is established at an early cosmological epoch , _",
    "e.g. _ , through early formation of the galactic bulges in these galaxies ( via merger events ) and each of these bulges was seeded by bh .",
    "this model was recently investigated by di matteo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using detailed hydrodynamical simulations to trace the growth and activity of supermassive black holes in galaxies .",
    "they found that a majority of the bh mass is accreted by @xmath77 and no further growth happens at later epochs , similar to proposed evolution of galactic bulges .",
    "they also found that the bh accretion rate ( bhar ) density evolution follows the sfr density evolution to z = 4 , but then drops rapidly after that epoch resulting in the bhar being 100 times lower than the sfr density by @xmath78",
    ". therefore , the bhar plays no role in the evolution of galaxies at low redshift . in the near future",
    ", we should be able to test such predictions using our data from the sdss .    under the assumption that every luminous galaxy in our sample contains a supermassive bh , the fraction of galaxies we observe with an agn ( @xmath79 ) must therefore be dependent upon the lifetime ( or `` duty cycle '' ) of agns ( or is dependent on the orientation of the torus surrounding the bh ) .",
    "for example , the interval of look  back time spanned by the redshift range of our sample is @xmath80 years ( from @xmath81 to @xmath82 ) .",
    "we note that our agn fraction shows no sign of changing with redshift over this small redshift interval .",
    "therefore , to explain a constant observed agn fraction of 40% , the average lifetime of these agns could be as high as @xmath83 years .",
    "this is longer than previous estimates of the lifetime of an agn , _",
    "e.g. _ , a few million years ( see martini et al .",
    "2002 ) , and is longer than the salpeter lifetime of @xmath84 years ( salpeter 1964 ) .",
    "however , it is more consistent with the estimates on the lifetime of quasars from quasar clustering measurements ( see haiman & hui 2001 ) . one explanation for this longer lifetime is that most of our agn detections are llagns , where the accretion rate onto the bh is lower than for a normal agn , thus prolonging the lifetime of the agn activity .",
    "alternatively , our agns may be experiencing several bursts of activity over the interval of look  back time probed by our sample , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the lifetime of the agn and @xmath87 are the number of bursts .",
    "if we assume @xmath88 years in agreement with previous observations and the salpeter time , then this implies @xmath89 bursts between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , these arguments are simply a re - statement of the fact that we see a high fraction of galaxies with an agn , so they must be a common phenomenon either because they live a long time , or burst many times . in either case ,",
    "our observed high fraction of galaxies with an agn appears inconsistent with a merger  driven model for the fueling of the agn ( gunn 1979 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2002 ) , as this would imply a high merger rate for local galaxies .",
    "we also see no dependence on environment , which would be expected if agn activity was primarily driven by galaxy mergers .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the fraction of galaxies that possess an agn as a function of both environment and galaxy type .",
    "we have used the early data release of the sloan digital sky survey to define a pseudo volume  limited sample which is brighter than @xmath90 , within a redshift range of @xmath91 . using these data",
    "we conclude :    * the overall fraction of galaxies with an agn is at least @xmath71 ( with an unambiguous classification ) , but maybe as high as @xmath92 if we have correctly modeled the unclassified emission line galaxies in our sample .",
    "this confirms the earlier observations by cfgkm and ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; * our results are robust against measurement error on the emission lines , stellar absorption and technique to classify galaxies ; * over two orders of magnitude , the fraction of galaxies with an agn is independent of the ( projected ) local galaxy density ( see cfgkm ) .",
    "this is in contrast to star  forming galaxies which are seen to decrease with density ( gomez et al .",
    "2003 ) and passive galaxies that increase with density ( dressler et al . 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , agns are unbiased tracers of the overall galaxy population ; * the agn fraction is also independent of the overall morphological type of the host galaxy , and therefore , there appears to be no overall relationship between the star ",
    "formation activity in the disk component of galaxies and the presence of an agn .",
    "a plausible interpretation of this result is that the agn phenomenon is related to the bulge component of galaxies , which is consistent with the hypothesis that a supermassive black hole resides in the bulge of all galaxies ( see kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) ; * the high fraction of galaxies with an agn suggests that the lifetime ( or `` duty  cycle '' ) of these agns is long , or that they burst often . using the interval in look  back time spanned by our sample , we estimate that the lifetime of agns is @xmath93 years , which is significantly longer than the salpeter time . alternatively ,",
    "if the lifetime of the agns is @xmath94 years , then these agn burst on average @xmath95 times between @xmath82 and @xmath81 . if the agn are merger",
    " driven , then this implies a very high merger rate which is inconsistent with other observations and models .",
