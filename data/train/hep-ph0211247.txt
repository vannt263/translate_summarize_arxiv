    "non - commutative quantum field theories ( ncqft ) @xcite arise in string / m theory by describing the low - energy excitations of d - branes in a background of `` em - like '' fields .",
    "numerous ideas originating in string theory have stimulated particle physics phenomenology .",
    "we can regard ncqft as yet another such example .",
    "ncqft gives rise to an interesting set of operators not yet explored and therefore not ruled out .",
    "these give rise to a rich phenomenology with testable differences between qft and ncqft @xcite . in this contribution we give a brief overview of ncqft phenomenology with an emphasis on limits that can be extracted at high energy @xmath5 colliders @xcite .",
    "the central idea of ncqft is that the conventional commuting coordinates are replaced with non - commuting space - time operators : @xmath10 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu } \\equiv { i\\over   { \\lambda_{nc}^2 } } c_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] here we adopt the hewett - petriello - rizzo parametrization @xcite where the overall scale , @xmath6 , characterizes the threshold where non - commutative ( nc ) effects become relevant and @xmath11 is a real antisymmetric matrix whose dimensionless elements are presumably of order unity .",
    "one might expect the scale @xmath6 to be of order the planck scale .",
    "however , given the possibility of large extra dimensions @xcite where gravity becomes strong at scales of order a tev , it is possible that nc effects could set in at a tev .",
    "we therefore consider the possibility that @xmath6 may lie not too far above the tev scale .",
    "we stress that the @xmath12 matrix is not a tensor since its elements are identical in all reference frames resulting in the violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "thus , ncqft violates lorentz invariance at @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath12-matrix can be parameterized , following the notation of @xcite , as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the @xmath15 are related to space - time nc and are defined by the direction of the background `` * e*-field '' .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath15 can be parameterized as @xmath16 likewise , the @xmath17 are related to the space - space non - commutativeness and are defined by the direction of the background `` * b*-field '' .",
    "they can be parameterized as @xmath18 in both cases @xmath19 defines the origin of the @xmath20 axis which we set to @xmath21 so that we can parametrize @xmath12 with the two angles @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the angles of the background `` * e*-field '' and `` * b*-field '' relative to the @xmath24-axis .",
    "since experiments are sensitive to the direction of the @xmath12-vectors an astronomical coordinate systems must be employed and events must be time stamped event by event .",
    "ncqft can be cast in the from of a conventional qft using two approaches : the seiberg - witten mapping @xcite and the weyl - moyal approach @xcite . in the moyal - weyl approach",
    "only @xmath25 lie algegras are closed under moyal brackets so that nc gauge theories are only based on @xmath25 groups and covariant derivatives can only be constructed for fields with @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast a ncsm has been developed using the sieberg - witten approach but it is non - renormalizable order by order .",
    "it is difficult to construct the ncsm but ncqed is well defined in the moyal - weyl approach .",
    "it is the simplest extension of the standard model so that we will focus our discussion on ncqed but note that others have studied the ncsm .",
    "this approach provides a testing ground for the ideas of ncqft .    to study the phenomenology of ncqed non - commuting coordinates are introduced and the lagrangian is then cast in terms of conventional commuting quantum fields @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to several modifications of the standard commuting qed .",
    "it introduces momentum dependent phase factors in the fermion - photon vertices and introduces new three and four - point photon vertices .",
    "these changes violate lorentz invariance .",
    "the hallmark signal is azimuthal dependencies in the cross sections in @xmath28 processes resulting from the existence of a preferred direction .",
    "we note another approach to non - commuting phenomenology is to consider lorentz violating operators such as @xmath29 to place limits on the scale noncommutativity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 operator acts like a @xmath31 interaction with @xmath32 fixed .",
    "the different sensitivities of cs and hg atomic clocks to external @xmath31 leads to the estimate of @xcite @xmath33  gev .",
    "the operator @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are nucleon wavefunctions , leads to a shift in nuclear magnetic moments .",
    "measurements of sidereal variation in hyperfine splittings in atoms gives @xmath36  gev @xcite .",
    "if one accepts these conclusions it is unlikely that colliders can probe nc phenomenology .",
    "the standard way out is the supposition that loop contributions might be cancelled by other new physics .",
    "some loop induced tests of non - commutative field theories are summarized in table 1 .    table 1 : loop induced tests of ncsm .",
    "0.2 cm    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "collider tests of non - commutative field theories have mainly concentrated on ncqed and by implication @xmath5 colliders . in this context a number of processes have been studied : compton scattering , @xmath37 @xcite , pair production , @xmath38 @xcite , pair annihilation @xmath39 @xcite , moller scattering , @xmath40 @xcite , bhabha scattering , @xmath41 @xcite , two photon scattering , @xmath42 @xcite , and higgs production , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the two processes @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite as they provide good examples of the behavior we expect in @xmath28 processes in general .",
    "we mention other processes @xcite where the analysis provides additional ingredients beyond what was done in these analysis .",

    "1 . there are two important differences between the non - commuting version of this process and sm qed .",
    "the first is that there are momentum dependent phases in the fermion - photon vertices and the second is the introduction of the third diagram which includes a tri - linear photon vertex .",

    "the first two terms in the cross section are the standard model result .",
    "the third term is the ncqed contribution which includes contributions from the fermion - photon phase factors as well as the diagram with the tri - linear photon vertex . the bilinear product in the phase factor is given by : @xmath53 this phase factor breaks lorentz invariance .",

    "the event rate is high with statistics that can exclude ncqed to a fairly high value of @xmath6 .",
    "note that the qed ( solid ) curve is actually a central qed value with @xmath59 bands ( assuming 500  fb@xmath46 of integrated luminosity ) .    to quantify the sensitivity to ncqed",
    ", we calculate the @xmath60 for the deviations between ncqed and the sm for a range of parameter values .",
    "we start by calculating statistical errors based on an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath46 .",
    "we consider two possibilities for systematic errors . in the first case",
    "we do not include systematic errors while in the second case we obtain limits by combining a 2% systematic error combined in quadrature with the statistical errors ; @xmath61 .",
    "the 2% systematic error is a very conservative estimate of systematic errors , for example the tesla tdr calls for only a 1% systematic error .",
    "we calculate the @xmath60 for the following obervables ; total cross sections , @xmath62 and @xmath20 angular distributions , binning the angular distributions into 20 bins in @xmath62 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the observable under consideration and the sum is over the bins of the angular distributions .",
    "@xmath65 represents a 95% c.l .",
    "deviation from qed , which we ll define as the sensitivity limit .",
    "the @xmath62 distribution consistently gives the highest exclusion limits on @xmath6 , regardless of @xmath66 and @xmath22 ( as long as @xmath67 , where , again , no limits are possible ) .",
    "we obtain limits of @xmath68 .",
    "the feyman diagrams contributing to compton scattering are shown in fig .",
    "the differential cross section is given by @xcite : @xmath69 the first two terms in the expression are the standard qed contribution , while the last term is due to ncqed effects .",

    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the usual mandelstam variables @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "choosing @xmath78 and @xmath79 , results in the following expression for the phase factor : @xmath80   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{x k \\sqrt{s}}{4 \\lambda_{nc}^2 }   [ - \\sin \\gamma \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi +   \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi + \\cos \\alpha ( 1 + \\cos \\theta ) ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the momentum fraction of the incident photon , @xmath82 is the magnitude of the 3-momentum of the final state photon , and @xmath83 and @xmath20 are the lab frame angles of the final state photon .",
    "choosing @xmath21 leaves us with two free parameters in addition to @xmath6 .",
    "compton scattering is sensitive to both space - space and space - time nc parts , probing @xmath23 in addition to @xmath22 .",
    "it therefore complements @xmath49 .",

    "the event rate is high , so there are enough statistics to probe ncqed up to a fairly high value of @xmath6 . again , the qed ( solid ) curve includes the central qed value and @xmath59 bands ( assuming 500  fb@xmath46 of integrated luminosity ) .",
    "5 shows the angular distributions @xmath89 for qed and ncqed with @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath90 , and @xmath66 = @xmath6 = @xmath91 .",

    "@xmath55    note that there is no @xmath20 dependence for @xmath92 since for this case both * e * and * b * are parallel to the beam direction .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath93 , * e * is perpendicular to the beam direction which is reflected in the strong oscillatory behavior in the @xmath20 distribution .",
    "we find typical limits of @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath55      in addition to pair creation and compton scattering other processes have been studied .",
    "similar results emerge through momentum dependent electron - photon vertices and in the case of pair annihilation , an additional diagram with the tri - linear photon vertex .",
    "similar patterns of azimuthal dependence are found .",
    "hewett , petriollo and rizzo studied bhabba scattering , moller scattering , and pair annihilation @xcite .",
    "they found that the azimuthal dependences could be enhanced by introducing stiffer cuts on the angle of the final state particles .",
    "there is a tradeoff between reduced statistics with this cut and an enhanced effect .",
    "however , the sensitivity is more likely to be limited by systematic errors than by statistical errors so the stiffer cuts seem a worthwhile possibility to pursue .    in our analysis we chose a specific terrestial reference frame to perform our calculations .",
    "this is a reasonable approach in a preliminary survey of the sensitivity to the nc scale .",
    "however , as we have repeatably pointed out , the background fields remain fixed with respect to some universal direction .",
    "to perform a proper analysis one would have to account for the motion of the experiment with respect to some celestial reference frame .",
    "this would need a detailed knowledge of not only the location of the experiment with respect to the earth but knowledge of when events were collected .",
    "clearly this is beyond the scope of a simple theorist s estimate .",
    "however , along these lines , grosse and liao @xcite did a preliminary analysis studying day - night asymetries in @xmath95 production .",
    "to summarize , noncommutative field theory is a possibility whose phenomenology has received little attention . in this preliminary study we found that lepton pair production and compton scattering at high energy linear colliders are excellent processes to study non - commutative qed .",
    "the hallmark signature is the appearance of azimuthally dependent cross sections in @xmath28 processes .",
    "the pair production process is only sensitive to space - time nc and is therefore insensitive to @xmath23 . as @xmath22 increases towards @xmath86 the deviations from sm decrease towards zero , with @xmath90 being identical to the sm .",
    "on the other hand , the compton scattering process is sensitive to both space - space and space - time nc as parametrized by @xmath23 and @xmath22 . on the whole",
    ", we found that the compton scattering process is superior to lepton pair production in probing ncqed . despite significantly smaller statistics ,",
    "the large modification of angular distributions leads to higher exclusion limits , well in excess of the center of mass energy for all colliders considered .",
