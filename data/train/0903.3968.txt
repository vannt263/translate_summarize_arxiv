    "the `` ribbon '' structures of solar flares have long been observed at chromospheric lines ( e.g , h@xmath0  at 656.3  nm and caii  h  at 396.8  nm ) .",
    "a ribbon in one magnetic polarity region has its counterpart in the other magnetic polarity region , and both run parallel to the magnetic polarity inversion line lying between them .",
    "the well - observed separation motion of ribbons is a direct mapping of energy release via magnetic reconnection in the corona reconnecting current sheet ( rcs ) @xcite , the rate of which can be evaluated as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the corresponding magnetic field component perpendicular to the surface ribbon element @xmath3 . under a simplified two - dimensional reconnection model @xcite , the electric potential drop , @xmath4 , along coronal separator with length element @xmath5 equals the reconnection rate @xmath6 . by considering that the coronal separator has the same length as flare ribbon , the electric field",
    "can thus be expressed as @xmath7 , where u is the ribbon expansion velocity .",
    "this enables the determination of the electric field at the rcs through observable quantities in the lower atmosphere , while large uncertainties may be induced in evaluating @xmath8 especially for ribbons with irregular shape .",
    "alternatively , we infer the _ average _ electric field used in the present study as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the length of ribbon , and the `` @xmath11 '' and `` @xmath12 '' subscript denote the corresponding physical quantity measured for the ribbons located in the positive and negative magnetic fields , respectively . in this way , the reconnection rate @xmath6 can be calculated essentially based on progression of ribbon intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , reconnecting magnetic fluxes from positive and negative magnetic fields should be identical in principle ; however , their actual measurements do not always yield a good balance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the average value of @xmath13 , as defined above , may be able to represent the overall strength of reconnection electric field at the rcs , which is regarded as conceptually the most straightforward mechanism to directly accelerate electrons to high energies @xcite .",
    "a powerful diagnostic of accelerated energetic electrons produced by flares is the hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission , the spectrum of which often appears as a power - law distribution in photon energy [ @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the hardness of x - ray emission , i.e. , the power - law spectral index @xmath15 , implies a characteristic in the energy distribution of the electron flux bombarding the dense target under the bremsstrahlung emission mechanism @xcite .",
    "specifically , a harder x - ray spectrum ( with smaller spectral index ) indicates that more electrons are accelerated to higher energies . for this study",
    ", x - ray spectrum is measured for entire flaring region on the solar disc , thus the derived spectral index reflects the overall hardness of x - ray emission ( thereafter referred as @xmath16 ) created by downward traveling accelerated electrons impinging on the chromosphere .",
    "previous studies of temporal evolution of reconnection electric field @xmath13 and hxr spectral index @xmath15 in individual flares show that they are correlated and anti - correlated , respectively , with that of the hxr flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which naturally suggests an anticorrelation relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is also hinted by particle simulations with prescribed electric and magnetic fields @xcite , which show that the electron energy spectrum hardens when the electric field increases . a direct comparison of @xmath13 and @xmath15 using observational data is thus needed to bridge the research of magnetic reconnection and electron acceleration , which is believed to have an intrinsic causal relationship .",
    "in retrospect , only a single such attempt has been reported .",
    "it was the 2005 may 13 m8.0 flare with ribbon - like hxr emissions @xcite , where spatially resolved @xmath13 and @xmath15 determined by tracing each position along ribbon and imaging spectroscopy for each pixel , respectively , can be compared @xcite .",
    "as ribbon - like hxr sources are not often observed , in this letter , we take a different approach and investigate the relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath16 using a sample of 13 two - ribbon flares .",
    "the chosen flares were all well observed on the disk with an orientation cosine factor of @xmath180.7 ( @xmath1946@xmath20  from the disc center ) , exhibiting clear motion of ribbon separation with nearly full coverage of x - ray observations from the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _  ( _ rhessi _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "ribbon observations at h@xmath0  and caii  h  spectral line were acquired by the global h@xmath0  network @xcite ( 10 events ) , the solar optical telescope ( sot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on _ hinode _  ( 2 events ) , and the usaf / optical solar patrol network ( ospan , formerly known as isoon ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( 1 event ) .",
    "these images have a cadence of 0.52 minutes and a pixel resolution of @xmath180.11 . for the sake of consistency",
    ", we use photospheric magnetic fields of the flaring region ( @xmath182  pixel@xmath21 ) measured with the michelson doppler imager  ( mdi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",

    "figure  [ fig1]@xmath23 shows an h@xmath0  image near the flare peak time superimposed with x - ray sources .",
    "this is a typical two - ribbon flare , with part of h@xmath0  ribbons occupied by hxr emitting sources ( 2550  kev ) and a lower energy x - ray source ( 1225  kev ) lying in - between .",
    "we developed a standardized procedure to derive the reconnection electric field from ribbon motion .",
    "modules of this procedure include accurate image alignment , appropriate image destretching for ground - based observation , ribbon tracking using the intensity - based binary masks method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ribbon length estimation , and registering h@xmath0  images on the corresponding magnetogram by multiple feature matching .",
    "we consider uncertainties in this method that mainly stem from the following aspects : ( 1 ) the choice of the cutoff value that defines the brightened ribbons .",
    "we first determine a central cutoff value at the evolving edge of the ribbon based on the difference images relative to a fixed preflare frame .",
    "we then vary this central cutoff value within @xmath2220% and use 11 thresholds in total to characterize the brightened ribbons at each time interval , in order to have a better evaluation of the reconnection rate ; ( 2 ) magnetic field measurement .",
    "mdi level 1.8 full - disk magnetograms are used , and a largest noise level of 30  g is taken into account . since mdi magnetogram could be affected by high energy emissions during flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use magnetograms just before the flares for calculation .",
    "we note that it is known that mdi data could suffer from zeeman saturation , and the level 1.5 data could underestimate the flux density by a factor of @xmath180.640.69 @xcite .",
    "however , in most of our studied events , the regions swept by flare ribbons are not obviously affected by zeeman saturation , and the values of level 1.8 calibrated field density are @xmath181.6 times those of the uncalibrated level 1.5 data .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the inherent limitations in mdi measurement to significantly alter out results ; and ( 3 ) ribbon length estimation .",
    "we measure the length of the brightened ribbons as defined above . while as the shape of flare ribbons may not be regular and actual flare process may take place in a more complicated three - dimensional structure ( see more discussion in   [ discussion ] ) , we take an error of 30% in ribbon length measurement . moreover , caution has been taken when there is a complicated ribbon dynamics , only later stage of which exhibits classical separation motion and can be regarded as complying with the standard two - dimensional model ( e.g. , the 2003 october 29 x10 flare ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus in such cases ( indicated in table  [ tbl1 ] ) , we extract results only from the clear ribbon separation phase .",
    "figure  [ fig1]@xmath24 depicts front of the x2.6 flare ribbons as color - coded lines using a central brightness cutoff value , which shows clearly the ribbon separation motion in opposite magnetic fields .",
    "the computed @xmath17 ( _ red _ ) is plotted in figure  [ fig1]@xmath25 .",
    "its peak ( @xmath189.2  v  cm@xmath21 ) is co - temporal with that of the hxr emission in 25 - 50  kev ( _ black _ ) , which is previously found in other events @xcite .    for analysis of x - ray spectrum",
    ", we used the object spectral executive ( ospex ) software package and applied the pileup correction , if necessary , in solarsoftware ( ssw ) .",
    "we set the energy bin width to 1/3 kev , the standard finest binning , and choose the length of fitting time interval to be the same as the cadence of ribbon images centering on the time of each frame , except in the case that we have to avoid the time when _ rhessi _",
    "attenuators change status .",
    "we model the thermal plasma and high - energy emissions with an isothermal component and nonthermal power - law distributions , respectively . quite often ,",
    "the nonthermal emission is best fitted using a double power - law function with two different spectral indices . in such a case , we take the spectral index reflecting the hardness of photons with medium energies ( @xmath182050  kev ) as the result for that event ( see discussion in   [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the values of hxr spectral index may arise from the choice of the length of fitting interval and spectrum background , and is estimated to be @xmath185% .",
    "the x - ray spectral fitting results of the x2.6 flare around its peak time is shown in figure  [ fig1]@xmath27 , where @xmath16 reaches @xmath182.46 in @xmath182060  kev . the time profile of @xmath16 ( _ blue _ ) is plotted in figure  [ fig1]@xmath25 , in comparison with those of @xmath17 and the 2550  kev photon flux . as usual , the minimum overall spectral index occurs when the hxr peaks , which is believed to be an intrinsic feature of electron acceleration in the flare impulsive phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following similar procedure , we calculate reconnection electric field and hxr spectral index for other events , and give the results in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the maximum @xmath17 and the minimum @xmath16 lie in the range of @xmath18120  v  cm@xmath21  and @xmath1828 , respectively , which is generally comparable with what previously reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a majority of events , the times when @xmath17 and @xmath16 reach the maximum and minimum values , respectively , agree within one minute .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] ( _ top _ ) shows the scatter plot of these two quantities , with a value of logarithmic correlation coefficient ( cc ) computed to be @xmath120.94 .",
    "that is to say , a larger electric field in the rcs corresponds to a harder x - ray spectrum ( with smaller @xmath15 ) and presumably to a harder electron precipitation spectrum , which is qualitatively consistent with the trend predicted by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this high correlation relationship thus strongly support the hypothesis that direct acceleration by the electric field generated by magnetic reconnection may play an important role in producing energetic electrons in flares .",
    "we note that x , m , and c - class flares appear to be three populations , which indicates that flares with larger magnitude are almost always associated with larger electric fields and harder hxr spectra .",
    "this tendency is more clearly seen in figure  [ fig2 ] ( _ bottom _ ) , where we make scatter plot of the maximum @xmath17 versus the peak flux in 18    soft x - ray measured by the _ geostationary operational environmental satellite _",
    "( _ goes _ ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the logarithmic cc also has a high coefficient of 0.97 for all the data sets .",
    "this further implies that larger electric field strength may be responsible for stronger electron acceleration and hence stronger high - energy emissions seen in flares with larger magnitude .",
    "joining the research of magnetic reconnection and electron acceleration , we have determined the average electric field @xmath17 in the rcs and the overall hardness of x - ray emission @xmath16 from flare observations of 13 events .",
    "we then find a strong correlation relationship between both the minimum @xmath16 and the flare magnitude corresponding to the maximum @xmath17 .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the clearest direct observational evidence obtained so far of electron acceleration by reconnection electric field in solar flares , which has long been explored but mostly by theoretical models @xcite .",
    "we discuss the present results with related observation and simulation works .",
    "the present research is closest to that of @xcite , who compared spatially resolved electric field and hxr spectral index for a single event . in their result , an anticorrelation relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath15 is also found , while for the @xmath13 with similar strength , the corresponding @xmath15 generally has smaller values than that in our study .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that different from the average @xmath13 and the overall @xmath15 herein presented , they explored the local electric field by tracing motion of every position along ribbon , and local spectral index in each pixel by applying an imaging spectroscopy technique .",
    "a larger error could be induced in calculating such @xmath13 and @xmath15 , but it is more possible that different approach , i.e. , global or local , matters in studying the flare energy release . in another study , @xcite found that @xmath28 is anti - correlated with @xmath15 in two flares .",
    "however , one of their event is close to limb ( with a cosine factor of @xmath180.49 ) , and they used ribbon observations in 1600    that forms in upper chromosphere and transition region .",
    "more importantly , instead of @xmath28 , @xmath13 is believed to be the physical quantity directly associated with electron acceleration .",
    "previous studies of reconnection electric field usually use the form , @xmath7 , while @xmath8 is not easy to be measured accurately ( cf .",
    "we use another form , @xmath29 , where @xmath28 can be evaluated in detail using ribbon intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we must note that the ribbon length @xmath10 is an invariable in the standard two - dimensional model ; however , it usually involves rapidly during actual flares especially in the early phase .",
    "although chromospheric ribbons may be regarded as an instantaneous response of energy release in the coronal current sheet through precipitation of accelerated electrons , recent observational studies have suggested the requirement of consideration of three - dimensional magnetic structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the deviation from the standard two - dimensional model is also implied by the asymmetry of flare geometry . for the studied events , the ratio of reconnection electric field and ribbon length measured in opposite magnetic field regions ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , generally falls into the range of @xmath180.22 and 0.33 , respectively . without an applicable three - dimensional flare model , we thus use the equation in ",
    "[ introduction ] as an approximation , where we measure the length of ribbon when it fully developed and treat it as a constant .",
    "this simplification may be justified , because most of our events do not show a significant change of ribbon length at times when the maximum @xmath17 and the minimum @xmath16 occur .",
    "using the time - dependent change of ribbon length as a probe to the magnetic reconnection process is an area of on - going research ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our observational results demonstrate that there exists a remarkable anticorrelation relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with model results @xcite , in that both indicate a hardening of electron energy distribution with increasing electric field strength .",
    "quantitatively comparison is beyond the scope of this study , as further assumptions need to be made before numerical results of electron spectra can be compared with observed photon spectra .",
    "an important issue is that in the simulation of @xcite , it is found that the accelerated electrons exhibit not only a power - law energy spectrum but also an exponential tail at the high energy end .",
    "the latter indicates that diffuse shock acceleration may be at work .",
    "therefore we take only the spectral indices of the hxrs with medium energies as the results , when the spectrum can not be fitted using a single power - law function .",
    "this also implies that different acceleration mechanisms may all contribute to electron acceleration during flares @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of such clear correlations of observational signatures provides strong support for electron acceleration models based on electric field generated at the rcs .",
