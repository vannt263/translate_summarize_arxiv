    "alfvn waves or more generally transverse magneto - hydrodynamic waves would play a key role in coronal heating and solar wind acceleration ( e.g. suzuki & inutsuka , 2006 ) .",
    "numerous studies about generation , propagation and dissipation of the alfvn waves have been carried out observationally and theoretically ( e.g. ryutova & priest , 1993 ) .",

    "it is poorly known how much alfvn - wave flux generated in the photosphere is propagated all the way to the corona through the fanning - out flux tubes .",
    "high - quality observations to obtain spectra of magnetic fluctuation is of crucial importance to understand coronal heating and acceleration of fast solar wind .",

    "he suggested that the observed phase relation between the magnetic field and the velocity perturbation is consistent with the outgoing alfvn waves .",
    "the observing aperture of @xmath21 is , however , very large compared with the spatial scale of the flux tubes along which the alfvn waves propagate .",

    "redi & cally ( 2003 ) suggested that most of the observed magnetic field oscillations is due to the opacity effect caused by temperature and density fluctuations associated with magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "recently apparent transverse oscillations , which are clear evidence of the alfvn waves , are detected in prominence ( okamoto et al . 2007 ) , in spicules ( de pontieu et al .",

    "( 2007 ) using the _ coronal multi - channel polarimeter _ without magnetic field information .",
    "we stress that the observations of the magnetic field fluctuation with the simultaneous velocity and photometric measurement allows us to identify propagating hydromagnetic waves .",
    "the literatures so far introduced are mainly concerned with the pure alfvn waves .",
    "the magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere have a form of isolated magnetic flux tubes embedded in a nearly field - free fluid .",
    "such flux tubes carry the incompressible torsional alfvn waves , and the linearly polarized alfvn waves can exist only in the uniform media .",
    "the flux tubes also carry the kink waves ( transverse waves ) and the sausage waves ( longitudinal waves ) ( e.g. stix , 2002 ) instead of the linearly - polarized alfvn waves .",
    "magnetic tension force of the flux tube is the restoring force in the kink mode ( e.g. spruit , 1981 ) , and is essentially incompressible .",
    "the sausage mode with the azimuthal wave number m = 0 , as first defined by defouw ( 1976 ) and discussed e.g. in roberts and webb ( 1978 ) and ryutova ( 1981 ) , is related to a _ slow _ magnetoacoustic mode . in the sausage - shaped perturbed boundary of the flux tube , where the flux - tube area increases ,",
    "the magnetic field decreases , whereas the plasma pressure increases ; vice versa .",
    "a fast magneto - acoustic mode propagates across the flux tube , and is not localized radially in the vicinity of the flux tube ; we do not regard this as a mode of flux tube oscillations . in this paper",
    ", we report a clear detection of magnetic , velocity and photometric oscillations of the magnetic flux tubes with the spectro - polarimeter ( sp ) of sot . the data is extensively analyzed in terms of both the linearly - polarized kink waves and the slow sausage waves , while we will not discuss the torsional alfvn waves due to our constraint in the analysis as we explain later .",
    "sot / sp is ideally suited to detect the magneto - hydrodynamic waves propagated along the flux tubes due to its high spatial and time resolution and its high polarimetric and photometric precision ( e.g. ploner @xmath24 solanki , 1997 ) .",
    "sot / sp obtains two spectra of iron lines ( fe i ) with wavelengths of 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm , which are suitable for observing lower photosphere ( del toro iniesta , 2003 ) .",
    "earlier studies about magnetic fluctuations were done in sunspot umbra , since small - scale flux tube ( @xmath25 ) fluctuations might be difficult to detect .",
    "the high spatial resolution of _ hinode _ ( @xmath26 ) allows us to detect the fluctuations in such small - scale flux tubes .",
    "furthermore , stable observations from space allow us to detect clear intensity fluctuations for the first time , and to obtain the phase relations among the fluctuations in the magnetic flux , the velocity , and the intensity .",
    "this allows us to examine the opacity effect more in detail .    for the detection of weak magnetic fluctuations ,",
    "we prefer to use the stokes v signal instead of the stokes q or u signal because of its much higher sensitivity to magnetic flux .",
    "we , thus , intentionally choose magnetic concentrations located away from the disk center to observe possible fluctuation of the transverse magnetic field in the stokes v signal and the associated velocity signal .",
    "we estimate the magnetic field fluctuation associated with the alfvn waves to be about @xmath27 g by substituting typical values for the photosphere ( magnetic field strength of a flux tube @xmath28 g , alfvn speed @xmath29 km s@xmath4 , and velocity fluctuation",
    "@xmath30 km s@xmath4 ) to the relation about the alfvn wave @xmath31 ( e.g. priest 1981 ) .",
    "a detection limit of the longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields observed by the sot is known to be 1 - 5 g and 30 - 50 g , respectively ( tsuneta et al .",
    "this exercise demonstrates that the sot / sp can detect the transverse mhd waves in the stokes v signal with high signal - to - noise ratio , if such mhd waves are present in the photosphere .",
    "the data used in this paper was taken on 2007 february 3 @xmath0 5 .",
    "the region that we observed was noaa 10940 , which moved from west 25.2 to 49.0 degrees in longitude during the course of the observation .",
    "the region consists of pores and magnetic flux concentrations located in the inter - granular lanes ( ishikawa et al . , 2007 ) , which we hereafter call inter - granular magnetic structure ( ims ) .",
    "the integration time is 4.8 s , and the field of view is 1.92 ( ew ) by 81.92 ( ns ) .",
    "the pixel size is 0.16 .",
    "periodic scanning was done by the sot / sp for 1 hour or 3 hours depending on the flux tubes with cadence of 67 s. this time resolution allows us to detect magnetohydrodynamic waves with a period longer than 134 s according to the nyquist criteria .",
    "we analyzed 14 magnetic flux concentrations as tabulated in table [ table1 ] .",
    "all these magnetic flux concentrations are of positive polarity ( magnetic field vector toward the observer ) .",
    "the region # 05 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as an example of the data .",
    "the region # 05 contains a pore in a plage region .",
    "we use the stokes i and v profiles of the fe i 630.25 nm line to derive the line - of - sight velocity , the line - of - sight magnetic flux , and the intensity .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity fluctuation @xmath32 is derived by measuring the stokes v zero cross position @xmath33 .",
    "the stokes v profiles reflect the motion of the magnetic atmosphere better than the stokes i profiles , which also contain the information of the non - magnetic atmosphere .",
    "the line - of - sight magnetic flux fluctuation ( @xmath34 ) is derived with the help of weak field approximation ( landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) rather than relying on the standard milne - eddington inversion ( e.g. del toro iniesta 2003 ) .",
    "the milne - eddington least - squares fit is performed to the observed stokes profiles of the fe i 630.15 nm and fe i 630.25 nm with 12 parameters , which may be subject to noise that impedes the detection of fluctuation with amplitude as small as @xmath35 % . in the weak field approximation ,",

    "the intrinsic magnetic field strength @xmath49 and the filling factor @xmath50 are derived from the milne - eddington inversion to accurately determine the alfvn speed . the intrinsic magnetic field strength @xmath51 is used only for this purpose .",
    "the filling factor is defined as the fraction of area occupied with the magnetic field in a pixel ( orozco surez et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the 12 free parameters are intrinsic field strength @xmath49 , inclination and azimuth for magnetic field vector , line strength , doppler width , damping factor , doppler velocity , source function , source gradient , macro turbulence , filling factor ( stray - light factor ) , and the doppler shift of the stray - light profile .",
    "we should track the region of interest ( roi ) , for which the wave analysis is performed , in a lagrangian way for an extended period of time . in the case of pores , the overall magnetic structure",

    "the physical parameters are averaged inside the roi .",
    "on the other hand , imss are generally not maintained for 1 hour : magnetic elements may combine , split , or decay within a time period of several tens of minutes .",
    "thus , we set the roi in this case large enough to encompass the entire magnetic flux concentration in the spatial and temporal domain , and average the physical parameters of the pixels with @xmath36 larger than 0.01 inside the roi . the size of the rois for imss is typically 1@xmath52 1to 2@xmath52 4 .",

    "they concluded that the observed fluctuations in magnetic field strength is mainly caused by the opacity effect .",
    "temperature and density fluctuations associated with the propagation of a hydrodynamic ( acoustic ) or magneto - hydrodynamic ( magneto - acoustic ) wave may cause the opacity fluctuation that moves the line formation layer upward or downward , resulting in an apparent magnetic field fluctuation , if the magnetic field has a gradient with geometrical height @xmath59 .",
    "this is called the opacity effect .    in this section ,",
    "we consider whether the observed fluctuation is due to the opacity effect .",
    "the photometric intensity that we observe is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the local temperature at the optical depth @xmath62 .",
    "the intensity modulation can take place due either to change in the temperature or to change in the optical depth , which depends on the density and the temperature in the optical path .",
    "the opacity effect involves the second term ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "fluctuation in intensity indicates a compressive nature of the fluctuation due to the first term ( @xmath64 ) and/or to the second term ( @xmath63 ) in eq .",

    "thus , waves with low intensity fluctuation , especially those with an intensity fluctuation close to zero , can be considered to be a incompressible mode ( such as the kink mode ) , while those with high intensity fluctuation can be considered to be a compressible mode ( such as the sausage mode ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] show the histograms of the line core @xmath65 and the continuum @xmath66 intensity fluctuations normalized by the average intensity @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; @xmath69 ( core fluctuation ) and @xmath70 ( continuum fluctuation ) for all the peaks .",
    "the relation between the core and the continuum fluctuations is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] shows that phase difference between the intensity fluctuation in the core and in the continuum , @xmath72 , has a concentration at around @xmath73 .",
    "we here consider the opacity effect due either to the density or to the temperature fluctuations .",
    "first we assume only the density fluctuation ( without the temperature fluctuation ) . magnetic field strength is smaller with height ( @xmath74 ) because of the canopy structure of magnetic flux tubes .",
    "since the observations are carried out with 25.2 to 49 degrees away from the normal , we simply assume here that the magnetic field strength along the line of sight decreases with height in the following discussion .",
    "the temperature is lower with height below the temperature minimum .",
    "when the atmosphere in the line formation layer is compressed ( or decompressed ) , the line formation layer moves upward ( downward ) , because the opacity along the line of sight in the flux tube increases ( decreases ) .",
    "when the line formation layer moves upward ( or downward ) , both the magnetic field strength and the intensity decrease ( increase ) . therefore , the observed magnetic field strength and the constant - temperature intensity fluctuation caused by the opacity effect should have had the phase difference of @xmath75 , while the observed phase differences @xmath76 have a concentration at around @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the observed phase difference is not consistent with that caused by the opacity effect , if the opacity effect is caused only by the density fluctuation without temperature fluctuation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the line formation layer may be compressed ( or decompressed ) under the adiabatic condition .",
    "we here consider the opacity effect due to temperature , assuming that the optical depth @xmath62 depends only on the temperature .",
    "the dominant absorber in the visible wavelengths is the h@xmath77 ion ( e.g. stix , 2002 ) .",
    "the populations of h@xmath77 and hi are related with the saha equation ( rutten 1995 , eq . ( 8.2 ) ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the electron pressure , @xmath80 the electron temperature , @xmath81 the ionization energy from h@xmath77 to h , @xmath82 and @xmath83 the population densities of h@xmath77 and hi , @xmath84 and @xmath85 the partition function of h@xmath77 and hi .",
    "equation ( [ equa10 ] ) indicates that the population of h@xmath77 depends highly on the temperature , and decreases with the temperature in the case of the adiabatic compression , while the population depends weakly on the pressure , and increases with the pressure in the constant temperature case .",
    "thus , we can not determine the population of h@xmath77 in the actual situation without employing a model taken into account the radiation exchange between the inside and the outside of the flux tubes .",
    "we point out that regardless of mechanism to change the opacity , the phase difference between the fluctuations in the magnetic field and the intensity ( @xmath86 ) depends only on the sign of magnetic gradient along the line of sight when the line formation height moves upward or downward due to the lateral expansion and the contraction of the tube .",
    "the flux tubes that we observed were located 25.2 to 49.0 degrees away from the sun center . if the magnetic field strength decreases with height along the oblique line of sight , the phase difference between the fluctuations in the magnetic field and the intensity @xmath86 should have been @xmath75 , whereas we obtained @xmath87",
    ". therefore , the phase relation between the fluctuations in the magnetic field and the intensity from the observation would not be consistent with that caused by the opacity effect under the assumption of the decreasing field strength with height along the line of sight .",
    "if the effect of the adiabatic compression ( or decompression ; first term in equation ( [ equa8 ] ) ) is larger than the opacity effect due to the density and/or temperature fluctuation ( second term in equation ( [ equa8 ] ) ) , the phase difference between the magnetic field strength and the intensity fluctuation is @xmath75 for the case of the fast - mode wave , while that is @xmath13 for the case of the slow - mode wave .",
    "thus , we can rule out the fast - mode wave , since the observed phase difference is close to @xmath13 .",
    "in this chapter , we examine whether the observed properties of waves are consistent with the kink mode mhd waves ( fig . [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "though the magnetic and velocity fluctuations that we observe could be either parallel or perpendicular to the flux tubes , we here consider the possibility that the observed fluctuations are transverse to the magnetic field . as discussed in chapter 4 , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows that some of the fluctuations has very small intensity fluctuation .",
    "since the kink mode is essentially of non - compressive nature , those fluctuations with little intensity fluctuation may dominantly have properties of the kind mode .",
    "the dispersion relation of the kink mode neglecting gravitational stratification is given by ( e.g. spruit , 1981 ; edwin and roberts , 1983 , moreno - insertis , schssler , @xmath24 ferriz - mas , 1996 , ryutova & khijakadze , 1990 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the phase speed of the kink mode , @xmath90 the frequency , @xmath91 the wave number , @xmath92 the alfvn speed , @xmath93 the density inside the flux tube , and @xmath94 the density outside the flux tube .",

    "( [ equa11 ] ) @xmath0 ( [ equa13 ] ) , we obtain @xmath102 the phase relation of the kink mode is the same as that of the alfvn mode .",
    "magnetic field is directed away from the sun in our case .",
    "if the kink wave propagates to the direction same as that of magnetic field vector , minus sign should be taken , and vice versa . if a pure ascending or descending kink wave propagates toward the observer along magnetic field , phase difference between the magnetic field and the velocity fluctuations @xmath103 should , therefore , have been 180@xmath22 or 0@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that this is not the case .",
    "we then consider a superposition of the ascending kink wave and the descending waves , which is the reflected ascending wave at the photosphere - chromosphere boundary .",
    "when the ascending and the descending kink waves coexist in the line formation layer , the superposed wave form is determined by six variables @xmath104 , which indicate the amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuation ( @xmath105 ) , the amplitude of the velocity field fluctuation ( @xmath106 ) , and the initial phase ( @xmath107 ) of upward ( subscript @xmath108 ) and downward ( subscript @xmath109 ) waves .",

    "the region of interest encompasses the entire magnetic flux concentrations in the spatial and temporal domain ( i.e. in the case of imss ) , and we average the physical parameters inside the roi .",

    "magnetohydrodymanic waves are believed to play a vital role in the acceleration and heating of the fast solar wind .",

    "indeed , the upward poynting flux above the reflecting layer is estimated to be @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath4 in one case ( kink wave ) , and is by no means negligible flux in terms of heating and acceleration of the upper atmosphere .",
    "tsuneta et al ( 2008b ) conjectures that a rapid decrease in the magnetic field strength associated with the rapidly expanding flux tube near the chromosphere - corona boundary for the polar kg patches reduces the vertical change in alfvn speed , and the alfvnic cutoff frequency be lower in the polar flux tubes .",
    "magnetohydrodymanic waves generated in the photosphere may be more efficiently propagated to the corona through such fanning - out flux tubes with large expansion factor observed in the polar coronal holes . on the other hand , the observations presented here suggest significant reflected waves .",

    "<S> we report the observations of the magneto - hydrodynamic waves propagating along magnetic flux tubes in the solar photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we identified 20 isolated strong peaks ( 8 peaks for pores and 12 peaks for inter - granular magnetic structure ) in the power spectra of the l.o.s . </S>",
    "<S> ( line - of - sight ) magnetic flux , the l.o.s . </S>",
    "<S> velocity , and the intensity for 14 different magnetic concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the observation is performed with the spectro - polarimeter of the solar optical telescope aboard the _ hinode _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation periods are located in 3@xmath06 min for the pores and in 4@xmath09 min for the inter - granular magnetic elements . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks correspond to the magnetic , the velocity , and the intensity fluctuation in time domain with r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> ( root mean square ) amplitudes of @xmath1 g ( @xmath2 % ) , @xmath3 km s@xmath4 , and @xmath5% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> phase differences between the l.o.s . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic flux @xmath6 , the l.o.s . </S>",
    "<S> velocity @xmath7 , the intensities of the line core @xmath8 , and the continuum intensity @xmath9 have striking concentrations at around @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , around @xmath13 for @xmath14 , and around @xmath15 for @xmath16 . here , for example , @xmath17 means that the velocity leads the magnetic field by a quarter of cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the observed phase relation between the magnetic and the photometric intensity fluctuation would not be consistent with that caused by the opacity effect , if the magnetic field strength decreases with height along the oblique line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the observed fluctuations are due to longitudinal ( sausage mode ) and/or transverse ( kink mode ) mhd waves . </S>",
    "<S> the observed phase relation between the fluctuations in the magnetic flux and the velocity is consistent with the superposition of the ascending wave and the descending wave reflected at chromosphere / corona boundary ( standing wave ) . </S>",
    "<S> even with such reflected waves , the residual upward poynting flux is estimated to be @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath4 for a case of the kink wave . </S>",
    "<S> seismology of the magnetic flux tubes is possible to obtain various physical parameters from the observed period and amplitude of the oscillations . </S>"
