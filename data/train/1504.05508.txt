    "the first generation stars formed in galaxies are composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium .",
    "when these stars evolve and return their nuclear - processed interiors to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the enriched gas then present will be incorporated into future generation of stars .",
    "the amount of the chemical elements observed today and the timescales over which the ism is being enriched with heavy metals are then , a function of many processes : the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) , the rate of element production and eventual return to the ism via mass - loss and thresholds on the gas density for the star formation to proceed .",
    "the synthesis of the chemical elements and their return to the ism are functions of lifetime and mass of stars .",
    "as the physical conditions such as the surface density of gas in the galactic disk and the sfr vary throughout many galaxies , the observed / derived abundances are a function of position as well .",
    "therefore , the precise measurement of the variation of chemical elements as a function of radius in the galactic disk ( i.e. the radial abundance gradient ) and the gradient s temporal variation over the disk s lifetime are essential to develop a complete picture of galactic evolution",
    ".    stars numbering hundreds to thousands are born in rich open clusters ( ocs ) ( see for example , de silva et al .",
    "many high - dispersion spectroscopic abundance analyses support the presence of chemical homogeneity among cluster members with a typical star - to - star abundance scatter of about 0.01 to 0.05 over many elements ( carretta et al .",

    "2010 , reddy et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter paper i and reddy et al .",
    "2013 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "this implies that the ocs harbor coeval group of stars all formed in a single burst of star formation from a well mixed proto - cloud .",
    "an oc facilitates the measurement of basic parameters like age , distance , kinematics and metallicity more accurately than for field stars .",
    "the broad coverage of ages and galactocentric distances of these ocs make them powerful tracers to map the structure , kinematics , and chemistry of the galactic disk with respect to galactic coordinates and its evolution with time ."
