    "the weak lensing by large scale structures ( hereafter cosmic shear ) probes the projected mass density along the line - of - sight , regardless of the distribution of light .",
    "this could yield powerful constraints on the evolution of the dark matter power spectrum , the cosmological parameters and the mass / light bias as a function of the angular scale and the redshift ( see reviews from @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "four teams announced recently the first measurements of a significant variance of the shear @xmath4 on scales below 30 arc - minutes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all the measurements are in remarkable agreement , and it is worth to mention that these analyses were done from independent data sets obtained on various telescopes and by measuring galaxy shapes with different tools .",
    "moreover the signal is consistent with the theoretical expectations of current cosmological models , and does not show strong contamination by residual systematics . though it is not yet possible to break the degeneracy between the normalization of the power spectrum , @xmath1 , and the density parameter @xmath0 from a measure of @xmath5 alone ( @xcite,@xcite ) , some cosmological models can already be rejected ( like the cobe - normalized scdm which predicts too much power at small scale , at the 5-@xmath6 level ) .",
    "these encouraging results show that cosmic shear is close to be a mature tool and offers a neat complementary approach in cosmology compared to cmb anisotropies , snia , or galaxy catalogue statistics",
    ".    however , more quantitative and reliable constraints on cosmological models are still under way . the need for a high confidence level on the cosmic shear signal demands an excellent control of the systematics and a significant reduction of the cosmic variance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the former issue is discussed at length by @xcite and @xcite on real data , and it is also addressed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite using simulated data .",
    "they have carried out convincing tests and simulations in order to demonstrate that gravitational weak distortion is measurable down to slightly below the percent level , without critical issues regarding residuals from the psf corrections .    in order to convince that the signal is not contaminated by some unexpected systematics ,",
    "it is still important to diversify the observing conditions , and produce more independent data sets with different systematics . of equal importance",
    ", the field - to - field variations , caused by source and lens clusterings and by cosmic variance , are an additional source of noise .",
    "the four studies mentionned above cover a total area of about 5 deg@xmath7 but only totalize 28 _ uncorrelated _ fields .",
    "clearly , one needs to increase first the number of uncorrelated fields , rather than the total solid angle of the survey , to explore the field - to - field variation of the cosmic shear amplitude and to minimize the cosmic variance .",
    "this work explores a new data set obtained with the faint object spectrograph fors1 ( @xcite ) mounted on the first vlt ( ut1/antu ) at paranal ( program 63.o-0039a ; pi : mellier ) .",
    "these data provide independent measurements of the cosmic shear signal , in addition to the four previous studies , but with a totally new technology telescope and a new observing mode .",
    "in contrast to previous telescopes the vlt is continuously operated in an active optics mode and offers the possibility to observe in service mode .",
    "thanks to its large collecting power , the vlt can observe many single fields very quickly which permits to do deep pointings on many different lines - of - sights .",
    "this new strategy , complementary to the one we adopted on the cfht data ( @xcite ) , gave us an interesting large complementary sample of 50 vlt / fors1 uncorrelated fields for cosmic shear .",
    "the analysis of these fields is discussed below .",
    "they are then combined with other existing results to give the first constraints on ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) derived from cosmic shear .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 is a description of the data and the observations .",
    "details on data reduction are given in section 3 .",
    "the analysis of the fields and the measurements of the shapes of galaxies are developed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the systematics .",
    "discussion and combination with other results in a cosmological context is given in section 6 .",
    "the targets were selected from three very large sky areas close to the north and south galactic poles with the following criteria :    1 .",
    "no stars brighter than 8th magnitude inside a circle of 1 degree around the fors field ( to avoid light scattering ) ; 2 .   no stars",
    "brighter than 14th magnitude inside the fors field ; 3 .   no extended bright galaxies in the field .",
    "their luminous halo could contaminate the shape of galaxy located around them ; 4 .",
    "no rejection of over - dense regions , where clusters or groups of galaxies could be present from visual inspection of the digital sky survey , and no preferences towards empty fields .",
    "this criterion avoids biases toward under - dense regions with systematically low value of the convergence ; 5 .",
    "minimum separation between each pointing of at least 5 degrees in order to minimize the correlation between fields ; 6 .",
    "galactic latitudes lower than @xmath8 in order to get enough stars per field for the psf correction .",
    "we selected 50 fors1 fields , each covering 6.8@xmath96.8. the total field of view is 0.64 deg@xmath7 and the pointings are randomly distributed over more than 1000 deg@xmath7 . among those 50 fields ,",
    "two have been selected from the stis parallel data sample , for cosmic shear analysis on very small scale , and two are in common with the wht sample observed by @xcite .",
    "the observations are in i - band data only and were obtained with fors1 on the vlt / ut1 ( antu ) at the paranal observatory .",
    "they were carried out in service mode by the eso staff during period 63 ( march 1999 to september 1999 ) with the standard imaging mode of the spectrograph .",
    "it turns out that our program is perfectly suited for service mode , both from a practical point of view , since they are easily set up during service mode periods on ut1 , and from a scientific point of view , since we have a guarantee to get a complete set of data within our specifications .",
    "+ fors1 is equipped with a 2048@xmath92048 thinned ccd , backside illuminated .",
    "the pixel size is 24 @xmath10 m , providing a scale of 0.2 arc - second in standard mode of the instrument .",
    "remarkably , no fringe pattern has been detected on fors1 with this filter , so i - band observations enable one to get optimal image quality on each field . since we only requested non - photometric nights , with seeing lower than 0.8 arc - seconds , the schedule of our 50 fields over the semester was indeed quite easy . the total exposure time ( 36 minutes )",
    "was computed in order to reach @xmath11 , which corresponds to a galaxy number density per fields of about 30 gal @xmath12 .",
    "the expected average redshift of the lensed sources is @xmath13 .",
    "each pointing was split into at least @xmath14 minutes exposures with a random offset of 10 arc - seconds in between .",
    "some details about the 50 fields are given in table [ sumtab ] .",
    "the data were received by the end of november 1999 at iap .",
    "the processing of the 50 fields was done using the terapix data center facilities .",
    "the fors1 images are much smaller than the big ccd mosaics usually processed by terapix , so we used a specific pipeline which includes some iraf scripts .",
    "since the fors1 detector has four outputs , we simply consider each quadrant as an individual device during all the preprocessing stage .",
    "the master bias was built using a standard median filter .",
    "for the superflat , since the ccd images do not show fringe patterns , the processing can be done in one step with a simple un - smoothed master - flat to correct for the relative pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "however , the multiplicity of observations done in service mode provides images taken during different moon periods and with different weather conditions which can not be assembled to build up a single superflat . in our case ,",
    "when all the images are used , the global master - flat shows a strong and persistent gradient along the ccd ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is therefore preferable to use daily master flats by averaging only the images taken during the same night .",
    "the drawback is the small number of images which can be combined together .",
    "if it is too small , each individual frame has a strong relative weight which may results in correlated noise between individual images and the master - flat .",
    "therefore we decided to produce a special daily master - flat for each ) .",
    "in fact , 90% of them are within our seeing specifications , with an average value of 0.63  .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the photometric calibrations of the fors1 fields",
    "were done using the photometric standard star images provided by the eso staff at paranal .",
    "the fields were chosen in a fairly broad sample of the landolt s catalog ( @xcite ) : sa92 , sa95 , sa101 , sa109 , sa110 , mark - a , pg0131 - 051 , pg1313 - 086 , pg1633 + 099 , pg2213 - 006 , pg2331 + 055 .",
    "the photometric zero - points were calculated using magnitudes computed by sextractor and by rescaling the gains of each quadrant accordingly .",
    "we noticed a fluctuation of the zero - point of about @xmath16 magnitude along the observing period , probably produced by the important variation of the atmospheric conditions during the whole semester .",
    "the final photometric catalogs look sufficiently homogeneous from field to field for our purpose .",
    "the magnitude histograms for each field have the same shapes and show a cutoff at @xmath17 .",
    "this cut - off defines our limiting magnitude .",
    "five fields have a brighter magnitude cut - off at @xmath18 .",
    "these fields have the worse observational condition : seeing higher than 0.8 \" and high sky background due to the moonlight .",
    "some fields have a higher number of co - added frames but it does not change significantly the final magnitude limit of the 50 fields .",
    "the galaxies have been processed using our modified version of imcat softwarekaiser/ ] . the modifications and the general analysis method",
    "have already been described in section 3 of @xcite . here",
    "we remind shortly the selection procedure , paying attention only to the differences with the previous cfht data analysis .",
    "the principal steps are the followings :    * _ masking the boundaries : _ the splitting procedure of exposures generates noisy thick strips surrounding the ccd , with lower signal - to - noise ratio than the rest of the image , and a grid - like pattern produced by the stacking procedure .",
    "we therefore mask automatically the boundaries of each image . *",
    "_ masking the central cross - shape area : _ the four readout ports of the ccd delineate four well - defined quadrants with different readout noise , charge transfer efficiency and gain . at the junction of the quadrants , the sharp changes of ccd properties appear as a cross - shape area located in the middle of the ccd . in principle",
    ", this area is very small , but , like at the boundaries , the small shifts between each exposure enlarge its size which thus appears as a broad region with smaller signal - to - noise ratio than the rest of the image . on the fields affected by this effect",
    ", the central cross - area is masked . * _ masking objects : _ large areas around bright stars , saturated columns and diffraction patterns are masked on all images",
    ". they can produce spurious elongated structures which can be misinterpreted as shear signal .",
    "likewise , we also mask areas around bright and/or extended galaxies , elongated stripes produced by residuals from asteroids , satellites or aircrafts .",
    "the fraction of objects removed by this masking procedure ( boundaries , cross - shape area and objects ) varies from 10% to 20% .",
    "* _ stars selection : _ we use a radius ( @xmath19 ) vs magnitude ( @xmath20 ) plot to select unsaturated stars ( we do not include stars closer than one magnitude from the saturation level ) .",
    "the vertical box which encompasses the stars is carefully sized to avoid saturated stars and the crowed faint - magnitude areas of the @xmath21 diagram where galaxies and stars mix together .",
    "this domain contains very low signal - to - noise objects and is most of the time useless for the calibration . *",
    "_ fit of the stellar polarizability tensors : _ using these stars , we can map the psf by fitting their raw shape to a third order polynomial .",
    "we then compute the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; * _ source selection : _ the starting sample of galaxies is extracted from the 50 vlt fields using sextractor ( @xcite ) and produces a raw catalogue of 72500 galaxies .",
    "objects at the edge of the fields and deblended objects are immediately removed .",
    "galaxies with a half light radius smaller than the largest size of the star box are also removed .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , close pairs of galaxies may produce spurious elongated galaxies , consequently pairs with separation @xmath24 pixels are also removed .",
    "we do not perform any magnitude selection , therefore the redshift distribution is broad and can be described by : + @xmath25 } , \\label{z_source}\\ ] ] + with @xmath26 , which is consistent with a limiting magnitude @xmath27 as given by @xcite . * _ estimate of the shear : _ using the stellar fits , we compute the pre - seeing shear polarizability for all the selected sources as described in @xcite .",
    "+ figure [ refseeing ] shows the star ellipticities for all vlt fields before and after the psf correction .",
    "one of the fields shows a seeing significantly alterated by strong wind and its image quality is too far from our specifications , this field ( stis7new in table [ sumtab ] ) was removed .",
    "we ended up with 49 fields with in average 30 stars / field corresponding to a total number of 46941 galaxies , that is @xmath28 .",
    "note that this is less than the number given in table [ sumtab ] which was the number density _ before _ objects selection through our shape measurement process .      at this stage ,",
    "the variance of the shear can be computed exactly as described in @xcite .",
    "however here we have measured the signal in a slightly different manner . instead of computing the variance of the shear by simply squaring the averaged shear per cell , we directly removed the diagonal terms from the squared quantity , such that the computed variance is by definition an unbiased estimate of the true shear variance ( see @xcite )",
    ". therefore we do not need to subtract the shot noise contribution as in previous works , which was done using time - consuming monte - carlo randomizations .",
    "let us call @xmath29 the ellipticity of a galaxy at a position @xmath30 , and @xmath31 its weight , calculated according to @xcite ( see section 3.2 of that paper ) .",
    "an unbiased estimate of the variance of the shear @xmath32 at location @xmath33 can be directly obtained by measuring :    @xmath34={\\displaystyle \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^2 \\sum_{k\\ne l}^n w_k w_l e_\\alpha(\\vec\\theta_k ) e_\\alpha(\\vec\\theta_l ) \\over \\displaystyle \\sum_{k\\ne l}^n w_k w_l } \\label{estimator}\\ ] ]    the final product , the variance of the corrected ellipticity of galaxies as function of angular smoothing scales , is summarized on figure [ shearfigmodel ] . on this figure we also plot the results of the previous detections .",
    "the angular scale corresponds to the diameter of a circular top - hat filter ( we rescaled accordingly the angular scales of the previous studies which were published for a squared top - hat ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath6 error bars have been calculated from 100 realizations of noisy catalogues by randomizing the position angle of each galaxy .",
    "the amplitude and the shape of the signal are in good agreement with former results .",
    "they are within the 1-@xmath6 error at all scales ( note that the points are not independent ) .",
    "the agreement of these new measurements with previous ones provides a new independent indication that the signal is not produced by uncontrolled systematics .",
    "however , as for the cfht analysis ( see @xcite ) , we must analyze carefully the systematics in the vlt data .",
    "we checked the stability of this result with respect to the selection criteria by changing the star selection or the galaxy selection criteria . for the stars , we changed the box - size which encompasses the objects inside the vertical @xmath35 branch by increasing the magnitude range by 0.5 magnitude .",
    "for galaxies , we changed a few parameters , like the object definition ( 9 contiguous pixels having 0.5 @xmath6 above the background or 6 contiguous pixels having 1.5 @xmath6 above the background ) .",
    "we found that the amplitude of the variance fluctuates by @xmath36 on all scales but 2.5 arc - minute for which the fluctuation is larger ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "these fluctuations are within the 1-@xmath6 error bars , therefore selection criteria do not have a significant influence .",
    "+ figure [ shearfigmodel ] shows an unusual behavior at @xmath38 2.5 arc - minutes .",
    "the slope changes and the amplitude of the shear seems to increase and then to drop again on larger scales .",
    "this is a marginal perturbation within the error bars , but it turns out that it appears at the angular scale corresponding to one half the ccd size , so it could results from the masking procedure of the cross - shape area .",
    "we looked at this more carefully by computing the shear signal inside vertical and horizontal strips of similar width to the mask .",
    "the results shown on figure [ crosseffect ] ( which is discussed in the next section ) do not reveal any difference between the central regions ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) , where the two segments of the cross are located , and the rest of the image .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for systematics generated by the 4-port readout configuration and that the increase of the signal is likely random error due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio on that scale .",
    "a critical issue regarding the measurement of cosmic shear signal is the understanding and handling of the various systematics . as in previous studies",
    ", we have taken special care of this point with this new vlt data set .",
    "+ @xcite discussed various types of systematics , attempted to provide some technical solutions to avoid part of them prior to use the ksb correction and provided _ a posteriori _ quality check on the shear signal ( see sect .",
    "5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we used similar controls for the vlt data :    * _ ccd effects : _ the spurious signal produced by bad charge transfer efficiency , very bright stars , big galaxies or asteroids are considerably reduced by the masking procedure described in section 4 .",
    "possible residuals from charge transfer efficiency can be estimated by looking at the variation of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 components as function of the distance of objects with respect to the readout port , for each quadrant of the ccd . as shown in figure [ crosseffect ] , the corrected components @xmath43 and @xmath44 do not show variations along the @xmath45 or @xmath46 strips , except a small negative @xmath41 component versus the @xmath46 strip for @xmath47 .",
    "we shall see in the following that it has a completely negligible contribution to the variance of the shear .",
    "in fact , these plots do not show the significant systematic residual of the @xmath43 component which was observed on cfht data ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is likely that the residual observed on cfht data is intrinsic to the cfh12k camera .",
    "this also explains why it was not observed also by @xcite who only used uh8k data . *",
    "_ residuals from the correction of the psf anisotropy : _",
    "fors1 has a remarkable image quality over the field . because of the high quality of the optical design and of the small field of view of fors1 as compared to the uh8k and the cfh12k cameras , optical distortions are much smaller than in @xcite .",
    "however , active optics on the vlt could eventually produce a new and/or unexpected systematic effect not fully corrected with ksb .",
    "+ we tested the systematic residuals in exactly the same way as in @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in figures [ correlstargal ] and [ summarysystematics ] . the former shows that before the psf anisotropy correction , the ellipticities of stars and galaxies are correlated .",
    "in contrast , after the correction the average galaxy ellipticity is zero , whatever the psf anisotropy is .",
    "it shows that the correction of the psf anisotropy works very well even in the case of active optics and does not bias the corrected ellipticities of the galaxies .    as pointed out in @xcite , the averaged ellipticity of galaxies binned , either with respect to the star ellipticity or to the ccd lines / columns as described above ,",
    "is not a strong enough test of systematics because it is still possible that the galaxy ellipiticities strongly fluctuate inside very small bins .",
    "it is therefore better to measure the variance @xmath48 instead of a simple average in bins .",
    "moreover , the result found can be compared directly to the signal provided that , for each scale , the bin size is adapted to encompass a similar number of galaxies as in the top - hat filter used to measure the signal .",
    "if our corrections are not contaminated by strong systematics , at all scales this variance must be much smaller than the signal .",
    "+ figure [ summarysystematics ] shows the results . for each of the three panels ,",
    "the filled circles with error bars show the vlt results as shown in figure [ shearfigmodel ] , and the dashed lines show the 1-@xmath6 error bars obtained from 100 randomizations of the position angle of galaxies . the open circles in the top panel show @xmath48 measured in bins of galaxies sorted according to the strength of the anisotropy of stars ( either @xmath49 or @xmath50 corresponding to the two sets of open circles ) .",
    "the open circles in the middle panel show @xmath48 with the galaxies sorted according to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 positions on the ccds .",
    "( again , each set of open circles correspond to galaxies sorted either according @xmath45 or to @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the slight negative component @xmath51 observed for @xmath47 in figure [ crosseffect ] is not strong enough to produce a significant systematic compared to the signal .",
    "these two panels demonstrate that the residuals are always within the 1-@xmath6 error and fluctuate around zero .",
    "we conclude that these residuals are not responsible for the signal we detect . + it is interesting to estimate how strong the systematic effects could be if we neglected to correct the shape of the galaxies for the psf anisotropies .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ summarysystematics ] where @xmath48 is computed in the same way as for the top panel , but with galaxies uncorrected for the psf anisotropy .",
    "the uncorrected signal shows a significant offset which is almost insensitive to the angular scale ( because the psf is roughly constant over each ccd ) .",
    "therefore , the shape and the amplitude of the signal are unlikely to be produced by residuals from the psf anisotropy .",
    "moreover , we see that a complete lack of anisotropy correction produces a systematic of similar amplitude as the real signal ( and not much higher )",
    ". therefore , even a partial anisotropy correction already permits the detection of the cosmic signal .",
    "the vlt data confirms the detection of a significant weak distortion signal on angular scales between 0.5 to 5 arcminutes .",
    "its amplitude and its shape are similar to those announced previously on these angular scales by four independent teams .",
    "the study of systematics does not reveal any bias and reproduces similar trends as for the cfht data but on a much larger sample of uncorrelated fields and on a more homogeneous sample ( only i band , narrow seeing distribution and depth ) .",
    "it is interesting to investigate what constraints on cosmological models we could provide from the cosmic shear surveys completed so far by @xcite ( cfht ) , @xcite ( wht ) , @xcite ( ctio ) , @xcite ( cfht ) and by adding the vlt data ( this work ) .",
    "the five data set have been observed either in @xmath52 or in i - bands , at roughly the same depth ( @xmath53 ) , so we can assume that the average redshifts of the sources are almost the same and should be close to the value inferred from the deep redshift survey carried by @xcite : @xmath54 with the broad distribution given by eq.([z_source ] ) .",
    "figure [ shearfigmodel ] shows some current cosmological models with the present - day data .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum of density fluctuations has been taken into account following the prescription given by @xcite .",
    "one can see that the cluster normalised models fit very well the observations , at least on scales ranging from 0.5 to 10 arc - minutes .",
    "however , this plot does not really illustrate the constraints on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 we can expect from measurements of the variance of the shear .",
    "a more reliable study consists in exploring a very large set of models in a ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) space . as we can see from figure [ shearfigmodel ] , and as noted before ( @xcite ) , the dependence on the cosmological constant of the variance of the shear is rather weak , and it is not worth to include @xmath55 as a free parameter in this analysis .",
    "let us consider all the five cosmic shear results simultaneously .",
    "since they provide independent samples , we can use one single measurement point for each of them and perform a simple @xmath56 minimization in the ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) plane . from each cosmic shear measurements we choose the point which has the best signal - to - noise , and we avoid the large scale measures in @xcite and @xcite , as they are likely affected by finite size effects which tend to increase the error bars ( see @xcite for a general discussion , or @xcite for a specific application to cosmic shear surveys ) .",
    "we extracted five triplets containing the scale , the variance and the 1-@xmath6 error , ( @xmath57 , @xmath58,@xmath59 ) , out of the literature ( the results reported on figure [ shearfigmodel ] ) and computed :    @xmath60 ^ 2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the predicted variance for a given cosmological model .",
    "we computed it for 150 models inside the box @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with @xmath3 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . with @xmath66 data points and two free parameters",
    ", the @xmath56 has 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "the result is given in figure [ chi2model ] .",
    "the grey scales indicates the 1 , 2 and 3-@xmath6 confidence level contours .",
    "the best fitted models can be described by the empirical law : @xmath67 in the range @xmath68 arc - minutes .",
    "this is in remarkable agreement with @xcite who predicted @xmath69 at non - linear scales , and this is very close to the cluster normalization constraints given in @xcite ( for closed models and @xmath70 ) : @xmath71 this law overplotted on figure [ chi2model ] shows a remarkable agreement between these two approaches .",
    "our analysis is still preliminary .",
    "we have only five independent data points spread over a rather small angular scale .",
    "we also assumed the peak in the redshift distribution of the sources to be @xmath65 with the broad distribution given in eq.([z_source ] ) .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption on the basis of the spectroscopic survey carried out by @xcite , but it is still uncertain and needs further confirmations .",
    "we also neglected the cosmic variance in the error budget of the cosmic shear sample .",
    "although it does not affect seriously the vlt data which contain 50 uncorrelated fields and the @xcite data point ( because they estimated the cosmic variance using a gaussian field hypothesis ) , the three other measures are probably affected .",
    "however , numerical simulations already indicate that cosmic variance should only increase our error bars by less than a factor of two , according to the survey size ( see @xcite ) . we expect to have much better constraints on the redshift and the clustering of sources once the virmos redshift survey will be completed ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", a measurement of the skewness of the convergence will break the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we have confirmed the cosmic shear signal detected on scales ranging from 0.5 to 5 arc - minutes using for the first time a large sample ( 50 ) of uncorrelated fields obtained with the vlt ut1/antu . the service mode available on this telescope gave an unprecedented high quality and homogeneous data set .",
    "the fields are spread over more than 1000 square - degrees , which minimizes the noise produced by cosmic variance .",
    "the amplitude and the shape of the shear are similar to those measured from other telescopes which permits to make a strong statement about the robustness of the signal with respect to various sources of systematics .    assuming the signal is purely cosmic shear ( that is we neglect the possible intrinsic shape correlation )",
    ", we used the four other studies published so far to infer first constraints on cosmological models .",
    "the cosmic shear surveys provide constraints which are in remarkable agreement with those from cluster abundance analysis . as compare to it ,",
    "the variance of the shear is a direct measure of the combined parameters @xmath72 .",
    "as soon as the residual biases are well controlled , and the redsfhit of the sources known , the measurement of @xmath73 will naturally converge to the exact @xmath72 value with an accuracy that will only depends on the accumulation of measurements on uncorrelated fields of view .",
    "this study shows the great potential of cosmic shear for cosmology and what we can expect from future wide fields surveys .",
    "in particular , the skewness of the convergence , which is insensitive to @xmath1 , will appear as a vertical constraint on figure [ chi2model ] therefore breaking the @xmath0-@xmath1 degeneracy .",

    "<S> we observed with the camera fors1 on the vlt ( ut1 , antu ) 50 randomly selected fields and analyzed the cosmic shear inside circular apertures with diameter ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 arc - minutes . </S>",
    "<S> the images were obtained in optimal conditions by using the service observing proposed by eso on the vlt , which enabled us to get a well - defined and homogeneous set of data . </S>",
    "<S> the 50 fields cover a 0.65 square - degrees area spread over more than 1000 square - degrees which provides a sample ideal for minimizing the cosmic variance . using the same techniques as in @xcite , we measured the cosmic shear signal and investigated the systematics of the vlt sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find a significant excess of correlations between galaxy ellipticities on those angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude and the shape of the correlation as function of angular scale are remarkably similar to those reported so far . </S>",
    "<S> + using our combined vlt and cfht data and adding the results published by other teams we put the first joint constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 using cosmic shear surveys . from a deduced average of the redshift of the sources the combined data are consistent with @xmath2 ( for a cdm power spectrum and @xmath3 ) , in excellent agreement with the cosmological constraints obtained from the local cluster abundance .    </S>",
