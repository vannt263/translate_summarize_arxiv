    "the theory of cosmological inflation has been very successful in proving potential answers to several deep questions in early universe cosmology , as well as testable ( and tested ) cosmological predictions . however , a crucial  side effect \" of many versions of inflation is that the exponential expansion tends to continue on eternally into the future , with only pockets of the universe ceasing to inflate locally .",
    "this scenario is known as eternal inflation ( see e.g. refs  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "eternal inflation can be driven by several mechanisms . in the present study ,",
    "we concern ourselves with the  false vacuum \" variety , in which inflation occurs as a result of an inflaton ( usually taken to be an effective scalar field , @xmath1 ) being trapped in a metastable false vacuum .",
    "inflation ends locally when the field transitions to a nearby  truer \" vacuum on the potential .",
    "if the probability per unit four - volume of such a transition , @xmath2 , is small compared to the hubble scale of the inflating false vacuum @xmath3 ( as typically assumed ) , then false vacuum inflation is eternal . for many potentials ,",
    "the dominant transition mechanism is bubble nucleation @xcite , which can quite naturally produce open frw universes much like our own . in this study",
    ", we will work under the assumption that we live in one such universe , dubbed  the observation bubble \" .",
    "a fascinating consequence of false vacuum eternal inflation is that other bubbles inevitably form in the four - volume to the past of the observation bubble wall .",
    "these bubbles collide with the observation bubble wall , potentially leading to detectable signatures of  cosmic bubbles \" outside of our own , provided that an observer can exist to the future of the collision .",
    "much recent work has been dedicated to the study of such relics  @xcite ( for a general review , see e.g. ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that if a collision is  mild \" enough , it can potentially be compatible with the formation and survival of observers in the post - collision region @xcite while producing testable predictions for observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite , bulk galactic flow @xcite , and possibly other cosmological observables ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .    while the observation bubble wall undergoes a divergent number of collisions , whether or not these collisions lie within the observer s past lightcone at decoupling depends on several factors , such as the position of the observer and the cosmology inside the observation bubble , which we review in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : distributions ] .",
    "previous studies have focused on the outcome of a single observable collision , or a few collisions whose affected post - collision regions do not intersect . in these cases , the azimuthal symmetry of the collisions perturbations to the observation bubble spacetime is maintained and one expects to see an azimuthally symmetric disk on the cmb sky corresponding to each collision @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite have searched for these disk - like patterns in the wmap7 cmb temperature data and have found a few candidates for collision events .    as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : distributions ] , however , for arbitrary choices of the various parameters , the number of observable bubbles @xmath4 can potentially range from zero to very large numbers , and there is no particular reason to expect @xmath5 one observable collision rather than none or many . when @xmath6 , the picture differs from that of previous studies in several respects :    1 .",
    "the future light cones of the different collisions will tend to intersect one another .",
    "thus , the effects arising from various collisions can potentially interact .",
    "2 .   one must address the possibility that some bubbles may in fact collide with each other before impacting the observation bubble wall , leading to a qualitatively different collision scenario than before .",
    "3 .   since any given part of an observer s lss will have been affected by several different collisions , the azimuthal symmetry of an isolated collision is no longer evident .",
    "4 .   with a large number of bubble collisions , one may be able to make meaningful statistical predictions about what a given observer can expect to see .",
    "the purpose of this study is to explore these issues and take the first step towards assessing how many - bubble scenarios can be constrained by current and future observations . as a first look , we will focus primarily on the effect of the collisions on the cmb temperature , deferring an analysis of the other relevant observables to future study .",
    "clearly if we are to be living in such a large-@xmath4 scenario , the effect of each collision must in some sense be  small \" so as not to disrupt the subsequent cosmological evolution in the observation bubble . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : mult_prof ] , the strength of a collision is determined by the position of the nucleation center of the colliding bubble in the exterior de sitter ( ds ) space , as well as the details of the underlying potential , which are unknown . thus , in analyzing scenarios with @xmath7 , we will simply start with the assumption that an observer exists with a large number of collisions intersecting the visible portion of the last scattering surface and study what might be observed .",
    "this is in keeping with previous work on the cmb temperature profile for single collisions .",
    "we do not consider scenarios in which some collisions might prevent inflation to the future of the collision , such as those in small - field type potentials ( see the discussion in ref .",

    "observations of e.g. large scale structure , as well as cmb polarization and non - gaussianity , will also be affected by the collisions and should be investigated .",
    "these signatures are left for future extensions of this work . *",
    "our results are useful primarily for large @xmath85 ; for a small number of bubbles , searching for disk templates on the sky should provide much stronger constraints .",
    "in this study , we have begun to address the possibility of having many cosmic bubble collisions influencing the visible portion of our last scattering surface .",
    "this can occur despite vanishingly small nucleation rates as long as it is compensated for by a large ratio of hubble constants between the false vacuum and the presumed inflationary phase in the observation bubble .",
    "for such a scenario to be compatible with the existence of observers ( and to not produce effects clearly inconsistent with observation ) , the effects of the collisions must be mild , suggesting that one should be able to treat the effects of collisions perturbatively for models of interest .",
    "we were thus led to consider a scenario where many bubbles collide with the observation bubble while leaving the interior frw foliation intact , supporting inflation and a standard background cosmology to the future of the collisions and allowing us to study the effects of the collisions on the last scattering surface and cmb temperature spectrum .    given a number of reasonable simplifying assumptions , we are led to a model for these perturbations with the following characteristics .",
    "* the overall effect on the last - scattering surface and on the cmb temperature is necessarily small ( assumed for compatibility with observations . ) * the total perturbation on the last - scattering surface is a superposition of individual bubble perturbations ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : intervening ] ) resulting from collisions with bubbles decaying to the same vacuum ( which may or may not match that of the observation bubble . ) * each bubble appears to cover less than half of the sky ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : frame ] ) , with a size distribution that is flat in @xmath290 , where @xmath57 is the angular size of the perturbed disk ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : prob ] ) . *",
    "each bubble s profile is a ` truncated dipole ' , with central amplitude dependent on @xmath57 and @xmath43 , a ` kinematic ' parameter describing the ( ds - invariant ) distance between the bubbles nucleation points ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : single ] ) . *",
    "the details of the kinematics and the inflaton potential that determine the perturbation strength can be folded into two parameters @xmath235 .",
    "the other relevant quantity is the total number @xmath85 of ( less than full - sky ) bubbles on the last - scattering surface .",
    "these three parameters are sufficient to describe the effects of many collisions on the cmb temperature .",
    "we put this picture forward as a scenario that is both sufficiently simple that predictions can be computed in detail from it , and including enough aspects of a realistic scenario so that it should give an accurate overall picture of the expected effect of a many - bubble scenario .",
    "the above picture , to a good approximation , yields a contribution to the @xmath291 power spectrum of @xmath292 where @xmath293 , @xmath238 encodes features of the inflaton potential that determine the amplitude of a given collision perturbation , and @xmath243 is a fixed function given by eq .",

    "this equation holds with increasing accuracy as @xmath85 becomes large .",
    "the resulting power spectrum contribution is very red - tilted ( see fig .  [",

    "a multiple collision scenario with @xmath85 visible bubbles and average brightness described by @xmath238 consistent with observations of the cmb power spectrum would require roughly @xmath294 .",
    "this bound can in turn be used to constrain a given well - specified scenario by developing in detail the link between the inflaton potential and the parameters @xmath295 @xmath90 , and @xmath85 .",
    "we emphasize that this is a first study aimed at laying the groundwork for such scenarios and computing constraints using the power spectrum .",
    "it is quite possible , and even likely , that other observables like polarization or non - gaussianity could give significantly stronger constraints , or provide a cleaner method for the actual detection of bubble effects .",
    "this set of methods comprises a complement for those already developed to investigate scenarios with a few bubble impacts . in either case , refinement of these tests",
