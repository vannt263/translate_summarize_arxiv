    "as semiconductor technology continues scaling , metal interconnects must scale with minimum feature size ( 25 nm in the generation currently in development ) to connect to nanometer scale devices .",
    "however , in nanoscale metal wires , conductivity can degrade by more than 50% compared to the bulk metal @xcite . as a result ,",
    "both circuit delay times and power consumption may soon be dominated by interconnect @xcite .",
    "the causes of this degradation are believed to be grain boundary , surface roughness , and interface scattering @xcite .",
    "as interconnect cross sections decrease , the interactions at the surface or interface with other materials become more important . also , grain size is observed to scale roughly with wire thickness @xcite . however , there is limited understanding of the relative importance of these scattering sources on the observed degradation @xcite , nor is it known to what degree defects and impurities modulate these effects .",
    "widely used semi - empirical models of surface @xcite and grain boundary scattering @xcite and quantum models of surface scattering @xcite have been developed , but there has not been sufficient understanding of grain boundary scattering at the atomic level .",
    "elsewhere , two of us have studied the effects of wire surface roughness @xcite and barrier / adhesion / seed layer scattering @xcite on conduction .    in this paper , we present atomic - scale modeling and analysis of grain boundary reflectivity in metals and compare these results with experimental data .",
    "we also analyze the structure of grain boundaries , investigating in detail the determining factors of scattering .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we present a summary of our method and our results for single - boundary reflectivity .",
    "next , we give comparisons to published reflectivity measurements , both for multiple- and single - boundary measurements .",
    "then we give detailed analyses of the causes of grain boundary reflectivity , breaking these into effects of a mismatch between bloch states in the two crystallites and the effects of disorder and defects .",
    "finally , we raise some concerns regarding the standard model in the literature for relating microscopically calculated reflectivities with macroscopic resistivity , and present our investigations into this model s validity , as well as proposing some suggestions on how the model could be improved .",
    "we use the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method and the landauer formalism in this work @xcite .",
    "we use the code atomistix@xcite to implement the calculations . in the landauer formulation@xcite ,",
    "the resistance in perfect metal crystals at absolute zero ( ballistic conductors ) is contact resistance ( the reciprocal of sharvin conductance ) .",
    "this is caused by the finite number of transverse modes per unit area with cutoff less than the fermi energy .",
    "the number of modes is equivalent to the cross sectional area of the fermi surface in a plane normal to the transmission direction : = = = [ eq : cond - ballist ] where @xmath0 is sharvin conductance , @xmath1 is ballistic transmission , @xmath2 is a unit vector normal to the fermi surface , @xmath3 is the transmission direction , @xmath4 is the number of forward - moving modes with @xmath5 , and the integration domain is the set of points on the fermi surface with @xmath6 . in this paper",

    "in this section , we detail the agreement of our calculated grain boundary reflectivity with experimental results . the difference in length scales ( along the transport direction ) between those systems that can currently be simulated and actual wires",
    "necessarily introduces some uncertainty into the comparison .",
    "here we compare results despite this theory / measurement gap , but we return to the issue in section [ sec : validity - ms ] .      in the literature ,",
    "the mayadas - shatzkes ( ms ) model @xcite is the most widely used analytical model to extract grain boundary reflectivity from experimental measurements of resistivity @xmath14 .",
    "the ms model describes metal conductivity as a function of boundary reflectivity @xmath7 and grain size @xmath15 .",
    "the model s basic assumptions are that grain boundaries are randomly distributed , that all reflections are specular and occur with probability @xmath7 independent of incoming momentum , and that transport is semiclassical between boundaries . as we will describe in section [ sec : validity - ms ] several considerations lead us to question the validity of these assumptions .",
    "still , we compare our results for @xmath7 to measurements of resistivity @xmath14 by using ms , as it is currently the standard model of @xmath14 as a function of microscopic properties .",
    "the ms model agrees with an even simpler model we constructed based only on the assumptions of the landauer formula @xcite and multiple scattering from grain boundaries with average reflection probability @xmath7 .",
    "this is important because it allows us to extend the model s predictions to more general cases . for resistivity of a conductor with both bulk scattering of mean free path @xmath16 and grain boundary scattering , both theories give the resistivity augmentation over bulk as : [ eq : ms ] 1 + over most of the range of @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 in our simplified model and @xmath19 in ms @xcite .",
    "thus , at room temperature and @xmath20 nm , a grain boundary reflectivity of 20% increases resistivity by @xmath2131% over the bulk value .",
    "we use the ms model to compare our results for @xmath7 at 0 k to experimental results at 5 k , in the regime where bulk scattering effects are minimal .",
    "although cu is more important for integrated circuits , more experimental data is available on ag .",
    "the low temperature experiments @xcite indicate @xmath22 for ag , in comparison to our values of @xmath23 for twin boundaries and @xmath7 from 16% to 46% for non - twin boundaries ( table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "a survey of experimental results @xcite indicates @xmath7 values for cu and ag ( computed with ms ) in the range of 24% to 46% , in good agreement with our predictions .",
    "a more direct comparison can be provided by a few experiments measuring grain boundary resistance directly in a metal .",
    "et al._@xcite measured potential difference across single grains in au ( an fcc noble metal like cu and ag ) , and found reflectivity in the range 70% to 90% , depending on orientation .",
    "nakamichi@xcite measured interface resistivity @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is interface resistance ) in al for various single grain boundaries . to compute reflectivity from nakamichi s results",
    ", we estimate the ballistic conductance per unit area @xmath26 for al by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond - ballist ] ) assuming a spherical fermi surface .",
    "we then compute reflectivity with r = 1 - .",
    "aggregating nakamichi s results and analyzing according to this expression , we find most of the measured twin boundary results in the range @xmath7 = 0% to 27% and non - twin results in the range @xmath7 = 36% to 51% .",
    "this range of reflectivity variations agrees well with our findings , particularly given the different materials used .",
    "although real grain boundaries in metals are not necessarily two - dimensional plane defects nor form orthogonal interfaces to the transmission direction , we have isolated the effects and simulated them individually .    since a grain boundary is the interface between two crystallites , there are two broad categories of scattering that could occur : 1 ) scattering caused by the misaligned crystal orientation of the two grains , a category we refer to as _ orientation effects _ ; and 2 ) the atomic structure in the interface itself , which we call _ atomic position effects_. we present simulations and analytical arguments to quantify these two effects .",
    "we wish to understand the contribution to scattering from the change in orientation across grains , @xmath27 .",
    "an ideal coincidence site lattice ( csl ) twin boundary has zero thickness , so the only possible cause of scattering is the abrupt change in orientation .",
    "we therefore consider our results for reflectivity of unrelaxed twin csls , @xmath28 , an estimate of the orientation effect .    in table",
    "[ tab : results ] , most of the non - twin reflectivities are higher than the twin ones .",
    "this is likely due partly to atomic position effects ( since the interface is less sharp ) .",
    "but it may also be due to the difference in bloch bases in the two grains , particularly if incident states are poorly approximated by states in the other grain .",
    "we therefore simulate transmission in several different grain orientations .",
    "we estimate the orientation effect , due to impedance mismatch between different sets of bloch states in the two crystallites , by the relative difference @xmath29 in transmission across the boundary .",
    "( this is by analogy to a simple 1d quantum potential step , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the momenta of the states on either side of the step . )",
    "we find that transmission in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 directions are similar , while transmission in the @xmath35 direction is significantly higher .",
    "we find transmission for two intermediate orientations @xmath36 and @xmath37 to be between that of @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "this shows a large dependence of @xmath9 on orientation for a perfect crystal , although in a realistic system , we expect that bulk scattering would diminish the orientation effect .    to confirm this large dependence of transmission @xmath9 on orientation we compare the simulation results with an analytical estimate of @xmath9 as a function of orientation in cu .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond - ballist ] ) may be evaluated numerically for different directions @xmath38 .",
    "the deviations from a spherical fermi surface then give the effect of grain orientation on ballistic transmission .",
    "in the fermi surfaces of cu and ag , the eight ( 111 ) directions each contain a `` neck '' that intersects the brillouin zone edge .",
    "these necks contribute to eq .",

    "this qualitatively agrees with our negf - based prediction that the transmission in @xmath34 is similar to @xmath33 and greater in @xmath35 relative to @xmath33 .",
    "we isolate the atomic position effect in the interface by simulating structures with specific structures and extracting the magnitude of the reflectivity , @xmath41 .",

    "results are @xmath7 = 8% and 16% ( table [ tab : results ] ) , scaling linearly with vacancy density consistent with additive reflectivities .",
    "the scattering cross section is on the order of magnitude of the area of the missing atoms , as one missing atom per 39 @xmath12 corresponds roughly to one vacancy in 12 atoms ( 3 unit cells ) of the interface giving an analytical expectation of @xmath43 , in agreement with the calculations .",

    "note that structures are periodic out of the page , but alternate atoms are inequivalent . ]      to further investigate the effect of atomic position on reflectivity , we simulate layers of disordered cu atoms as shown in figure [ fig : disorder ] to isolate the impact of crystalline order on conduction .",
    "the disordered atoms are displaced by normally distributed random vectors with root mean square ( rms ) magnitude 0.24   or 0.70  .",
    "we change the number @xmath44 of such layers and expect from theory that @xmath45 with a constant @xmath46 , since localization length is long compared to our system size@xcite .",

    "systems with smaller @xmath44 have a subset of the disordered region present in systems with larger @xmath44 .",

    "these structures are not the only possible departures from crystalline order , but provide an estimate of the magnitude of the atomic position effect : @xmath47 with @xmath48 the defect area density in the boundary , and @xmath49 , depending on the magnitude of disorder in the boundary .",
    "the objective of these estimates is to approximately predict @xmath41 , as function of structure .",
    "both estimates reflect a strong dependence of grain boundary reflectivity on atomic position ( e.g. gaps , relaxation ) .",
    "we also attempt to check the validity of the mayadas - shatzkes ( ms ) model assumptions using model systems with multiple grain boundaries .",
    "the aim of this investigation is to raise the question : are the assumptions in the ms model , such as the characterization of all grain boundary scattering in a metal by a single reflectivity parameter , tenable ?",
    "this undertaking is motivated partly by a lack of consistency in published reflectivities for the same metals .",
    "the mayadas - shatzkes model makes many assumptions , which we summarize here :    * transport is semiclassical between grain boundaries . *",
    "grain boundaries are perpendicular to transport .",
    "* grain boundaries are translation - invariant along the boundary . *",
    "transmission at grain boundaries can be characterized by a single parameter @xmath7 . *",
    "all boundaries in a sample are identical ( same @xmath7 ) .",
    "some of these assumptions are clearly objectionable , and it seems likely that some may affect the final result . for example , consider the assumption of translation - invariant boundaries . in the presence of bulk scattering , velocities are randomized within a few mean free paths of the boundary , so the assumption of specular reflection or undeflected transmission may not matter , as long as @xmath7 matches the average reflection probability .",
    "but if grain size is comparable to mean free path ( hard to avoid with wire thickness @xmath50 nm @xmath51 room temperature mean free path of 39 nm ) , or several boundaries are particularly close together , then the particular states transmitting through one boundary and incident on a second may affect overall transmission .",
    "we simulate just such a system here .",
    "we did simulations with two ( 210 ) / ( 120 ) twin boundaries separated by from 2.4 nm to 4.6 nm ( figure [ fig : multi - grain ] ) .",
    "although this differs markedly from an infinite system as considered in the ms model , the discussion surrounding eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms ] ) justifies comparing the results using our simplified landauer transport model for multiple reflection between just two identical boundaries .",
    "this model gives the total reflectivity as r_t = 2r / ( 1+r ) , [ eq : land-2 ] where @xmath7 is the reflectivity of a single boundary@xcite ( assuming averaging over angles of reflection destroys the coherence in the electron wavefunction between the boundaries ) . using our single - boundary results ( table [ tab : results ] ) , we anticipate @xmath52 = 29% for cu and @xmath52 = 21% for ag .",
    "we find our simulation results differ from the smallest to largest grain size as shown in table [ tab : doublegrain ] .",
    "we attribute this change in reflectivity to interactions between boundaries .",
    "we also find the simulated @xmath52 is somewhat lower than that predicted by ( [ eq : land-2 ] ) .",
    "this may be explained by the observation that transmission depends strongly on initial momentum in our single - boundary simulations .",
    "the first boundary may act as a filter , letting only those states with highest transmission through to the second boundary .",
    "if a real sample contained a pair of similar boundaries with spacing small compared to the bulk mean free path ( like our model systems ) , one might therefore expect the ms predictions to fail .",
    "the ms model also fails to consider nonspecular reflection and transmission of electrons .",
    "still , this explanation would be affected by bulk scattering or variety in boundary type , factors which render the semi - classical ms treatment more tenable .",
    "the failure of ms in the system here could be criticized on the grounds that the simulated system is unrealistic .",
    "our response is that small grain separation is becoming likelier as wire dimensions shrink , while our neglect of phonon scattering is rendered more realistic by small grain size and the inclusion of disorder in our simulated boundary .",
    "the ideal test of ms would be a first - principles simulation with multiple , different grain boundaries separated by a more realistic grain size , together with bulk scattering , but this unfortunately is not yet practical .",
    "the goal of our test has simply been to narrow the theory - measurement gap with the computing resources currently available . based on these analytical and computational considerations ,",
    "we propose that an ms - like model with 1 ) multiple reflectivity parameters for different incident momenta , 2 ) a treatment of the statistical likelihood of ballistic propagation between boundaries , and 3 ) allowance for deflected transport and grain boundary angles would capture more relevant physics and probably give more consistency across measurements .    ]    .",

    "grain boundary scattering is still probably more important than the relatively small contribution from surface roughness scattering @xcite , and even the moderate contribution from barrier layer interface scattering @xcite .",
