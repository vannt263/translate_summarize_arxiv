    "quantum hall ( qh ) states are incompressible quantum fluids where all bulk excitations are gapped , but gapless modes exist at the boundaries . in the integer effect , edge states can be understood in a simple way for non - interacting electrons  @xcite , with an edge channel matching each filled landau level in the bulk , as the landau bands bend at the edges of the system due to the confining potential and cross the fermi level . in the fractional effect",
    "the situation is richer , and there is a one - to - one relation due to gauge invariance that ties the bulk states , classified by 2 + 1d chern - simons theories , and the gapless edge modes  @xcite .",
    "depending on the bulk filling fraction or the details of edge confinement , the edge theory may contain , in addition to a charge mode that carries the quantized hall currents , neutral modes .",
    "for example , even for a @xmath2 qh state , neutral modes are present if the edge is smooth or reconstructed  @xcite . for fractional qh states , even for sharply defined edges",
    ", neutral modes may be present .",
    "such is the case for @xmath0 states  @xcite , as well as for the @xmath1 pfaffian and anti - pfaffian non - abelian states  @xcite , and  the  situation  becomes  even  richer if the edges of such states undergo reconstructions  @xcite .",
    "chiral charge modes , which can not be localized by disorder , are closely tied to the quantization of the hall conductance ; hence the existence of these modes is unavoidable .",
    "experiments have been designed to probe the propagation of these charge modes , in particular to measure their wave velocity  @xcite . on the other hand , to the best of our knowledge , there has not been any experimental result that confirms the existence of the neutral modes .",
    "there are a number of reasons as to why one should seriously look into ways of detecting neutral edge modes .",
    "for example , there are theoretically unresolved experimental findings on tunneling on the edges of qh liquids in cleaved - edge overgrown samples  @xcite which could be better understood if information on the neutral modes were available .",
    "more specifically , in these experiments one measures a non - linear @xmath3 characteristic of luttinger liquid behavior at the edges ; however , the power - law exponent is not in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite . instead",
    ", these exponents match those obtained if one had only the charge mode and no neutral ones",
    ". however , one can not construct an operator for creating an excitation with the charge of an electron and fermionic statistics using the charge mode alone .",
    "hence , the neutral modes are both the champions and the villains lingering over the resolution of this puzzle , and this has led to proposals that the neutral modes may be either extremely slow  @xcite or topological and non - propagating at all  @xcite .",
    "another reason to probe neutral modes is that , in the case of the interesting non - abelian states , these are the modes that carry the non - local information of the order and twinning of edge quasiparticles .    ,",
    "width=324 ]    the objective of this paper is to propose a way to probe neutral edge modes .",
    "the proposed set - up consists of a long contact region , or quantum long contact ( qlc ) , in which there are several interfering paths for tunneling charge from two opposite edges of a hall bar , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : longqpc ] , resembling an ac josephson junction .",
    "the idea of exploring interference between tunneling paths is reminiscent of a two - point contact interferometer  @xcite ( 2pc ) for probing quasiparticle statistics .",
    "both methods are sensitive to neutral edge modes , the main difference being the observation window : the long contact setup probes slower edge velocities than the two - point contact setup .",
    "we find that coherent tunneling inside a qlc gives rise to a resonance in the tunneling current at zero temperature for a bias voltage @xmath4 given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the width of the qlc , @xmath7 is the magnetic length , and @xmath8 is the slowest edge velocity associated with the tunneling quasiparticle .",
    "the origin for the resonance has a simple explanation .",
    "the interference of a tunneling quasiparticle between two paths , separated by a distance @xmath9 along the edge , is guided by two phases : on the one hand there is the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath10 that basically multiplies the quasiparticle charge @xmath11 with the flux enclosed in the area @xmath12 ; on the other hand there is the phase @xmath13 that is introduced by an applied bias voltage @xmath14 between the two edges , with josephson frequency @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the resonance occurs at the stated voltage @xmath4 when the two phases become equal and give rise to constructive interference .",
    "the resonance condition follows from the interference among multiple tunneling paths along the length @xmath17 of the qlc ; however , notice that the length of the channel drops out of the resonance condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) . the resonance becomes sharper for longer lengths @xmath17 of the qlc . at finite temperature @xmath18",
    "the resonance will be reduced and for temperature @xmath19 it will be washed out",
    ". a sharp resonance in the tunneling current will lead to a strong peak followed by a strong dip in the tunneling conductance at non - zero bias .",
    "now , if there are multiple edge velocities associated with propagation of the quasiparticle along the edge , there are in principle multiple phases @xmath20 , one for each velocity .",
    "we are especially interested in a situation where there are two velocities : one fast velocity associated with the charged mode , and one slow velocity associated with the neutral mode(s ) . for the charged mode",
    "the edge velocity is expected on general grounds to be determined by the scale set by electron - electron interactions , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the dielectric constant of the medium ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore , the charge mode velocity is of order @xmath24 . with a width @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "we would find @xmath27 ; the current that would have to be driven through the sample at such a voltage would surely destroy the quantum hall state .",
    "a resonance due to such a fast velocity is thus not likely experimentally accessible at a qlc . a neutral mode velocity is not bound to the scale set by coulomb interactions though , and can in principle be orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "we proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] with a detailed calculation of the tunneling current to determine the precise lineshape of the resonance ; fig .",
    "[ fig : gtunplots ] illustrates the main result of this paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we focus on the range of accessible slow edge velocities and compare the observation ranges of the qlc and the 2pc .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "in this section we calculate the tunneling current through a qlc to determine the lineshape of the resonance as a function of bias , temperature , tunneling exponent and edge velocity .",
    "the tunneling current due to @xmath28 ( discrete ) tunneling sites was calculated in linear response in ref .",

    "fig : longqpc ] for a sketch of the setup .",
    "we assume that the entire bulk has the same filling fraction , and the edges are the modes associated with that bulk state .",
    "in the narrow region under the qlc we do not allow bulk quasiparticles to become trapped .",
    "the form we choose for the tunneling amplitude @xmath37 explicitly contains the aharonov - bohm phase linear in @xmath9 , @xmath38 here @xmath39 is @xmath40 times the number of flux quanta enclosed in the area @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is a measure of the tunneling amplitude strength per unit length , which is assumed to be small enough to warrant the weak - tunneling approximation of linear response .",
    "we included a gaussian envelope to provide a smooth cut - off scale at length @xmath17 ; the gaussian form simplifies the integration over @xmath9 and @xmath43 .",
    "the exact form of the cut - off is not important when @xmath17 is large , and this is the regime we are interested in , because temperature will introduce another , smaller , cut - off length - scale . [ for the case when @xmath17 is not so large ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) , the approximation to @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammax ] ) is less accurate in that the aharonov - bohm phase should not be simply linear , but should contain a quadratic piece to account for the funneling in and out of the tunneling region . ]",
    "one can carry out the integrals over @xmath9 and @xmath43 after recasting the expression for the tunneling current eq .",
    "( [ eq : itun - conntinuum ] ) in terms of the ( inverse ) fourier transforms of @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the heaviside unit - step function and @xmath48 is the euler beta function . in the limit @xmath49 , i.e. , neutral mode much slower than charged mode ,",

    "( [ eq : itunvcinf ] ) reduces to a @xmath55-function that sets @xmath56 ( and a prefactor @xmath57 ) ; in the limit of zero temperature one obtains @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "notice the step function @xmath60 , so that , at @xmath61 , the current vanishes for biases below a threshold set by the resonance .",
    "near the resonance , the current scales as @xmath62 . at large biases ,",
    "far from the resonance , the current scales as @xmath63    next , we consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : itunvcinf ] ) for finite length @xmath17 and non - zero temperature @xmath18 .",
    "we find that either will smoothen the divergence at the resonance that exists for @xmath61 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath65 is a useful quantity to compare different lengths @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of finite temperature is remarkably similar to that of finite length in the sense that we can define a length scale @xmath66 set by temperature such that @xmath67 it was already emphasized by bishara and nayak  @xcite for a two - point contact interferometer that @xmath68 sets a temperature decoherence length scale ; they define a temperature decoherence length as @xmath69 ( for @xmath70 ) .",
    "their definition differs from ours by a factor of order one [ since the two setups are different , exact comparison is not possible ] .",
    "plots of the tunneling current @xmath71 and the differential tunneling conductance @xmath72 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gtunplots ] for the following three quantum hall states : the @xmath1 pfaffian state ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) , the @xmath1 anti - pfaffian state ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath76 ) , and the abelian @xmath0 state ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) . the current and conductance are plotted as a function of bias voltage and at different temperatures as indicated by @xmath66 .",
    "the tunneling current for a qlc is the main result of this paper , we plot the differential tunneling conductance as well because it is the conductance which is usually measured in experiment .",
    "qualitatively the resonance at a qlc is independent of tunneling exponents @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as the plots for the three different states in fig .",
    "[ fig : gtunplots ] show more or less the same behavior : at zero temperature the current and conductance are strictly zero below the resonance and diverge exactly at the resonance bias voltage of the qlc ; at finite temperatures the resonance shows up as a strong peak in the current around the resonance bias voltage ( strong peak followed by dip in the conductance ) which becomes washed out if temperature becomes too high .",
    "note that @xmath82 decays as power - law for @xmath83 , so @xmath84 will be negative here . qualitatively the resonance is a probe of a slow edge velocity .",
    "quantitatively , the tunneling exponents @xmath80 and @xmath81 do affect the detailed shape of the resonance peak at finite temperature , and a precise observation of a resonance not only conveys information about the slow edge velocity but also about the tunneling exponents @xmath80 and @xmath81 . can be probed as well ; however this requires a measurement of the tunneling current _ noise _ in addition to a measurement of tunneling current ( conductance ) . ]",
    "we would now like to address which range of slow edge velocities can realistically be observed , and directly compare with the two - point contact interferometer setup @xcite .",
    "the lower bound is set by temperature ( for both setups ) . for the qlc ,",
    "the scale @xmath85 is the cross - over region where the resonance disappears .",
    "the lower bound @xmath86 on the slow edge velocity is then given by @xmath87 for typical values , @xmath88mk , @xmath89 nm , @xmath90 , @xmath77 , we find @xmath91 m/s .",
    "for the 2pc setup , the interference signal ( which carries the edge velocity signature ) is washed out when the spacing @xmath9 between the two contacts , i.e. , the interferometer arm - length , is smaller than @xmath92 . in current experiments ,",
    "device fabrication limits @xmath93 . with @xmath94 , this gives a lower bound of @xmath95 .",
    "note that the qlc is sensitive to edge velocities up to two orders of magnitude slower compared to the 2pc setup .",
    "an intuitive explanation for this difference is to think of the qlc as an array of point contacts with a very small effective spacing @xmath9 which is much smaller than any spacing @xmath9 that can be fabricated for a 2pc setup .    for both the qlc and 2pc setups , the upper bound on the edge velocity that can be observed",
    "is given by the maximum voltage that can be applied to the quantum hall system without destroying it due to e.g. heating ( a current @xmath96 has to flow through the system ) .",
    "this maximum voltage @xmath97 is not as clear - cut and may depend on sample , specific experimental setup , and filling fraction . in terms of this @xmath97",
    "we have for the qlc setup @xmath98 to give a numerical estimate , for @xmath99 one would find @xmath100 m/s .",
    "the bulk excitation gap @xmath101 likely sets the scale for @xmath97 , but pre - factors are important [ e.g. @xmath102 and @xmath103 differ by a factor 20 ] . for the 2pc setup",
    "our estimate gives @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 ) .",
    "given our estimates of the ( non - overlapping ) ranges of accessible edge velocities , we have to conclude that the qlc and 2pc setups complement each other quite well . a dedicated search for slow edge velocities should implement both setups in order to probe edge velocities from tens to ten - thousands of meters per second .",
    "besides the different ranges of edge velocities , the main difference between the two setups is the signature of the edge velocity : for the qlc it is a _ resonance _ in the tunneling conductance as function of bias , for the 2pc it is a _ modulation _ of the interference signal within the tunneling conductance as function of bias;@xcite detecting a modulation in interference requires an extra experimental knob compared to detecting a resonance .    in this paper",
    "we assume the width @xmath6 of the qlc is constant , but disorder may lead to fluctuations of the width . as long as such fluctuations along the edge",
    "occur on scales larger than the magnetic lenght the resonance should survive , albeit with some broadening of the lineshape . a feature at finite bias observed in device 2 of ref .",
    ", a channel - like geometry , can be due to a resonance , and leads us to expect that the proposed qlc setup is physically realizable .    in summary , we proposed and analyzed a device that can potentially detect the presence of neutral edge modes at the edge of qh liquids , by resolving velocities as small as tens of m / s .",
    "the ability to resolve these modes and measure their velocity of propagation using a qlc ( possibly combined with a 2pc ) can provide a better quantitative understanding of qh edge states , and can help guide attempts to probe quasiparticle statistics , both abelian and non - abelian .",
