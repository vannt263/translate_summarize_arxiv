    "many physical properties of continuous media at low temperatures can be described in terms of quasiparticles .",
    "the quasiparticles of superfluid helium are called phonons , @xmath0 rotons , and @xmath1 rotons .",
    "they have a non - monotonic dispersion curve and the @xmath0 rotons have a negative group velocity , i.e. their momentum is directed opposite to the group velocity , see fig.[fig1 ] . the phonons and rotons",
    "are observed in many experiments , such as in neutron scattering in helium @xcite and in the direct experiments @xcite where beams of superfluid helium quasiparticles are created by a heated solid .",
    "the quasiparticles propagate in the helium , and interact and reflect from different surfaces .",
    "also they quantum evaporate helium atoms from the free surface .",
    "these have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath0 rotons were not detected in direct experiments until 1999 , when they were finally created by a specially constructed source @xcite .",
    "they were observed by quantum evaporation .",
    "all the earlier attempts to create @xmath0 , with ordinary solid heaters , were unsuccessful .",
    "the problem of the interaction of rotons in superfluid helium with interfaces , their reflection , transmission , and mode change , was first considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the method used there did not take into account the simultaneous creation of phonons , @xmath1 and @xmath0 rotons by a phonon in the solid incident on the interface , and it could not distinguish between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 rotons . later in @xcite",
    "it was shown that @xmath0 rotons can not be created at the interface with a solid by a phonon from the solid , provided we can neglect the possibility of creation of the other quasiparticles in the same process at the interface . in the current work a consistent solution is introduced , which allows us to rigorously solve the problem of the simultaneous creation of phonons and rotons .",
    "also it describes in a unified way , the interaction of all @xmath2 quasiparticles with the interface : their transmission , reflection and conversion into each other .",
    "these are the fundamental elementary processes that determine the heat exchange between @xmath2 and a solid , and the associated phenomena , such as the kapitza temperature jump ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate all these phenomena .",
    "the probability of creation of each quasiparticle at the interface is derived for all cases .",
    "the failures of attempts to detect @xmath0 rotons prior to experiments @xcite is explained , and predictions are made for new experiments on the interaction of phonons and rotons with a solid and the creation of @xmath0 rotons at the interface by high energy phonons ( h - phonons ) .",
    "we describe superfluid helium with its distinctive dispersion relation @xmath3 , with the maxon maximum and roton minimum , within the framework of the theory developed in @xcite .",
    "the quantum fluid is considered as a continuous medium at all length scales .",
    "this model is based on the fact that the thermal de broglie wavelength of a particle of a quantum fluid exceeds the average interatomic separation .",
    "then the variables of the continuous medium can only be assigned values , at each mathematical point of space , in a probabilistic sense .    the idea to describe superfluid helium as a continuous medium at microscopic scales has been successfully used for decades .",
    "atkins @xcite used it in the 1950s to describe the mobility of electrons and ions in @xmath2 , when he introduced bubbles and snowballs of microscopic size .",
    "lately the vortices in superfluid helium with cores of sizes of the scale of interactomic distances are being studied extensively , see for example ref.@xcite and the references cited there .",
    "some recent simulations on the dynamics of atoms in helium nanodroplets @xcite also affirm that @xmath2 is well described as a continuous medium at microscopic scales .",
    "as shown in @xcite , application of the methods of theory of continuous medium at microscopic scales demands the relations between the variables of continuous medium to become nonlocal . in the work @xcite",
    ", the nonlocal hydrodynamics was introduced to describe small oscillations in superfluid helium , and in it was used to describe ripplon - roton hybridization and dispersion relation of ripplons .",
    "the nonlocality allows one to analyse a continuous medium with an arbitrary dispersion relation .",
    "this posibility was discussed in @xcite . however , the theoretical justification of this approach remained on the intuitive level until the work @xcite .    in this paper , following @xcite ,",
    "the quasiparticles are described as wave packets propagating in the superfluid .",
    "the long wavelength excitations are phonons , while the short wavelength ones are rotons .",
    "@xmath0 rotons correspond to the descending part of the dispersion curve and have negative group velocity , i.e. they propagate in the direction opposite to their momentum .",
    "this simple model allows us to use the methods of the theory of continuous medium and avoid the difficulties that appear in other phenomenological models , such as .",
    "so , with the help of boundary conditions for the continuous media at the interface , we find the creation probabilities of all the quasiparticles creation when any of them is incident on the interface , as the energy reflection and transmission coefficients for the corresponding wave packets .",
    "the method allows us to obtain the analytical expressions for the probabilities as functions of angles and frequency .    in section 2 of the paper",
    "we formulate the problem and obtain the general solution of the nonlocal equations of the quantum fluid in the half - space .",
    "we consider a parameterised dispersion relation that is a good approximation to the measured dispersion curve of superfluid helium .",
    "the solution is sought in the form that generalizes the solution for a monotonic dispersion of a general form obtained in @xcite .",
    "the consequences of using the boundary conditions are discussed , these include multiple critical angles , backward refraction and retro - reflection ( or andreev reflection @xcite ) of phonons and rotons ( see also ) .    in section 3 the boundary conditions are used to derive both the amplitude and energy reflection and transmission coefficients for any incident wave for arbitrary incidence angles .",
    "the preliminary results for rotons at normal incidence were discussed in the authors report at the conference @xcite .    in section 4",
    "the energy flows through the interface due to phonons , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 rotons are calculated as functions of temperature .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 rotons to the energy flows , in both directions , are shown to be small .",
    "this means that @xmath0 rotons are hardly created by a solid heater and are poorly detected by a solid bolometer .",
    "this explains why @xmath0 rotons could not be detected in direct experiments until the work @xcite .",
    "there they were created by a source made up of two heaters facing each other which allowed mode changes , and detection was achieved by quantum evaporation .",
    "the results obtained in this work can be used in other fields of physics .",
    "in particular they are important for classical acoustics , where the problem of wave transmission through an interface has been solved only for the case when the dispersion relations of both adjacent media are strictly linear ( see , for example , @xcite ) , let alone non - monotonic .",
    "this problem concerning real media , with nonlinear dispersion , was of interest in the middle of the last century @xcite and is still relevant today @xcite .",
    "let us consider two continuous media separated by a sharp interface @xmath4 . in the region",
    "@xmath5 there is an ordinary continuous medium with sound velocity @xmath6 and equilibrium density @xmath7 . for the solid we only take into account longitudinal waves .",
    "taking into account the transverse waves can be done in the same framework of theory of continuous medium and does not present any difficulty .",
    "however , the calculations become much more cumbersome , while on the whole the situation does not change . due to the very small impedance of the solid - helium interface ( see section 2.4 and below )",
    ", the reflection coefficients hardly change at all . for the transmitted waves additional critical angles",
    "appear , corresponding to the sound velocity of the transverse waves .",
    "also it should be noted that taking into account both the longitudinal and transverse waves in the solid allows one to consider the contribution of rayleigh waves , which give contributions to the transmission coefficients of he ii quasiparticles into the solid at fixed incidence angles . for phonons with linear dispersion",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite .. this problem for the helium - solid interface may be the subject of next paper .",
    "the region @xmath8 is filled with the quantum fluid with equilibrium density @xmath9 and dispersion relation @xmath3 such that @xmath10    here @xmath11 is sound velocity at zero frequency , @xmath12 is wave vector that determines the scale of the curve and @xmath13 determines the form of the curve . for a range of parameters ,",
    "this relation is a good approximation to the measured non - monotonic dispersion relation of superfluid helium ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . for @xmath14",
    "there are real @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , which is nonphysical , and for @xmath17 the curve is monotonic . for @xmath18 the curve has the roton minimum at @xmath19 and maxon maximum at @xmath20 as it should .",
    "we adopt the following set of values : @xmath21 m / s , @xmath22 , and @xmath23",
    ". then the dispersion curve has the following parameters : the coordinates of roton minimum @xmath24 and @xmath25 k ( @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant ) ; the maxon maximum is @xmath27 k. these values are the experimentally measured parameters of superfluid helium dispersion curve at the saturated vapor pressure @xcite .",
    "we describe this quantum fluid by nonlocal hydrodynamics as developed in ref .",
    "accordingly , the quantum fluid , as well as the ordinary fluid on the other side of the interface , obeys the linearized equations of continuous media @xmath28 where @xmath29 is hydrodynamic velocity , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the deviations of density and pressure from the respective equilibrium values ( for brevity we refer to them below as just density and pressure ) .",
    "the difference is that pressure and density in the quantum fluid are related through the non - local relation @xmath32 in which the integration domain is the region filled by the quantum fluid @xcite .",
    "the suggested model well describes the interface between superfluid helium and a solid , because for solids the relationships are local . in the frequency range of the dispersion curve of heii , the dispersion laws of most solids , such as the heater materials of copper or gold , are very close to linear and they can be described as ordinary continuous media .",
    "equations ( [ nonlocality ] ) and ( [ contmed ] ) lead to the integro - differential equation for pressure @xmath33 that is set for @xmath34 . in the infinite medium , when the integration and definition domains are infinite , the fourier transform of ( [ eqp ] ) gives us the relation between the fourier transform of the kernel @xmath35 and the dispersion relation of the fluid @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath36 for the dispersion relation ( [ omegarot ] ) we obtain from the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ hk ] ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the poles of @xmath40 in the upper half - plane @xmath41 @xmath42 here the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate and @xmath41 is the upper complex half - plane . due to the last condition , the kernel , eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) , despite the complex notation , is real .",
    "there is no convolution product in eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) , either in the sense of one- or two - sided fourier transform or laplace transform , because the lower limit by @xmath43 is finite while the kernel is symmetrical @xmath44 .",
    "we consider the problem of waves transfering through the interface . as the equations ( [ contmed ] )",
    "are local and coincide with the notation used in the equations of ordinary ideal continuous medium , the two boundary conditions on the interface ( local ! ) are obtained from their integral forms , in the usual way , using the theory of continuous medium : @xmath45 by applying the solutions of the equations of continuous media , on the both sides of the interface , the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) give us the solution in the whole space and thus provide us with all the coefficients of reflection and transmission .",
    "the solution in the solid is well - known , and the solution in the quantum fluid is derived in the following subsection .",
    "the equation that determines the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath46 @xmath47 with @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( [ omegarot ] ) is sixth order with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "its six roots are functions of @xmath46 and are denoted @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "we note that if we used more terms in the polynomial @xmath48 , then the higher order equation for @xmath15 would give 6 real roots and the other roots would be imaginary .    in the problem of waves transfering through the interface , the two boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) can be satisfied for all @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 only if all of the waves present on both sides of the interface have the same frequency @xmath46 and tranverse component of wave vector @xmath54 .",
    "a single monochromatic wave is not a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) . therefore , as there are in total six roots of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq ] ) , we search for the solution as a sum of six monochromatic waves , with the same frequency @xmath46 and transverse component of wave vector @xmath55 ( the @xmath52 axis is chosen along @xmath54 ) , i.e. with the form @xmath56.\\ ] ] here the vectors @xmath57 are @xmath58 the transverse component @xmath55 is real for physical reasons , but @xmath49 and @xmath59 can be either real or complex , as we have to ensure the boundedness of our solution only in the half - space @xmath8 .",
    "after substitution of eq .",
    "( [ psum6 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) , we obtain the system of equations for the amplitudes @xmath60 and the equations for @xmath59 , as functions of @xmath46 and @xmath55 .",
    "the system for @xmath60 is @xmath61 where @xmath62 the equations for @xmath63 are reduced to the form @xmath64    the system of two homogeneous equations for the amplitudes @xmath60 ( [ alpha ] ) ensure that no ( nontrivial ) solutions exist with less than 3 non - zero amplitudes @xmath60 , i.e. there are no eigensolutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) , in the half - space , consisting of less than 3 monochromatic waves .",
    "this is the consequence of the nonlocality , which changes equation ( [ eqp ] ) itself in the presence of the interface . in infinite space , on the contrary , the domain of integration is the whole space , and the equation is solved by the fourier transform , and its solution is a superposition of plane waves with dispersion ( [ omegarot ] ) .    a solution of ( [ eqp ] ) , with the smallest possible number of waves being three , is constructed in the form ( [ psum6 ] ) , with three terms out of six , by picking a subset of any three different roots @xmath65 out of the set of six @xmath66 .",
    "then it can be rewritten with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) in the form that contains a single amplitude : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is chosen so that @xmath69 .",
    "the velocity is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) and ( [ contmed ] ) : @xmath70    as the two conditions ( [ alpha ] ) restrict the number of free amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ psum6 ] ) from six to four , any four linear - independent solutions of the form ( [ p ] ) constitute the basis set of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) for given @xmath46 and @xmath55 , and any solution consisting of 4 , 5 , or 6 monochromatic waves can be represented as their linear combination .",
    "the roots of eq .",
    "( [ dispeq ] ) with @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( [ omegarot ] ) with respect to @xmath71 are @xmath72 for @xmath73 , where @xmath74 are the three dimensionless roots of the cubic equation @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the dimensionless frequency ; @xmath77 are some elaborate complex - valued functions .",
    "the most interesting frequency range is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the dimensionless frequencies that correspond to the roton minimum and maxon maximum respectively . for such frequencies",
    "there are three types of running waves in the quantum fluid , corresponding to phonons , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 rotons .",
    "the branches are numbered in this case in the ascending order of the absolute values of their wave vectors @xmath81 : @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 corresponds to phonons , @xmath84 to @xmath0 rotons , and @xmath85 to @xmath1 rotons .",
    "we now consider the problem of quasiparticles transfer through the interface .",
    "the quasiparticles are treated as wave packets that propagate in the two media .",
    "therefore , when we build the solutions in the quantum fluid , we have to take into account that wave packets , as well as quasiparticles , propagate with their group velocities @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "so , a wave packet of the quantum fluid composed of waves with wave vectors close to @xmath87 , with its length @xmath88 ( so that it is a phonon wave packet ) and the @xmath89th component @xmath90 , propagates away from the interface ; but a wave packet , composed of waves with wave vectors close to one with length @xmath91 ( so it is an @xmath0 roton packet ) and the @xmath89th component @xmath90 , propagates towards the interface .",
    "let us construct the solution in the quantum fluid @xmath92 ( the  out - solution \" ) that is realized when a wave in the solid is incident on the interface .",
    "this solution should contain only such waves that constitute wave packets traveling away from the interface ( i.e. waves with positive group velocity ) or waves that are damped at @xmath93 . picking 3 out of 6 vectors @xmath57",
    "is the same as picking their normal components @xmath59 , as they all have the same @xmath55 .",
    "the six normal components @xmath59 , obtained as solutions of eq .",

    "either both roots are real which occurs for small enough angles @xmath96 , or both roots are imaginary for @xmath97 . in the first case one root corresponds to a wave traveling towards the interface , the other to a wave traveling away from it . the second case , one root gives a damped wave in @xmath8 , while the other gives an exponentially unbounded wave .",
    "so , @xmath92 contains no more than three waves ( and no less because there are no such solutions ) and therefore has the form of eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the squared normal components of the three constituent waves are @xmath98 we define the signs of roots @xmath99 for @xmath92 to be made up of waves with the normal components of wave vectors equal to @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "then taking into account the negative group velocity of @xmath0 rotons @xcite , for the signs of real @xmath99 we obtain @xmath103 and @xmath104 . if @xmath97 for some @xmath95 , the corresponding wave @xmath105 is bounded in @xmath8 for @xmath106 .",
    "then in the general case we have @xmath107 then the out - solution has the form of eq .",

    "we define them in the way , which is illustrated by fig.[fig2 ] . the solution @xmath109 is constructed of waves with @xmath89th components of wave vectors @xmath110 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with the amplitudes related through eqs . ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "solution @xmath111 is constructed of waves with @xmath100 , @xmath112 and @xmath102 .",
    "the last one , @xmath113 contains waves with @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath114 .",
    "then the three sorts of in - solutions , that correspond to the three types of the incident waves , can be written in the form @xmath115 the @xmath116 solution corresponds to the incident wave of type @xmath95 .",
    "so , a linear combination of @xmath92 and @xmath111 consists of one @xmath0 roton wave ( @xmath84 ) that corresponds to the @xmath0 roton wave packet incident on the interface , and all three waves that correspond to the reflected phonon , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 roton wave packets .",
    "the amplitudes of the phonon and @xmath1 roton waves are the sums of the amplitudes of those waves present in both @xmath92 and @xmath111 .",
    "this is the solution in @xmath8 realized when an @xmath0 roton is incident on the interface .",
    "the four solutions ( [ out - solutions ] ) and ( [ in - solutions ] ) are linearly - independent due to their structure and can be used as the basis set of solutions as mentioned at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "for @xmath78 the roots @xmath99 are fully defined by eqs .",
    "( [ kizsquared ] ) and ( [ kzsigns ] ) . for @xmath117",
    "the roots @xmath118 are complex and @xmath119 ; then @xmath101 and @xmath102 are defined so that the roton waves @xmath120 are damped , so @xmath121 . in the limit @xmath122 the phonon waves have almost linear dispersion @xmath123 , and it can be shown that @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "therefore the amplitudes of all roton waves , that contain multipliers @xmath126 and @xmath127 , go to zero , see ( [ p ] ) , and the general solution tends to the ordinary superposition of incident and reflected phonon waves , with wavelengths much greater than the scale of nonlocality @xmath128 .",
    "this limiting case can also be obtained by passing to the longwave limit @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) , thus making it a local wave equation .",
    "the equation ( [ eqp ] ) was solved earlier in work @xcite for the case of arbitrary but monotonic dispersion relation .",
    "the wiener and hopf method was used there , the application to this type of problem was suggested in @xcite and developed in @xcite .",
    "it is much more general and seems to be more rigorous than the method used here , though less straight - forward .",
    "the solution of @xcite can be generalized to the nonmonotonic case and can be shown to yield for the dispersion relation ( [ omegarot ] ) exactly the solutions ( [ out - solutions ] ) and ( [ in - solutions ] ) .    in the work the problem analogous to ( [ eqp ] )",
    "was considered in order to investigate the hybridization of rotons and ripplons . there",
    "the problem in half - space was replaced by the one in the infinite medium with symmetrical extrapolation of the solutions with respect to variable @xmath89 . however , in contrast to the usual differential ( local ) equations , for an integral equation such as ( [ eqp ] ) the solution can not be thus extrapolated symmetrically to z<0 . indeed , if we consider formally the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) in @xmath5 , it would be defined unambiguously by the solution in @xmath8 ( from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) ) , through the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) .",
    "direct substitution shows that the full solution is not even .",
    "this might be the reason that the method gave wrong results near the surface waves threshold and was then rejected ; in the next paper by the authors another approach was used for that problem .      even before applying the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) and finding the solution in the whole space , we can use the fact that two linear boundary conditions for the variables of continuous media are satisfied on the interface and derive a number of important consequences .",
    "first of all , we see that the solution is always constructed in a such a way that there are in total four outgoing ( i.e. reflected and transmitted ) waves ; one in the solid and three in the quantum fluid .",
    "this is because the four conditions on the waves amplitudes , two from eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) and two from eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , can be all satisfied only when there are at least four outgoing waves",
    ". on the other hand , they can be at most four because , either in the formulation of the problem there is only one incident wave , or the requirement that the solution is bounded when some of @xmath99 are complex .        furthermore , the two boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) imply that all of the waves constituting the full solution have the same frequency @xmath46 and tangential component of wave vector @xmath55 . when wave @xmath95 is propagating at angle @xmath130 to the normal to the interface , @xmath131",
    ". then if one of the waves is incident , the corresponding angle and @xmath55 are set and all the other transmission and reflection angles are determined by the generalization of snell s law @xmath132 here @xmath133 are the phase velocities of the corresponding waves , that depend on frequency ; @xmath134 is the wave vector of the wave in the solid and @xmath135 .",
    "the reflection angle for the wave of the same type as the incident one is equal to the incidence angle .    from now on we will consider @xmath136 , as is the case when superfluid helium is adjacent to a solid .",
    "usually even the strong inequality holds .",
    "then we have @xmath137 if a wave from the solid is incident at @xmath138 , it is reflected at the same angle and the three waves are transferred into helium at angles @xmath139 . the @xmath0 roton wave , as opposed to the others , due to its negative group velocity , propagates backward in the tangential direction ( i.e. in the direction @xmath140 , see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "assume a wave @xmath95 is incident from helium at @xmath130 .",
    "then according to eq .",
    "( [ snell ] ) the transmitted wave in the solid has @xmath141 for @xmath142 , and if the incidence angle is greater than the critical value , @xmath143 is imaginary and the wave in the solid is exponentially damped .",
    "thus we obtain the three angles of full internal reflection @xmath144 in the same way there are three new critical angles defined for @xmath145 ( so that @xmath146 ) : @xmath147 if a wave @xmath95 is incident and @xmath148 , then wave @xmath149 ( with @xmath150 ) has @xmath151 and @xmath152 . for @xmath153 @xmath154 ,",
    "the @xmath149-th wave is damped and the corresponding quasiparticle is not created .    in an ordinary fluid , the group velocity of a wave packet is the same as the sound velocity and is constant .",
    "when a wave is incident on the interface the reflected wave has the same wave number and due to preservation of the transverse component of the wave vector @xmath54 , it is reflected forward .",
    "this qualitative picture is maintained in the majority of all known physical systems .",
    "however , when the reflected wave ( or quasiparticle ) is qualitatively different from the incident , another possibility can be realized .",
    "so , when an electron of a normal metal is incident on the interface with a superconductor , it can be retro - reflected and converted into the hole of negative effective mass that travels back along the same line as the incident electron .",
    "this effect was discovered by andreev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and is called andreev reflection or retro - reflection .    in our case when a helium quasiparticle is incident on the interface , three different quasiparticles are created in helium , with corresponding probabilities . if for example an @xmath0 roton is created on the interface , along with other quasiparticles , when a phonon is incident , for the sake of brevity we will refer to this as  the phonon is reflected into @xmath0 roton \" .",
    "while phonons and @xmath1 rotons behave in these processes like ordinary quasiparticles , @xmath0 rotons propagate in the direction opposite to their wave vector , due to the negative group velocity as already mentioned above .",
    "therefore when a phonon or @xmath1 roton is incident on the interface , the phonons and @xmath1 rotons are reflected forward , while @xmath0 rotons are reflected backward , or _",
    "retro - reflected_. in this way the transverse components of wave vectors @xmath54 are all equal .",
    "likewise , when an @xmath0 roton is incident , the phonon and @xmath1 roton are retro - reflected .",
    "thus we have described the effect of andreev reflection of helium phonons and rotons .",
    "if a monochromatic beam of phonons and rotons is incident on the interface at some angle @xmath155 , there will be up to seven reflected beams ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "we denote them as @xmath156 , which means  the beam of quasiparticles of type @xmath149 created on the interface by the incident quasiparticles of type @xmath95 \" .",
    "the beams @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 are reflected forward at the incidence angle @xmath160 , and therefore constitute a single beam @xmath161 .",
    "beams @xmath162 and @xmath163 are also reflected forward , while @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are reflected _",
    "backward_. due to the relations ( [ snell ] ) , the beams @xmath166 and @xmath165 are reflected at angles greater than @xmath160 , and beams @xmath164 and @xmath167 at angles less than @xmath160 .",
    "the reflection angles depend on @xmath168 , which are functions of frequency .",
