    "@xmath3-deuteron compton scattering probes the structure of the deuteron and provides necessary information that may allow the extraction of neutron properties , such as neutron electric and magnetic polarizabilities .",
    "the differential cross section of unpolarized @xmath3-deuteron compton scattering has been measured at incident photon energies of 49 mev and 69 mev with 10% uncertainty @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations based on potential models and taking the nucleon polarizabilities as inputs find reasonably good agreement with data @xcite but are not sufficient to give tight constraints on the nucleon polarizabilities .    in comparison to potential model calculations ,",
    "a model independent , parameter free and analytic computation of unpolarized @xmath3-deuteron compton scattering based on a recently developed nucleon - nucleon effective field theory @xcite was presented in @xcite .",
    "contributions up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the effective field theory expansion including diagrams contributing to the nucleon polarizabilities give excellent agreement with the data at 49 mev and reasonable agreement with the data at 69 mev . at this order ( nlo )",
    ", the agreement with the data is comparable to the agreement between the data and potential model calculations @xcite , while inclusion of the next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) contributions should reduce the theoretical uncertainty from 10% to a few percent level .",
    "in addition to @xmath3-deuteron compton scattering , the effective field theory technique also successfully describes the @xmath4 scattering phase shifts up to center - of - mass momenta of @xmath5 per nucleon @xcite in all partial waves .",
    "the electromagnetic moments , form factors  @xcite and polarizability  @xcite of the deuteron as well as parity violation in the two - nucleon sector  @xcite also have been explored with this new effective field theory .",
    "the results all agree with data ( where available ) within the uncertainty from neglecting higher order effects .    in the case of polarized @xmath3-deuteron compton scattering",
    ", no experiments have been performed so far .",
    "planned experiments at tunl to examine the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule using a circularly polarized photon beam will be the first attempt to study vector polarized @xmath3-deuteron compton scattering .",
    "experiments using tensor polarized targets are also technically feasible .",
    "existing technologies like spin - exchange optical pumping @xcite , which will be applied in the blast polarized @xmath6h and @xmath7h laser driven sources , and free electron lasers can provide high quality polarized deuteron targets and photon beams .",
    "the question is , what kind of physics can be measured in such an experiment ?",
    "is it interesting enough to motivate the experiments ?    theoretically , four vector form factors ( corresponding to the @xmath8 interaction of the deuteron field ) and six tensor form factors ( corresponding to @xmath9 ) are identified in  @xcite with the lower multipole contributions calculated using dispersion relations and potential models . in this paper , we perform an analytic calculation of the differential cross section of the tensor polarized @xmath3-deuteron compton scattering cross section to first non - vanishing order in the effective field theory expansion . at this order ,",
    "the contributions to the cross section from the @xmath9 amplitude are the interference terms between the leading electric coupling diagrams and the subleading single potential pion exchange diagrams or the subleading magnetic moment coupling diagrams .",
    "thus the pion effects are of leading order",
    ". we can further isolate the pion contribution by setting the photon scattering angle to be 90@xmath10 at this angle , only the pion term contributes at this order to the tensor polarized differential cross section .",
    "this provides a clean way to study the photon pion dynamics in the two nucleon sector .",
    "the experimental precision required to measure these effects will also be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the process we will focus on is the low energy ( below pion production threshold ) tensor polarized compton scattering @xmath11 where the incident photon of four momentum @xmath12 in the deuteron rest frame ( lab frame ) scatters off the polarized deuteron target to an outgoing photon of four momentum @xmath13 .",
    "the polarization of photons and final state deuteron are not detected . for convenience",
    ", we will work in the lab frame and choose the @xmath14 direction to be the ( 0,0,1 ) direction .",
    "the scattering amplitude can be written in terms of scalar , vector and tensor form factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 corresponding to the @xmath17 interactions of the deuteron field ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the polarization vectors of the initial and final state deuterons . using the power counting described in @xcite , the scalar form factor @xmath21 contributes to the amplitude starting at leading order ( lo ) in the effective field theory expansion , while the tensor form factor @xmath16 and the vector form factor @xmath22 contribute starting at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) respectively . squaring the amplitude to form the cross section ,",
    "the lo contribution to the cross section only comes from the @xmath23 term which is independent of the deuteron target polarization , while the target polarization dependent @xmath21 and @xmath16 interference term contributes at nlo .",
