    "we now have confirmed redshift measurements to eight gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) : 970228 ( djorgovski et al . , 1999b ) , 970508 ( metzger et al .",

    "although these redshifts have helped provide insight into the energetics of grbs , they have not helped us gain knowledge on the cosmological distribution of grbs as a whole .",
    "this is primarily because the `` luminosity functions '' of these bursts are broad , and mask any cosmological signature .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show the hubble diagram for grbs and their afterglows with known redshifts ( and for which the fluence and flux data is publicly available ) .",
    "there is no obvious hubble relation in any wavelength band , which suggests that we must continue to rely on statistical studies of grbs to gain insight on their global distribution as well as the physical processes at the burst .",
    "log@xmath2-log@xmath3 studies have been extensively used to investigate the spatial distribution of grbs , but one can easily show that any spatial distribution can fit the log@xmath2-log@xmath3 diagram , given some grb luminosity function and a cosmological model ( see e.g. rutledge et al . , 1995 , reichert and mszros , 1997 , mszros and mszros , 1995 , hakkila et al . , 1996 ) .    a more useful way to gain insight into the distribution and energetics of grbs",
    "is to study correlations between various burst spectral and temporal properties . in this paper",
    ", we consider the correlation between a characteristic photon energy , for example the peak of the @xmath0 spectrum , @xmath1 , and fluence or flux .",
    "this can shed significant light on both the distributions and energetics of grbs .",
    "for example , a burst that is further away will be weaker ( assuming little luminosity evolution ) and its spectrum will be redshifted ; thus one would expect a positive correlation between a parameter such as @xmath1 and fluence or flux , if cosmological effects were dominant .",
    "intrinsic effects could either wash out or intensify such a correlation .",
    "mallozzi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) report the presence of a correlation between peak photon flux and @xmath1 , consistent with the cosmological interpretation .",
    "however , the degree of the correlation can be affected by various detector selection biases .",
    "for example , because only the brightest bursts have adequate spectral data , many low intensity grbs near the detection threshold will be missing in the sample of bursts with spectral fits .",
    "this then will introduce a bias against bursts with peak counts near the threshold .",
    "similarly , there may exist biases against high and low values of @xmath1 ( lloyd and petrosian , 1999 ; hereafter lp99 ) .",
    "we investigate how the results are modified by the truncation of the sample due to such biases .    for reasons discussed below ,",
    "we focus our study in particular on total fluence , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 correlations for a sub - sample of brighter bursts .",
    "our main goal is to determine the degree of correlation between these quantities , and investigate to what extent the correlation is due to cosmological redshift and to what extent it is a signature of an intrinsic relation between radiated power and spectral features",
    ". the former signature will be useful for investigations of spatial distributions and evolutionary processes associated with grbs , while the latter will be important in constraining models of energy production and radiation processes in these sources .",
    "we find that there is a strong correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath1 , and that this can be attributed to intrinsic effects , rather than to cosmological expansion or evolution of burst properties .",
    "we will briefly discuss the significance of these results for particular grb models .",
    "getting an accurate handle on the amount of correlation between burst properties proves to be a challenging task , not only because we do not have redshift measurements for most bursts , but because we must account for the various biases and selection effects present in the grb data . because all detectors are sensitive over a finite energy range , and - in the case of batse - are subject to some trigger condition , selection effects are inevitable .",
    "for instance , as shown in lee and petrosian ( 1996 ) and lp99 , the fluence , flux and @xmath1 all suffer from some sort of data truncation imposed by the detector .",
    "as explained below , the detector is most likely to miss the high @xmath1 bursts with low strength ; a bias against high @xmath1 bursts with low fluence or flux will have the effect of producing an apparent positive correlation in the data .",
    "hence , a simple correlation analysis between raw values of @xmath1 and burst strength without the consideration of the data truncation can lead to erroneous correlations .",
    "this will have an important effect on determining whether or not the correlations are intrinsic or due to cosmological redshift ; hence , understanding the type and severity of truncation is necessary before attempting to perform correlation studies . in  2 , we give a brief description of how we estimate the truncation imposed by the selection process , and determine how these truncations affect correlation studies .",
    "further details are presented in the appendix where we describe the non - parametric methods we use for the task at hand . in  3 , we describe the data we use , and in  4 , we present our results for the correlation of @xmath1 with energy fluence and peak photon flux . in  5 , we discuss the implications of these results in terms of cosmological and intrinsic effects . a summary and our conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "we need to understand how the detector thresholds affect the data analysis , and whether or not truncation effects are playing a role in the correlation analysis . here , we focus on the batse detector as an example .",
    "batse will trigger and begin recording data on a burst if the peak photon counts @xmath5 in some finite time interval @xmath6 (= 64 , 256 , or 1024 ms ) and energy range @xmath7 ( between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; usually between 50 and 300 kev ) is greater than @xmath10 , determined by the background in the second brightest detector ( out of eight detectors ) .",
    "this suggests that the detector efficiency is highest for longer duration bursts ( see lee and petrosian , 1997 ) , and for bursts with most of their photons in the range @xmath7 . as discussed in lp99",
    ", we can find the threshold(s ) to any burst characteristic x measured by batse , utilizing the trigger condition .",
    "for each burst , we know x , @xmath5 , and @xmath10 .",
    "we can ask what is the possible range of values of x that this burst can have and still trigger the instrument . in general",
    ", x can have an upper limit @xmath11 , a lower limit @xmath12 , or both limits ; @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "for example , we can determine the detection threshold of the observed energy fluence @xmath14 ( or peak flux @xmath15 ) ; in this case , there is only a lower limit @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "this threshold is obtained from the simple relation ( lee and petrosian , 1996 ) @xmath18 the last equality is valid if the burst s spectrum does not change drastically throughout its duration . for other bursts characteristics ,",
    "such a basic relation may not hold .",
    "for example , the break energy , @xmath19 , or the peak energy , @xmath1 , of the @xmath0 spectrum of grbs has both an upper and lower limit .",
    "the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not related to @xmath22 and @xmath1 in a simple form as above , and thus we require a more complex procedure to determine their values .",
    "this was discussed in detail in lp99 and is summarized below .    to get a qualitative idea of how truncation could come into play ,",
    "consider the following : we characterize the spectra of the bursts by four parameters : the low energy photon power law index , @xmath23 , the high energy index , @xmath24 , the break energy @xmath19 ( or @xmath25 which is the peak of the @xmath26 spectrum when @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , and the normalization factor @xmath29 .",
    "for an example , see equation ( 5 ) in  3 , which is the parameterization used by mallozzi et al .",
    "( 1999 , in preparation ) . given a burst s spectrum @xmath30 , the observed fluence is @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is burst duration ) .",
    "the limiting value(s ) , @xmath33 ( s ) , that @xmath1 can take on and still trigger the batse instrument must satisfy the equation    @xmath34    in general , there will be two values of @xmath33 that satisfy this equation . to find these two solutions , we start with the observed value of @xmath1 ( for which the right side is equal to @xmath14 ) , and increase it ( while keeping @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the total fluence , @xmath35 , equal to their determined values ) until the above equality is reached - that is , until the observed fluence is brought to the level of the threshold .",
    "this value is the upper limit to @xmath1 , @xmath36 .",
    "we then decrease @xmath1 until this equation is again satisfied ; this gives the lower limit @xmath37 .",
    "the choice of what is kept constant depends on the investigation at hand .",
    "we choose to keep the total fluence constant because we are interested in the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 ( for other types of investigations , one might keep , say , the normalization @xmath29 constant ) .",
    "however , in reality , batse triggers on counts , which is the convolution of the impinging photon flux with the detector response matrix , drm .",
    "the drm converts photons of a particular energy into detector `` counts '' over a range of energies .",
    "this allows for the possibility of photons from higher energies to spill over into the `` observed '' energy range . for example , given some @xmath5 and @xmath10 , and the detector response matrix , @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 and @xmath40 index the energy bins for the incident photon flux and counts , respectively ) , the correct value for @xmath33 is obtained from the following expressions :    @xmath41    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the normalization in the spectrum appropriately adjusted to keep the total fluence constant .",
    "in other words , we have the incident photon spectrum characterized by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath1 , and @xmath29 in @xmath44 energy bins of width @xmath7 indexed by @xmath39 . to get the counts in @xmath45 energy bins indexed by @xmath40",
    ", we multiply our photon model vector ( of @xmath39 components ) by the detector response matrix - an @xmath46 matrix , which converts photon flux into a count rate .",
    "we then sum over the energy bins for the count rate , corresponding to detector channels 2 and 3 ( @xmath47 50 - 300kev ) ; this gives us the channel 2 + 3 count rate on which the detector triggers .",
    "equation ( 2 ) , on the other hand , assumes that the drm is strictly diagonal .",
    "hence , the limits obtained based on this equation are only estimates of the true observational limits . including the actual drm would cause some spillover from channel 4 , and contribute to the counts in channels 2 and 3 .",
    "preliminary analysis incorporating the drm for a handful of bursts shows that including the precise detector response tends to increase the upper limit on @xmath1 . in a future publication",
    ", we will present results which show how incorporating the actual shape of the drm affects the limits of @xmath1 . in this paper , we use a sample of bright bursts , which has a narrow distribution of @xmath48 s and consequently requires a small correction due to instrumental biases ( e.g. a delta function distribution requires zero correction ; see also brainerd , 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the truncations on @xmath1 have little effect on the final results of our correlation studies for the chosen sample described in the next section .",
    "nonetheless , we present results in which the effects of the limits on fluence and @xmath1 are taken into account . in the appendix , we present the results on how to perform correlation studies on data which suffer from truncation ; these are based on new non - parametric techniques developed by efron and petrosian ( 1999 ) .",
    "once the truncation of the data is determined , we can then proceed to the investigation of correlations .",
    "our sample consisted of a set of bursts from the 4b catalog ( paciesas et al . , 1999 ) which have 16 channel cont ( continuous ) data . using these data ,",
    "the bursts are fit to a band spectrum ( 1993 ) .",
    "the spectrum is parameterized as follows :    @xmath49 , &    $ e < e_{b}$ \\cr a ( e / e_{b})^{\\beta}{\\rm exp}[\\beta-\\alpha ] , & $ e >    e_{b}$}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is units of @xmath50 . note that for @xmath28 and @xmath27 , @xmath1 is the maximum of @xmath51 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath0 has no maximum and @xmath1 is some characteristic photon energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is always greater than @xmath52 in the fitting process so that @xmath0 always converges for small @xmath53 ; but @xmath24 may exceed @xmath52 which implies the peak of @xmath0 must occur outside the range of detector sensitivity .",
    "the lp99 sample - based on four channel lad data - contains a complete sample of bursts with known @xmath5 and @xmath10 values and therefore has a well defined truncation .",
    "unfortunately the present 16 channel sample ( containing a total of 653 bursts with acceptable fits for the fluence ( time averaged ) fits , and 655 bursts with acceptable fits for the peak flux fits ) - although more reliable in the values of the spectral parameters - does not have a well defined selection criterion .",
    "because the brightest bursts give the best fits , most bursts in this sample with a known @xmath10 value have @xmath54 .",
    "these will obviously suffer less truncation effects than bursts with counts closer to the threshold ; bursts with @xmath5 near @xmath55 will have one or both @xmath33 s near @xmath1 and the truncation will be an important effect .",
    "in other words , the sample of bursts with reliable spectral fits is not complete to within well known limits , and the selection process most probably has introduced complicated truncations .",
    "figures 2a and 2b show the sample of bursts which had spectral fits ( circles ) , and those bursts in the catalog with known @xmath5 and @xmath10 values but no spectral fits ( squares ) , in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 planes , respectively .    as evident , there is not a clear indication of the nature of the selection process . without exact knowledge of this selection criteria ,",
    "we can not account for data truncations properly or determine correlations accurately .",
    "to circumvent this situation , we choose the following sub - samples which have a better defined selection criterion .",
    "we truncate the available data parallel to the axes in figure 2a and 2b , so that the above mentioned uncertainty is minimized .",
    "the truncation chosen here is a compromise which involves trying to get as large a sample ( open circles ) as possible , without too many missing bursts ( black squares ) .",
    "that is , we attempt to minimize the bias without reducing the sample to an unreasonably small size .",
    "there are still a few bursts without spectral fits in this `` complete '' sample ; however , we assume that these few bursts will not significantly alter the final result . for peak flux ,",
    "the truncation was made at @xmath58 ph/(@xmath59 s ) , for the observed fluence ( in the range 50 - 300 kev ) we select a subsample with @xmath60 ergs/@xmath59 , and for the summed fluence ( summed over all four lad channels ( @xmath61 ) ) we select sources with @xmath62 ergs/@xmath59 .",
    "the results of our investigation of the correlation between peak flux and fluences with @xmath1 are summarized in figures 3a and 3b , and in table 1 .",
    "note that @xmath63 is approximately equal to the total fluence of the burst , @xmath64 for @xmath1 s in the energy range that we are dealing with .",
    "the fluences are correlated with the burst _ average _ @xmath1 , while the peak photon flux is correlated with the value of @xmath1 at the time of the peak .",
    "figures 3a and 3b show binned values of @xmath65 versus @xmath15 and @xmath4 , respectively , for the whole sample without any consideration of completeness or detector bias ( dotted histograms ) , as well as our more limited but complete sub - samples ( solid histograms ) .",
    "the @xmath65 versus @xmath15 behavior for the whole sample is in agreement with the results reported by mallozzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on a slightly different sample . while there clearly is a significant correlation ( particularly in the low end of the @xmath15 distribution ) , it is not known how much of this is due to incompleteness of the data or other selection biases .",
    "the more complete sub - sample ( solid histogram ) shows very little correlation .",
    "the kendell s @xmath66 test ( see appendix for further discussion ) results shown in table 1 are in agreement with the impressions from figure 3a and quantify the differences between the whole sample and the sub - sample .",
    "the column labeled _ raw result _ shows the significance of the correlation , @xmath66 , without accounting for truncation of the variables , while the _ corrected result _ uses the techniques described in the appendix to account for these truncations . while the total sample shows @xmath66 values of @xmath67 for the correlation with @xmath15 , the complete sample valid over a limited range of peak flux shows no significant ( @xmath68 ) correlation .",
    "the correction for data truncations alter the results only slightly because of the narrowness of the @xmath1 distribution , as mentioned above .",
    "it should be noted that the lever arm is small and most of the @xmath1 - peak flux correlation _ may _ be contained in the low peak flux bursts ; again , however , this is where the selection bias is the strongest so we can not be certain that this is a real correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "simulation results for the case when truncation eliminates the correlation .",

    "although the significance of the correlation is large for the sample as a whole , figure 3b shows that the functional dependence of the correlation is much stronger for high ( solid histogram ) rather than low valaues of the fluence . again , because of the presence of many bursts without spectral fits in the whole sample , we do not know how accurate the functional form of the correlation in the low end of the fluence distribution is . in what follows , we shall use the truncated sub - sample of figure 2b to search for cosmological signatures , because it shows a significant correlation and is more robust , due to our well defined truncation parallel to the axes in the @xmath56 plane .",
    "[ 3 ]    a least squares fit to log@xmath71 - log@xmath72 of the sub - sample ( solid histogram ) in figure 3b gives a slope of @xmath73 ( solid line ) .",
    "our statistical methods presented in the appendix give a similiar result : we define a new variable @xmath74 and calculate the kendell s @xmath66 statistic for the new variable @xmath75 and @xmath4 as a function of the parameter @xmath76 .",

    "a positive correlation between an observed burst strength ( @xmath15 or @xmath80 ) and @xmath48 follows the trend expected from cosmological effects ; bursts which are further away have lower intensity as well as a lower ( redshifted ) value of @xmath1 .",
    "we now test to see if the observed correlations reported above can be attributed _ fully _ to these effects . we will focus particularly on the @xmath81 results , because - as mentioned above - it is our most robust result , and because the total fluence can be related to the total radiated energy and the redshift of the burst , without any need for the so - called k - correction or correction for duration bias ( lee and petrosian , 1997 ) ; @xmath82^{2})$ ] , where @xmath83 is the total radiant energy ( in the gamma - ray range ) , @xmath84 is the average beaming solid angle , @xmath85 denotes the cosmological model parameters , and @xmath86 with @xmath87 as the usual bolometric luminosity distance .",
    "we also define @xmath88 as the value of the peak of the @xmath0 spectrum in the rest frame of the burst , so that @xmath89 . for the task at hand ,",
    "we need to specify a cosmological model , as well as the distribution function of redshift and intrinsic burst parameters , @xmath90 .",
    "note that because the beaming angle enters always in conjunction with @xmath83 , we assume a delta function distribution of @xmath84 so that it can be eliminated from the distribution function",
    ". this amounts to replacing @xmath83 with @xmath91 .",
    "we also assume that the intrinsic parameters @xmath83 and @xmath88 do not evolve with cosmic time and are not correlated .",

    "implicit in this expression is the cosmological contribution to the correlation between @xmath99 and @xmath4 . to see",
    "if this is the form of the correlation observed in the data , we carry out the following tests : we assume various plausible models for the functions @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , and compute the expected cosmological relation @xmath103 .",

    "only if none remains ( i.e. @xmath77 , where - again - @xmath66 indicates the significance of the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath1 ) , then we can attribute the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath1 to cosmological effects alone .",
    "assuming no intrinsic correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath88 as in equation ( 6 ) , we try several models for the functions @xmath101 , @xmath100 , and @xmath102 .",
    "we assume that @xmath100 is a gaussian with a mean value for @xmath88 of @xmath105 and a dispersion @xmath106 , @xmath101 is either a delta function ( standard candle ) or a power law in the radiated energy , and @xmath102 is either a constant or follows the star formation rate .",
    "we present results for the einstein de - sitter cosmological model , and adopt a hubble constant of @xmath107 ; however , we find the quantitative results are insensitive to the cosmological model we choose .",
    "for example , a vacuum dominated universe with @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( where @xmath110 is the cosmological constant ) , leads us to almost exactly the same results as a matter dominated einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "our general conclusion is that , for the more plausible values of the parameters for this set of distributions , most of the observed correlation can not be attributed to cosmological effects alone , and must be intrinsic to the emission mechanism or produced by additional evolution of the sources .",

    "the natural interpretation in this case is that the observed correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath1 is either caused by the cosmological evolution of one or more of the parameters or is due to an intrinsic correlation between @xmath88 and @xmath133 .",

    "stronger ( weaker ) _ correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 than if there were no evolution of @xmath88 .",
    "we might expect some evolution if @xmath88 depends strongly on the conditions of the circumburst medium ( e.g. , in the external shock model discussed below ) , _ and _ if the medium itself evolved strongly with redshift . to account for the strong correlation we see in the data",
    ", the circumburst medium would have to become more dense with decreasing redshift .",
    "however , we might expect that the progenitors of grbs have approximately the same type of environmental conditions ; for example , if bursts are a result of the death of a very massive star and occur in star forming regions as these models predict , then we expect the circumburst densities to be about same . however , we know too little about the conditions of the environment around the progenitor of grbs to say anything definite about this possibility .",
    "perhaps a more likely scenario is that the intrinsic variables @xmath134 and @xmath88 are correlated .",
    "for instance , the physics of the burst emission may lead to a case in which bursts with more total energy radiate at higher peak energies .    to examine this possibility more closely , we repeat the procedure described in  5.1 assuming a power law parametric form for the intrinsic correlation between @xmath105 , the mean of the @xmath88 distribution , and @xmath83 ; @xmath136 .",
    "we vary @xmath137 until the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 is removed ( @xmath138 ) . for a model as in case 2 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 ( a somewhat broad luminosity function , within the range of the dispersion shown in figure 1b ) , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 sfr , we find that we can remove the observed correlation if @xmath143 . similarly , in the same model except with a _ constant _ density , we find that we can remove the correlation in the data if @xmath144 .",
    "[ clearly an intermediate exponent is expected for the sfr model that is constant for @xmath127 . ]",
    "these results can be used to test models of grb emission , most of which predict some sort of relation between these quantities .",
    "for example , if the emission can be explained by optically thin synchrotron radiation with a power law distribution of electrons , then @xmath88 in the cosmic co - moving frame of the burst can be written ( see , e.g. , pacholczyk , 1970 ) @xmath145 where @xmath146 ( which we assume is @xmath147 ) is the lower cutoff to the electron power law distribution , @xmath148 , @xmath149 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting source , and @xmath150 is the perpendicular component of the magnetic field . to a very rough approximation , we may estimate the radiated energy of the grb as the duration @xmath32 times the total power emitted per electron , integrated over the initial electron energy distribution : @xmath151    \\propto t n_{o } b^{2}\\gamma^{2 }    \\gamma_{m}^{3-p}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 is the thomson cross section , and the expression in brackets is the total power radiated by an electron of lorentz factor @xmath153 .",
    "the last proportionality comes from performing the integration for @xmath154 .",
    "if , for example , in a very simple model where @xmath146 , @xmath32 , and @xmath155 were constant from burst to burst or independent of @xmath150 and @xmath149 , then we would find that @xmath156 , consistent with our results above .",
    "however , this ignores many of the subtleties of the grb emission .",
    "more detailed models which include information about the progenitor and environments around the grb will predict different relationships among the parameters @xmath157 , @xmath32 , @xmath155 , @xmath149 , and @xmath158 and - in particular - relate them to the total radiated energy of the burst in a more precise way than done above .",
    "it is generally agreed that the grb radiation is produced by the action of a blast wave with two basic independent parameters - the total energy , @xmath159 , and the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath149 .",
    "however , whether the gamma - ray emission occurs in external or internal shocks is a matter of dispute . in the _ the external blast wave model _",
    "( see , e.g. , dermer , chiang , and boettcher , 1998 , and reference cited therein ) , both @xmath146 and @xmath157 will be proportional to the bulk lorentz factor so that @xmath160 .",
    "the proportionality constant depends on details such as the circumburst density , shock compression ratio , the fraction of energy that goes into the magnetic field or relativistic electrons , but _ not _ on the other basic parameter of the blast wave - namely , the total energy @xmath159 . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiated energy @xmath161 is assumed to be proportional to @xmath159 with the proportionality constant fairly independent of @xmath149 .",
    "thus , we expect no observed correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 , except for the weak cosmological contribution .",
    "the strong correlation we see in the data is therefore in disagreement with this model .",
    "the above relations are more complicated in an _ internal shock scenario _ ( rees & mszros , 1994 , sari & piran , 1997 ) , because of the presence of additional parameters such as the lorentz factors of the shocked shells , the shells initial separations , the width of the complex of shells , etc .",
    "( see piran , 1999 for a review ) . from equations",
    "( 53 ) , ( 83 ) , and ( 84 ) of piran , one can show that @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the lorentz factor of the internal shock . if again we assume that @xmath164 , with proportionality constant independent of @xmath163 , @xmath149 , etc .",
    ", and that @xmath165 and @xmath149 ( or @xmath163 ) are independent parameters of the model , then we find @xmath166 .",
    "this is consistent with the results presented above ; thus , we may conclude that the analyses presented here favor the internal shock model .",
    "from the few bursts with measured redshifts , it is clear that grbs have a broad luminosity function ( figures 1a and 1b ) ; as a result , direct detection of cosmological signatures is difficult , and requires a large number of grbs with known redshifts .",
    "hence , we must continue to rely on statistical studies of grb properties to look for such signatures . in this paper",
    "we analyze the correlation between observed burst strengths ( peak flux or fluence ) and photon spectrum characterized by the peak energy , @xmath1 , of the @xmath0 spectrum . some or all of this correlation could be due to the combined effects of spectral redshift and source dimming with distance . there has been some evidence for such a correlation .",
    "the data we use for these purposes come from the batse detector on cgro .",
    "our spectral parameters - in particular @xmath1 - are obtained from fits to 16 channel cont data ; the fluences and peak fluxes are taken from the 4b catalog ( paciesas et al . , 1999 ) . in order to get an accurate measure of the correlations present in the data",
    ", we must be sure to account for all types of selection effects present . in lp99",
    ", we discuss the observational thresholds on both @xmath1 and measures of burst intensity and how this might affect correlation studies , and in the appendix of this paper we review the non - parametric techniques that we use to account for data truncations .",
    "however , in addition to these truncation effects , there are subtle selection effects specific to bursts with spectral data .",
    "in particular , the bursts near the instrument s threshold generally do not have sufficient data for a reliable spectral fit .",
    "hence , the existing samples are missing many bursts with peak counts @xmath5 near the threshold @xmath10 .",
    "it is difficult to quantify what the effect of this will be on our correlation studies . to circumvent these additional selection biases , we selected a sub - sample of bright bursts which are fairly complete in terms of @xmath22 .",
    "this sample has a well defined selection criterion , and hence the results we obtain from this sample are more robust and reliable . applying our methods , we find the following results :    \\a ) we find a strong correlation between peak flux and @xmath1 for the whole spectral sample , in agreement with earlier results reported by mallozzi et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "however , the sub - sample of bright bursts selected in figure 2a shows only a marginal correlation between peak flux and @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", we find significant correlations between the burst fluence and @xmath1 for both the whole sample as well as the sub - sample shown in figure 2b . the sub - sample , however , shows a much steeper functional dependence than the whole sample ( figure 3b ) . in our subsequent analysis",
    ", we focus on the total fluence , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 correlation in the sub - sample , because the truncation effects in this sub - sample are better understood , and the investigation of the cosmological interpretation is simplest in this case .",
    "\\b ) we quantitatively test to see if our @xmath167 correlation can be attributed to cosmological effects alone .",
    "this , of course , depends on the cosmological model , intrinsic distributions of the burst parameters , as well as the co - moving rate density of grbs .",
    "we start with the assumption that there are no correlations between intrinsic burst parameters , and that cosmological evolution of these parameters is minimal .",
    "we present results for an einstein - de sitter cosmological model , although similar conclusions are reached in other reasonable cosmological models we have tested .",
    "\\c ) we find that the observed correlation can be explained by cosmological expansion alone if the total radiated energy ( in the gamma ray range ) is constant ( standard candle assumption ) .",
    "this result is independent of the grb rate density , and is fairly insensitive to the distribution of the other intrinsic burst parameters .",
    "however , as mentioned above , a narrow distribution of radiated energy or luminosity is inconsistent with the data from bursts with observed redshifts .",
    "\\d ) for a more plausible , broad luminosity function ( e.g. , a power law distribution @xmath168 ) , we find that neither for a constant co - moving rate density nor for rates proportional to the star formation rate , can the correlation be solely attributed to cosmological expansion .",
    "the expected correlation is essentially `` washed out '' by the broad luminosity function .",
    "\\e ) this implies either the presence of strong evolutionary effects , or an intrinsic correlation between grb properties .",
    "we find that the first possibility is less likely than the second .",
    "we conclude , then , that the observed correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath1 must be primarily due to an intrinsic correlation between the total radiated energy , @xmath169 , and the rest frame peak energy , @xmath88 .",
    "using our methods , we find that for broad luminosity functions , we can explain the observations if the intrinsic correlation obeys a power law , @xmath170 , with @xmath171 , depending on the form of the co - moving rate density .",
    "\\f ) this kind of correlation seems to be a natural consequence of optically thin synchrotron emission by a power law distribution of electrons with lorentz factors greater than some minimum cutoff , @xmath146 . using the results from a detailed modeling of the emission in an external or internal shock model , we find that the internal shock model can explain the strong intrinsic correlation more simply .",
    "these results are based on a sub - sample of bursts with a limited range of intensity .",
    "this range can be expanded and the results can be put on more solid footing by using the complete sample of grbs observed by batse .",
    "this , however , requires a better understanding of the selection effects involved in the entire process of detection and spectral fitting .",
    "these questions will be explored in more detail in a future publication .",
