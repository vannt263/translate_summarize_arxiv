    "let @xmath2 be an algebra and @xmath4 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 _ absorbs _ @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath5 , iff there exists an idempotent term @xmath6 in @xmath2 ( that is , @xmath7 for each @xmath8 ) such that for each @xmath8 and @xmath9 we have @xmath10    the notion of absorption was developed a few years ago by barto and kozik , and immediately found many applications @xcite .",
    "we would particularly like to mention that bulatov s dichotomy theorem for conservative csps @xcite , with a deep and complicated proof ( nearly 70 pages long ) , was reproved using these techniques on merely 10 pages @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , the main idea of absorption is that , when @xmath5 where @xmath1 is a proper subalgebra of @xmath2 , then some induction - like step can often be applied .",
    "this naturally leads to the following question : given a finite algebra @xmath2 and its subalgebra @xmath1 , is it decidable whether @xmath5 ?",
    "this question turns out to be quite hard .",
    "let us mention that the notion of absorption emerged as a generalization of the notion of the so - called near - unanimity term ( in particular : an idempotent finite algebra @xmath2 has a near - unanimity term iff every singleton absorbs @xmath2 ) .",
    "it was asked in 1995 whether the existence of a near - unanimity term in a finite algebra @xmath2 is decidable @xcite , and it took a while to finally prove that it is @xcite ( another interesting point here is that , before this proof appeared , there were some evidences suggesting that the answer is actually negative ) .",
    "some recent results on deciding absorption are given in @xcite ; as expected , the proposed algorithms are quite complex .    in this paper",
    "we show that in semigroups the absorption is much easier to grasp .",
    "namely , for absorption in semigroups , in theorem [ tt1 ] we provide a necessary and sufficient condition that is very easy to check .",
    "after that , we turn to @xmath0-ary semigroups , that is , algebras @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an @xmath0-ary associative operation .",
    "we conjecture an analogue of the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath13 from theorem [ tt1 ] , and we then prove the conjecture in the following cases : when @xmath12 is commutative , when @xmath3 and when @xmath2 is an idempotent ternary semigroup .",
    "let us say a few words on a possible application of these results .",
    "namely , one of the most interesting algebraic results toward the csp dichotomy conjecture of feder and vardi @xcite is the proof that , if a finite relational structure @xmath14 does not admit any so - called weak near - unanimity ( wnu ) polymorphism , then @xmath15 is @xmath16-complete ( see @xcite , where bulatov , jeavons and krokhin gave a different algebraic sufficient condition for @xmath15 to be @xmath16-complete , and @xcite , where marti and mckenzie showed that this condition is equivalent to the nonexistence of a wnu polymorphism ) .",
    "bulatov , jeavons and krokhin conjectured that the other direction also holds , that is , that the existence of a wnu polymorphism compatible with @xmath14 implies that @xmath15 is in @xmath17 ( this is known under the name algebraic dichotomy conjecture ) .",
    "this has been checked for some relational structures of a special form , as well as for all relational structures but given the existence of a wnu polymorphism of a special form , and in all the cases known so far the results agree with the conjecture . in many of these",
    "works the absorption was the key ingredient in the proof ( see , e.g. , the references from the beginning of this section ) .    in particular , by the result of jeavons , cohen and gyssens @xcite , we know that whenever @xmath14 admits a semilattice polymorphism ( a semilattice operation is a binary operation that is idempotent , commutative and associative ) , then @xmath15 is in @xmath17 .",
    "theorem [ tt1 ] from the present paper gives an exact description of when an algebra is absorbed by its subalgebra in the class of algebras with a binary associative operation ( which is a wider class than the class of algebras with a semilattice operation ) .",
    "this provides a direct link between theorem [ tt1 ] and the current line of attack on the dichotomy conjecture .",
    "concerning our generalization to @xmath0-ary semigroups , so far there is no result ( at least up to the author s knowledge ) toward the dichotomy conjecture that directly relates to conjecture [ conj ] in a similar manner ; however , since there are many results of this kind toward the dichotomy conjecture and many researchers are actively working on it , it is not hard to imagine that such a result exists and is just waiting to be discovered , and in fact , conjecture [ conj ] might serve as a motivation for it .    and of course , speaking about the notion of absorption itself , theorem [ tt1 ] and conjecture [ conj ] may shed some light on the ( presently quite unclear ) behavior of absorption , since we now have a natural class of algebras in which the absorption behaves in a very predictable ( but nontrivial ) way .",
    "it might be a very useful research direction to discover whether there is a deeper reason for this nice behavior of absorption in semigroups and ( conjecturally ) @xmath0-ary semigroups , and whether this reason may help to describe the behavior of absorption in other classes of algebras .",
    "the main ( in fact , the only ) theorem in this section is the following one .    [ tt1 ] let @xmath18 be a semigroup , and let @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath5 if and only if @xmath20 and @xmath21 for each @xmath8 , @xmath22 , and there exists a positive integer @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for each @xmath8 .",

    "for any @xmath8 we have @xmath27 , that is , @xmath6 is an idempotent term .",
    "further , for any @xmath8 , @xmath22 , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which proves that @xmath6 is an absorbing term .",
    "( @xmath30 ) : let @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 be an absorbing term . since @xmath6 is an idempotent term , we trivially get that there exists a positive integer @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for each @xmath8 ( in particular , @xmath31 is the length of the term @xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore , we are left to prove that @xmath20 and @xmath21 for each @xmath8 , @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a term in @xmath32 variables , which are named in such a way that the leftmost variable in @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",

    "therefore , @xmath66 together with ( [ aaa ] ) , this gives @xmath20 , which was to be proved .",

    "let @xmath8 , @xmath22 be given , and let us prove that @xmath178 .",
    "we have @xmath284 and @xmath285 . by step 6 , we have @xmath286 and @xmath287 . since , by step 4 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , we conclude @xmath288 further , we have @xmath289 this proves the case @xmath283",
