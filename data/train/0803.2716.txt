    "the evolution of galaxies is a complex process involving angular momentum redistribution , star formation , chemical evolution , feedback and numerous merging events . understanding how and why galaxies have the properties we observe is further complicated by the fact that observations are limited in a number of complicated ways , including dust obscuration and our inability to view a galaxy in all its projections .",
    "one of the key observations of disk galaxy properties is the ubiquitous exponential surface brightness profile ( de vaucouleurs 1959 ; freeman 1970 ) .",
    "freeman , and many others since , modeled galaxies as two component systems with : an inner spheroid where @xmath5 and an outer exponential disk component with @xmath6 .",
    "it is now believed that the inner galaxy components are best modeled by a srsic function , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ( macarthur et al .",
    "2003 ; pohlen & trujillo 2006 , hereafter pt06 ) .",
    "exponential surface brightness profiles have largely been explained as a relic of the initial angular momentum distribution of the gas which collapsed to form the observed stellar disk population ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ; ferguson & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "while the exponential profile is certainly common among disk galaxies , many galaxies deviate significantly from it .",
    "a large percentage of galaxies show a two - component exponential profile with a steep outer region ( pt06 ) . the transition between the two regimes as sometimes been referred to as the truncation or break radius . in order to avoid confusion in notation",
    "we will refer to these profiles as two - component or broken exponentials .",
    "the issue of broken profiles was first addressed by van der kruit ( 1979 ) and while improved observations have led to subsequent refinements in the analysis of these profiles , confusion still remains as to the nature of these profile excursions .",
    "cosmological simulations coupled with semi - analytical models have been able to reproduce many of the observed features of galaxies .",
    "recent high resolution simulations by governato et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with gas cooling and feedback have shown a rotationally supported disk with an exponential density profile can be generated .",
    "however , current models still exhibit striking failures .",
    "for instance , the well - known angular momentum catastrophe may be caused by dynamical friction of infalling gas leading to the loss of angular momentum ( navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ; navarro & steinmetz 1999 ) . smooth mass accretion , additional resolution and angular momentum conservation through feedback processes also yield disks that are too centrally concentrated . producing",
    "a realistic disk galaxy still remains a challenging task for all galaxy modelers ( lake & carlberg 1988 ; katz 1992 ; navarro & white 1994 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; thacker & couchman 2000 ; sommer - larsen et al . 2003 ; governato et al .",

    "cosmological simulations of galaxies have yet to produce pure exponential disk galaxies as seen in nature ( ngc 300 ( bland - hawthorne et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "due to measurement limitations and the fact that the observed outer disks blend into the sky noise especially for face - on orientations , it is difficult to address the origin of double exponential profiles using observations alone .",
    "simulations allow us to examine the evolution of the galaxy in time free of any observational constraints .",
    "however , careful comparisons with observations are still required . while semi - analytical studies and n - body simulations have been performed in this context ( dalcanton , summers & spergel 1997 , hereafter dss97 ; mo , mao & white 1998 , hereafter mmw98 ; van den bosch 2001 , hereafter vdb01 ; debattista et al .",

    "governato et al .",
    "2007 ) , an exhaustive exploration of the full parameter space of galaxy structure models has not yet been attempted .",
    "vdb01 conducted a semi - analytical study of the nature of galaxy density distributions , and focused specifically on the angular momentum catastrophe .",
    "like most treatments that ignore angular momentum exchange between the bulge , disk and halo components , the disks produced by vdb01 were too centrally concentrated in both the stars and gas .",
    "however , the stellar breaks in the exponential profiles were in close agreement with observations due to the use of a star formation threshold .",
    "because the gas distribution was directly related to angular momentum , the subsequent development of a high central density in the disks drove the gas to the inner regions producing outer breaks interior to those observed .",
    "furthermore the models of vdb01 did not produce the observed double exponential profile in the gas and stars , but were rather sharply truncated in the outer regions .",
    "this work addresses the nature of physical two - component profiles in isolated galaxies free of cosmological evolution ( such as merging and accretion ) and whether these profiles can be attributed to dynamical processes in a disk or alternatively to star formation , or indeed both . as noted by d06 , a semi - analytical approach like that of vdb01 ,",
    "can not account for the fundamental role of bars and secular evolution on the profiles .",
    "the pioneering numerical study of d06 was however restricted to a small range of galaxy parameters .",
    "d06 used an n - body approach to examine whether secular evolution could reproduce observed stellar density profiles .",
    "d06 found that the density profiles may evolve considerably over time , particularly under the action of a bar .",
    "furthermore , their study of broken exponentials relied on rigid halo models and also lacked a representation of star formation and feedback . for our study of galaxy density profiles",
    ", we have explored a more extensive parameter space of the dark and baryonic matter in galaxies , with combinations of the structural parameters that control the various observed profile types and how those profiles evolve over time .",
    "our study involves a sensitivity analysis of galaxy models based on five fundamental parameters , the spin parameter , @xmath1 , halo concentration , @xmath9 , mass or virial velocity , @xmath10 , disk mass fraction , @xmath0 , and the presence of a bulge with a mass fraction , @xmath11 .",
    "our study considers strictly isolated galaxies free of gas infall or interactions .",
    "while such models do not accurately represent nature , they enable a clear focus on the physical processes associated with secular evolution , that would otherwise be masked by the addition of merging histories and gas accretion . upon identifying the most significant parameters that control break development , one can then begin to consider a more complete environment ( roskar et al .",
    "2007 , curir et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this research makes use of an n - body / sph code , gadget-2 , developed and made available to us by volker springel ( see springel 2005 for a description of this code ) .",
    "the star formation model uses the parameters of springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) and was held fixed to keep the exploration of the dynamical parameter space manageable .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in  2 we review recent works and discuss our motivations . in  3 , we describe our simulations and the choice of parameter space .",
    "we present our findings in  4 and compare our results with observations in  5 .",
    "a discussion and a summary of our main findings are presented in  6 .",
    "recent theoretical models of galaxy formation have shown that the angular momentum , @xmath12 , is the principal determinant for the observable features of a galaxy ( dss97 ; vdb01 ; hernandez & cervantes - sodi 2006 ; hereafter hs06 ; dutton et al .",
    "dss97 showed that the angular momentum distribution of a galaxy controls the shape of its rotation curve and its overall surface brightness .",
    "low angular momentum galaxies are more centrally concentrated , have high surface brightness ( hsb ) and are globally unstable to the formation of bars and bulges .",
    "conversely , high angular momentum galaxies have greater disk scale lengths , have lower surface brightnesses ( lsb ) and a higher dynamical mass - to - light ratio .",
    "angular momentum is also central to determining if a system is dynamically stable to bar formation ( mmw98 ) .",
    "the early simulations of efstathiou , lake & negroponte ( 1982 ) showed that disks are unstable to bar formation if : + @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the maximum rotation velocity of the disk , @xmath15 is the disk scale length and @xmath16 is the total disk mass . for a given disk mass ,",
    "only a range of spin parameters would produce a stable disk . in the model of mmw98",
    "the stability condition is recast as : + @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions introduced for a self - gravitating disk ( see eqs .",
    "23 , 29 , 34 and 37 of mmw98 ) .",
    "since the effect of disk self - gravity on @xmath15 and @xmath14 is weak , the condition for stability can be approximated by @xmath22 .",
    "thus , a galaxy with a high disk mass fraction and low angular momentum will be dynamically unstable to bar formation .",
    "we contrast this global dynamical stability estimator based on @xmath2 with the local toomre stability criterion in  4.3 .",
    "the maximum specific angular momentum of the baryons in the disk may potentially cause disk breaks . if angular momentum redistribution does not occur in the disk ,",
    "then the outermost stellar radius will reflect the maximum value of the angular momentum of the baryonic material . whether or not a galaxy develops a broken",
    "exponential could be an important indicator of the angular momentum properties of the original halo .",
    "thus , the outer disk could serve as an important diagnostic of properties of the proto - galaxy ( freeman & bland - hawthorne 2002 ) .",
    "several ongoing problems have plagued our understanding of the role of angular momentum in disk formation .",
    "the assumption of angular momentum conservation for the baryonic component is essential to avoid the so - called _ angular momentum catastrophe_. a simple expression of the disk angular momentum is given by @xmath23 ( mmw98 ) .",
    "angular momentum conservation implies that if the disk mass increases , the disk scale length must also decrease ( assuming constant @xmath14 ) , producing small compact galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that angular momentum loss yields disk galaxies that are an order of magnitude too small / compact ( navarro & benz 1991 ) . to prevent angular momentum loss and small disks ,",
    "stellar feedback and ionizing uv background radiation definitely play some role ( thacker & couchman 2001 ; somerville 2002 ; governato et al .",
    "recent work by kauffman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and naab et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which extends the work of okamoto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , have shown that increased numerical resolution also lessens the angular momentum catastrophe . nonetheless , current galaxy models simulated from cosmological initial conditions still fail to reproduce the observed galaxy scaling relations ( gnedin et al .",
    "2006 ; dutton et al . 2007 ;",
    "governato et al .",
    "2007 ; dutton & courteau 2008 ) and more research is needed .",
    "while the light profile of disk galaxies may generally be described by an exponential function , observed profiles are in fact much more complex due to the presence of a bulge , bar , spiral arms and transient features .",
    "freeman ( 1970 ) already distinguished two types of disk profiles : the type i s that are closely exponential over all radii except for the possible presence of a bulge component , and type ii s that display a depression of the surface brightness between the outer bulge and the inner disk .",
    "van der kruit ( 1979 ) and later van der kruit & searle ( 1981 , 1982 ) , found departures from a pure exponential profile at roughly 4 - 5 disk scale lengths .",
    "this range of break radii was later systematically revised to lower values ( 2.2 - 3.6 disk scale lengths ) ( pt06 ) , thanks to a better understanding of observational issues .",
    "specifically , these early studies used edge - on systems since the line of sight integration enhances the surface brightness of a break . however , line of sight integration distributes the light along the exponential decline meaning that the measured scale lengths in projection will systematically be smaller than in the face - on case ( pohlen et al .",
    "2004 ) . for face - on galaxies alone ,",
    "van der kruit ( 1988 ) and pohlen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found mean break radii at @xmath24 and @xmath25 disk scale lengths respectively .",
    "there is considerable controversy surrounding what fraction of galaxies exhibit breaks , due in part to conflicting definitions for breaks and galaxy types .",
    "for instance , unlike freeman ( 1970 ) , pt06 label type ii galaxies as having a break in the outer region ( but those two are not inconsistent ) .",
    "erwin , beckman and pohlen ( 2005 ) also defined type iii galaxies as anti - truncated or upbending systems .",
    "while sky subtraction errors ( underestimated sky level ) could explain away these profiles , bona fide type iii s are associated with galaxy mergers .",
    "since our study focuses on the secular evolution of isolated galaxies , this galaxy type will not be investigated .",
    "proper statistics of truncated systems will be provided elsewhere but suffice to say here that roughly two thirds of observed disk systems exhibit a two - component profile .",
    "it is not surprising that this fraction should match that of barred systems since the bars and profile breaks are intimately connected ( as we shall see in  4.2 ) .",
    "menendez - delmestre et al . (",
    "2007 ) has shown that roughly @xmath26 of all nearby bright galaxies in the ir are barred .",
    "broken exponentials are also ubiquitous at higher redshift .",
    "prez ( 2004 ) found evidence for `` early truncation '' in a sample of 16 galaxies at @xmath27 with an average break radius @xmath28 3.5 disk scale lengths .",
    "six of these distant galaxies had an average break radius @xmath291.8 disk scale lengths .",
    "trujillo & pohlen ( 2005 ) studied 36 face - on galaxies in the hst ultra deep field galaxies of which 21 exhibited a two - component profile with break radii smaller than 1 - 3 kpc from observed local values .",
    "these findings would suggest an increase in galaxy disk sizes by 25% since z @xmath301 ( somerville et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in summary ,",
    "while there is considerable scatter in the frequency of galaxy types and the location of breaks , the fact that so many groups have identified broken exponentials using different samples and different methods , means that breaks are certainly _ real_. any complete theory of galaxy formation and evolution must account for the origin and range of observed surface brightness profiles .",
    "both the early processes of disk assembly , which are dominated by the results of major and minor mergers , and the long term effects of secular evolution play central roles in defining many of the observed features of galaxy surface brightness profile .",
    "non - axisymmetric perturbations , such as those generated by a bar , may play a significant role in shaping the observed light distributions .",
    "as they evolve , bars drive spiral structure producing rings and driving gas to the center of galaxies triggering starbursts ( hohl 1971 ) .",
    "bars are also thought to trigger bulge formation ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "the action of the bar induces resonances in the disk gas ( inner lindblad resonance at the end of the bar and outer lindblad resonance at @xmath30 2.2 bar radii ) , and funnels gas to the inner regions of the galaxy ultimately yielding the formation of a `` pseudo - bulge '' ( kormendy 1993 ; courteau et al .",
    "1996 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "bars have also been linked to broken exponential profiles .",
    "anderson , bagget & bagget ( 2004 ) found from the study of surface brightness profiles for 218 spiral and lenticular galaxies that barred galaxies are four times more likely to exhibit breaks than unbarred ones .",
    "they postulated that unbarred truncated galaxies might be produced by resonances driven by other asymmetries .",
    "they proposed that lopsided features which were identified in 30% of the galaxies by zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) might produce such resonances .",
    "some authors have suggested that broken exponentials may reflect variations in disk intensity due to clumpy star formation , spiral arms or ring - like features ( narayan & jog 2003 ) .",
    "erwin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that 42% of a sample of 66 barred galaxies showed breaks .",
    "they showed that these breaks may indeed be associated with the bar or resonances in the disk .",
    "simulations have also shown that bars can induce a substantial amount of matter redistribution in the outer disk ( athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; valenzuela & klypin 2003 ; d06 ) .",
    "d06 explored the evolution of disks under the presence of a bar and showed that breaks are produced interior to where the bar sheds its angular momentum and carried away by resonantly - coupled spiral arms . while their work highlighted the importance of secular evolution in determining the morphology of galaxies , it only covered a limited parameter space .",
    "our study follows in their footsteps and explores secular evolution in general , not just that induced by bar formation .",
    "there are two favored hypotheses for the physical origin of broken exponentials .",
    "the _ collapse model _ of van der kruit ( 1987 ) links the break radius to the angular momentum of the protogalaxy .",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) , on the other hand , suggested a _ threshold model _",
    "whereby a dynamical critical threshold for star formation yields a visible break in the stellar luminosity profile .",
    "the break radius would be located where the gas density is less than the critical value defined by the toomre criterion ( toomre 1964 ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the radial velocity dispersion of the gas and @xmath33 is the epicyclic frequency of the stars and gas . the origin of a gas cloud that exceeds this critical density may be a product of swing - amplified or shear instabilities , ring instabilities or giant expanding shells in turbulence - compressed regions ( elmegreen & hunter 2006 ) .",
    "stellar disks behave similarly to gaseous disks at long wavelengths ( rafikov 2001 ) .",
    "the description of a two - component disk with a hot stellar fluid and a cold ism fluid is however more elaborate .",
    "wang & silk ( 1994 ) added a contribution of the stellar component to the critical density and expressed the toomre - q parameter for the gas @xmath34 star model as : @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "thus , star formation can only occur in _ locally _ unstable regions of the disk , @xmath37 and the timescale of star star formation is related to the local dynamical time , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the orbital frequency .",
    "@xmath4 also correlates with the star formation rate , with small values implying more rapid star formation ( wang & silk 1994 ) .",
    "vdb01 considered a combination of the collapse and the threshold models in his semi - analytical approach to understand the density distribution of galaxies and the angular momentum catastrophe . in his model ,",
    "the break in the gas density profile is directly related to the angular momentum of the protogalaxy whereas the break radius of the stars is determined by a threshold density predicted by the toomre criterion .",
    "vdb01 inferred that stellar break radii were in good agreement with observations , due to the use of star formation threshold , but his gas breaks had too high a surface density in conflict with observations .",
    "his models predicted a sharp cut - off of the gas close to the radii @xmath40 , where the h@xmath41i column density falls to @xmath42@xmath43 @xmath44 . in real galaxies , however , h@xmath41i gas is found far beyond @xmath40 .",
    "like most treatments that ignore angular momentum exchange between the bulge , disk and halo components , the disks produced by vdb01 were too centrally concentrated in both the stars and gas .",
    "because the gas distribution was directly related to angular momentum , the subsequent development of a high central density in the disks would drive the gas to the inner regions producing an outer break interior to those observed .",
    "another possible explanation for the origin of the exponential profile lies in a mechanism that could drive the stellar profile towards an exponential regardless of the initial gas profile .",
    "the fact that many observed gas profiles depart from an exponential profile at large radii further supports this idea ( ferguson & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "lin & pringle ( 1987 ) first introduced the idea of viscosity to regulate the angular momentum redistribution and radial flows .",
    "viscous models lead to matter funneling into a central concentration and the outer regions , subsequently moving outward , and forming an exponential profile .",
    "ferguson & clarke ( 2001 ) did not acknowledge the development of two - component profiles but , as noted by pohlen ( 2002 ) , their figs . 2 and 5",
    "do show break - like features at 4 - 5 disk scale lengths in agreement with observed values .",
    "the timescale for development of the outer exponential profile can be long , comparable to the star formation timescale ( slyz et al .",
    "2002 ) , especially in cases where the initial disk is highly irregular .",
    "furthermore , irregular galaxies also exhibit exponential profiles , where there is little shear from viscous effects ( hunter & elmegreen 2006 ) .",
    "elmegreen & hunter ( 2006 ) showed that a double exponential profile , in contrast to a sharp cut - off in a single exponential disk profile , could be produced by invoking gas turbulence in the outer regions of the disk . in the inner regions the star formation threshold is responsible for the inner disk component . in the outer regions turbulent compression , which allows for cloud formation and star formation despite sub - critical threshold values , can reproduce observed density profiles of disk galaxies with great fidelity .",
    "their model thus explains the notion that hsb galaxies would have an increased ratio of the break radius to the inner exponential scale length , since unstable regions of the disk would extend further out , as compared to lsb galaxies .    in their n - body",
    "/ sph study d06 found that galaxy density profiles may evolve considerably over time , particularly under the action of a bar .",
    "they surmised that previous investigations based on semi - analytic models ( vdb01 ) had failed to produce breaks since they lacked the necessary development of bars .",
    "angular momentum redistribution was shown to produce both pure exponential profiles and profiles with realistic breaks .",
    "purely collisionless systems matched observations poorly , but the addition of gas and star formation produced much more realistic systems with breaks and mass density excursions from the pure exponential initial disk profile similar to those observed in real galaxies .",
    "d06 stressed that angular momentum can not be trivially related to a distribution of scale lengths , which is often assumed ( dss97 ; mmw98 ) .",
    "rather , the evolution of the density profile after bar formation should depend primarily on the toomre - q parameter .",
    "if q is small , a bar develops quickly .",
    "if the disk is hotter , bar formation is suppressed and the disk scale length remains relatively unchanged .",
    "the process of bar formation is thus directly related to the formation of breaks : the hotter disks that suppress bar formation will also preserve their pure exponential profile .",
    "however , d06 acknowledge that breaks have been observed in unbarred galaxies and postulated that these galaxies may have been excited through some form of interaction ( although typically type iii or upbending profiles are associated with such events ) .",
    "they found that bars could not be destroyed , thus preventing the subsequent development of unbarred truncated galaxy as well .",
    "while their simulations achieved significant resolution , the approximation of purely collisionless dynamics in their break simulations may lack important physics such as the effects of star formation , star formation threshold and feedback ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "they also explored a limited section of the available parameter space , completing only 12 simulations , and focusing on variations of the ratio of the disk scale height to the scale length ( @xmath450.025 - 0.2 ) , the toomre - q parameter ( @xmath4=1 - 1.6 ) , the halo type ( logarithmic or hernquist potential ) , the ratio of halo to disk scale length ( @xmath46 3.3 and 20.8 ) and the srsic index of the disk ( @xmath471.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 ) .",
    "our study explores a more complete parameter space as well as the time evolution of the different features in the disk ( see  3 ) .",
    "d06 s study of breaks also relied on rigid halo models and lacked star formation .",
    "we improve upon these limitations in our models .",
    "building on this body of previous work , we thus investigate the origin of two - component profiles in isolated galaxy disks using n - body / sph methods .",
    "we use an exhaustive grid search to compare the relative importance of the halo parameters including the mass , concentration and angular momentum with disk and bulge parameters .",
    "important physical processes such as star formation and feedback are included in our simulations using the n - body / sph models of sh03 for the gadget-2 code ( springel 2005 ) .",
    "gadget-2 includes a star formation threshold which , unlike d06 , enables us to compare breaks produced by such a threshold with those resulting from matter redistribution in the disk . over half of our simulations",
    "were evolved up to 10 gyr .",
    "our study also addresses the time evolution of mass density profiles and their features . by comparing with observations , we can test the validity of our findings and constrain the parameters that control the observed features in galaxy density profiles .",
    "our simulations rely on the gadget-2 code ( springel 2005 ) with star formation and feedback as described in springel & hernquist ( 2003 )",
    ". the initial conditions of each galaxy model were generated with the initial conditions generator of springel & white ( 1999 ) .",
    "the simulations were computed on the canadian sharcnet facilities at the university of waterloo . to reduce running times",
    "four processors were used in parallel in each simulation and , on average , each simulation required 10 wallclock days to complete .",
    "the softening length was chosen as 0.08 kpc for the star and gas particles and 0.18 kpc for the dark matter particles for all models .",
    "these particular values are sufficiently small so as not to suppress bar formation ( kaufmann et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "gadget-2 uses a multiphase model for star formation which incorporates cooling and supernovae energy injection .",
    "star formation is assumed to convert cold clouds into stars on a characteristic timescale @xmath48 ; a mass fraction , @xmath49 , of these stars are short - lived and die instantly as sne ( sh03 ) .",

    "the temperature of the cold clouds , @xmath64 , and the supernovae mass fraction factor , @xmath49 , are adopted as 1000 k and 0.1 respectively . as sh03 note ,",
    "the results are not sensitive to these values provided @xmath65 k and @xmath66 .",
    "we do not assume a fixed gas mass density , @xmath67 , below which star formation is impeded ; rather , gadget-2 allows for a threshold density , @xmath54 , which is determined via the star formation timescale , @xmath48 , which sets the overall gas consumption timescale .",
    "the star formation timescale , @xmath68 , is chosen by fine - tuning to match the global schmidt law of kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "a detailed overview of the resulting phase evolution between hot and cold gad can be found in sh03 .",
    "the power index on @xmath69 was chosen to fit a value of 1.5 , in order for the star formation to be proportional to the local dynamical timescale .",
    "this adjustment prompts the normalization coefficient to be lowered by a factor of 2 in order for the star formation rate to be unchanged at an intermediate density of @xmath70 m@xmath71 pc@xmath72 .",
    "springel & hernquist ( 2005 ) showed that the best fitting timescale for star formation was 2.1 gyr .",
    "this led not only to a good fit to the kennicutt slope , but also to the observed gas threshold density of @xmath73 m@xmath71 pc@xmath72 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "springel & hernquist ( 2005 ) could not explain why this choice of @xmath68 reproduces both the kennicutt law and the gas threshold simultaneously .",
    "the significance of this , perhaps fortuitous , coincidence remains unclear .",
    "we also note our choice of a 30% gas fraction to allow for sufficient star formation in the disk over a 10 gyr evolution time",
    ".    the use of a star formation threshold will only affect the newly formed stars and not the initial stars in the model .",
    "thus , when drawing comparisons with observations on the nature of a star formation threshold , we focus strictly on newly formed stars .      because density profile breaks typically occur at several scale lengths , a sufficiently high number of particles is required to properly sample the outer disk .",
    "however , the particle number should also allow the numerous simulations to be completed in a reasonable amount of time and yet not compromise any scientific value .",
    "time constraints from our resource allocation lead us to choose a minimum of 1.4 million initial particles in the no - bulge case and 1.6 million initial particles in the presence of a bulge . to assess the impact of resolution on our simulations we also conducted lower resolution simulations , one simulation using 350 000 particles and another using 90 000 particles . fig .",

    "profile features are essentially eliminated in the low resolution case of 90 000 particles ( red ) . in the intermediate range of 350 000 particles ( green ) ,",
    "the break feature is evident , but the outer disk is poorly sampled . the highest achieved resolution can reproduce the break feature and provides adequate sampling in the outer region .",
    "naturally , we have used as many particles as possible , as prescribed by the number of cpu hours available for the project .",
    "d06 used collisionless particle models to investigate the development of a two - component profile .",
    "our study extends this work , not only by considering a broader parameter space but also by including gas particles and star formation . in order to ascertain the effect , if any , of dissipational processes on the radial profiles , we ran several pure collisionless models and models with gas and star formation .",
    "[ col ] shows a comparison of two such models .",
    "the collisionless runs are shown in red , while those with gas and star formation are shown in blue for models after 5 and 10 gyr .",
    "the radial profiles differ in several important ways : ( 1 ) the breaks in the collisionless runs tend to develop further out into the disk ; ( 2 ) more matter is distributed to the inner regions of the disk in the collisionless models ; and ( 3 ) the profiles evolve more rapidly in the collisionless case .",
    "thus , gas and star formation does affect significantly the radial profiles and the development of a two - component profile .",
    "our grid search involved permutations of the basic galaxy parameters listed in table 1 , resulting in a total of 162 galaxy models with gas and star formation ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we focused on the five galaxy parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 as a fundamental base to determine the rotation curve and the mass density profile of a galaxy .",
    "for instance , it is known that the spin parameter , concentration of the halo , and its mass are fundamental to the development of bars within a galaxy ( athanassoula 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , the relationship between disk mass fraction and spin parameter determines whether a galaxy is bar unstable ( mmw98 ) .",
    "finally , a significant concentration of mass in the center of a galaxy , such as classical bulge , can slow the formation of a bar or possibly impede its formation ( van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "all successful simulations were computed for a minimum of 5 gyr , and extended to 10 gyr , computer time and resources permitting .",
    "the minimum evolution of 5 gyr allowed the disk to stabilize and form a substantial amount of stars . following an initial period of transient evolution",
    ", we found that most simulated profiles had settled into a near final configuration after 3 - 4 gyr .    upon completing the full permutations of model parameters",
    ", we also ran a new suite of simulations to examine a finer grid of the parameter space .",
    "this enabled the confirmation and refinement of various trends found with our coarser grid .",
    "we varied @xmath1 from 0.005 to 0.1 in increments of 0.005 for those simulations ( see table 1 and appendix a for details ) .",
    ".grid search parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we discuss the three methods used to determine the break radii of our simulated galaxies .      considering a smooth galaxy density profile ,",
    "the location of the break at the transition between the inner and outer disks may be found in principle at the peak of the second derivative of this profile .",
    "however , simulated ( and observed ) profiles contain many local minima and maxima and the process of finding the peak in the second profile derivative is non - trivial .",
    "hence , we developed a search method for the second derivative which proceeds from the inner regions of a surface density profile outwards to locate the second derivative maximum while avoiding maxima associated with raw ( unsmoothed ) and transient features .",
    "[ [ break - radius - from - the - deviation - from - the - initial - mass - density - profile ] ] break radius from the deviation from the initial mass density profile ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    our second method involves comparing any evolved density profile to its initial profile .",
    "this method is used only for the total and gas profiles , as the new stars have no initial profiles .",
    "this technique can also not be applied to observationally derived density profiles since initial profiles are unknown .",
    "our break identification involves starting from the outermost profile point and stepping inwards towards smaller radii and tagging the location where the current profile deviates steadily ( by more than 1.5 % ) from the initial profile .",
    "a further test for the validity of these two methods is the comparison of the aforementioned break identifications with those estimated by - eye .",
    "the inner break radius is roughly the transition from the outer bulge , if any , to the inner disk ; the outer break radius is the transition between the inner and outer disk components ( see fig .  [ mark ] ) .",
    "the slopes ( inverse scale lengths ) of the inner and outer profile components can be determined and the relative sharpness of the break is computed as the angle , @xmath80 , between the two fitted exponential lines .",
    "[ mark ] shows a total ( stars @xmath34 gas ) mass density profile with the relevant parameters .        while the two numerical methods predicted break points reasonably well",
    ", their locations did not always closely match the estimates by - eye .",
    "[ progcomp ] shows a comparison of the two numerical methods against eye - ball markings for the 10 gyr sample .",
    "the discrepancies are especially acute for snapshots earlier than 3 gyr where transient features persist .",
    "the comparison is significantly better for the 10 gyr models .",
    "while close agreement is seen with gas break estimates , we find a greater dispersion for the total profile measurements .",
    "the numerical techniques are clearly promising and worthy of further investigation .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will rely on eye - ball estimates which , for most simulations , are in close agreement with the numerical predictions ."
