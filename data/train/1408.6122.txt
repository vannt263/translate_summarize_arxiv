    "the aim of this paper is to develop analytic tools in order to design a relevant mechanism for carbon markets , where relevant refers to emissions reduction . for this purpose",
    ", we focus on electricity producers in a power market linked to a carbon market . the link between markets",
    "is established through a market microstructure approach . in this context ,",
    "where the number of agents is limited , standard game theory applies .",
    "the producers are considered as players behaving on the two financial markets represented here by carbon and electricity .",
    "we establish a nash equilibrium for this non - cooperative @xmath0-player game through a coupling mechanism between the two markets .",
    "the original idea comes from the french electricity sector , where the spot electricity market is often used to satisfy peak demand .",
    "producers behavior is demand driven and linked to the maximum level of electricity production .",
    "each producer strives to maximize its market share . in the meantime",
    ", it has to manage the environmental burden associated with its electricity production through a mechanism inspired by the eu ets ( european emission trading system ) framework : each producer unit of emissions must be counterbalanced by a permit or through the payment of a penalty .",
    "emission permit allocations are simulated through a carbon market that allows the producers to buy allowances at an auction .",
    "our focus on the electricity sector is motivated by its prevalence in the emission share ( 45% of the whole emission level worldwide ) , and the introduction in phase iii of the eu ets of an auction - based allowance allocation mechanism . in the present paper , the design assumptions made on the carbon market aim to foster emissions reduction in the entire electricity sector .",
    "our approach proposes an original framework for the coupling of bidding strategies on two markets .",
    "given a static elastic demand curve on the electricity market ( referring to the time stages in an organized electricity market , mainly day - ahead and intra - day ) , we solve the local problem ( just a single time period of the same length for both markets ) of establishing a non - cooperative nash equilibrium for the two coupled markets .",
    "this simplification is justified here , as we aim to raise the condition under which a carbon market would be a real efficient instrument for carbon mitigation policies .",
    "this analysis is conducted for non - continuous and non - strictly monotone supply functions and bidding strategies on both markets in the complete information framework .    while literature on applied game theory to strategic bidding on power markets mainly addresses profit maximization ( see eg @xcite with complete information , @xcite with private information , @xcite with incomplete information ) , our objective function is share maximization .",
    "the equilibria of the coupled markets are based on the full characterization of the equilibrium electricity price ( on the electricity market alone ) .",
    "we prove the uniqueness of the price and shares , for share maximization whereas , to our knowledge this property is not established ( under our hypotheses ) for profit maximization ( see eg @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , share maximization approach deals with profit by making specific assumptions , i.e. no - loss sales , and a tradeoff between the purchase of allowances and the carbon footprint of the electricity generated .",
    "hence , this work is the first attempt on power and carbon markets coupling through game theory approach .",
    "other coupling approaches use , for instance , models that produce dynamics for both electricity and carbon prices jointly , as in @xcite , @xcite .    in section [ sec : market - rules ] , we formalize the market ( carbon and electricity ) rules and the associated admissible set of players coupled strategies .",
    "we start by studying ( in section [ sec : power - market ] ) the set of nash equilibria on the electricity market alone ( see proposition [ propo - nash ] ) .",
    "this set constitutes an equivalence class ( same prices and market shares ) from which we exhibit a dominant strategy .",
    "section [ sec : design ] is devoted to the analysis of coupled markets equilibria : given a specific carbon market design ( in terms of penalty level and allowances ) , we compute the bounds of the interval where carbon prices ( derived from the previous dominant strategy ) evolve .",
    "we specify the properties of the associated equilibria .",
    "in the electricity market , demand is aggregated and summarized by a function @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the quantity of electricity that buyers are ready to obtain at maximal unit price @xmath3 .",
    "we assume the following :    [ ass : demande ] the demand function @xmath4 is non - increasing , left continuous , and such that @xmath5 .",
    "each producer @xmath6 is characterized by a finite production capacity @xmath7 and a bounded and non - decreasing function @xmath8 \\longrightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}^{+}$ ] that associates a marginal production cost to any quantity @xmath9 of electricity .",
    "these marginal production costs depend on several exogenous parameters reflecting the technical costs associated with electricity production e.g. energy prices , o&m costs , taxes , carbon penalties , .",
    "this parameter dependency makes it possible to build different market coupling mechanisms . in the following we use it to link the carbon and electricity markets .",
    "the merit order ranking features marginal cost functions sorted according to their production costs . these are therefore non - decreasing step functions whereby each step refers to the marginal production cost of a specific unit owned by the producer .",
    "the producers trade their electricity on a dedicated market . for a given producer @xmath10 , the strategy consists of a function that makes it possible to establish an asking price on the electricity market , defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 the set of marginal production cost functions",
    "are explicitly given in the following ( see ) ; @xmath13 is the unit price at which the producer is ready to sell quantity @xmath9 of electricity .",
    "an admissible strategy carries out the following sell at no loss constraint @xmath14 a possible example of such strategy is @xmath15 or @xmath16 , where @xmath17 stands for any additional profit .",
    "the constraint guarantees profitable trade and incorporates an aspect of profit maximization ( ie , loss avoidance ) into the market share approach . in what follows , we include this profit constraint in the considered class of admissible strategies .",
    "we define the class of admissible strategy profiles on electricity market @xmath18 as : @xmath19 as a function of @xmath9 , @xmath20 is bounded on @xmath21 . for the sake of clarity , we define for each @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the loss of load cost , chosen as any overestimation of the maximal production costs .    for producer @xmath10 s strategy @xmath25 , we define the associated asking size at price @xmath3 as @xmath26 with @xmath27 . hence @xmath28 is the maximum quantity of electricity at unit price @xmath3 supplied by producer @xmath10 on the market .",
    "we also call @xmath29 the offer function of producer @xmath10 .    [",

    "next , if @xmath43 , for any fixed @xmath3 , we have @xmath44 from which the reverse order follows for the requests .",
    "we shall now describe the electricity market clearing .",
    "note that from a market view point , the dependency of the supply with respect to the marginal cost does not need to be explicit .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we write @xmath45 and @xmath46 instead of @xmath20 and @xmath47 .",
