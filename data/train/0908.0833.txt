    "historically engineering software integration is rather chaotic then planned .",
    "different cad products had been integrated with cae and cam products , matlab had been integrated with simulink etc .",
    "this integration history could be schematically presented in figure [ fig : chaoticinteg ] .",
    "however chaotic way is not optimal way .",
    "for example c++ programming language had been designed chaotically .",
    "languages of next generation ( java , c # ) had been designed by planned way .",
    "c++ does not support automatic garbage collection .",
    "but any present day project should have it .",
    "so big c++ projects contain smart pointers those provide automatic garbage collection .",
    "since smart pointer is not intrinsic c++ feature there exists a lot of versions of smart pointers .",
    "integration of set of projets with different versions of smart pointers has a set of disadvantages . in this case",
    "integrated product is not clear , volume of its code is overloaded etc .",
    "present day programming languages ( java , c # ) support reflection but c++ does not support it .",
    "however reflection is very useful feature for any big project .",
    "so big c++ projects have different versions of reflection emulation .",
    "comparting of intrinsic reflection and reflection emulation is presented in figure [ fig : reflection_implementation ] .        in case of emulation",
    "we have additional code without essentially new functionality .",
    "if we would like integrate a set of projects by such way then we will obtain a lot of lumber . such disadvantage",
    "have any chaotic way of integration . but chaotic way has top - down design alternative . the top - down paradigm is presented in figure [ fig : topdowninteg ] .",
    "let us explain meaning of figure [ fig : topdowninteg ] .",
    "first of all we have pure abstract library devoted to science and engineering .",
    "this library is used by derived libraries devoted to different brunches of science and engineering .",
    "libraries can be abstract .",
    "integration can use other engineering software as third party .",
    "libraries are being used by integrated products .",
    "green , pig and purple color are used for libraries , third party and integrated products respectively .",
    "italic font is used for abstract libraries .",
    "chaotic way interoperability disadvantage is well known .",
    "chaotic way of interoperability of @xmath0 products requires development of @xmath1 adapters .",
    "adapters provide interoperability between objects of any pair of @xmath0 element set . in figure [",
    "fig : interoperability_issues ] ( a ) we have 8 products .",
    "two sided arrows are adapters",
    ".        if we use top - down scheme then we should develop adapters between base object and other objects .",
    "so we should have @xmath0 adapters only .",
    "the base object is 0 - object in figure [ fig : interoperability_issues ] ( b ) .",
    "pure abstract library for science and engineering should have very high level of abstraction .",
    "however this level of of abstraction is already developed in math . in mathematics , category theory deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them : it abstracts from sets and functions to objects linked in diagrams by morphisms or arrows .",
    "high level of abstraction of category theory is explained in @xcite .",
    "this book contains figure [ fig : object_and_arrow ] with following text .",
    "we did not actually say what @xmath2 and @xmath3 are .",
    "the point is that they can be anything you like .",
    "@xmath2 might be a set with @xmath3 its identity function .",
    "but @xmath3 might be a number , or a pair of numbers , or a banana , or the eiffel tower , or even richard nixon .",
    "likewise for @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider application of this abstraction .",
    "database diagram and control systems diagram are presented in figure [ fig : intrinsic_database_controlsystems ]        common features of these diagram are objects and arrows as abstract objects .",
    "figure [ fig : common_database_controlsystems ] presents database and control systems diagram in single framework ( there is no one to one map ) .",
    "now we would like to integrate both diagrams .",
    "integrated diagram is presented in figure [ fig : integrated_database_controlsystems ]        presented on [ fig : integrated_database_controlsystems ] diagram has following meaning .",
    "database contains recorded input signals of control systems .",
    "this diagram enable us to define response of control system .",
    "explanation of idea usefulness is difficult without any implementation .",
    "this idea shall find further development . however a lot of features are already implemented .",
    "these features are presented in figure [ fig : product_hierarchy ] .",
    "presented in figure [ fig : product_hierarchy ] scheme reflects only part of implemented features .",
    "source code can be downloaded from http://www.mathframe.com .",
    "it is worth to note whole product is not a sum of presented in figure [ fig : product_hierarchy ] features only .",
    "these features can interact and interaction make product much more powerful .",
    "this thesis will be shown below by examples .",
    "this hierarchy can inspire some questions .",
    "one of reasonable question is : `` why we need abstract physical field library ? ''",
    "now this software supports physical fields in 3d space .",
    "however this software is declared as universal and should support 2d physical fields in future . and",
    "2d fields library shall be inherited from abstract physical field library .",
    "universality had been provided from the very beginning of development .",
    "demo applications show prospects of further development .",
    "examples of this section are not not related to real science and engineering problems .",
    "these examples are rather textbook which is very facile for idea explanation .",
    "one physical phenomenon acts to another one and there is backward dependence .",
    "this thesis can be exhibited by example presented in figure [ fig : charged_balls ] .",
    "we have two charged balls @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "electrostatic force which act to @xmath5 depends on relative position @xmath5 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "otherwise the relative position as time function depend on motion of @xmath5 and therefore relative position depends on electrostatic force .",
    "common consideration of 6d motion and physical fields make software much more effective .",
    "now we would like simulate motion of @xmath5 .",
    "simulation scheme is presented in figure [ fig : charged_balls_calculation ] .        left part of this picture represents electrostatic field of @xmath4 . objects @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 provide calculations of next formula of electrostatic intensity : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is 3d vector of relative position with respect to charge , @xmath11 is coefficient which depends on charge of @xmath4 and system of units .",
    "this calculation is separated for performance issue .",
    "object @xmath6 calculates @xmath12 , object @xmath7 calculates components of 3d vector @xmath13 and @xmath8 assemblies these components into vector .",
    "all these calculation are used by @xmath14 object .",
    "properties of the @xmath14 objet are presented on figure [ fig : field_object ] .",
    "object ]    these properties have following meaning .",
    "first of all field parameter is output vector of @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : covariant_field ] explains meaning of `` covariant '' term .",
    "if 3d vector is not covariant then its components depend on sensor position only .",
    "covariant vector components depend on both orientation and position .",
    "values of components are projections of geometric vector to sensor s axes of reference .",
    "figure [ fig : covariant_field ] presents two orientations of sensor : blue and green .",
    "projections of field vector @xmath15 are different for these different orientations .",
    "so we have 3d covariant physical field .",
    "the @xmath16 object is a sensor of the field .",
    "the @xmath17 object provides components of field vector obtained by the @xmath16 object .",
    "these components are used in following motion equations of @xmath5 : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are coordinates of @xmath5 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are components of its velocity .",
    "coefficient @xmath2 depends of charge of @xmath5 and system of units .",
    "these motion equations are contained in @xmath30 object . then coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are used by moved reference frame @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath16 object is installed on @xmath31 .",
    "so we have backward dependence .",
    "motion and therefore current position of @xmath31 and @xmath16 depends on current field value .",
    "otherwise current field value depends on current position .",
    "let us make situation more complicated .",
    "new situation is presented on figure [ fig : charged_balls_calculation_relative ]        here we have installed @xmath14 on @xmath32 and added new object @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath33 defines relative motion parameters of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "relative distance is indicated by @xmath34 object .",
    "physical picture remains the same .",
    "we have added indication only .",
    "now let us install @xmath4 on moved platform as it is presented in figure [ fig : charged_balls_motion ]        simulation of this situation is presented on figure [ charged_balls_motion_platform ] .",
    "now @xmath32 is moved and @xmath35 object defines motion low .",
    "the time dependence of distance between @xmath4 and @xmath5 has been changed by following factors .",
    "first of all now @xmath4 which is source of @xmath14 is moved .",
    "its own motion influence on relative distance .",
    "secondly motion of field source influence on field intensity near @xmath5 .",
    "so absolute motion of @xmath5 will be changed .",
    "this factor also influence on the distance .",
    "these facts are physically evident .",
    "i would like to exhibit facilities of such approach from point of view of software user .",
    "the user simply has added motion to @xmath4 and all other dependent factors had been automatically taken into account .",
    "this facility is impossible without integration .",
    "the key feature of space aerodynamics is that spacecraft interacts with molecules which do not collide with each other .",
    "therefore aerodynamic force depends on visible area and does not depend on other parameters of spacecraft shape .",
    "we can use digital image processing for space aerodynamic calculation .",
    "let us consider it for space aerodynamics .",
    "the image of the mir orbital station is presented on figure [ fig : orbital_station ] .",
    "this photo should be filtered for space aerodynamics usage .",
    "this filtering ( digital image processing ) is presented on figure [ fig : orbital_station_digital_processing ] .",
    "the @xmath36 object contains source image and @xmath37 contains filtering result .",
    "other objects contain necessary math .",
    "this sample presents main advantage of integration .",
    "software devoted to space technology only is not effective without digital image processing .",
    "otherwise digital image processing is not effective without advanced math .",
    "algebraic topology is not yet everyday tool of engineer or scientist . now",
    "this branch of science looks rather as exotic .",
    "however exotic tasks are good tests for integrability and universality .",
    "the `` modern math '' has been developed as test of prospects of category theory approach . in this chapter calculation of different topological invariants @xcite",
    "is considered .",
    "let us consider klein bottle @xmath38 and real projective space @xmath39 ( figure [ fig : klein_bottle_and_projective_space ]        homology groups of these spaces can be calculated as homology of following chain complexes @xcite : @xmath40 chain complex of klein bottle @xmath38 and real projective space is presented below : @xmath41 the application representation of it is shown in figure [ fig : klein_bottle_chains ]        chain complex of real projective space @xmath39 is presented below : @xmath42    chain complexes of both spaces are presented in figure [ fig : k_and_r_chains ] .",
    "now we can calculate homology and cohomology groups , homology with coefficients and other invariants .",
    "more details you can find at category theory project http://categorytheory.sourceforge.net/.",
    "here we consider more complicated samples which are related to real engineering problems .",
    "this problems include following disciplines : - advanced mechanics ; - processing of signals ; - statistics ; - system identification ; - control theory ; - celestial navigation ; - astronomy ; - geomagnetism ; - space aerodynamics ; - digital image processing ; - virtual reality .",

    "orbital station ( figure [ fig : orbital_station ] ) is a very complicated mechanical object .",
    "it is not rigid body .",
    "it has solar cell panels .",
    "these panels are elastic .",
    "the station is stabilized by gyros .",
    "moreover station configuration is not constant .",
    "the `` mechanical aggregate '' library had been developed for simulation of similar aggregates .",
    "the library contains aggregate designer . why aggregate designer ?",
    "indeed mechanical equations are well known long time ago . but",
    "software development for simulation of complicated mechanical objects is not quite easy task .",
    "aggregate designer make this task much easier .",
    "aggregate designer is integrated into framework .",
    "this fact enables us provide interpretability of mechanics with physical fields .",
    "so it is easy to simulate action of magnetic fields on mechanical objects .",
    "i will consider this task below .",
    "now we would like to create mechanical model of spacecraft from models of its modules .",
    "typical spacecraft module is schematically presented in figure [ fig : spacecraft_module ]        this module has own coordinates system @xmath43 .",
    "also it has places of connections .",
    "we can connect other modules to this module .",
    "behavior of module is defined by following kinematic parameters : - radius vector @xmath10 ; - velocity @xmath44 ; - orientation quaternion @xmath45 ; - angular velocity @xmath46 .",
    "but module is not rigid in general .",
    "and these parameters are not parameters of module .",
    "these parameters are rather parameters of one point of module . in this article",
    "we suppose that these parameters are parameters of origin of @xmath43 coordinates system . since module is not rigid it has additional degrees of freedom .",
    "these degrees of freedom can be interpreted as generalized coordinates @xmath47 ( @xmath48= 1, ...",
    ",@xmath49 ) . instant state of module is defined by following parameters : @xmath10 , @xmath45 , @xmath50 , ... ,",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 , @xmath52 , ... , @xmath53 .",
    "this parameters will be named state variables .",
    "parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , ... , @xmath57 will be called accelerations .",
    "mechanical equations define accelerations by state parameters .",
    "accelerations near connection can be defined by following way : @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath48 is number of connection .",
    "other variables are matrixes which depend on state variables .",
    "connection of two modules is presented on figure [ fig : spacecraft_aggregate ] .",
    "both modules have equal acceleration near connection .",
    "first module acts to second one by force @xmath60 and mechanical momentum @xmath61 .",
    "similarly second module acts to first one by force @xmath62 and mechanical momentum @xmath63 .",
    "these forces and momentums satisfy following newton equations : @xmath64 @xmath65 mechanical equations of module can be represented by the following way : @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 in these expressions accelerations are independent variables . @xmath69",
    "( @xmath70 ) is force ( mechanical momentum ) of @xmath48- h connected module .",
    "other vector and matrix parameters depend on state variables .",
    "suppose that @xmath71 - h connection place @xmath48-h module is connected to @xmath49 - h connection place @xmath72-h module .",
    "then we have following evident relations : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76    expressions ( [ v_eq ] ) - ( [ c_m ] ) are linear by accelerations system of equations .",
    "this system is fully defined and therefore can be solved . in result",
    "we have mechanical equations of whole aggregate .",
    "it is worth to note that this system is redundant .",
    "if @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is number of freedom degrees of first ( second ) module then system has @xmath79 degrees of freedom .",
    "however aggregate has @xmath80 degrees of freedom . the exist software version that avoid this redundancy .",
    "but i will not describe it in this article .",
    "aggregate designer provides equations of full aggregate automatically .",
    "coefficients of ( [ v_eq ] ) - ( [ c_m ] ) equations are inputs of aggregate designer . in general",
    "these coefficients can depend on states of modules .",
    "there exist a lot of variants .",
    "but we can abstractly define calculation of these coefficients and then provide different implementations .",
    "following types of mechanical modules are implemented : - absolutely rigid body ; - elastic console ; - flywheel ; equations of rigid body are well known and are not present them here . in context of aggregate designer rigid body",
    "has following properties : - mass @xmath71 ; - momentum of inertia @xmath81 ; - number of connections ; - positions and orientations of connections .",
    "these properties can be edited .",
    "elastic console body is a mechanical system of infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "usually math model of this object contains finite degrees of freedom with finite set of valuable harmonic oscillations [ harm_osc ] .",

    "we can define orientation of spacecraft .      since we consider magnetic method gyro momentum of compensation we should have model of earth s magnetic field . but",

    "includes : -mechanical model of spacecraft ; -model of earth s gravity field ; -model of earth s atmosphere ; -model of earth s magnetic field ; -model of celestial navigation ; -model of stabilization system of spacecraft .",
    "stabilization system could not use flywheels only ( see [ sec : adv_mech ] ) .",
    "otherwise there is an obstacle for construction of stabilization system which uses electromagnets only .",
    "electromagnetic momentum is always perpendicular to magnetic induction b. but stabilization requires all directions of control momentums .",
    "so space technology uses double - loop systems which use both flywheels and electromagnets .",
    "let us consider both loops of this system .",
    "first loop ( i name it high frequency loop ) is presented in figure [ fig : high_frequency_loop ]        we use celestial navigation for definition of orientation and optical gyroscope for definition of angular velocity . in result",
    "we have following parameters @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "first three parameters are angle deviations with respect to desired axes x , y , z. following three parameters are angular velocities with respect to same axes .",
    "control momentums are obtained by flywheels .",
    "we have identified spacecraft angular motion model in [ sec : par_ident ] . in accordance to identified model",
    "we develop control law .",

    "i note that control law of high frequency loop is designed in compliance with control theory .",
    "second loop scheme is presented in figure [ fig : low_frequency_loop ]        this loop purpose is limitation of flywheels angular velocities .",
    "sensor of this loop are tachometers of flywheels .",
    "necessary momentum is provided by electromagnets .",
    "it is possible to use different control laws for this loop .",
    "but main idea of these laws is single in this article i have used following control law .",
    "let be @xmath123 is total angular momentum .",
    "then momentum of electromagnets is opposite to @xmath123 . but",
    "electromagnets are not always switched on .",
    "if @xmath124 is too small then electromagnets are switched of .",
    "otherwise if angle between earth s magnetic induction @xmath123 and @xmath123 is too small then electromagnets can not provide substantionally large momentum that is opposite @xmath123 .",
    "therefore if angle between @xmath123 and @xmath125 is too small then electromagnets are also switched off . since action of electromagnets is not continuous i name this loop low frequency loop . here",
    "i explain how magnetic momentum reduces angular velocities of flywheels .",
    "magnetic momentum causes deviation of spacecraft orientation .",
    "high frequency loop tries to eliminate this deviation by changing of angular velocity of flywheels .",
    "high frequency loop tries to eliminate this deviation by changing of angular velocity of flywheels .",
    "since electromagnetic momentum is opposite to @xmath123 changing of angular velocities is reducing of their values .",
