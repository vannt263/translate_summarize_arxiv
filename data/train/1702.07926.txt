    "it is well known that the manifestation of the dynamical aspects of quantum chaos is possible only within its characteristic timescales , the heisenberg time in the regular case and the logarithmic timescale in the chaotic case , where typical phenomena with a semiclassical description are possible such as relaxation , exponential sensitivity , etc @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic timescale determines the time interval where the wave ",
    "packet motion is as random as the classical trajectory by spreading over the whole phase space @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that some authors consider the logarithmic timescale as a satisfactory resolution of the apparent contradiction between the correspondence principle and the quantum to classical transition in chaotic phenomena @xcite . concerning the chaotic dynamics in quantum systems , the kolmogorov ",
    "sinai entropy ( ks  entropy ) @xcite has proven to be one of the most used indicators .",
    "the main reason is that the behavior of chaotic systems of continuous spectrum can be modeled from discretized models such that the ks  entropies of the continuous systems and of the discrete ones coincide for a certain time range .",
    "taking into account the graininess of the quantum phase space due the indetermination principle , non commutative quantum extensions of the ks  entropy can be found @xcite .",
    "thus , the issue of graininess is intimately related to the quantum chaos timescales @xcite . to complete this picture",
    ", it should be mentioned that a relevant property in dynamical systems is the ergodicity , i.e. when the subsets of phase space have a correlation decay such that any two subsets are statistically independent  in time average \" for large times .",
    "this property , that is assumed as an hypothesis in thermodynamics and in ensembles theory @xcite , is at the basis of the statistical mechanics by allowing the approach to the equilibrium by means of densities that are uniformly distributed in phase space . in this sense , in previous works @xcite quantum extensions of the ergodic property were studied , from which characterizations of the chaotic behavior of the casati  prosen model @xcite and of the phase transitions of the kicked rotator were obtained @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to exploit the graininess of the quantum phase space and the properties of the ks  entropy in an ergodic dynamics in order to get an estimation of the logarithmic timescale in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the preliminaries and an estimation of the ks  entropy in an ergodic dynamics is presented . in section 3 we show that this estimation can be extended for the classical analogue of a quantum system in the semiclassical limit . from this estimation and a time rescaled ks ",

    "entropy @xmath24 of the dynamical system is defined as @xmath25 where the supreme is taken over all measurable initial partitions @xmath10 of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the brudno theorem expresses that the ks ",
    "entropy is the average unpredictability of information of all possible trajectories in the phase space .",
    "furthermore , pesin theorem relates the ks  entropy with the exponential instability of motion given by the lyapunov exponents .",
    "thus , from the pesin theorem it follows that @xmath26 is a sufficient condition for chaotic motion @xcite .      by taking @xmath0 as the classical analogue of a quantum system and considering the timescale @xmath27 within the quantum and classical descriptions coincide ,",
    "the definition can be expressed as @xmath28 now since @xmath29 one can recast as @xmath30 finally , from this equation one can express @xmath24 as @xmath31 the main role of the time rescaled ks ",
    "entropy @xmath32 is that allows to introduce the timescale @xmath27 as a parameter",
    ". this concept will be an important ingredient for obtaining the logarithmic timescale .      in dynamical systems",
    "theory , the correlation decay of ergodic systems is one of the most important properties for the validity of the statistical description of the dynamics because different regions of phase space become statistical independent  in time average \" when they are enough separated in time .",
    "more precisely , if one has a dynamical system @xmath33 that is ergodic then the correlations between two arbitrary sets @xmath34 that are sufficiently separated in time satisfy @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath37 the set @xmath39 at time @xmath40 .",
    "this equation expresses the so called _ ergodicity property _ which guarantees the equality between the time average and the space average of any function along the trajectories of the dynamical system .",
    "ergodicity property is satisfied by all the chaotic systems , like chaotic billiards , chaotic maps , including systems described by ensemble theory .",
