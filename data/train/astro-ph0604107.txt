    "while the evolution of the dark matter in the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology is reasonably well understood , the evolution of the baryonic component is much less certain because of the complexity of the relevant physical processes , such as star formation and feedback .",
    "one approach to study the dynamics of baryons in galaxy formation is to use semi - analytic techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) that combine the growth of dark matter halos with simplified parameterizations of the baryonic physics .",
    "while this allows the construction of theoretical models for galaxy formation and chemical enrichment with a large dynamic range , the validity of the assumptions must be ultimately justified by observations and by more detailed theoretical work .",
    "we here adopt the other common approach to study galaxy formation , which is to use direct hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "complementary to the semi - analytic models , they treat the dynamics of baryons in a much more detailed fashion .",
    "many simulation codes have been developed for studying galaxy formation and evolution , not only of isolated systems ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but also for cosmological simulations of individual galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) or of the galaxy population as a whole ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a robust result has been that with the commonly employed , schematic star formation criteria alone , i.e. , converging gas flow , local jeans instability , and short cooling times , the predicted star formation rates ( sfrs ) are higher than what is compatible with the observed luminosity density .",
    "thus feedback mechanisms are in general invoked to reheat gas and suppress star formation .",
    "we include both supernova and hypernova feedback in our hydrodynamical model in this paper .",
    "supernovae inject both thermal energy and heavy elements into the interstellar medium , and by means of supernovae - driven galactic winds , some of these metals can escape from galaxies into the intergalactic medium .    there is observational evidence for galactic winds in star forming galaxies both locally and at high redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of heavy elements in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and intergalactic medium ( igm ) also requires such an ejection mechanism . the mass - metallicity relation and also the color - magnitude relation of early - type galaxies",
    "have been explained as the the result of loss of heavy elements in galactic winds ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between the iron mass in the icm and the luminosity of early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) may also suggest metal ejection from early - type galaxies .    since the presence of heavy elements can increase gas cooling substantially ( @xcite ) , consistent simulations of galaxy formation",
    "must include a treatment of chemical enrichment as well as energy feedback .",
    "however , especially with respect to chemical enrichment , most existing hydrodynamical models are too simplistic to be compared in detail with the real universe .",
    "there are only a few studies that simulate the detailed chemical enrichment by both type ii and ia supernovae ( sne ii and sne ia ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "different types of supernovae produce different heavy elements on different timescales .",
    "although the most abundant heavy element is oxygen which accounts for half of the solar metallicity , this element is hardly detected in observations of stars .",
    "iron , which is another fundamental element observed in the damped lyman @xmath5 ( dla ) systems and the icm , is mainly produced by sne ia .",
    "recently , it has been confirmed that supernovae with ten times the standard kinetic energy exist and produce a certain amount of iron , not only by the observation of individual supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) but also by the elemental abundance ratios of milky way stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "even with the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , three times more energy is ejected on average when such hypernovae ( hne ) are included , which therefore increase the overall strength of supernova feedback substantially .    in the context of hierarchal galaxy formation , a number of important questions should be explained by simulation models , including ( 1 ) the existence of massive galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 2 ) the old stellar populations of massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 3 ) the `` down - sizing '' effect of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , and ( 4 ) the number of spiral galaxies and the detailed morphological mix of galaxies . with our simulations , we can only address questions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) because of limitations in volume and resolution .",
    "note that while more massive halos tend to form at later times in hierarchal clustering , this does not necessarily imply that massive galaxies have younger stars than low - mass galaxies .",
    "this is because the present - day massive galaxies may have formed by the merging of smaller galaxies , i.e.  the assembly time of these systems needs not to be the same as the formation time of their stars . to study this question ,",
    "we will directly analyze when and where stars form in our simulations and we discuss the ages of stellar populations of massive galaxies formed in our models .",
    "it is not clear that the imf is universal , and simulations of the formation of population iii stars appear to suggest a flatter imf or a lack of low - mass stars in low - metallicity environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this uncertainty means that the sfr and the stellar mass can not be uniquely obtained from the observed luminosity .",
    "however , since a flatter imf produces more heavy elements , the metal enrichment history of galaxies can put constraints on their star formation history and imf .",
    "in fact , the observed weak chemical evolution of the igm ( @xcite , @xcite ) and of dla systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) may conflict with a flatter imf .",
    "a detailed treatment of chemical enrichment is required in cosmological simulations . to this end",
    "we will analyze where and how heavy elements are produced and distributed in the gas phase and in stars , using a salpeter imf for definiteness .    in this paper",
    ", we simulate the evolution of gas and stellar systems from cosmological initial conditions , following chemical enrichment from sne ii , sne ia , and hne .",
    "we use the gadget-2 code by @xcite , in which we introduce metal - dependent cooling rates ( @xcite ) and the chemical enrichment model of kobayashi ( 2004 , hereafter k04 ) .",
    "the feedback scheme is slightly modified from k04 , as described in section  2 . in section  3 , as a test of our code , we simulate galactic winds from dwarf spiral galaxies and examine their parameter dependencies .",
    "our cosmological simulations are described in section  4 , where we also discuss their predictions for the star formation history , galactic winds , and the chemical enrichment .",
    "section  5 gives our conclusions .",
    "to construct a self - consistent three - dimensional chemodynamical model , we have introduced various physical processes associated with the formation and evolution of stellar systems into the parallel tree - sph code gadget-2 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which is fully adaptive with individual smoothing lengths and timesteps and uses an entropy - conserving formulation of sph ( @xcite ) .",
    "we include radiative cooling , and photo - heating by a uniform and evolving uv background radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "star formation , feedback from type ii and ia supernovae ( sne ii and sne ia ) , stellar winds ( sws ) , and chemical enrichment are modelled as well , with an implementation that is close to the one in k04 . in brief , the characteristics of this part of our code may be summarized as follows .    1 .",
