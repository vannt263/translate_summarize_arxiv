    "several comments are in order .",
    "\\(i ) we performed analogous calculations for @xmath69 collisions at the top rhic energy and for @xmath70 collisions at the lhc energy .",
    "we found very similar qualitative behavior - in fact at @xmath8 and @xmath7 the following approximate scaling holds for @xmath71 , @xmath50@xmath72where @xmath73 is the radius of the appropriate nucleus , @xmath27 is the center of mass energy and @xmath28 is a proton mass . in the first approximation ,",
    "the function @xmath74 is universal .",
    "( ii ) to check the uniformity of the magnetic and electric fields in each event , we integrated @xmath0 and @xmath1 over the transverse spherical domain @xmath75 ( denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig_aa ] by a grey circle ) , i.e. , @xmath76and analogously for @xmath77 @xmath66 and @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath78 is the radius of the domain which we varied from @xmath79 fm to @xmath80 fm . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_r ] , for @xmath81 fm the ratio @xmath82 is changing from @xmath83 to @xmath84 ( with increasing @xmath78 ) , as compared to @xmath85 at @xmath53 . for @xmath64",
    "fm @xmath86 is changing from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , as compared to @xmath83 at @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio @xmath89 is always very close to @xmath90 , and again the @xmath6 and @xmath4 components of @xmath0 are almost identical to the @xmath6 component of @xmath1 .     as a function of the impact parameter . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are integrated over the transverse domain @xmath75 of radius @xmath78 [ fm ] . for comparison , we also show the ratio at @xmath53 . ]    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_r ] , for small b the ratio @xmath86 weakly depends on the size of the domain in contrast to large b , where the @xmath91 dependence is significant .",
    "we performed our calculation up to @xmath92 fm ( size of the domain equals 4 fm ) , which in peripheral collisions covers almost the whole interaction region . in practical applications to the chiral magnetic effect , the fluctuations of the magnetic field are important only in the region with a characteristic size corresponding to the size of a sphaleron . at least at early stage of a collision , where the influence of the magnetic field is significant , this size is expected to be of the order of 1 fm ( the characteristic size of a sphaleron is less than the magnetic screening length , which is @xmath93 in the weak coupling limit ) .",
    "this suggests , as seen in fig .",
    "5 , that , indeed , @xmath51 are of the same order and should be treated equally in calculations of the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "\\(iii ) in an actual experiment , the reconstructed reaction plane ( the so - called event plane ) is , in general , tilted with respect to the one defined by the geometry of colliding nuclei .",
    "thus a possible experimental measurement that is sensitive to the direction of the magnetic ( electric ) field in each event , will reveal the components @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , that are linear combinations of the original ones @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "this mixing provides an additional reinforcement to our conclusion that the different field components are comparable in magnitude .",
    "\\(iv ) since the electric conductivity is significantly larger than the one associated with the magnetic field ( at least an order of magnitude , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) it is quite clear that the current created by the electric field @xmath102 dominates over the one due to the chiral magnetic effect @xmath103 . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_b ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_e ] we expect the ratio @xmath104 to be maximal for central collisions and minimal ( but still larger than @xmath90 ) for very peripheral collisions .",
    "\\(v ) our results suggest that the strong electric current should not pose a significant problem for the correlation observable @xmath105 proposed in ref .",
    "voloshin:2004vk to measure the chiral magnetic effect . indeed ,",
    "this observable is sensitive to the difference between correlations in - plain and out - of - plain and , in the first approximation , @xmath102 seems to be the same in @xmath6 and @xmath4 directions , in contrast to @xmath103 created in peripheral collisions ( but not in central collision , where we expect @xmath106 ) .",
    "this point , however , should be investigated in more elaborated studies , that take into account realistic temperature- and density- dependence of the electric conductivity .",
    "\\(vi ) in principle , by measuring the charge separation in central collisions one may perform rough estimate of the electric conductivity @xmath107 of the matter created in heavy ion collisions . assuming the dominance of the electric current in charge separation process in central collisions , and estimating effective lifetime @xmath108 and spatial extensions of the hot spot , where the electric field is almost constant and homogeneous @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath110 . here",
    "@xmath111 is the dipole charge and @xmath112 is the area perpendicular to the dipole axis .",
    "this problem is currently under our investigation .",
    "\\(vii ) our estimates of the magnetic and electric fields are valid only at the early stage of the collision . at later stages ,",
    "the magnetic response from the created medium becomes increasingly important tuchin:2010vs , landau8 , and may lead to substantial increase of the magnetic field over the electric one . for quantitative analysis of this effect , more elaborated studies are required  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we argue that owing to the fluctuating proton positions in the relativistic heavy ion collisions , the strength of the magnetic and electric fields are comparable ( both in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the reaction plane ) in the event - by - event analysis .",
    "thus , for the observables , that are sensitive to the electric and magnetic fields , it is essential to take into account event - by - event field fluctuations .",
    "our result in combination with the lattice qcd calculations of the electric and the chiral magnetic conductivities suggest , that the possible charge separation measured separately in - plane and out - of - plane will be dominated by the electric current , which in principle allows to measure the electric conductivity of the hot medium created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , since the electric field is not correlated with reaction plane , the difference between correlations in - plain and out - of - plain in peripheral collisions should be insensitive to the electric field .",
