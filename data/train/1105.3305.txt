    "quantum crystals are characterized by unusually large atomic kinetic energy , lindemann ratio and non - negligible anharmonicity even at low temperatures and high pressures .  @xcite the counterintuitive possibility of simultaneous solid order and superfluidity in solid @xmath0he , the most representative of quantum crystals , has long attracted the interest of both theoreticians and experimentalists .",
    "after several unfruitful experiments to detect superfluid signals in solid @xmath0he , kim and chan reported few years ago the first evidence of non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) both in confined environment  @xcite and in bulk .",
    "@xcite from then on , several other experimental groups ( up to @xmath3 , so far ) have observed ncri using different samples containing small or ultra small @xmath4he concentrations , in a simple crystal or in a polycrystal , and using several annealing schemes .",
    "@xcite there is almost overall agreement of all the data concerning the onset temperature @xmath5  mk at which the superfluid fraction becomes zero , the lowest value corresponding to ultra pure samples ( only 1 ppb @xmath4he ) .",
    "however , the experimental values of the superfluid density reported so far change by more than one order of magnitude ( @xmath6% ) depending on the purity , annealing conditions in which the crystal is grown , etc .",
    "such high dispersion suggests that the superfluid signal observed in solid @xmath0he is probably due to the presence of some defects in the crystal , which could be of different nature : dislocations , vacancies or grain boundaries .",
    "@xcite    on the theoretical side , path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) calculations performed at low temperatures ( down to @xmath7  k ) show that perfect commensurate @xmath2he crystal does posses neither finite superfluid fraction  @xcite nor condensate fraction .",
    "@xcite only non - zero @xmath8 has been estimated in the presence of disorder introduced in the form of a glassy phase  @xcite and of defects like dislocation lines ,  @xcite and vacancies .",
    "@xcite moreover , our recent calculations based on the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method show negligible superfluid fraction of perfect bulk solid @xmath0he at strictly zero temperature .",
    "@xcite these dmc calculations have been performed using a new model of trial wave function which allows simultaneously for spatial solid order and bose - einstein symmetry and with the benefit of a simple use for importance sampling .",
    "it has been shown that the energetic and structural properties of solid @xmath2he can be reproduced very accurately with this trial wave function model when it is used for importance sampling in the diffusion monte carlo method .    in this work",
    ", we extend our study of solid helium to purely two- and quasi two - dimensional geometries relying upon similar computational approaches to the ones used in refs .",
    "the motivation for carrying out the present study is four - fold .",
    "first , relevance of quantum fluctuations is generally enhanced in systems of reduced dimensionality hence possible signatures of superfluidity may be detected more easily .",
    "second , from a computational point of view low - dimensional systems are reasonably affordable so one can explore wide thermodynamic ranges on them .",
    "third , in a recent study  @xcite of strictly two - dimensional solid h@xmath9 we have shown that when the density of particles is reduced down to practically the spinodal point a finite superfluid fraction is observed to appear in the film ; in this work we carry out similar investigations on solid @xmath2he ( that is , in the metastable regime ) in order to unravel possible connections between the density of particles and superfluid fraction",
    ". and fourth , theoretical predictions on low - dimensional model systems can provide valuable understanding on experimental realization of solid helium confined to restricted geometries and also on interpretation of supersolid signatures in general .  @xcite    there is previous work done on the estimation of the ground - state properties of strictly two - dimensional solid @xmath2he .",
    "many years ago , whitlock _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a systematic study of the energetic and structural properties of this system based on the green s function monte carlo approach ( gfmc ) .",
    "posteriorly , gordillo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite estimated the phase diagram of two - dimensional @xmath2he over a range of temperatures and coverages using pimc calculations .",
    "more recently , various authors have reported on the melting transition and dynamical properties of helium films using variational and _ exact _ ground - state methods .",
    "@xcite interestingly , vitali _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated the existence of off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) in 2d solid @xmath2he using the zero - temperature version of pimc adapted to the shadow wave function formalism , the so - called shadow path integral ground - state method ( spigs ) .",
    "in the present article , we provide comparison with respect to the results reported in these previous works and present new predictions as well . in particular , we report on direct estimations of the superfluid fraction in 2d solid helium and its dependence on the density of particles .",
    "we also analyse the superfluid behavior of a quasi two - dimensional crystal , i. e. an ensemble of he atoms confined within a plane but allowed to explore the out - of - plane direction locally , and assess its dependence on the density of particles and degree of confinement . in the quasi two - dimensional case",
    ", we observe the presence of a superfluid signal which coexists with the periodicity of the system .",
    "the remaninder of the article is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we summarize the basics of the dmc method and describe the symmetrized trial wave function model used throughout this work .",
    "next , we report results for the ground - state properties of two- and quasi two - dimensional solid helium .",
    "finally , we present some discussion and the conclusions in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we study the ground - state of two - dimensional solid @xmath0he by means of the dmc method and hamiltonian @xmath10  , with @xmath11 being the number of particles .",

    "sets of configurations ( walkers ) @xmath14 generated with dmc render the probability distribution function ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the ground - state wave function and trial wave function for importance sampling , respectively .",
    "the short - time green s function approximation that we use , and according to which the walkers evolve , is accurate up to order @xmath18 ; technical parameters in the calculations , as for instance the mean population of walkers ( @xmath19 ) and time step @xmath20 ( @xmath21  k@xmath22 ) , have been adjusted in order to eliminate possible bias in the total energy per particle to less than @xmath23  k / atom .",
    "@xcite    customarily , structural and energetic properties of solid @xmath0he are explored with the nosanow - jastrow trial wave function @xmath24 where @xmath11 is the number of particles ( in this work we consider commensurate crystals only so @xmath11 is also equal to the number of lattice sites ) , @xmath25 being a two - body correlation factor accounting for atomic correlations , and @xmath26 a one - body localization factor which accounts for the periodicity in the system by linking every particle to a particular lattice site of a perfect crystal structure .",
    "the wave function @xmath27 leads to an excellent description of the equation of state and structural properties of quantum solids  @xcite but it can not be used to estimate properties which are directly related to the quantum statistics .",
    "the reason of this is that @xmath27 is not symmetric upon the exchange of particles and it misses the quantum statistics of the system .    in a recent work ,",
    "@xcite we have introduced a new type of wave function , @xmath28 , which reproduces crystalline order and fulfills bose - einstein symmetry requirements simultaneously .",
    "this model wave function is expressed as @xmath29 where the product in the second term runs over lattice site indexes .",
    "compact and managable analytical expressions for the drift velocity and kinetic energy derive from eq .",
    "( [ snjtrial ] ) , so @xmath28 is very well - suited for implementation in dmc codes .",
    "this model has proved to perform excellently in the description of bulk solid @xmath2he and also p-@xmath30 in two dimensions .",
    "@xcite the key point in @xmath28 is that the localization factor ( second term in eq .  [ snjtrial ] ) is constructed in such a way that voids originated by multiple occupancy of a same site are penalized ( this feature will be illustrated in brief by a simple example ) .",
    "a similar model , @xmath31 , has been proposed recently by zhai and wu ,  @xcite which is @xmath32 and where the product in the second term runs over particle indexes .",
    "this wave function also fulfills quantum symmetry requirements and is well - suited for dmc purposes , however it does not account for accurate description of quantum solids .",
    "we observe that when @xmath31 is used for importance sampling solid order is not preserved but instead glassy - like configurations are generated in the simulations .",
    "@xcite in fact , substantially better variational energies are obtained in two - dimensional solid hydrogen when using trial wave function @xmath28 instead of @xmath31 ( see table  i in reference  [ ] ) .",
    "similar variational outcomes are also found in two - dimensional solid @xmath2he .",
    "for instance , at density @xmath33  @xmath34 ( @xmath35   ) we obtain @xmath36  k ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 , see next section ) whereas @xmath39  k ( @xmath40 , @xmath38 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 appearing in the exponent of the mcmillan factor , see next section ) .",
    "the poor variational quality of wave function @xmath31 can be understood in terms of the localization factor which , contrarily to what is required to keep solid order , does not penalizes multiple occupancy of a same site . by multiple occupancy of a same site here",
    "we mean large probability of two particles near a same site to get too close one to the other ( that is , as it would be allowed by the jastrow factor alone ) . differences between trial wave function @xmath28 and @xmath31 can be illustrated by a simple example of two particles in a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume the distance between the atomic equilibrium positions to be one , the parameter in the gaussian factors ( @xmath26 ) @xmath43 ( in arbitrary units ) and switch off the jastrow factor .",
    "the value of the square of wave function @xmath28 and @xmath31 , @xmath44 , in the case of pinning one of the particles in one lattice site ( at @xmath45 ) and then move the second particle towards it , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : symmetrized ] . as",
    "one observes in there , the value of @xmath31 at point @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( which correspond to particles placed over different sites and particles placed over the same position , respectively ) is identical , whereas @xmath48  .",
    "moreover , in the event of atomic overlap ( @xmath49 ) the drift force @xmath50 corresponding to wave function @xmath51 is much more repulsive than that of wave function @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , the curve obtained in the @xmath52 case resembles that of a liquid where the localizing factor can be thought of a constant . also it must be noted that the value of @xmath31 is maximum at half the way between @xmath47 and @xmath53 , thus it will promote larger diffusion of the atoms throughout the volume .     and @xmath54 ( jastrow factor equal to unity ) functions in the simple case of two particles moving in one dimension and with lattices sites separated by one arbitrary unity . ]    a symmetrized trial wave function that has been successfully applied to the study of solid @xmath2he is the called shadow wave function ( swf ) , proposed by reatto _",
    "more than twenty years ago .",
    "@xcite in the swf formalism , an array of subsidiary particles ( shadow particles ) is defined and made to interact with the real atoms of the system ; shadow particles are correlated among them and their coordinates are integrated over the whole volume in such a way that bosonic symmetry requirements are fulfilled by construction . at the variational level",
    "the swf has been shown to provide very accurate description of solid and liquid helium .",
    "nevertheless , this kind of trial wave function has never been used for importance sampling in a dmc calculation . in spite of this ,",
    "very recently the swf has been implemented within the path integral ground state ( pigs ) formalism so that variational constraints in principle have been removed .",

    "the radial motion is frozen to zero - point oscillations and the magnitude of @xmath100-fluctuations therefore is related to the length @xmath136 .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : zprofile ] where we plot the atomic @xmath100-density profile calculated in the quasi 2d solid film at @xmath105 and @xmath130 using the pure estimators technique ,  @xcite and compare it with the corresponding normalized gaussian @xmath100-localizing factor entering @xmath146 ( case @xmath144 ) .",
    "we have studied two- and quasi two - dimensional solid @xmath2he at zero temperature by means of the diffusion monte carlo method and using the recently proposed symmetrized trial wave function @xmath28 as importance sampling .",
    "we have estimated the superfluid density fraction of two - dimensional solid @xmath2he at @xmath147 and found that is negligible down to a density of @xmath98 .",
    "importantly , by allowing the atoms to move along the @xmath100-axis we observe the appearance of a superfluid response that coexists with the crystalline order of the system . the magnitude of this response is shown to depend on the degree of @xmath100-axis confinement and the density of particles .",
    "this finding is valuable for the realization and interpretation of more realistic simulations of helium layers adsorbed on carbon - based surfaces , where the interactions with the substrate must be taken into account accurately in order to make rigorous judgements about the existence of superfluidity and/or odlro . in view of the present results for the quasi two - dimensional solid",
    ", it can be suggested that a well - suited system where to observe a finite superfluid signal is the first layer of @xmath2he on top of graphene or graphite  @xcite which stabilizes in a triangular lattice and possesses relatively small density .",
    "work to verify this hypothesis is in progress .",

    "<S> we calculate the value of the zero - temperature superfluid fraction @xmath1 of 2d solid @xmath2he and find that it is negligible in all the considered cases , similarly to what is obtained in the perfect ( free of defects ) three - dimensional crystal using the same computational approach . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , by allowing the atoms to move locally in the perpendicular direction to the plane where they are confined to zero - point oscillations ( quasi two - dimensional crystal ) we observe the emergence of a finite superfluid density that coexists with the periodicity of the system . </S>"
