    "as well - known the balitskii , fadin , kuraev , lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite expresses the elastic amplitude of two off - shell gluons in the high energy limit corresponding to the perturbative qcd resummation of leading logarithms . in terms of transverse coordinates ( fourier transforms of the four external gluon transverse momenta ) , the equation can be schematically written @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( in the case of structure functions @xmath7 ) is the whole rapidity range , @xmath8 the two - dimensional initial gluon momenta and @xmath9 the 2-momentum transfer .",
    "the bfkl integro - differential kernel @xmath10 is known to possess a global conformal @xmath11 invariance @xcite .",
    "the bfkl derivation is made in the framework of the leading log approximation but it is interesting to investigate the more general consequences of the asymptotic conformal invariance , which could be maintained at higher order . indeed ,",
    "for instance , next leading bfkl calculations could preserve an approximate conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "deviations from asymptotic conformal invariance could also be studied by comparison with the results obtained with this assumption .",
    "the solution of the bfkl equation is for the 4-point gluon amplitude . for practical application to the proton structure functions ,",
    "say , the conformal couplings of the bfkl solution with the @xmath3 states of the virtual photon and with the proton have to be explicited .",
    "this is the main purpose of our paper to formulate the most general coupling of external states and discuss the constraints imposed by the conformal symmetry of the bfkl equation .",
    "the conformal symmetry of the bfkl equation @xcite is a powerful tool . knowing that the kernel @xmath10 is invariant in the @xmath11 transformations , it is possible @xcite to solve exactly the bfkl equation by expanding over the @xmath11 unitary irreducible representations which are labelled by two quantum numbers , namely the `` conformal dimension '' @xmath12 and the `` conformal spin '' @xmath13 in the appropriate eigenbasis @xmath10 is diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath14 where @xmath15 and _ p ( ) & = & 2 ( 1 ) -(p+1- ) - ( p+ ) + & = & _ m=0^ \\ { + - } . [ chi ] using the expansion over the whole conformal basis leads to an expression for the structure function as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is obtained from the couplings of the different conformal spin components to the external sources .",
    "the aim of our paper is to discuss these functions @xmath17 taking into account the constraints due to conformal invariance .    in the expression ( [ eq02 ] ) , one usually sticks to the component @xmath18 which gives rise to the `` hard '' qcd pomeron in the leading order bfkl formalism . in phenomenological applications ,",
    "the perturbative coupling of the conformal component @xmath18 to the virtual photon has been known since a long time @xcite and some models of the non - perturbative coupling to the proton have been discussed @xcite .",
    "however , little has been done about higher conformal spins .",
    "they have been considered in two - jet production with large rapidity interval in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite and in the forward jet production in deep inelastic scattering @xcite which correspond to two `` hard '' vertices with similar characteristic scales .",
    "we shall come back to the corresponding perturbative qcd calculations later on in the discussion .",
    "more recently , the general conformal coupling has been formally derived in the eikonal approximation @xcite , leading to interesting selection rules .",
    "but higher spin components were expected to have no practical applications at high energy ( rapidity interval ) since they are at first sight power suppressed in energy .",
    "it is indeed the case for the processes considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , recently , it has been noticed @xcite that the spin component @xmath2 may have a non negligeable impact for processes corresponding to vertices with different characteristic scales and in particular for proton structure functions at moderate and large @xmath19 this is due to a `` sliding '' mechanism which shifts up its effective intercept and thus drastically changes the energy dependence .",
    "the @xmath2 spin component may even be interpreted as the remnant of the well - known `` soft '' pomeron in the high @xmath20 region .",
    "this result is to be put in perspective with the two - pomeron conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the `` soft '' pomeron is considered to be higher - twist , while the `` hard '' pomeron would represent some kind of leading - twist .",
    "hence , it is worth studying in detail the constraints and properties of conformal couplings to qcd pomerons , both from a perturbative ( for the virtual photon ) and non - perturbative ( for the proton ) points of view .",
    "the next section * 2 * is devoted to the general formalism for the coupling to a generic conformal spin component of the bfkl solution . in section * 3 * , we derive the perturbative coupling to the virtual photon wave - function in terms of its @xmath3 configurations and introduce a class of models for the non - perturbative couplings to the proton satisfying appropriate constraints .",
    "then , in section * 4 * , we make a phenomenological application to the two - pomeron conjecture based on conformal spin components of the proton structure functions , which leads to the necessity of a strong azimuthal `` matching '' condition which is discussed in detail .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in * 5*.",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite the virtual photon - proton elastic bfkl scattering amplitude reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 is the quadri momentum transfer squared and @xmath24 @xmath25 is nothing else than the @xmath26 mellin transformed of the two - gluon elastic amplitude verifying the bfkl evolution equation ( see section * 1 * ) . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the so - called _ impact factors _ describing the coupling of the initial states to the gluons .",
    "after straightforward calculations using the conformal basis of eigenvectors @xcite , one may write @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is given in ( [ omega ] ) and @xmath32 are the @xmath11 eigenfunctions @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 in the forward direction ( @xmath36 ) the formula ( [ eq2 ] ) simplifies . after changing variables to @xmath37 and @xmath38 and combining the relations ( see  @xcite ) @xmath39 and ( see  @xcite ) @xmath40 one gets @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a @xmath11 constant given in ref.@xcite and verifying @xmath43    using the relation @xmath44 one finally obtains @xmath45 where one introduces the natural scaling variables @xmath46 for the ( photon ) vertex @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the ( proton ) vertex @xmath49 note that the gamma function prefactors boil down to a factor @xmath50 on the integration line over the imaginary axis @xmath51    let us consider for instance the first components ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "by separation of modulus and azimuthal integration over @xmath53 they correspond to the two first coefficients of the fourier expansion @xmath54    in the case of proton structure functions and specializing to the two first components , one obtains @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xmath57 note a positivity constraint in the case of the eikonal coupling for which  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the probability distribution of the @xmath3 configurations in coordinate space .",
    "hence , a positivity condition @xmath60 holds which leads to @xmath61 however @xmath62 can be negative as it is indeed the case in some processes like forward jet production in dis @xcite .",
    "note also that the positivity constraint does not hold if there are not only @xmath3 configurations in the fock space of the target ( e.g. for the proton ) .",
    "let us first derive the conformal couplings to the virtual photon . in the perturbative qcd framework and for the @xmath18 component , it is possible to derive the couplings from first order ( virtual ) gluon- ( virtual ) photon fusion graphs , thanks to the @xmath63-factorization property @xcite .",
    "our aim is to start from these results and derive the corresponding coupling to higher spin components .",
    "in fact , for the simple reason of the spin @xmath50 of the virtual photon , only the conformal spin @xmath2 can be obtained from the transverse polarization components of the photon .",
    "interestingly , the factorization properties of qcd in the high - energy regime can be put into two equivalent forms @xcite . as sketched in fig.1",
    ", the perturbative may be soft enough to be included in the non - perturbative input . in that case the two pictures lead to two different parametrizations .",
    "] coupling of the virtual photon to a dipole can be described by two different factorized formulae .",
    "one way is to use the @xmath63-factorization property @xcite which relates the @xmath4-dipole cross - section to the product of the impact factors @xmath64 by a @xmath65-dipole cross - section where @xmath65 is an off - mass - shell gluon .",
    "another equivalent way is to use the photon wave - function formalism  @xcite which uses the @xmath3-dipole cross - section where the @xmath3 configurations are defined by the virtual photon wave function .",
    "the target dipole is considered to be small ( or massive ) in order to justify the ( resummed ) perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "we shall thus make use of the relation ( see fig.1 and ref .",
    "@xcite ) between the impact factors and the wave - functions  @xcite of the transverse photon in terms of @xmath3 configurations for both helicities .",
    "this relation reads  @xcite for @xmath18 @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 is the factorized coupling of the off - mass - shell gluon to a dipole  @xcite .",
    "the light - cone wave functions of the transverse photon @xmath69 for helicity @xmath70 and @xmath71 for helicity @xmath72 are  @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the bessel function . by definition @xmath75 and",
    "the normalization is @xmath76    now , for an arbitrary combination of both helicities , one finds contributions to two fourier components in azimuthal angle ( see ( [ components ] ) ) , namely @xmath77 normalizing to @xmath78 it is easy to realize that the two linearly polarized components @xmath79 give opposite contributions to the component @xmath80 the coupling to the linearly polarized photon are obtained by inserting the appropriate @xmath81-dependent factor in the expression of the wave function contribution to the @xmath2 component .",
    "projecting on the @xmath82 azimuthal fourier component , one writes @xmath83 or , noting that the only difference between the two components come from the @xmath81-dependent factors , @xmath84 one finally gets : ( _ t^(p=0 ) + _ t^(p=1 ) ) & ~ & ( r^2q^2)^1- dz ( z^2+(1-z)^2 + 2z(1-z ) ) ^2 k_1 ^ 2 ( r ) + & = & 2 ^ 1 - 2 ( + 1 )  .",
    "[ phis ] using ( [ p1 ] ) and the relation ( [ relation ] ) , it is easy to write down the similar relation for the impact factors @xmath85    as we just saw , the perturbative photon couplings to the non zero conformal spins requires a non zero linear polarization of the @xmath3 wave - function of the transverse photon to be dynamically active in the reaction . in other terms , the @xmath86 bfkl component requires a maximal azimuthal correlation while the @xmath18 one is completely decorrelated azimuthally .",
    "partial azimuthal ( de)correlation can be obtained by a mixture of different bfkl components",
    ". this will in general depend on the dynamical features of the overall reaction .",
    "for instance @xcite , forward jet production in dis can lead to some azimuthal correlation at small rapidity interval where the higher spin component @xmath86 are still present .",
    "however the general prediction is a significant azimuthal decorrelation due to the strong dominance of the @xmath18 component in this case .    in the case of proton structure functions , however , the `` sliding mechanism '' is able @xcite to promote the higher spin components , especially for @xmath87 to be still important at high energy ( and relatively low @xmath20 ) and thus to keep rather strong azimuthal correlations present in that region .",
    "this implies a discussion of the non - perturbative couplings .",
    "an important remark is that the `` sliding mechanism '' is also expected for perturbative couplings when a large ratio exists between the characteristic scales of both vertices",
    ". it would thus also be interesting to study such processes where we would predict an increase of the azimuthal correlations accompanying the expected `` sliding mechanism '' .",
    "the non - perturbative couplings , e.g. to the proton , are in general beyond our present theoretical knowledge .",
    "it is already true for the leading @xmath18 conformal components , where there are some ambiguities  @xcite in the way one is able to factorize the perturbative from the non - perturbative couplings .",
    "this is all the more true for the non - leading @xmath2 component which , to our knowledge , are for the first time studied for proton structure functions in the present paper . for the sake of definiteness , we will follow some reasonable theoretical and phenomenological requirements which we now indicate :    \\i ) the interaction of the proton are governed ( at small @xmath88 ) by its @xmath3 configurations .",
    "this can be interpreted as color dipole configurations @xcite .",
    "compared with those of the virtual photon , their quantum fluctuations around the proton size @xmath89 are expected to be smaller .",
    "\\ii ) the coupling of the proton will be asked to obey the `` sliding mechanism '' , that is to verify the convergence and analyticity properties found in ref.@xcite . in particular",
    ", no singularity with @xmath90 should appear in the @xmath82 coupling .",
    "\\iii ) within conditions i ) and ii ) , the @xmath18 ( @xmath91 in ( [ components ] ) ) and @xmath82 ( @xmath92 in ( [ components ] ) ) couplings will be assumed to be equal up to a normalization which will be determined phenomenologically and represent the necessary degree of _ azimuthal correlation _ for practical relevance .",
    "\\iv ) concerning the abovementionned sign ambiguity of the @xmath82 vertices , it is removed for the contribution to structure functions which ought to be positive .",
    "thus the product of the photon and proton vertices is considered to be positive .",
    "we shall now propose a convenient class of parametrizations of the proton couplings @xmath93 in equations ( [ vertices],[components ] ) satisfying the requirements i)-iv ) .",
    "noting @xcite the relation @xmath94 we are led to choose @xmath95 eventually , one may vary the peaking of the distribution around @xmath96 by changing the values of @xmath97 it is interesting to note that for @xmath98 the gauge invariance constraint @xcite @xmath99 is automatically verified .",
    "one can also multipoly by a polynomial expression in @xmath100 this can be used to satisfy the constraints , in particular the analyticity ones by cancelling poles at @xmath101",
    "as already mentionned , the non - zero conformal spin components are generally neglected in the phenomenology related to the bfkl equation .",
    "indeed , at ultra - high energy @xmath102 the structure function components in formula ( [ eq02 ] ) are driven by the saddle - points at @xmath103 it is easy to realize that the corresponding intercepts @xmath104 are all negative for @xmath105 in the same time their effective anomalous dimension @xmath106 means that they all contribute to a leading - twist behaviour .",
    "however , it has been remarked in ref . @xcite that at large but finite values of @xmath6 or @xmath20 the corresponding saddle - points _ slide _ away from @xmath107 and generate contributions with very different @xmath6 and @xmath20 behaviour from the ultra - asymptotic ones .",
    "in particular the @xmath108 component is still increasing with energy ( positive intercept ) and their @xmath20 behaviour mimic an higher - twist behaviour , i.e. they decrease like a negative power of @xmath19 both features allowed the authors of @xcite to look for the possibility that the @xmath109 component could be interpreted as the high @xmath20 remnant of the `` soft '' pomeron considered as an higher - twist contribution from the point of view of the operator product expansion of qcd .",
    "this would provide a qcd framework for the two - pomeron hypothesis proposed in @xcite to describe the phenomenological features of structure functions in a different , regge approach .",
    "let us now investigate how the phenomenological discussion can be influenced by the determination of the conformal couplings derived in the previous sections . in order to analyze the phenomenology of structure functions in a manner similar to refs .",
    "@xcite , we have to introduce our determination ( [ phis ] ) of the perturbative coupling to the photon and discuss the proton coupling using , for instance , the family of parametrizations ( [ models ] ) . in the discussion , however , it is important to take into account the ambiguity of the separation between perturbative and non - perturbative couplings discussed in @xcite for the @xmath18 component .",
    "let us recall the problem and extend its lessons to the @xmath2 component .",
    "we will consider the following parametrization configurations of the photon ( with its typical singularity in @xmath110 ) to be present ( model i ) or absorbed ( model ii ) in the non - perturbative coupling to the proton .",
    "we checked that the results we obtained in the framework of model i are very similar for model ii up to a renormalization of the @xmath82 component .",
    "] of the functions @xmath111 to be inserted in ( [ eq02 ] ) : @xmath112 @xmath113 where the non perturbative coupling has been chosen in order to satisfy the analyticity and convergence constraints in a minimal way .",
    "assuming the same analytic form for the non - perturbative @xmath82 proton coupling than @xmath114 the arbitrary normalization @xmath115 quantify the relative weight which we want to evaluate .",
    "the value @xmath116 has been choosen for convenience .",
    "@xmath117 at least is needed to verify the constraints ii ) .",
    "we checked that the results are rather independent of these choices , provided the constraints are satisfied .",
    "note that @xmath118 is `` softer '' at @xmath119 than @xmath120 due to the relative factor @xmath121    on a physical point of view , the non - perturbative vertices in formulae ( [ i],[i ] ) can be interpreted @xcite as related to the wave functions of the _ primordial dipole _",
    "configurations in the proton . in the qcd dipole model",
    "@xcite the bfkl dynamics can be expressed in terms of the dipole - dipole cross - section . translating this model in the case of @xmath4-proton scattering ,",
    "it amounts to consider this cross - section averaged both over the @xmath3 configurations of the photon and the _ primordial dipole",
    "_ configurations of the proton .    in order to check ]",
    "the sliding mechanism advocated in @xcite , we display in fig.2 the normalization independent plot @xmath122 as a function of @xmath123 for large @xmath6 and different values of @xmath124 on the same plot and for the same values is also shown the corresponding results for the regge parametrization of @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the results ( the black circles in fig.1 ) gives the location in a two - dimensional representation where the effective intercept is plotted as a function of the effective saddle - point @xmath125 they can be shown @xcite to be situated near the curves defined by the functions @xmath126 independantly of the peculiar form of the factors @xmath127 the sizeable sliding of the @xmath2 component is proven by the shift of the corresponding points with respect to the ultra - asymptotic value at @xmath128 moreover the evolution at large @xmath129 meets the phenomenological determination of the two pomeron components of @xcite for @xmath130 and reasonable values of the parameter @xmath131    in order to determine the relative strength of the @xmath82 and @xmath18 components , and thus the rle of the conformal prefactors @xmath132 ( see formulae ( [ i ] , [ i ] ) ) we have considered the 2-pomeron fit ( `` hard '' and `` soft '' ) of @xcite in the large @xmath20 region where it meets would be more precise but then , the non - perturbative corrections are expected to be important and may invalidate a correct evaluation of the normalization in a bfkl framework . ]",
    "the behaviour of the two ( @xmath18 and @xmath82 ) conformal spin components .",
    "for instance we show in fig.3 the @xmath6 dependence at fixed large @xmath19    the results indicate large normalizations , namely @xmath133 some other tests show that the normalization is always large of the same order .",
    "thus , the 2-pomeron conjecture ( as seen from a qcd point of view ) is obtained only if a strong dynamical enhancement favours the non - perturbative coupling of the @xmath82 component . since the perturbative coupling is maximal for linearly polarized transverse photon and limited in size because of positivity constraints ( the photon has only @xmath134 configurations ) the relevance of the @xmath82 coupling relies on the existence of a non - perturbative mechanism enhancing considerably the matching between the proton primordial dipole configurations and the azimuthal polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "we shall now speculate on such a non - perturbative mechanism based on azimuthal matching in @xmath4-proton scattering .",
    "the mechanism is the following ( see fig.4 , for a schematic representation ) .",
    "it is known from a long time @xcite that deep - inelastic lepton proton scattering is not necessarily dominated by a `` hard '' process if the energy is large with respect to the photon virtuality , e.g. if @xmath135 is small .",
    "indeed the _ effective _ virtuality is @xmath136 where @xmath81 ( resp .",
    "@xmath137 ) is the momentum fraction of the quark ( resp .",
    "antiquark ) in the virtual @xmath3 state configurations of the virtual photon .",
    "this is explicit , for instance , in the wave - functions ( [ waves ] ) .",
    "thus , if the favoured @xmath3 configurations are particularly assymetric ( aligned jet@xcite configurations ) one even may reach the situation where the quark or the antiquark in the pair have so small momentum that @xmath138 is of order unity and the reaction dominated by a `` soft '' process .    however , the experimental results seem not to favour the aligned jet mechanism since a `` hard '' component shows up which is precisely the one which could be described by the @xmath18 component . yet , for the @xmath82 component , it is not excluded however that a partial jet alignement can take place , at least at moderate @xmath19 at high @xmath20 one could then expect that assymetric configurations are substantially favoured in a kind of `` hard / soft '' compromise : the effective virtualities @xmath138 are smaller than @xmath139 while remaining in the `` semi - hard '' regime . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects a substantial _ azimuthal matching _ between the @xmath3 configurations of the virtual photon and the @xmath3 ( or primary dipole @xcite ) configurations in the proton , see fig.3 .",
    "this _ azimuthal matching _ may give a strong dynamical enhancement for the coupling of the linearly polarized components of the photon to the proton .",
    "by this azimuthal enhancement one could find the qualitative justification for the two - pomeron description to be based on the two conformal spin components .",
    "on the other hand , in the absence of such a mechanism the @xmath82 components , even if increasing with energy due to the sliding phenomenon , would not be coupled enough to the proton to give rise to a sizable component .",
    "we shall in conclusion discuss possible tests of azimuthal alignment which is certainly deserving further study .",
    "let us briefly summarize our results :    \\i ) taking into account that the non - zero ( indeed the @xmath2 ) conformal spin components of the bfkl qcd pomeron could be phenomenologically relevant in deep - inelastic lepton proton scattering , we have given the formal expression of the proton structure functions conformal spin components in terms of the appropriate _",
    "impact factors_.",
    "\\ii ) we have computed the perturbative _ impact factor _ for the @xmath2 component at the virtual photon vertex using a general relation between impact factors and @xmath3 wave functions .",
    "the key result is that the coupling is maximal for linear azimuthal polarization and zero for circular ( or no ) polarization .",
    "\\iii ) in order to be phenomenologically relevant as a `` second '' pomeron contribution in @xmath4-proton scattering , a strong _ azimuthal matching _ with the primordial dipole @xmath3 configurations of the proton is required .",
    "this non - perturbative mechanism could be associated in part with jet alignment _ a la bjorken _ for the @xmath2 component , while it is expected to be weak or absent for the @xmath18 one .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "the large enhancement ( a factor @xmath140 ) of the non - perturbative coupling to the @xmath82 component that we found necessary to match with the two - pomeron parametrization of ref.@xcite is consistent with the key point of this kind of phenomenological analysis : the mismatch between the `` hard '' and `` soft '' pomerons is more important than in models with only one effective pomeron singularity . in particular , at intermediate values of the virtuality @xmath141 both contributions are important .",
    "this is the reason why the `` hard '' component has a large intercept @xmath142 in agreement with the theoretical range of values and larger than the effective intercept @xmath143 see for instance @xcite .",
    "the validity of a non - negligeable `` soft '' pomeron coupling at high @xmath20 is thus to be checked in further study .",
    "a specific feature of the @xmath82 component is its special azimuthal properties .",
    "the question arises whether it is possible to isolate it using azimuthal correlation properties . for the total inclusive process , leading to the determination of the structure function itself , this seems uneasy .",
    "the relevant azimuthal axis in the photon - dipole center - of - mass frame , see fig.4 , can be very different from the photon - proton one , and thus , in particular , the s - channel helicity conservation which seems to be an approximate property of the `` soft '' pomeron coupling is not in contradiction with the conformal spin properties of the @xmath82 component .",
    "a possible test of the _ azimuthal matching _ could be performed in forward jet production in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "indeed , while the commonly considered configuration with similar scales for the photon probe and the jet is expected to lead to small azimuthal correlation at high rapidity interval @xcite , the case with a larger scale ratio is expected to lead to stronger azimuthal correlation due to the enhancement with energy of the higher conformal spin component responsible for the azimuthal matching in the considered formalism . indeed , a practical way of checking the azimuthal correlations could be to fix a certain range of high is limited by the necessity of a large rapidity interval with the forward jet . ]",
    "@xmath20 for the photon virtuality and vary the tranverse momentum of the forward jet down to the lower admissible value to select a jet . by this way ,",
    "one increases the ratio @xmath144 of scales and thus enhance the energy behaviour of the @xmath82 component .",
    "moreover , since the model implies a strong mismatch between the `` soft '' and `` hard '' pomerons at intermediate scale , one expects the development of a stronger ( and perhaps different in sign ! ) azimuthal correlation than the perturbatively predicted azimuthal correlations ( with negative sign ) studied in ref .",
    "a similar method can be proposed at tevatron analyzing azimuthal correlations between two jets ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in different hemispheres , as analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the prediction that it will increase together with the ratio @xmath145      we are grateful to stephane munier and henri navelet for stimulating discussions and suggestions .",
