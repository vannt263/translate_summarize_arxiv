    "properties of dilute and degenerate fermi gases with large scattering lengths are of particular interest in the context of cold fermionic atoms and dilute neutron matter . in the case of trapped fermionic atoms , due to very low density , the scattering length is the only parameter which determines an atom - atom interaction . taking advantage of feshbach resonances",
    "it can be tuned , using external magnetic field , to the values which greatly exceed the average interparticle distance .",
    "this limit which is dubbed the unitary regime exhibits universal properties and has been the subject of intensive theoretical effort in the last couple of years ( see @xcite and references therein ) . similarly ,",
    "neutron matter at densities corresponding to @xmath0 @xmath1 is a dilute system of fermions in a sense that the average distance between particles is much larger than the range of the neutron - neutron interaction .",
    "it is superfluid and its physics is determined by two parameters : scattering length @xmath2 and effective range @xmath3 in @xmath4 neutron - neutron channel .",
    "the influence of other channels as well as of three - body forces is marginal and can be neglected in this density range@xcite .",
    "the properties of dilute neutron matter are crucial for understanding the structure and thermal evolution of neutron star crust@xcite",
    ". they can also provide constraints for parameters of nuclear energy density functional .    despite of these similarities",
    "the important qualitative difference between dilute neutron matter and cold atomic gases arises from the fact that in the former case the nonzero effective range can not be neglected .",
    "therefore contrary to cold atomic gases , physics of dilute neutron matter can not be captured by simple contact , delta - like interaction ( except for very low densities @xmath5@xmath1 ) .    since fermi gas with long scattering length is an example of strongly correlated system , non - perturbative methods based on monte carlo approaches are often used to determine its properties . there",
    "exist various calculations at zero temperature @xcite . here",
    "we present selected aspects of afqmc approach at finite temperatures , which is able to generate fully non - perturbative results for dilute neutron matter without sign problem .",
    "neutron - neutron interaction in dilute neutron matter can be described by small number of parameters characterizing the low energy physics of two - body collisions . in this limit the main contribution to the scattering amplitude comes from s - wave scattering and is determined by two parameters : scattering length @xmath2 and effective range @xmath3 i.e. : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    to capture low energy physics of dilute neutron matter we consider the hamiltonian of the form : @xmath9 where the field operators obey the fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the spin degree of freedom . throughout this work",
    "we shall use units in which planck s and boltzmann s constants are equal to one .",
    "the interaction has the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 . +",
    "this choice has been motivated , as will become clear later , by the special form of discrete hubbard - stratonovich ( h - s ) transformation .",
    "it imposes limitations on the density range of neutron matter which can be described by this particular interaction .",
    "clearly the interaction depends on two parameters : @xmath14 and @xmath15 . solving the equation for @xmath16-matrix elements : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the free particle propagator and using the relation : @xmath19",
    "we can adjust parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 to reproduce scattering length @xmath2 and effective range @xmath3 of the neutron - neutron interaction .",
    "still however the regularization procedure is required , which can be determined by introducing the momentum cut - off @xmath20 .",
    "this prescription sets to zero all two - body matrix elements , if the relative momentum of two particles exceeds a given momentum cut - off .    in order to compute thermal properties of dilute neutron matter we place the system on a 3d spatial lattice .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath15 and size @xmath21 introduce natural ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) momentum cut - offs given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the momentum space has the shape of a cubic lattice , with size @xmath24 and spacing @xmath25 . to simplify the analysis , however , we place a spherically symmetric uv cut - off , including only momenta satisfying @xmath26 .    to evaluate expectation values of observables we have used a path integral representation of partition function : @xmath27 \\right \\},\\\\",
    "o(\\beta,\\mu ) & = &   \\dfrac{1}{z(\\beta,\\mu)}{\\mathrm{tr } } \\ ; \\left \\ { \\hat{o}\\prod_{k=1}^{n_\\tau } \\exp [ -\\tau ( \\hat{h}-\\mu \\hat{n } ) ] \\right \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath16 is the temperature and @xmath29 - the chemical potential , @xmath30 - the particle number operator and @xmath31 is a quantity of interest .",
    "the propagator @xmath32 is decomposed using the second order expansion@xcite : @xmath33 \\approx \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{\\tau ( \\hat{t}-\\mu \\hat{n})}{2}\\right ] \\exp(-\\tau \\hat{v } ) \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{\\tau ( \\hat{t}-\\mu \\hat{n})}{2}\\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the kinetic energy operator . to express the many body operator @xmath35 by a sum of one body operators we have extended the discrete h - s transformation introduced by hirsch@xcite .",
    "namely , one may rewrite the interaction in the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "note that in the coordinate representation each element of the above sum can take the following values : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes eigenvalue of density operator .",
    "this allows us to introduce the h - s transformation of the form : @xmath40}\\ ] ] where values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 have to fulfil the equations : @xmath43 this set of equations has a solution if @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( attraction ) .",
    "the partition function can be expressed in the form : @xmath46\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 defines the time - ordered product and @xmath48 denotes the one - body hamiltonian .",
    "consequently the expectation value of an arbitrary operator takes the form@xcite : @xmath49 the many - fermion problem has thus been reduced to the typical afqmc problem . consequently the standard metropolis algorithm can be applied , using @xmath50 as a measure@xcite .    to prove that the measure is positive",
    "it is sufficient to note that the operator @xmath51 is invariant with respect to time reversal .",
    "this is due to the special form of expression ( [ eq : hs - transformation ] ) and the fact that the sigma field is real .",
    "therefore the single particle spectrum of @xmath51 consists of pairs which are conjugate to each other . clearly @xmath52 . in particular",
    "if the single particle basis is chosen in such a way that the time reversed partners correspond to spin - up and spin - down particles then the matrix representation of @xmath53 takes the form : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "matrix elements between states with different spin projections are equal to zero .",
    "finally one gets @xmath56=\\det [ 1 + { \\cal{u}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}}]\\det [ 1 + { \\cal{u}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}^{*}}]=|\\det [ 1 + { \\cal{u}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}}]|^{2}\\geqslant 0.\\ ] ] hence the lack of the sign problem is a direct consequence of the time - reversal symmetry which is preserved by each term in the sum ( [ eq : hs - transformation ] ) .",
    "in order to verify the correctness of our code we have performed several tests . as a first check the thermodynamics of a free gas was reproduced for @xmath57 .    to check our results for an interacting system we have diagonalized the hamiltonian ( 2 ) exactly , restricting the single - particle hilbert space to the lowest 7 states .",
    "it corresponds to the fock space of @xmath58 states .",
    "the test provided an estimate for the size of the imaginary time step .",
    "comparison of afqmc results with the exact ones for selected observables at fixed temperature is given in the table [ tab : comparion ] .    to perform calculations for a neutron matter we have used the box with @xmath59 and lattice constant @xmath60fm .",
    "the neutron mass was fixed at @xmath61 mev .",
    "the chemical potential was chosen in such a way to keep the total number of particles equal to 55 .",
    "this corresponds to the density of neutron matter @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the saturation density of nuclear matter . for this density",
    "we have varied temperatures from @xmath64 ( @xmath65 mev ) to @xmath66 ( @xmath67 mev ) where @xmath68 is the fermi energy .",
    "for the lowest temperature we have used @xmath69 imaginary time steps while for the highest temperature only @xmath70 . in all runs the single - particle occupation probabilities for the highest energy states were below @xmath71 at all temperatures . at low temperatures",
    "the singular value decomposition technique was used to avoid instabilities of the algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig : eos ] presents an example of the results for the energy and chemical potential as a function of temperature .",
    "the energy and chemical potential versus temperature for the free fermi gas at the same particle density has also been plotted ( dotted line ) .",
    "the free fermi gas results were shifted by constant values @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the energy and the chemical potential , respectively .",
    "for our lowest temperature @xmath64 ( @xmath65 mev ) we obtained the energy ( relative to the energy of the free fermi gas @xmath74 ) @xmath75 ( @xmath76 mev ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with recent fixed - node quantum monte carlo calculations@xcite .",
    "the chemical potential at this temperature was calculated to be @xmath77 ( @xmath78 mev ) .",
    "in this work we have introduced the simple effective interaction which is capable to describe properties of dilute neutron matter . for this interaction",
    "we have constructed hubbard - stratonovich transformation which yield to positive measure and allows to perform monte carlo calculations without fermionic sign problem .",
    "we have performed the fully non - perturbative calculations for dilute neutron matter of density @xmath62 at finite temperatures .",
