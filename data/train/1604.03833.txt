    "for an elasticity tensor obtained from empirical information , the resulting symmetry class is explicitly the property of a hookean solid represented by that tensor , where this solid is a mathematical analogy of the physical material in question .",
    "the inference of properties of that material requires further interpretation . among these properties there are symmetries of such a material , hence",
    ", it is useful to examine symmetries of its models . in particular",
    ", it is useful to compute an isotropic counterpart of the obtained tensor .",
    "the decision then lies in choosing an appropriate norm to compute the counterpart , hence the crux of this paper .",
    "we compare isotropic counterparts according to the frobenius-36 norm , frobenius-21 norm , which we refer to as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , as well as according to the operator norm and the @xmath0 slowness - curve fit , which we refer to as @xmath3 and @xmath0 , respectively .",

    "to examine the closeness between elasticity tensors , as discussed by bos and slawinski ( 2013 ) and by danek et al .",
    "( 2013 , 2015 ) , we consider possible norms of tensor  ( [ eq : elas ] ) .",
    "the frobenius norm treats a matrix in @xmath14 as a euclidean vector in @xmath15 . in the case of a symmetric @xmath16 matrix ,",
    "where @xmath17 , we can choose either @xmath18 which uses the thirty - six components , including their coefficients of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , or @xmath21 which uses only the twenty - one independent components , including their coefficients of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the operator norm of a symmetric @xmath16 matrix is @xmath22 where @xmath23 , is an eigenvalue of @xmath10 . as discussed by bos and slawinski  ( 2013 ) , such a norm of @xmath4 results from equation  ( [ eq : hooke ] ) if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are _ a  priori _ endowed with a frobenius norm .",
    "if @xmath4 is _ a  priori _ endowed with a frobenius norm , its origin in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 norm does not exhibit any standard form .",
    "in a manner similar to the @xmath1  norm , @xmath2  norm and operator norm , the slowness - curve @xmath0 fit is used to find an isotropic counterpart of an anisotropic hookean solid . however , in contrast to these norms , which rely on finding the smallest distance between tensors , it relies on finding the best fit of circles  according to a chosen criterion  to noncircular wavefronts .    in this approach , in a manner similar to the operator norm , we do not invoke explicit expressions for the components of the closest elasticity tensor but we examine the effect of these components on certain quantities .",
    "for the operator norm , this quantity consists of eigenvalues ; for the slowness - curve fit , this quantity consists of wavefront slownesses .",
    "the direct results of the norms are the components of the corresponding isotropic tensors , and the wavefront - slowness circles are their consequences .",
    "the direct result of the slowness - curve fit are slowness circles , and the components of the corresponding isotropic tensor are their consequence .",
    "the best fit , in the @xmath0 sense , is the radius ,  @xmath24 , that minimizes @xmath25 where @xmath26 are @xmath27 discretized values along the slowness curve , and @xmath28 is measured in the radial direction .",
    "hence , @xmath24  is the radius of the slowness circle ; it corresponds to isotropy .",
    "in this section , we investigate isotropic counterparts for the three norms introduced in section  [ norms ] . for that purpose , we use a transversely isotropic tensor derived from a generally anisotropic tensor obtained by dewangan and grechka ( 2003 ) , @xmath29\\,.\\ ] ] its components are density - scaled elasticity parameters .",

    "let us consider the frobenius norm using the thirty - six components .",
    "there are analytical formul to calculate  from a generally anisotropic tensor  the two parameters of its closest isotropic tensor ( voigt ,  1910 ) . from a transversely isotropic tensor ,",
    "these parameters are @xmath32 and @xmath33 hence , the closest isotropic counterpart of tensor  ( [ eq : ca ] ) is @xmath34\\,.\\ ] ]      let us consider the frobenius norm using the twenty - one independent components .",

    "thus , in spite of similarities between the isotropic tensors , the distance between them is large in comparison to their distances to tensor  ( [ eq : ca ] ) .",
    "this is an illustration of abstractness of the concept of distances in the space of elasticity tensors .",
    "a concrete evaluation is provided by comparing the results obtained by minimizing these distances .",
    "such results are tensors  ( [ eq : caiso36 ] ) , ( [ eq : caiso21 ] ) , ( [ eq : caisol2 ] ) , and their wavefront - slowness circles in figure  [ fig : ca ] .",

    "given two anisotropic tensors , we might be interested to know which of them is closer to isotropy .",
