    "now , as here we want the tree to be moreover @xmath100-free , we must construct the nodes of @xmath188 in such a way that an analogous statement holds for _ a sequence of nodes _ from @xmath188 , rather than just a single node .",
    "this requires the construction of branches through @xmath193 to be aware of all other branches that are expected to be constructed and put inside @xmath188 , including those that are there to insure the extensibility of the ascent path .",

    "moreover , the breakdown is such that each new theorem builds on ideas already established in the previous theorems in this sequence , and adds one or more new ideas in order to obtain a stronger result . therefore , when proceeding through any proof in these sections , the reader is expected to accept the techniques used in the preceding proofs .",
