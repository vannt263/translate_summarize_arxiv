    "the analytic expression of the magnification is given in terms of the expansion with respect to the source size .",
    "this expression is useful to understand how the finite source size effect works on the spectral feature of the magnification in the wave optics .",

    "the femtolensing might imprint the lensing signature on energy spectra if occurred , however , the finite source size effect is crucial .",
    "if the source size is larger than @xmath200 km , the finite source size effect becomes significant and will not allow the detection of the interference signature in the energy spectra .",
    "it is worthy noting the finite source size effect near the caustic . in the wave optics of the lens configuration of the einstein ring ,",
    "the maximum magnification of the point source is not divergent , but is in proportion to the frequency of the wave .",
