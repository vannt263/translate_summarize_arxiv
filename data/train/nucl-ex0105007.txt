    "in 1936 casimir argued that non - spherical nuclear shapes were necessary to explain the hyperfine structure seen in atomic and molecular spectra @xcite .",

    "few scientists have contributed as much to the amazing developments and excitement in our field as szymaski .",
    "i well remember the first time i heard him speak .",
    "it was at one of the famous may high spin gatherings at the niels bohr institute in ris in the early 1980 s .",
    "the discussion had become somewhat bogged down on something rather trivial .",
    "it was then that szymaski rose to his feet from the back of the audience , ( in a similar manner to how his mind had just `` risen above the tree - line in order to see the forest '' ) and speaking softly in his wonderful way , he was able to steer the conversation out of the  trees \" and towards something much more important .",
    "so often we  regular mortals \" get carried away with the little details and fail to comprehend the grand scheme or how it all fits together .",
    "szymaski clearly possessed a rare ability to see the  big picture \" .",
    "amazingly , he has been able to pass this leadership gift onto his `` scientific children '' .",
    "his achievements , and those of the warsaw group which he created and cultivated , are legendary . he was a true `` titan '' of our field ! _    the basic microscopic mechanism leading to the existence of deformed configurations , _ spontaneous symmetry - breaking _",
    ", was first proposed by jahn and teller for molecules @xcite .",
    "the basic element of the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect is the vibronic coupling ( the jt matrix element ) between the collective excitations of the system and the single - particle motion . the jt effect was brought to nuclear structure by a. bohr in his paper on  the coupling of nuclear surface oscillations to the motion of individual nucleons\"@xcite . in bohr",
    "s picture , the vibronic coupling was represented by the interaction between the single - particle motion of valence nucleons and the collective excitations ( multipole vibrations ) of the core , known as the particle - vibration ( pv ) coupling .",
    "this coupling is a central element in the analysis of nuclear collective modes and nuclear deformations @xcite .",
    "depending on the geometrical properties of the individual valence nucleon ( i.e. , anisotropy of its wave function ) , the pv coupling can result in core polarization that can change the original deformation of the core .",
    "if residual interactions are present , they effectively reduce the magnitude of the jt coupling . in particular , pairing correlations in atomic nuclei give rise to a large residual energy ( energy gap ) which weakens deformation effects . as a result ,",
    "nuclear ground - state configurations experience weak jt ( or pseudo - jt ) effect ; the extreme jt effect can take place in excited nuclear states such as high spin states .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more discussion of the nuclear jt effect . )",
    "a stunning observation in studies of rapidly rotating atomic nuclei is that due to the strong coriolis force residual two - body correlations ( e.g. , pairing ) are significantly quenched at high angular momenta .",
    "indeed , the excellent reproduction of experimental high spin data ( moments of inertia , alignments , routhians ) by calculations without pairing ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references quoted therein ) suggests that , in the high - frequency regime , the configuration mixing due to pairing is weak .",
    "another factor that further contributes to the diminished role of residual correlations is the reduced single - particle level density at the fermi surface due to the presence of strong shell effects at deformed shapes .",
    "the resulting deformed potentials give rise to magic numbers that appear just as strikingly , but at quite different @xmath1 and @xmath2 values , as for a spherical nucleus .",
    "consequently , highly deformed and superdeformed bands are probably the clearest examples of a pure single - particle motion in a deformed potential @xcite and wonderful laboratories of the nuclear jt effect and shape polarization .    in the @xmath3@xmath0135 ( @xmath2=58 - 62 ) light rare - earth region , a variety of rotational sequences with characteristics consistent with highly - deformed prolate shapes with quadrupole deformation of @xmath4@xmath00.30 - 0.40 , compared with @xmath4@xmath00.20 for normal ground state deformations ,",
    "have been observed @xcite .",
    "these studies have revealed that the existence of highly - deformed bands is the result of an interplay between microscopic shell effects , such as the occurrence of large shell gaps near @xmath2=58 and @xmath1=72 in the nucleon single - particle energies , and the occupation of high-@xmath5 low-@xmath6 intruder orbitals .",
    "initially , it was thought that the involvement of one or more @xmath7 neutrons was necessary for the strong polarization of the nuclear shape to stabilize large deformation in this mass region @xcite .",
    "however , recently it was shown that bands involving the partial de - occupation of the extruder @xmath8[404]9/2 proton orbital in the odd-@xmath2 praseodymium ( see @xcite and references therein ) and promethium @xcite isotopes also exhibit comparable quadrupole deformations@xcite . furthermore , for nuclei below @xmath1=73 where the occupancy of the @xmath7 neutron is energetically unfavored , there are indications that bands involving the @xmath9 [ 541]1/2 neutron orbital may also push the nucleus to `` enhanced '' deformation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "( for representative single - particle diagrams , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in an attempt to further understand the deformation properties of a variety of different single - particle orbitals throughout the @xmath3@xmath0135 mass region , a comprehensive lifetime experiment with measurements on over 15 different nuclei was performed .",
    "while such an idea has been exploited for several cases in the @xmath3=80 @xcite and 135 @xcite highly - deformed , and the @xmath3=150 @xcite and 190 @xcite superdeformed regions , it has never been done before in such a global manner .    from the measured lifetimes , one can extract `` differential '' transition quadrupole moments @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the configuration of the band in the nucleus @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the transition quadrupole moment of the assumed core nucleus . according to the  additivity principle \" proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the quadrupole moment @xmath14 can be expressed as a sum of individual contributions carried by individual particle and hole states which appear near the fermi level .",
    "namely , the relative transition quadrupole moment can be very well approximated by the  extreme shell model \" expression @xmath15 where @xmath16 runs over the particles and holes with respect to the core configuration in the nucleus @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 represents the effective single - particle transition quadrupole moment , i.e. , the change of the total intrinsic moment which is induced on the whole nucleus by the given particle or hole . by measuring or calculating values of @xmath18 for a number of nuclei and configurations , one can extract values of @xmath17 hence the quadrupole polarizabilities associated with individual orbitals .",
    "the transition quadrupole moments for various highly - deformed structures in the @xmath3@xmath0135 region have been measured in separate past experiments using the doppler - shift attenuation method ( dsam ) , however conclusive comparisons between similar structures in different nuclei were limited because of systematic differences such as reaction choice and target retardation properties . specifically , the differences in the parameterization of the nuclear and electronic stopping powers , which act as an `` internal clock '' in dsam measurements , have contributed to large variations in the extracted @xmath19 values reported for exactly the same nucleus and band .",
    "the absence of adequate experimental information on the time structure of the quasi - continuum side feeding contribution also provided additional uncertainty . in the present study , these systematic uncertainties were greatly reduced because a variety of different nuclei were produced under similar conditions and then analyzed using the same techniques .",
    "furthermore , the high efficiency and resolving power of gammasphere coupled with microball made it possible to explore the time structure of the side - feeding into particular bands .",
    "in this study , high - spin states of a variety of @xmath3@xmath0135 nuclei ( @xmath2=58 - 62 ) were populated after fusion of a @xmath20cl beam with an isotopically enriched 1 mg/@xmath21 thick @xmath22pd foil mounted on a 17 mg/@xmath21 au backing . the 173 mev @xmath20cl beam",
    "was provided by the 88-inch cyclotron at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",

    "the centroid - shift doppler - shift attenuation method @xcite was used in several different ways . for the most intense bands ,",
    "spectra were generated by summing gates on the cleanest , fully stopped transitions at the bottom of the band of interest and projecting the events onto the `` forward '' ( 31.7@xmath27 and 37.4@xmath27 ) and `` backward '' ( 142.6@xmath27 and 148.3@xmath27 ) axes .",
    "these spectra were then used to extract the fraction of the full doppler shift , @xmath28 ) , for transitions within the band of interest , [ @xmath29 is the centroid of the @xmath23-ray energy distribution as measured in a detector at angle @xmath30 with respect to the beam direction , @xmath31 is the unshifted @xmath23-ray energy , and @xmath32 is the mid - target recoil velocity ] .",
    "in addition , for many bands double gates were set on in - band `` moving '' transitions in any ring of detectors and data were once again incremented into separate spectra for events detected at `` forward '' , `` 90@xmath27 '' , and `` backward '' angles . for the most intense bands , doppler - shifted coincidence gates could also be set on the highest spin transitions within the band , making it possible to eliminate the effect of side - feeding for states lower in the cascade .",
    "approximately a 10% increase in the deduced quadrupole moment was found for the @xmath7 neutron configurations when using the latter method compared to the value extracted by gating on the stopped transitions at the bottom of the same band , which is in agreement with recent @xmath33ce results @xcite . a sample of these results in presented in fig  [ ftau ] .",

    "although the uncertainties in the stopping powers and the modeling of the side - feeding may contribute an additional systematic error of 15@xmath3620@xmath37 in the absolute @xmath35 values , the relative values are considered to be accurate to a level of 5@xmath3610@xmath37 .",
