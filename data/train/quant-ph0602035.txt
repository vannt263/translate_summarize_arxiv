    "it is known , that an arbitrary quantum state can not be copied perfectly [ 1 ] .",
    "however v.buzek and m.hillery in work [ 2 ] offered a universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) , allowing to create 2 identical qubits from 1 qubit .",
    "two output qubits are a copy of each other , but they are not a copy of an initial quantum state , and are similar to it only in @xmath0 .",
    "universality of the uqcm is that it clones any quantum state with identical accuracy . in the present work some variants of not universal qcm",
    "are considered .",
    "their lack is that they clone qubits non - uniformly depending on their state . in a final section the calculation scheme of uqcm from the general principles",
    "is submitted which includes known results [ 3,4 ] as special cases .",
    "it is shown , how one can choose optimum by quantity of used quantum operations uqcm from given ones .",
    "any quantum state @xmath1 is represented by a point on bloch sphere and changes by means of rotation operator [ 5 ] : @xmath2 for simplicity we shall work with equatorial qubits , then @xmath3 and @xmath4 pauli matrices can be written down as projectors @xmath5 action of pauli matrixes on an input @xmath6 is given by expression    @xmath7    we shall note at once , that scalar product @xmath8 .",
    "it means , that for any @xmath9 with the help of the universal operator @xmath10 it is possible to create an orthogonal state @xmath11 . for corresponding ( [ 1.2 ] )",
    "matrixes of density we shell receive    @xmath12    similarity of two quantum states @xmath13 and @xmath14 is determined by overlapping of their wave functions [ 6 ] :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 .",
    "the basic two - qubit gate is operation of controlled - not ( cnot ) [ 5 ] :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the modulus-2 summation .",
    "the first qubit in this expression refers to as control .",
    "it does not vary at cnot transformation .",
    "the second qubit is a controllable or the target - qubit of cnot operator .",
    "if indexes of the operator to change places : @xmath19 , the second qubit becomes control , and the first becomes a target qubit .",
    "cnot operator allows to create the entangled state of two qubits .",
    "studying and use of the entangled states is one of the basic problems of quantum calculations .",
    "the ideal cloning of the qubit is forbidden . really , as wooters and zurek have shown [ 1 ] , if there is such a linear unitary operator , that @xmath20 than for orthogonal states @xmath21 we have @xmath22 on the other hand , owing to linearity @xmath23 : @xmath24 we came to various expressions that proves impossibility of existence of such operation .",
    "in the present work the les complicated task is considered : whether it is possible to receive , even nonideal copy of any quantum state , and what quantum operations are necessary for this purpose ?",
    "the elementary qcm can be constructed from a single cnot operator ( fig.1 ) . submitting on one input of the qcm an arbitrary quantum state @xmath9 , and on other - a qubit in state @xmath25",
    "we shall receive    @xmath26        the work of the qcm is reduced to action by cnot operator on input qubits @xmath27 and on an output we receive the entangled state ( ebit ) .",
    "the density matrix of the output ebit is given by expression @xmath28 .",
    "the reduced density operators of the output qubits look like    @xmath29    at the output of the qcm it is received two identical states .",
    "it is necessary to determine , how output states differ from the input qubit @xmath9 . comparing ( [ 2.1 ] ) and",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) it is easy to see , that the output density operator is expressed through the input density operator as follows : @xmath30 looking at this expression it is possible to make the assumption , that the target state on @xmath31 coincides with input state and has @xmath32 of an impurity .",
    "however more detailed consideration results in other conclusion .",
    "really , scalar product @xmath33 i.e. states are not orthogonal , and it means , that wave functions @xmath9 and @xmath34 are overlapped and part of the information concerning @xmath9 is contained in a density matrix @xmath35 .",
    "therefore for calculation of coppying accuracy we shall take advantage of the formula ( [ 1.4 ] )    @xmath36    from last expression it is visible , that accuracy of cloning depends on an input state of the original , so received qcm is not universal .",
    "it can not cloning any , beforehand unknown states with identical accuracy . averages ( [ 2.2 ] ) on bloch sphere we shall receive : @xmath37      now we shall rotate input @xmath25 qubit for increase of cloning fidelity ( fig.2 ) .",
    "rotation of the @xmath38 qubit on angle @xmath39 gives @xmath40        after that , the state @xmath41 comes to the input channel of the cnot . at the output of the qcm",
    "we ll receive @xmath42 with the reduced density matrixes @xmath43    @xmath44    and average fidelity @xmath45     on rotation angle @xmath39 for two - operator qcm ]    as well as in previous case , cloning fidelity depends on the initial state of the qubit - original .",
    "in addition , accuracy depends on a angle @xmath39 of the rotation @xmath25 qubit .",
    "here it is possible to specify some cases ( fig.3 ) :    \\1 . at @xmath46",
    "we shall receive two copies with identical average fidelity : @xmath47 .",
    "\\2 . at @xmath48 the accuracy dispersion of the first qubit is equal to zero : @xmath49 and",
    "the states are separable , i.e. @xmath50 3 . at @xmath51 measurement results of output states",
    "are absolutely anticorrelitive : @xmath52 4 . at @xmath53",
    "average fidelity of output states again coincides , but we have received `` no '' results : @xmath54 .",
    "more complex case of quantum cloning is carried out by buzek and hillery s universal qcm ( uqcm bh ) [ 2 ] . universality of this machine is that its cloning accuracy does not depend on a state of the qubit - original .",
    "we ll search for the reduced density matrixes of output as decomposition on projectors of orthogonal wave functions @xmath9 and @xmath55 :                          sometimes the criterion of universality of quantum cloning is determined by an opportunity of representation of the output state as @xmath72 where _ s _ is scaling factor .",
    "it is easy to show , that the latter expression is a direct consequence from orthogonal decomposition ( [ 3.1 ] ) : @xmath73 hence there follows connection between the dimensional factor _",
    "s _ and factors of decomposition @xmath71 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is obvious , that for the work of the uqcm it is necessary to have in addition to the qubit - original two more @xmath89-qubits .",
    "it is necessary to find such transformations of input system of qubits @xmath90 , which will result to @xmath91 ( [ 3.3 ] ) or ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "it is a stage of preparation uqcm for work . at the second stage",
    "entangling of input @xmath9 and prepared @xmath96 qubits by the cnot operators is made : @xmath97 .",
    "we shall examine more attentively each of the stages .                              which together with action of cnot operators allow to create state @xmath96 ( [ 3.14 ] ) , ( [ 3.15 ] ) from two @xmath98-qubits .",
    "we have prepared uqcm to work .",
    "actually , the cloning process is carried out at the second stage .",
    "let s choose such combination of cnot operators which will make an output state @xmath108 from input @xmath9 and prepared @xmath109 qubits .",
    "we ll consider more in detail the construction sequence of such operators on the example of uqcm pc . from state @xmath9 and ( [ 3.15 ] )                        we have received the table of the validity for boolean functions of three variables @xmath118 . according to the given table we shall write down set of disjunctive normal forms and present them as zhegalkin polynoms :      using the definition of cnot operator ( [ 1.5 ] ) from ( [ 3.23 ] ) we ll obtain @xmath120 let s sum up construction uqcm pc ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the first stage is described by the expression ( [ 3.16 ] ) . however , according to ( [ 3.18 ] ) @xmath121 , therefore ( [ 3.16 ] ) can be copied as @xmath122 where the rotation angle of the operator @xmath123 is determined in ( [ 3.18 ] ) . at the second stage",
    "two cnot operators entangle the qubit - original @xmath9 with prepared state @xmath96 : @xmath124 as result we shall receive an output three qubits density matrix @xmath125 from which with accuracy @xmath126 two identical bunches @xmath127 are reduced .",
    "the similar calculation algoritm at comparison of expressions ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.14 ] ) result in sequence of actions of the uqcm bh [ 7 ] : @xmath128 we shall note the basic differences of two considered uqcm",
    ". for uqcm bh the pure input state @xmath9 at the output is registered as a mix ( [ 3.1 ] ) . for uqcm pc the input state @xmath9 after cloning procedure has the view @xmath129 and has already 0.25 parts of the impurity .",
    "the further generalization of calculation algorithms of the uqcm is connected to the ability of cnot operator to interchange the position coefficients @xmath130 in decomposition ( [ 3.13 ] ) .",
    "then , in order to obtain an output state @xmath91 it is necessary to keep only a function @xmath96 ( [ 3.13 ] ) , and it becomes indifferent where is a factor @xmath130 . as an example we shall examine uqcm pc ( [ 3.15 ] ) .",
    "calculation result are given in table 2 .",
    "the first line of the second column determines the initial combination of coefficients ( [ 3.15 ] ) : @xmath131 . as @xmath132 , rearranging coefficients @xmath115 we shall receive 12 various combinations . for each combination on system ( [ 3.17 ] ) we shall find rotation angles @xmath133 , and on algorithm ( [ 3.21])-([3.23 ] ) - operators of transition p : @xmath97 . for simplification of record we shall enter the following approach : @xmath134 @xmath135 for the description of cnot operator with inversion the designation is accepted    @xmath136 from table 2 it is visible , that for each @xmath109 there are two ways to obtain @xmath91 .",
    "it is connected to symmetry of an output state with respect to rearrangement @xmath137 .",
    "if we assump that for some combinations @xmath138 there are some decisions @xmath139 it is quite possible to choose the most simple uqcm from the number of obtained uqcm ( fig.4 ) .    wootters w. k. , zurek w. h.// nature , 1982 , v.299 , p.802 .",
