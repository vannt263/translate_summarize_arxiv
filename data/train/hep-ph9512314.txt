    "over the last two decades , interest in the initial - conditions problem for field theoretical models has been kindled and sustained by the needs of such apparently diverse areas as cosmology @xcite and several branches of many - body physics , notably in connection with the analysis of transient phenomena in the collision of complex nuclear systems @xcite . in these contexts",
    "one typically tries to obtain and solve equations describing the kinetic behavior of a particular , `` relevant '' subsystem or of a restricted set of `` relevant '' observables of a more comprehensive autonomous system .",
    "such is the case e.g. of the scalar driving field in the inflationary scenario of the early universe and of one - body densities and certain correlation functions in heavy - ion collisions . in general ,",
    "the relevant properties can be retrieved from appropriately constructed reduced density operators in the schrdinger picture , which will evolve nonunitarily on the account of correlation effects involving different subsystems @xcite @xcite .",
    "the nonunitary effects will manifest themselves through the dynamical evolution of the eigenvalues of the reduced densities , so that particular subsystems will in general evolve in a nonisoentropic manner @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming complexity of such a picture is considerably reduced whenever one is able to find physical grounds to motivate a mean - field - like approximation which consists in assuming isoentropic evolution of a relevant subsystem under effective , time - dependent hamiltonian operators for each subsystem @xcite . in this case the dynamics of the subsystem density matrix can be formulated in terms of a liouville - von neuman equation governed by an effective hamiltonian and studied e.g. from the point of view of the functional field - theoretical schrdinger picture , as proposed by jackiw @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the resulting problem still involves in general nonlinear hamiltonians , and can not be solved without further approximation . in the field - theoretical context",
    ", this has been implemented through the use of a gaussian ansatz for the subsystem density functional in the framework of a time - dependent variational principle supplying the appropriate dynamical information , notably for bosonic fields @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this last approximation amounts to a second mean - field approximation , now at the microscopic level of the single - field , nonlinear , isoentropic effective dynamics .",
    "actually , the gaussian ansatz , having the form of a exponential of a quadratic form in the field operators , implies that many - point correlation functions can be factored in terms of two - point functions .",
    "this is well known in the context of the derivation of the hartree - fock approximation to the nonrelativistic many - body problem @xcite .",
    "this factorization has been used by chang @xcite to implement the gaussian approximation for the @xmath0 theory .",
    "the dynamics of the reduced two - point density becomes then itself isoentropic , since irreducible higher - order correlation effects are neglected .",
    "the focus of this work is a reevaluation of this second mean - field approximation , for fermionic fields , in terms of a time - dependent projection approach developed earlier for the nonrelativistic nuclear many - body dynamics by nemes and de toledo piza @xcite .",
    "this approach allows for the formulation of a mean - field expansion for the dynamics of the two - point correlation function from which one recovers the results of the gaussian mean - field approximations in lowest order , i.e. , this approach permit to include and to evaluate higher dynamical corrections effects to the simplest gaussian mean - field approximation .",
    "moreover , the expansion is energy - conserving ( for closed system ) to all orders @xcite .",
    "the resulting dynamical equations acquire the structure of kinetic equations which eliminate the isoentropic mean - field constraint describing the effective dynamics of a selected set of observables @xcite .",
    "this approach was recently applied for the solution of the self - interacting @xmath1 theory in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "lin and de toledo piza find that the gaussian mean - field approximation fails qualitatively and quantitatively in the description of certain field variables .",
    "these failures are partially corrected by the collisional terms .",
    "motivated by success obtained in description of time evolution of a off - equilibrium uniform boson ( scalar field ) system beyond gaussian mean - field approximation in quantum - field theoretical context , it becomes interesting to study the fermion case in this approach . as a first step towards this end we consider in this paper the implementation of the gaussian approximation to a self - interacting system of fermions",
    "this is done in a framework suitable for the subsequent inclusion of collisional ( correlation ) corrections along the lines developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the self - interacting bosonic field .",
    "we consider , for simplicity and definiteness , the case of an off - equilibrium , spatially uniform many - fermion system described by chiral gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting non - trivial , renormalizable model for which many results are available in the literature so that it offers suitable testing ground for the proposed approach .",
    "on the basis of the general dynamics of the fields , we derive equations of kinetic type for the set of one - body variables in lowest order , which correspond to the gaussian mean - field approximation .",
    "the detailed consideration of correlation corrections is deferred to future work .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we obtain the dynamical equations which describe the time evolution of a general uniform fermion system .",
    "these equations are the groundwork for the implementation of the time - dependent projection technique .",
    "this technique and the approximation scheme are described in sec.iii . in sec.iv",
    "we implement in the quantum - field theoretical context the projection technique and obtain in gaussian mean - field ( isoentropic ) approximation the equations which describe the effective dynamics of a off - equilibrium spatially uniform ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional self - interacting fermion system described by chiral gross - neveu model @xcite . in sec.v",
    "we use the static solution of these equations in order to renormalize the theory , leading to the well - known effective potential obtained by gross and neveu using the @xmath2 expansion . in this same section ,",
    "we show also that other static results which have been discussed in the literature such as dynamical mass generation due to chiral symmetry breaking and a phenomenon analogous to dimensional transmutation can be retrieved from this formulation in a mean - field approximation .",
    "finally we obtain and discuss numerical solutions for non - equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to a final discussion and conclusions .",
    "some points of a more technical nature are discussed in the appendices .",
    "in this section , we shall describe a formal treatment of the kinetics of a self - interacting quantum field .",
    "although the procedure is quite general , we will adopt the specific context of a spatially uniform fermion system .",

    "the idea of our approach is to focus on the time evolution of a set of simple observables .",
    "we argue that a large number of relevant physical observables are one - body operators .",
    "consequently , the time evolution of observables which involve field bilinear forms such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , .... is desirable .",
    "these are the observables which are kept under direct control when one works variationally using a gaussian functional ansatz , and will therefore be refered to as gaussian observables . in order to keep as close as possible to the formulation appropriate for the many - body problem , we work in fact with expressions which are bilinear in the creation and annihilation parts of the fields in momentum space with periodic boundary conditions in a spatial box of lenght @xmath5 , defined in terms of an expansion mass parameter @xmath6 .",
