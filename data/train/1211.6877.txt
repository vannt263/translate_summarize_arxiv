    "the purpose of this section is to derive a rather general but simple model describing a novel class of lasing devices , those are driven by superconducting leads biased at voltage @xmath18 , have the optical resonance frequency at half the josephson generation frequency , @xmath19 , and contain many quantum states capable of emitting light .",
    "the purpose of the general approach is to capture the essential properties of this class of devices , without involving specific microscopic details of the used model . in this section",
    "we start by briefly repeating the essentials of the model for the hjl at microscopic level and extend it to contain a large number of effective emitters , yet at the microscopic level .",
    "we formulate the generic features of the model which are not specific to the details of the microscopic description . finally , we present the general but simple model where all these generic features are incorporated .",
    "we formulate the model in terms of a fokker - planck equation for three variables .",
    "the hjl is described in ref .   as an optical resonator driven by a single quantum emitter .",
    "the emitter is a double quantum dot in a _",
    "p - n _ semiconductor nanowire , capable of containing up to two electrons and two heavy holes .",
    "the energy of the corresponding discrete quantum states is determined by orbital and coulomb energies and is represented by hamiltonian @xmath20 .",
    "owing to the superconducting proximity effect , a gap is induced at the quantum dots for both electrons and holes , represented by hamiltonian @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are the proximity induced pair potentials , with the phases @xmath23 retaining the values of the corresponding superconducting leads . owing to gauge invariance , only the superconducting phase difference , @xmath24 will have a physical significance .",
    "interaction of the double quantum dot with the resonator mode occurs according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the frequency detuning from resonance , with @xmath27 the resonance frequency of the optical resonator and @xmath18 the bias over the device .",
    "the operator @xmath28 , taken in rotating frame , represents the electron hole recombination required for the photon emission .",
    "it can be seen as the dipole moment operator that drives the resonator mode .",
    "coefficient @xmath29 is the coupling strength of the dipole moment to the resonator mode .",
    "it is given by the dipole strength owing to quantum fluctuations of the electric field in the resonator mode .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is assumed to be perturbative as to allow for a large photon number before nonlinearities become manifest , which will induce saturation of the dipole moment .",
    "the dynamics of the resonator mode can be treated in a semiclassical fashion , because a large number of photons will occupy the mode . in view of this , the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 will be replaced by their respective expectation values in the photon - dependent part of the full hamiltonian .",
    "a scaled quantity is defined , @xmath33 . within this approximation ,",
    "the expectation value of the dipole moment , @xmath34 , is found by taking the derivative of the spectrum @xmath35 to @xmath36 , with @xmath35 and eigenstates @xmath37 associated with the full hamiltonian , @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the value of the dipole moment , @xmath39 , depends on the particular eigenstate of the double quantum dot . on the one hand ,",
    "the dipole moment depends on the optical field , @xmath40 , but on the other hand , the evolution of @xmath40 is determined by the dipole moment .",
    "this leads to a set of self - consistent equations @xmath41 stationary lasing is found when @xmath42 for finite values of @xmath40 .",
    "this state must be stable against small perturbations .",
    "to get lasing , the rate at which photons are created in the resonator mode , @xmath43 $ ] , needs to exceed the cavity escape rate , @xmath3 . in common lasers , the imaginary part of the susceptibility , im@xmath44 $ ] , results from pumping to excited states .",
    "usually , to achieve lasing , the pumping must be sufficiently intense to invert the population .",
    "for the hjl , it is the superconductivity that creates the required complex susceptibility so that the population inversion is not necessary . in fact , the ability of the superconductors to absorb or supply cooper pairs undermines the notions of groundstate and excited state in the quantum dots . for instance , the induced pair potentials enable the possibility of transitions from lower to _ higher _ energy states , while _ emitting _ a photon , with the required energy provided by the bias .",
    "this feature allows for cycles of emission or absorption of photons , in order to ( de)populate the resonator mode .",
    "decoherence in the hjl with a single emitter is caused by spontaneous switchings between quantum dot eigenstates .",
    "owing to the finite cavity linewidth , emission of off - resonant photons occurs inducing these switchings they occur at a slow rate , @xmath45 , and therefore introduce extra dynamics in the hjl described by a master equation .",
    "this is in addition to the already present dynamics of eq .  .",
    "it was found in ref .   that even for an optimal choice of parameters , not every quantum dot eigenstate couples to the resonator mode strongly enough to support lasing .",
    "the ones that do support lasing will yield different stationary values @xmath46 . since only some states support lasing , the optical field may even extinguish after a switch , to turn on again after another one . hence , the switchings change @xmath46 , causing large intensity and phase fluctuations . most notably , for every lasing state @xmath46 there is another one at @xmath47 . when going from some lasing state to a nonlasing state and returning to the same lasing state again , the optical field can go to both @xmath48 with equal probability .",
    "hence the switchings are responsible for decoherence .",
    "the coherence time is determined by the switching rate , @xmath1 , and is similar to that of the common laser.@xcite      even though the hjl , as described above , has a rather specific design , the framework provided by eqs .",
    "- is quite general .",
    "it applies to a class of devices where a biased josephson junction contains a structure of which the eigenstates couple to both superconducting leads and which can emit light by electron hole recombination . the light is emitted into an optical resonator .",
    "when the structure in the josephson junction is large enough it can be divided into @xmath0 blocks .",
    "every block represents an effective quantum emitter , which is a quantum system with a number of discrete eigenstates that can emit light .",
    "every emitter must couple to both superconducting leads and must emit light into the resonator mode . in principle , the emitters interact with each other , but we may model them to be independent . as an example of such a structure , one might consider an ensemble of _",
    "p - n _ semiconductor nanowires with a double quantum dot , the nanowire that was used in the previous section , or one might consider a two - dimensional electron gas between the superconducting electrodes.@xcite    increasing the number of emitters in the josephson junction to enhance the lasing is a method reminiscent of a line of research where superconducting lasers are made based on stacked josephson junctions.@xcite there , the josephson junctions are connected in series so that cascade amplification of the radiation occurs .",
    "the setup of the hjl is different though , because the emitters can be regarded as josephson junctions connected in parallel rather than in series .",
    "the dipole moment corresponding to the structure in the josephson junction is determined by its energy , which is taken in a rotating frame of reference .",
    "when the structure contains @xmath49 emitters the total energy is given by the sum of the energies of the emitters .",
    "assuming that emitter @xmath50 is in a state with energy @xmath51 , the total energy is simply @xmath52 .",
    "this yields a value of the total dipole moment given by @xmath53 , which should be inserted in eq .   to look for solutions that support lasing , @xmath46 .",
    "every emitter is subjected to spontaneous switchings that change its eigenstate .",
    "therefore , at time scales longer than the switching times it is not the total energy ( dipole moment ) that is relevant but the average total energy ( dipole moment ) .",
    "the switching dynamics defines a master equation for each of the emitters , where the probability @xmath54 of emitter @xmath50 to be in state @xmath55 evolves as @xmath56p_m^i      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 the transition rate from state @xmath58 in emitter @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity in brackets @xmath59 $ ] defines a transition matrix , which necessarily has a null vector to ensure the conservation of probability .",
    "the null vector gives the stationary occupation probabilities , @xmath60 . with these",
    ", the average total energy is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the energy of state @xmath55 in emitter @xmath50 .",
    "because of the coupling to the resonator mode , the energy depends on @xmath40 and the total average dipole moment is @xmath63 .",
    "now this quantity determines the lasing solutions of eq .  .",
    "let us discuss a complication that might easily arise when considering this model or designing a device .",
    "in our approach we consider spontaneous switchings only to be a result of off - resonant photon emission . in the limit of a large number of emitters the associated transition rate matrix , eq .",
    ", turns out to be approximately symmetric , with @xmath64 .",
    "the transition rates @xmath57 are calculated using fermi s golden rule .",
    "they are , up to some constants , given by the product of a matrix element squared , @xmath65 , for a given emitter @xmath50 , and a lorentzian shaped density of states , @xmath66 $ ] , with @xmath67 the energy difference between the eigenstates @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we note that the photon number generically remains the same during a transition ; @xmath40 is constant .",
    "only after the transition may relaxation to the new stationary state occur . for a large number of emitters , however , a single switching",
    "is not enough to change the electrical field in the mode significantly .",
    "the stationary state @xmath46 remains almost the same after the transition and therefore also the eigenstates and energies remain approximately the same .",
    "consequently , the transition rates also remain the same . since the energies @xmath67 have a large mismatch with the resonance frequency ( the emitted photons are far off - resonant ) they do not depend significantly on detuning , @xmath70 , and we have @xmath71 , for fixed @xmath40 . the transition rate from state @xmath68 to @xmath69 is therefore equal to the transition rate of the reversed process . hence , because the transition rates remain approximately the same after a transition , the transition rate matrix is approximately symmetric .",
    "innocent as it may seem , this feature of the transition matrix poses a problem for our device , because as a result the average value of the dipole moment , @xmath72 , must be approximately zero . the null vector for a symmetric transition matrix must be a vector with all entries equal .",
    "therefore , in the stationary solution to the master equations , all the states in an effective emitter @xmath50 have the same probability @xmath73 to be occupied .",
    "the total average dipole moment is then given by @xmath74 .",
    "however , for the summation over @xmath55 we find @xmath75 = 0 ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where tr@xmath76 is the trace over the space of states of emitter @xmath50 .",
    "the equality to zero follows because tr@xmath77 $ ] is independent of @xmath36 .",
    "consequently @xmath78 .",
    "we note that this is generic for any kind of system governed by our hamiltonian and where the relevant states defining the dipoles , are equally populated .",
    "naively one would expect that a large number of emitters would result in a large number of photons in the resonator mode .",
    "we see that this is not so . on the contrary",
    ", the total dipole moment could be zero and no photons are present .",
    "we need to adjust the model used in ref .   to get a nonzero average dipole moment .",
    "this is done by making the transition rate matrix asymmetric .",
    "then the occupation probabilities for the states of an emitter will not be equal anymore , resulting in an imbalance in populations of states .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to favor , for instance , the state with higher energy over the state with lower energy , for higher occupation probability .",
    "the notion of higher or lower energy of states has become obscured by the superconducting pair potentials .",
    "hence , the created imbalance is not the same as a population inversion .",
    "importantly , recombination of electron - hole pairs will still be characterized by the phase lock , because they are still coherent with the superconductors . despite introducing incoherent transition rates ,",
    "the special characteristics of the device are thus maintained .",
    "an asymmetry in the transition rate matrix can come about in various ways .",
    "the simplest way is to take into account the photon emission into the environment , rather than to the resonant mode .",
    "if the rate of this incoherent process is comparable with the emission rate to the resonant mode , the average dipole moment is of the order of its maximum value per emitter . in a realistic system",
    "we expect relaxation transitions between the emitter states that do not involve photon emission .",
    "these relaxation channels will generally yield asymmetric transition rate matrices .",
    "one can also engineer transition rates to get a sufficiently asymmetric transition matrix .",
    "a straightforward approach is to change the rates that are already present by changing the electromagnetic environment .",
    "a switching to a state with higher ( lower ) energy is accompanied by emission of an off - resonant photon , with energy @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , where @xmath81 . by changing the density of states in favor of one of these two , the spontaneous emission rate for the corresponding process increases with respect to the other one , thus creating the desired imbalance in transition rates .",
    "this might be done by inserting the device in a low quality factor resonator with resonance frequency about either of the frequencies .",
    "the low quality factor will ensure the rapid escape of the photon , before it is reabsorbed again .",
    "alternatively , the electromagnetic environment can be changed by shining with a red or blue detuned laser on the device , favoring transitions to lower and higher energy eigenstates respectively , proportional to the laser intensity .",
    "this resembles the technique of resolved sideband cooling / heating.@xcite another possibility is to add new transition rates to the system by adding nonsuperconducting leads to the device and directly pump electrons and/or holes into the optically active region .",
    "this , however , leads to big challenges in the technical device design .",
    "we have discussed the general features of possible microscopic realizations of a hjl with a large number of emitters .",
    "let us construct a model that does not rely on microscopic details .",
    "the relevant quantity to deal with is the @xmath40-dependent part of the total energy of the device , which determines the dipole moment .",
    "we show that the energy has a generic dependence on the phase difference between the superconducting leads .",
    "generally , we note that both common lasers and superconductors are systems characterized by a spontaneously broken @xmath82-symmetry , a phase symmetry . as such",
    "they are characterized by an order parameter which has a magnitude and a phase .",
    "any actual realization of the order parameter bears no apparent connection to the original unbroken symmetry .",
    "however , as a remnant of the symmetry , every value of the phase is equally probable and corresponding to states with equal energy .",
    "states with different phases are degenerate so that the energy of the system is independent of the phase .",
    "our model combines both of these systems , lasers and superconductors , which leads to a phase lock between the optical phase and the superconducting phase difference . indeed , owing to the interaction between these two systems",
    "a phase dependence must enter the energy of the system so that not both of the spontaneously broken symmetries can be maintained .",
    "the emission of a single photon is caused by the recombination of an electron - hole pair , with the latter carrying the phase of their respective condensates .",
    "the phase of the terms in the relevant interaction hamiltonian , eq .",
    ", is therefore given by @xmath83 , with @xmath84 the optical phase and @xmath85 the superconducting phase difference .",
    "in fact , the full interaction depends on the cosine of this phase combination , leading to a similar dependence in the energy . as a consequence",
    "an energy minimum is found for a specific value of @xmath83 , which is a manifestation of the phase lock between optical phase and superconducting phase difference .",
    "a further inspection of the phase dependence of the energy shows that there must , in fact , be two equivalent values of the phases . changing @xmath86 leaves the system invariant since the superconducting phase difference has not changed , but the phase in the interaction has changed to @xmath87 , so we conclude that @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the original spontaneously broken @xmath82 symmetries of the hamiltonian have been reduced to a single one and a spontaneously broken symmetry under rotations of @xmath6 of the optical phase .",
    "the remaining @xmath82 symmetry comprises invariance under a simultaneous change in optical phase and superconducting phase difference such that the quantity @xmath83 is unchanged .",
    "we stress that this reasoning applies to any system that combines two order parameters with spontaneously broken @xmath82 symmetries , with an interaction as in eq .  .",
    "any such system manifests a phase lock .      to find lasing in the general model , we need to have an expression for the energy of the device",
    "this allows us to extract essential physics from the model .",
    "generally , the energy should depend on the value of light field in the resonator , @xmath89 , and the pair potentials , @xmath90 , in the superconductors : @xmath91 .",
    "we use parameter limits where the four variables are relatively small , enabling us to use a taylor expansion for the energy .",
    "this limit corresponds to a weak drive of the resonator mode . to define `` small '' we go back to the model where the dipole medium consists of many emitters .",
    "we can associate an energy scale , @xmath92 , to each of these emitters .",
    "the induced pair potentials should be small compared to this scale , @xmath93 . in a realistic device this can be engineered by making suitable ( tunnel ) barriers between the superconductors and emitters .",
    "for the second limit , it is reasonable to take the interaction between dipole and resonator mode in the weak coupling limit .",
    "hence the coupling constant @xmath29 of the interaction hamiltonian , eq .  [ eq : ham_photon ] , is much smaller than @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , this interaction perturbs the dipole energy by a value of the order of @xmath92 only when a large number of photons , @xmath94 , occupies the resonator mode .",
    "we want to make sure that the stationary value of photon number , @xmath95 , is always much smaller than @xmath96 , so that the use of an expansion of the energy in terms of @xmath97 is always justified .    when writing the taylor expansion of the energy , @xmath91 , only a limited number of terms are allowed because of the specific phase dependence that is required . as was discussed in the previous section , the energy should depend on the phase combination , @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the lowest order phase - dependent term in the energy must be proportional to @xmath99complex conjugate .",
    "this is a fourth - order term in the taylor expansion .",
    "all other terms of equal or lower order are proportional to powers of @xmath100 or @xmath101 . writing only the terms with immediate relevance ,",
    "the energy is , up to fourth - order in taylor expansion @xmath102 in this expression the phase of the induced pair potentials was absorbed into the optical phase , so it is redefined as @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , we absorbed the induced pair potentials in the prefactor @xmath104 , with @xmath105 a constant .",
    "the primes in @xmath106 and @xmath107 refer , respectively , to first and second derivatives at @xmath108 of the function @xmath109 , which is independent of the induced pair potentials .",
    "the lowest order term , @xmath110 , is a sum of @xmath111 and some other terms depending on @xmath101 but not on @xmath97 and @xmath112 .",
    "these terms will therefore not be relevant for the dipole moment .",
    "there are also terms proportional to @xmath113 , but these are small compared to @xmath106 , because they are of higher order in the taylor expansion , and can safely be neglected .",
    "it is necessary to keep the @xmath114 term in the expansion , since this nonlinear term stabilizes a possible lasing instability . without this term",
    "the light field would grow exponentially under unstable conditions .",
    "when calculating the dipole moment later , we will see that @xmath106 adds up to the detuning from resonance .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath106 can implicitly be changed by changing the detuning .",
    "in fact , to get lasing the detuning should be such that @xmath106 effectively becomes small , of the order of @xmath115 or smaller , or goes to zero . because the detuning @xmath116 , this also sets the scale @xmath117 .",
    "we stress that this is an _ effective _ change of @xmath106 . in the expansion of eq .   the @xmath106 term is still considered to be larger than the fourth - order terms . with effectively @xmath118 ,",
    "the @xmath100 term is of the same order as , or smaller than , the @xmath114 term so the latter should be maintained in the expression for the energy . with the above expression for the energy we have managed to separate the dependence of the energy on @xmath97 and @xmath22 from the microscopic details of the driving medium .",
    "the latter are all contained in the prefactors of the taylor expansion .",
    "substituting eq .   into eq .  , we find an explicit , general self - consistency equation .",
    "noting that @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the redefined detuning .",
    "this equation describes the deterministic evolution of the electric field , @xmath97 , in the resonator mode .",
    "we note that an equivalent complex conjugate equation exists .",
    "the energy was considered to be a fixed quantity in the above section , corresponding to the average value of the dipole moment . to fully account for all dynamics in the hjl with many emitters",
    ", we also have to consider noise .",
    "this can be incorporated in a single fokker - planck equation that encompasses two noise sources .",
    "the first noise source is the traditional quantum noise due to photon emission from the mode.@xcite the second noise source describes the fluctuations of parameters in eq .  .",
    "to understand the latter let us note that eq",
    ".   is valid not only in average , but also for each specific configuration of the emitter quantum states .",
    "the parameters @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath115 are configuration dependent .",
    "since the emitters undergo spontaneous transitions the parameters fluctuate accordingly . explicitly taking into account all the details of the fluctuations",
    "would greatly complicate the model .",
    "instead , we employ the central limit theorem stating that any ensemble of equal distributions can be described as a gaussian distribution when the number of distributions goes to infinity",
    ". therefore , since we have a large number of emitters , as described above , we may regard the parameters as stochastical quantities with gaussian distributions .    in principle",
    ", the noise in all parameters is expected to be of the same order of magnitude relative to their average values . however , since @xmath106 is of lower order in the taylor expansion of eq .",
    ", its fluctuations are more important than that of @xmath107 and @xmath115 .",
    "we therefore only consider a single noise source by taking @xmath107 and @xmath115 to be equal to their average values , while @xmath124 , with @xmath125 being the average value and @xmath126 being the deviation .",
    "the latter appears in eq .   as an addition to the detuning",
    "the noise can therefore be seen as fluctuations in detuning or in the resonant frequency .",
    "the corresponding variance , @xmath127 , is an important parameter of our general model .",
    "we shall take into account that emitters switch on a certain time scale that determines autocorrelations of these detuning fluctuations .",
    "the autocorrelation function is thus given by@xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the inverse autocorrelation time of the emitter ensemble    it is possible to capture all relevant dynamics compactly in a single nonlinear fokker - planck equation .",
    "this is an equation for the probability distribution function @xmath130 of three real values , two of them are represented in the optical field and the third in the detuning deviation .",
    "the drift and diffusion terms in the equation respectively describe deterministic and noise driven , indeterministic processes.@xcite the fokker - planck equation for our device encompasses two gaussian noise sources , describing fluctuations in three quantities .",
    "first , there is the dynamics of @xmath97 which is subjected to a noise source , @xmath131 , describing the fundamental fluctuations in @xmath97 .",
    "this is the quantum noise associated with the discrete changes of photon number in the resonator mode .",
    "it satisfies , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "second , as discussed , the noise in @xmath106 is equivalent to detuning fluctuations .",
    "this is represented by the quantity @xmath126 , with average @xmath134 and variance @xmath127 .",

    "are the drift terms .",
    "evaluating @xmath136 by using eq .   will yield the self - consistency equation   for @xmath137 .",
    "we remark that in this context the brackets , @xmath138 , denote the average over the classical distribution @xmath139 , and _ not _ the expectation value of the operator @xmath140 .",
    "the diffusion is described by the second derivative terms on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "let us note that all the parameters we use have the dimension of frequency .",
    "it is convenient to make them dimensionless , measuring them in relative units of @xmath141 .",
    "this amounts to setting @xmath142 in eq .  .",
    "for clarity , we rescale the detuning deviation in eq .",
    "to appropriate units , by taking @xmath143 , which is the scale of the frequency domain where lasing is possible , as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] .",
    "additionally we have @xmath144 . as a consequence , the term in eq .",
    "proportional to @xmath145 changes to @xmath146 .",
    "other terms retain their form .",
    "we conclude this section by stressing that this fokker - planck equation applies to a whole class of lasers , where a biased josephson junction contains a structure of which the eigenstates couple to both superconducting leads and which can emit light by electron - hole recombination into the resonator mode .",
    "in the previous section we have derived a model for a class of lasers that is driven by superconductivity and that exhibits a phase lock . here",
    "we show that lasing with a phase lock is indeed possible and we give expressions for the lasing threshold and the number of photons in the resonator mode .",
    "we find three different regimes , with a different number of stationary lasing states .",
    ", for the stationary solutions of eq .  , as a function of the rescaled detuning @xmath147 , with @xmath148 .",
    "thick solid ( dashed ) lines represent stable ( unstable ) solutions , labeled by @xmath149 .",
    "three parameter regimes , ( i , ii and iii ) , are found based on the number of stationary solutions .",
    "the vertical dotted lines represent boundaries between these regimes . below this plot",
    "is a panel that illustrates the existing stationary solutions in the @xmath150-@xmath151 plane , for each regime .",
    "solutions with @xmath152 occur twofold with opposite sign .",
    "solid ( empty ) circles represent stable ( unstable ) stationary states .",
    "the bottom panel shows the dependence of the regimes on the parameters @xmath153 and @xmath147 .",
    "the diagonal lines are the lasing thresholds @xmath154 as discussed in the main text .",
    "the line between regimes ii and iii is the one where @xmath149 becomes real - valued .",
    "the plot of the upper figure is taken along the dashed line . when crossing the boundary along arrow(s ) ( i ) and ( ii ) [ ( iii ) ] , the system undergoes a second [ first ] order phase transition . ]",
    "a full description of the dynamics of lasing would require solving fokker - planck equation  , but this is difficult , if not impossible , even for a relatively simple system such as ours .",
    "instead , we first search for stationary lasing solutions to the deterministic equation of motion , eq .  , thus disregarding noise .",
    "once these solutions are found we study the effects of noise when near a stable stationary lasing state .",
    "this is the topic of the subsequent two sections .    to find the desired stationary solutions to eq .  ,",
    "with @xmath155 , we rewrite them as real equations . defining @xmath156 leads to a set of equations , @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the photon number in the resonator mode .",
    "these equations can be readily solved to find an expression for @xmath2 and for the phase of @xmath97 , which was defined as @xmath159 , @xmath160 , \\\\",

    "we stress that the values of @xmath310 at each time @xmath311 remain strictly independent from the ones at other times @xmath312 .",
    "so how does this concept of histories aid us ? even though the langevin forces might have infinitesimally short autocorrelation times , the vector field @xmath313 will need some finite time to relax to the stationary state . during this time",

    "the resulting cumulative effect of fluctuations is best captured by using eq .   to rewrite the exponent of @xmath139 , yielding @xmath314 hence",

    "the probability distribution , @xmath139 , is strongly reminiscent of a path integral .",
    "indeed , @xmath139 is a probability density which , upon integration over all paths , gives the probability to go from @xmath115 to @xmath296 . when fluctuations are small , as is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , the path integral is dominated by the `` classical '' path and by the quadratic fluctuations about it.@xcite the classical path is found by the principle of least action .",

    "the action as it is given in eq .",
    "is not in the most convenient form . to minimize this action we need to find both the shape of the optimal path and the speed with which the path is traveled . by exploiting the conserved hamiltonian",
    ", we can relate the speed to the force field resulting in an action where the optimal path is only determined by its shape .",
    "to show this , we choose the diffusion constants , without losing generality , as @xmath325 for all @xmath50",
    ". this is allowed , because we can always rescale @xmath326 and @xmath327 accordingly . applying this to eq .",

    "this is the regime where the quadratic fluctuations are important . far away from stationary points",
    ", however , @xmath340 can be quite large so that the absolute difference between alignment and counteralignment becomes large . then , because the action appears in the exponent , the probability to follow the deterministic path will be very close to unity .",
    "going in some other direction will cause a large increase in action .    concluding this section we make two remarks .",
    "first , the probability distribution of eq .",
    "is a solution to the fokker - planck equation   in the _ wentzel - kramers - brillouin _",
    "approximation.@xcite the solution is exact in the limit where the diffusion constants are infinitesimally small .",

    "we disregard this prefactor and only consider the action of the optimal path , which determines the order of magnitude of the coherence time .",
    "let us apply the above described ideas and calculate the action for the hjl , using the fokker - planck equation of eq .  .",
    "the fokker - planck equation contains three variables .",
    "two of them , @xmath294 , associated with the optical field , defined as @xmath343 , and one associated with the fluctuations in detuning , @xmath223 .",
    "we redefine the latter as @xmath344 , where @xmath345 is the diffusion constant of @xmath223 . as a result ,",
    "the diffusion constants associated with fluctuations in @xmath346 are all equal to one . because any fokker - planck equation , with constant diffusion terms , has an equivalent langevin equation,@xcite eq .",

    "the action for the hjl is now simply given by eq .   with the vector and the diffusion constants given by eq .",
    "now that we have discussed the formalism of optimal paths and have established the relation with the escape time , we want to find explicitly the value of the optimal action , depending on the system parameters of the hjl . before that , let us present the estimation of the action for the optimal path , @xmath315 , in different regimes .",

    "<S> we describe a superconducting device capable of producing laser light in the visible range at half the josephson generation frequency , with the optical phase of the light locked to the superconducting phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> an earlier proposed device , the so called `` half - josephson laser '' [ phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . </S>",
    "<S> lett . </S>",
    "<S> 107 , 073901 ( 2011 ) ] , can not provide long coherence times , because of spontaneous switchings between the emitter states . to circumvent this we consider @xmath0 emitters driving an optical resonator mode . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a general model that captures essential physics of such devices while not depending on specific microscopic details . </S>",
    "<S> we find the conditions under which the coherence times are exponentially long , thus surpassing the fundamental limitation on the coherence times of common lasers . </S>",
    "<S> for this we study the noise in the device . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we are interested in the rate of large fluctuations of the light field in the limit where the typical fluctuations are small . </S>",
    "<S> the large fluctuations are responsible for switching of the laser between stable states of radiation and therefore determine the coherence time .    </S>",
    "<S> all numerous degrees of freedom of a bulk superconductor are frozen at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> so its state is characterized by a single variable , the quantum phase of the superconducting order parameter.@xcite in principle , this phase remains constant , that is coherent , for infinitely long time . </S>",
    "<S> another example of a highly coherent system is a laser . </S>",
    "<S> there a macroscopic number of photons form a coherent state characterized by an optical phase and an amplitude.@xcite in contrast to superconductors the coherence time is not infinite , but limited by the intrinsic noise in the device , caused by spontaneous photon emission . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a phase drift and thus to coherence loss at typical time scales of@xcite @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the number of photons in the mode and @xmath3 the cavity escape rate . </S>",
    "<S> coupling these two very different systems may open up novel ways of controlling either of them , allowing for manipulation of one with the other .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a device has been proposed@xcite that combines the coherence of laser light with the coherence of the superconducting order parameter , dubbed the `` half - josephson laser '' ( hjl ) . </S>",
    "<S> this device was based on yet another recently proposed device , the `` josephson light emitting diode''@xcite ( joled ) , which , it was shown , can be used for quantum manipulation purposes.@xcite the light in the joled is generated by a biased semiconductor _ </S>",
    "<S> p - n _ junction realized on a nanowire . to acquire a narrow emission spectrum of the junction , </S>",
    "<S> quantum dots are defined at the _ p - n _ interface . using nanowires </S>",
    "<S> an efficient coupling can be achieved between semi- and superconductors . by connecting both ends of the described _ </S>",
    "<S> p - n _ semiconductor nanowire to superconductors , superconductivity is induced at the quantum dot regions that alter the quantum dot states . </S>",
    "<S> electrons and holes jump from the leads to the quantum dots and recombine there , emitting a photon . </S>",
    "<S> even though the joled is biased with a voltage much larger than the superconducting gap , the superconducting correlations are retained because any direct , nonradiative charge transfer is blocked by the potential barriers in the _ p - n _ junction . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - hole recombination can happen in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> a `` blue '' photon at about the josephson frequency , @xmath4 , is emitted when cooper pairs from either side of the junction recombine . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of this blue photon is locked to the superconducting phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> a process resembling spontaneous parametric down - conversion@xcite allows for the emission of two `` red '' photons in stead of a single blue one , at about half the josephson frequency , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the joled is the basis for the setup of the hjl . </S>",
    "<S> the latter exploits the emission of red photons by the joled and amplifies it by stimulated emission in an optical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of the joled , where red photons are emitted spontaneously , the red photons in the resonant mode of the hjl form a coherent state . the phase of this coherent state is locked to the superconducting phase difference .    </S>",
    "<S> lasing was found for the red emission with the optical phase locked to the superconducting phase difference , where only two values of the optical phase are allowed , having a phase difference of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the phase locking in this device is that it can result in exponentially long laser coherence times . </S>",
    "<S> the idea to prolong coherence times by phase locking has been thoroughly explored in the field of lasers.@xcite using , for instance , the technique of injection locking@xcite one could pump a laser with another one with longer coherence time , so that the pumped laser inherits this longer coherence time . however , in that case the coherence time is still limited by the fundamental noise processes in the pump laser , with some coherence time @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the essential difference with the hjl is that the laser light inherits the coherence time of the superconductors , which is infinitely long . </S>",
    "<S> it will not become infinitely long , though , because the fundamental noise in the laser is still present and causes switchings to the lasing state with opposite phase , with exponentially small probability . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the coherence times can be exponentially long .    unfortunately , despite this promising prospect , the hjl does not exhibit these exponentially long coherence times because switchings between quantum dot states result in a shorter coherence time . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and phase of the laser light depends on the actual quantum state of the joled in the hjl . </S>",
    "<S> not every state supports lasing however , and the ones that do give rise to various magnitudes and phases of the laser light . </S>",
    "<S> switchings between the quantum dot states therefore cause decoherence of the hjl . </S>",
    "<S> the switching rates are suppressed because they occur in combination with the emission of off - resonant photons , which is allowed because of the finite linewidth of the optical resonator . for an optimal choice of parameters </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , despite this very different decoherence mechanism , the coherence time is , @xmath7 , similar to that of the common laser and much shorter than the envisioned exponentially long coherence times .    </S>",
    "<S> the design for the hjl is based on a single quantum emitter , putting rather high demands on the quality factor of the optical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed@xcite to relax these demands by considering a large number , @xmath0 , emitters in a single resonator , increasing proportionally the upper bound on the damping rate at which lasing is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> as an added benefit , intensity fluctuations are expected to reduce as @xmath8 , thus realizing a less fluctuating light intensity .    in this article , we thoroughly investigate the alternative idea , where , instead of a single joled , we consider a large number of emitters forming a dipole moment to drive the optical resonator mode . </S>",
    "<S> the model that we introduce will be quite general as we will only consider macroscopic quantities and leave out the microscopic details . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial aspect of the design , the coupling of the quantum states to both superconducting leads , will of course remain , since it both drives the laser and induces the phase lock between optical phase and superconducting phase difference . the high demands on the quality factor of the resonator can be relaxed because it is driven by a big number of emitters .    we find that stationary lasing is possible with two equivalent values of the optical phase , as in the hjl , and with exponentially long coherence times owing to the phase lock . </S>",
    "<S> rather surprisingly , the sole increase in number of emitters does not directly guarantee the increased number of photons in the mode . </S>",
    "<S> the average dipole moment of all emitters will turn out to be zero when the emitters are coupled to the resonator mode only . </S>",
    "<S> incoherent emission to other modes is required to create a population imbalance,@xcite resulting in a nonzero average dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the large number of emitters , single switchings will not cause decoherence as in the hjl . </S>",
    "<S> rather , they induce minor fluctuations of the dipole moment , transferring to detuning fluctuations in the resonator mode . </S>",
    "<S> these again transfer to fluctuations of magnitude and phase of the lasing state . </S>",
    "<S> the detuning fluctuations compete with the intrinsic fluctuations of the resonator mode . </S>",
    "<S> when both are sufficiently small , the superconducting phase difference will remain locked to a single value of the optical phase . </S>",
    "<S> the major decoherence mechanism of the laser is then provided by large fluctuations , represented by the tails of the noise distributions . </S>",
    "<S> these bring the optical field to the state with opposite phase . </S>",
    "<S> large switchings occur rarely , on exponentially long time scales . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of such a feature is hard to underestimate . indeed , examining these processes we have found coherence times ( surpassing the fundamental limit for common lasers ) , scaling as @xmath9 , up to some critical value @xmath10 , where it saturates . </S>",
    "<S> while the linewidth of the laser is directly related to this coherence time , there are large tails in the line shape associated with the noise in the dipole moment as well as to the intrinsic quantum noise .    in the model we study </S>",
    "<S> , we neglect the noise source causing decoherence of the superconducting phase difference : voltage fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting phase difference is fixed only for ideal voltage bias . in case of nonideal bias </S>",
    "<S> , the voltage fluctuations will drive the phase evolution and cause the drift of the superconducting phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding coherence time can be estimated using the voltage correlation function for a junction with impedance @xmath11 @xmath12 with @xmath13 the thermal energy for temperature @xmath14 . with this the average value of the phase </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath15 where the second josephson relation and the voltage correlation function were used for the final expression . from this </S>",
    "<S> we find a coherence time of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence time can thus be prolonged by reducing temperature or impedance of the nanostructure . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively one can increase the number of josephson junctions to reduce the noise . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach is used in metrology to realize the josephson voltage standard . </S>",
    "<S> a voltage drift of a few nv per hour can be realized@xcite in that way , leading to coherence times on the order of @xmath17 s. hence the voltage fluctuations may be disregarded when studying the decoherence in the device .    </S>",
    "<S> this article is organized as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : i ] we derive the governing equations for a broader class of devices , characterized by a large number of emitters . </S>",
    "<S> we start by briefly treating the model of the hjl , as described in ref .  , and </S>",
    "<S> subsequently argue that the resulting equations can be generalized to represent a wide range of devices . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : ii ] it is shown that lasing with a phase lock occurs for these general equations in certain parameter regimes . </S>",
    "<S> there are distinguished regimes , separated by first and second order phase transitions . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : iii ] conditions are derived to determine the parameter regime where the noise can be considered in linear approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency dependence of the noise , when in a stationary lasing state , is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the noise in linear approximation can not cause the decoherence of the laser owing to the phase lock . </S>",
    "<S> however , occasional large fluctuations will cause decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> these are treated in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : iv ] , for which the formalism of optimal paths is used . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we conclude in sec .  </S>",
