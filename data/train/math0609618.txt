    "gevrey-0 series are well known : they are precisely the convergent power series for @xmath4 in a neighborhood of infinity",
    ". we will abbreviate gevrey-1 by gevrey .",
    "for example , the following series @xmath7 is gevrey .",
    "typically , gevrey power series are divergent ( for @xmath4 in a neighborhood of infinity ) , and developing a meaningful calculus of gevrey power series is a well - studied subject ; see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "gevrey power series appear naturally as formal power series solutions to differential equations  linear or not .",
    "for example , the unique formal power series solution to _",
    "euler s equation _ : @xmath8 is the series of equation .",
    "one can construct actual solutions of the ode by suitably resumming the factorially divergent series , resulting in analytic functions with an essential singularity at infinity ; see @xcite .",
    "the _ resummation process _ of a gevrey formal power series @xmath9 $ ] as in consists of the following steps :    * consider its borel transform @xmath10 , defined by : @xmath11\\ ] ] since @xmath12 is gevrey , it follows that @xmath10 is analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath13 * endless analytically continue @xmath10 to a so - called resurgent function , * medianize if needed , and * define the laplace transform of @xmath10 by : @xmath14    in the example the power series of , its borel transform @xmath10 is given by : @xmath15 which is a resurgent ( in fact , meromorphic ) function with a single singularity at @xmath16 .    in general , the output of a resummation is an analytic function ( defined at least in a right half - plane ) , constructed in a canonical way from the divergent formal power series @xmath12 . in analysis ,",
    "the resummation process commutes with differentiation , and as a result one constructs actual solutions of differential equations which are asymptotic to the formal power series that one starts with .    a side corollary of resurgence ( of importance to quantum topology ) is the existence of an asymptotic expansion of the coefficients of the power series @xmath12 . for a thorough discussion and examples ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the above description highlights the necessity of the gevrey property , as a starting point of the resummation .      as mentioned before ,",
    "a usual source of gevrey series is a differential equation or a fixed - point problem .",
    "quantum topology offers a different source of gevrey series that do not seem to come from differential equations with polynomial coefficients , due to the different structure of singularities of their borel transforms . for example ( and getting a little ahead of us ) , the kashaev invariant of two simplest knots ( the trefoil ( @xmath17 ) , and the figure eight ( @xmath18 ) ) are the power series :    @xmath19    where    @xmath20    notice that @xmath21 $ ] , thus the power series @xmath22 and @xmath23 are well - defined elements of the formal power series ring @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the power series @xmath22 is the _ kontsevich - zagier _ power series that was studied extensively by zagier in @xcite , and was identified with the kashaev invariant of the trefoil by huynh and the second author in @xcite . in @xcite , costin and the first author gave an explicit formula for the borel transform of @xmath22 :    @xcite if @xmath25 denotes the borel transform of @xmath26 , then we have : @xmath27 where @xmath28    among other things , the above formula implies resurgence of the borel transform of the series @xmath22 and locates explicitly the position and shape of its singularities .    in @xcite , costin and the first author",
    "prove by an abstract argument that the borel transform of the power series @xmath22 and @xmath23 are resurgent functions .    the paper is concerned with two formal power series of importance to quantum topology :    * the kashaev invariant of a knot , * the lmo invariant of a closed 3-manifold .    our aim is to prove that these series are gevrey .",
    "let us give a first impression the lmo invariant of le - murakami - ohtsuki , @xcite .",
    "it takes values in a ( completed graded ) vector space @xmath29 of trivalent graphs , modulo some linear as and ihx relations :    @xmath30    the lmo invariant gives a meaningful definition to chern - simons perturbation theory near a trivial flat connection .",
    "this is explained in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part i ) .",
    "the trivalent graphs are the feynman diagrams of a @xmath31-theory ( such as the chern - simons theory ) and their as and ihx relations are diagrammatic versions of the antisymmetry and the jacobi identity of the lie bracket of a metrized lie algebra .",
    "the vector space @xmath29 has a grading ( or degree ) defined by half the number of vertices of the trivalent graphs .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the subspace of @xmath33 of degree @xmath34 .",

    "simple lie algebra _",
    "@xmath35 , one can define a weight system map ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath36,\\ ] ]    where each graph of degree @xmath34 is mapped into a rational number times @xmath37 . combining the lmo invariant of a closed 3-manifold @xmath38 with the weight system of a simple lie algebra @xmath35 ,",
    "one gets a formal power series : @xmath39\\ ] ] this power series is equal to the ohtsuki series , defined by ohtsuki @xcite for @xmath40 and then by the second author for all simple lie algebras @xcite . as nice as weight systems",
    "are , the power series still depends on lie algebras ; moreover it is known that not all weight systems come from lie algebras , @xcite .",
    "ideally , we would like to replace the graph - valued invariant @xmath41 by a single series @xmath42 $ ] so that    * @xmath42 $ ] is gevrey , * the gevrey property of @xmath43 implies the gevrey property of @xmath44 for all simple lie algebras , * @xmath45 iff @xmath46 .",
    "can we accomplish this at once ?",
    "a simple idea , the gromov norm , allows us to achieve this .",

    "let us comment that the factorial growth of power series in perturbative quantum field theory is usually due to the factorial growth of the number of feynman diagrams ; see for example lemma [ lem.normalized ] .",
