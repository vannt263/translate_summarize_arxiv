    "we dedicate this study to the interplay between the nucleon sigma terms , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are defined as @xmath4 here , the up , down and strange quarks masses are indicated by @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath8 . in the following , we restrict ourselves to the isospin limit , @xmath9 , with the nucleon states having the lorentz invariant normalization @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the nucleon mass and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the spin indices .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath15 are interesting observables and their non - vanishing values would clearly indicate that quark masses are not zero and give contribution to the nucleon mass .",
    "more precisely , the values of these two sigma terms embody the internal scalar structure of the proton and neutron .",
    "if they are small , most of the nucleon mass stems from the confinement of the lightest quarks in typical distances around 1  fm .",
    "another property related to the nucleon scalar structure is the strangeness content of the nucleon , @xmath16 , which is defined as @xmath17 notice that if the ozi rule ( large @xmath18 prediction ) were exact then @xmath19 . besides their role in understanding the mass of the ordinary matter ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are also necessary with respect to theoretical speculations on the origin of dark matter particles based on supersymmetry .",
    "an accurate determination of the sigma terms is needed to constrain the parameter space of the underlying supersymmetric models from the experimental bounds in direct searches of weakly interacting dark matter particles  @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath2 is feasible from @xmath20 scattering data due to the low - energy theorem of current algebra @xcite that relates the value of the isospin even @xmath20 scattering amplitude at the cheng - dashen point with the nucleon scalar form factor @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is much more obscure for the strangeness scalar form factor of the nucleon , and then for the phenomenological determination of @xmath3 as well as of @xmath16 .",
    "historically @xcite , the path to escape this end point is based on combining the definitions of eqs .",
    "and as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the nucleon expectation value of the purely octet operator @xmath23 , @xmath24 the point to notice is that the latter operator is the only one in the qcd lagrangian responsible for the hadronic mass splitting within an @xmath25 multiplet . from the experimental values of the lightest baryon octet masses , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath12",
    ", we can then calculate approximately @xmath22 by making use of @xmath25 flavor symmetry , with the result @xcite @xmath28 where we have used @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "additionally , with this value for @xmath22 and by assuming the ozi rule to hold , so that @xmath19 , one obtains from eq .",
    "the naive estimation @xmath30  mev , that is much smaller than its phenomenological determinations from @xmath20 scattering data .",
    "for instance , gasser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the canonical result @xmath31  mev  @xcite in terms of a dispersive analysis of the pre-90s @xmath20 elastic scattering data . from the analytic continuation of the @xmath20 scattering amplitude to the cheng - dashen point",
    "see refs .",
    "a partial - wave analysis including the more modern @xmath20 database carried out by the george - washington university group @xcite , resulted in larger values of the pion - nucleon sigma term , @xmath32  mev  @xcite .",
    "besides that , a study of @xmath20 elastic scattering in lorentz covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory ( b@xmath33pt ) agrees with the dispersive results , which depend on the data set employed   @xcite .",
    "additionally , it also reveals that modern partial - wave analyses are , in general , more consistent with different scattering phenomenology than the older ones and lead to a relatively large value of the sigma - term , cf .",
    "@xmath34  mev  @xcite .",
    "the actual value of @xmath2 has important consequences on the strangeness content of the proton since , according to eq .   and",
    "the result for @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma0gmo ] ) , all these values for @xmath2 extracted from @xmath20 scattering data would imply a very large result for @xmath16 .",
    "now , at this point it is important to emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma0gmo ] ) is an estimate obtained at leading order in a @xmath0-breaking expansion and the calculation of @xmath22 from this equation could be affected by large higher order contributions .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) chiral corrections were first calculated by gasser in ref .",
    "there he obtained @xmath35 mev by employing a chiral model for the meson cloud around the baryon which only considered contributions from the virtual octet baryons . within the more evolved theoretical framework of b@xmath33pt ref .",
    "@xcite performed a calculation of the baryon masses and @xmath22 in the heavy - baryon ( hb )  @xcite expansion up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . in this work ,",
    "the contributions of the decuplet - baryon resonances were not implemented explicitly but through resonance - saturation hypothesis they contributed to several of the many low - energy - constants ( lecs ) appearing at this order .",
    "all in all , they reported the value @xmath36  mev , which was almost identical to the nlo result obtained by gasser 15 years earlier .",
    "later , ref .",
    "@xcite also included the decuplet - baryon resonances within hb@xmath33pt using a cut - off regularization scheme and still obtained basically the same result for @xmath22 .",
    "one should also notice that @xmath37  mev was taken as input in the analyses of ref .",
    "@xcite , which had a strong influence in the results of ref .  @xcite .    by employing @xmath38  mev from the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite in eq .",
    "one obtains that @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath31 mev and @xmath41  mev , respectively .",
    "in particular , the latter value would imply a strangeness contribution to the mass of the nucleon of @xmath1300  mev .",
    "although not impossible , such a scenario with a strong breaking of the ozi rule is theoretically implausible , moreover after the experimental evidence pointing to a negligible strangeness contribution in other properties of the nucleon such as its electromagnetic structure  @xcite and spin  @xcite .",
    "thus , if one gives credit to these results and translate them into a small value of @xmath16 , then the present widely accepted value for @xmath22 around 35  mev clearly discredits the relatively large values for @xmath2 favored by the most recent analysis of the @xmath20 scattering data , cf .",
    "@xmath32  mev  @xcite and @xmath34  mev @xcite .",
    "it is our aim in this work to emphasize that the situation concerning @xmath22 is not settled yet , so that the previous conclusion does not necessarily hold . on one hand ,",
    "the result of gasser  @xcite is based on a model calculation of the meson cloud around the nucleon , whereas refs .",
    "@xcite might be afflicted by the poor convergence of the chiral series typically shown by hb in the @xmath0 theory  @xcite .",
    "a suitable approach that also includes explicitly the contributions from the decuplet - baryon resonances is a lorentz covariant formulation of b@xmath33pt with a consistent power - counting via the extended - on - mass - shell renormalization ( eoms ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections that results in this approach , in a way preserving the exact analytical properties of the green functions , have been shown to tame the poorly convergent series of the hb expansion in baryonic observables as important as the magnetic moments  @xcite or masses  @xcite . moreover , once a prescription is taken to treat the problem of the interacting rarita - schwinger fields  @xcite , this scheme is straightforwardly applicable to include the contributions of the decuplet - baryon resonances  @xcite . in this work",
    "we calculate @xmath22 up to nlo using lorentz covariant b@xmath33pt renormalized in the eoms prescription and including explicitly the effects of the decuplet .",
    "we compare the results with those obtained in the hb expansion and estimate systematic higher - order effects through a partial calculation of nnlo pieces .",
    "all together , we find the remarkable result that the value of @xmath22 becomes larger so that the modern experimental determinations of @xmath42 60  mev are then consistent with a small strangeness content of the nucleon , or with a small ozi rule violation .",
    "a first indication that the decuplet contributions could help to solve the strangeness puzzle concerning a relatively large @xmath2 was given by the hb calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite . indirectly , this was also the case in ref .",
    "@xcite where very large and negative values of @xmath3 were obtained when demanding @xmath37  mev , indicating a larger @xmath22 .",
    "in b@xmath33pt . the internal solid lines correspond , in general , to any octet baryon , double lines to decuplet - baryon resonances and dashed lines to mesons .",
    "the black dots indicate @xmath43-order couplings while crosses are insertions of @xmath44 operators given by the lecs @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 responsible for the leading @xmath0 breaking of the baryon - octet masses .",
    "[ fig : masses],width=453 ]    the expressions for the sigma terms can be obtained either from the explicit calculation of the scalar form factor of the nucleon at @xmath48 or applying the hellmann - feynman theorem to the chiral expansion of its mass , @xmath49 we follow the latter strategy since the explicit expressions for the baryon masses in the different schemes treated in this paper can be directly obtained using the appendix of ref .",
    "thus , the chiral expansion of the sigma terms up to nlo from eq .   is written as , @xmath50 the first line in these formulas corresponds to the lo contribution given at tree - level by the same @xmath44 lecs that appear in the chiral expansion of the baryon masses . while @xmath45 provides a @xmath0-singlet contribution that can not be disentangled from the bulk mass of the octet baryons , the lecs @xmath46 and @xmath47 induce a splitting of octet - baryon masses ( tree - level in diagram * _ ( a ) _ * in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] ) which gives rise to the gmo relation  @xcite .",
    "the second lines enclose the nlo or @xmath51 corrections that stem from the loop topologies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] * _ ( b ) _ * and * _ ( c)_*.",
    "thus , the effect of virtual octet ( @xmath52 ) and decuplet ( @xmath53 ) baryons is explicitly accounted for .",
    "their contributions are weighted by the coefficients @xmath54 , which are combinations of @xmath25 clebsch - gordan coefficients and the meson - baryon couplings @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( octet contributions ) and @xmath57 ( decuplet contributions ) .",
    "the loop functions @xmath58 depend , exclusively , on the mass of the virtual pseudoscalar meson and on the ones of the octet and decuplet baryons in the chiral limit , @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively . strictly speaking , the @xmath0 breaking of the baryon masses in these loops , which are represented by the crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] * _ ( b ) _ * and * _ ( c ) _ * , are contributions that start at nnlo or @xmath61 .    for the baryon masses we use the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in lorentz covariant b@xmath33pt up to @xmath51 in eoms .",
    "the chiral loops contain divergences and analytic pieces breaking the power - counting formula  @xcite that are removed in dimensional regularization by the proper redefinition of the bare lecs ( eoms scheme  @xcite ) .",
    "the contributions of the decuplet baryons are included taking the octet and decuplet masses in the chiral limit of approximately the same order .",
    "namely , the octet and decuplet contributions are considered on the same footing for power - counting purposes and no specific expansion in @xmath62 is performed .",
    "the hb formulas  @xcite can be always recovered from the renormalized covariant results by taking the non - relativistic expansion @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , the hb results within the small - scale - expansion ( sse )  @xcite , that it is used to include explicitly the decuplet resonances , . ]",
    "are retrieved once the hb expansion is performed in our results  @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to appreciate the improvement in the chiral expansion that results by employing lorentz covariant b@xmath33pt in the eoms we compare our results for @xmath19 , quite close to the last line value in table  [ table : strangeness ] , with the hb@xmath33pt calculations with / without the decuplet - baryon resonances in table  [ table : sigma0 ] .",
    "as we can see , the corrections to the lo result on @xmath22 studied are large .",
    "this occurs despite that the discrepancy of the gell - mann - okubo equation is correctly predicted in any of these schemes and , in fact , the description of the experimental octet mass splittings improves at @xmath51  @xcite . as already anticipated by the calculation of the @xmath61 pieces in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : systematics ] ) , the @xmath0 hb expansion has severe problems of convergence in the description of the sigma terms at @xmath64 .",
    "the huge central value and errors of @xmath22 for the hb - sse expansion has to be regarded as a clear manifestation of these problems .",
    "another one is the large variation in the value of @xmath22 between hb and hb - sse . on the contrary , for the covariant calculation",
    "the difference between the calculations excluding / including the explicit decuplet of baryon resonances is only of around 10  mev , much smaller than the difference between the lo and nlo results in the purely octet formulation of the theory .",
    "this indicates a stabilization of the final outcome at the @xmath64 value for the covariant case .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with those derived from the analyses of other observables  @xcite that also indicated similar problems of convergence for the hb studies in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "similar comments can be done concerning the value of @xmath45 and its variations when comparing with the different levels of sophistication in the calculation .",
    "e.g. one observes a change in @xmath45 between hb and hb - sse in table  [ table : sigma0 ] that is a factor 3 times larger than for the covariant calculations .",
    "the main result of our study is having shown that @xmath65  mev is perfectly compatible with a rather accurate fulfillment of the ozi rule and , hence , with a small strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "in other words , there is no argument against relatively large values of @xmath2 based on the ozi rule , as @xmath22 can be afflicted by important systematics as those driven by properly accounting of the relativistic corrections and the explicit inclusion of the decuplet resonances .",
    "other outcome of our work is that the value of @xmath22 obtained using the experimental baryon - octet mass splittings , lorentz covariant b@xmath33pt in eoms up to @xmath51 with explicit decuplet - baryon resonances as degrees of freedom , favors @xmath65 mev .",
    "however , for this result to hold higher order corrections should be under control .",
    "indeed , this seems to be the case as indicated by our calculation of a sub - set of known @xmath66 diagrams .",
    "unfortunately , first complete studies of lqcd results at @xmath61 in @xmath25 b@xmath33pt @xcite are not conclusive on this respect yet , as large variations in the sigma terms are found between different strategies . ref .",
    "@xcite concludes @xmath67  mev , @xmath68  mev and @xmath69 , while ref .",
    "@xcite results with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "further work in this direction , ideally including more observables , experimental data and lqcd results to tackle the large number of unknown lecs appearing at @xmath72 , will be necessary to settle this question .",
    "we also show two results from lqcd without employing b@xmath33pt , ref .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath73  mev , @xmath74  mev and @xmath75 , while ref .",
    "@xcite determines @xmath16 with the value @xmath76 .",
    "these direct lqcd calculations clearly suggest a small value for @xmath16 and a subsequent contribution to the nucleon mass due to strangeness of around the same size as from the lightest quark masses .",
    "other calculations supplying lqcd results with different formulations of b@xmath33pt are @xcite . in these studies a small value for @xmath16 results , compatible with our own determination in the last line of table  [ table : strangeness ] .",
    "there is also a tendency in the lqcd results favoring the phenomenological determination @xmath77  mev  @xcite , although within present uncertainties the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is compatible at the level of one sigma with the larger value @xmath34  mev  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have revisited an old empirical relation between the strangeness content of the nucleon and the pion - nucleon sigma term in the context of covariant b@xmath33pt and employing only phenomenological information .",
    "earlier estimates of @xmath22 made at different levels of accuracy in @xmath33pt agreed on that a small violation of the ozi rule in the nucleon requires a value of @xmath2 close to @xmath135  mev . a long - standing puzzle",
    "@xcite has arisen from sustained experimental evidence pointing to a value of this quantity close to 60  mev , reinforced by the values obtained from modern @xmath20 databases .",
    "we have shown that the previous calculations of @xmath22 are afflicted by important systematic effects , in particular those given by relativistic corrections and by the omission of the decuplet resonances .",
    "once these are incorporated , we obtain a larger @xmath22 so that a relatively large value of @xmath2 is not necessarily inconsistent with a negligible strangeness content of the nucleon as currently indicated by experiment and lqcd . in fact , our calculation at nlo in lorentz covariant b@xmath33pt in the eoms with explicit decuplet - baryon resonances favors this scenario .",
