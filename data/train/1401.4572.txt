    "the quantum correlation for a quantum state contain entanglement and other type of nonclassical correlations .",
    "it is known that the quantum correlations are more comprehensive than entanglement @xcite .",
    "a prominent and widely approved quantity of quantum correlation is the quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite which indicates the quantumness of correlations .",
    "considerable progresses have been made about the significance and applications of quantum discord .",
    "particularly , there are strict expressions for quantum discord for some two- qubit states , like as for the x states @xcite . despite of quantum discord ,",
    "a lot of other measures of quantum correlation have been given , such as the gmqd @xcite , mid @xcite and quantum deficit @xcite .",
    "lately girolami et .",
    "@xcite proposed the concept of local quantum uncertainty which determines the uncertainty in a quantum state as a result of measurement of a local observable .",
    "however , such quantifier is strong criterion to be considered as a accurate measure of quantumness in quantum states .",
    "although because of inherent optimization , finding explicit expression is a difficult problem for most of the quantum correlations measures .",
    "for instance , the value of quantum discord is not known even for general bipartite qubit system . in bipartite systems with higher dimension ,",
    "the results are known for only some certain states .",
    "nevertheless , local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) has closed form only for any qubit - qudit system .",
    "+ quantum dot ( as the artificial atoms ) devices are a well- controlled object for studying quantum many- body physics .",
    "also , ground state single exciton qubits in quantum dots have been introduced for quantum computation tasks @xcite .",
    "so it is worthwhile , investigation of the characteristics and properties of the quantum dot . + decoherence of the quantum system due to interacting with its surrounding is the important difficulty to perform quantum computation tasks .",
    "therefore , it is inevitable to specify the dynamical properties of quantum correlations for preserve the protocol to against decoherence .",
    "many investigation have been paid to dynamics of quantum correlations both theoretically and experimentally in the markovian @xcite and non- markovian @xcite environment .",
    "for instance , there is an many investigation on decoherence due to spin environment @xcite , like single qubit coupled to the environment and two qubits coupled to the environment .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to study qd and lqu in a vertical quantum dot .",
    "their dependencies on magnetic field and temperature are also investigated .",
    "+ the parer is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we recall qd , lqu briefly . in sec .",
    "3 we will investigate these quantities in vertical quantum dot and give a detailed comparison .",
    "the effect of magnetic field and temperature are illustrated .",
    "is devoted to the dynamics of qd in dephasing and amplitude damping model , and the dynamics of lqu is compared with that of qd . in the last section , the conclusions are given .",
    "[ [ qd ] ] qd ~~    for a bipartite quantum system , the quantum mutual information between the two subsystems a and b is as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is von- neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum mutual information has fundamental physical importance , and is generally applied as a measure of total correlations that contain quantum and classical ones .",
    "the classical correlation may be defined by projective measurement .",
    "assume one carry out a set of projective measurements @xmath3 on the subsystem b , then the probability of measurement with outcome k is @xmath4 $ ] where @xmath5 the identity operator for subsystem a. after this measurement , the state of subsystem a is characterized by the conditional density operator @xmath6/p_k$ ] .",

    "the maximum is taken for whole probable types of projective measurements . finally , the quantum discord is specified as the difference between the total and classical correlations @xcite .",
    "@xmath10      lately , a measure of quantum correlations for bipartite quantum systems namely the local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) is introduced by d. girolami @xcite .",
    "the lqu is defined as follows : @xmath11 where the two parts denoted by a and b , the minimum is optimized over all of the non degenerate local projective operators on part a : @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ^ 2\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the information which introduced in ref .",
    "the closed form of the lqu for @xmath14 quantum systems is @xcite : @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the maximum eigenvalue of the @xmath17 matrix w with the elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 is the pauli matrices .",
    "in this section , we will investigate qd and lqu in a vertical quantum dot .",
    "the effects of magnetic field and temperature on these outstanding characteristics of quantum physics are demonstrated .",
    "moreover , we will compare these quantities and illustrate their different properties .",
    "+ the reduced hamiltonian of the quantum dot is written as @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath23 is the bare value at b = 0 and @xmath24 is the third component of total spin .",
    "@xmath25 is the magnetic field of the degenerate point , @xmath26 is the level spacing and @xmath27 is the exchange energy .    in the standard basis , @xmath28 , the density matrix @xmath29 of the system reads @xcite @xmath30 in which the nonzero matrix elements are given by @xmath31;\\nonumber\\\\ y=\\frac{1}{2}[\\exp(\\frac{-k_0}{16t})-\\exp(\\frac{3k_0}{16t})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath25 always appear in the form @xmath33 and thus we can consider it as @xmath34 . + we can find that , the ground state of the hamiltonian in eq . ( 7 ) become separable when the magnetic field is strong enough . in addition",
    ", the ground state will be entangled when the @xmath35 is large enough ( for more detail see the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of reduced hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 7 ) in @xcite ) . from this aspect",
    ", we can say that a strong magnetic field will shrink the quantum correlation measured by the qd , however a large @xmath35 can cause a large amount of quantum correlation .",
    "+ the matrix ( 8) is the x- matrix whose discord has been studied in @xcite . although this reference contains a mistake concerning the number of arbitrary optimization parameters in the calculation of the classical part of mutual correlations @xcite , this mistake is not important in our case because the element @xmath36 is zero in density matrix ( 8) . as a consequence , we have only one optimization parameter .",
    "thus , we use the algorithm developed in the above reference for the calculation of discord . by the density matrix given in eq .",
    "( 8) , we can find the analytical expressions of qd as given in ref .",
    "the qd of the density matrix in eq .",
    "( 8) can be computed directly and it takes the following expression : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 read respectively as :    @xmath40,\\\\\\nonumber & -\\frac{1}{z}[u\\log_2{\\frac{u}{w+u}}+w\\log_2{\\frac{w}{w+u}}],\\\\\\nonumber & d_2=s(\\rho_a)-s(\\rho)-\\frac{1-\\gamma}{2}\\log_2\\frac{1-\\gamma}{2}-\\frac{1+\\gamma}{2}\\log_2\\frac{1+\\gamma}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath2 in eq .",

    "the analytical expression of qd shows that the qd depends on the temperature , the magnetic field and @xmath35 .",
    "+ the lqu of the thermal density matrix in eq .",
    "( 8) takes the expression of    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the eigenvalue of the @xmath17 matrix w. + after calculations , we find that qd and lqu are symmetric under change of r to -r , so we will consider only @xmath47 in our calculations . the influence of parameters on qd and lqu in quantum dot is discussed in detail as follows .",
    "+     and fix @xmath35 and t.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   and fix @xmath35 and t.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]     and fix @xmath48 and t.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   and fix @xmath48 and t.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    .,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    .,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    at first , we analyze the sensitivity of the parameters @xmath35 and r for the qd and the lqu and the results are given in figures 1 and 2 . from figures 1 and 2 we can see that the behaviors of qd and lqu are similar to a large extent . when the temperature is not zero , qd and lqu changes with the r when the @xmath35 is fixed .",
    "the higher the r is , the smaller the qd is , and the smaller the lqu is . in this sense , we can find that high r can shrink the qd and lqu . also , both of qd and lqu decreases asymptotically to a very small value . from figure 2",
    "we can see that @xmath49 show more quantum correlation than @xmath50 and large @xmath35 cause large quantum correlation .",
    "although for @xmath50 , there is no entanglement ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , qd and lqu exist .",
    "moreover , we can see that when r is zero quantum correlations have higher value this is because the ground state become the maximally entangled state .",
    "+ secondly , we examine the effect of the temperature on the qd and the lqu and the results are given in figure 3 . from figure 3 , for the case @xmath51 , the qd and lqu decreases by increasing temperature .",
    "nevertheless , they decreases more slowly when the temperature is higher . from figure 3",
    ", we can find that the qd and the lqu is not sensitive to the magnetic field when the temperature takes a value larger than about 2 .",
    "this point indicates that the quantum correlation measured by the qd and lqu may not be affected by the magnetic field efficiently when the system temperature has high value . as to give a better illustration about the sensitivity of the qd and the lqu to the temperature , we plot figure 4 . from figure 4",
    ", we can find that the qd and lqu is sensitive to the magnetic field when the temperature is low .",
    "while for the high temperature of the case t=4 , they are not sensitive anymore and remain stable .",
    "in order to calculate the quantum discord between two qubits subject to dissipative channels , we consider the following approach .",
    "the dynamics of two qubits which interacting independently with distinct environments is described by the solutions of the born - markov - lindblad equations @xcite , that can be acquired appropriately by the kraus operator method @xcite . given an initial state for two qubits @xmath52 , its time evolution can be written as @xmath53 where the kraus operators @xmath54 @xcite satisfy @xmath55 for all t. the operators @xmath56 characterize the one- qubit quantum channel effects .",
    "we present below what happens to the qd and lqu in for two qubit of the dephasing and amplitude damping channels .      here",
    "we examine time evolution of the vertical quantum dot under first phase damping and then amplitude damping channels .",
    "we will begin by obtaining the time dependence of qd and lqu for the vertical quantum dot .",
    "recently , it has been shown that for some bell- diagonal states ( bds ) , their quantum discord are invariant under some decoherence for a finite time interval @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is that such phenomenon occurs in other systems ?",
    "+ in the next of this section we consider that the state of density matrix @xmath2 in eq .(8 ) undergoes the dephasing channel .",
    "kraus operators for a dephasing channel given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath42 denoting decay rate @xcite .",
    "under the effect of phase noise the only time dependence is in y and other element in density matrix remain unchanged : @xmath60 in fact , the time- dependent parameter @xmath22 may be different for qubits a and b , but we take it identical .",
    "+ the results are shown in figure 5 .",
    "we can see that the behavior of qd and lqu under the effect of this channel is different .",
    "in particular we note the evolution of qd , which its smoothly behavior at a finite time is noticeable ( and remains stable )",
    ". however , lqu by increasing t decrease monolitically .     and @xmath35 in the case of r=1 and t=0.4.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   and @xmath35 in the case of r=1 and t=0.4.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]      next we consider time evolution under amplitude noise .",
    "kraus operators for an amplitude damping channel given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we find from the appropriate kraus operators given in @xcite that the following time dependence determine @xmath63 at any time : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 indicate decay rate of the qubits .",
    "the results are in figure 6 .",
    "we can see from figure 6 that against dephasing channel case , here the behavior of qd and lqu is similar approximately .",
    "both of them decrease asymptotically by growing time , while increase by growing the absolute value of @xmath35 .     and @xmath35 in the case of r=1 and t=0.4.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   and @xmath35 in the case of r=1 and t=0.4.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]",
    "in summary , we have investigated qd and lqu in a vertical quantum dot .",
    "our results imply that the qd and lqu depends on the magnetic field , @xmath35 and the temperature of the system in equilibrium .",
    "the behavior of the lqu is similar to that of the qd to large extent .",
    "they change smoothly without any sudden transitions .",
    "the larger @xmath35 is , the larger the qd is and the stronger the magnetic field is , the smaller the qd is . with regard to the effect of temperature , we find that the higher the temperature is , the smaller the qd is .",
    "specifically , the qd is not sensitive to the change of temperature when the temperature is higher than a value of about 2 .",
    "moreover , we have studied the dynamics of qd in dephasing and amplitude damping model , and the dynamics of lqu is compared with that of qd . in particular we note the evolution of qd in dephasing channel , which its smoothly behavior at a finite time is noticeable ( and remains stable ) .",
