    "despite the big efforts made in the last two decades in trying to understand the origin of the density profile of galaxies and clusters , the situation is still very confused .",
    "is the typical density profile of halos mainly the result of accretion ( spherical secondary infall ) or of repetitive major mergers ( strong violent relaxation ) ?",
    "does it arise , on the contrary , from secular evolution due to the effects of dynamical friction plus the tidal stripping of captured satellites ?",
    "or is it some combination of the preceding processes ?",
    "recently , two empirical facts have emerged from high resolution cosmological n - body simulations which seem to have important implications on this longstanding debate .",
    "first , the spherically averaged density profile of dark - matter halos is universal ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; cole & lacey 1997 ; tormen , bouchet , & white 1997 ) , its exact form being however controversial ( see moore et al .",
    "the various laws proposed can be encapsulated within the general expression @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for the nfw profile , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for the moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) profile .",
    "the classical king law and the hernquist  ( 1990 ) profile also admit this general form for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath3 , and @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath9 , respectively . in equation ( [ rho ] ) , @xmath10 is the radial distance to the halo center in units of the scale radius @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the characteristic halo density in units of the critical density of the universe .",
    "the dimensional parameters @xmath13 and @xmath11 are linked by the condition that the mean density within the virial radius @xmath14 of a halo of a given mass is a constant factor @xmath15 times @xmath16 ; here we adopt @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the density profiles of halos at a given epoch depend on their mass @xmath18 through a unique parameter , @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "second , the smaller the mass of halos , the denser they are ( nfw , cole & lacey 1997 ) or , equivalently , @xmath19 is a decreasing function of @xmath18 .",
    "this mass - density correlation is interpreted as reflecting the fact that , in hierarchical clustering , less massive halos form typically earlier when the mean density of the universe is higher . according to this interpretation the structural properties of halos",
    "would be fixed at their time of formation .",
    "as major mergers yield a substantial rearrangement of the system , while accretion only causes its smooth evolution , this would point to the fact that violent relaxation taking place after major mergers is the main responsible for the halo density profiles .",
    "nfw have shown , indeed , that the characteristic density of halos with a given mass at a given epoch is proportional to the mean cosmic density when they form .",
    "this connection between the characteristic density of halos and their formation time strongly favors the previous interpretation of the mass - density correlation .",
    "however , the physics behind such a proportionality is unclear .",
    "moreover , the halo formation time adopted by nfw does not correspond to the last major merger experienced by these systems .",
    "here we report the results of a similar analysis of the mass - density correlation recently performed by salvador - sol , solanes , & manrique ( 1998 , ssm ) using a better suited formation time estimate .",
    "not only does our analysis confirm the origin proposed by nfw for the mass - density correlation , but also provides a physical base for the proportionality between halo characteristic density and cosmic density at formation .",
    "furthermore , our results point to a complete picture for the evolution of halo structure as a consequence of the interplay of accretion and major mergers .",
    "to follow the formation and evolution of halos , ssm have used a slightly modified version of the extended press - schechter ( 1974 , ps ) clustering model , known to agree with n - body simulations .",
    "the only change introduced consists on including a schematic distinction between minor and major mergers .",
    "such a distinction does not obviously alter the success of the basic model while it allows one to define the formation of a halo as the last major merger it experiences .",
    "we say that a halo of mass @xmath18 experiences a major merger and is destroyed when the relative mass captured by a halo @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the increment of mass , exceeds a certain threshold @xmath23 .",
    "otherwise , the event is regarded as an accretion and the capturing halo keeps its identity .",
    "consequently , the mass - accretion and destruction rates of halos of mass @xmath18 at @xmath24 are respectively given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the specific merger rate in the usual extended ps model ( lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "the distinction between minor and major mergers does not modify the mass function of halos at @xmath24 , @xmath28 , which therefore takes the standard ps form .    as a result of major mergers ,",
    "some halos are destroyed and other halos form . the formation rate of halos with mass @xmath29",
    "can then be obtained from the conservation equation @xmath30={{{\\rm d}}\\ln n[m(t),t]\\over { { \\rm d}}t}+r^{\\rm d}[m(t),t]+ \\partial_m r^{\\rm a}_{\\rm mass}(m , t)\\bigl|_{m = m(t ) } \\label{conserv}\\ ] ] for the number density of halos per unit mass along mean accretion tracks , @xmath31 , solution of the differential equation @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "finally , from this formation rate , one can compute the distribution of formation times for halos of mass @xmath33 at @xmath34 ( see ssm for details ) @xmath35\\ , \\exp\\biggl\\{-\\int_t^{t_0 } r^{\\rm f}[m(t'),t']\\,{{\\rm d}}t'\\biggr\\}\\ , , \\label{dtf}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 the mean accretion track satisfying @xmath36 . the median value for this distribution function is then taken as the typical formation time @xmath37 of such halos .    at this stage , the value of @xmath23 establishing in a simple way the frontier between accretion and major mergers must be regarded as a phenomenological parameter of the model . its value will be fixed in the next section through fits to the empirical mass - density ( or mass - radius ) correlation , the only data which seems to be connected with the distinction between merger and accretion",
    "as shown in figure [ fig-1 ] , the empirical @xmath38 correlation for present halos is well fitted , in all the cosmogonies analyzed , by the simple proportionality between the halo characteristic density @xmath39 and the mean density @xmath40 of the universe when halos form proposed by nfw @xmath41 ^ 3,\\label{fit}\\ ] ] provided that the mass threshold for merger takes the very natural value of 0.6 .",
    "similarly good fits are also obtained for this same value of @xmath23 in low @xmath42 cosmogonies if @xmath39 is taken instead proportional to the critical density for closure @xmath43 at the time of halo formation .",
    "this new model , which assumes that the dimensionless characteristic density of halos at their time of formation is equal to the cosmogony - dependent constant @xmath44 , while the value of its dimensional counterpart @xmath13 remains fixed since that epoch , is described by the relation @xmath45}\\,[1+z_{\\rm f } ( m_0)]^3.\\label{fit2}\\ ] ]    in fact , the similarity between the empirical distribution function of halo characteristic densities and the theoretical one implied by this latter relation , suggests that eq .",
    "( [ fit2 ] ) holds also for individual halos .",
    "more importantly , in contrast with the relation ( [ fit ] ) proposed by nfw , eq .",
    "( [ fit2 ] ) has a clear physical interpretation : violent relaxation occurring after major mergers produces virialized halos with identical dimensionless density profiles , which remain essentially unaltered during the accretion phase , except for the continuous stretching of their outer boundaries caused by the secular decrement of the critical density of the universe .",
    "given the tight relation between the characteristic density and the scale radius of halos of a given mass at a given epoch , if the evolutionary scheme we are proposing is correct , the value at formation of the dimensionless scale radius @xmath46 of halos should also be universal , while the associated dimensional parameter @xmath11 should keep its value invariant between major mergers . under these circumstances ,",
    "the scale radius @xmath11 for current halos of mass @xmath33 should be proportional to the virial radius of the halos when they formed , which implies that the empirical mass - radius correlation associated with the mass - density one should be well fitted by the expression @xmath47\\}\\over r(m_0)}.\\label{fit3}\\ ] ] we want to stress that this is a new relation , independent from the two previous ones ( eqs .",
    "[ [ fit ] ] and [ [ fit2 ] ] ) . indeed , to verify it we need to estimate the mass of halos at the time of their formation ( i.e. , when they experienced their last major merger ) , so a clustering model such as",
    "the one developed in the preceding section is necessary .",
    "in contrast , the verification of the two previous relations does not require any clustering model .    as can be seen from figure [ fig-2 ] , relation ( [ fit3 ] )",
    "gives very good fits , indeed , to the empirical correlations for all cosmogonies , provided , once again , that @xmath23 is equal to 0.6 .",
    "furthermore , as shown in table [ tbl-1 ] , the best fitting values of @xmath48 are in very good agreement with the values of this parameter implied independently by the best fits obtained from relation ( [ fit2 ] ) above .",
    "these results therefore give strong support our physical interpretation of the fitting formulae .",

    "for @xmath65 @xmath66 , the empirical mass - density obtained in a number of different cosmogonies is very well fitted by the simple relations ( [ fit ] ) or ( [ fit2 ] ) .",

    "such a behavior for the scaling parameters of halo density profiles is very well understood as the combined result of the different dynamical effects of major mergers and accretion .",
