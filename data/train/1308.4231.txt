    "the anomalous thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of water is known to play a fundamental role not only in many physical and chemical processes in materials science , but also in biological , geological and terrestrial processes in nature  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a lot of effort has been devoted to rationalizing water s anomalous behavior in a coherent and simple physical picture , but no consensus has yet emerged .",
    "one of the breakthroughs in this endeavor was the discovery of water s polyamorphism , i.e. the existence of amorphous coexisting phases in the supercooled region of the phase diagram .",
    "distinct states have indeed been found in glassy water , called low - density ( lda ) , high - density ( hda ) and very high - density ( vhda )  @xcite amorphous ices , which can interconvert with each other by the application of pressure .",
    "it is believed that the transition between the amorphous ices connects to a liquid - liquid first - order phase transition line above the glass transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) , and terminates at a critical point  @xcite , but the fundamental nature of this transition is still being debated  @xcite .",
    "the verification of the liquid - liquid critical point scenario ( llcp ) is hindered by water s crystallization at large supercooling  @xcite , so that much of the evidence comes from computer simulation studies  @xcite , and only indirectly from experiments where crystallization is suppressed either by strong spatial confinement  @xcite or by mixing an anti - freezing component  @xcite .    one way to understand water s polyamorphic behavior is to introduce the concept of locally favored structures @xcite , which are defined as particular long - lived molecular arrangements which correspond to some local minima of the free energy . in this view , water s polyamorphism comes from the competition between two different types of molecular arrangements  @xcite : one in which the different tetrahedral units form open structures , and the other with a smaller specific volume due to a high degree of interpenetration .",
    "the presence of two amorphous fluid phases has indeed been observed in computer simulations of some models of water , where the freezing transition can be avoided  @xcite .",
    "but whether locally favored states exist above the critical region is still a matter of debate .",
    "many physical quantities exhibit behaviors suggestive of two states in liquid water , such as infrared and raman spectra @xcite , and the presence of an isosbectic point in raman spectra has been regarded as a clear indication supporting a mixture model since its finding by walrafen @xcite .",
    "some evidence for the inhomogeneous structure of water was also reported in experimental studies of x - ray absorption spectroscopy , x - ray emission spectroscopy and x - ray small angle scattering  @xcite , but these results are highly debated  @xcite , especially since the majority component at room temperature was proposed to be associated with the break - up of the tetrahedral structure . despite these pieces of evidence supporting a two - state picture , the lack of a clear connection between these experimental observables and the amount of locally favored structures has made it difficult to estimate the fractions of the two states in a convincing manner . from a phenomenological standpoint ,",
    "two - state models have been extremely successful in describing the anomalies of water using a restricted number of fitting parameters  @xcite , and recent simulations by cuthbertson and poole  @xcite have opened the way for a quantitative assessment of these models from miscroscopic informations , but only for state points around the widom line , i.e. , at temperatures not accessible to experiments and far from the anomalies .",
    "the essential difficulty in defining locally favored states is finding a structural order parameter that directly correlates with water s anomalies .",
    "several attempts have been made , each differing in the microscopic definition of the states involved .",
    "examples include states based on ice polymorphs  @xcite , tetrahedral order  @xcite , or relative distance between neighbors  @xcite .",
    "to overcome this difficulty , we introduce a new structural order parameter that quantifies the degree of translational order in the second shell .",
    "we show that , for one of the most reliable computer models , water anomalies are a consequence of translational ordering of the second shell and can be described very well by a two - state model .",
    "we further identify the structural characteristics of the locally favored structures of water and their link to the unusually large degree of supercooling of the liquid phase .",
    "first we explain a key idea to identify the relevant structural order parameter for characterizing the water structure .",
    "our locally favored structures correspond to local structures with low energies @xmath2 , high specific volumes @xmath3 and low degeneracy @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we denote these structures as the @xmath5 state .",
    "in contrast , thermally excited states are characterized by a high degree of disorder and degeneracy , low specific volumes and high energies .",
    "we label these structures as the @xmath6 state . in formulas , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to identify the @xmath5 state we introduce a new order parameter @xmath10 which measures local translational order in the second shell of neighbors .",
    "the importance of the second shell structure was notably pointed out by soper and ricci @xcite .",
    "translational order is a measure of the relative spacing between neighboring particles , and it is one of the fundamental symmetries broken at the liquid - to - solid transition  @xcite .",
    "locally , a molecule is in a state of high translational order if the radial distribution of its neighbors is ordered .",
    "a liquid , by definition , can not have full translational order , but it might display translational order on shorter scales .",
    "water molecules , even at high temperatures , displays a high level of tetrahedral symmetry , meaning that a high degree of translational order is always present up to the first shell of nearest neighbors . in this sense , tetrahedral order itself is not enough to describe water s anomalies .    to determine locally favored states",
    ", we focus instead on `` translational order of second nearest neighbors '' .",
    "the operational definition goes as follows ( a schematic representation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) . for water molecule @xmath11 ( labeled * 0 * in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) we order its neighbors according to the radial distance @xmath12 of the oxygen atoms ; the order parameter @xmath13 is then defined as the difference between the distance @xmath14 of the first neighbor not hydrogen bonded to @xmath11 ( with label * 5 * in the figure ) , and the distance @xmath15 of the last neighbor hydrogen bonded to @xmath11 ( labeled * 4 * ) .",
    "as we will show , the @xmath5 state having high translational symmetry , is characterized by large values of @xmath10 , with a clear separation between first and second shell ( for example when the fifth molecule is in position * 5 * in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) . but",
    "these structures should not be confused with local crystalline structures , as they generally lack orientational order , i.e. , the neighbors in the second shell are not oriented according to the crystal directions ( with well defined eclipsed and staggered configurations ) , due to their embedding in water s disordered network . in the @xmath6 state the second shell",
    "is collapsed , with a distribution of @xmath10 values roughly centered around @xmath16 ( in fig .",

    "these two states are mixed and the free energy ( @xmath17 ) of the mixture takes the form of a regular solution , i.e. , the simplest non - ideal model of liquid mixture @xcite .",

    "to test our model we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of the tip4p/2005 model of water , one of the best models of the liquid state  @xcite .",
    "simulations were run for many state points covering a large area of the liquid state , with temperatures ranging from @xmath29 k to @xmath30 k , and pressures ranging from @xmath31 kbar to @xmath32 kbar . to identify hydrogen bonds we adopted the definition found in ref .",

    "[ fig : s_structure]b . the first pattern ( * d * ) corresponds to staggered arrangements of molecules , providing strong evidence that the @xmath5 state is a precursor of crystallization , i.e. that it is along the microscopic pathway that water undergoes when transforming from liquid to solid . the second prominent structural pattern found in the @xmath5 state is denoted by * e * in fig .  [ fig : s_structure]b and it is not found in stable ice crystals .",
    "this pattern is centered around eclipsed configurations , but it is characterized by fluctuations which are distinct from the one found in the hexagonal crystal . while second nearest neighbors in crystalline configurations are involved in loops of six hydrogen - bonded oxygen atoms , the pattern in * e * is instead due to five - membered rings .",

    "the @xmath5 state is energetically stable with respect to the disordered @xmath6 state ( since each pentagon ring adds one hydrogen bond to the structure ) , but pays a high entropic cost , due to the missing degrees of freedom when closing a ring .",

    "microscopically , these states reflect the underlying crystallization behavior of water . due to its strong directional bonding",
    ", the crystallization pathway of water can be approximated in two steps : in the first step , water develops translational order , which is reflected in the population of @xmath5 states ; in the second step , it develops orientational order where the hydrogen bonds in the shell of second nearest neighbor acquire the staggered and eclipsed configurations which characterize the hexagonal and cubic forms of ice . the @xmath5-state is a locally favored state ( energetically stabilized ) with a high abundance of pentagonal rings , loops of five particles bonded to each other through hydrogen bonding .",

    "we show that locally favored structures in water not only have translational order in the second shell , but also contain five - membered rings of hydrogen - bonded molecules , indicating a mixed character of their roles in crystallization : the former helps crystallization , whereas the latter causes frustration against crystallization . this frustration effect may be related with the rather large degree of supercooling of water before homogeneous crystal nucleation of hexagonal or cubic ices takes place .",
    "finally , the validity of two - state models can be assessed not only in experimental studies of pure water , but also in water mixtures , where a liquid - liquid transition of the water component has been observed  @xcite , or in water - salt solutions , where the effect of salt on the structure of water is similar to the effect of pressure  @xcite .",

    "the fitting performs well for state points characterized by @xmath104 ( so throughout the experimentally accessible region ) , but at very low temperatures and pressures the fraction of the @xmath6 state becomes small , increasing the uncertainty of the fit .",
    "one possible way to overcome these difficulties is by noting that the @xmath6 fluid should behave like a fluid without anomalies , and thus its parameters ( @xmath100 and @xmath102 ) should be well behaved functions of @xmath36 and @xmath60 .",
    "we then choose to estimate the value of @xmath100 with a quadratic extrapolation from the values obtained at state points with @xmath104 .",
    "this procedure degrades the accuracy of the model only at the lowest temperatures and for small pressures ( as can be seen in the estimates for the isothermal compressibility maximum and the minimum in density in fig .",

    "the two - state model predictions are based on the free energy expression given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : two_state ] ) . to fully specify the model , an expression for the free energy difference between the two bulk states , @xmath105 , has to be provided . in our model",
    "this difference is expressed as a second order expansion around the known location of the liquid - liquid critical point : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we employ @xmath46 k and @xmath47 bar , which are reported for the same system  @xcite .",
    "this also fixes the value of @xmath109 .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the resulting free energy allows the calculation of the anomalous term of any thermodynamic property @xmath111 , i.e. the difference between the value of @xmath111 in the mixture and its value in a pure state ( the background ) , @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "we define the anomalous term , @xmath114 , with the following expression : @xmath115 . for example",
    ", the expressions for the density and compressibility anomalies are found respectively with first and second order derivatives of the free energy with respect to pressure @xmath116    the calculation of the absolute value of the thermodynamic properties requires a reasonable assumption on the @xmath60-@xmath36 dependence of the background part , which is usually written as a low - order polynomial .",
    "for example @xmath117 .",
    "we stress that the success of a two - state model depends on the ability to determine the location and intensity of the anomalies , which do not depend on the knowledge of the background terms .",
    "the microscopic approach described in the main text requires the knowledge of the instantaneous positions of both oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the system , thus being suitable only for computational studies .",
    "here we show that , with minor approximations , it is possible to obtain the fraction of the @xmath5 state not only from the distribution of @xmath10 but also from experimentally measurable quantities , which can probe the degree of translational order .",
    "the definition of @xmath10 involves the difference between the distance of the first non - hydrogen bonded oxygen and the last hydrogen bonded oxygen .",

    "we call this cutoff distance @xmath118 . in our simulation study",
    "we have set this distance at @xmath119 nm  @xcite .",
    "this means that if we look at two oxygen atoms whose distance is about @xmath118 , these atoms ( with high probability ) do not share an hydrogen bond . at the same time",
    "we know that in the @xmath5 state the first non - hydrogen bonded atom has a vanishingly small probability to be at distances close to the first neighbors shell ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it follows that the contribution to the radial distribution function at distance @xmath118 comes predominantly from the @xmath6 state . to clarify this point",
    ", we consider the radial distribution functions of oxygen atoms , @xmath120 , plotted in fig .",
    "continuous lines show the radial distribution function for different state points along the widom line ( where by definition @xmath54 ) : the distributions are all very close to each other , with an isosbestic point approximately at @xmath119 nm .",
    "the reason for the isosbestic point is that , as noted above , the value of the radial distribution function at @xmath118 is proportional to the fraction of the @xmath6 state , and this is constant at the widom line .",
    "coincidentally , the value of the radial distribution function at @xmath118 is approximately @xmath121 , suggesting a direct proportionality between the fraction of the @xmath6 state and @xmath122 .",
    "this is confirmed by plotting the radial distribution functions of state points with a low fraction of the @xmath6 state ( @xmath123 bar , @xmath29 k , dotted - dashed line ) and a high fraction of @xmath6 state ( @xmath124 bar , @xmath30 k , dashed line ) , where the value of @xmath122 is found to be close to @xmath125 and @xmath93 respectively .",

    "<S> water is a complex structured liquid of hydrogen - bonded molecules that displays a surprising array of unusual properties , also known as water anomalies , the most famous being the density maximum at about @xmath0c . </S>",

    "<S> here we provide its simple physical description from microscopic data obtained through computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a novel structural order parameter , which quantifies the degree of translational order of the second shell , and show that this parameter alone , which measures the amount of locally favored structures , accurately characterizes the state of water . </S>",
    "<S> a two - state modeling of these microscopic structures is used to describe the behavior of liquid water over a wide region of the phase diagram , correctly identifying the density and compressibility anomalies , and being compatible with the existence of a second critical point in the deeply supercooled region . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we reveal that locally favored structures in water not only have translational order in the second shell , but also contain five - membered rings of hydrogen - bonded molecules . </S>",
