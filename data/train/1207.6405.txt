    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) could have formed in the early universe @xcite .",
    "although there is no direct evidence of their existence of pbhs , pbhs are attracting attention as a way of constraining physics in the early universe .",
    "in particular , one of the main generation mechanisms of pbhs is the gravitational collapse of an overdense region at the horizon scale when the amplitude of the overdensity exceeds a critical threshold .",
    "therefore the resultant mass function and the abundance of pbhs depend on the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations at the horizon - crossing epoch @xcite .",
    "the pbh abundance is expected to be a probe of primordial density fluctuations on small scales , which can not be accessed by cosmic microwave background or large - scale - structure observations .",
    "constraints on the abundance of pbhs have been extensively studied and continue to be updated @xcite .",
    "pbhs with mass less than @xmath9 g have evaporated by the present epoch because the evaporation time scale by hawking radiation is less than the hubble time scale today @xcite .",
    "however evaporation of pbhs generates additional entropy in the universe after inflation , affects big bang nucleosynthesis and distorts the cmb blackbody spectrum @xcite .",
    "pbh evaporation may also produce the observable gamma - ray background @xcite . according to measurements of these cosmological phenomena ,",
    "there are strong constraints on the abundance of pbhs with mass less than @xmath9 g .",
    "pbhs with mass larger than @xmath9 g survive in the present universe .",
    "one of the constraints on such pbhs can be set from the fact that the current density parameter of pbhs , @xmath10 , can not exceed the cold dark matter density parameter observed at the present epoch , @xmath11 .",
    "conventionally , the constraint on pbh abundance is given by @xmath12 which is the fraction of regions of mass @xmath13 collapsing into pbhs at the formation epoch @xcite .",
    "the constraint on the density parameter of pbhs today , @xmath14 , implies @xmath15 from wmap 7-year data , i.e. , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "microlensing observations also constrain the abundance of non - evaporating pbhs @xcite .",
    "@xcite have obtained the constraint on pbhs with mass larger than @xmath17 , by investigating the effects of such pbhs on cosmic reionization and cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "future gravitational wave observations are also expected to provide a probe of the massive pbh abundance @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the 21  cm brightness temperature produced by pbhs and study the potential of 21  cm observations to give a constraint on the abundance of pbhs . @xcite",
    "have investigated the signatures of evaporating pbhs in 21  cm brightness temperature .",
    "accordingly , they have concentrated on pbhs whose mass range is @xmath18 . on the contrary , here ,",
    "we focus on non - evaporating pbhs with mass much larger than @xmath9 g .",
    "after the epoch of matter - radiation equality , gas and matter can accrete onto pbhs .",

    "therefore , the heated and ionized igm gas may produce an observable deviation of the 21  cm brightness temperature from the background even before the birth of the first stars and galaxies  ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to evaluate this deviation and to discuss the potential of 21  cm observations to constrain the non - evaporating pbh abundance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using a simple model of x - ray photon flux due to the accretion onto a pbh , we evaluate the ionization and temperature profile near a pbh . in section 3 , we calculate the spin temperature and the brightness temperature induced by a pbh . in section 4 ,",

    ", the accretion disk of a non - evaporating pbh can be a source of x - ray photons before first stars and galaxies form ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "for example , the non - evaporating pbhs are one of the candidates for super massive black hole seeds .",
    "pbhs whose masses exceed @xmath26 can not be directly formed through gravitational collapse since the time scale of the collapse becomes longer than cosmological time . accordingly",
    "only the accretion after the formation , which induces x - ray photon emission , makes possible to form such massive black holes @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to theoretically predict the accurate x - ray photon spectrum from pbhs , because the x - ray spectrum depends on the detailed condition of the accretion and the environment of pbhs such as the amount of neutral hydrogen .",
    "hence , for simplicity , we assume that the pbh accretion powers a miniquasar with a power - law spectrum of x - ray photons , according to @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is set to correspond to the tenth of the eddington luminosity . here",
    "we consider the range of the photon energy e from 200  ev to 100  kev since we assume that emitted photons whose energy are lower than 200  ev are immediately absorbed by the surrounding gas of the pbh .",

    "the temperature starts to decrease rapidly .",
    "because the compton cooling depends on the number of free electrons , this cooling becomes ineffective at a distance where the neutral fraction of hydrogen becomes almost unity .",
    "for example , this scale corresponds to 0.1 comoving mpc for a pbh with @xmath65 at @xmath1 .",
    "beyond this point , the temperature mildly decreases due to the cooling of the cosmic expansion .",

    "the larger the neutral hydrogen density is , the larger the heating efficiency becomes as in eq .",

    "if the density parameter is larger than these values , the angular power spectrum due to pbhs exceeds the one from primordial fluctuations and can be measured .",
    "in other words , we can not set constraints on the pbh density parameter below these values from 21  cm observations .",
    "if we consider the sensitivity of the ska - like observation , for example , we can detect the signal of pbhs up to @xmath174 at @xmath1 and @xmath175 at @xmath3 for pbhs with mass from @xmath8 to @xmath5 .",
    "the ionization of igm due to pbhs with such density parameters does not affect the global reionization history of the universe since reionization from each pbh only covers a tiny patch of the universe . unlike reionization from first stars ,",
    "therefore , such reionization has little impact on cmb temperature anisotropies . on the other hand",
    ", pbhs can heat igm regions whose scale reaches 1 - 10mpc and 21  cm fluctuations are sensitive to the heated igm regions . accordingly",
    "the pbh density parameter constrained from wmap data , that is @xmath176 @xcite , is several order of magnitude larger than the values at which 21  cm fluctuations from pbhs comparable with those from primordial density fluctuations as we mentioned above . in other words , we can conclude that , if observation instruments or foreground removal are more improved than the current ska design , 21  cm fluctuation observations have a potential to probe the pbh abundance which is impossible to access by cmb observations .",
    "the most theoretical uncertainty in this model is the flux of photons due to the accretion to pbhs . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the x - ray photon flux amplitude is a tenth of the eddington luminosity and has the power law spectrum with @xmath177 for simplicity .",
    "we also studied the effect of the power law index by changing to @xmath178 .",
    "the temperature profile shifts to a smaller scale due to the decrease of the ionization efficiency .",
    "however this shift is small , and the resultant angular power spectrum does not change much .    the amplitude of the luminosity is considered to depend on the matter accretion rate onto a pbh . @xcite have studied the luminosity for the bondi - hoyle accretion in detail .",
    "although the luminosity depends on the pbh mass and feedback effect on the ionization and temperature , they have shown that the luminosity for a pbh with @xmath179 is roughly a hundredth of the eddington luminosity at @xmath180 . in our model ,",
    "the brightness temperature profile near a pbh at a certain redshift depends only on the pbh s mass and the amplitude of the angular power spectrum is scaled by @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the amplitude of the x - ray photon flux is a hundredth of the eddington luminosity , the required density parameter for pbhs to dominate the 21  cm fluctuations due to primordial density fluctuations is @xmath182 at @xmath1 and @xmath183 at @xmath3 for pbh s mass from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
