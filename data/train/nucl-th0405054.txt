    "additionally , corrections due to electric and color charge chemical potentials are important @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the correction to the gradient term from the electric charge chemical potentials tends to decrease the surface energy .",
    "we have shown that drastic changes to @xmath101 ( an increase by a factor of 2 ) resulted in a surface tension that continued to favor the mixed phase at low density . in this case , with increasing density , we found that the gapless phase becomes favored .",
    "the location of this first order transition between the mixed phase and the gapless phase is model dependent since it is sensitive to the density dependence of the ratio @xmath155 .    an important consequence of @xmath7 corrections to the kinetic term concerns stability of the gapless phase .",
    "first we note that we can expect the matching between the kinetic coefficients for the effective theory for @xmath102 and the masses of gluons in the microscopic theory to be valid in the gapless phase . since @xmath156 in the gapless phase this implies an instability of the spatially uniform gapless phase ( the leading order gradient energy is negative ) .",
    "how this instability is resolved is not clear at this time .",
    "it is however clear that some type of heterogeneity must occur .",
    "likely candidate states include the loff phase and the mixed phase .",
    "pending a detailed investigation of the charge neutral loff state , our results suggest that this instability may be resolved by the formation of a mixed phase . in our njl model study ,",
    "the mixed phase is stable with respect to small gradient perturbations for all @xmath113 . in weak coupling , since @xmath66 in the mixed phase , the chromo - magnetic instability discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for gluons 4 - 7 in qcd does not occur in the mixed phase . in strong coupling , whether this instability persists and if so , the nature of its resolution is not yet clear .",
    "a heterogeneous quark matter ground state has important consequences for neutron star physics - were quark matter to exist inside their cores .",
    "the free energy difference between the gapless and mixed phase is small .",
    "consequently , its effects on neutron star structure will be small .",
    "on the other hand , we can expect important changes to the transport properties induced by the heterogeneity of the mixed phase . in this phase , transport of the low energy neutrinos , photons , etc .",
    ", will be dominated by coherent scattering induced by the presence of superconducting `` bubbles '' of quark matter with typical dimension of @xmath157 fm ( for a discussion of how heterogeneity affects low energy neutrino transport see ref .",
    "further , the existence of regions with normal quark matter will affect the neutrino emissivities - since they are typically large in the normal phase .",
    "finally , the crystalline structure of the mixed phase could be relevant to the modeling of glitches observed in some pulsars .",
    "we note that there are other mixed phases that could play a role in neutron stars .",
    "these include the mixed phase between quark matter and nuclear matter@xcite ; between color - flavor - locked matter and nuclear matter@xcite , or superconducting quark matter and normal quark matter@xcite .",
    "all of these share several common features : the coexistence of positively and negatively charged phases separated by an interface ; crystalline structure at low temperature ; and coincidentally typical droplet sizes of the order @xmath46 fm .",
    "however , in these aforementioned examples it is still unclear if the mixed phase is favored when surface and coulomb costs are included .",
    "this is because the surface tension is poorly known .",
    "arguments based on naive dimensional analysis indicate that the surface energy cost may indeed be too large in these systems @xcite .",
    "the exception could be the mixed phases of normal and superconducting quark matter considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the surface tension is computable and the physical considerations are very similar to those studied in this work .",
    "although quantitative aspects of the analysis presented in this work pertains to asymmetrical relativistic superconductors , our finding provide some qualitative insight into the behavior of non - relativistic superfluid that can be realized in ultra cold fermionic - atom traps being developed in the laboratory .",
    "although there is no coulomb cost associated with the mixed phase in these systems , a surface energy cost must be overcome when the surface to volume ratio is not negligible .",
    "the methods described in sec .  [ surface ] apply in general to asymmetrical fermion systems and its relevance to laboratory experiments is currently under investigation .",
