    "the phenomenon of triaxiality has remained of central importance to our understanding of galaxy dynamics since the demonstration by schwarzschild ( 1979 ) of the existence of self - consistent triaxial equilibria .",
    "schwarzschild s models had large , constant - density cores and the majority of the orbits were regular , respecting three integrals of the motion .",
    "but the realization that the central densities of elliptical galaxies and bulges are very high ( @xcite ) , and that supermassive black holes are generic components of galaxies ( @xcite ) , has modified somewhat our ideas about the persistence of triaxiality . a central black hole can destroy triaxiality on large scales by rendering the center - filling box orbits stochastic ( @xcite ) . evolution to globally axisymmetric shapes can occur in just a few crossing times if the black hole contains of order @xmath5 of the galaxy s mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "less is known about the possibility of maintaining triaxial shapes at the very centers of galaxies , where the gravitational force is contributed roughly equally by the stars and by the nuclear black hole .",
    "regular orbits , both box - like and tube - like , exist in this region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , paper i ) but the box - like orbits ( the `` pyramids '' ) have shapes that are generally contrary to the figure elongation , making them less useful than classical box orbits for maintaining a triaxial shape .",
    "furthermore the pyramid orbits disappear within the `` zone of chaos , '' which begins at a radius where the enclosed stellar mass is a few times that of the black hole ( paper i ) , roughly @xmath6 pc in a typical bright elliptical galaxy .    here",
    "we demonstrate that triaxial equilibria do in fact exist in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "we first (  2 ) use schwarzschild s technique to construct self - consistent superpositions of orbits computed in a fixed triaxial potential representing the stars and a central point mass .",
    "we then (  3 ) test the long - term stability of the models by using an @xmath4-body code to advance them forward in time ; we find that the @xmath4-body models maintain their triaxial shapes for many crossing times .",
    "finally we present some of the observable properties of the models (  4 ) and discuss the implications of triaxiality for observational and theoretical studies of galactic nuclei (  5 ) .",
    "we model the stellar nucleus as a triaxial spheroid with a power - law dependence of density on radius ,    @xmath7    inside of some surface @xmath8 discussed below .",
    "we took @xmath9 or @xmath10 ; these values correspond roughly to the density profiles observed at the centers of bright and faint elliptical galaxies , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the triaxiality @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 we chose @xmath13 for both models , corresponding to @xmath14 , `` maximal '' triaxiality .",
    "the central black hole is represented by a point mass with @xmath15 .",
    "expressions for the gravitational potential and forces corresponding to this mass model are given in paper i.    although our mass model for the stars is scale - free , the presence of the black hole imposes a scale .",
    "we identify three characteristic radii associated with the black hole . at a radius of @xmath16 , the enclosed mass in stars ( defined as the mass within an equidensity surface which intersects the @xmath17-axis at @xmath18 ) is equal to that of the black hole . in real galaxies , @xmath16 is typically a factor of @xmath19 a few greater than the `` sphere of influence '' @xmath20 , where @xmath21 depends on the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath22 the third fiducial radius is @xmath23 , the radius at which the character of the box - like orbits undergoes a sudden transition to chaos in triaxial potentials .",
    "table 1 gives values of @xmath16 and @xmath23 for our two mass models ; values of @xmath23 are approximate and are taken from paper i. table 1 also gives values of the dynamical times at @xmath16 and @xmath23 , defined as the period of a circular orbit of the same energy in the equivalent spherical potential , defined to have a scale length @xmath24 .",
    "the enclosed stellar mass within @xmath23 is about @xmath25 for @xmath9 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the orbital content of the latter solutions is described in figure 1 and table 2 .",
    "we constructed two types of solution for each @xmath3 : solutions in which only regular orbits were used ; and solutions in which all orbits ( regular and chaotic ) were provided to the schwarzschild algorithm .",
    "the dominant family of orbits in the models containing only regular trajectories was found to be the @xmath28-tubes , orbits which circulate about the short axis of the figure .",
    "plots of the individual orbits used in the solutions confirm that many of the @xmath28-tubes have the correct shape for reproducing the triaxial figure , being more elongated in @xmath17 ( the long axis ) than in @xmath29 ( the intermediate axis ) .",
    "most of the remaining contribution to the density of the regular nuclei was found to come from pyramid orbits and high - energy box orbits in the @xmath9 model , while for @xmath27 , roughly equal contributions came from pyramid orbits and from the @xmath17-tubes .",
    "( see paper i , figure 1 for illustrations of the various orbit families . )",
    "the most heavily occupied pyramid orbits had shapes similar to `` saucer '' orbits , @xmath28-tubes associated with a @xmath30 resonance ( paper i , figure 1c ) ; both models contained roughly equal numbers of saucers and pyramids .",
    "high - energy box - like orbits are more important in the @xmath9 case than in the @xmath27 case , because : ( 1 ) high - energy tube orbits in the @xmath9 model are elongated opposite to the figure ; ( 2 ) most of the high - energy regular box orbits in the @xmath27 model are bananas , which are not very useful for filling the outermost shells .    in the models",
    "constructed using both regular and chaotic trajectories , the number of stars on chaotic orbits is surprisingly high : @xmath31 for @xmath9 and @xmath32 for @xmath27 at all radii .",
    "plots of the most highly populated chaotic orbits suggest that they have reached a nearly steady state in a time - averaged sense , filling the volume defined by the equipotential surface corresponding to their energy .",
    "stationary chaotic building blocks like these have been used before when constructing triaxial models ( e.g. @xcite ) but no published triaxial models have contained nearly so large fraction of stars on chaotic orbits .",
    "we verified that our orbital superpositions correspond to true equilibria by realizing them as @xmath4-body models and integrating them forward in time in the gravitational potential computed from the @xmath4 bodies themselves and from the point mass representing the black hole .",
    "initial conditions were prepared by re - integrating all orbits with nonzero occupation numbers .",
    "the position and velocity of each trajectory were recorded at fixed time intervals ; the length of each integration was determined by the orbit s occupation number .",
    "the sense of rotation of the tube orbits was chosen randomly such that the mean motion was everywhere zero .",
    "the number of particles was @xmath33 for @xmath9 and @xmath34 for @xmath27 ; a smaller @xmath4 was chosen for @xmath27 since the @xmath4-body integrations were slower for the more condensed model .",
    "the initial conditions were then advanced in time using the @xmath4-body code gadget ( @xcite ) , a parallel tree code with variable time steps .",
    "the interparticle softening length was chosen to be @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) for @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the axis ratios of the models , computed using the iterative procedure described by dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) .",
    "the axis ratios fluctuate with time , but the models retain their triaxial figures very well over many dynamical times .",
    "no signficant evolution was seen in the radial distribution of matter .",
    "two observational signatures of triaxiality are isophote twists , and kinematic misalignments .",
    "isophote twists require a variation with radius of the intrinsic axis ratios , which is not a feature of our models .",
    "kinematic misalignments occur whenever the intrinsic angular momentum vector does not coincide with the minor axis of the figure , and are generic features of triaxial systems when both the short- and long - axis tube orbits are populated ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate the possibility of kinematic misalignments in our models in figure 3 . line - of - sight velocity contours are plotted for regular models after a fraction of the @xmath17- and @xmath28-tubes",
    "were reversed , giving the models net rotation about both the long and short axes . for @xmath9 ,",
    "all x - tubes in figure 3 rotate in the same sense while 60% of the @xmath28-tubes at each energy rotate in one sense and the remaining @xmath37 in the other . for @xmath27 ,",
    "all @xmath17-tubes rotate in the same sense around the @xmath17 axis and all @xmath28-tubes rotate in the same sense around the @xmath28-axis .",
    "rotation of the projected models along the apparent minor axis of the figure ( `` minor - axis rotation '' ) is apparent .",
    "we have shown that long - lived triaxial configurations are possible for nuclei containing black holes , whether constructed purely from regular orbits , or from a combination of regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "the latter solutions are remarkable given the large fraction of the mass on chaotic orbits , of order 50% or more ( table 2 ) .",
    "such solutions violate jeans s theorem in its standard form ( e.g. @xcite ) but are consistent with a generalized jeans s theorem ( @xcite ) if we assume that the chaotic building blocks are `` fully mixed , '' that is , that they approximate a uniform population of the accessible phase space .",
    "this appears to be the case based on visual inspection of the time - averaged chaotic trajectories .",
    "while a sudden onset of chaos can effectively destroy triaxiality in models containing a large population of regular box orbits ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , our work shows that at least the central parts of galaxies containing black holes can remain triaxial even when dominated by chaotic orbits .",
    "galaxy nuclei are typically modelled as oblate axisymmetric systems when deriving black hole masses from stellar - kinematical data ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "modelling a triaxial nucleus as axisymmetric will generally lead to biassed estimates of @xmath38 ; for instance , if an elongated bar is viewed end - on , the velocity field can mimic that produced by a black hole even in the absence of a central mass concentration ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high - resolution data on which such mass estimates are based are usually obtained from single slits , making it difficult to rule out triaxial shapes using information like that in figure 3 .",
    "axisymmetry is typically also assumed when deriving rates of interaction of stars with nuclear black holes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the triaxial models which we constructed from regular orbits were dominated by @xmath28-tubes ( table 2 ) , similar to the tube orbits that populate an oblate spheroid . the rate of capture or destruction of stars by the black hole in these models would be similar to the rates in an axisymmetric nucleus . however the dominance of chaotic orbits in our second set of solutions implies a qualitatively different sort of behavior : the `` loss cone '' of stars captured by the black hole would be refilled on a time scale determined by the frequency of near - center passages of the chaotic orbits , rather than by two - body scattering .",
