    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions is in excellent agreement with the experimental data and has explained many features of particle physics throughout the years . despite its success there are some points in the model as , for instance , the enormous range of masses between the lightest and heaviest fermions and other peculiarities that could be better explained at a deeper level assuming the introduction of new fields or symmetries .",
    "recently the atlas and cms collaborations reported the observation of a new boson with a mass @xmath2gev which is suspected to be the sm higgs boson . the current data on this boson diphoton event rate exhibit the signal strength about ( 1.5 - 2 ) larger than the one expected for the standard model higgs boson .",
    "there are already many sm extensions trying to explain this possible enhancement of the @xmath5 decay .",
    "in particular , the increase of this decay rate is natural in the context of a 3 - 3 - 1 model @xcite and its alternative version with exotic leptons@xcite , due to the presence of an extra charged vector boson and a doubly charged one as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this class of models predicts interesting new physics at tev scale @xcite and addresses some fundamental questions that can not be explained in the framework of the standard model@xcite .",
    "these models also contain a set of fundamental scalar bosons , with many parameters and clearly suffering from the problems of naturalness and hierarchy @xcite .",
    "however in refs.@xcite it was suggested that the gauge symmetry breaking in some versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model @xcite could be promoted dynamically , because at the scale of a few tevs the @xmath6 coupling constant becomes strong and the exotic quark @xmath1 that appears in the model forms a condensate breaking @xmath7 to the sm electroweak symmetry .",
    "this is a very interesting feature and peculiar to this class of models .",
    "unfortunately the sm gauge symmetry still remains intact , and the nice characteristics of the model could be missed with the introduction of a elementary scalar field in order to break the electroweak gauge symmetry , leading to an unpleasant system of composite and elementary fields responsible for the gauge symmetry breaking .    in ref.@xcite the full realization of the dynamical symmetry breaking of a @xmath8 extension of the sm @xcite was explored .",
    "this was accomplished assuming the gauge symmetry @xmath9 , where the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically by a technifermion condensate generated by the @xmath10 technicolor ( tc ) gauge group , i.e. besides the exotic @xmath1 quark condensate and respective composite scalar , we do now have another composite scalar boson formed by @xmath10 technifermions . this symmetry breaking",
    "also occurs when we exchange the @xmath10 group by the @xmath11 group , as well as when we deal with different technifermion representations @xcite .    in 3 - 3 - 1 models where the gauge symmetry breaking is promoted by elementary scalar fields ,",
    "the many parameters in the scalar potential can be variated in a large range leaving space to scape , up to now , to the lhc experimental constraints . however , in the case where the gauge symmetry breaking it totally dynamical , once we describe the possible dynamics of the theory , we may already have some limitation on the possible models .",
    "the study of possible constraints in this class of models is the main motivation of this work .",
    "we compute the effective potential for composite operators of a class of 3 - 3 - 1 models where the gauge symmetry is dynamically broken , with the main purpose of determining the composite scalar masses .",
    "if , for instance , we consider @xmath12 , we verify that it is quite difficult to generate a scalar boson mass of @xmath13 gev , assuming that it is a composite scalar that has been observed at the lhc , obeying , at the same time , the lower limit on the @xmath14 .",
    "the composite scalar system of these 3 - 3 - 1 models have a mixing related to the @xmath15 and @xmath14 mixing , which is present in the exotic @xmath1 quark self - energy .",
    "this mixing will appear in the calculation of the effective potential for composite operators @xcite , which , when minimized , supply the physical scalar masses , and it is important to know its amount because the scalar masses may be modified by this effect .",
    "there are other possible contributions to this mixing , that would appear in an extended theory necessary to explain the fermion masses , whose spectrum has no explanation in any dynamical symmetry breaking model up to now .",
    "however these corrections are expected to be small compared to the ones that we discuss here , and it will become clear that already at this level some versions of these models may be excluded by the recent lhc data .",
    "the distribution of our paper is the following : in section ii we present the main aspects of the @xmath16 models . in section iii",
    "we discuss the mixing of the neutral gauge boson system , its relation to the @xmath1 quark dynamical mass and present the self - energies that will be used in the effective action calculation .",
    "the mixing in the @xmath1 quark self - energy will be responsible by the coupling between the composite scalars ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , associated respectively with the breaking of symmetries @xmath8 and @xmath19 in the effective potential .",
    "section iv contains the calculation of the effective action and in section v we compute numerically the scalar boson masses for different tc groups .",
    "finally , in section vi we draw our conclusions .",
    "on the lines below we describe the main features of the models , which are similar to that proposed in ref.@xcite , the fermionic content has the following form & & q_3l = (    c t + b + t    ) _ l~(*1 * , * 3 * , 2/3 ) +   + & & t_r~(*1 * , * 1 * , 2/3),b_r~(*1*,*1*,-1/3 ) +   + & & t_r~ ( * 1*,*1 * , 5/3 ) & & q_l = (    c d + u + d    ) _ l~(*1 * , * 3^ * * , -1/3 ) +   + & & u_r ~ ( * 1*,*1 * , 2/3 ) , d_r~(*1 * , * 1 * , -1/3 ) +   + & & d_r~ ( * 1 * , * 1 * , -4/3 ) where @xmath20 is the family index and we represent the third quark family by @xmath21 . in these expressions",

    "moreover , we have to add the corresponding right - handed components , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the fermionic content associated with the tc sector has the form & & _",

    "the model is anomaly free if we have equal numbers of triplets and antitriplets , counting the color of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , in order to make the model anomaly free two of the three quark generations transform as @xmath39 , the third quark family and the three leptons generations transform as @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to check that all gauge anomalies cancel out in this model , in the tc sector the triangular anomaly cancels between the two generations of technifermions . in the present version of the model the technifermions are singlets of @xmath38 .",
    "as pointed out in refs.@xcite , one interesting feature of the versions@xcite of 3 - 3 - 1 models is the following relationship among the coupling constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 associated to the gauge group @xmath8 @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the electroweak mixing angle . according to the discussion presented in@xcite ,",
    "it is precisely this feature of the model that allows the gauge symmetry breaking of this version of the @xmath8 model to the sm symmetry , because at the scale of a few tevs the @xmath6 coupling constant becomes strong as we approach the peak existent in eq.([equ1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the model described in this section the exotic quark @xmath1 will form a condensate breaking @xmath8 to the electroweak gauge symmetry , while the sm gauge symmetry will be broken dynamically by a technifermion condensate .    in order to compute the effective action generated for the composite scalar bosons resulting from the two symmetry breaking stages , in the next section we discuss the @xmath1 quark self - energy , that is related to the mixing between the standard model neutral gauge boson z with the z boson .",
    "in the models that we consider here there is a mixing between the standard model neutral gauge boson z with the z boson , the mass eigenstates are@xcite & & z_1 = z- z + & & z_2 = z+ z where the mixing angle(@xmath47 ) is given by@xcite = , in this case ( @xmath48 ) represents the sm neutral boson and ( @xmath49 ) corresponds to the additional 3 - 3 - 1 heavy neutral boson .",
    "therefore , assuming this mixing we can write in the euclidean space the following linearized gap equation ( @xmath50 ) for the @xmath1 quark : @xmath51}\\frac{1}{[(p- k)^2 + m^2_{z ' } ] } + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\,\\ , a\\sin\\theta\\!\\!\\int \\ !",

    ", we have similar entities due to the @xmath58 group condensation at the scale @xmath59 , generated by a non - trivial technifermion self - energy ( @xmath60 ) . as discussed in ref.@xcite the technifermions multiplets , @xmath61 and @xmath62 described in eq.([3 ] ) , lead to the formation of composite scalar bosons ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) that are equivalents to the set of fundamental scalar fields , @xmath65 and @xmath66@xcite , so , in order to obtain a structure of the scalar potential similar the described in@xcite , we will assume that = , [ 35 ] this normalization results from the fact that @xmath67 ( as we shall describe in eq.([28 ] ) ) , and from this it is possible to verify that ^2 = ^2_1 + ^2_2 , [ 38 ] once @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , typical of the two technifermion generations of eq.([3 ] ) .",

    "[ eq341 ]    to compute the effective potential for composite operators @xcite we need to know the self - energies of the strongly interacting fermions : the @xmath1 quark and the fermions with @xmath11 charges .",
    "eq.([10 ] ) has two possible solutions , and in the program developed in refs.@xcite it was verified that the solution falling slowly with the momentum is the dominating one if suitable new interactions are assumed to be relevant at the scale of the ( uv ) cutoff . in their case",
    "the gauge boson mass integrals receive significant contributions from a very large range of loop momenta and the sm gauge boson masses @xmath72 and @xmath73 turn out to be of similar magnitude when compared to the top quark mass .",
    "this is exactly the situation that we have in the approach proposed to promote the gauge symmetry breaking of @xmath74 to the electroweak symmetry , where at the scale of a few tevs the @xmath55 coupling constant becomes strong as we approach the peak existent in eq.([equ1 ] ) . in the ref.@xcite after the numerical calculation of @xmath75 , it was found that the magnitudes of @xmath76 and @xmath75 are the same order .",

    "it is expected that confinement should be necessary to generate non - trivial fermionic self - energies @xcite , and the expression for the self - energy is the one of eq.([eq12 ] ) , as discussed at length in ref.@xcite .",

    "<S> we determine the lightest scalar boson mass for these models from an effective action for composite operators , assuming details about the dynamics of the strong interaction theories . comparing the value of this mass with the atlas and cms observation of a new boson with a mass @xmath2gev and considering the lower bound determined by the lhc collaborations on the heavy neutral gauge boson @xmath3 present in these models </S>",
