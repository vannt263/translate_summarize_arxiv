    "high - amplitude sub - larmor - scale electromagnetic turbulence is ubiquitous in high - energy density environments , such as laboratory plasmas produced by high - intensity lasers , e.g. , national ignition facility , omega , hercules , trident , and others @xcite , and in astrophysical and space plasmas , e.g. , at high - mach - number collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized plasmas @xcite , upstream regions of quasi - parallel shocks @xcite , sites of magnetic reconnection @xcite and others .",
    "studies of plasmas and turbulence in these environments are important for fusion energy sciences and the inertial confinement concept @xcite , in particular , as well as to numerous astrophysical systems such as gamma - ray bursts @xcite , supernovae blast waves @xcite , jets of quasars and active galactic nuclei @xcite , shocks in the interplanetary medium @xcite , solar flares @xcite and many more",
    ". such turbulence can be of various origin and thus have rather different properties , from being purely magnetic ( weibel ) turbulence @xcite , to various types of electromagnetic turbulence ( for example , whistler wave turbulence or turbulence produced by filamentation / mixed mode instability ) , to purely electrostatic langmuir turbulence @xcite .    despite substantial differences , these turbulences share one thing in common : the electromagnetic fields vary on scales much smaller than the characteristic curvature radius of the particles paths ( i.e. , the larmor radius in most cases ) , which is typically of the order of the plasma inertial length ( skin depth ) , so that the particle orbits are never a well - defined larmor circle . if the electromagnetic fields are random , which is usually the case of turbulence because of the random phases of fluctuations , their paths diffusively diverge due to pitch - angle diffusion .",
    "radiation simultaneously produced by these particles is neither cyclotron nor synchrotron ( for non - relativistic or relativistic particles , respectively ) but , instead , carries information about the spectrum of turbulent fluctuations . in this paper",
    "we explore the relation of the transport of relativistic particles in isotropic three - dimensional magnetic turbulence and the radiation spectra simultaneously produced by these particles .",
    "we have found that in the small - angle - deflection regime , the radiation spectrum agrees with the jitter radiation prediction @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrate that the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient is directly related to and can readily be deduced from spectra of the emitted radiation .",
    "this provides a unique way to remotely diagnose high - energy - density plasmas , both in laboratory experiments and in astrophysical systems .",
    "this can be particular interest , for example , for the physics of collisionless shocks and fermi particle acceleration in them , because the latter is intimately related to the diffusion coefficient in the upstream and downstream regions of such shocks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s : analytic ] presents the analytic theory .",
    "sections [ s : model ] and [ s : results ] describe the numerical techniques employed and the obtained simulation results .",
    "section [ s : concl ] is the conclusions .",
    "let us consider a relativistic electron moving through a non - uniform , inhomogeneous , random , small - scale magnetic field ( and we assume that this magnetic micro - turbulence is statistically homogeneous and isotropic ) . because of the random lorentz force on the electron , it s acceleration and velocity vectors vary stochastically , leading to a random ( diffusive ) trajectory .",
    "we define the field turbulence to be `` small - scale '' when the electron s larmor radius , @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the electron s lorentz factor , @xmath2 is the dimensionless particle velocity , @xmath3 is the electron mass , @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 is the electric charge , and @xmath6 is the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the electron s velocity vector ) is greater than , or comparable to , the characteristic correlation scale of the magnetic field , @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "hereafter , we consider ultra - relativistic particles only , @xmath9 .    for small deflections ,",
    "the deflection angle of the velocity ( with respect to the particle s initial direction of motion ) is approximately the ratio of the change in the electron s transverse momentum to its initial momentum .",
    "the former is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the transverse lorentz force , and @xmath12 is the transit time , which is the time required to traverse the the scale of the field s inhomogeneity , i.e. , the field correlation length , @xmath7 . for an ultra - relativistic particle ( whose lorentz factor is @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 . the particle s total",
    "momentum is , likewise , @xmath15 .",
    "the change in the transverse momentum is thus , @xmath16 .",
    "an ultra - relativistic electron will only experience small deviations to its original path ; consequently , the deflection angle over the field correlation length will be @xmath17 .",
    "the subsequent deflection will be in a random direction , because the field is uncorrelated over the scales greater than @xmath7 , hence the particle motion is diffusive . as for any diffusive process ,",
    "the mean squared pitch angle grows linearly with time as @xmath18 the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient is , by definition , the ratio of the square of the deflection angle in a coherent patch to the transit time over this patch , that is @xmath19 where an average square magnetic field , @xmath20 has been substituted for @xmath21 .",
    "note that the diffusion coefficient depends on both statistical properties of the magnetic field , namely its strength and the typical correlation scale .",
    "next , the diffusing particle experiences accelerations and , hence , produces radiation . the radiation from an ultra - relativistic charge is beamed in a cone with a narrow angle of @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio of the particle deflection angle to the beaming angle is @xcite : @xmath23 where we used that @xmath24 , as before and the characteristic wavenumber of the turbulence , i.e. , @xmath25 at which @xmath26 has the maximum , is @xmath27 .",
    "note however that the jitter parameter is scale - dependent , therefore at each scale @xmath25 , the jitter parameter is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the rms field at scale @xmath25 , i.e. , it is average over a range of scales from @xmath25 to @xmath30 with @xmath31 , that is @xmath32 the radiation spectrum and diffusion may , generally , be sensitive to this @xmath25-local value @xmath33 , though the overall spectrum and diffusion are indeed determined by its averaged value , @xmath34",
    ". one important conclusion can readily be made from comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ daa ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "the jitter parameter and the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient are directly related as @xmath35    -0.1 in    there are several regimes of interest .",
    "first , @xmath36 regime corresponds to the classical synchrotron radiation regime : the particle orbit is a circle in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field and the field itself is homogeneous .",
    "second , the regime with @xmath37 is very similar to synchrotron , but the particle s guiding center is slowly drifting in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the produced spectrum is well represented by the synchrotron spectrum in a weakly inhomogeneous magnetic field and it slowly evolves in time due to particle diffusion through regions with different field strength .",
    "this regime can be referred to as the diffusive synchrotron regime .",
    "third , when @xmath38 , the particle does not complete it s larmor orbit because the @xmath39-field varies on a shorter scale . in this case , an onlooking observer would see radiation from only short intervals of the particle s trajectory ( i.e. , whenever the trajectory is near the line - of - sight ) , as in synchrotron , but these intervals are randomly distributed .",
    "this is the case of the large - angle jitter regime .",
    "the radiation is similar to synchrotron radiation near the spectral peak and above , but differ significantly from it at lower frequencies , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . finally ,",
    "if @xmath40 , the particle s deviations are extremely small compared to its beaming angle , so the radiation seen by an observer is produced over a large number of incoherent patches of the @xmath39-field , i.e. , almost throughout the entire trajectory of the particle @xcite , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] .",
    "thus , the resulting radiation markedly differs from synchrotron radiation , although the total radiated power of radiation , @xmath41 , produced by a particle in all these regimes , e.g. , jitter and synchrotron , are identical : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the classical electron radius and @xmath44 is the characteristic synchrotron frequency of radiation in a uniform or weakly inhomogeneous ( on the larmor scale ) magnetic field .",
    "radiation produced in the small - angle jitter regime , @xmath40 , is the most sensitive to and provides the most information on the turbulence properties , hence , we mostly consider this regime in our paper",
    ". the characteristic frequency of radiation can be estimated by considering the virtual photon approximation .",
    "the correlation scale @xmath45 , as seen in the electron s rest frame , is related to @xmath7 in the lab frame by the lorentz transformation ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) .",
    "the electron s transverse acceleration occurs over the length scale of @xmath7 , which corresponds to a characteristic time scale , in the electron s frame , of @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the radiation emitted by the electron has a characteristic frequency , in the electron s rest frame , of @xmath48 .",
    "transforming back to the lab frame picks up another factor of @xmath1 from the lorentz transformation , giving the characteristic frequency of @xmath49 , or : @xmath50 the spectral power at the characteristic ( spectral break ) frequency is @xmath51 note that this equation allows one to determine the jitter parameter directly from spectral observations : @xmath52^{1/2}. \\label{delta - pomegaj}\\ ] ] from eqs .",
    "( [ daa - delta ] ) , ( [ omegaj ] ) one obtains the relation between the spectral break of radiation and the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient : @xmath53 one can also relate the diffusion coefficient to the spectral power at the break frequency from eq .",
    "( [ pomegaj ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath54 we emphasize that @xmath55 is , thus , a directly measurable quantity because it solely depends on the radiation spectral power at the break frequency , @xmath56 , and the lorenz factor , @xmath1 , of the radiation - emitting electrons .",
    "thus , radiative diagnostics should be a very useful technique to study laboratory plasmas and explore plasma conditions in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "in general , turbulence has a range of scales rather than a single scale @xmath57 .",
    "we explore how spectral and transport properties are modified in this more realistic case . in the analysis",
    ", we assume the isotropic three - dimensional magnetic turbulence with a power law turbulent spectrum : @xmath58 if @xmath59 and zero otherwise . here",
    "@xmath60 is the spatial fourier transform of the magnetic field , @xmath61 is the wave vector , and index @xmath62 is a positive number .",
    "notice that we consider a static isotropic turbulence , hence the field distribution is independent of time and the wave vector direction .",
    "note that such magnetic turbulence is a natural outcome of the non - linear weibel / filamentation instability , which occurs at relativistic collisionless shocks and in laser - produced plasmas .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that monoenergetic relativistic electrons in such turbulence produce flat angle - averaged spectra below the spectral ( jitter ) break and power - law spectra above the break , that is @xmath63 where the spectral ( jitter ) break is defined in this case as @xmath64 because the field @xmath65 at @xmath66 has the most power ( for @xmath67 ) and , hence , @xmath66 plays the role of @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ omegaj ] ) .",
    "similarly , the high - frequency break is @xmath68 thus , by observing the radiation spectrum , one can probe the structure of the magnetic turbulence that generates it . note that the angle - averaged single electron spectra are equivalent to the ensemble - averaged spectra for isotropic particle distribution functions .",
    "we will use the latter in our numerical study .",
    "our goal is to explore , via simulations of particle dynamics in magnetic turbulence , the diffusive and radiative properties of plasmas and how they are related .",
    "we perform our simulations from first - principles .",
    "we use a 3d simulation box with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "relativistic electrons are test particles moving in the preset magnetic fields but do not interact with each other , nor do they induce any fields .",
    "radiative energy losses are considered negligible compared to the energies of individual particles , hence neglected .",
    "motion of each electron is , thus , solely determined by the lorentz force equation given by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "note that this lorentz force conserves particle s energy , therefore the magnitude of the velocity is constant in time and only the direction is changing .",
    "the simulation can be divided into two principle stages ( see ref @xcite for a detailed description of the numerical implementation ) .",
    "first , the turbulent magnetic field is generated from a given spectral distribution in fourier space .",
    "this field is created on a lattice that is then interpolated , so that a  continuous \" field is represented .",
    "the interpolation was implemented by way of divergenceless matrix - valued radial basis functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for a discussion ) .",
    "this method begins with a radial function  in our case , one of the simplest , @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is a scaling factor , and @xmath73 ) .",
    "then , a set of divergence - free matrix - valued radial basis functions is obtained from the transformation @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the second - order , @xmath76-matrix differential operator and @xmath77 is the @xmath76 identity matrix . these interpolants were applied to the interior of each lattice  cube \" ( i.e.  the space between a single lattice point and the five immediately adjacent points ) .",
    "the second stage in our model then involves the numerical solution of the equation of motion for each particle , from which @xmath78 and the radiation spectra are obtained .",
    "we will first turn our attention to the generation of the magnetic field .",
    "generation of the magnetic field distribution is more convenient in fourier space for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is simpler to specify a particular spectral distribution in fourier space directly , rather than attempting to find a field in real space that would fit the chosen spectral distribution .",
    "secondly , any physically realizable field should satisfy maxwell s equations , thus its divergence must be zero . producing a divergenceless field in fourier space is far simpler than generating one in real space .",
    "this is because gauss law , @xmath79 , is an algebraic equation in fourier space , @xmath80 , for each fourier component , @xmath81 , corresponding to the wave vector @xmath82 .",
    "although our code can handle a wide variety of magnetic spectral distributions , this study is limited to the case of isotropic magnetic turbulence , described in eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) , and we have left consideration of more sophisticated models for the future .",
    "the next stage in the simulation starts with the numerical solution of the equation of motion , eq .",
    "( [ dvdt ] ) .",
    "this was done via a fixed step 4@xmath83-order runge - kutta - nystrm method . with all the particle positions , velocities , and accelerations calculated",
    ", the radiation spectrum is obtained from the equation @xcite @xmath84}{(1 - \\hat{\\bf n}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol\\beta})^2 } e^{i\\omega\\left(t - \\hat{\\bf n}\\cdot { \\bf r}(t)/c \\right)}\\ , \\mathrm{d } t \\right|^2 , \\label{lw}\\ ] ] which represents the radiative spectral energy , @xmath85 per unit frequency , @xmath86 , and per unit solid angle , @xmath87 . in this equation @xmath88",
    "is the particle s position at the retarded time @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the unit vector pointing from @xmath88 to the observer and @xmath91 .",
    "there is some freedom in the calculation of the total radiation spectrum",
    ". one can add the spectra coherently ( i.e. , by taking the fourier transform of the  summed over \" radiation fields of each particle ) . in this case",
    ", only a single integration would be needed .",
    "alternatively , we can add the spectra incoherently ( i.e. , by integrating each particle s radiation field separately , and then summing the results of each integration ) .",
    "both approaches result in the same spectra , but those obtained in the former approach are noisier for the same number of simulation particles .",
    "hence we use the second approach in our study .",
    "our code was tested in various set - ups .",
    "in one , we considered motion of a single relativistic particle in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "figure [ synch ] shows the obtained radiation spectrum and the corresponding theoretical synchrotron spectrum . here , the blue curve represents the numerically resolved synchrotron harmonics ( which are integer multiples of the gyrofrequency , @xmath92 ) .",
    "we see excellent agreement with the analytical result , indicated in red .",
    "we also verified that motion of a particle in small - scale random magnetic fields results in pitch - angle diffusion and the particle orbit is chaotic .",
    "the chaotic nature inherent in the particle motion is illustrated in figure [ traj ] . here",
    ", 50 monoenergetic ( @xmath93 ) particles are sent out from an origin in random directions .",
    "the variability in the particle motion is seen after shortly leaving the origin .",
    "the diffusive nature of the particle motion is evident from figure [ v_space ] and figure [ diff_slope ] . in figure",
    "[ v_space ] , the velocity space of a single relativistic particle ( @xmath94 ) is plotted over a very large simulation time . notice that the particle velocity is confined to a sphere ( i.e. ,  @xmath1 is constant ) , and that the velocity vector diffusively visits various directions in the course of the particle s motion . in figure",
    "[ diff_slope ] , the average square pitch - angle , @xmath78 is plotted versus @xmath89 for three different cases .",
    "the linear dependence is indicative of pitch - angle diffusion , cf .",
    "( [ diff_def ] ) . in all three cases , @xmath95 .",
    "note that the diffusion approximation of these particles motion is accurate so long as @xmath96 .",
    "finally , we verified the numerical convergence of the results by changing the size of the simulation box and the total number of simulation particles .",
    "because of vastly different computational requirements in various cases , however , we were sometimes forced to use a smaller number of particles than in other scientific runs .",
    "this introduced more noise in some spectra presented below .",
    "in section [ s : analytic ] we made a number of theoretical predictions concerning radiation and transport properties of plasmas with small - scale turbulent magnetic fields . here",
    "we check these results with numerical simulations and then further explore how radiation spectra depend on underlying magnetic field distributions .    first of all , we explore how the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient depends on various parameters , cf .",
    "( [ daa ] ) , namely the particle s lorentz factor , @xmath1 , the magnetic field strength @xmath20 and the jitter parameter @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ diff_gamma ] shows the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath55 .",
    "close agreement between the theoretical and numerical diffusion coefficients with varying lorentz factor is evident .",
    "next , @xmath55 depends on two additional parameters , namely @xmath66 and @xmath20 . instead of plotting @xmath55 vs. @xmath66 directly , we chose to plot the diffusion coefficient vs. the frequency ( figure [ diff_peak ] ) of @xmath97  which is given in eq .",
    "( [ omegaj ] )  in the radiation spectrum .",
    "figure [ diff_peak ] represents cases with different values of @xmath66 s , @xmath98 s , @xmath99 s , @xmath100 s , @xmath20 s , and @xmath1 s , which is why the points show large spread ( the parameters used for each data point are listed in table [ parameter_table ] ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 on the magnetic field strength , @xmath20 , is illustrated in figure [ diff_b ] , which agrees with the prediction given by eq .",
    "( [ daa ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the apparent difference between the theoretical and numerical diffusion coefficients in these plots is due to the approximate nature of our theoretical analysis in section [ s : analytic ] .",
    "we now present radiation spectra and demonstrate how they are related to the parameters of the turbulent magnetic field . in all runs , we specify the field strength with the jitter parameter , given by eq .",

    "<S> the relation of particle transport of relativistic particles in plasmas with high - amplitude isotropic sub - larmor - scale magnetic turbulence to the spectra of radiation simultaneously produced by these particles is investigated both analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that in the asymptotic regime of very small particle deflections the pitch angle diffusion coefficient is directly related to the spectrum of the emitted radiation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this spectrum provides much information about the statistical properties of the underlying magnetic turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from small- to large - scale jitter to synchrotron radiation regimes as a function of turbulence properties has also been explored . </S>",
    "<S> these results can readily be used to diagnose laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . </S>"
