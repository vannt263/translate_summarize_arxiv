    "while penrose has proposed the so - called cosmic censorship conjecture@xcite , several spacetimes admitting naked singularity formation even in gravitational collapse of physically reasonable matter from regular initial data have been found over the past three decades ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the examples well - studied are spherically symmetric collapses of an inhomogeneous dust ball@xcite , and a self - similar isothermal gas@xcite",
    ". a shell - focusing naked singularity can appear at the center in a wide range of the initial data set .",
    "it is an important problem to understand peculiar physical phenomena associated with naked singularity formation .",
    "time evolution of various perturbations in black hole geometry have been extensively studied , and the late - time behaviors such as quasi - normal ringings and power - law tails have been clarified . such perturbation analysis in background geometry involving",
    "a naked singularity will be interesting not only in relation to the possible instability of the cauchy horizon but also in terms of revealing some typical patterns of time evolution observable as a precursor of naked singularity formation .",
    "the first step to approach this problem will be to consider spherically symmetric self - similar models of gravitational collapse as background spacetime . because all dimensionless components of the background metric depend only on the one self - similar variable @xmath0 , the perturbation analysis becomes mathematically simpler .",
    "in addition , there exist numerical simulations@xcite showing that the geometrical structure and the fluid motion at late stages in general non - self - similar collapse of an isothermal gas can be well described by the general relativistic version@xcite of the larson - penston self - similar solution .",
    "we can expect self - similar solutions to be a realistic model of gravitational collapse .",
    "several works have been devoted to the analysis of perturbations generated in spherically symmetric self - similar collapse with naked singularity formation .",
    "for example , using quantum theory of particle production in curved spacetime , it has been shown that the energy flux of the semiclassical radiation diverges on the cauchy horizon according to inverse square power - law of the retarded time@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "considering classical perturbations of a massless scalar field , nolan and waters@xcite have claimed that the energy flux of scalar perturbations remains finite even at the cauchy horizon .",
    "their analysis is based on the behavior of perturbations written by @xmath1 with the advanced null coordinate @xmath2 and a complex parameter @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we pursue the classical analysis more extensively , by using the green s function method .",
    "though we use a standard fourier decomposition of the green s function by the function @xmath4 ( in an analogous way to the mellin transformation in @xcite ) , we reveal time evolution of perturbations by integrating the fourier components with respect to the spectral parameter @xmath5 , which will allow us to find new features missed in @xcite .    further we focus our investigation on electromagnetic perturbations generated by any given axisymmetric and circular current distribution in collapsing matter .",
    "of course we must assume that the existence of the source current does not disturb the background self - similar metric .",
    "this special choice of a test field is partly motivated by an astrophysical interest related to highly energetic phenomena such as @xmath6-ray bursts ( for example , see @xcite for electromagnetic radiation in a process of black hole formation ) . in addition , the mathematical setup of the green s function method for electromagnetic perturbations becomes quite simpler in comparison with gravitational perturbations .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to mention that the green s function method developed in the following sections does not essentially rely on a special property of electromagnetic fields .",
    "the application to scalar and gravitational perturbations will be straightforward .    in this paper we are mainly concerned with time variation of the outgoing energy flux ( namely , the poynting flux ) observed at the future null infinity . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : decomposition ] . a characteristic power - law behavior ( accompanied with or without an oscillatory behavior ) of the outgoing energy flux as a function of the retarded time",
