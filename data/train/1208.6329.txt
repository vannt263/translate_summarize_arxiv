    "spicules , mottles , and fibrils have long been studied as the principal component of the magnetized solar chromosphere .",
    "the review by @xcite on spicules at the limb and more recent work on mottles and fibrils on the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all emphasize the crucial role of these features in the mass and energy balance of the solar chromosphere .",
    "the relationship between spicules and similar features on disk has not been clearly established , largely because of the confusion resulting from projection as well as their fine structure and fast dynamics .",
    "@xcite argue that at least two species of spicules exist .",
    "both are tied intrinsically to magnetic field , but are different in their dynamics .",
    "the traditional `` type - i '' spicules exhibit slower evolution ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) and up - and - down motions with velocities on the order of @xmath3 .",
    "the `` type - ii '' spicules , first identified as `` straws '' in near - limb  images from the dutch open telescope by @xcite , show much shorter lifetimes ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) , faster velocities ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) , and often disappear over their whole length within a few seconds .",
    "further studies of type - ii spicules have revealed that they are associated with alfvnic waves @xcite .",
    "while `` straws '' or type - ii spicules are clearly evident at or near the limb , they are not so readily identified on the disk .",
    "their faint , tenuous appearance makes them hard to discern against the background . a search for disk counterparts by @xcite and a more detailed study by @xcite revealed the existence of `` rapid blueshift excursions '' ( rbes ) in the  and  ir lines that exhibit similar dynamics to type - ii spicules and fit well with the finding by @xcite and @xcite that type - ii spicules are possibly connected to the transition region and the corona through the blue - wing emission excess found in euv lines by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correspondence of rbes and type - ii spicules seems well - established @xcite .",
    "however , type - ii spicules have been exclusively identified from hinode images , and rbes have only been identified in ground - based data from narrowband imaging instruments , so a direct identification of the on - disk counterpart of type - ii spicules has yet to be presented . in this letter ,",
    "i identify a weak haze around the magnetic network using hinode data that i identify as a candidate for the on - disk manifestation of type - ii spicules .",
    "i employ observations from the solar optical telescope ( sot , * ? ? ?",

    "the first sequence was taken on 19  april 2007 between 15:00 and 17:50  ut .",
    "it contains g - band and  image sequences and a map by the _ hinode _",
    "spectropolarimeter ( sp ) , both at the highest spatial resolution the instrument is capable of .",
    "it covers an area of mostly quiet sun at disk center .",
    "a small ephemeral region is present within the field of view during the sequence .",
    "it was captured in the sp scan around 15:45  ut .",
    "the second sequence was taken on 19  february 2007 between 00:15 and 6:01  ut .",
    "this observation consists of a  image sequence with @xmath8 binning and an sp map at full resolution at the east limb .",
    "i processed the observations with the standard solarsoft ` fg_prep ` and ` sp_prep ` pipelines .",
    "in addition , the sp observations were also processed with the milne - eddington inversion code merlin @xcite to derive physical quantities such as field strength , filling factor , field azimuth , etc .",
    "@xcite found that such milne - eddington inversions are generally accurate in the case of sp observations for field strengths greater than @xmath9 .",
    "next , the sp observations were warped according to the model of @xcite to align them with the bfi observations . while the resulting alignment is already very good , i improved it for the 19  april 2007 data set by adjusting the parameters of the model in order to maximize the correlation between the sp  continuum intensity and a g - band image interpolated in time at each spatial location to match the scanning of sp ( henceforth referred to as a `` composite image '' ) using a cubic convolution method @xcite .",
    "then , i computed the plate scale difference and offset between the g - band and  images by optimizing the correlation between a composite  image and the  @xmath0 line core intensity .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is @xmath10 for the image pair ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_20070419 ] ) . the g - band and sp observations",
    "were lastly resampled to match .",
    "visual inspection shows that the alignment between the data sets is very good . to derive a quantitative measure of the quality of the alignment",
    ", i randomly chose 100 @xmath11 sub - fields and calculated the rigid offset between the  and  line core intensities .",
    "i find an offset of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the 19  february 2007 data set is more difficult to align as it does not include g - band filtergrams .",
    "the  and  line core diagnostics exhibit different center - to - limb variation that makes them difficult to compare directly at the limb .",
    "the parameters of the fit to the 19  april 2007 data set were used , but a new rigid alignment was calculated based on a subfield in the top - right corner of the field of view .",
    "the correlation coefficient on the subfield is @xmath14 , much lower than for the 19  april 2007 data .",
    "however , visual inspection , e.g. , of  intensity and field concentrations from the  inversions , shows that the co - alignment is excellent .",
    "figure  [ fig : data_20070419 ] shows the  composite image from bfi and  @xmath0 line core from sp side - by - side .",
    "the  core image shows the same scene as the .",
    "there is excellent correspondence between the  and the  core images ( @xmath10 , and see fig .",
    "[ fig : scat ] ) .",
    "however , the tenuous emission that surrounds the network in the  image is absent in the  image .",
    "the region of emerging flux around ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) shows this network haze most clearly , but it is also faintly visible around network vertices , e.g. , at ( @xmath17,@xmath17 ) .",
    "the third panel shows a `` difference image '' , in which the  intensity is subtracted from the  core intensity .",
    "the  core intensity was scaled linearly in order to match the  intensity on pixels that are between @xmath18 and @xmath19 removed from areas of vertical flux greater than @xmath20 ( indicated by orange contours in the rightmost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : data_20070419 ] ) .",
    "the difference image shows a clear excess of  emission around the emerging flux region ( black areas indicated by arrows around ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) ) .",
    "a more diffuse area of  brightness excess surrounds the network vertex at ( @xmath17,@xmath17 ) .",
    "flux concentrations themselves , on the other hand , are brighter in the  core .",

    "[ fig : haze ] i plot the intensity as a function of distance from regions with vertical flux greater than @xmath20 .",
    "the  core was scaled in the same way as in the difference image in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_20070419 ] .",
    "the network haze is evident as a brightness excess in the  intensity of several percent over the intensity in the  core at a distance between @xmath25 and @xmath17 from areas of strong vertical flux ( @xmath26 of all pixels ) .",
    "the photometric noise on the images is small and can be estimated with the solarsoft ` fg_noise ` function .",
    "i find about @xmath27 for both the  images as well as the  core composite image .",
    "for the latter , this number is consistent with the typical estimate of @xmath28 polarimetric signal - to - noise for an sp `` normal map '' .",
    "in addition , the curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : haze ] average over several thousand samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : scat ] shows a scatterplot of  versus  core intensities for both all pixels and those pixels between @xmath29 and @xmath17 removed from strong vertical magnetic flux .",
    "the two clouds are homomorphic , indicating that the pixels close to strong vertical magnetic flux do not constitute a distinct population .",
    "however , the difference image shows that most of the excess is concentrated around the emerging flux region , and closer inspection shows that the bulge in the scatterplot around @xmath30 is associated with these pixels .",
    "this shows that network haze is exhibited by pixels with average intensity in the sot  passband but slightly below average intensity in the  core .",
    "figure  [ fig : data_20070219 ] shows the comparison between  and  core intensity at the limb using the data set from 19  february 2007 . in this case , sot only observed  with the bfi and  with the sp .",
    "a radial filter was applied to both the  and  data to scale the brightness of the off - limb structures by a factor of @xmath31 . both type - i and type - ii spicules",
    "are visible in  as a thick forest above the limb that reaches to @xmath17 height .",
    "the  core intensity image shows very faint emission up to about @xmath25 above the limb that was studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "there are three contributions to  network brightness in observations with relatively broad filter passbands such as these that cause an excess over the internetwork brightness . because the filter is broad compared to the core of the  line the majority of the intensity in these observations is photospheric sampled by the line wings .",
    "the classic wilson depression allows emission to escape from deeper and hotter layers and hence the brightness of the wings is increased .",
    "calculations of the response function by @xcite show that the passband also samples higher layers .",
    "heating in the magnetic network in the high photosphere and low chromosphere thus adds to the network brightness excess .",
    "finally , there is a contribution from chromospheric structures in the core of the  line .    the core of the  line samples the same atmospheric layers as the hinode  passband as is evidenced by the exceedingly high correlation coefficient between the two diagnostics . as a result ,",
    "the first two sources of brightness excess in the  images will also contribute in the same way to the excess of brightness in the network as seen in the core of the  line .",
    "the third source , however , is mostly absent in the  observations because of the lack of optical thickness of spicules in that line . a weak emission signal extending less than @xmath25 above the limb",
    "was recently identified by @xcite .",
    "they analyze the emission and conclude that the polarization signature is most likely created by scattering and that it is depolarized through the hanle effect by a magnetic field of several gauss .",
    "limb observations show that the distinct  spicule forest is not present in the  core intensity .",
    "this , and the correspondence of the length of the spicules in  to the extent of the on - disk network haze ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : haze ] ) , suggests that the haze is caused by spicules .",
    "the persistence of some arch - like structures on the limb is noteworthy . the chromospheric magnetic field , stable on timescales longer than a few minutes , is apparently traced out by spicules preferentially along some field lines .",
    "type - i spicules have been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "mottles and fibrils , on the other hand , have not been identified in  diagnostics .",
    "they have been studied in chromospheric observations in lines such as  and the ir  triplet .",
    "it stands to reason that they must have some signature also in the  line , but they probably appear as absorption features that would be difficult to detect against the background of reversed granulation .",
    "it is more likely that the network haze is the on - disk counterpart of type - ii spicules .",
    "type - ii spicules have been detected on disk as emission `` straws '' by @xcite .",
    "they can not be individually identified in these  images ( neither in the composite images shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : data_20070419 ] and  [ fig : data_20070219 ] nor in the individual images of which they are made up ) .",
    "this can be attributed to several factors .",
    "first , the fast dynamics of the very slender type - ii spicules are not captured in these  images because they are resampled in time to match the slow scanning of the sp slit .",
    "furthermore , the wide sot  bandpass of @xmath32 samples too much light in the wings of the line for the type - ii spicules to show up with high contrast in disk observations .",
    "it is possible to observe type - ii spicules directly on the limb with sot because there is no bright background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even near the limb @xcite , though in both cases there is confusion from integration along the line of sight . in sot",
    "filtergrams , type - ii spicules would be very faint on disk , yet must have some emission signature .",
    "rbes , on the other hand , appear in absorption against the photosphere in  because that line has no opacity in the region of the atmosphere where reversed granulation is formed .",
    "the  intensity excess is strongest in the region of emerging flux round ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) .",
    "it is however also present and faintly visible around other areas of concentrated flux , e.g. , the network vertex at ( @xmath29,@xmath17 ) .",
    "the average intensity as a function of distance to strong flux concentrations still shows excess  emission between @xmath25 and @xmath17 even if the emerging flux region is excluded from the analysis .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite who studied rbes and found they are ubiquitous but concentrated around regions of enhanced magnetic field . from simple tests",
    "it appears that the results presented here are robust with respect to the choice of threshold value for the selection of concentrations of strong vertical flux .",
    "if the region of emerging flux is excluded , the  intensity shows an excess over the  intensity for distances less than @xmath25 from strong vertical flux , consistent with the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_20070419 ] that the flux concentrations themselves are bright in the difference image .",
    "the simulations by @xcite also provide evidence to support the identification of the haze with type - ii spicules . they find structures in their realistic 3d mhd simulations that resemble type - ii spicules in predominantly unipolar regions of emerging flux . the difference image in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_20070419 ] shows that the network haze is strongest in the two patches of predominantly unipolar flux of opposite polarity in the region of enhanced activity around ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) and ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) , in agreement with the simulations .",
    "the objects in the simulation are produced as a result of deflection of plasma that is pushed against a `` wall '' of low-@xmath37 plasma by a strong lorentz force .",
    "the regions of emerging flux exhibit the strong gradients in the magnetic field in both their simulation and these observations , which is required for the mechanism to work effectively .",
    "ideally , for comparison with these simulations one would not only determine the locations of network haze but also the history of flows in these areas through feature tracking on a sequence of magnetograms .",
    "the observations used here unfortunately did not include such a sequence .",
    "because of the relatively broad sot  filter , the wings of the line dominate the contribution to the reversed granulation intensity . if a diagnostic can be found that samples similar structures as the  wing but that lacks opacity in chromospheric structures , it may be possible to increase the contrast of spicules on disk through subtraction . such a procedure",
    "has previously been used for the identification of magnetic bright points @xcite .",
    "the  line core would appear to be a suitable candidate .",
    "however , the filter bandwidth must be narrow",
    ". the sp samples the  line very cleanly with a spectral resolution of @xmath38 sampled with @xmath39 pixels . the difference image in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_20070219 ] suffers from the spatial resolution of the sp data as well as the resampling of the  data in time to match slit scanning .",
    "summarizing , there is evidence to suggest that the network haze in the  images is the on - disk manifestation of some class spicules .",
    "type - ii spicules are the likely candidate , since they are known to appear in emission in on - disk  images from other other telescopes @xcite , and the region around which is appears most clearly is where type - ii spicules are expected to be produced based on simulations @xcite .            , r. , lites , b. , de wijn , a.  g. , & elmore , d. 2009 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
