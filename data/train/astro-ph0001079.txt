    "study of isotopic ratios on carbon inclusions in ferric salt deposits in greenland shows that life existed on earth before @xmath2 billion years ( mojzsis et al . 1996 ; holland 1997 ; schidlowski 1993 ) or possibly even before @xmath3 billion years ( mukhin & gerasimov 1993 ) . on the other hand , data from isotope systematics",
    "show that the earth is between @xmath4 to @xmath5 billion years old ( faure 1986 ) .",
    "the time available for life to develop on the earth from scratch is possibly around @xmath6 billion years which is very short ( crick & orgel 1973 ) .",
    "one of the ways the formation of life on earth could be assisted if the building blocks of life , namely , amino acids and at least some of the bases of dna could be produced well before the planetary formation , presumably during chemical evolution of molecular clouds . whereas extensive work is present in the literature to study evolution of some of the organic and inorganic molecules ,",
    "no work is reported so far which study the formation of bio - molecules or pre - biotic molecules such as amino acids , sugars , dna , rna etc .",
    "bases of dna such as adenine ( @xmath7 ) can be produced by successive addition of @xmath8 molecules in four steps ( volkenshtein , 1983 ) . in the present _ letter",
    "_ we perform a hydrodynamic simulation and followed chemical evolution during the molecular cloud collapse and show that a significant amount of adenine ( with mass fraction @xmath9 ) could be produced .",
    "this indicates that planets and comets could have formed with contaminations of pre - biotic molecules .",
    "if correct , this may resolve a long - standing problem of origin of lives on earth .",
    "we take the umist database ( millar , farquhar & willacy 1997 ; hereafter referred to as mfw97 ) as our basis of chemical reactants and reactions , but added several new reactions such as synthesis of amino acids ( alanine and glycine ) , hydroxy - acids ( glycolic and lactic acids ) , dna base ( adenine , see , volkenshtein 1983 ) , urea synthesis etc .",
    "these new reactions make the total number of species to be @xmath0 . the rate co - efficients of these additional reactions are difficult to find , especially in the environs of a molecular cloud . to use umist database , the rate constant for a two body reaction",
    "is written as ( mfw97 ) , @xmath10 where , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants and @xmath14 is the temperature .",
    "amino acid synthesis rate was estimated from fig .",
    "8 of schulte & shock ( 1995 ) .",
    "urea synthesis rate is kept comparable to the rates given in umist table .",
    "the rate constants were taken to be @xmath15 , @xmath16 for each two - body reactions .",
    "the rate constants for adenine synthesis was chosen to be similar to other two body reactions [ @xmath17 @xmath16 for each hcn addition in the chain @xmath18 ( adenine ) ] .",
    "this should provide a sufficiently good estimate for the final abundance of these pre - biotic molecules .",
    "initial composition of the cloud before the simulation begins is kept to be the same as in mfw97 , and formation of @xmath19 is included using the grain - surface reaction with rates as in mfw97 .",
    "the initial _ mass fractions _ are taken to be the same as in mfw97 ( but converted to mass fractions ) , i.e. , h : he : c : n : o : na : mg : si : p : s : cl : fe = @xmath20:@xmath21:@xmath22:@xmath23:@xmath24:@xmath25 : @xmath26:@xmath27:@xmath28:@xmath29:@xmath30:@xmath31 .",
    "we use simple molecular cloud model with generic initial conditions : initial size of the molecular cloud @xmath32 cm , average temperature of the cloud @xmath33k , and angular velocity of the cloud @xmath34 rad s@xmath35 . the sound speed becomes @xmath36 cm s@xmath35 and corresponding initial density ( shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) is @xmath37 g @xmath38 and accretion rate is @xmath39 g s@xmath35 . here , @xmath40 mean molecular weight , @xmath41 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , and @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant . in the isothermal phase of the cloud collapse , density @xmath43 ( chandrasekhar 1939 ) and the velocity is constant . when opacity becomes high enough to trap radiations ( say , at @xmath44 ) , the cloud collapses adiabatically with @xmath45 . in presence of rotation , centrifugal barrier forms at @xmath46 ,",
    "where centrifugal force balances gravity .",
    "density falls off as @xmath47 in this region ( hartmann , 1998 ) . following shu , adams & lizano ( 1987 ) , we compute the density , temperature and velocity distribution inside the cloud and follow the chemical evolution at the same time . with density chosen as above",
    ", the initial constant velocity of infall becomes @xmath48 cm s@xmath35 and below @xmath46 velocity @xmath49 to preserve the accretion rate in a disk like structure of constant height .",
    "since for the parameters chosen ( generic as they are ) @xmath50 , we chose @xmath51 inside the centrifugal barrier ( @xmath52 ) as in an adiabatic flow .",

    "since they start with zero abundances , we plot them from radius @xmath58 cm for clarity .",
    "we put a long dashed vertical line at @xmath56au , the distance of the earth with respect to the sun . on the upper axis ,",
    "we have put time ( in seconds ) elapsed since the beginning of collapse at radial distances of @xmath59 cm , @xmath60 cm , @xmath61 cm and @xmath62 cm respectively . towards the end of the collapse ,",

    "because of low initial velocity , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are depleted much before @xmath67au and @xmath8 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 etc .",
    "rises as also the more complex molecules ( fig .",
    "2b ) which form out of them . inside @xmath70 ,",
    "as matter falls faster and spends lesser time , the depletion of lighter molecules are controlled , until the density and temperature also rises so high that depletion started once more .",
    "inside , @xmath71 cm , the composition changes in a very short timescale around @xmath72au , the mass fractions of adenine , urea and glycine are already significant . at @xmath73au , @xmath74 .",
    "since the mass of the earth is around @xmath75 g , this corresponds to @xmath76 g of adenine which could have contaminated the earth at the time of formation ( it could be higher since metallic content of earth is much above the average molecular value . also , one has to include the effect of dust - gas mixture in the molecular cloud ) this computation , does not consider the destructions of adenine at a higher temperature region , and it is likely that much of these contaminants are destroyed during collapse and formation of proto - earth .",
    "however , comets formed in the inner cloud could carry away these pre - biotic molecules and deposit them during future impacts on planets .",
    "it is to be noted that around @xmath56au , the composition is close to reducing ( @xmath57 ) type ( fig .",
    "2a ) which is favourable for the formation of bio - molecules .    since regions of low density of molecular cloud could have a very long evolution time scale , it may of interest whether pre - biotic molecules could have formed in a very low density isothermal region . to this effect",
    ", we choose a cloud of mass density @xmath77 g @xmath38 and @xmath33k and let it evolve for @xmath78 years .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of this simulation where we plot the variation of abundance with time ( in seconds ) .",
    "we find that the abundance of adenine , for instance , is around @xmath79 .",
    "this is a very generic condition , and the abundance is significant .",
    "we therefore believe that adenine could be produced during the molecular cloud collapse .    :",
    "log - log plot of the mass fractions of some pre - biotic molecules ( marked ) as functions of time during the evolution of a static cloud of constant density and temperature for @xmath78 years .",
    "it is generally thought that molecules vital to living systems on earth may have started from scratch . in this _ letter _ , we have explored the possibility of formation of a dna base , namely adenine , and a few of the simpler amino acids during a generic molecular cloud collapse and show that mass fraction of adenine is significant which might have contaminated the planetary disk even before the formation of the planets themselves . in a static evolution of a cloud of constant density and temperature , the formation of adenine is also important , and therefore our conclusion may be very generic .",
    "the rates we have chosen are reasonable , though uncertainties of an order of magnitude can not be ruled out at this stage as more accurate estimates require one to have temperature dependent rate coefficients of both forward and reverse reactions .    since earth is a generic planet and since it seems apparent that bio - molecules are as naturally produced as any other complex molecules , we believe that dna bases produced in collapsing cloud could have contaminated the earth , and at the same time there should be many such planets in each galaxy where dna based lives should flourish .",
    "it is not yet clear whether or not these molecules survived during further evolution of planetary disks leading to eventual formation of planets or actual contaminations were made much later by comets carrying away protecting these molecules .",
    "these vital issues will be addressed in due course .",
