    "in this paper , we perform the first benchmark of finite - volume lattice methods for the low - energy scattering of composite objects .",
    "our results will have immediate applications to lattice studies of elastic neutron - nucleus scattering .  in the analysis presented here we consider scattering between a fermion and a bound dimer composed of two fermions .  in order to test the precision of our lattice calculations",
    ", we also repeat the same calculations using the skorniakov - ter - martirosian ( stm ) integral equation @xcite .  along the way we also provide the most accurate calculation to date for the fermion - dimer effective range parameter .",
    "some of the results presented were summarized in a letter publication @xcite , and we present the full details of the calculations here .",
    "we consider two component fermions .",
    "we will refer to the two fermion components as spin up and spin down and consider the case when the masses are equal , @xmath4 .",
    "we assume finite - range attractive interactions and consider the universal shallow binding limit .",
    "if @xmath5 is the range of the interactions and @xmath6 is the binding momentum of the dimer , then the shallow binding limit corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "we note that much of the literature on universal three - body systems has focused on the efimov effect @xcite for three bosons , three - component fermions , unequal mass fermions , or mixed bose - fermi systems @xcite .  for equal mass two - component fermions , however , there are no short - distance three - body instabilities such as the thomas collapse @xcite",
    ".  hence there are no relevant momentum scales other than the dimer binding momentum @xmath6 , and all low - energy scattering parameters can be expressed as dimensionless constants times the corresponding power of @xmath6 .  in the shallow binding limit",
    "@xmath6 is the same as the reciprocal of the fermion - fermion scattering length .",
    "there have been numerous calculations of the fermion - dimer scattering length .",
    "the first goes back to the early work of skorniakov and ter - martirosian who found @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an overview of the skorniakov - ter - martirosian ( stm ) integral equation method will be presented in our discussion below .  the same value @xmath8 has been confirmed several times using integral equations @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath9 was obtained using an epsilon expansion in dimensions @xcite .",
    "a recent correlated gaussian expansion calculation obtained @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this agrees with integral equation studies which found @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the fermion - dimer results at shallow binding should approximately describe neutron - deuteron scattering in the spin - quartet channel .",
    "experimental measurements find a quartet scattering length @xmath13  fm @xcite .",
    "this corresponds with @xmath14 .",
    "the agreement is better when expressed as fraction of the spin - triplet proton - neutron scattering length , @xmath15 .",
    "the 30% difference between the two values gives an indication of higher order effective range effects .",
    "a more detailed calculation including interaction range effects obtains @xmath16  fm @xcite , in full agreement with experimental values .",
    "in contrast with the scattering length , there is only one previously reported determination of the fermion - dimer effective range parameter .",
    "the correlated gaussian expansion calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath17 .",
    "neutron - deuteron scattering data also favors a small value for @xmath18 .",
    "however the sign of @xmath18 has remained an open question .  in our continuum calculations presented here",
    ", we use the stm equation to calculate the scattering length and effective range parameter .",
    "we find the values @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our main focus though is to benchmark lattice calculations of the fermion - dimer scattering length and effective range parameter .  for the lattice calculation we apply the finite - volume phase - shift analysis of lscher .",
    "we show that finite - volume topological corrections to the dimer binding energy must be considered in order to obtain accurate results .",
    "once these topological corrections are included in the finite - volume analysis , we find that the lattice and continuum calculations are in full agreement .",
    "we use two different lattice hamiltonian formulations , that agree in the continuum limit .  as a final result",
    "we find : @xmath19",
    "few - body systems of two - component fermions with short - range interactions and large scattering lengths in comparison to interparticle distances show universal properties .",
    "physics in such systems does not depend on the structure of the interactions at short distances .",
    "the problem of three two - component fermions at low energies can be described by a local quantum field theory whose only interaction term is a two - body contact interaction .  in the following",
    ", we will always consider equal mass fermions with mass @xmath20 .",
    "the extension to unequal masses is straightforward .",
    "the free non - relativistic effective hamiltonian in momentum space can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are annihilation and creation operators .  in position space",
    "these operators can be expressed as @xmath24 combining eqs .",

    "can be replaced by a delta - function interaction @xmath28 and the the lowest order effective hamiltonian for two - component fermions is @xmath29 @xmath30 denotes the two - body coupling constant and is directly related to the fermion - fermion scattering length .",
    "it is assumed to be negative so that the interaction is attractive .",
    "the exact value of @xmath30 depends on the scheme used to regulate the short distance behavior .    in the next step",
