    "superhumps are modulations of the light curves of binary systems with periods that differ from the orbital periods by several percent , and are observed mainly during superoutbursts in su  uma systems .",
    "the main observational features of superhumps are described in  @xcite .",
    "various authors have put forward models to explain the superhump phenomenon ( a brief description of various models and their problems are given , for instance , in  @xcite ) .",
    "currently , the most popular model explains these light variations as an effect of precession of the outer regions of the accretion disk .",
    "the presence of the lindblad 3:1 resonance in the disk results in an instability that leads to precession of the outer part of the disk , with a period that is appreciably longer than the orbital period .",
    "the beating of the orbital and precessional periods gives rise to the periodic variations that are identified with superhumps .",
    "this model has several shortcomings , the most important being that it implies a limit on the maximum component mass ratio . in order for the lindblad 3:1 resonance to be located inside the accretion disk , the ratio of the donor and accretor masses",
    "@xmath2 must be lower than @xmath3  @xcite , while there are several observed systems with superhumps that have appreciably higher @xmath2 values , such as tv  col .",
    "tv  col is a `` permanent superhumper '' , or one of a class of systems in which superhumps are always observed .",
    "it was suggested in  @xcite that cataclysmic variables with high mass - transfer rates ( tv  col is such a system ) may persist in a superhump regime that is not interrupted by quiescent periods . among stars with superhumps ,",
    "tv  col has an unusually long orbital period , @xmath4  h  @xcite .",
    "since there is a direct correlation between the orbital period of a system and the donor mass ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) , this may be as high as @xmath5 , while the component - mass ratio is probably in the range @xmath6  @xcite.it is obvious that the lindblad 3:1 resonance can not be located inside the accretion disk with such a @xmath2 value .",
    "this casts doubt on the popular superhump model indicated above .    in 2004 , a new mechanism for the formation of superhumps in su  uma systems was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the basis of this mechanism is the idea that a precessional - type density wave can form in the accretion disk .    the precessional wave in the accretion disks forms as a result of interactions between elliptical streamlines .",
    "the asphericity of the gravitational field of the binary system forces the semimajor axes of the streamlines to precess opposite to the direction in which the matter flows .",
    "the rate of this precession is proportional to the semimajor axis of the corresponding streamline .",
    "since the streamlines in the disk can not intersect , their interaction results in the establishment of a certain equilibrium precession rate of all the streamlines , with their apastrons lining up so that they form a spiral pattern . because the matter velocity is minimum at the apastrons , the density of the matter at these points grows , and a precessional spiral density wave is formed in the disk .    after the formation of the precessional density wave in the disk , the rate of accretion grows sharply ( by up to an order of magnitude ) .",
    "matter approaches the surface of the accretor along the precessional wave , and the region of accretion is localized in azimuth , and , hence , forms a radiating spot at the surface of accretor .",
    "the increase in the accretion rate due to the density wave explains both the development of a superoutburst and the amplitude of the superhump .",
    "the wave slowly precesses in the stationary ( observer s ) coordinate frame , leading to a shift of the region of enhanced accretion ( i.e. , of the superhump ) with each rotation of the system .",
    "the beating of the orbital period and the precessional period of the wave result in the superhump period , which is slightly larger than the orbital period .",
    "this superoutburst model based on the presence of a precessional spiral wave in the accretion disk  @xcite made it possible for the first time to explain all important observational manifestations of superoutbursts and superhumps in su  uma systems , including their period , duration , and energy , the anticorrelation of the brightness and color temperature at the maximum of an ordinary superhump , the late - superhump phenomenon , etc .",
    "moreover , this model does not place strict constraints on the component mass ratio , and so can be applied to the superhumps in the tv  col system .    the main aim of the present paper is to investigate the possible formation of precessional spiral waves in accretion disks in systems with @xmath7 .",
    "we will also consider the possibility of explaining all types of superhumps with this model .",
    "the model used for our numerical simulations of mass flows in binary systems is described in  @xcite .",
    "the flow is described by a three - dimensional system of gravitational gas - dynamics equations , including nonadiabatic radiative heating and cooling of the gas :    @xmath8 \\dfrac{\\partial\\rho{{\\bf v}}}{\\partial t } + { \\mathop{\\rm div}\\nolimits}(\\rho{{\\bf v}}\\otimes{{\\bf v}})+{\\mathop{\\rm grad}\\nolimits}p=-\\rho{\\mathop{\\rm grad}\\nolimits}\\phi   - 2 [ { { \\bf \\omega}}_{bin}\\times{{\\bf v}}]\\rho \\,,\\\\[5 mm ] \\dfrac{\\partial\\rho(\\varepsilon+|{{\\bf v}}|^2/2)}{\\partial t } + { \\mathop{\\rm div}\\nolimits}\\rho{{\\bf v}}(\\varepsilon+p/\\rho+|{{\\bf v}}|^2/2)=\\\\ \\qquad\\qquad-\\rho{{\\bf v}}{\\mathop{\\rm grad}\\nolimits}\\phi+\\rho^2m_p^{-2 } \\left(\\gamma(t , t_{wd})-\\lambda(t)\\right ) . \\end{array } \\right .",

    "\\(4 ) superhumps have the same features as positive superhumps , but are observed in stars that lack superoutbursts .",
    "\\(5 ) superhumps have a period that is several percent shorter than the orbital period .",
    "such superhumps were first discovered during monitoring of systems with permanent superhumps .",
    "the precessional spiral wave model is able to explain all types of observed superhumps .",
    "the main observational features of positive and late superhumps are a direct consequence of the formation of a precessional spiral wave in the disk , as is explained in  @xcite .",
    "the orbital superhump can be explained by the release of energy in stationary shocks in the disk and circumdisk halo , such as the hot - line and tidal shocks ; the existence of tidal shocks is not precluded in the precessional wave model .",
    "permanent superhumps can also be explained , if the mass - transfer rate in the system is high enough to sustain a high accretion rate due to prolonged existence of the precessional spiral wave .",
    "the existence of luminosity modulations whose period is shorter than the orbital period , i.e. , of negative superhumps , can also be plausibly explained in this model .    in the model ,",
    "the superhump radiation arises from a relatively compact region near the surface of the accretor , into which matter flows along the precessional wave . if the bright spot arising in this region is located above the accretor surface ( i.e. , the rotation of accretor does not influence the motion of the spot ) and has a tendency to spread out due to diffusion , the leading edge of the spot may be observed somewhat earlier after each rotation of the system , creating a modulation with a period shorter than the orbital period .",
    "the fact that the observed periods of negative superhumps do not display significant scatter can be taken to justify the assumption that the energy release occurs above the surface of the accretor .",
    "the necessary rate of diffusional spreading can be estimated using the observed period .",
    "let us denote the observed `` period excess '' for a negative superhump  @xmath39 , where  @xmath40 is the orbital period of the system and  @xmath41 is the observed period of the negative superhump . for tv",
    "col , @xmath42  h  @xcite , so  @xmath43 . if the observed period is the result that of beating between the orbital period and rotational period of the leading edge of the spot  @xmath44 , this period can be found using the formula @xmath45 the linear velocity of the spot edge will be @xmath46 if the radius of the accretor is  @xmath47 .",
    "the velocity of the leading edge has two components : the rate of diffusional spreading @xmath48 and the ( negative ) velocity of the spot center , relative to the retrograde precession of the wave , @xmath49 . knowing the period of the precessional wave @xmath50 ( or the period excess of the positive superhump @xmath51 ) , we can find the linear velocity of the wave , @xmath49 : @xmath52 this velocity is negative , since the direction of the wave precession is retrograde . accordingly , @xmath48 will be given by @xmath53    let find a relation between the diffusion rate derived from observations and the parameters of the disk gas .",
    "the time scale for diffusion over a distance @xmath54 is  @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the diffusion coefficient  @xcite .",
    "if  @xmath57 , the linear diffusion rate is @xmath58 in this case , the diffusion coefficient for the tv  col system will be @xmath59    the diffusion coefficient for an ionized gas is defined as @xmath60 , and depends on the mean free path @xmath61 and rms velocity @xmath62 . for ionized gas , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the temperature of the gas , @xmath65 the number density of particles , and @xmath66 .",
    "the rms velocity is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is boltzmann s constant and  @xmath69 is the mass of the gas particles .",
    "accordingly , the diffusion coefficient is a function of the temperature and number density of the matter : @xmath70 .",
    "thus , if we know the value of @xmath56 from observations , it is possible to find @xmath65 and @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ d_nt ] shows the dependence  @xmath71 for various @xmath65 .",
    "the dashed line shows the value of  @xmath56 that corresponds to the observed diffusion for tv  col . if we can estimate the typical temperature from observations of the superhump , fig .",
    "[ d_nt ] can be used to find the density of matter in the spot .",
    "let us now assume that there is pressure equilibrium in the accretion disk , so that @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the number density and temperature of the outer parts of the disk .",
    "assuming that  @xmath75 , we can find the typical number density in the disk , @xmath73 .",
    "figure  [ eps_t ] shows a set of solutions for various @xmath73 ( for @xmath76 ) . for convenience ,",
    "we also show  @xmath77 for tv  col in this figure .",
    "if we suppose the temperature of the spot to be @xmath78 and use the observed value of  @xmath79 ( dashed line ) , then @xmath80 .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath64 and @xmath73 are within the range typical for accretion disks in close binary systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , this model with the diffusional spreading of the spot can adequately explain the observed negative superhumps .",
    "our numerical modeling has shown that precessional density waves can form in the accretion disks of systems with large component mass ratios , up to @xmath81 .",
    "our derived dependence of the precession period on  @xmath2 is complex .",
    "figure  [ prec ] shows the theoretical dependence  @xmath82 obtained in  @xcite ( bold dashed line ) .",
    "the open circles in this figure show the period excesses found for three different sets of parameters of tv  col .",
    "we also show the model  @xmath82 values for oy  car and ip  peg found in  @xcite . despite the significant scatter ,",
    "all the  @xmath82 values are fairly close to the theoretical line , although the values for @xmath83  ( ip  peg ) and @xmath81  ( tv  col ) are outliers .",
    "note that the rotational rate of the precessional density wave depends not only on the component mass ratio , but also on the size of the region occupied by the wave .",
    "the wave can exist only in a gas - dynamically unperturbed region of the disk , whose size is limited by the depth of penetration of stationary shocks  the two arms of the tidal shocks and the hot line ( extended region of interaction of the stream from @xmath21 and the circumdisk halo )  into the disk . the high masstransfer rate in tv  col may result in an increase in the extent of the hot line and , consequently , to precession rates that are lower than expected theoretically .",
    "it is interesting that , in the case of high component mass ratios , the size of the unperturbed region may be significantly limited by tidal waves , which would result in an even larger decrease of the precession rate with increasing @xmath2 , compared to the theoretical value . nevertheless , the dependence is close to the theoretical dependence , and has a peak in the range @xmath84 .    in tv",
    "col , superhumps with the period @xmath85  h  @xcite are observed , so that the superhump period excess is @xmath86 .",
    "this value is out of the range of the theoretical estimates of the precession rate ( but does not exceed the value obtained in  @xcite for ip  peg ) .",
    "the theoretical dependence for  @xmath82 was obtained in the model that did not take into account the gas pressure ; i.e. , it effectively estimates the precession rate of the semimajor axis of the orbit of a free particle .",
    "the excesses of the observed and simulated precession rates over the theoretical values may indicate that the estimated disk radius used in the simulations , @xmath87  @xcite , is too low ( in fact , the derivations in  @xcite did not take into account the gas pressure ) .",
    "if the disk radius were 10% larger ( @xmath88 ) , all the derived precession rates would be below the theoretical line ( shown by the thin dashed line in fig .",
    "[ prec ] ) .    in summary , we conclude that the presence of a precessional density wave in the disk can lead to superhumps both in su  uma stars and in binaries whose component mass ratios prohibit the location of the 3:1 lindblad resonance inside the disk .",
