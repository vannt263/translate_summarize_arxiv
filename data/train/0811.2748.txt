    "generic inflationary models based on the slow roll of a scalar field predict a nearly scale - invariant and gaussian spectrum of primordial curvature fluctuations ( see bartolo 2004 for a review ) . while the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies favour a slightly red power spectrum ( komatsu 2008 ) , no significant detection of primordial non - gaussianity has been reported as yet from cmb and large - scale structures measurements .",
    "nevertheless , improving the current limits would still strongly constrain mechanisms for the generation of cosmological perturbations .",
    "non - gaussianity can be generated by nonlinearities in the relation between the primordial curvature perturbation and the inflaton field ( e.g. salopek & bond 1990 ; gangui 1994 ) , interaction of scalar fields ( e.g. falk 1993 ) or deviation from the ( bunch - davies ) ground state ( e.g. lesgourgues 1997 ) .",
    "a wide class of inflationary scenarios lead to non - gaussianity of the local type , which depends on the local value of the potential only . in these models ,",
    "deviation from gaussianity can be conveniently parametrised by a nonlinear coupling parameter @xmath0 through the relation ( e.g. komatsu & spergel 2001 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gaussian part of the curvature perturbation in the matter area .",
    "while single inflaton scenarios predict @xmath0 much less than unity , multi - field inflation models can generate @xmath10 ( linde & mukhanov 1997 ; lyth 2003 ; creminelli 2003 ; dvali 2004 ; zaldarriaga 2004 ; arkani - hamed 2004 ; alishahiha 2004 ) .",
    "alternatives to inflation , such as cyclic / ekpyrotic model also predict large non - gaussianity of local type ( creminelli & senatore 2007 , buchbinder 2008 , lehners & steinhardt 2008 ) .",
    "higher order statistics of the curvature perturbation such as the bispectrum can be computed straightforwardly from a perturbative expansion of the homogeneous robertson - walker background ( e.g. acquaviva 2003 ; maldacena 2003 ) .",
    "these statistics are related to those of the cmb temperature anisotropy through the radiation transfer function , which can be computed accurately using , e.g. , cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "thus far , analysis of the cmb bispectrum indicates that the data are fully consistent with gaussianity , with @xmath11 ( komatsu 2003 ; creminelli 2007 ; komatsu 2008 ; smith 2009 ; see , however , yadav & wandelt 2008 who report a detection at the 2.5@xmath12 level ) , providing strong evidence for the quantum origin of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "large - scale structures offer another route to test for the presence of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "it has long been recognised that departure from gaussianity can significantly affect the high mass tail of the dark matter halo distribution ( lucchin & matarrese 1988 ; colafrancesco 1989 ; chiu 1998 ; robinson & baker 2000 ; matarrese 2000 ; mathis 2004 , kang 2007 ; grossi 2007 ) .",
    "following this approach , x - ray cluster counts have been used to constrain the amount of non - gaussianity ( e.g. koyama 1999 , robinson 2000 ; willick 2000 ; amara & refregier 2004 ) .",
    "galaxy clustering is also sensitive to the statistical properties of the primeval fluctuations .",
    "indeed , grinstein & wise ( 1986 ) pointed out early that primordial non - gaussianity could significantly increase the amplitude of the two - point correlation of galaxies and clusters on large scales .",
    "however , recent work has mostly focused on higher order statistics such as the bispectrum ( scoccimarro 2004 ; sefusatti & komatsu 2007 ) .",
    "dalal ( 2008 ) have recently sparked renewed interest in the clustering of rare objects by demonstrating the strong scale - dependent bias arising from primordial non - gaussianity of the local type .",
    "it can be shown that the latter contributes a scale - dependent bias of the form ( dalal 2008 ; matarrese & verde 2008 ; slosar 2008 ) @xmath13\\dc\\frac{\\omega_{\\rm m}h_0 ^ 2}{k^2 t(k ) d(z)}\\ ; , \\label{eq : bshift}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the linear bias parameter , @xmath14 is the hubble parameter , @xmath15 is the matter transfer function , @xmath16 is the growth factor normalised to @xmath17 in the matter era and @xmath18 is the present - day ( linear ) critical density threshold .",
    "while the derivation of this non - gaussian bias correction presented in dalal ( 2008 ) and matarrese & verde ( 2008 ) is strictly valid only for the highest peaks of the density field , the peak - background split argument invoked by slosar ( 2008 ) suggests that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bshift ] ) should apply to all peaks unrestrictedly , but is only valid in the limit of long wavelength modes so that the background can be approximated as a constant density .",
    "further work has confirmed the basic picture ( afshordi & tolley 2008 ; mcdonald 2008 ; taruya 2008 ) .",
    "slosar ( 2008 ) have applied eq .",
    "( [ eq : bshift ] ) to constrain the value of @xmath0 using a compilation of large - scale structure data .",
    "they find @xmath19 ( at 95% confidence level ) .",
    "these limits are competitive with those from wmap5 , @xmath20 ( komatsu 2008 ) and @xmath21 ( smith 2009 ) , demonstrating the promise of the method . future all sky surveys could achieve constraints of the order of @xmath22 ( dalal 2008 ; afshordi & tolley 2008 ; mcdonald 2008 ; carbone 2008 ) , assuming one knows how to extract maximum information from the data ( see , e.g. , slosar 2008 ) .",
    "in fact , with sufficient high density of tracers it should be possible to circumvent the sampling variance ( which is a serious issue since the non - gaussian effect is strongest on the largest scales ) and alleviate degeneracies with other cosmological parameters , thereby allowing for a potentially huge gains ( seljak 2008 ) .",
    "still , in order to fully exploit the potential of forthcoming large - scale surveys , the method needs to be tested with large numerical simulations .",
    "thus far , eq .  ( [ eq : bshift ] ) has been validated only using the halo - matter cross - power spectrum ( dalal 2008 ) and only on very large scales , so its accuracy remains uncertain .",
    "it is important to measure the effect in the auto - correlation of dark matter haloes , since the latter gives the strongest constraint on @xmath0 ( slosar 2008 ) .",
    "it is also important to extend the analysis to smaller scales , where the peak - background split breaks down , as well as to less biased haloes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address these issues in more detail .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the n - body simulations against which we calibrate the theory (  [ sec : nbody ] ) .",
    "next , we discuss the mass function and bias of the corresponding halo catalogues and demonstrate the importance of including a scale - independent bias correction in the comparison with the simulations (  [ sec : haloes ] ) .",
    "the main body of the paper is  [ sec : ngbias ] , where we study in detail the impact of local non - gaussianity on the halo - matter and halo - halo power spectrum .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "investigating the scale - dependence of the halo bias requires simulations large enough so that many long wavelength modes are sampled . at the same time",
    ", the simulations should resolve dark matter haloes hosting luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) or quasars ( qsos ) , so that one can construct halo samples whose statistical properties mimic as closely as possible those of the real data .    in this work",
    ", we use a series of large n - body simulations of the @xmath1cdm cosmology seeded with gaussian and non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "the non - gaussianity is of the `` local '' form , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the bardeen potential .",
    "it is important to note that this local transformation is performed before multiplication by the matter transfer function .",
    "@xmath15 is computed with cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) for the wmap5 best - fitting parameters ( komatsu 2008 )  : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and a normalisation of the curvature perturbations @xmath29 ( at @xmath30mpc@xmath31 ) which gives @xmath32 .",
    "five sets of three 1024@xmath33 simulations , each of which has @xmath34 , were run with the n - body code gadget2 ( springel 2005 ) .",
    "we used the same gaussian random seed field @xmath35 in each set of runs so as to minimise the sampling variance .",
    "we also explored lower values of @xmath0 and ran 2 realisations for each of the non - gaussian models characterized by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in all cases the box size is 1600@xmath38 with a force resolution of 0.04 times the mean interparticle distance .",
    "the particle mass of these simulations thus is @xmath39 , enough to resolve haloes down to @xmath40 .",
    "haloes were identified using the mpi parallelised version of the ahf halo finder which is based on the spherical overdensity ( so ) finder developed by gill , knebe & gibson ( 2004 ) .",
    "ahf estimates the local density around each halo centre using a top - hat aperture .",

    "note that @xmath44 is an increasing function of redshift ( @xmath45 at @xmath46 ) .",
    "we discard poorly resolved haloes and only study those containing at least 34 particles to reduce the error in the mass estimate ( warren 2006 ) .",
    "this implies a lower mass limit @xmath47 which is about the typical mass of qso - hosting haloes at @xmath48 ( e.g. porciani & norberg 2006 ) and is a few times smaller than the mass of haloes harbouring lrgs in sdss ( mandelbaum etal .",
    "analytic arguments based on the press - schechter theory ( press - schechter 1974 ; bond 1991 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ) predict that the halo mass function @xmath49 is entirely specified by the distribution @xmath50 of first - crossings , or multiplicity function @xmath51 the peak height @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the critical linear overdensity for collapse ( assumed spherical throughout this paper ) , is the typical amplitude of fluctuations that produce haloes of mass @xmath41 by redshift @xmath54 .",

    "the numerical data are plotted with respect to the sheth - tormen function ( sheth - tormen 1999 ) to emphasise the large deviation from the latter .",
    "this departure is , however , not really surprising since the sheth - tormen formula is a fit to the mass function of friends - of - friends haloes ( extracted from the gif simulations , see kauffmann 1999 ) .",
    "we have not attempted to fit the multiplicity function of our so haloes given the limited volume and dynamic range of our simulations .",
    "instead , we have found more useful to assess whether the impact of local non - gaussianity on the halo mass function is consistent with theoretical expectations .    to test this",
    "we have plotted the ratio @xmath59 in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for the simulations with @xmath60",
    ". the presence of primordial non - gaussianity enhances or suppresses the high peak tail of the multiplicity function depending on the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "as recognised in previous papers ( e.g. matarrese 2000 ; sefusatti 2007 ) , despite the lack of a reliable gaussian mass function , deviations from gaussianity can be modelled analytically using the press - schechter formalism . here",
    "we follow the simple extension introduced by loverde ( 2008 ; see also chiu 1998 ) and replace the gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field by the generic edgeworth expansion ( e.g. , scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ; juskiewicz 1995 ) . neglecting cumulants other than the skewness @xmath61 and truncating the series expansion at @xmath62 , the non - gaussian correction factor reads ( loverde 2008 ) @xmath63 after integration over regions above the critical density for collapse .",
    "note that we have omitted the explicit redshift dependence .",
    "strictly speaking however , the ratio @xmath59 depends distinctly upon the variables @xmath41 ( or @xmath64 ) _ and _ @xmath54 due to the presence of @xmath65 .",
    "our notation is motivated by the fact that the measured non - gaussian correction , as plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , appears to depend mostly on the peak height .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ngfnu ] ) requires knowledge of the skewness @xmath66 of the smoothed density field @xmath67 , which we compute analytically using the relation ( see appendix   [ app : pt ] ) @xmath68 \\nonumber \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the power spectrum of linear curvature perturbations in the matter - dominated era , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a ( spherically symmetric ) window function of characteristic mass scale @xmath41 . over the mass range probed by our simulations , @xmath73 ,",
    "@xmath74 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath41 that varies in the narrow range @xmath75 for the top - hat filter assumed here .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath76 term dominates the total contribution to the non - gaussian correction when the peak height is @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting non - gaussian correction is plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for two different redshifts , @xmath46 ( dotted ) and 2 ( dotted - dashed ) . the truncated expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq : ngfnu ] ) agrees reasonably well with the numerical data , suggesting thereby that cumulants higher than @xmath62 may not be important in the range of mass and redshift considered here .",
    "note also that for positive @xmath0 the mass function is enhanced more at the high mass end and that this is similar to an increase in the amplitude of fluctuations @xmath78 .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is somewhat degenerate with @xmath78 since , in both cases , the effect increases with mass ( compare with fig.3 of mandelbaum & seljak 2007 for instance ) .",
    "however , at @xmath79 ( i.e. @xmath80 at @xmath46 ) the increase in mass function for @xmath81 is 15% , which corresponds to less than 0.01 change in @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , given the current uncertainties in the cluster abundance ( which translate into 0.03 error on @xmath78 , vikhlinin 2008 ) , the prospects of using halo mass function to place competitive limits on @xmath0 with the current data are small .",
    "having checked that the level of non - gaussianity in the mass function is consistent with simple theoretical expectations , we now turn to the clustering of dark matter haloes .",
    "we interpolate the dark matter particles and halo centres onto a regular cubical mesh .",
    "the resulting dark matter and halo fluctuation fields , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are then fourier transformed to yield the matter - matter , halo - matter and halo - halo power spectra @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "notice that the power spectra are computed on a 512@xmath33 grid to reduce the computational expenses . still , the nyquist wavenumber is sufficiently large , @xmath87 , to allow for an accurate measurement of the power in wavemodes of amplitude @xmath88 . as we will see shortly , the impact of local non - gaussianity is negligible at @xmath89 , but increases rapidly with decreasing wavenumber .",
    "on linear scales , the halo bias @xmath90 approaches a constant , albeit mass - dependent value @xmath3 . the linear halo bias @xmath3 needs to be measured accurately as it controls the strength of the scale - dependent bias correction induced by local non - gaussianity . to proceed",
    ", we may consider the following estimates of @xmath91 for a given halo sample , @xmath92 in the following , we will always correct the halo power spectrum for shot - noise , which we assume to be @xmath93 if dark matter haloes are a poisson sampling of some continuous field . while this discreteness correction is negligible for @xmath84 and @xmath85 due to the large number of dark matter particles",

    "the slight offset between @xmath94 and @xmath95 suggests that the shot - noise correction @xmath93 might be too large for the low bias haloes and too small for the highest bias halo .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the hypothesis of shot noise being @xmath93 for the dark matter haloes remains unproven ( mcdonald 2008 ) and it is an issue worth exploring further",

    "feature some scale - dependence on smaller scales , @xmath98 .",
    "this is best seen in the most biased sample .",
    "we will use @xmath94 as a proxy for the linear halo bias since it is less sensitive to shot - noise . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the horizontal lines indicate our fit to @xmath3 obtained from the measurement of @xmath94 at wavenumber @xmath99 .",
    "as shown in dalal ( 2008 ) , matarrese & verde ( 2008 ) and slosar ( 2008 ) , local non - gaussianity gives rise to the scale - dependent bias correction eq .",
    "( [ eq : bshift ] ) .",
    "however , at the lowest order there are two additional , albeit relatively smaller , corrections which arise from the dependence of both the halo number density @xmath49 and the matter power spectrum @xmath100 on @xmath0 .",
    "as we will see shortly , the inclusion of these extra terms substantially improves the comparison between the theory and the simulations .",
    "firstly , assuming the peak - background split holds , the change in the mean number density of haloes induces a scale - independent shift which we denote by @xmath101 .",

    "furthermore , since we consider only first order corrections to the gaussian bias , we set @xmath105 in the above expression so that @xmath106 is truly first order in @xmath0 .    secondly , primordial non - gaussianity affects the matter power spectrum as positive values of @xmath0 tend to increase the small - scale power ( scoccimarro 2004 ; grossi 2008 ; taruya 2008 ) . for @xmath107 ,",

    "for this particular sample , the shot - noise correction enhances the measurement of @xmath2 by 10 - 15 per cent at scales @xmath129 , regardless of the sign of @xmath0 . while the exact amount of correction depends upon the bias and the number density of the halo sample under consideration , it is clear that any attempt to measure @xmath2 at the few per cent level must include the discreteness correction .",
    "we have measured power spectra for a range of halo masses and redshifts , covering the relevant range of statistical properties corresponding to the available data sets of galaxies or quasar populations with different luminosities and bias .",
    "the results are summarised in figures  [ fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] , where the averaged @xmath130 and @xmath120 are plotted as a function of wavenumber .",
    "the deviation from the theoretical prediction , @xmath131 , is also shown at the bottom of each panel .",
    "the shaded region indicates a deviation less than 20 per cent . to reduce the impact of sampling variance ,",
    "we first compute the ratios @xmath132 and @xmath133 for each realisation , and then average over the realisations ( see , e.g. , smith 2007 ) . we note that reversing the sequence of operations , i.e. taking the ratio of averaged power spectra , gives very similar average values .",
    "error bars denote the scatter around the mean and , therefore , may underestimate the true errors since they are computed from a small number of realisations .",
    "as we can see , the theoretical prediction provides a very good description of the simulations at small wavenumber @xmath134 , but the ratio @xmath131 differs significantly from unity at larger wavenumbers .",
    "the exact amount of deviation depends weakly on the sign of @xmath0 . for moderately biased haloes with @xmath135",
    "the theory approaches the numerical results already on scale @xmath136 .",
    "for the highly biased samples @xmath137 , the theory overpredicts the effect seen in simulations on all scales , but somewhat more on smaller scales , although in the high bias limit the numerical data is noisier due to the very low number density of haloes .",
    "it is worth noticing that , at the largest scales @xmath138 , the cross - power spectrum @xmath139 goes negative while @xmath140 remains positive and even increases , in good agreement with the analytic prediction .",
    "we suspect these deviations at high wavenumber are mostly due to the breakdown of the peak - background split approximation which was used in the derivation of the scale - dependent bias term @xmath113 in slosar ( 2008 ) . for this approximation to be valid",
    "one assumes that the long wavelength modes act as a homogeneous change of the background , from which the effect of the non - gaussianity is computed by comparing it to the local rescaling of the fluctuation amplitude .",
    "clearly this assumption breaks down once the wavelength of the mode becomes small .",
    "uncertainties in the scale - independent correction also affect @xmath141 .",
    "in this paper we use analytic predictions based on equation ( [ eq : bi ] ) , but we could also treat the scale - independent bias as a free parameter that we fit to the data , as done in the actual data analysis of slosar 2008 .",

    "finally , notice that the auto- and cross - power spectrum of haloes give comparable results at all but the ( poorly sampled ) largest scales , where sampling variance prevents us from making any conclusions .",
    "this confirms the validity of the analysis in slosar ( 2008 ) , where this effect was applied to the auto - correlations of galaxies and quasars .    to assess the extent to which the agreement between simulation and theory depends upon the halo mass and bias",

    "most of the information on the non - gaussian bias comes from measurements at large scale @xmath129 ( see slosar 2008 ) , where the theoretical model and the numerical data agree reasonably well with each other over the relevant range @xmath168 .    to reduce the scatter in the measurement of @xmath2",
    ", we can increase the bin width @xmath169 so as to increase the number of independent modes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , the ratio @xmath151 is shown as a function of the linear halo bias for three equally spaced logarithmic interval spanning the range @xmath170 ( e.g. @xmath171 ) .",
    "the data points are harvested from several outputs spanning the redshift range @xmath172 ( i.e. , the snapshot redshifts are @xmath46 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.4 , 1.7 and 2 ) .",
    "the squares and triangles represent the deviation from the theoretical prediction obtained by taking ratios of @xmath173 and @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "filled symbols show results for the non - gaussian simulations with @xmath175 .",
    "the error bars indicate our jackknife error estimates on the average @xmath131 .",
    "the non - gaussian bias shift of the low biased samples , @xmath176 , appears to deviate from the theory .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dbias ] ) may thus need correction when the linear bias gets lower than @xmath177 .",
    "the scale - dependent bias is quite large around @xmath178 , although for @xmath179 the effect does appear to vanish on the largest scales as expected ( see the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) . for the haloes with @xmath180 ,",
    "the theory matches the non - gaussian bias correction for @xmath181 .",
    "one would need even larger simulation boxes than used here to properly sample the largest scales . for @xmath182 , the effect",
    "is slightly suppressed compared to the theoretical prediction , but this may plausibly arise from uncertainties in the magnitude of the theoretical scale - independent shift @xmath106 . indeed , we have found that a 20 per cent increase in @xmath106 considerably improves the agreement for @xmath136 and , at the same time , is still consistent with the measured fractional change in the multiplicity function ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) . finally , note that that haloes with similar bias also have a comparable scale - dependent bias due to non - gaussianity regardless of redshift .",
    "hence , there is no need to introduce a second parameter such as redshift for the purpose of describing these results .",
    "the only previous work with simulations along these lines is that of dalal ( 2008 ) . these authors do not include the scale - independent shift @xmath106 nor the weaker correction @xmath116 induced by the matter power spectrum",
    "hence , fig .",
    "8 of their paper indeed shows @xmath183 .",
    "this ratio appears to increase with wavenumber ( even though their data points do not extend beyond @xmath184 ) , while the bottom panel of our fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows that @xmath183 is suppressed at high wavenumbers .",
    "note , however , that their theoretical scale - dependent correction @xmath185 does not include the matter transfer function .",
    "we found that , if the transfer function were removed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bshift ] ) , @xmath186 would be enhanced rather than suppressed as one goes to higher wavenumber , in qualitative agreement with their findings .",
    "since the non - gaussianity is imprinted in the initial conditions prior to the evolution through matter and radiation domination , the transfer function must be included in the analysis .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath187 also induces second and higher order corrections to the effective bias shift @xmath2 which may become important at high wavenumber . to test for these high order terms ,",
    "we explore in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] the scaling of the non - gaussian bias shift with the strength of the nonlinear parameter @xmath0 .",
    "symbols show the ratio @xmath188 ( which we abridge @xmath189 for shorthand convenience ) as a function of wavenumber and redshift for several values of @xmath190 and @xmath191 spanning the range [ -100,+100 ] , as indicated in the figure .",
    "note that the data points are obtained by averaging over two realisations only .",
    "the horizontal line indicates the value @xmath192 that should be reached if the non - gaussian bias shift is linear in @xmath0 .",
    "as we can see , there is less scatter in @xmath193 than in @xmath194 but , in both cases , the results are broadly consistent with the linear expectation @xmath192 .",
    "furthermore , there is no significant dependence on the wavenumber , redshift or the halo mass cut .",
    "we conclude that the sensitivity of large scale structure bias should extend to smaller values of @xmath0 as expected .",
    "thus far , we have investigated the impact of local non - gaussianity on two - point statistics in fourier space .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the two - point correlation @xmath195 in configuration space , which is related to the power spectrum @xmath196 through @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the zeroth spherical bessel function . in practice , since the simulation volume is a periodic cube , we compute the correlation from a discrete fourier transform of the power spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , the result of measuring the auto and cross - correlation functions is shown at @xmath199 for the mass cut @xmath96 .",
    "the width of the simulation box is large enough to sample wavemodes relevant to the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "the interesting feature of fig .  [ fig : fig10 ] is the correlation between the bao and the broadband power , which shows up differently in the correlation function than in the power spectrum . local non - gaussianity adds broadband power and , therefore , modulates the amplitude of the bao and the position of zero - crossing .",
    "the scale dependence of clustering of biased tracers of the density field has emerged as a powerful method to constrain the amount of primordial non - gaussianity of the local type . in this paper , we have measured the non - gaussian bias correction @xmath2 in the clustering of dark matter haloes extracted from a suite of large n - body simulations .",
    "in contrast to previous work , we focus both on the halo - halo and halo - matter power spectrum .",
    "while we confirm the basic effect reported in dalal ( 2008 ) , we emphasize the importance of including a scale - independent term @xmath106 and , to a lesser extent , a contribution induced by the matter power spectrum @xmath116 , to the scale - dependent shift @xmath200 when comparing the theoretical scaling to numerical simulations .",
    "the inclusion of these two first order corrections significantly improves the agreement at wavenumber @xmath88 .",
    "the original analysis in dalal ( 2008 ) only used cross - power spectra from simulations , while the data analysis in slosar ( 2008 ) used mostly auto - power analysis .",
    "the two do not have to agree with each other if the haloes and dark matter do not trace each other on large scales , i.e. if there is stochasticity .",
    "while models with gaussian initial conditions predict there is little stochasticity on large scales ( seljak & warren 2004 ) , this has not been shown explicitly for models with non - gaussianity .",
    "hence , one of the main motivations for this work was to extract the non - gaussianity effect from the auto - correlations .",
    "measurements of the non - gaussian bias correction obtained with the halo - halo or the halo - matter power spectrum are in a good agreement with each other , indicating that non - gaussianity does not induce stochasticity and the predicted scaling applies equally well for the auto- and cross - power spectrum . the issue of stochasticity in non - gaussian models will be explored further in a future publication .    for biased haloes ( @xmath201 ) ,",
    "our results indicate that the simulated non - gaussian bias converges towards the theoretical prediction for @xmath129 . at smaller scales ,",
    "the effect depends on scale - independent bias .",
    "if it is ignored then the amplitude of the effect is suppressed relative to theory .",
    "if we include scale independent bias using analytic calculation this suppression is much smaller and in some cases goes in the opposite direction .",
    "moreover , one could argue that scale - independent bias can not be identified from the data alone , so one should fit for it and include it in the overall bias , as was done in slosar 2008 . in this case",
    "the agreement between theory and simulations is improved further .",
    "still , there is some evidence that for very biased haloes , @xmath137 , the effect is suppressed relative to theory even on very large scales .    for the halo samples with @xmath202",
    "there is some evidence that the actual bias exceeds the theory on all scales .",
    "therefore , the proposed eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbias ] ) does not appear to be universal , so care must be exercised when applied to the actual large scale structure data .",
    "it would be useful to verify eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbias ] ) on dark matter haloes which are anti - biased ( @xmath166 ) relative to the matter distribution , to see if the sign of the effect is reversed . one , however , needs a very large volume and a very high mass resolution , which prevents us from verifying the predictions in this regime with the current simulations .    on the observational side , slosar ( 2008 )",
    "have already applied the method to a sample of highly biased lrgs and qsos , with mean bias @xmath203 and 2.7 , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to inspect how those constraints change in light of our analysis .",
    "our results suggest that for these values of halo bias theory and simulations are largely in agreement on relevant scales : their constraints arise mostly from the measurement of the quasar power spectrum with @xmath204 at the largest angular scales , @xmath138 and from lrgs with @xmath205 at @xmath206 . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , theoretical predictions are in very good agreement with the simulations for these values of bias and scales .",
    "hence , we thus expect their limits remain unchanged .    finally , we note that we have not considered other effects that may also modify the predictions , such as redshift space distortions and merger bias .",
    "the latter can significantly weaken the predicted scale - dependent bias ( slosar 2008 ) .",
    "we plan to investigate these effects with simulations in the future .",
    "we are indebted to volker springel and alexander knebe for making their code , resp .",
