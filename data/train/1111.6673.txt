    "self - assembled semiconductor quantum dots ( saqds ) possess many properties similar to real atoms , while simultaneously providing highly tunable properties for controlling and manipulating individual electron spins.@xcite such saqds are promising candidates as qubits for quantum computation , owing in part to the long coherence time,@xcite and high speed for optical coherent control.@xcite recently , much progress has been made using dot spin qubits to satisfy the divincenzo criteria for quantum computation,@xcite such as spin initialization,@xcite the coherent manipulation of electron spins,@xcite and fast spin nondestructive measurement.@xcite    a fundamental element in quantum computation is the entangling two - qubit quantum gate .",
    "a number of theoretical protocols for two - qubit gate have been proposed , including through optical rkky interaction,@xcite coulomb or tunnelling interactions between excited state in neighbouring dots,@xcite long - range coupling through waveguide - cavity system,@xcite and phonon - assisted zeno effect.@xcite these schemes have yet to be demonstrated experimentally , however .",
    "recently , ultrafast optical entanglement control utilizing the _ ground state _",
    "_ electron tunneling _ between two quantum - dot spins was experimentally realized.@xcite in this paper , we investigate an approach that takes advantage of the same type of vertically stacked self - assembled quantum dots in order to entangle the two conduction electron spins in the dots , using the _ excited _ valence _ hole tunneling _ as a means to couple the two electron spins . by adjusting the voltage of the schottky diode which houses the dots so that the two hole levels line up",
    "when one of the two electrons are optically excited into a trion , we avoid the tunnel coupling of the two electron spin qubits when there is no optical excitation .",
    "this method enables simpler single qubit operations .",
    "the key physics to accomplish a controlled phase gate is an optical rotation of only one basis state of the two spins to change its sign , utilizing pauli blocking to prevent the unwanted transformation of the remaining three basis states .",
    "our computed results indicate that by using three laser pulses a controlled phase gate with a fidelity exceeding 90% can be implemented on a time scale as short as 10 ps .",
    "the sample under study contains two vertically coupled saqds embedded in a schottky diode structure ( fig .",
    "1).@xcite the two vertically stacked self - assembled inas / gaas qds are separated by a thin gaas barrier such that the electrons or holes can tunnel between the two dots .",
    "the two qds have different thicknesses so that they have different optical transition energies . as a result",
    "they can be optically addressed separately with resonant laser frequencies .",
    "the nominal height of dot @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is greater than that of dot @xmath2 , @xmath3 , so that dot @xmath0 exhibits the lower transition energy .",
    "this allows the hole levels to be brought into resonance by adjusting the schottky diode voltage @xmath4 , while the electron level of dot @xmath2 is shifted to a higher energy than that of dot @xmath0 .",
    "this is a preliminary step and not part of the quantum information processing .",
    "2 shows the electron spin states and the lowest trion levels for each quantum dot.@xcite the qubit states are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , parallel or anti - parallel to the @xmath7 axis ( the growth and optical axis ) . the interband transition is to the trion state , consisting of two electrons in a singlet state and a heavy hole .",
    "the two trion levels are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote heavy hole states with spin @xmath12 and @xmath13 components along @xmath7 .",
    "optical selection rules dictate that the @xmath14 polarization could coupled the transition from @xmath5 to @xmath15 , and the @xmath16 polarization from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . here , we have neglected hole mixing and assumed that the in - plane magnetic field is zero  conditions to be relaxed later .",
    "among the entangling two - qubit quantum gates , one which is well suited for realizing with atom - like systems such as quantum dots is the phase gate .",
    "the ideal phase gate aims at a phase change in the basis state @xmath19 without affecting the phases of the other three states .",
    "it should also preserve the phase coherence of a superposition of the four qd spin states .",
    "this operation is a unitary transformation:@xmath20 we use the convention that the vertical arrows in the first and second kets are , respectively , the directions of the spins in dot @xmath0 and dot @xmath2 .    to obtain the two - qubit phase gate",
    ", we first use a @xmath16  polarized @xmath21 pulse to excite the dot @xmath0 spin down state to the trion state . after waiting for a time interval allowing the hole of the trion state to tunnel from dot @xmath0 to dot @xmath2",
    ", we apply a @xmath16 @xmath22 laser pulse to rotate the dot @xmath2 spin down state via its trion state .",
    "the pauli blocking given by the tunneling hole guarantees that only the @xmath23 state of the two spins undergoes @xmath22 rabi rotation , and acquires the @xmath24 factor , thus realizing a conditional phase gate . after allowing the hole tunnels back to qd @xmath0",

    "ideally , the same pulse does not cause the transition between @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 denotes the vacuum state ) because the excited energy difference between the exciton and trion @xmath47 makes this transition to be off resonance .",

    "a @xmath14  polarized laser pulse with rabi frequency @xmath86 has the hamiltonian @xmath89 where the factor of @xmath90 in the second term comes from the different weights of in - plane components of the valenceband wave functions .",

    "the effect of hole mixing is to slightly decrease the effective rabi frequency @xmath95 , and this can simply be compensated by a proportionate increase in @xmath86 .",
    "use of this new polarization therefore allows us to account for the effects of hole mixing and proceed directly as outlined in the previous sections .    in order to avoid the unintended excited transition @xmath96 caused by the ultrafast laser pulse @xmath97",
