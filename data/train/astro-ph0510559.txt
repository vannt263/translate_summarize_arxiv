    "_ planck _ is a european space agency satellite designed to produce high - resolution temperature and polarisation maps of the cmb .",
    "it possesses detectors sensitive to a wide range of frequencies from 30 to 857 ghz , split between two instruments the hfi and lfi , the high and low frequency instruments , respectively .",
    "_ planck _ will be inserted into a lissajous orbit around the second lagrange point of the earth - sun system , spinning about its axis once per minute .",
    "the line of sight being almost perpendicular to the spin axis , hence the detectors will almost follow a great circle .",
    "the spin axis will nominally be repositioned every hour , and the roughly 60 or so circles corresponding to a single spin axis positioning may be binned together to form a ring .",
    "the nominal spin axis passes through the centre of the solar panels and is directed away from the sun , thus maintaining the rest of the satellite in a cone of shadow produced by the solar panels .",
    "the scanning strategy is determined by the sequence of the nominal positions of the spin axis over the course of the mission .",
    "the geometric calibration is the process whereby all the line - of - sight positions of the detectors are recovered , at any time during the observations .",
    "the relationship between the pointing and time may depend on multiple parameters , discussed in full in @xcite ; here we discuss only those parameters which require calibrating with the science data .",
    "the remaining geometric - calibration parameters may be determined solely from the star tracker data",
    ".    the recovery of the geometric - calibration parameters has been investigated previously in @xcite and @xcite , which both use detections from point sources in the ring data to recover the geometric - calibration parameters during and post - mission , respectively . in this paper",
    "we investigate the recovery of the geometric - calibration parameters using the solar system objects , specifically the planets .",
    "additionally we show that it is possible to recover the focal plane layout , using the data corresponding to planetary transits .",
    "section  [ pointingrecon ] contains an overview of the pointing reconstruction of the satellite , in terms of the geometric - calibration parameters .",
    "methods to reconstruct these parameters and the focal plane layout from the detections due to the planets are presented in section  [ methods_section ] .",
    "the simulations used to assess the performance of these methods are described in section  [ simul_section ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ results_section ] , where it is shown that the geometric - calibration parameters and any offsets from the nominal focal plane layout may be recovered using the transits of the planets .",
    "the pointing reconstruction of the satellite is achieved by the use of a star tracker . however , the exact relationship between the reference frame which contains the star tracker and the satellite reference frame which contains the focal plane is uncertain .",
    "this relationship must therefore be established using the science data in order to meet the pointing accuracy requirements as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this may be achieved by the calibration of any offsets in the nominal values of the geometric - calibration parameters discussed below .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the reference systems and the attitude analysis may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( 10,7.5)(0,0 ) ( -1.5,9.75 )    the geometric - calibration parameters are defined to allow the reconstruction of the lines - of - sight of the detectors with respect to the spin axis position , given the layout of the focal plane with respect to a reference point .",
    "this reference point may be defined as the centre of the focal plane , and is henceforth referred to as the fiducial reference point , frp .",
    "the geometric - calibration parameters may then be defined by three angles , shown in figure  [ geo_fig ] .",
    "the boresight angle is defined by the angle between the spin axis and the frp , and the roll angle by the rotation of the focal plane around the frp .",
    "the reference phase defines the position along the reference circle , and is measured from a reference point defined by the intersection of the reference circle with the great circle connecting the spin axis position and the north ecliptic pole , nep .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the geometric - calibration parameters may be found in @xcite .    if the focal plane layout is uncertain then as well as the geometric - calibration parameters , offsets in the individual detector positions need to be recovered from the science data .",
    "these offsets may be expressed in terms of offsets in the nominal scan and cross - scan directions .",
    "the methods presented here are similar to those discussed in @xcite , the main differences arise from the fact that the positions of the planets are known to high precision . as previously , the geometric - calibration parameters are assumed to be constant over the time frame of a ring and possess a slow linear variation over the course of the mission .",
    "the instantaneous offset in a geometric - calibration parameter , @xmath0 , may be defined on each ring by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the current ring number , @xmath3 is the final ring of the mission and the ring numbers start from zero .",
    "the systematic offset in the parameter , @xmath4 , is hence defined as the instantaneous offset of the parameter exactly half - way though the mission and the drift in the value of the parameter , @xmath5 , is defined as the total drift in the value of the parameter over the course of the mission .    first the offsets in the reference phase and roll angle are extracted , then the offsets in the boresight angle .",
    "the geometric - calibration parameters values are then iterated over until convergence is reached , only then is the focal plane layout is recovered",
    ".      offsets in the reference phase and roll angle may be found from the differences between the observed and expected phases of the detections , where the phase difference for a detection is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the observed phase of the detection and @xmath8 is the expected phase for the detection .",
    "the expected phase of a detection on the @xmath9 ring in the @xmath10 detector may be calculated using : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angular separation between the position of the planet , ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and the spin axis position , ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , at the occasion of the @xmath9 ring , @xmath17 is the angle between the spin axis position and the nep and @xmath18 is the scan position of the detector relative to the frp .",
    "the phase difference for a detection on the @xmath9 ring in the @xmath10 detector , @xmath19 , may also be given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cross - scan position of the detector relative to the frp at the time of the observation .",
    "the systematic offsets and drifts in the reference phase and roll angles may hence be solved for using a non - linear least squares analysis .",
    "the ordinate , @xmath22 , of a detection may be defined by the angular separation between the scan circle described by the detector and the position of the planet , and may be expressed as : @xmath23 where @xmath12 is the angular separation between the planet and spin axis positions and @xmath24 is the angle between the line - of - sight of the detector and the spin axis position and is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the value of the boresight angle on the @xmath9 ring .    by accumulating detections from multiple rings , and hence fitting the cross - scan transit of the planet through the detector , the ordinate corresponding to the peak of the cross - scan transit may be found .",
    "this corresponds to the offset in the opening angle to this detector at the epoch of this planetary transit .",
    "the offset in the boresight is found for each planetary transit of the focal plane from the weighted mean of those offsets found for the detectors with the smallest beams , as in @xcite . in practice",
    "this means the detectors which belong to the top four frequency channels .",
    "the systematic offset and drift in the boresight angle may be found by a straight line fit to the value found for each instantaneous offset from each focal plane transit .",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 is the mean ring number of the detections corresponding to those used in the evaluation of the boresight angle at the epoch of the planetary transit .",
    "after the geometric - calibration parameters have been successfully recovered , the focal plane layout with respect to the frp may be extracted .",
    "an uncertainty in the focal length of the optics will produce offsets in the focal plane layout which scale as a function of the detector position relative to the frp .",
    "the offset in the position of a detector with respect to the frp may be expressed in terms of an offset in the nominal scan , @xmath29 , and in the nominal cross - scan , @xmath30 , directions .",
    "for each focal plane transit of a planet the offset in the detector position in the current scan and cross - scan directions are found .",
    "these may then be converted to offsets in the nominal scan and cross - scan direction using the value found for the roll angle at each epoch .",
    "@xmath31    the systematic offsets in the position of a detector may then be found from a weighted mean of the offsets found , in the nominal scan and cross - scan directions , for each focal plane transit .",
    "in order to assess the performance of the methods developed here in the reconstruction of the geometric - calibration parameters , it is necessary to simulate the planetary transits occurring during the _ planck _ mission .",
    "this requires an ephemeris and the brightness temperatures of the planets in the _ planck _ frequency bands as well as a scanning strategy and information on the beams of the _ planck _ detectors . throughout this paper",
    "we have made the simplifying assumption of gaussian beams .",
    "these methods , however , may be easily extended to non - gaussian beams , due to detector time constants or otherwise .",
    "indeed , the beam profiles used are intimately connected to the geometric - calibration parameters , changes in the definition of the beam profiles will affect the geometric - calibration parameters .",
    "hence , the geometric - calibration parameters are defined by the beam profiles used in their extraction .      while it is anticipated that this method will be applicable to any scanning strategy in which the circles corresponding to a single spin axis position may be binned together as a ring , only two potential scanning strategies for _ planck _",
    "were investigated here , a sinusoidal and a precessional scanning strategy .",
    "the sinusoidal scanning strategy may be described by : @xmath32 and the precessional scanning strategy by : @xmath33 where , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the position of the sun at the time the first ring , @xmath36 is the ring number , @xmath37 is the angular separation between subsequent spin axis positions , @xmath38 is the number of periods within @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the amplitude .",
    "the values of these parameters used here are @xmath37=2.5 , @xmath41=2 , @xmath42 , and @xmath40=10@xmath43 .",
    "this value of @xmath37 , given a repointing once per hour , keeps the spin axis directed away from the sun .",
    "an ephemeris code was written in order to evaluate the apparent positions and angular diameters of the planets as viewed from l2 , the orbit of _ planck _ about l2 is not included as this will not produce significant differences .",
    "the code uses the orbital elements available from jpl ( _ http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/elem_planets.html_ ) .",
    "planetary brightness temperatures from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite at far - infrared and sub - mm frequencies were fitted using a third order polynomial fit , as in @xcite , except in the case of mars in which a straight line fit is sufficient .",
    "the brightness temperatures thus found for each planet , in each of the _ planck _ frequency channels are shown in table  [ brightness_temp_table ] .",
    "these brightness temperatures may be used to calculate the expected flux of each detection due to each planet , given the angular diameter of the planet at the time of the observation as provided by the ephemeris data .",
    ".the brightness temperatures at each _ planck _ frequency , used in the simulations to generate the observed fluxes for the detections due to the planets .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the total error in the line - of - sight of a detector includes the error due to its recovered position relative to the frp .",
    "table  [ los_pointingerr_table ] shows the largest errors found in the line - of - sight of the hfi and lfi detectors , once the errors in the positions of the detectors relative to the frp are included .",
    "the geometric - calibration parameters and focal plane layout may be recovered with exquiste accuracy from the planetary transits of the focal plane .",
    "however , the transits of the focal plane by the planets are far from uniformly distributed in time .",
    "depending on the start date of the mission there may a period of @xmath44 5 months without a planetary transist and it is possible that this period may occur at the end of the mission .",
    "if the geometric - calibration parameters vary with time then even if this is only a linear variation , it may be necessary to confirm this variation using the bright extragalactic point sources , as in @xcite .",
    "an independent measurement of the geometric - calibration parameters may also be highly desirable in the case of an alteration to the scanning strategy , in order to improve the mapping of the beams of the detectors , when observing the planets",
    "this work was supported by pparc at the cambridge planck analysis centre ."
