    "research on the cosmic accelerating expansion from both observational and theoretical sides has been proceeding intensely for the past dozen years ( see  @xcite for reviews ) . within the framework of general relativity",
    ", the cosmic acceleration requires that the universe s current energy budget is dominated by a energy source , named dark energy , providing significant negative pressure density @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is its energy density .",
    "combined constraints from different types of current observation  @xcite@xmath7@xcite render the best - fit dark energy equation of state , @xmath8 with a few percent uncertainty , assuming w is constant .",
    "when dynamical @xmath9 is considered , its current value is still close to @xmath10 , with about @xmath11 uncertainty .",
    "this indicates that the cosmological constant remains the simplest valid realization of dark energy but there is still room for other possibilities .",
    "phenomenological studies on dark energy can in principle be categorized into two approaches .",
    "one is to reconstruct general properties of dark energy , the other is to constrain models on an individual basis . in the first approach ,",
    "the evolution of equation of state @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the redshift , for instance , can be reconstructed using either piecewise parametrization , continuous parametrization , or principal component analysis ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite for recent examples ) .",
    "the joint evolution of @xmath12 and its time - derivative in units of the hubble time , @xmath14 , can also be reconstructed in comparison with theoretical boundaries for various dark energy classes  @xcite .",
    "these studies render us general features of dark energy , yet the results may vary depending on the parametrization in use . furthermore",
    ", the reconstruction technique has been developed to provide diagnostics  @xcite and consistency tests for dark energy models  @xcite@xmath7@xcite . while these tests can in principle be taken to falsify models , we should be aware of the possible bias carried by the the chosen parametrization  @xcite .",
    "orthogonal but complimentary to the reconstruction is the model - based approach , in which we directly constrain the parameter space of a dark energy model using observational data ( see  @xcite for the case of pngb quintessence , for example ) . as the precision of observation advances , this approach is becoming effective .",
    "whereas robust and stringent constraints on model parameters can be obtained , a model s validity and its relative merit to other contending models can be evaluated via the goodness of fit ( gof ) and the information criteria .    in this paper , we take the model - based approach to confront the tracker field quintessence model  @xcite with observational data . in the quintessence scenario ,",
    "the late time cosmic acceleration is driven by a scaler field witch slowly rolls down its potential . as a class of quintessence model , the tracker field has an attractive feature that there exists a common solution to the equation of motion , extremely insensitive to initial conditions .",
    "this feature can address the cosmic coincidence problem , that is , the ratio of the dark energy density to the matter density must be set to a specific , infinitesimal value in the early universe in order to be of the order of one today .",
    "the data we use come from the latest type ia supernova ( sn ia ) compilation , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observation , and the observation of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) . besides constraining the model parameters",
    ", we assess the gof and the model strength in comparison with the cosmological constant model .",
    "in the quintessence scenario  @xcite , the late time cosmic acceleration is driven by a dynamical scalar field @xmath15 slowly evolving in the potential @xmath16 . in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ,",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is governed by its equation of motion @xmath17 where the dots denote derivatives with respect to time , @xmath18 is the hubble expansion rate @xmath19 ( a is the scale factor ) given by the friedmann equation @xmath20\\nonumber \\\\ & = & h_0 ^ 2 \\left [ \\omega_{r } ( 1+z)^4+\\omega_{m } ( 1+z)^3 +   \\omega_{\\phi } \\exp \\left ( 3 \\int_{0}^{z } \\left [ 1 + w_{\\phi}(z ' ) \\right ] \\frac{dz'}{1+z ' } \\right ) \\right ] , \\label{two}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the radiation energy density , @xmath22 is the matter energy density , @xmath23 is the scalar field energy density , @xmath24 is the hubble constant and @xmath25 is the equation of state of the scalar field . the total fractional energy density today @xmath26 is equal to one in a flat universe",
    ". the energy density and pressure density of the scalar field are @xmath27 @xmath28 the equation of state @xmath29 changes with time and becomes negative when the potential is dominant . in the limit",
    "when @xmath30 , the scalar filed has @xmath31 .",
    "tracker fields are a class of quintessence that address the coincidence problem . in these models ,",
    "a wide range of initial conditions in the early universe evolve toward a common solution , called tracking solution , giving the same late time evolution of @xmath15 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and allowing the scalar field to drive the cosmic acceleration .",
    "the central theorem in  @xcite states that tracking behavior with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the equation of state of the dominant background component , occurs for any potential in which @xmath36 ( the primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath15 ) and is nearly constant @xmath37 over the range of plausible initial conditions .",
    "the range of plausible initial conditions extends from @xmath33 equal to the initial radiation energy density @xmath38 in the early universe down to @xmath33 equal to the current matter energy density @xmath39 .",
    "this constraint is necessary for the scalar field to converge to the tracking solution before the present time .",
    "the feature @xmath40 means that @xmath41 decreases more slowly then the background energy density .",
    "eventually , at late time the scalar field density overtakes the matter density and becomes the dominant component .",
    "a class of potentials that satisfies the conditions that @xmath42 and @xmath43 is nearly constant includes the inverse power - law ( ipl ) potential @xmath0 , and combinations of ipl terms , for example @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the planck mass .",
    "some of these potentials are motivated by particle physics models with dynamical symmetry breaking or nonperturbative effects  @xcite@xmath7@xcite .",
    "the illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] exemplifies the tracking behavior and the late time tracking solution of these models .",
    "details of the tracker field property can be found in  @xcite .",
    "analytical solution to the ipl model has been studied in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the models exemplified in  @xcite , @xmath0 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "we also analyze the generalization of the last two , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "all @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are positive constant .",
    "both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are distinct from the cosmological constant without extra parameters being introduced . @xmath0 and @xmath48 behave like a cosmological constant as @xmath50 and @xmath51 approach zero , respectively .",

    "@xmath53 is set to be @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath41 starting from a wide dynamical range in the early universe all converge to the same tracking solution at late time .",
    "for all the three models , @xmath25 decreases in time at late time , the smaller the model parameter is the more negative value @xmath25 can reach .",
    "we use observational data from sn ia , cmb and bao as described below .",
    "we use the latest sne ia dataset , union2 compilations , released by supernova cosmology project which contains 557 sne ia in the the redshift range @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "this compilation includes supernova data from  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the dataset provides distance modulus which contains information of luminosity distance that can be used to constrain dark energy .",
    "the distance modulus is defined as following : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is hubble - free luminosity distance .",
    "we marginalize @xmath58 over the nuisance parameter @xmath59 by minimizing it with respect to @xmath59 .",
