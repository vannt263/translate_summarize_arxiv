    "the deposition of suspended particles onto a clean substrate is an important process in physics , chemistry , biology , and technology @xcite .",
    "adhesion of colloidal particles and proteins on substrates are just a few examples of numerous applications .",
    "a comprehensive description of the deposition process is very challenging as it requires the understanding of the evolution of a strongly interacting infinite - particle system . indeed , suspended particles diffuse and directly interact with each other through exclusion .",
    "additionally , the motion of suspended particles causes long - ranged hydrodynamic inter - particle interactions .",
    "further , the process of attaching to the substrate is also very complicated , the particles may rotate , the shape of the particles plays an important role , etc .",
    "even when the volume fraction occupied by suspended particles is very small and hence the inter - particle interactions in the solution are ignored , very little is known theoretically .",
    "it is therefore customary to maximally simplify the problem . following this tradition we focus on dilute systems , we ignore rotations and we consider particles of a few simple shapes . most studies also ignore diffusion .",
    "in contrast , our major goal is to probe the influence of diffusion of suspended particles .",
    "we therefore focus on the diffusion - controlled limit in which adhesion occurs instantaneously and diffusion plays the dominating role .",
    "the full treatment of the diffusion - controlled deposition problem is beyond the reach of analytical approaches , so we shall employ heuristic arguments .",
    "one particular situation amenable to heuristic treatment is when the particles are planar disks diffusing in a half - space above the flat substrate .",
    "disks are assumed to remain parallel to the substrate . whenever a disk touches the substrate",
    ", it irreversibly adheres to it .",
    "the overlapping of disks on the substrate is forbidden .",
    "the substrate eventually reaches a jammed state that can not accommodate additional disks .",
    "what fraction of the substrate is covered in the jammed state ?",
    "what is the temporal evolution in the vicinity of the jammed coverage ?",
    "are there correlations in particle positions in the jammed state ?",
    "some progress in answering such questions has been reached in the setting which totally ignores the diffusion of the particles in the solution .",
    "this framework is known as the random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) .",
    "the rsa model postulates that the deposition events are random : if the new particle does not overlap with already deposited ones , it sticks to the substrate ; otherwise , the deposition event is discarded .",
    "the rsa model has been introduced long time ago @xcite and it is fairly well - understood ( see @xcite for a review ) , although analytical solutions have been established only in the case of the one - dimensional substrate ( when disks become segments ) . for the rsa of disks the basic properties of the jammed state like the jamming coverage @xmath6 are unknown .",
    "the asymptotic approach to the jamming coverage is known @xcite , namely @xmath7 for the rsa of disks .",
    "this result admits a generalization to arbitrary dimension @xcite : @xmath8 for @xmath9 with jamming exponent @xmath10 for the rsa of disks onto the @xmath2dimensional substrate .    the rsa model is a single - particle process with memory .",
    "indeed , in each deposition event one particle is involved and the positions of already deposited particles are required .",
    "the diffusion - controlled deposition process studied below is a truly infinite - particle system . in the next sect .",
    "[ sec : add ] we show that for the adsorption of diffusing disks the asymptotic approach to the jamming coverage is also algebraic , and we determine the jamming exponent .",
    "we then analyze the diffusion - controlled deposition process when the diffusing particles are aligned planar squares ( sect .",
    "[ sec : adsq ] ) or spheres ( sect .",
    "[ sec : ads ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a short discussion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we emphasize again the basic assumptions of the diffusion - controlled adsorption of discs :    1 .",
    "disks freely diffuse ( no interactions ) in the solution and they remain parallel to the substrate .",
    "2 .   adsorbed disks do not overlap , do not desorb from the substrate , and do not diffuse on the substrate .    even for planar particles one can consider the general situation when they do not remain parallel to the substrate .",
    "furthermore , in the case of planar particles which remain parallel to the substrate , the analysis becomes more challenging when particles are different from disks .",
    "below we shall comment on these more complicated systems , but now we limit ourselves by diffusing planar disks irreversibly sticking to the substrate .",
    "in this section we argue that @xmath11 generally the jamming exponent underlying the adsorption of diffusing disks is given by @xmath12 when @xmath3 .",
    "the jamming exponent becomes infinite if @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the algebraic approach is no longer valid .",
    "( the disks are segments when @xmath13 , they remain parallel to one - dimensional substrate , diffuse in the two - dimensional half - space and adhere to the substrate upon touching it . )",
    "we shall argue that for @xmath13 the asymptotic approach to the jamming coverage is just slightly slower than pure exponential : @xmath14        let us first establish . around each adsorbed disk",
    "there is an exclusion zone ( its radius is twice that of the disk , fig .",
    "[ fig - ads - target ] ) .",
    "when a new disk from the bulk adsorbs , its center touches the substrate at a target zone .",
    "as the substrate approaches jamming , the target zones become small and almost all of them acquire triangular shapes ( more precisely , they have arcs - shaped sides whose radius is twice that of the disks , see fig .",
    "[ fig - ads - target ] ) .",
    "the separation between target zones grow indefinitely and in a jammed configuration there are no target zones . hence in the long time regime we can ignore the interaction between target zones .",
    "this greatly simplifies the determination the asymptotic behavior of the coverage and it was the chief idea of pomeau @xcite and swendsen @xcite in the case of the rsa model that led to with @xmath10 .",
    "this remains valid in our case , although the elimination of the target zones proceeds in a different manner .",
    "denote by @xmath15 the density of target zones of linear size @xmath16 . in the long time",
    "limit almost all target zones are very small , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the radius of disks .",
    "the density @xmath15 decays according to the rate equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath21 is the density of the disks far away from the target , and @xmath22 is a numerical factor . accepting we get @xmath23 in agreement with the announce decay law .    for the @xmath2dimensional substrate with @xmath3 ,",
    "an analog of is @xmath24 from which we deduce @xmath25    to understand and , consider a small isolated triangular target zone .",
    "( we emphasize again that the separation between target zones diverges and their sizes are small , @xmath17 , when @xmath26 . ) for dilute suspensions we can neglect the exclusion volume interaction between the disks .",
    "( in sect .",
    "[ sec : ds ] we outline extensions to dense suspensions . )",
    "thus we can treat the centers of the disks as non - interacting brownian point particles .",
    "the triangular zone is eliminated when a point particle touches it .",
    "we can disregard the reflection boundary condition on the substrate by considering a ` two - sided ' problem , namely a planar @xmath2dimensional target zone at @xmath27 in @xmath28 .",
    "the elimination of any target is described by reaction rate theory @xcite which expresses the decay rate through the diffusion coefficient @xmath20 , the density @xmath21 of the disks far away from the target , and the capacitance @xmath29 of the target .",
    "( a connection with electrostatics goes back to berg and purcell @xcite , see @xcite review . )",
    "when @xmath30 , so the ambient space is three - dimensional , the decay rate is @xmath31 .",
    "taking into account that our targets are planar and adsorption is possible only from above we conclude that the proper decay rate in our case is @xmath32 .",
    "reaction rate theory is applicable when @xmath3 and the general prediction for the decay rate of a planar target is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 $ ] is the area of the unit sphere @xmath35 in @xmath28 .",
    "the capacitance scales as @xmath36 where @xmath16 is the characteristic size of the target zone ( when all dimensions of the target zone are comparable ) @xcite .",
    "thus the decay rate is proportional to @xmath37 explaining and .",
    "the capacitance of the triangular target zone depends on its shape . for the disk of radius @xmath16 , for instance",
    ", the capacitance is @xmath38 @xcite , so the decay rate would be equal to @xmath39 if the target zone was the disk . generally for triangular target zones",
    "the decay rate is @xmath40 with a numerical factor @xmath22 of order unity depending on the details of the shape of the zone .",
    "the reaction rate theory is slightly different @xcite in the case of the two - dimensional ambient space ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the density @xmath15 of the target zones of length @xmath16 decays almost exponentially , @xmath41,\\ ] ] from which a more precise version of , @xmath42 \\quad\\text{when}\\quad d=1,\\ ] ] is obtained .",
    "to analyze the influence of the shape of the diffusing planar objects on the dynamics of the deposition process let us consider the deposition of aligned squares . in the realm of the rsa",
    "this problem has been extensively studied , see e.g. @xcite and reviews @xcite .",
    "we assume that the squares are identical , say of the size @xmath43 , and their attachment to the substrate is aligned with @xmath44 and @xmath45 axes .",
    "we treat the deposition process heuristically using the same approach as in the previous section .",
    "the target zones are now rectangles .",
    "long - lived @xmath46 rectangles have sizes smaller than the linear size of the square : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "crucially , long - lived rectangles tend to have a very large aspect ratio .",
    "the capacitance of an @xmath46 rectangle with @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "this formula gives a correct qualitative behavior even for @xmath51 .",
    "more accurate formulas were already known to maxwell @xcite and the work on this issue is continuing ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , but the above is sufficient for heuristic reasoning .",
    "the reaction rate theory tells us that the flux to the target zone scales as @xmath52 , so @xmath53\\ ] ] the coverage saturates according to @xmath54 this decay law is faster than the @xmath55 decay @xcite characterizing the asymptotic approach to the jamming coverage in the realm of the rsa of aligned squares .",
    "diffusing particles can have various shapes .",
    "the case of diffusing spheres ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spheres ] ) is especially interesting , a suspension of latex spheres is an obvious example .",
    "the adsorption of diffusing spheres has been modeled in ref .",
    "@xcite in the most relevant case of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath56 approach to the jammed state was predicted .",
    "this approach is faster than the @xmath57 approach characterizing the rsa of spheres , but slower than the @xmath0 decay law describing the deposition of disks in the diffusion - controlled limit .",
    "in this section we re - derive the @xmath56 behavior and show that generally for @xmath3 the jamming exponent is @xmath58        in one dimension , the exponent @xmath59 predicted by is correct , but there is also an additional logarithmic correction .",
    "we will argue that the decay law is @xmath60    at first sight , there seems to be no difference between adsorption of planar disks and spheres . in the rsa framework these two adsorption processes are _",
    "identical_. adding diffusion changes the situation ( figs .",
    "[ fig - spheres ] and [ fig - disks_ads ] ) . in the case of spheres",
    "we can still focus our attention on the deposition of the point particles , the centers of diffusing spheres , into target zones . however to reach the zone , the particle must go through the channel and reach its bottleneck .",
    "reaction rate theory implies that to compute the flux it suffices to replace the diffusion equation by the ( stationary ) laplace equation @xmath61 this replacement is justified in the case when the ambient space is three - dimensional ( more generally when @xmath3 ) . far away from the target",
    "@xmath62 the density must also satisfy the absorbing boundary condition on the target ( the bottleneck in fig .",
    "[ fig - disks_ads ] ) @xmath63 and the reflecting boundary condition on the boundary of the excluded region .",
    "this latter boundary is complicated ( see fig .  [ fig - disks_ads ] ) and random as it depends on the history of the deposition process .",
    "when the target zone is very small , however , i.e. @xmath17 , we can significantly simplify the problem .",
    "the passage through the very narrow channel is governed by an ` entropic ' barrier which provides the dominant contribution to the decay rate .",
    "( problems with entropic barriers are analyzed in numerous studies , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . ) in the channel depicted in fig .",
