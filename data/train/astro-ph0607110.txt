    "the discovery in 1998 of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) in coincidence with a very unusual supernova ( sn ) of type ic ( grb980425  sn1998bw ; spectroscopically identified ) was a turning point in the study of grbs , offering compelling evidence that long - soft grbs @xcite are indeed associated with the deaths of massive stars @xcite .",
    "the large energy release inferred for the supernova suggested that grbs are potentially associated with a novel class of explosions , having unusual properties in terms of their energy , asymmetry , and relativistic ejecta .",
    "more importantly , however , grb980425 provided the first hint that grbs might have an intrinsic broad range of energies : the total energy output in @xmath0-rays ( assuming an isotropic energy release ) was only @xmath1erg , some four orders of magnitude less energy than that associated with typical grbs @xcite .",
    "finally , the fact that grb980425/sn1998bw was located in a nearby galaxy with a redshift @xmath2 = 0.0085 ( @xcite ; at , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . ]",
    "@xmath5mpc it remains the closest grb to the earth ] gave rise to the possibility that such lower - energy bursts might be more common than had previously been thought , but harder to detect due to instrumental sensitivity .",
    "unfortunately , during the elapsed eight years , very few sne have been observed simultaneously with grbs . to date , three more nearby grbs have been unambiguously , spectroscopically identified with supernovae , two of which were discovered in 2003 ( grb030329  sn2003dh ; @xcite , grb031203  sn2003lw ; @xcite ) and one in 2006 ( grb060218  sn2006aj ; @xcite ) .",
    "each of these sne is of the same unusual type as sn1998bw .",
    "note , however , that there is weaker photometric evidence that many other grbs are accompanied by sne , mainly by identification of a late time `` sn bump '' in the grb optical afterglow lightcurve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we address only the four events with spectroscopically verified sn associations . among these , only grb060218 ( interestingly at 143.2mpc for @xmath6 , the closest after grb980425 ; @xcite ) had @xmath0-ray energetics somewhat comparable to grb980425 , and could possibly be added to the intrinsically - faint grb sample . in the case of grb030329 ,",
    "the total energy release was at the low end of the typical range ( @xmath7erg ) , much higher than in the other three events .",
    "in fact , sn2003dh was obscured by the extreme optical brightness of the grb afterglow and was only detected spectroscopically in the grb optical lightcurve . finally , the total energy release of grb031203 was intermediate between that of grb980425 and regular grbs .",
    "@xcite argued that the faint grb031203 was a typical powerful grb viewed at an angle slightly greater than about twice the half - opening angle of the central jet .    in the present study",
    ", we consider the energy released during the grbs , the afterglow , and the sn explosion for these four events in all wavebands , from @xmath0-rays to radio waves , and we also estimate their kinetic energy content .",

    "we performed here a broadband time - resolved spectral analysis of grb980425 , combining the lad and the wfc data , to better constrain the spectral parameters and their evolution during the burst .",
    "we used the high energy resolution burst data of the brightest lad for this event , with 128-channel energy resolution @xcite .",
    "this datatype starts after the batse trigger time , which corresponds to the beginning of interval a , as shown in figure  [ fig:980425_lc ] .",

    "however , since the wfc is an imaging telescope with a coded mask , all imaged data can be corrected for background without ambiguity .",
    "in addition to the background correction , the data were corrected for the detector deadtime as well as for the variations of the spectral response over the detector area .    to assure good statistics , we binned both the lad and wfc data into four time intervals ( a , b , c , and d in figure  [ fig:980425_lc ] ) ; two intervals each before and after the wfc lightcurve peak , similar to the ones used by @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data from both detectors jointly , using the spectral analysis software rmfit @xcite . since no significant signal was found above 300kev in all intervals ( @xmath11 detection in each interval ) , we obtained the best fits using the `` comptonization '' photon model @xcite : @xmath12 . \\\\\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 is the amplitude in photons@xmath14 , @xmath15 is the power - law index , and @xmath16 is the photon energy ( @xmath17 ) where @xmath18 peaks .",

    "the data are binned here for display purposes .",
    "no absorption correction was necessary in the combined lad - wfc fit of grb980425 .",
    "we used the published spectrum for grb030329 , and we extrapolated our best - fit model for grb031203 to the lower energy range shown here .",
    "for grb060218 the absorption correction was significant as seen from the comparison of the model to the xrt data below 10kev .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ep_dist ] we compare the @xmath71 peak energy , @xmath16 , of the same duration - integrated spectra , to the @xmath16 distributions of 251 bright batse grbs @xcite and 37 _ hete-2 _ grb / xrfs @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 values of the four events are lower ( softer ) than the average value of the bright batse grbs but they all seem to fit well within the _ hete-2 _ @xmath16 distribution . note that the batse @xmath16 distribution shown here is derived using the brightest batse grbs , which tend to be spectrally harder than dim grbs @xcite .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : ep_eiso ] , we show where these four events fall in the @xmath16-@xmath45 plane , in comparison to the empirical correlation ( dashed line ) found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "grb980425 lies farthest from the so - called amati relation .",
    "although grb031203 also lies away from the relation , this deviation could be the result of a viewing angle slightly outside the edge of the jet @xcite .",
    "in fact , we find a smaller lower limit on @xmath16 for this event than previously reported , so it is possible that , after correcting for an off - axis viewing angle , it would be consistent with the relation ( compare our figure 11 to the left panel in figure 3 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also note that for grbs  980425 and 031203 , @xcite have recently suggested two other possible scenarios that may cause such a deviation from the amati relation : one is that the grb radiation may have passed through a scattering screen , and the other is that we may have missed softer emission from the grbs lasting much longer . in both cases , observed spectra could have much higher @xmath16 values than the intrinsic ones .",
    "altogether , the four events do not appear to follow a specific pattern or correlation in the @xmath16-@xmath45 plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : hardness ] shows the hardness ratio evolution of all four events , in their source - frame time .",
    "the hardness ratio is defined here as the ratio of the energy flux between 50@xmath8500kev and 2@xmath850kev in the source - frame energy .",
    "the hard - to - soft evolution is seen in all events except grb031203 .",
    "the lack of spectral evolution in grb031203 is probably due to the fact that this burst was relatively dim and the observed energy range was fairly narrow .",
    "the burst was only detected below 200kev ( see figure  [ fig:031203_lc ] ) and the break energy seemed to always lie around or above this energy ; therefore , the flux above this energy may have been overestimated .",

    "the spectral parameters were then used to convert the count rates to the luminosity values .",

    "we used only the data from the _",
    "bepposax_/medium energy concentrator spectrometers and followed closely the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the only potentially significant differences between the current and the analysis of @xcite is that we estimated the background using the same observation , while @xcite used calibration blank - sky observations . as a result",
    ", we found slightly lower net count rates ( 1.6@xmath810.0kev ) during the two observations in april 1998 ( as compared to table 1 in * ? ? ?",

    "the count rates and exposure times for the remaining observations are consistent with @xcite .    to investigate the energy dissipation behavior in the x - ray afterglow",
    ", we fitted a natural cubic spline function to the @xmath78 history for each individual afterglow and estimated the cumulative emitted energy as a function of time . the evolution of the cumulative x - ray afterglow energy for all four events is shown in figure  [ fig : lx_cum ] .",
    "the integration time intervals varied from event to event , since the data time coverage was different for each event .",
    "we defined the integration time ( i.e. , `` afterglow '' time interval ) of each event to be from the earliest x - ray observation time ( @xmath85s ) to the time of the latest available data point . in the case of grb060218 , however , it was difficult to determine the starting point of the afterglow since the prompt emission was extremely soft and long and the x - ray follow - up started much earlier than in the other three events .",
    "it is possible that the steep decay observed before @xmath85 s ( see figure  [ fig : lx_time ] ) belongs to the decaying part of the prompt emission ; we , therefore , chose the afterglow starting time for this event to be @xmath86s , which corresponds to the onset of the break in its @xmath78 history .    to compare the cumulative energy evolution to regular grbs , we also show in figure  [ fig : lx_cum ] the cumulative energy evolution of the 10 _ swift _ grbs with known redshifts that were presented in @xcite . for these 10 events",
    ", we converted the @xmath78 values in 2@xmath810kev presented there , to the @xmath78 in the energy range we used for our four events here ( i.e. , 0.3@xmath810kev ) , using the same spectral parameters used in @xcite , and again , fitted a spline function to each @xmath78 evolution .",
    "the start and end times of the integration were the first and the last points of the actual observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : lx_cum ] shows that the final @xmath87 values for most of the 10 @xcite grbs span the range of @xmath88erg . out of the four sn - grb events ,",
    "only grb030329 falls within this range , while the other three events fall between @xmath89 and @xmath90erg .",
    "we note that there exists a selection effect based on the observed photon flux : an event would be more likely to be detected when it is closer to us than farther , for a given intrinsic luminosity .",

    "events that have large isotropic - equivalent energy ( both in @xmath0-rays , @xmath45 , and in the kinetic energy of their afterglow , @xmath95 ) have a large @xmath87 , indicating a reasonably narrow spread in the efficiency of converting the afterglow kinetic energy into radiation .",
    "moreover , they are typically associated with narrow jets .",
    "this means that most of their kinetic energy is in relativistic outflow carried by highly - relativistic ejecta ( with @xmath96 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , they have a relatively small @xmath91 ; the time at which most of the energy is injected into the afterglow shock , of the order of @xmath97s @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , events that have a small @xmath95 and small @xmath45 , naturally have a small @xmath87 .",
    "such events also tend to have most of their relativistic outflow energy residing in mildly relativistic ejecta , rather than in highly relativistic ejecta @xcite . as a result ,",
    "most of the kinetic energy is transfered to the afterglow shock at relatively late times , hence a large @xmath91 .",
    "further , since such events tend to be only mildly collimated , the _ true _ total energy in relativistic ( @xmath98 ) ejecta has a significantly smaller spread than the one of the isotropic equivalent energy ( @xmath45 or @xmath87 ) .",
    "we performed radio observations of grb060218 with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) ; these results are tabulated in table  [ table : radio - obs ] .",

    "the integration time of the radio afterglow emission is 1day to 100days after the burst trigger time , in the rest frame of the source .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : comparison ] , the isotropic equivalent energy that is radiated in the radio ( @xmath102 ) is @xmath103 orders of magnitude smaller than that in x - rays , @xmath87 .",

    "first , at @xmath107hr the x - ray band is typically above the two characteristic synchrotron frequencies , @xmath76 ( of the accelerated electron with minimum energy ) and @xmath108 ( of the electron whose radiative cooling time equals the dynamical time ) , so that the flux has very weak dependence becomes much stronger @xcite .",
    "] on @xmath109 and no dependence on the external density , both of which are associated with relatively large uncertainties .",

    "finally , the fact that the ratio of @xmath78(10hr ) and @xmath45 is fairly constant for most grbs , suggests that both can serve as a reasonable measure of the isotropic - equivalent energy content of the ejected outflow .",
    "figure  [ fig : lx_eiso ] shows @xmath78(10hr ) in 2@xmath810 kev rest - frame energy as a function of their isotropic @xmath0-ray energy release ( @xmath45 , in 20@xmath82000 kev ) for the four events , in comparison to regular grbs . a linear relation , @xmath112 , seems to be broadly consistent with the data , probably suggesting a roughly universal efficiency for converting kinetic energy into gamma rays in the prompt emission for these four events and those of  regular \" long grbs .",

    "this estimate is applied for the sub - relativistic flow , to avoid the effects of relativistic beaming and reduce the uncertainty on the geometry of the emitting region . since the source",

    ", the fact that these different energy estimates are consistent lends some credence to these models .",
    "some cautionary remarks are in order .",
    "the above calculation is only sketchy and should be taken as an order of magnitude estimate at present .",
    "for example , the usual assumption that at @xmath182 the flow is already reasonably well described by the newtonian spherical sedov - taylor self - similar solution , for which @xmath216 , is probably not a very good approximation .",
    "numerical studies show that there is very little lateral expansion of the grb jets while the flow is relativistic , and therefore it takes at least several dynamical timescales after @xmath182 for the flow to approach spherical symmetry . furthermore , since the flow is still mildly relativistic at this stage , there is still non - negligible relativistic beaming of the radiation toward the observer from the forward jet and away from the observer from the counter - jet .",
    "altogether , the flux is somewhat enhanced due to this mild beaming , and the fraction of the total solid angle that is occupied by the flow at @xmath182 is still considerably smaller than unity .",
    "consequently , this introduces an uncertainty of at least a factor of a few in the estimate of @xmath188 ; however , since the total energy is expected to be @xmath217 , it would still be at least a factor of a few larger than our estimate of @xmath188 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty on the dynamics of the flow should improve with time as more detailed numerical studies become available .",
    "another important uncertainty is in the determination of the non - relativistic transition time , @xmath182 .",
    "the better estimate of @xmath188 should become obtainable as more well - sampled afterglow observations are made , and the modeling gets more precise so that one can more carefully estimate both @xmath182 and @xmath218 . for grb980425 we related @xmath182 to the time at which the x - ray lightcurve steepens , which likely corresponds to the deceleration time of the mildly relativistic ejecta . for grb030329 , @xmath182 was selected to roughly correspond to the time at which the radio lightcurve flattens and at the same time to be consistent with estimates derived from direct size measurements of the event @xcite . in the other two cases ,",
    "only a crude estimate of @xmath182 can be made as it is unclear whether current observations clearly display a signature of the non - relativistic transition .      despite the wide range in energies in relativistic ejecta , and even wider range in @xmath45 , the total ( non - neutrino ) energy of the associated sn in all four events spans , at most , a factor of 10 .",
    "most of this energy is in non - relativistic ( @xmath219 ) kinetic energy : the integrated light of the sn is negligible . while not standard candles , the optical luminosities of the four sne at peak are all much brighter than average type ib or ic sne @xcite . since the brightness of type i supernovae at peak",
    "is given by the instantaneous rate of decay of @xmath220ni , the @xmath220ni masses are thus inferred to be in the range of @xmath221 .    to produce this much @xmath220ni in a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star requires a kinetic energy of at least @xmath222erg , even in lower mass wr stars @xcite . in higher mass stars ,",
    "a still greater energy is required for the lightcurve to peak within two weeks after the maximum .",

    "the important new development is that we now have significant observational support for the existence of a sub - energetic population based on the different amounts of relativistic energy released during the initial explosion .",
    "a network of theoretical tests lends credence to this idea .",
    "the existence of a wide range of intrinsic energies that we presented in this work may pose challenges to using grbs as standard candles  it is also worth stating explicitly that , when viewed together , these four events fall away from the amati relation .",

    "the central engine gives rise to a polar outflow with two components @xcite .",
    "one large angle outflow ( the sn ) , containing most of the energy and mass , is responsible for exploding the star and producing the @xmath220ni to make the sn bright .",
    "only a tiny fraction of the material in this component reaches mildly relativistic velocities , which is more narrowly focused . a second outflow component ( the grb jet ) occupies a narrower solid angle , probably contains smaller energy ( which can range from comparable to much smaller ) , and most of its energy is in material with relativistic velocities ( where the typical lorentz factor of the material that carries most of the energy in this component can vary significantly between different sn - grbs ) .",
    "after it exits the star , internal shocks within this jet and external shocks with the residual wind material around the star make the grb or xrf and its afterglow .",
    "apparently , the properties of the broad component are not nearly so diverse as those of the core jet @xcite .",
    "we have argued , using well - known arguments connected with parameters such as opacity and variability timescales , that these less - energetic events do not require a highly - relativistic outflow .",
    "our best estimates of lorentz factors , @xmath230 , for these events are in the range of 2@xmath810 . indeed , it is much more difficult to produce a jet with very high lorentz factor ",
    "i.e. , a high energy loading per baryon  than with low lorentz factor . a jet with low lorentz factor could result even if a jet of relatively pure energy is produced , since it may be loaded with excess baryons by instabilities at its walls as it passes through the star , or if it does not precisely maintain its orientation @xcite .",
    "the above suggest that grbs made by jets with lower lorentz factor should be quite common in the universe @xcite",
    ".    continued advances in the observations will surely yield unexpected revisions and additions in our understanding of grbs in connection with sne : currently , we are attempting to draw large conclusions from limited observations of exceedingly complex phenomena .",
    "however , the big surprise at the moment is that these sn - grb events appear to be intrinsically different from and much more frequent @xcite than luminous grbs , which have been observed in large numbers out to higher redshifts .",

    "<S> , we investigate the spectral and luminosity evolution , and estimate the total energy budget based upon broadband observations . </S>",
    "<S> the observational inventory for these events has become rich enough to allow estimates of their energy content in relativistic and sub - relativistic form . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a global portrait of the effects of the physical processes responsible for producing long - soft grbs . in particular , we find that the values of the energy released in mildly relativistic outflows appears to have a significantly smaller scatter than those found in highly relativistic ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a picture in which the energy released inside the progenitor star is roughly standard , while the fraction of that energy that ends up in highly relativistic ejecta outside the star can vary dramatically between different events . </S>"
