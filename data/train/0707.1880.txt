    "periodic variability of emission from cyg x-1 flux at various frequencies at the period of @xmath5150 d has been reported by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l06 ) .",
    "this period is much longer than the 5.6-d orbital period @xcite , and this type of periodicity ( or quasi - periodicity ) in binaries is called superorbital .",
    "the generally accepted interpretation of the underlying cause of superorbital periodicity in x - ray binaries is precession of the accretion disc and/or jet ( e.g.  @xcite ; l06 ; but with the exception of 4u 1820303 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the question arises in which way the precession causes the modulation of the observed flux .",
    "there appears to be a number of possibilities .",
    "considering the x - ray modulation first , the outer edge of the optically thick disc may partially cover the x - ray source .",
    "this , however , would require extreme fine - tuning . namely , the x - ray source has the size @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 ) , as indicated by the x - ray power spectrum and agreement with theoretical prediction on the range of radii where most of the accretion power is released , while the disc size is generally much larger , up to the order of the size of the roche lobe ( @xmath8 in cyg x-1 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the outer part of the disc fully obscures the x - ray source , but we see the x - rays scattered in a large corona above the disc ( this appears to take place , e.g. , in her x-1 , @xcite ) .",
    "this , however , would dramatically affect the x - ray power spectrum , removing oscillations at all frequencies above 1 hz , which effect is clearly not seen , and thus this scenario can be ruled out . the bound - free absorption in a spatially extended medium of moderate optical depth associated with the outer regions of the disc appears to be ruled out as there are a rather weak or no energy dependencies of the modulation , see l06 and section [ s : period ] below .",
    "( bound - free absorption in the wind from the companion is responsible for the _ orbital _ modulation of the x - rays in cyg x-1 , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a viable scenario is the wind / corona around the outer disc being almost fully ionized , with scattering away from the line of sight being responsible for the x - ray superorbital modulation .",
    "yet another possibility is that the x - ray emission is intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "such a possibility was considered by @xcite who have relied on the blackbody - type anisotropy , where the flux is proportional to the projected area .",
    "however , there is overwhelming evidence that the dominant radiative process producing x - rays in the hard state of cyg x-1 ( and other black - hole binaries ) is thermal comptonization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study models of the anisotropy of the comptonized emission to see whether they can reproduce the observed superorbital variability .",
    "we note that the hot comptonizing plasma most likely also forms the base of the jet , which is present in the hard state and radiates , at larger distances from the black hole , nonthermal synchrotron radio emission correlated with the x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the radiative process giving rise to the x - rays is still thermal comptonization .",
    "early models accounting for the radio - x - ray correlation postulated that the observed x - ray emission is due to nonthermal synchrotron emission of very energetic power - law electrons with a fine - tuned high - energy cutoff .",
    "however , that process can not account , e.g. , for the sharpness of the observed cutoffs @xcite .",
    "then , recent x - ray jet models turned to thermal comptonization to account for the high - energy cutoff .",
    "however , the electron temperature in that model is very high , @xmath94 mev @xcite , yet still fitted to the cutoff observed at @xmath5100 kev .",
    "those authors do not explain how it is done ; if it is due to the 1st order scattering by the thermal electrons , very strong fine tuning in all hard - states of black - hole binaries is obviously required . generally , assuming the jet x - ray origin also leads to a number of other conflicts with the observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the synchrotron , radio , emission of the jet may be isotropic in the comoving frame ( in the presence of a tangled magnetic field ) .",
    "however , if the jet bulk motion is at least mildly relativistic , the observed flux will depend on the jet angle , and will thus change with the jet precession .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that the absence of an observable counter jet requires such a velocity for the extended part of the jet .",
    "this constraint combined with one from the lack of radio  x - ray correlations on short time scales @xcite leads to the estimate on the jet velocity of @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "if the jet precesses together with the disc , the radio emission will be modulated with the precession period .",
    "on the other hand , we have no information on the velocity in the core of the jet , which can be in principle much lower . in that case",
    ", the process responsible for the radio superorbital modulation may be free - free absorption in the wind from the companion star , which will depend on the direction the jet is inclined .",
    "this may provide an alternative explanation of the superorbital modulation of the radio emission @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both the doppler beaming and precession - dependent absorption may take place in cyg x-1 .    here",
    ", we study the precession physical scenarios leading to superorbital modulations in a systematic way . in general ,",
    "any emission anisotropic ( in the rest frame of the system ) with respect to the disc / jet axis will be observed to be modulated when the direction of that axis changes .",
    "we use the x - ray dwell data from the all - sky monitor ( asm ) aboard _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also use _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "batse data in the 20100 kev and 100300 kev energy ranges , the 15-ghz radio data from the ryle telescope of the mullard radio astronomy observatory , and the 2.25 and 8.30 ghz data from the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) of the national radio astronomy observatory , green bank , wv , usa . see l06 for a detailed description of those data sets .",
    "compared to the analysis of l06 , we also include more recent asm and ryle data .",
    "we study the _",
    "rxte_/asm data for mjd 5008753789 ( 1995 may 12006 february 23 ) , the batse data for mjd 4837151686 ( 1991 april 252000 may 22 ) , the 15 ghz ryle data for mjd 5037753791 ( 1996 october 102006 february 25 ) , and the gbi data for mjd 5040951823 ( 1996 november 222000 october 6 ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the _ rxte_/asm channels of 1.53 , 35 and 512 kev as the asm a , b and c , respectively , and the batse 20100 kev and 100300 kev data as the batse a and b , respectively .    cyg x-1 is a highly variable source .",
    "therefore , in order to accurately analyze its superorbital variability it is preferable to use observations affected in the least way by its aperiodic variability .",
    "thus , we study only the hard state , in which cyg x-1 is for majority of the time .",
    "we define it following @xcite , requiring the average photon spectral index derived from the _",
    "rxte_/asm fluxes to be @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , we exclude hard - state intervals with high x - ray variability , following the criterion used by l06 .",
    "namely , we define mjd 5066050990 as our reference interval .",
    "we then include only those 30-d intervals of the asm data where @xmath13 per cent of points exceed by @xmath14 the average flux in the reference interval .",
    "this has resulted in removal of the following time intervals : mjd @xmath15 , 5059050660 , 5099551025 , 5140051640 , 5184051960 , 5210052565 , 5277052880 , 5297553115 , 5317453554 , @xmath16 .",

    "therefore , we have not applied any additional screening criteria to those data except the removal of the data marked as bad .",

    "furthermore , they found the phase of the superorbital also compatible with constant ( see fig .  7 and table 3 in l06 ) .    here",

    "we note that assigning errors to the folded and averaged fluxes is not a unique procedure . here",
    ", we first divide the light curve into time bins of the 1/20 of the period ( orbital or superorbital ) and obtain the average of the flux , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of the phase bin and @xmath34 is the number of the time bin contributing to the @xmath33-th phase bin , weighted by the inverse squares of their measurement error . in this way",
    ", we avoid any contribution to our folded / averaged light curves from the source variability on time scales shorter than that corresponding to the length of our chosen phase bin .",
    "the resulting measurement uncertainties on @xmath32 are rather small , and we neglect them .",
    "then , we consider the average and standard deviation of all time bins contributing to a given phase bin . here , we want to take into account the actual aperiodic variability of the source , not just the measurement errors . therefore , we calculate the unweighted average within the @xmath33-th phase bin , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of time bins contributing to the @xmath33-th phase bin , and the corresponding rms standard deviation , @xmath37 , given by @xmath38/ [ n_i(n_i-1)]$ ] . then",

    "the errors used in the fit are calculated in the way described above .",
    "the fits give us the amplitude of the variability , which we define as , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are , respectively , the maximum and minimum fitted fluxes , which ratio is @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . for our harmonic fit with @xmath30 , @xmath49 .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath50 are listed in table [ t : ampl ] .",
    "we see that the amplitudes of the superorbital modulation in both the asm and radio data are almost independent of the energy , confirming the previous result of l06 . on the other hand ,",
    "we confirm the result of l06 that the modulation amplitudes in the 20300 kev energy range are significantly smaller than those in the 1.512 kev range .",
    "two of the resulting superorbital phase diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sophase ] .",
    "we point out that the obtained amplitudes are somewhat affected by systematic uncertainties , in particular those related to the selection criteria .",
    "we have tested that indeed changing the criteria used to choose the fitted parts of the light curves results in some changes of the values of @xmath50 . to illustrate this effect , table [ t : ampl ] also gives the values of @xmath50 of l06 , who used both somewhat different selection criteria and different prewhitening method ( namely , prewhitening the data with all other significant modulations , not only the orbital one ) .",
    "we can see that their values differ from ours by typically 10 per cent , which can be taken as the systematic uncertainty of the values of @xmath50 .",
    "the largest difference is for the ryle data , which appears to result from not applying the selection criteria obtained from the asm data to the ryle data in l06 .",
    "also , we note that l06 treated each modulation as due to absorption , which lead to increases of the average fluxes after each prewhitening . in our method , we preserve the average fluxes , see equation ( [ eq : prewhiten ] ) .",
    "let us consider a precessing slab model with a constant tilt angle , @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "[ f : geom ] , and a constant angular velocity @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the superorbital period .",
    "then , the superorbital phase is proportional to time within each cycle , e.g. , @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "note that the precession is independent of the orbital motion of the system , i.e. , the disc inclination in an inertial frame does not directly depend on the orbital phase .",
    "the precession may also include any structure attached to the disc , e.g. , a corona and/or a jet .",
    "the angle , @xmath56 , between the normal to the disc and the direction towards the observer is given by @xmath57 where @xmath33 is the orbital inclination to the line of sight .",
    "here , @xmath58 corresponds to the disc being most inclined with respect to the observer .",
    "the emissivity of the disc ( and any additional structure , e.g. , a jet ) integrated over its surface and over the orbital period can be only a function of the direction with respect to the normal , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 varies between @xmath59 at @xmath58 and @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "we note that since no secondary maxima are observed in the x - ray folded superorbital light curves ( fig .",
    "[ f : sophase ] ) , we see only one side of the disc , i.e. , always @xmath62 , implying @xmath63 .",
    "otherwise , we would see at some moment only the disc edge and then its opposite side .",
    "note also that equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) is symmetric with respect to an exchange of @xmath33 and @xmath51 .",

    "note that if this model is applied to the jet case , the counter jet may be visible as well ( unless obscured by the disc and/or free - free absorbed in the wind , @xcite ) . in the counter jet",
    "is visible , a second term with @xmath80 replaced by @xmath81 should be added to the above expression for @xmath82 .",
    "\\(d ) @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the optical depth .",
    "this law corresponds to anisotropy caused by an absorber with the same symmetry as the disc .    using these models , we relate either the amplitude , @xmath50 , or the flux ratio , @xmath85 , to the model parameters .",
    "we assume @xmath86 , in which case the global flux minimum corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "for the case ( a ) , we have , @xmath88 in the case ( b ) , @xmath89 and @xmath90 note that in equations ( [ eq : b1][eq : b2 ] ) we have assumed that the flux monotonously decreases with increasing disc viewing angle , @xmath56 .",
    "this is generally the case for @xmath91 . if @xmath73 , the above formulae apply only in the range of @xmath92",
    "otherwise , the maximum flux is achieved either at @xmath93 or at the maximum value of @xmath56 of the precession ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) . in the former case",
    ", there will be two local minima of the flux , and in the latter , the minimum flux would be achieved at the minimum value of @xmath56 .",
    "both those cases can be ruled out for cyg x-1 .",

    "we also compare the resulting functions to @xmath136 , i.e. , the normalized case ( b ) of section [ s : analytic ] .",
    "we find @xmath137 as the closest overall approximation for the shown angular dependencies . on the other hand ,",
    "the normalized blackbody dependence equals @xmath138 , which yields less ( more ) emission than the normalized thermal comptonization dependencies at @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "we now use the dependence , @xmath82 , in an energy band together with @xmath141 of equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) to fit the @xmath142 observed in that energy band , with @xmath33 and @xmath51 as the fitted parameters .",
    "we use here the asm and batse data .",
    "( since the batse data are given as energy fluxes , we use the corresponding integrated energy fluxes for them . )",
    "this yields very good fits to all the data , e.g. , @xmath143 at the best fits to the asm a , b , c data , and the joint fit for all three detectors equal 9/17 , 11/17 , 13/17 and 34/57 , respectively .",
    "we have calculated the 90 per cent confidence contours for all the data , and found that they remain in excellent mutual agreement .",
    "we show the contours for the asm joint fit and for the batse a data in fig .",
    "[ f : models ] by the solid and dot - dashed curves , respectively ( the batse b contours are very similar to those of the batse a , except for extending to a somewhat higher value of @xmath51 at a given @xmath33 ) .",
    "this agreement provides a strong argument for the correctness of our model of anisotropy as due to thermal comptonization in a geometry similar to that of a slab .",
    "namely , we see in table [ t : ampl ] that the fractional x - ray modulation decreases monotonically with the increasing photon energy band , from 1.5 kev to 300 kev . in particular",
    ", the asm a channel shows the amplitude higher than that of the channels b and c , and the batse data show the amplitudes lower than those of the asm .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the theoretical anisotropy patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ f : anisotropy ] .",
    "namely , we see there that the degree of anisotropy of thermal - compton emission , as measured by the slope of the curves , decreases monotonically with the increasing energy ( for @xmath144 , which is satisfied in all of our fits ) .",
    "this effect is due to the average number of scattering in the plasma increasing ( thus leading to less anisotropic emission ) with the photon energy .",
    "this then leads to a corresponding decrease of the relative amplitude of the precessional modulation , which is both present in the x - ray data sets ( table [ t : ampl ] ) , as well it is very well fitted by our model .    on the other hand , we see the contours are very elongated , which results from a strong correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath51 in the model",
    ". the @xmath41 contours are only slightly smaller than the shown 90 per cent ones , indicating that the minima of @xmath145 are very shallow .",
    "therefore , in order to constrain @xmath51 , we use the constraint of @xmath146 ( approximately corresponding to the constraints on @xmath33 by various authors listed in section [ s : analytic ] ) , with the boundaries of this region shown by the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ f : models ] .",
    "then , we find @xmath147 at @xmath148 , and @xmath149 at @xmath150 .",
    "we then compare these results with the 90 per cent confidence contours for the radio emission as fitted with the jet model .",
    "we find that model is compatible with the comptonization model for the x - ray data if @xmath1510.5 ( shown by the dotted and dashed contours for @xmath151 and 0.5 , respectively ) , but not if @xmath152 . for @xmath1510.5 and @xmath146 ,",
    "the radio data provide constraints on @xmath51 less restrictive than the x - ray data .",
    "we show the best - fit asm a model and a model for the ryle data on the superorbital phase diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ f : sophase ] .",
    "the main caveat to our results here is related to using the slab model for comptonization .",
    "it is unlikely that the actual x - ray source in cyg x-1 has exactly this geometry , and it is probably less anisotropic .",
    "this would yield somewhat higher precession angles than those obtained by us , but it is unlikely to affect our qualitative conclusions .",
    "also , we have used a specific ( but rather typical ) single spectrum to obtain @xmath82 . however , though there is some spectral variability in the hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is aperiodic and its effect will be averaged out over a number of superorbital cycles .",
    "thus , using this assumption is unlikely to affect significantly our results .",
    "we have studied a general problem of how precession can affect the observed fluxes and spectra . apart from an obvious case of a full or partial covering of the central source by an accretion disc ( e.g. , in her x-1 , @xcite )",
    ", the observed flux can be modulated if the emission pattern of the precessing source is anisotropic .",
    "we have studied a number of likely anisotropy patterns , due to either intrinsic anisotropy of the emission pattern in the source rest frame , or doppler boosting of emission isotropic in the rest frame , or absorption / scattering by a corona covering the disc .",
    "we have derived formulae for the flux as a function of the precession phase for those processes .",
    "in addition , we have numerically calculated the x - ray anisotropy pattern due to thermal comptonization and compton reflection in a plasma with parameters characteristic to black - hole binaries in the hard state and assuming a slab geometry .",
    "we have then applied these results to the superorbital modulation of the 2.2515 ghz radio and 1.5300 kev x - ray emission of cyg x-1 in the hard state .",
    "we find that most models make similar predictions for the precession angle , i.e. , the tilt between the disc plane and the orbital plane , of the order of @xmath153@xmath2 .",
    "the statistical quality of all the models is similar , thus , they can not be distinguished on the basis of their @xmath145 . the model with absorption by a disc corona",
    "yields strongly anticorrelated the optical depth and the precession angle .",
    "our most physical model appears to be thermal comptonization for the x - rays and jet doppler boosting for the radio emission .",
    "the joint constraint to the x - ray and radio data yields for @xmath151 the values of @xmath154 , @xmath155 ; and for @xmath156 , the values of @xmath157 , @xmath158 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : models ] ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath159 ( from other observational constraints on the inclination , see section [ s : analytic ] ) , we obtain @xmath160 from the x - ray data , which then implies @xmath1610.5 using the ryle data .",
    "thus , both the disc / jet precession angle and the jet velocity in cyg x-1 appear relatively small .",
    "we also point out that our comptonization model also explains and well fits the decrease of the fractional superorbital modulation amplitude with the increasing photon energy observed in the 1.5300 kev x - ray emission of cyg x-1 .",
    "the decrease is explained by the comptonization anisotropy decreasing with the photon energy due to the correspondingly increasing average number of scatterings suffered by a photon before leaving the source .    finally , it is interesting to compare our results for cyg x-1 with those for the well - known precessing jet source ss 433 . in that case ,",
    "the jet velocity and the precession angle are very precisely determined based on the doppler shift of spectral lines ( formed in the jets ) .",
    "their values are @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "they are rather similar to those determined by us for cyg x-1 .",
    "however , the disc emission is not seen at all due to heavy obscuration , and the radio emission shows no periodic variability on either orbital or precesssional period .",
    "this appears to be related to the rather large inclination of ss 433 of @xmath164 , at which the disc / jet system goes through the edge - on orientation at some point of each precessional cycle .",
    "then , the counter jet is seen at a lower inclination than the primary jet during a part of the cycle , and both of them contribute comparably to the observed flux ( see section [ s : analytic ] ) .",
    "also , free - free absorption of the radio emission is of importance in that system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which introduces a major complication to predictions of the precessional variability given that details of the wind geometry are unknown . on the other hand , the precessional modulation is very significant in the x - rays @xcite , emitted by the jets .",
    "the disc / jet precession in ss 433 is probably caused by the precession of the companion star , with the rotation axis inclined with respect to the orbital plane ( see @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , this precession mechanism is unlikely in cyg x-1 , where the orbit is strictly circular @xcite , indicating that tidal forces have also brought the stellar rotation to alignment .",
    "then , the precession may be caused , e.g. , by the gravitational force of the star acting on the inclined disc ( e.g. , @xcite ; l06 ) .",
