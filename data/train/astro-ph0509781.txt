    "the chandra multiwavelength plane ( champlane ) survey is a comprehensive effort to analyze systematically and archive the results from deep ( 20 - 100ksec ) chandra pointings near the galactic plane ( @xmath2 12 ) .",
    "the primary science goals of champlane ( described below ) are to measure or constrain the low - luminosity ( 10@xmath6 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 ) accretion - powered x - ray sources in the galaxy : accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , neutron stars and black holes in quiescent low mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) and low - luminosity high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , primarily be - hmxbs .",
    "champlane is also enabling the first high - resolution search for isolated stellar mass black holes accreting from giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "a key secondary goal is the study of stellar coronal emission across the h - r diagram and in a range of galactic environments : from the anticenter disk to the galactic bulge .",
    "the survey will produce the most comprehensive database of coronal x - ray sources ( stars ) yet achieved , ultimately expanding the rosat samples ( e.g. schmitt et al 2004 and references therein ) by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude for stars in the plane and ( far ) beyond the solar neighborhood . while the primary goals of champlane are to survey and study point sources , the champlane x - ray and optical image archive also contain considerable rich diffuse emission which can be accessed for further study .",
    "champlane is also a major optical imaging ( v , r , i and ) followup survey conducted to identify optical counterparts of the x - ray survey sources .",
    "we have used the mosaic camera on the ctio and kpno 4 m telescopes in a 5-year _ long term survey program _ granted to champlane ( in 2000 ) by noao .",
    "the images and photometry from this survey , separately processed and archived at both cfa and noao , constitute some of the deepest   images of the plane in the 65 mosaic fields ( 3636 ) obtained in our noao survey .",
    "the champlane database at cfa links the x - ray and optical images and , when complete , will produce a legacy database for the distribution and nature of faint x - ray sources in the galactic plane . with initial analysis on 14 anticenter fields now",
    "nearly complete , the fraction of sources with optical counterparts is 50% .",
    "champlane is deeper ( given diffuse emission in many fields ) and of course has much higher angular resolution , permitting optical / ir identifications , than the xmm galactic plane survey ( motch et al 2003 ) , rosat all sky survey ( voges et al 1999 ) or the einstein galactic plane survey ( hertz and grindlay 1984 ; hertz et al 1990 ) . given that chandra is the premier high - resolution x - ray imager for at least the next decade , it is important to conduct the systematic analysis of the ( many ) chandra galactic fields to create the database needed for developing a statistical understanding of the accreting binary ( white dwarf , neutron star and black hole ) as well as stellar coronal x - ray content of the galaxy . an initial description of champlane and preliminary results for the derived source number vs. flux ( logn - logs ) distributions and source types was given for several galactic bulge fields by grindlay et al ( 2003 ) along with an initial description of the optical survey ( zhao et al 2003 ) .",
    "the x - ray processing is described in detail in the accompanying paper by hong et al ( 2005 ) , which presents x - ray results for the initial 14 galactic anticenter fields ( 90   @xmath7 270 ) .",
    "the optical survey and photometry pipeline processing for champlane is described in the accompanying paper by zhao et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "a broad overview of both the x - ray and optical survey status , as well as portals to the archived data and source catalogs , is available from the champlane website .",
    "champlane also incorporates an extensive optical spectroscopy followup program ( at wiyn , mmt , ctio and magellan ) and infrared ( ir ) imaging and photometry and ultimately spectroscopy .",
    "details are given in sections 5.2 and 5.3 .",
    "the champlane x - ray and optical surveys are now building , and releasing , significant x - ray and optical database archives of processed images and derived x - ray fluxes and colors and optical photometry .",
    "the optical database also includes photometry ( v , r , i and ) and astrometry results for the full stellar content of all mosaic fields acquired . the images and derived catalogs are released as initial science papers are submitted .",
    "we have developed tools for easy web access to the x - ray and optical images and derived products in the database .",
    "examples of these tools for x - ray and optical overlays are given in the appendix .",
    "we first summarize the key science objectives of champlane and the criteria for selection of chandra pointings for the survey .",
    "we then describe the x - ray processing and survey coverage obtained and then the optical - ir surveys and data products .",
    "finally , we derive initial constraints on the cv density and/or luminosity function from x - ray / optical results for the 14 fields processed for the anticenter . in the appendix we provide an overview of the x - ray and optical database content and online display and analysis tools now available from the champlane website .",
    "champlane uses chandra data from acis pointings , primarily acis - i , as this provides a larger contiguous field of view ( 16 16 ) , with exposure times of 20 ksec . a typical champlane field",
    "( see galactic distribution of champlane fields and histograms of key parameters in figures 1 and 2 ) has an absorption column with log ( n@xmath3 ) 21.7 . thus using pimms and an assumed power law spectrum with index 1.7 ,",
    "the limiting flux sensitivity for a 10 ct source in a `` typical '' 30 ksec observation is ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) = 5.7 10@xmath8 ^-2  s^-1erg  @xmath9",
    "s@xmath1(unabsorbed ) , yielding a distance limit for a source with ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) = 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1of d@xmath10 3.9kpc . for the deepest champlane exposures of",
    "typically 100ksec , and the same n@xmath3 , this increases to d@xmath11 7.1kpc , and for those extreme fields ( e.g. baade s window ) with both deep exposure and minimal log ( n@xmath3 ) = 21.3 , the limiting flux is = 1.3 10@xmath8 ^-2  s^-1erg  @xmath9",
    "s@xmath1(unabsorbed ) for `` limiting '' distance d@xmath12 8.2 kpc . the corresponding minimum luminosity for a more heavily reddened field with log ( n@xmath3 ) = 22.3 at d = 8kpc ( e.g. much of the galactic center region ) and",
    "a 100 ksec exposure with 10ct detection limit is ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) = 2.5 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "these values for limiting distance and guide the principal scientific objectives for champlane .",
    "_ cv number density : _ our first objective is to measure , or significantly limit , the number , space density and luminosities of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) in the galactic plane .",
    "current estimates of cv space density as 10@xmath4pc@xmath5 ( patterson 1998 ) are largely based on the small number ( 300 ) of cvs detected from optical ( variability or color ) surveys and may be uncertain by at least a factor of 10 ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "rosat surveys have shown that indeed the optical surveys are ( very ) incomplete ; a significant number ( 80 ) of cvs have now been identified in rosat fields , mostly with magnetic cvs ( schwope et al 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "determining the true cv space density and galactic population is important since this must connect to problems as fundamental as the rate of novae in the galaxy and the origin of sn ia systems ( e.g. townsley and bildsten 2005 ) as well as the population of lmxbs and cvs in the bulge that originated in globular clusters , either by ejection or cluster disruption ( grindlay 1985 ) .",
    "estimates of the cv space density from the einstein galactic plane survey ( hertz et al 1990 ) and rosat bright star survey ( schwope et al 2002 ) have both given 3 10@xmath4 3 .",
    "although the einstein / rosat cvs have reached farther than the optical surveys , none is more distant than , and very little is known about the cv space density in the bulge or radial distribution in the disk . extrapolating the local estimates , a typical acis - i champlane field",
    "might then contain 0.2 - 2 cvs .",
    "we derive predictions below ( table 2 ) , and compare them with preliminary results for 14 anticenter fields .",
    "the effects of n@xmath3 , assumed spatial distribution , cv x - ray luminosity function and x - ray / optical flux distributions make such predictions uncertain .",
    "no cvs have been confirmed spectroscopically as counterparts to chandra sources in these fields , whereas 1 might be expected given our discovery of 5 optically - selected cvs in the 5x larger area of the corresponding optical mosaic images . as also pointed out below",
    ", the fraction of optical counterparts from the mosaic imaging that have been spectroscopically identified in these anticenter fields is only 30% , so definitive cv measures are still to be derived .",
    "the space density of low mass x - ray binaries , with either black hole ( bh ) or neutron star ( ns ) primaries , is even more uncertain .",
    "the total number of bh systems in the galaxy is probably 10@xmath13 , as estimated from the numbers and recurrence times of bh x - ray novae ( tanaka and lewin 1995 ) .",
    "the number of lmxbs in quiescence , or qlmxbs , containing nss is even more uncertain yet a large population is indicated by the much larger population of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in the galaxy ( cf .",
    "yi and grindlay 1998 ) and population of faint transients in the bulge ( cf . heise et al 1998 ) .",
    "since both qlmxbs and cvs have x - ray luminosities typically 10@xmath14 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 , they are best discovered by a deep x - ray survey with flux sensitivity sufficient to detect these across the galaxy and positional resolution sufficient to allow unambiguous optical or ir identification .    the population of faint sources in the central cusp about sgra * ( muno et al 2003 ) may be dominated by wind - fed hmxbs , most likely quiescent be - hmxbs . alternatively as also proposed by muno et al",
    ", they may be relatively luminous cvs , most likely intermediate polars .",
    "our deep ir imaging ( jhkbr@xmath15 ) of the sgra * field ( laycock et al 2005 ) shows that the bulk of these sources do not have high mass companions with spectral types b0 or b1 as expected for be - hmxbs , and thus may be magnetic cvs . the nature and number of the bulge - cusp sources , vs. the galactic bulge and disk sources generally , are major objectives of the champlane survey .",
    "this has motivated our targeted program of deep pointings on three low - extinction windows progressively closer to the galactic center ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; these are reported separately .    whereas stellar mass bhs ( sbhs ) are now readily detected in binaries ( usually as transients in low mass x - ray binaries ) as hard x - ray sources , isolated sbhs",
    "should be much more numerous .",
    "agol and kamionkowski ( 2002 ) estimate there may be 10@xmath16 sbhs in the galaxy distributed in a disk distribution with scale height .",
    "if these are born with kick velocities much less than those derived for nss , as is plausible for sn ii core collapse models , they should be detectable by their bondi - hoyle accretion when passing through dense molecular clouds and gmcs . assuming only 1% gas - capture efficiency of bondi - hoyle accretion ( perna et al 2003 ) , and an additional radiative efficiency factor @xmath17 ( allowing for an adaf - like flow ) , the ( hard ) x - ray luminosity expected can still be appreciable .",
    "for a 10   bh with velocity v = 10 km s@xmath1 passing through a cold gmc ( with sound speed c@xmath18 v , so that ( v@xmath19 + c@xmath20))@xmath21 v@xmath13 ) with density n = 10@xmath22 3 , the accretion luminosity is    3.4 @xmath23 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1    where the @xmath24 , n , m and v parameters are scaled to the values given above . given the sensitivities above , this could be detected with champlane in a `` typical '' galactic bulge field , with n@xmath3   2 10@xmath25 @xmath9 , in a 100 ksec pointing .",
    "the challenge , of course , would be to identify ( in the ir , given the extinction in the bulge and the gmc , which alone gives n@xmath3   3 10@xmath26 @xmath9 ) the nature of such a source . with no binary companion",
    ", it should have an x - ray / ir flux ratio ( unabsorbed ) fx / f@xmath27 1 ( since the unabsorbed /l@xmath27",
    "> 1 for any re - processed thermal ir ) vs. fx / f@xmath27 0.1 for the x - ray to k band flux ratios for the bh - lmxbs groj0422 + 32 or a0620 - 00 .",
    "however , setting lower limits on k magnitudes will be difficult because stellar crowding in bulge fields limits k 16 ( laycock et al 2005 ) and thus isolated bhs in gmcs may be best identified by high resolution ( nicmos or ao ) ir observations of highly self - absorbed champlane sources , or in shallower but wide surveys of relatively nearby gmcs with less stellar crowding .",
    "be stars in binaries with ns companions ( only , thus far ) are perhaps the most numerous of the high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) in the galaxy .",
    "champlane is sensitive to the underlying population of quiescent be - hmxb ( qbe - hmxb ) systems ; those in outburst are obvious as bright transients . from the values for   given for qbe - hmxbs by van paradijs and mcclintock ( 1995 ) , and converting to conventional broad - band values , we derive log ( ) -2.5 @xmath280.9 for qbe - hmxbs which have mean = 10@xmath29 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "isolated be stars , on the other hand , should have 10@xmath30l@xmath31 10@xmath32 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1(for a b0v star ) and thus log ( ) -5.5 and so be readily distinguished .",
    "be - hmxb systems with bhs as the compact object are expected from binary and stellar evolution , and are another key goal of the champlane survey .",
    "neutron star accretors , as found thus far , can be determined by x - ray pulsation analysis ( all be - hmxbs known thus far are accreting pulsars ) although limited counting statistics makes this test possible only for the brightest sources .",
    "most soft galactic plane chandra sources are identified ( from positional matches ) as coronal emission from stars , primarily k , m and dme stars , but extending throughout the entire h - r diagram . with typically 15 coronal sources per field , the entire survey ( 100 fields ) should yield 1500 stars , with photometric spectral types constrained by color - color analysis ( cf .",
    "zhao et al 2005 ) and reddening constrained by x - ray colors ( cf .",
    "hong et al 2005 ) or actually measured for a significant fraction from followup optical spectroscopy .",
    "since champlane covers a wide range of the galaxy , from fields in the anticenter to the bulge , these will allow entirely new constraints on stellar coronal emission over a range of metallicity and stellar populations not possible before with rosat ( e.g. schmitt et al 2004 ) .",
    "champlane uses both acis - i and acis - s chandra pointings , which are imaging only ( i.e. no grating data ) , without sub - array or continuous clocking data mode ( which restrict the field of view ) and which meet the criteria :    1 .",
    "preferably acis - i , for the larger field of view nearly on - axis this enables ; 2 .",
    "exposure times nominally 20ksec ( though some , like the galactic center survey ( wang et al 2002 ) , are included with 12ksec exposures ) and galactic latitude @xmath2 12 ; 3 .   do not contain bright point sources or large / bright diffuse x - ray emission or extended clusters , which would systematically both limit sensitivity and contaminate survey fields with `` targets '' , and ; 4 .",
    "have minimal n@xmath3 , though this choice is rarely possible to make .",
    "these are primary criteria , in approximate priority order , used to select champlane fields and , in turn , to choose coordinates for the deep optical imaging ( mosaic ) for our noao - champlane survey . in a few cases ,",
    "we find a short observation ( 5 - 10ksec ) will be included within a mosaic field previously acquired .",
    "these are included to help in extending the survey areal coverage and thus sensitivity to bright sources in the plane with lower space density .",
    "the fields selected for cycles 1 - 6 are given on the champlane website , with their full parameters , and are shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 . the distributions of exposure time ,",
    "n@xmath3 , galactic longitude and latitude of the 105 distinct champlane fields chosen thus far are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in defining `` distinct '' fields , we have required pointing positions to be different by at least 4 , since this is a characteristic scale for appreciable degradation of on - axis sensitivity and also the scale of half an acis ccd .",
    "the additional 49 champlane pointings ( in the current total of 154 ) thus represent at least partial overlap fields , which allow significant new opportunities for time variability studies as part of the survey .",
    "champlane also includes the 30 fields observed by wang et al ( 2002 ) for their survey of the galactic center region .",
    "these are counted as distinct ( since their offset is 12 ) although in fact they overlap by 8and thus allow variability searches for bright sources moderately far off - axis .",
    "an overview of the current multiple exposure coverage , in galactic longitude vs. temporal coverage , is provided in fig .",
    "a `` typical '' champlane field is 30 ksec ( fig .",
    "2 ) exposure and contains 70 sources in each acis - i ( or acis - s , scaled for area ) field , with each source located to 1precision in the central 6(diameter ) field of view ( fov ) and to within 2even near the edge of the fov .",
    ".current vs. expected champlane coverage ( acis - i vs. -s ) [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     column headings are : chandra observation i d ( obsid ) ; target name ; galactic coordinates @xmath33 ; achieved exposure time ( ksec ) in acis - i or -s ; maximum column density n@xmath3   _ in units of 10@xmath25 @xmath9 _ from schlegel et al ( 1998 ) ; 3@xmath34 detection sensitivity limit ( unabsorbed ) in hc ( 2.0 - 8.0 kev ) band , averaged over field ; number of sources detected in bx ( 0.3 - 8.0 kev ) band over 4 acis - i or 1 acis - s chips ; range of limiting detection distance d@xmath35 and d@xmath36 for = 10@xmath37 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 ; corresponding expected number of x - ray cvs detectable ( cv@xmath35 and cv@xmath36 ) in effective volume out to distances d@xmath35 and d@xmath36 after scaling from = 3 10@xmath4 3 in the solar neighborhood ; corresponding range of r magnitudes expected _ at the typical extremes of _ , where r@xmath35 is r magnitude expected for = 10@xmath38 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1and log ( ) = -1 and r@xmath36 is for = 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1and log ( ) = + 1 .",
    "r magnitudes have been absorbed for the nh expected out to d@xmath35 and d@xmath36 as shown in fig . 6 for each field .",
    "thus the low 10@xmath38 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1cvs are expected primarily between magnitudes r@xmath35 and r@xmath35 + 5 , and typical cvs with 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1therefore between magnitudes r@xmath36 and r@xmath36 - 5 .",
    "c@xmath35 and c@xmath36 are the cumulative fractions of cvs at the corresponding magnitude limits that would be detectable with r 23 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , and id@xmath35 and id@xmath36 are the corresponding numbers of optically identified cvs expected .    as an initial check on the cv population and contribution to the champlane anticenter sources vs. agn and stars , we plot in figure 4 the   distributions for the sc(0.5 - 2.0kev ) band for the optically identified sources , along with the spectroscopically confirmed stars and agn ( rogel et al 2005 ) for a subset of these with 3@xmath34 flux measurements in the sc band .",
    "we use here the sc band for ready comparison with both the rosat cvs ( verbunt et al 1997 and schwope et al 2002 ) and the chandra high latitude survey , champ , population of agn ( and foreground stars ) in this same sc band .",
    "the total champlane optical source distribution of 324 of the 367 ids for which   values can be derived ( 43 have poorly determined r magnitudes ) is double peaked . from comparison with the spectroscopic samples , composed predominantly of stars ( left peak ) and agn ( right peak ) , the 131 sources with 3@xmath34 flux measurements in the sc ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) band are consistent with being 32% stars and 68% agn ( cvs and other accretion - powered galactic sources are also included , predominantly , in the hard peak ) .",
    "the 117 champ agn ( taken from green et al 2004 ) are overplotted in figure 4 ( dashed ) and have been reddened to the champlane n@xmath3values by dividing the champ sample into 14 groups with numbers of sources proportional to the relative source numbers nx in table 2 for the anticenter fields .",
    "each group is then reddened in both and for the n@xmath3   in that field , and a corrected   derived .",
    "the peak of the reddened champ distribution matches closely the right peak of the champlane distribution , further demonstrating that most are agn .",
    "however so does ( approximately ) the peak of the rosat cv distribution , which is unreddened ( most rosat cvs are nearby and have minimal n@xmath3 ) and lines up approximately with the peak of the ( unreddened ) `` raw '' champ agn .",
    "the cvs may differ from the agn in having a tail to lower values of   as well as a broader peak to higher   values .",
    "thus cvs , particularly magnetic cvs but also qlmxbs ( with both ns and bh primaries ) , with their flat bremsstrahlung continua , are often harder than agn in their   flux ratios .",
    "moving to the harder hc band also increases the contrast ( separation ) between the cvs ( and qlmxbs ) vs. stars . in figure 5",
    "we plot the log ( ) distributions for the 68 observed and unabsorbed ( for the full - plane n@xmath3 ) sources with 3@xmath34 fluxes in the hc band .",
    "the 5 source `` peaks '' at log ( ) -2 and -3 ( raw vs. unabsorbed , respectively ) include 3 stars confirmed spectroscopically so that , as expected , coronal stellar sources are almost gone in the hc band .",
    "thus , in table 2 , and the discussion that follows for initial constraints on cvs , we consider the hc band only .",
    "the apparant lack of bright   sources among the champlane anticenter source ids allows limits to be derived for the cv space density and/or x - ray luminosity function .",
    "we make the conservative assertion that of the 367 sources with optical counterparts , at most 7 could have ( r ) -0.3 or ew ( ) 28 , which allows rejection of dme stars ( see zhao et al 2005 ) but not agn for which emission lines can be redshifted in the   filter .",
    "we include even marginal   objects ( all are 1.42@xmath34 ) for a maximum limit , and without spectroscopic identification ( 5 were unobserved and 2 had insufficient counts for classification ) . since the sloan survey cv sample ( szkody et al 2004 and papers i and",
    "ii in this series ) find 17% of their 99 spectroscopically discovered cvs have ew ( ) 28 our photometric limits for champlane cvs could be increased by this factor ( 1.17 ) to 8 .",
    "thus a ( very ) conservative limit from the optically identified champlane anticenter sources is that 2% are cvs based on these   limits .",
    "the nearly - half of the anticenter source sample not yet identified optically , with absorbed log ( ) 1.2 but for which the unabsorbed limit is 0 , could allow additional cvs , though again the logn - logs results suggest these reddened anticenter sources are also dominated by agn .",
    "we now explore whether these limits , from 14 anticenter fields , provide interesting constraints on the cv number density . given the current estimates from rosat ( schwope et al 2002 ) and previously einstein ( hertz et al 1990 ) that x - ray selected cvs in the solar neighborhood ( 1 kpc ) are detected with space density 3 10@xmath4 3 , we derive the numbers expected in each of the 14 fields .",
    "given the estimated distances of the rosat cvs , their luminosities in the rosat band are peaked at ( 0.5 - 2.5kev ) 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 , with only 3 of 49 ( verbunt et al 1997 and schwope et al 2002 ) between 10@xmath39 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 . the 22 optically identified cvs detected by chandra in the deep survey of the globular cluster 47tuc ( heinke et al 2005 ) are distributed with a cumulative luminosity function described by either a power law , n(f(sc ) ) @xmath40 f(sc)@xmath41 or a lognormal distribution with mean log((sc ) ) = 31.2@xmath42 . for a `` typical '' cv spectrum ( e.g. a bremsstrahlung spectrum with kt 5 - 10 kev ) , the ( sc ) and ( hc ) values are comparable .",
    "thus for ( hc ) = 10@xmath38 and 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 , we derive ( table 2 ) the limiting detection distances d@xmath35 and d@xmath36 for each field using the ( maximum ) n@xmath3   values for each as derived from schlegel et al ( 1998 ) and given in table 2 .",
    "given the solid angle @xmath43 subtended by the full field of the acis - i or -s exposure , with @xmath44 = 16or 8 , respectively ( we use the full field , and in this simplified treatment do not allow for the off - axis decline in sensitivity ) , we then derive the volume in the disk over which cvs could be detected .",
    "we assume cvs are distributed in the disk with an exponential z - distribution ( warner 1995 ) for which we first assume a scale height h = 400pc , or comparable to that recently estimated for lmxbs ( grimm et al 2002 ) .",
    "we assume the radial distribution scale in the disk is much larger e.g. , 3.5 kpc , as for stars ) and can to first order be ignored in this initial treatment .",
    "we then derive the effective detection volume v@xmath45 for each field , using the same formalism adopted by schwope et al ( 2002 ) and tinney et al ( 1993 ) . assuming the cvs are distributed with a z - distribution as @xmath40 exp@xmath46 , the effective detection volume out to distance d is    @xmath47    where @xmath48 = d(sin @xmath49)/h .",
    "we derive this volume for the limiting detection distances d@xmath35 and d@xmath36 and thus the total number of cvs , n@xmath50 = v@xmath45 , given in table 2 as n@xmath35 and n@xmath36 .",
    "summing over the 14 fields gives a total of 2.3 cvs expected if their characteristic luminosity is = 10@xmath38 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1vs .",
    "53.1 for the = 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1   value . changing the assumed scale height to 200pc , as assumed by schwope et al ( 2002 ) , gives corresponding cv numbers 2.0 - 38.3 .",
    "additional limits are given below for a plausible x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) .",
    "we then estimate ( table 2 ) the range of optical r magnitudes these cvs would have for the range of log ( ) log ( ) -1  + 1 , typical for cvs ( hertz et al 1990 , verbunt et al 1997 ) .",
    "however since the optical counterparts for the cvs in some of these anticenter fields must be appreciably dimmed by the visual extinction , which in r is a@xmath51 = 4.2n@xmath52 , where n@xmath52 is the n@xmath3   value in units of 10@xmath25 @xmath9as given in table 2 , it is necessary to allow for extinction in the expected r magnitudes as a function of distance through the disk .",
    "we do this using the 3d dust model of the galaxy from drimmel at al ( 2003 ) .",
    "the drimmel model computes vs. d , but for these anticenter fields appears to underestimate the full - plane extinction as indicated by our logn - logs analysis ( hong et al 2005 ) , for which the schlegel et al ( 1998 ) full - plane n@xmath3   gives a better match to the extragalactic source number counts in the unabsorbed hc band .",
    "thus we re - normalize the drimmel values by the full - plane n@xmath3   predicted by schlegel et al and convert to a@xmath51 = 0.75a@xmath53 for the vs. d plot in figure 6 .",
    "this gives for distances d@xmath35 and d@xmath36 and thus the expected observed range of r magnitudes for cvs for the   and   ranges given in table 2 .",
    "finally , we estimate the fraction of the predicted x - ray cvs that should be identified ( `` easily '' ) with magnitudes r 23 in our champlane sample . we use the rosat distribution of   as plotted in fig . 4 ( and which we assume to be approximately the same as the   distribution , given typical cv colors ( v - r ) 0.3 ) , to derive the cumulative distribution shown in figure 7 .",
    "this gives the fraction of optical cvs vs. r magnitude relative to the r magnitude for log ( ) = + 1 since these are the _ faint _ optical limits , r@xmath36 and r@xmath35 + 5 , as given in table 2 .",
    "the cumulative optical identification fractions , c@xmath35 and c@xmath36 , of the x - ray cvs are read off the plot as the fraction value at the `` offset magnitude '' limits r@xmath36 - 23 and ( r@xmath35 + 5 ) -23 and given in table 2 .",
    "these fractions are then multiplied by the total predicted x - ray cv numbers ( cv@xmath35 and cv@xmath36 ) to give the predicted number of cvs ( id@xmath35 and id@xmath36 ) that should be optically identified for each field at r 23 for these characteristic values .",
    "the x - ray number counts for champlane sources in the anticenter ( hong et al 2005 ) suggest that , as found in a moderately deep chandra galactic plane survey of @xmath33 28.5,0   as well as asca galactic plane surveys ( ebisawa et al 2003 ) , at fluxes 10@xmath54 ^-2  s^-1erg  @xmath9",
    "s@xmath1the agn and extragalactic source distributions dominate stars and galactic sources .",
    "although the photometry of an `` example '' champlane field , groj0422 + 32 ( zhao et al 2005 ) , shows that most of the 40 optical counterparts ( out of 62 sources ) in this field have ( v - r ) and ( r - i ) colors consistent with their being normal stars , spectroscopy ( rogel et al 2005 ) of 33 of these counterparts showed that 14 are agn , 4 are stars and 15 were unidentified ( insufficient s / n ) .    we have conducted preliminary analysis of 14 anticenter fields to limit their cv content , and contribution from compact binaries generally .",
    "our initial analysis of the champlane anticenter cv limits suggests that the local space density of cvs may be overestimated by a factor of 3 relative to the 3   10@xmath4 3 value derived for the solar neighborhood from the einstein and rosat surveys .",
    "we derive this as follows .",
    "the rosat cvs are strongly peaked at 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 , so we first consider the limiting case for this .",
    "the much larger volumes in the disk ( and halo ) that can be reached with chandra than with rosat make it unlikely that the 38 - 53 cvs predicted in the 14 fields could be missed if they had local space density 3 10@xmath4 3 and x - ray luminosity function with characteristic 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "our conservative upper limit of 8 cvs out of 367 optical ids could then allow perhaps 14 cvs for the full sample of 631 sources from simple scaling , yielding a deficit factor of 2.7 .",
    "a stronger limit is obtained from the predicted number of cvs which should have magnitudes r 23 ( `` easily '' detected in our mosaic photometry ) , given our derived   distribution for rosat cvs : for cvs with characteristic 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 , some 26 cvs should have been optically identified from the champlane sources .",
    "this would suggest a factor of 3 deficit in cv density .",
    "since it incorporates `` known ''   flux ratios for cvs and the extinction vs. distance model ( drimmel et al 2003 ) for each field , it should be roughly independent of the fraction of champlane sources optically identified .",
    "champlane sources with r 23 are consistent with the   distributions and extinction for cvs with characteristic 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1   if 1   10@xmath4 3 .    allowing for a plausible xlf for disk cvs like",
    "that recently derived for cvs in the globular cluster 47 tuc ( heinke et al 2005 ) , for which we approximate an integral distribution n ( ) @xmath55@xmath56 for 10@xmath57 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 , steepening to index -1.3 for higher luminosities , and assuming a low luminosity cutoff at 10@xmath58 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 , then 0.22 of the sources would be detected with 10@xmath0 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "this would appear to suggest a reduction by this factor for the cv@xmath36 total from that in table 2 , or comparable to our scaled limit of 14 cvs .",
    "however , the extension of the xlf to larger increases the detection volume and thus cv number predicted . when combined with the addition of the larger number of lower   cvs , a deficit is still indicated . full consideration of the xlf as well as the the radial scale length of cvs in the galactic disk , e.g. 3.5kpc as for stars , will be explored in a more detailed analysis with the full champlane anticenter sample .",
    "our limits are relatively insensitive to the assumed vertical scale height ( h = 200pc vs. 400pc only reduces the expected cv numbers by 28% ) and are consistent with the overall cv space density 10@xmath59 3 for the solar neighborhood ( patterson 1998 )",
    ".    however the patterson ( 1998 ) estimate is dominated ( 75% ) by short - period cvs below the period gap with low and thus values 10@xmath38 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1expected . these can be detected in these champlane anticenter fields out to 1.5 kpc but the numbers expected ( cv@xmath35 in table 2 ) are small .",
    "additional fields in the anticenter can test this by probing a greater range of @xmath33 values as well as additional regions of low n@xmath3 .",
    "however the best measurements of the low cv population will likely come from our low - extinction windows ( e.g. baade s window ) in the bulge , for which analysis is in progress .",
    "conversely , the luminous ( 10@xmath60 erg  s^-1erg  s@xmath1 ) cv distribution may dominate the compact object distributions near the galactic center .",
    "ir imaging of the sources in the cusp around sgra * suggests that most are not hmxbs , but are consistent with being luminous cvs ( laycock et al 2005 ) .    with the much larger samples of champlane data from the full survey",
    "( these data represent 10% of the total , and cover just 0.6 square degrees ) , the cv and compact binary ( qlmxbs , be - hmxbs ) space density and luminosity functions will be possible to measure or constrain over galactic scale distances for the first time .",
