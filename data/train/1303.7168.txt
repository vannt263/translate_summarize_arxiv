    "the identification of an earth - like planet will have a great impact on astronomy and science in general . a growing number of discovered extrasolar planets are fostering anticipation for reaching the goal .",
    "indeed , several extrasolar planets , such as gj 667c c @xcite and kepler-22 b @xcite , are suspected of being earth - like on the basis of their orbit and mass / size .",
    "such discoveries have spurred a demand for a methodology for characterizing a candidate as earth - like . because the polarization spectrum of planetary reflected light contains physical and compositional information about the planet , the spectropolarimetry of extrasolar planets has potential to be a strong tool for characterizing a planet .",
    "ground - based polarimetry is advantageous because the degree of polarization is , in principle , not affected by telluric absorption .",
    "@xcite calculated the optical polarization spectra of light reflected by a modeled earth - like exoplanet .",
    "the model showed that the light reflected by an earth - like exoplanet can be highly polarized by light scattering in the atmosphere , and by surface reflection .",
    "single scattering generally produces higher polarization than multiple scattering or reflection from a rough surface .",
    "the degree of polarization in the continuum of the spectra studied by @xcite decreased with increasing wavelength .",
    "this was explained by an increasing contribution of surface reflection to the total planetary reflected light due to a decrease in the atmospheric absorption optical thickness .",
    "in addition , @xcite derived the presence of enhanced polarization features at gaseous molecule absorption bands , e.g. , the o@xmath3-a band ( 760 nm ) .",
    "the higher polarization was the result of a lower fraction of multiply scattered light ( and thus a higher fraction of singly scattered light ) in an absorption band as compared with the nearby continuum region .",
    "@xcite also examined the effect of cloud coverage and found that it reduced the polarization degree ; this was attributed to an increased fraction of multiple scattering .    different scattering or reflecting media exhibit different phase - angle dependences of the polarization .",
    "hence , the phase angle at which the maximum polarization degree occurs ( @xmath4 ) can be used to characterize exoplanets @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath4 is 90@xmath0 for molecular rayleigh single scattering @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath4 for a particulate surface can be larger than 90@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is known that the lunar ( airless solid ) surface has a @xmath4 of 95 - 110@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the earth , the only `` known earth - like planet '' , should be observed carefully in advance to facilitate the identification of an earth - like exoplanet .",
    "nonetheless there have been very few observational attempts to obtain the polarization spectrum of the earth .",
    "the satellite - borne instrument polder conducted polarimetry of the earth in three optical bands @xcite .",
    "however , its limited field of view ( swath : 2400 km ) should be accompanied by a challenge in reproducing the polarization of the disk - integrated earthlight , which can be used as a direct comparison with a distant ( and thus point - source ) exoplanet .",
    "we conducted spectropolarimetry of earthshine on the moon as an alternative approach .",
    "earthshine is earthlight reflected from the lunar surface .",
    "it is commonly used by ground - based observers to obtain the disk - integrated light of the earth because the spatial information in earthlight is averaged out in the lunar surface reflection .",
    "although photometry ( e.g. , @xcite & 2004 ; @xcite ) , regular intensity spectrometry ( e.g. , @xcite & 2006 ; @xcite ) , and monochromatic polarimetry @xcite of earthshine have been conducted ( as reviewed by @xcite ) , spectropolarimetry had never been reported until the recent publication of @xcite , who observed earthshine when the moon was at the waxing and waning quadratures .",
    "our observations were performed independently , and we successfully monitored phase variations in the earthshine polarization spectra .",
    "the results allow us to discuss both the wavelength and phase dependence of the polarization , namely the wavelength dependence of @xmath4 ; hence , they could provide more information than an observation at a single phase",
    ".    note that in this paper , the light of the earth as viewed from the space is referred to as _ earthlight _ , which is distinguished from _",
    "earthshine _ on the moon as observed from the ground .",
    "our observations were made on five different nights : 2011 march 9 - 13 ( ut ) .",
    "the moon waxed from a new crescent to the first quarter .",
    "the parameters of our earthshine observations are summarized in table [ tab : log ] .",
    "the earth phase angle @xmath6 , which is defined as the sun - earth - moon angle in this paper , ranged from 49@xmath0 to 96@xmath0 .",

    "the contributions of different earth scenes to earthshine are shown in table [ tab : surface ] .",
    "the cloud coverage was virtually constant throughout the observation period .",
    "the ratio of the contribution from the ocean to that from the land decreased from 1.05 to 0.51 .",
    "we used the spectropolarimeter hbs ( @xcite ) mounted at the cassegrain focus ( f/18 ) of the 1.88 m telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory , located in okayama , japan .",
    "the selected diaphragm was d2 , which has twin rectangular holes aligned in the east - west direction .",
    "their size is 0.2 mm @xmath7 1.4 mm each , which corresponds to 1.2@xmath8 @xmath7 8.5@xmath8 .",

    "an observational sequence consisted of moonshine ( ms ) , earthshine ( es ) , near sky ( nsky ) , and far sky ( fsky ) observations .",

    "for the ms spectra , the telescope was pointed to 12.9@xmath10 west of the moon s center .",
    "the use of ms is described in section  [ sec : reduce ] .",
    "then es spectra were observed at 11.3@xmath10 east of the center .",
    "nsky and fsky spectra for background subtraction were obtained by pointing toward the vicinity of the es , which was located at 20@xmath10 and 30@xmath10 east of the moon s center , respectively .",

    "the spectrum on 2011 june 10 ( @xmath16 ) by @xcite exhibits higher polarization degrees than their data in april and ours on march 12 - 13 .",
    "this can be attributed to differences in the scene types ( e.g. , cloud coverage ) in the earthshine contributing area ( sterzik et al .",

    "it has a peak height of 0.5%-1% , which is comparable to the statistical error in our data .",

    "this evaluation was based on a comparison of his optical polarimetric observations of earthshine with the roughly estimated polarization degree of earthlight , as well as on laboratory measurements of lunar samples .",

    "[ fig : compmodel ] shows the earthshine polarization spectrum observed on march 12 ( @xmath12 ) , compared with the stam s ( 2008 ) model spectra for four sets of the parameters .",
    "although both the observed and modeled spectra exhibit decreasing polarization degree with increasing wavelength , the model spectra do not match those based on the observation .",
    "@xcite made a similar analysis and also found considerable differences between their observations and the model . because the earthshine observations by the two groups are consistent , further model sophistication and/or re - examination of the lunar depolarization factor is expected to resolve this discrepancy .",

    "[ fig : es.p.all]f shows that the overall degree of polarization increases as the earth phase approaches quadrature .",
    "interestingly , with a more detailed look , the phase dependence appears to differ with the wavelength . to express this",
    ", we average the degree of polarization in the @xmath1 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 bands and plot them against the earth phase angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasep ] ) .",
    "the result suggests that @xmath4 ( the phase angle at which the maximum polarization degree occurs ) is larger for longer wavelengths : @xmath4 for the @xmath1 band is @xmath2 , whereas @xmath4 for the @xmath19 band seems to be larger than @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath4 varies depending on the type of scattering / reflection process . as described in section  [ sec : intro ] , the polarization of earthlight ( thus of earthshine ) is caused by scattering in the atmosphere and surface reflection .",
    "polarization from rayleigh scattering by atmospheric molecules has @xmath4 at 90@xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath4 for surface reflection can be larger than 90@xmath5 .",
    "the total light reflected from a particulate surface can be understood as the sum of three components : surface singly scattered rays , volume - scattered rays , and multiply scattered rays @xcite . because the volume- and multiply scattered rays are generally only weakly polarized , the primary source of polarization in the total surface reflection is the surface singly scattered light , which can be expressed approximately by the fresnel equations for specular reflection @xcite .",
    "typical refractive indices for soils , vegetation , and liquid water are @xmath151.55 @xcite , @xmath151.38 @xcite , and @xmath151.33 @xcite , for which the fresnel equations yield @xmath4 values of @xmath15114@xmath0 , @xmath15108@xmath0 , and @xmath15106@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "actual measurements proved that @xmath4 can be larger than 90@xmath5 for surface reflection : for soils , polarimetry of a terrestrial soil ( together with desert sand ) , the moon and mercury ( i.e. , airless solid bodies ) revealed that their @xmath4 values are roughly 100 - 110@xmath5@xcite , 95 - 110@xmath5 @xcite , and 93 - 103@xmath5 @xcite , respectively ; for vegetation , @xmath4 values of 90 - 120@xmath5 or beyond were measured by @xcite and @xcite ; for liquid water , a @xmath4 of @xmath15106@xmath5 was reported by @xcite .",
    "these estimates and measurements suggest that the earthshine polarization at shorter wavelengths is dominated by rayleigh scattering by atmospheric molecules , whereas that at longer wavelengths has an increasingly effective contribution from reflection at the land and ocean surfaces of the earth .",
    "indeed , considering the wavelength dependences of the scattering / reflectance processes , the fraction of the atmospheric rayleigh scattering in the total earthlight should be much larger at shorter wavelengths than it is at longer wavelengths : the rayleigh scattering radiance has a strong negative correlation ( proportional to @xmath21 ) , whereas the reflectances of soils and vegetation have generally positive correlations ; that of liquid water has a linearly ( i.e. , slower than rayleigh scattering ) negative correlation , according to the aster spectral library .    as additional processes for producing the observed wavelength dependence of @xmath4",
    ", we discuss the changes in scene ( ocean / land ratio , cloud coverage ) in the earthshine - contributing area on the earth during our observing period .",
    "since the cloud coverage was virtually constant throughout the observation period ( table [ tab : surface ] ) , it should not be effective .",
    "the ocean / land ratio decreased toward the end of the observations ( table [ tab : surface ] ) .",
    "as described , the estimated or measured @xmath4 for both liquid water and land ( soils and vegetation ) were typically greater than 90@xmath5 .",
    "hence , the @xmath4 of @xmath1590@xmath5 can not be explained without atmospheric rayleigh scattering .",
    "a decrease in the ocean fraction will increase the ratio of the surface ( ocean and land ) reflection to the atmospheric rayleigh scattering in the total earthlight because the land is brighter than the ocean , and thus may produce a larger @xmath4 .",
    "this effect should be more apparent at longer wavelengths , given the wavelength dependences of atmospheric rayleigh scattering ( strongly negative ) and surface reflection ( positive or weekly negative ) .",
    "hence , a decrease in the ocean / land ratio is at least qualitatively capable of producing the observed wavelength dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "note that this process is consistent with the interpretation described in the previous paragraph because the determining factor in both discussions is the same : the wavelength dependences of atmospheric rayleigh scattering and surface reflection .    to summarize the discussion of the observed wavelength dependence of phase variations in earthshine polarized spectra ,",
    "the results should be interpreted as an outcome of the wavelength - dependent ratio of atmospheric rayleigh scattering to surface reflection .",
    "earthshine polarization at shorter wavelengths is dominated by atmospheric rayleigh scattering , whereas that at longer wavelengths has an increasingly effective contribution from surface reflection .",
    "it is qualitatively possible that a decrease in the ocean fraction in the earthshine - contributing area was an additional process contributing to the observed wavelength dependence of the phase variation .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig6.eps      the polarization of earthlight , which is estimated from the earthshine polarized spectrum , has implications concerning the search for earth - like extrasolar planets . assuming a depolarization factor of @xmath153.3 at the lunar surface @xcite ,",
    "the polarization degree of earthlight should be as much as @xmath1530% at 450 nm and @xmath1520% at 850 nm when the earth phase is near quadrature .",
    "on the other hand , airless solid planetary bodies have a lower degree of the maximum polarization ; maximum polarizations of 6%-22% at 435 nm and 5%-9% at 840 nm were measured for the moon @xcite , and values of 9%-10% at 450 nm and 6%-7% at 850 nm were measured for mercury @xcite .",
    "our observations of moonshine are also within the ranges measured by @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that earth - like planets have significantly higher polarization than do airless solid bodies .    the wavelength dependence of @xmath4 , the phase angle of the maximum polarization ( subsection .",
    "[ sec : phase ] ) , may also be used as a signature of earth - like planets .",
    "for earthshine , and thus for earthlight , @xmath4 increases with increasing wavelength : @xmath4 in the @xmath1 band is a @xmath2 phase angle , whereas that for longer wavelengths appears at larger phase angles .",
    "in contrast , @xmath4 for airless solid bodies , namely , the moon and mercury , decreases with increasing wavelength ( @xcite ; fig.19 in @xcite ; table vi in @xcite ) .    finally , we compare our results with those for other types of terrestrial planets than airless solid bodies .",
    "venus , a terrestrial planet covered with thick atmospheric clouds , exhibits a completely different polarimetric behavior , which is explained by the mie theory for cloud particles with a refractive index of @xmath151.44 and a mean radius of @xmath15 1.1 @xmath22 @xcite : `` negative '' polarization ( i.e. , polarization in the direction parallel to the scattering plane ) is observed at most visible wavelengths and 30 - 140@xmath5 phase angles ; @xmath4 is located around 15 - 20@xmath5 phase angles in the 350 - 600 nm region @xcite .",
    "therefore , venus - like planets should be distinguishable from earth - like planets .    for mars , a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere",
    ", we can not access any near - full - phase polarimetric measurements in multiple wavelengths .",
    "@xcite presented polarization measurements by the spacecraft mars-5 at phase angles of 60@xmath5 and 90@xmath5 at a wavelength of 592 nm , together with ground - based observations for phase angles smaller than 43@xmath5 .",
    "the results generally resembled the polarization of the moon and mercury : the maximum polarization was extrapolated to be @xmath157% at a phase angle of @xmath15100@xmath5 .",
    "the maximum polarization of mars is significantly smaller than that of the earth .",
    "its wavelength dependence of @xmath4 is inferred to be similar to that of the moon , which has an opposite dependence to that of the earth .",
    "note that uncertainty in the lunar depolarization factor may affect the estimated polarization degree of earthlight .",
    "however , it does not affect @xmath4 ; the reason is that the depolarization factor at a certain wavelength should be conserved regardless of the earth phase angles because the earth - moon - earth angle is constant ( always zero ) .",
    "we conducted spectropolarimetry of earthshine for five earth phase angles ranging from 49@xmath0 to 96@xmath0 . the observed spectra exhibit a decreasing earthshine polarization degree with increasing wavelength at any phase .",
    "the overall degree of polarization increases as the earth approaches a quadrature phase .",
    "the observed phase dependence varies with the wavelength ; the maximum polarization for the @xmath1 band occurs at a phase angle of @xmath2 , whereas that for longer wavelengths is reached at larger phase angles .",
    "further observations at phase angles larger than 100@xmath5 are desirable to establish the exact @xmath4 at longer wavelengths .",
    "the observed wavelength dependence of @xmath4 is interpreted as indicating that the earthshine polarization at shorter wavelengths is dominated by atmospheric rayleigh scattering , whereas that at longer wavelengths has an increasingly effective contribution from the earth surface reflection .",
    "the wavelength dependence of @xmath4 for the earth appears to be unique among the terrestrial planetary bodies in the solar system .",
    "therefore it might be a signature expressing a distinctive characteristic of the earth : this planet has a scattering but transparent atmosphere above its surface .",
