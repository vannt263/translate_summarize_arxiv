    "we give in this paper a summary of our research program ( commenced in @xcite ) on the quantum statistical dynamics of relativistic particles moving in a quantum field .",
    "the relativistic particles are not coupled to each other explicitly but only through their interactions with a quantum field . because of this we need to take into consideration both the effect of each particle on the quantum field and the backreaction of the quantum field on each particle .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of the particle - field system dynamics is thus necessary .",
    "the backreaction from the field engenders _ nonlinear _ coupling amongst the particles , and _ non - markovian _ dynamics .",
    "we present a new approach to this problem which highlights the stochastic effects of noise , decoherence , dissipation , fluctuations , and correlations , and their interconnections .",
    "in @xcite we presented the basic framework built on the concepts of quantum open systems @xcite , the model of quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) @xcite , and the methodologies of the influence functional @xcite , closed - time - path ( in - in ) @xcite coarse - grained effective action @xcite , and world line quantization @xcite . in @xcite we applied this framework to spinless relativistic moving particles in a quantum scalar field , and derived the stochastic equations of motion , known as the abraham - lorentz - dirac - langevin ( aldl ) equations , for their trajectories with self - consistent backreaction .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the field are partially encoded as a stochastic noise in the aldl equations . the mean trajectory obtained from taking the stochastic average",
    "is governed by abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equations with modified coefficients whose time - dependence enforce causality .",
    "here we use the approach developed in @xcite to analyze a uniformly accelerated particle where the trajectory is self - consistently determined by its interaction with a quantum field ( this includes the effects of radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations ) .",
    "this important example illustrates the interconnections between radiation , radiation reaction , dissipation , quantum fluctuations , and the unruh effect .",
    "specifically , the uniform acceleration alters the quantum vacuum which in turn induces thermal - like fluctuations in the trajectory of a particle .",
    "this manifestation of the unruh effect in terms of fluctuating trajectories is in contrast to the original formulation and more common derivations @xcite , where a particle with internal degrees of freedom ( called a detector in the literature @xcite ) moving on a uniformly accelerating prescribed trajectory feels hot at the unruh temperature @xmath0 .    before delving into the technical details , in the remainder of this section we discuss the outstanding physical issues touched on in this work . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the relation of classical radiation , radiation reaction , vacuum fluctuations and quantum radiation , correcting the misconception of directly linking vacuum fluctuations with radiation reaction . in sec .",
    "3 we present the main structure of our approach based on the open system concept and the coarse - grained effective action techniques .",
    "we show the steps leading to a derivation of the ald - langevin equation for charges moving in a quantum field . in sec .",
    "4 we specialize to the case of a particle moving in a background field which imparts to it uniform acceleration on the average , and derive the unruh effect .",
    "we discuss how this example can serve as an analog for studying the stochastic dynamics of black hole event horizons . in sec",
    ". 5 we step back for a broader perspective and give some discussions of a ) the special features of this new approach and its potential in overcoming the stumbling blocks present in existing approaches ; and b ) applications of these results and directions for further development .      in this program of investigation",
    "we take a microscopic approach and an open - systems perspective , using quantum field theory as the tool to provide a first - principles derivation of moving particles interacting with a quantum field .",
    "we begin with the closed system of quantum particles and fields .",
    "a _ closed system _ can be meaningfully partitioned into subsystems if there exists discrepancies in the scales describing each subsystem , or in accordance to the physical scales present in their interaction strengths ( energy or time scales ) in relation to the probing scale or resolution accuracy .",
    "if we are interested in the details of one such subsystem ( e.g. , particle dynamics ) and decide to ignore certain details of the other subsystems ( e.g. , details in the quantum field configurations , such as correlations and phase information ) comprising the _ environment _ , the distinguished subsystem is rendered an _",
    "open system_. the overall effect of the coarse - grained environment on the open - system can be captured by the influence functional technique of feynman and vernon @xcite , or the closely related closed - time - path ( ctp ) effective action method of schwinger and keldysh @xcite .",
    "these are the initial value , or in - in , formulations suitable for following the time evolution of a system , in contradistinction to the usual in - out ( schwinger - dewitt ) effective action formulation useful for s - matrix calculations .",
    "for the model of particle - field interactions under study , coarse - graining the quantum field yields a nonlocal _ coarse - grained effective action _ ( cgea ) for the particle motion @xcite .",
    "an exact expression may be found in the special case that the particle and field are initially uncorrelated , and the field state is gaussian . the cgea may be used to treat the fully nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of interacting particles . however , when higher - order quantum corrections are suppressed by decoherence , the influence of the quantum fluctuations of the field may be encoded as stochastic noise , and the cgea can be transcribed into a _ stochastic effective action _ @xcite describing the stochastic particle motion . upon further coarse - graining , taking the stochastic average gives the semiclassical particle trajectory .",
    "let us analyze the physics of nonequilibrium processes for such particle - field systems at separate levels .",
    "* classical * level : from the complete quantum microscopic description of the system ( particle ) and the environment ( field ) , a classical description is reached when the system and environment are coarse - grained to an extent that both the particle and field histories are fully decohered @xcite .",
    "the fully coarse - grained trajectory for the particle with backreaction from the fully coarse - grained field then obeys classical equations of motion , such as the ald  equation .",
    "the coarse - graining length scale necessary to achieve full classicality typically far exceeds the length scale for backreaction pathologies like preacceleration and runaway solutions .",
    "* semiclassical * level : this is often defined as a classical system ( particles or detectors ) interacting with a quantum environment ( quantum field ) .",
    "it can be obtained from the complete quantum microscopic description by fully coarse - graining the environment ( the quantum field ) and finding the quantum average of the particle trajectory . in the special but important class when the field enters linearly in the particle - field interaction term , and without field self - interactions , coarse graining over the quantum field gives an exact cgea .",
    "the cgea yields the equations of motion for the system which in the leading order approximation is the semiclassical limit , followed by higher - order quantum corrections .",
    "in this particular situation , if decoherence can sufficiently suppress the nonlinear quantum corrections to the semiclassical equations of motion from the particle , then the semiclassical limit from the cgea agrees with the classical limit .",
    "* stochastic * level : going beyond a mean - trajectory ( or fully coarse - grained ) description of the particle , a stochastic component in the particle trajectory appears , as induced by the quantum field fluctuations manifesting as a classical stochastic noise counterbalancing the quantum dissipation in the system dynamics .",
    "the cgea may be transcribed into a stochastic effective action , encoding much of the quantum statistical information of the field and the state of motion of the system in a noise correlator for the particle .",
    "the stochastic effective action yields classical stochastic equations of motion for the system which embodies a quantum dissipation effect ( _ over and above _ the classical radiation reaction ) that balances the quantum fluctuations via a fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) .",
    "the classical theory of moving charges interacting with a classical electromagnetic ( em ) field , when the backreaction of the em field is included , has many controversial difficulties @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted classical equation of motion for a charged , spinless point particle including radiation - reaction is the abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation @xcite : @xmath1 ( see sec .",
    "ii for notations and definitions . )",
    "the timescale @xmath2 determines the relative importance of the radiation - reaction term . for electrons , @xmath3 secs , which is the time it takes light to cross the electron classical radius @xmath4 m .",
    "the ald equation is pathological . because it is a third order differential equation , it requires the specification of the initial acceleration in addition to the usual position and velocity required by second order differential equations .",
    "this leads to the existence of runaway solutions .",
    "physical ( e.g. non - runaway ) solutions may be enforced by transforming eq .",
    "( [ classical lorentz - dirac equation ] ) to a second order integral equation with boundary condition such that the final energy of the particle is finite and consistent with the total work done on it by external forces .",
    "but the removal of runaway solutions yields acausal solutions that pre - accelerate on timescales @xmath5 this is a source of lingering questions on whether the classical theory of point particles and fields is causal .",
    "there have been many efforts to understand charged particle radiation - reaction in the classical and quantum theory . to satisfy the self - consistency and causality requirements different measures",
    "are introduced to the underlying model .",
    "examples include imposing a high - energy cutoff for the field , an extended charge distribution , special boundary conditions , particle spin , and the use of perturbation theory or order reduction techniques @xcite .",
    "previous work closely related to ours include those on quantum langevin equations @xcite , and the application of the feynman - vernon influence functional to non - relativistic particle coherence @xcite and stochastic gravity @xcite .",
    "a major distinction of our work is the focus on relativistic systems , non - equilibrium processes , and nonlinear particle - field interaction .",
    "consider the situation where a localized particle at rest has some quantum fluctuations in its position just before an external force is applied at time @xmath6 , and where , by chance , the fluctuation is one that seems to anticipate the force creating the _ _  appearance _ _ of preacceleration . or , consider a situation where a quantum fluctuation produces the _ appearance _ of runaway acceleration for some period of time .",
    "while such specific fluctuations may be highly improbable to realize , they are among the set of fine - grained solutions in a sum - over - histories formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "these examples illustrate the observational challenges to distinguishing cause and effect on a fine - grained quantum scale .    why is there such a difficulty ?",
    "the underlying microscopic theory may be consistent ( though for field theory this may not be obvious ) and causal , in the sense that the operator equations of motion are causal , but the quantum state ( for particle or field ) is inherently nonlocal .",
    "observables ( expectation values ) of the particle motion involve both the operator equations of motion and the nonlocal quantum state , and thus the question of causality for trajectories requires more careful treatment .",
    "operationally , we do not observe fine - grained histories ; instead we observe coarse - grained histories where the coarse - graining scale is set by the measurement resolution in both time and space . with coarse graining ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations giving highly nonclassical trajectories are suppressed , and we therefore expect that a causal and consistent  quantum theory should yield , upon suitable coarse graining , a classical or semiclassical limit that is pathology free .",
    "this is an oversimplified sketch of a more elaborate theory @xcite based on the decoherent history approach to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting class of dynamics from the solutions to the ald  equation is that of a uniformly accelerated particle , defined by @xmath7 .",
    "this class of dynamics exemplifies many of the important issues under discussion .",
    "first , it follows from the ald  equations that the classical radiation reaction force vanishes despite the existence of classical ( lamor ) radiation registered as an energy flux at infinity .",
    "hence , there is no direct balance between radiation and radiation reaction .",
    "there is one existing belief that since radiation is associated with radiation reaction , the extra work done on the particle against the radiation reaction force must directly provide the energy that goes into radiation , but this is a static viewpoint that neglects the full interplay of particle , near field ( the so - called acceleration or shott field ) , and far field ( the radiation field ) dynamics .",
    "fields are dynamical entities with unusual properties ( such as nonlocality and field correlations ) much more complex than just radiation , which is a far - field definition , and energy can be attributed to a variety of sources other than radiation .",
    "for example , the acceleration field is known to contain energy and do work .",
    "one can not simply equate work done against radiation reaction forces with the energy ( instantaneously ) radiated into infinity . it would require a ` freezing out ' of the near - field s ability to exchange or adjust the form of its energy consistently in time to be commensurate with the far field behavior known as radiation .    during periods of uniform acceleration , the energy",
    "transfer  into radiation comes from acceleration fields , leaving zero radiation reaction .",
    "this is a special situation . during periods of nonuniform acceleration , there is radiation reaction , and one finds a mixture of field components ; but even then , the energy apportioned to radiation can not be instantaneously ascribed to work done against radiation reaction . on matters related to fields",
    "one should look carefully at the energy content locally and guard against making global statements .",
    "it has long been known that a uniformly accelerated detector ( uad ) ( a detector is defined as a particle with some internal degree of freedom ) coupled to a quantum field following a prescribed trajectory registers its quantum field vacuum as a thermal state with temperature @xmath8 this is the unruh effect @xcite , often cited as an analog of hawking effect @xcite .",
    "but there are important differences : in the case of a black hole , real radiation of thermal nature is emitted at the hawking temperature . for a uniformly accelerated detector ( uad )",
    "there is no emitted radiation associated with the unruh effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) except for a transient period when the charge is coming into equilibrium with its environment @xcite . for a",
    "uniformly accelerated _ charge _",
    "( uac ) there is of course classical radiation , but it is different from the unruh radiation , which is a distinctly quantum effect .",
    "we demonstrate below that for a uniformly accelerated charge interacting with a quantum field , the vacuum fluctuations induce stochastic fluctuations in the particle _ trajectory _ with a thermal character .",
    "we can refer to this as the unruh effect for charges , the role of the detector is played by the particle motion itself rather than an internal degree of freedom . in the semiclassical limit ( neglecting quantum corrections from the particle ) the _ average _ emitted radiation is the usual classical radiation : there is no additional net quantum  radiation from the particle .",
    "what is new and interesting in our finding is that there could be radiation associated with the stochastic component of the particle trajectory .",
    "for instance , these could conceivably generate fluctuations in the emitted radiation , perhaps with a thermal character , or they could produce other non - classical correlations in the radiation .",
    "this requires further investigation .",
    "it has been shown that for a uniformly accelerated detector on a fixed trajectory the field correlation is altered around the detector , but as these altered correlations fall off faster than radiation they can be considered as a vacuum polarization effect @xcite .",
    "similar vacuum polarization effects are also expected for a moving charge ( contrast this prediction with @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the radiation emitted by an evaporating ( shrinking ) black hole under non - equilibrium conditions is expected to have a non - thermal component @xcite over and above the usual thermal ( hawking ) part .",
    "we are using the analog with non - uniformly accelerated detectors or charges to investigate this issue @xcite .",
    "we begin with the full microscopic theory of a spinless charged particle interacting with a scalar field .",

    "<S> we present a stochastic theory for the nonequilibrium dynamics of charges moving in a quantum scalar field based on the worldline influence functional and the close - time - path ( ctp or in - in ) coarse - grained effective action method . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize ( 1 ) the steps leading to a derivation of a modified abraham - lorentz - dirac equation whose solutions describe a causal semiclassical theory free of runaway solutions and without pre - acceleration patholigies , and ( 2 ) the transformation to a stochastic effective action which generates abraham - lorentz - dirac - langevin equations depicting the fluctuations of a particle s worldline around its semiclassical trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the misconceptions in trying to directly relate radiation reaction to vacuum fluctuations , and discuss how , in the framework that we have developed , an array of phenomena , from classical radiation and radiation reaction to the unruh effect , are interrelated to each other as manifestations at the classical , stochastic and quantum levels . using this method </S>",
    "<S> we give a derivation of the unruh effect for the spacetime worldline coordinates of an accelerating charge . </S>",
    "<S> our stochastic particle - field model , which was inspired by earlier work in cosmological backreaction , can be used as an analog to the black hole backreaction problem describing the stochastic dynamics of a black hole event horizon .    </S>",
