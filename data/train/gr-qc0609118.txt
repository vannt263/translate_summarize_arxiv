    "the ligo and virgo gravitational wave interferometric detectors are approaching their design sensitivity @xcite,@xcite and in the near future , coincidences between the three detectors ( ligo - hanford , ligo - livingston and virgo ) will be possible . in order to reconstruct the direction of the astrophysical sources in the sky , it is well known @xcite that a minimum of three detectors is mandatory even if an ambiguity remains between two positions symmetric with respect to the plane defined by the 3 detectors .",
    "the source direction is also provided by the coherent searches for bursts @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or coalescing binaries @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where one of the outputs of the detection algorithm is an estimation of the source direction .    in this paper , we propose a method for estimating the source position using only the arrival time of the gravitational signal in each detector .",
    "the event detection is supposed to have been previously done by dedicated algorithms ( [ 10 - 23 ] for bursts , [ 24 - 29 ] for coalescing binaries ) and is not within the scope of this article .",
    "the direction reconstruction is based on a @xmath0 minimization as described in section ii .",
    "this technique can be easily extended to any set of detectors .",
    "moreover , the method can be applied to several types of sources ( burst , coalescence of binary objects ... ) as soon as an arrival time can be defined for the event .",
    "section ii also deals with the simulation procedure which will be used in the following sections to evaluate the reconstruction quality in several configurations .",
    "sections iii and iv describe the performances of the ligo - virgo network first neglecting ( iii ) , then including ( iv ) the angular response of the detectors . in section",
    "v , we consider the addition of other gravitational wave detectors ( supposing a similar sensitivity ) and investigate their impact on the reconstruction . in real conditions , systematic errors on arrival time are likely to exist and their impact on the reconstruction is tackled in section vi .",
    "within a network of _ n _ interferometers , we suppose that each detector @xmath3 measures the arrival time @xmath4 of the gravitational wave .",
    "of course , the definition of the arrival time depends on the source type and is a matter of convention , for example : peak value in the case of a supernova signal , end of the coalescence for binary events . in the following",
    ", it is assumed that all interferometers use consistent conventions .",
    "the error on the arrival time , @xmath5 , depends on the estimator used and on the strength of the signal in the detector @xmath3 , strength ( for a given distance and a given signal type ) which is related to the antenna pattern functions ( see @xcite and references therein ) at time @xmath4 . at that time , the antenna pattern depends on the longitude and the latitude of the detector location , as well as its orientation , the angle between the interferometer arms , the sky coordinates @xmath6 ( right ascension ) and @xmath7 ( declination ) of the source , and the wave polarization angle @xmath8 .",
    "the timing uncertainty @xmath5 can be parametrized by @xcite :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the measured snr in detector @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants depending on the detection algorithm and the signal shape .",
    "for example , a burst search with a 1-ms gaussian correlator leads to @xmath13 ms and @xmath14 .",
    "typically , for an snr equal to 10 , the error on the arrival time is a few tenth of milliseconds and weakly depends on @xmath12 for snr values between 4 and 10 .",
    "the @xmath15 measured arrival times @xmath4 and their associated errors @xmath5 are the input for the reconstruction of the source direction in the sky , direction defined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in the 3-detector configuration ,",
    "the angles ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) of the source in the detector coordinate system ( see ref.@xcite and @xcite for exact definitions ) are given by @xcite :    @xmath18    where d@xmath19 is placed at ( 0,0,0 ) , d@xmath20 at ( @xmath21,0,0 ) and d@xmath22 at ( @xmath23,@xmath24,0 ) .",
    "when performing a coherent analysis of the gw detector streams the position of the source in the sky is part of the output parameters , corresponding to the stream combination which maximizes the snr .",
    "however , for a burst search , it is known that thousands of possible positions have to be tested to obtain the solution @xcite , @xcite or a least - square function involving the integration of detector streams has to be minimized @xcite .",
    "this minimization also implies the test of hundreds of initial conditions in order to reach the right minimum .",
    "concerning coalescing binaries , it implies the definition of a five - parameter bank of filters including the chirp mass , the three euler angles and the inclination angle @xcite of the orbital plane or a three - parameter bank of thousands filters for the two source angles and the chirp time @xcite .    in all coherent techniques ,",
    "the extraction of the source direction is an heavy process imbedded in the detection procedure .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a simpler approach where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are found through a least - square minimization using separately triggered events obtained by a coincidence search .",
    "we suppose that the detection is already performed applying suitable algorithms ( matched filter for coalescing binaries , robust filters for bursts ) .",
    "the @xmath0 is defined by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the arrival time of the gravitational wave at the center of the earth and @xmath27 is the delay between the center of the earth and the i@xmath28 detector which only depends on @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the first advantage of this definition is that it deals with absolute times recorded by each detector rather than time differences where one detector has to be singled out . otherwise , the best choice for the reference detector is not obvious : the detector with the lower error on the arrival time , the detector which gives the larger time delays or the detector leading the best relative errors on timing differences ?",
    "this definition leads to uncorrelated errors on fitted measurements .",
    "the second advantage is that the network can be extended to any number of detectors and the addition of other detectors is straightforward .",
    "obviously , the method requires that the event is seen by all detectors .",
    "the least - square minimization provides the estimation of @xmath29 and the covariance matrix of the fitted parameters . when the number of detectors is greater than 3 , the @xmath0 value at the minimum can also be used as a discriminating variable , as the system is overconstrained .",
    "a list of coincident events are defined by the three arrival times and their associated errors .",
    "no detection procedure is performed in these simulations as stated before .",
    "the simulation proceeds in two steps in order to study two coupled effects : antenna - patterns and location with respect to the 3-detector plane .",
    "the first step is a simplified approach : the antenna - pattern functions are ignored and the same error @xmath5 is assumed for arrival times .",
    "the second step is more realistic : we assume the same sensitivity for each detector and the signal strength is adjusted to have the mean ( over the three detectors ) snr equal to 10 . however",
    ", this implies that sometimes , due to the antenna - pattern , the signal is seen in a given detector with an snr lower than 4.5 , which remains an acceptable threshold for a real detection . the same threshold equal to 4.5",
    "will be used later to see the effect of a reasonable detection scheme on the angular reconstruction error .",
    "we evaluate the errors @xmath5 for each arrival time @xmath4 using equation [ eq : sigma_t ] with @xmath14 .    for a given simulation ,",
    "the coordinates ( @xmath30 ) of the source are chosen and the true arrival times @xmath31 on each detector are computed taken @xmath32 equal to 0 ( it is obvious that the timing origin can always been chosen such as @xmath33 )    the measured arrival times @xmath34 are drawn according to a gaussian distribution centered on @xmath35 and of width @xmath5 .",
    "the simulated values @xmath34 are then used as inputs for the least - square minimization . as the minimization is an iterative procedure , some initial values for the parameters have to be given .",
    "@xmath26 is initialized by the average of @xmath34 . for the angles",
    ", it appears that the initial values for the angles have no influence on the minimization convergence and a random direction is adequate . in the case of three interferometers",
    ", it is well known that there is a twofold ambiguity for the direction in the sky which can lead to the same arrival times in the detectors .",
    "these two solutions are symmetric with respect to the 3-detector plane . in order to resolve the ambiguity ,",
    "a fourth detector is needed . for the evaluation of the reconstruction accuracy ,",
    "only the solution closest to the source is retained .",
    "in this section , we only deal with the ligo - virgo network and the effect of the antenna - pattern functions are not included and it is assumed that all detectors measure the arrival time with the same precision . as previously said , it allows to decouple the effect of the antenna - patterns and of the location with respect to the 3-detector plane .",
    "first of all , as an example , in order to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstruction , we choose a given position in the sky ( coordinates of the galactic center @xmath36 ) and we perform the simulation with @xmath37 s at a fixed time .",
    "the results are shown on figure [ fig : reco_pos ] .",
    "a resolution of about 0.7 degrees can be achieved both on @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the angular error is defined as the angular distance on the sphere between the true direction and the reconstructed one ( it does not depend on the coordinate system and in particular there is no divergence ( only due to the coordinate system ) when @xmath7 is equal to 90 degrees ) .",
    "this variable will be used in the following steps as the estimator of the reconstruction quality .",
    "the mean angular error is 0.8 degrees . as shown on table [ tab : covar ] , the estimated errors ( given by the covariance matrix ) obtained by the @xmath0 minimization are in perfect agreement with these resolutions .",
    ".reconstruction accuracies on @xmath6 and @xmath7 and errors given by the covariance matrix .",
    "three digits are given in order to show the adequacy between rms and errors given by the covariance matrix . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "all angular errors quoted previously suppose that arrival time measurements are only subject to gaussian noise .",
    "systematic biases can also be introduced by the analysis and their effect can be evaluated . in order to do so , we modify equation [ eq : t_measured_bias ] introducing a timing bias for only one detector :    @xmath38    as in sections [ source ] and [ including ] , we only consider the ligo - virgo network .",
    "it appears that the widths of the distribution for reconstructed @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not modified by the bias but the central values are shifted from the true ones .",
    "the differences between the reconstructed value and the true one are proportional to the bias and are significantly different from zero when the bias and the statistical error have the same order of magnitude .",
    "table [ tab : bias ] shows the effect of the bias for a given direction ( we check that the effect is independant of the source location ) . in this example , the bias has been applied to the livingstone interferometer .",
    "the width of statistical errors on arrival time was .1 ms leading to a statistical angular error about 0.8@xmath39 .",
    "for the tested configurations , we do not observe significant differences between the three interferometers of the network .",
    "we described a method for the reconstruction of the source direction using the timing information ( arrival time and associated error ) delivered by gravitational wave detectors such as ligo and virgo .",
    "the reconstruction is performed using a least - square minimization which allows to retrieve the angular position of the source and the arrival time at the center of the earth .",
    "the minimization also gives an estimation of errors and correlations on fitted variables .",
    "for a given position , the angular error is proportional to the timing resolution and the systematic errors ( if they exist ) introduce a significant bias on reconstructed angles when they reach the level of the statistical one .",
    "when the antenna - pattern effect is included and imposing a mean snr value of 10 in the ligo - virgo network , a precision of @xmath40 can be reached for half of the sky . in order to reproduce a realistic case",
    ", we apply a threshold on the snr in each detector ( snr@xmath1 4.5 leading to a false alarm rate about @xmath41 hz when performing a threefold coincidence ) .",
    "this condition is satisfied for 60 % of the sky and the median angular error in this case is @xmath42 . as a resolution of @xmath2",
    "is obtained for 30 % of the events satisfying the snr condition , it means that about 20 % of the whole sky is seen with an angular error lower than @xmath2 .",
    "adding other gravitational waves detectors allows to reduce the blind regions and to lower the mean resolution . in the best considered case",
    "( 6 detectors ) , the resolution is about @xmath43 and 99% of the sky is seen with a resolution lower than @xmath44 .    all quoted resolutions ( about one degree )",
    "are similar to those delivered by @xmath45-ray satellites when the first grb counterparts have been identified .",
    "so , we can expect it will be also sufficient for the first identification of gravitational wave sources ."
