    "the multiplicity of hadrons is the simplest global characteristic of the final state in particle collisions .",
    "it was an early conjecture that the main trends of the mean multiplicity and higher multiplicity moments could be reproduced by the corresponding perturbative qcd calculations for the quark - gluon cascade .",
    "first results have been derived for the asymptotic high energy limit in application of the double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) @xcite .",
    "taking into account the leading contributions from the collinear and soft radiation singularities and angular ordering @xcite one arrives at a probabilistic description of the parton cascade which evolves from the high energy scale @xmath7 down to the hadronization scale @xmath8 .",
    "the perturbative expansion in the coupling @xmath9 can be resummed and the exponent can be expanded into a power series of @xmath10 . in this way results on mean multiplicity @xcite and higher moments",
    "@xcite have been obtained , subsequently the next - to - leading log corrections in mlla @xcite and yet higher order terms @xcite have been derived .",
    "all these results can be obtained as different approximations to the mlla evolution equations for the generating function of quark and gluon jets @xcite .",
    "a full solution of these equations can be obtained by numerical methods @xcite .",
    "one motivation of such studies was  and still is  to find out how far one can extend perturbative calculations into the regime of real strong interactions which determine multiparticle production . in this way , we hope to learn more about the colour confinement mechanism .",
    "the mlla results on mean multiplicities and single particle spectra give a surprisingly good description of the data which led to the notion of `` local parton hadron duality '' ( lphd  @xcite ) .",
    "the results here depend on only two parameters , the qcd scale @xmath11 and a single non - perturbative parameter , the transverse momentum cut - off @xmath8 with @xmath12 ; an overall normalization factor @xmath13 is also allowed for .",
    "such parton level calculations have been applied to a large variety of inclusive observables , in particular to multiparticle correlations ( `` generalized lphd '' @xcite ) ; even quasi - exclusive processes are within reach @xcite . in general",
    ", one observes that with increasing accuracy , the perturbatively calculated observables are in better agreement with the data .",
    "this simple model does not contain any hadronic resonances , so it is clear that it can only describe sufficiently inclusive observables and should not be considered for too restricted regions of phase space ( for pertinent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "whereas there is no problem with inclusive single particle results , the status of higher multiplicity moments ( factorial moments @xmath14 and cumulant moments @xmath15 , see below ) , which are integrals over the respective @xmath2 particle correlation functions , is more controversial .",
    "the data on quark and gluon jets for @xmath16 @xcite deviate with increasing order @xmath2 from the higher order logarithmic approximations  @xcite ; they correspond to an expansion in @xmath17 rather than @xmath10 @xcite and the known terms fit the mean multiplicity ( moment @xmath18 ) but the moments of higher order become much larger than the data . on the other hand , numerical solutions of the mlla evolution equation yield very good agreement with these data @xcite ; remarkably , a common fit of hadron and jet multiplicities is possible and results in @xmath19 for a small cut - off @xmath12 where @xmath20 is the ratio of the total hadron to parton multiplicities .",
    "this ratio @xmath21 was also found to be consistent with the quark and gluon multiplicities in high @xmath22 jets observed at the tevatron @xcite where the higher order mlla corrections are taken into account as well .",
    "an interesting prediction @xcite from the asymptotic @xmath10 expansion concerns the ratio of moments @xmath23 these moments show an oscillatory behaviour with the first minimum at @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes the leading order multiplicity anomalous dimension at the considered energy scale , numerically @xmath27 at lep energies .",
    "such oscillations have indeed been observed in @xmath3 annihilations at slc @xcite and recently at lep @xcite with the first minimum at @xmath28 as expected .    since the absolute size of the moments",
    "are not in quantitative agreement with these high energy predictions the physical origin of these oscillations remains controversial .",
    "it has been noted that the truncation of the multiplicity distribution at large multiplicity , @xmath29 , also gives rise to oscillations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a superposition of two components ( like 2 and 3 jet events ) , each one modeled without oscillations , can lead to oscillations in the full sample @xcite .",
    "a new element has been brought into the discussion recently through analyses of the l3 measurements @xcite of multiplicity moments for hadrons and narrow jets at high resolution ( small @xmath4 parameter ) .",
    "the measurements feature a rapid variation of both the oscillation amplitude and oscillation length in @xmath2 as function of @xmath4",
    ". this behavior does not appear in the asymptotic solutions of the evolution equation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we aim at an understanding , within perturbative qcd , of the @xmath0 oscillation phenomena in both hadron and jet final states .",
    "we study first the solutions of the evolution equations ( both dla and mlla ) with jet hardness from threshold up to the asymptotic regime ; furthermore , we investigate the variations of the jet multiplicity moments with resolution , from low resolution ( fat jets ) up to high resolution ( narrow jets )  ultimately up to the scale for the parton - hadron transition .",
    "these calculations depend only on the qcd scale , @xmath11 , and on one parameter , @xmath30 , which refers to the transverse momentum cut - off .",
    "this transverse momentum cut - off is given by either the scale of the arbitrarily chosen jet resolution or the characteristic hadronic scale @xmath31 .",
    "the full results including the dependence on @xmath30 , are obtained by numerical methods . the need for an overall normalization factor",
    "@xmath13 is considered for the mean multiplicity .",
    "a similar theoretical scheme is realized in a parton level mc ( ariadne @xcite ) which is based on sequential parton radiation from colour dipoles @xcite with a @xmath32 cut - off .",
    "we have readjusted the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath8 in this mc to describe hadronic final states without an additional hadronization phase , assuming again a duality between hadron and parton final states at scale @xmath8 .",
    "the distribution , @xmath33 , of the multiplicity , @xmath29 , of particles or jets in an event can be characterized by its moments .",
    "one considers the factorial moments @xmath34 or the normalized moments @xmath14 @xmath35 with mean multiplicity @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , one introduces the cumulant moments @xmath37 and @xmath15 which are used to measure the genuine correlations without uncorrelated background in a multiparticle sample @xmath38 in particular @xmath39 ; for a poisson distribution @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "these moments can also be obtained from the generating function of the multiplicity distribution @xmath42    by differentiation @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes here some kinematic variable like the total energy .    in a high energy collision ,",
    "many hadrons are produced and they are found to cluster typically into jets of particles .",
    "the number of such jets depends on the resolution , which is defined through an algorithm in terms of a resolution parameter . in this paper",
    ", we choose the so - called durham algorithm @xcite . at resolution @xmath4 one",
    "combines particles into jets iteratively until all pairs of jets or particles have relative transverse momentum @xmath45 for small relative angles @xmath46 , or , in general , @xmath47 in our application to @xmath3 annihilation , @xmath7 is the total @xmath6 energy . at very low resolution ( @xmath48 )",
    "one sees only two jets which evolve from the primary @xmath49 system , whereas with increasing resolution more and more jets are resolved until at very high resolution ( @xmath50 ) all final state hadrons are resolved , so @xmath51 in this paper we study both the multiplicity of jets and the multiplicity of hadrons and the respective moments .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the variation of these observables with energy and resolution as has recently been reported in the experimental works @xcite .    in the popular monte carlo models of today ,",
    "the parton cascade is terminated at a scale of @xmath52 gev ; this perturbative phase is followed by the hadronization phase for which non - perturbative models , typically with a rather large number of parameters , are introduced . in our calculation",
    "we follow the idea of lphd @xcite and let the parton cascade evolve further down to a lower scale @xmath8 of a few 100 mev of the order of the qcd scale @xmath11 itself .",
    "then we compare the result directly to the hadron final state . in this way , besides the common parameter @xmath11 only one extra non - perturbative parameter @xmath8 is introduced which can be interpreted either as a typical hadron mass or as inverse hadron radius . in the theoretical calculations we obtain the hadronic final state for @xmath53 and we replace ( [ ycutlimits ] ) by @xmath54",
    "an important feature is the transition from jets to hadrons for small resolution parameter @xmath4 which tests the hadronization models in the region of small momentum transfers , the so - called `` soft '' region . in this paper",
    "the consequences of such an approach for multiparticle correlations in the soft region is investigated in the theoretical models and compared with the data .",
    "in this approximation we consider a single jet of particles or sub - jets at transverse momentum cut - off @xmath55 ; for @xmath3 annihilation , two jets have to be superimposed , with @xmath30 then corresponding to the resolution @xmath4 .",
    "only the most singular terms of the parton splitting functions are kept and recoil effects are neglected .",
    "then we can restrict ourselves to gluodynamics , i.e. we neglect the production of quark anti - quark pairs which would represent a nonleading contribution .",
    "a common simplification of these calculation is the restriction to 1-loop results ; furthermore , in this application we consider only light quarks . in this case",

    "one can also study the variation of jet multiplicity at fixed jet energy @xmath70 with resolution @xmath30 , as discussed previously @xcite .",
    "this dependence is given by the same function ( [ dlamult ] ) if the durham algorithm is applied ; in this case the cut - off in the evolution of the parton cascade is defined through the transverse momentum @xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding result is represented by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ hqdla - nf ] .",
    "one observes a considerably lower multiplicity by an order of magnitude , but , for decreasing @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) in the transition from jet @xmath74 hadron , the jet curve rises rapidly and reaches the curve for hadrons .",
    "this behaviour is a consequence of the running coupling , which is always smaller for jets , because @xmath32 , the argument of @xmath9 , is always larger .",
    "the analytic behaviour in this limit can be derived from ( [ dlamult ] ) using the approximation @xmath75 for small @xmath76 with small @xmath30 or large @xmath77 ( see also @xcite ) @xmath78 this multiplicity diverges logarithmically for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this divergence is a consequence of the diverging coupling in this limit .",
    "since @xmath81 , this divergence is outside the physical region , but a strong variation remains , as seen in fig .",
    "[ hqdla - nf ] .",
    "note that in the case of fixed coupling , the moments would only depend on the ratio @xmath82 as no other dimensional quantities exist ; then both curves for jets and hadrons would coincide and follow asymptotically a power law @xmath83 .",
    "next we calculate the factorial moments for @xmath41 . by appropriate differentiation of the evolution equation ( [ dlaevol ] )",
    "one finds for @xmath41 : @xmath84 where ( [ fmomeq ] ) follows from ( [ init ] ) and ( [ fkgen ] ) , in agreement with ( [ fmom ] ) .",

    "there was good agreement to within @xmath86 . reducing the step size by a factor of 10 ( @xmath87 ) , resulted in a change of about 1% in the value of @xmath88 and a change in the ratio @xmath89 by 0.1% below in the range considered .",
    "a selection of results on the normalized moments @xmath14 is also shown in fig .  [ hqdla - nf ] .",
    "the moments @xmath14 for @xmath41 vanish at threshold @xmath61 . shortly above threshold",

    "an intesting feature of these ratios is their asymptotic decrease with rank @xmath2 @xcite @xmath93    this behaviour can be derived easily in leading order of @xmath94 under the assumption of constant @xmath15 and @xmath14 from the equation @xmath95 , which follows from ( [ fkgen ] ) and ( [ dlaevol ] ) using ( [ neqn ] ) .    on the other hand ,",

    "this appears plausible from the point of view of kno scaling .",
    "we note that the moments presented by the sld collaboration @xcite have been determined from the multiplicity range @xmath236 and they look very similar to the truncated l3 moments .",
    "we stress that from our point of view the untruncated moments are of primary relevance ; only these obey the evolution equations discussed above and have simple asymptotic properties . beyond the first minimum they are very small at lep energies , of the order of @xmath237 .    finally , in the same fig .",
    "[ l3oscillations ] we study the evolution of the @xmath0 moments with cut - off @xmath30 or @xmath199 .",

    "2.5 m events have been generated in the mc .",
    "for all orders @xmath2 , the calculation follows the experimental data closely .",

    "the distribution is narrower than poisson ( @xmath239 ) , while at higher values of this ratio the distribution gets broader ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "the positive @xmath0 is expected from the short range correlations , either from gluon bremsstrahlung at small angles for partons or from resonance decays for hadrons . at the point with @xmath240",
    "the higher moments are also close to zero corresponding to a poissonian transition point , both for jets and hadrons : @xmath241 it is interesting to note that the poissonian distribution has actually been successfully fit to their data at 29 gev by the hrs collaboration @xcite .    we observe again a close similarity between mc and mlla results , although the deviations from a poissonian ( @xmath242 at minimum ) appear a bit larger in the mc .",
    "we have studied the multiplicity moments , in particular the @xmath0 ratios for the qcd parton cascade in three different approximations : dla , mlla and parton monte carlo .",
    "the dla predicts the very asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the asymptotic mlla corrections predict the existence of @xmath0 oscillations , but do not explain any @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the more precise calculations of the full mlla solution of the evolution equations and the monte carlo method , which include the correct threshold behaviour , show at the presently accessible energies the following new features of the multiplicity moments :    * there is a particular energy scale , @xmath174 , for hadrons or a particular @xmath4 for jets where the multiplicity distribution is approximately poissonian ( @xmath243 for @xmath41 ) . * in a region of smaller energies there is a rapid oscillation of @xmath0 , reflecting the threshold behaviour ; at higher energies the oscillation length increases with energy as predicted qualitatively by asymptotic mlla , but the oscillation amplitude is much smaller . in fact , for hadrons at lep energies we predict @xmath244 beyond the first minimum at @xmath245 . also , there are secondary extrema of @xmath0 as a function of energy for a given rank @xmath2 .",
    "the approach to the asymptotic dla region is very slow if visible at all . * for fixed resolution parameter",
    "@xmath4 the moments of jets and hadrons are rather different as a consequence of the running coupling .",
    "we conclude that the perturbative approach yields good results not only for single particle phenomena , such as single inclusive spectra and mean multiplicities , as envisaged originally in the lphd approach , but also for correlations of high order . above the poissonian transition point ,",
    "the short range correlations initiated by resonance decays for hadrons and gluon bremsstrahlung for partons become increasingly important and lead to the broadening of the multiplicity distribution of both hadrons and jets ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "so there is a duality also between hadronic and partonic correlations .",
    "moreover , the absolute normalization , originally considered as free parameter , can be studied as function of resolution @xmath4 and a unified description of hadronic and jet phenomena is possible , using the variable @xmath210 in ( [ ycs ] ) with the shifted @xmath4 prescription , both for multiplicities and correlations .",
    "both the predicted energy evolution of hadronic correlations and the @xmath4 dependence of the jet correlations follow the experimental results closely , with the exception of jets near the @xmath246 quark threshold . in the jet regime @xmath247 gev ,",
    "the effect of the hadronic scale @xmath8 becomes negligible and we are in the domain of perturbative qcd with the single parameter @xmath11 only ; @xmath30 is then an external parameter to be chosen by the experimenter . at smaller scales ,",
    "the hadronic scale @xmath8 becomes important , and the results become model dependent .",
    "the transition region from jets to hadrons for @xmath50 , which shows strong variations of all moments , is very well reproduced by the parton mc with low cut - off @xmath248 . in this region",
    "the coupling becomes large , i.e. @xmath249 .",
    "an extension of the calculation into this kinematic region is not justified a priori , but , as seen from the analytical results , the convergence of the perturbation theory is not in danger , and the solutions can be obtained from the evolution equations or from the mc .",
    "this successful description can be viewed at least as a good effective parametrization of the soft transition region .    with increasing order ,",
    "accurate calculations are required .",
    "so far , this is only accessible by numerical methods .",
    "further improvements are possible by including heavy quarks in the parton evolution and by including the 2-loop results .",
    "the good description of the data by the mc model with normalization @xmath250 implies that in the considered applications , one parton counts about one hadron and the hadron final state is well represented by a parton final state of the same multiplicity at resolution scale @xmath12 .",
