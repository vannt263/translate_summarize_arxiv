    "the spring - pendulum , which is known also under other names : swinging spring or elastic pendulum , is a very simple mechanical system having a very complex dynamical behaviour and this is why sometimes it is included to nonlinear paradigms .",
    "it consists of a point with mass @xmath5 suspended from a fixed point by a light spring , moving under a constant vertical gravitation field . in cartesian coordinates @xmath6 with the origin at the point of suspension of the pendulum , the system is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 is the unstretched length of the spring , @xmath10 is the young modulus of the spring .",
    "the motion of this system is a complicated combination of two motions : swinging like a pendulum and bouncing up and down like a spring .",
    "according to our knowledge , this system appeared first in @xcite as a simple classical analogue for the quantum phenomenon of fermi resonance in the infra - red spectrum of carbon dioxide .",
    "more about the history of this system can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently it has been analyzed in connection with the modelling of phenomena in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "because of the complicated dynamics , various approaches for its analysis were applied : asymptotic methods @xcite , various perturbation methods @xcite , numerical methods @xcite , various formulations of kam theorem , the poincare section , the lapunov exponents @xcite , the melnikov method @xcite , etc .",
    "a brief review of a large number of earlier papers on the spring - pendulum can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian system generated by  ( [ eq : h0 ] ) possesses two first integrals : hamilton function @xmath11 and the third component of the angular momentum @xmath12 and for its complete integrabilty in the liouville sense the third first integral is missing .",
    "numerical computations suggest that such additional first integral does not exist and the system is chaotic .",
    "the first rigorous non - integrability proof for this system was obtained by churchill @xcite by means of the ziglin theory @xcite .",
    "this result can be formulated in the following theorem .",
    "[ eq : ch ] if the hamiltonian system given by hamiltonian function @xmath11 is integrable with meromorphic first integrals in the liouville sense , then @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a rational number .",
    "morales and ramis using their theory formulated in @xcite obtained a stronger result ; they restricted the family  ( [ eq : warun ] ) of values of parameter @xmath1 for which the system can be integable .",
    "namely , they proved in  @xcite the following .",
    "[ thm : mo ] if the hamiltonian system given by hamiltonian function @xmath11 is integrable with meromorphic first integrals in the liouville sense , then @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an integer .    from the above theorem it easily follows that the physical spring - pendulum with @xmath17 is non - integrable except for the case @xmath18 . for @xmath18",
    "the system is integrable because of separation of variables in the potential .",
    "in fact , the results presented above concern the two dimensional spring - pendulum system obtained in the following way . if we choose initial conditions in such a way that value of @xmath19 equals zero , then the motion takes place in a vertical plane and we obtain the two - dimensional system . but the non - integrability of the two - dimensional spring - pendulum implies immediately the non - integrability of the three - dimensional spring - pendulum .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the integrability of the spring - pendulum system when the elastic potential contains also a cubic term . in other words ,",
    "we consider a generalised spring - pendulum system described by the following hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] if the hamiltonian system given by hamiltonian function  _ _ is integrable with meromorphic first integrals in the liouville sense , then @xmath22 .",
    "in our proof of this theorem we apply the morales - ramis theory and some tools of differential algebra .",
    "basic facts from the morales - ramis theory and some results concerning special linear differential equations are presented in section  2 .",
    "we derive variational equations and the normal variational equations for a family of particular solutions in section  3 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] is proved in sections  4 ( case @xmath23 ) and 5 ( case @xmath24 ) . in section  4 we revise the result of morales formulated in theorem  [ thm : mo ] .",
    "namely , we show that for values of @xmath1 given by condition   the system is non - integrable except for the case @xmath18 . in this section",
    "we also show two different kinds of arguments which give rise to non - integrability of the classical spring - pendulum system when @xmath25 . in section  6",
    ", we study the exceptional case @xmath26 and conclude that the morales - ramis method yields no obstruction to integrability , whereas dynamical analysis seems to indicate that the system is not completely integrable .",
    "the morales - ramis theory was applied to study the integrability of many hamiltonian systems , see examples in book  @xcite and in papers  @xcite .",
    "the differential galois approach was used also for proving non - integrability of non - hamiltonian systems , see  @xcite .",
    "difficulties in application of this theory can be of a different nature but mainly depend on dimensionality of the problem and the number of parameters .",
    "although it seems that the morales - ramis theory gives the strongest necessary conditions for the integrability , as far as we know , no new integrable system was found with the help of it .",
    "for the system investigated in this paper we have a very exceptional situation : we found a one parameter family of hamiltonian systems for which the necessary conditions of integrability are satisfied , but , nevertheless , there is evidence that this family is not integrable , either .",
    "another example of such family can be found in  @xcite .",
    "below we only mention basic notions and facts concerning the morales - ramis theory following @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system of differential equations @xmath27 defined on a complex @xmath28-dimensional manifold @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 is a non - equilibrium solution of , then the maximal analytic continuation of @xmath30 defines a riemann surface @xmath31 with @xmath32 as a local coordinate .",
    "together with system we can also consider variational equations ( ves ) restricted to @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 we can always reduce the order of this system by one considering the induced system on the normal bundle @xmath35 of @xmath31 @xcite @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the projection .",
    "the system of @xmath38 equations obtained in this way yields the so - called normal variational equations ( nves ) .",

    "it is obvious that @xmath42 .",
    "a non - constant rational function @xmath43 of @xmath44 variables @xmath45 is called an integral ( or invariant ) of the monodromy group if @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .    in his two fundamental papers @xcite",
    ", ziglin showed that if system possesses a meromorphic first integral , then the monodromy group @xmath39 of the normal variational equations has a rational integral ( an invariant function ) .",
    "this result allowed him to formulate a necessary condition for the integrability of hamiltonian system .",
    "if system is hamiltonian then necessarily @xmath48 and there exists function @xmath49 on @xmath29 such that @xmath50 for an arbitrary vector field @xmath51 on @xmath29 ( here @xmath52 denotes a symplectic structure on @xmath29 ) . for a given particular solution",
    "@xmath30 we fix the energy level @xmath53 . restricting to this level , we obtain a well defined system on @xmath54 dimensional manifold with a known particular solution @xmath30 . for this restricted system",
    "we perform the reduction of order of variational equations . thus , the normal variational equations for a hamiltonian system with @xmath5 degrees of freedom have dimension @xmath55 and their monodromy group is a subgroup of @xmath56 .",
    "the spectrum of an element of the monodromy group @xmath57 has the form @xmath58 and @xmath59 is called resonant if @xmath60    in  @xcite ziglin proved the main theorem of his theory .",
    "here we formulate it as in  @xcite .",
    "let us assume that there exists a non - resonant element @xmath47 .",
    "if the hamiltonian system with @xmath5 degrees of freedom has @xmath5 meromorphic first integrals @xmath61 , which are functionally independent in a connected neigbourhood of @xmath31 , then any other monodromy matrix @xmath62 transforms eigenvectors of @xmath59 to its eigenvectors .",
    "recently morales - ruiz and ramis generalised the ziglin approach replacing the monodromy group @xmath39 by the differential galois group @xmath63 of nves , see @xcite . for a precise definition of the differential galois group",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we can consider @xmath63 as a subgroup of @xmath64 which acts on fundamental solutions of and does not change polynomial relations among them . in particular , this group maps one fundamental solution to other fundamental solutions .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that @xmath65 and @xmath63 is an algebraic subgroup of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , it is a union of disjoint connected components .",
    "one of them containing the identity is called the identity component of @xmath63 and is denoted by @xmath66 .",

    "[ thm : mr ] assume that a hamiltonian system is meromorphically integrable in the liouville sense in a neigbourhood of the analytic curve @xmath31 .",
    "then the identity component of the differential galois group of nves associated with @xmath31 is abelian .",
    "we see that assumptions in the above theorem are stronger than in the ziglin theorem .",
    "moreover , as @xmath67 , theorem  [ thm : mr ] gives stronger necessary integrability conditions than the ziglin criterion .    in applications of the morales - ramis criterion",
    "the first step is to find a non - equilibrium particular solution , very often it lies on an invariant submanifold .",
    "next , we calculate ves and nves . in the last step",
    "we have to check if @xmath66 of obtained nves is abelian . very often in applications we check only if @xmath66 is solvable , because if it is not , then the system is not integrable .    for some systems the necessary conditions for the integrability formulated in theorem  [ thm : mr ] are satisfied , but , nevertheless , they are non - integrable .",
    "in such cases , to prove the non - integrability we can use the stronger version of the morales - ramis theorem based on higher orders variational equations @xcite .",
    "the idea of higher variational equations is following . for system   with a particular solution",
    "@xmath30 we put @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a formal small parameter . inserting the above expansion into equation and comparing terms of the same order with respect to @xmath69 we",

    "let us first assume that the equation is reducible ( case ( i ) of lemma  [ lem : alg ] ) , i.e. it has an exponential solution . from remark  [ rem : exp ] we know that such solution has the form @xmath246 where the @xmath196 is an exponent at @xmath247 , and the degree @xmath5 of polynomial @xmath248 satisfies @xmath249 .    because the formal solution of valuation 0 at @xmath241 has a logarithm , the valuation ( i.e. the exponent ) of @xmath250 at @xmath251 must be equal to @xmath252 , so @xmath253 .",
    "the exponents at @xmath254 for @xmath255 of @xmath256 are of the form @xmath257 , ( @xmath258 a non - negative integer ) , so the relation for the degree @xmath5 is either @xmath259 , or @xmath260 , for some non - negative integer @xmath261 .    if @xmath259 , then @xmath262 , which is not possible , so we must have @xmath263 , which is possible only if @xmath264 , and hence @xmath265 .",
    "so the only possibility is @xmath266 . substituting this candidate into equation",
    "shows that this is not a solution .",
    "hence , the equation is irreducible and , because of the logarithms in the local solutions , the only possibility is that the differential galois group is the full @xmath115 , which proves the lemma .",
    "our main theorem  [ thm : main ] in the introduction now follows , as an immediate consequence of the morales - ramis theorem , from the considerations in section  4 ( for the case @xmath23 ) and from the above lemma .",
    "first we show that for the excluded case @xmath26 the necessary condition for integrability given by the morales - ramis theory is fulfilled .    for generalised spring - pendulum in case",
    "@xmath267 the identity component of differential galois group of nve  _ _ is abelian .    for @xmath26 equation",
    "reads @xmath268 so , it has the form of the lam equation with @xmath269 , and @xmath270 . for the prescribed choice of parameters the invariants @xmath97 and @xmath98 of the weierstrass function @xmath96 are following    @xmath271 the discriminant @xmath272}{1728},\\ ] ] is only zero for two exceptional values of @xmath146 corresponding to two local extrema of the potential . assuming that @xmath146 is different from these exceptional values",
    ", we can apply theorem  [ thm : lame ] .    as for equation",
    "we have @xmath269 , so @xmath273 or @xmath274 . since @xmath275 lam equation   is solvable and possesses the lam - hermite solutions @xcite .",
    "but for a lam equation with such solutions the differential galois group is abelian @xcite .    for the excluded energy values , i.e. when @xmath276 or @xmath277 ( see formula  ) the nve ( after transformation @xmath278 ) has the form of riemann @xmath76 equation which is solvable .",
    "namely , for both choices of @xmath146 the case ( ii ) from lemma  [ lem : alg ] occurs .",
    "thus , the identity component of the differential galois group of nve is abelian .",
    "let us notice here that we have at our disposal another family of particular solutions corresponding to the following invariant manifold @xmath279 however , as calculations show , using these particular solutions we do not obtain new necessary conditions for the integrability . because of this , we decide to apply theorem  [ thm : ho ] .",
    "following the decoupling of the first ve into tangential and normal equations ( see ) , we find that the second variational equations are the following , @xmath280 and @xmath281 where @xmath282 refer to solutions of the first variational system and @xmath283 refer to solutions of the second variational system that we want to solve .",
    "the equations are now inhomogeneous , with left - hand sides corresponding to the ( homogeneous ) first variational equations , and right - hand sides formed of solutions of the first variational equations ( which induces coupling ) .",
    "these equations look non - linear , at first .",
    "however , as explained in @xcite , the right - hand sides are formed of linear combinations of solutions of the second symmetric powers of the first variational system . hence , the second variational system , together with the first , still reduces to a linear differential system and it makes sense to study its differential galois group and its integrability .",
    "this fact remains true for variational equations of an arbitrary order .",
    "as the first variational equations are solvable , we could write explicit solutions and then solve the second variational equations by variation of constants , but a better strategy is to proceed as in @xcite : as the first variational equations are lam equations , they have abelian galois group if and only if their formal solutions at zero do not contain logarithms @xcite , and it is shown in @xcite that this remains true for variational equations of an arbitrary order .",
    "this is easily tested in the following way : first we compute formal solutions ( as a power series ) of the first variational equations around zero .",
    "then we plug a generic linear combination of these power series in the right hand sides of and .",
    "next we apply the method of variation of constants : we thus have to integrate a ( known ) combination of power series and there is a logarithm if and only if this combination of power series has a non - zero residue ( i.e. a term of degree @xmath284 in its ( laurent ) expansion in powers of @xmath32 ) .    performing this computation",
    "we show that the second variational equations are integrable . iterating the process , we computed the solutions of the third , fourth ,  , until the seventh variational equations and found that they are all integrable .",
    "we could not continue the calculations to higher variational equations for the following reasons .",
    "the first fact is that the size of the right hand sides of the successive variational equations grows rapidly .",
    "the second fact is that the valuation of the solutions decreases as the order of the variational equation grows .",
    "for example , the valuations of @xmath285 is @xmath286 , the valuation of @xmath287 is @xmath288 , .. , and the valuation of @xmath289 is @xmath290 . to obtain @xmath291 with an accuracy up to the term of degree @xmath292 ( to obtain the terms of negative valuation properly , which is all we need for integrability by the above remarks ) , we need to start from an @xmath293 with 27 terms . to obtain @xmath289",
    ", we need to start from an @xmath293 with 30 terms , and so on .",
    "the combination of these two facts makes the computation intractable for the variational equations of order eight .",
    "the fact that the valuations decrease is no surprise .",
    "we know that the restriction of the hamiltonian flow to the invariant manifold @xmath294 of section  [ sec : par ] is an integrable system with one degree of freedom .",
    "calculations show that the corresponding solution @xmath295 has a valuation at zero that decreases just like the @xmath296 above ( and indeed seems to govern the lowest valuation in the @xmath296 ) .",
    "now the fact that the variational equations up to order 7 are integrable might lead to a suspicion that the system could be integrable .",
    "however , numerical experiments clearly indicate chaotic behaviour which contradicts meromorphic integrability .",
    "we show an example of our numerical experiments in figure  [ fig : cross ] . in this figure",
    "we show the poincar cross section for energy @xmath297 and @xmath298 . on the level @xmath299 we chose @xmath300 as coordinates .",
    "the cross - section plane was fixed at @xmath301 .",
    "the model of the generalised swinging pendulum for @xmath26 is thus a puzzling example of a system that seems ( numerically ) to be non - integrable but where even a deep application of the morales - ramis theory is not enough to detect rigorously this non - integrability .",
    "there is only one reported result concerning application of higher variational equations for proving non - integrability . in @xcite morales - ruiz reports",
    "that for a certain case of the henon - heiles system the identity component of the differential galois group of first and second order ves is abelian but for the third order ve it is not .",
    "we have also several examples of hamiltonian system for which @xmath73 have abelian identity component of differential galois group for @xmath302 but non - abelian for @xmath303 .",
    "thus , as far as we know the generalised spring - pendulum system with @xmath26 is the only example where the application of higher order variational equations is unsuccessful in proving non - integrability .",
