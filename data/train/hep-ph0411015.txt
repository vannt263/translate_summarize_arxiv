    "the partonic energy loss in a qcd plasma has received significant attention in recent years .",
    "experimentally , the partonic energy loss can be probed by measuring the high @xmath3 hadrons emanating from ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "this idea was first proposed by bjorken @xcite where ` ionization loss ' of the quarks and gluons in a qcd plasma was estimated .",
    "in fact , the ` stopping power ' ( @xmath2 ) of the plasma is proportional to @xmath4 , where , @xmath5 is the energy density of the partonic medium .",
    "therefore , by measuring various high @xmath3 observables one can probe the initial parton density @xcite .",
    "hard partons , injected into hot qcd medium , can dissipate energy in two ways , _ viz . _ , by two body collisions or _ via _ the bremsstrahlung emission of gluons , commonly referred to as collisional and radiative loss respectively . for electromagnetic processes , it is well known that at large energies , radiative losses are much higher than the collisional loss .",
    "in fact , there is a critical energy @xmath1 , at which , both the processes contribute equally  @xcite . in qcd plasma , however , the situation is more involved because of the non - abelian nature of the interaction . we shall show that for low energy partons @xmath0 processes are equally important .",
    "this is particularly so for heavy quarks  @xcite . in qcd plasma , to our knowledge , such estimation of @xmath1 is not known yet .",
    "we address this issue in the present work .",
    "obviously this requires complete treatment of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 ( or higher order ) processes .",
    "while significant progress has been made over the past decade to estimate bremsstrahlung induced partonic energy loss @xcite , collisional loss , as we uncover , begs further attention .",
    "the energy loss of partons in a qcd plasma due to the dissociation of the possible binary bound states in a strongly coupled qgp has recently been considered by shuryak _",
    "et al . _",
    "they have shown that the partonic energy loss due to this process is important in a narrow interval of plasma temperatures .",
    "it may be noted that unlike radiative loss in which mostly relativistic gluons are produced , collisional / ionization loss , on the contrary , injects energy - momentum and entropy into the plasma .",
    "however , in this work we discuss only parton parton scattering , not the dissociation of the binary bound state .",
    "the partonic energy loss in a qcd plasma was first estimated by bjorken @xcite .",
    "considering two body scattering of the parton off thermal quarks and gluons , the following expression for the energy loss is obtained .",
    "= ( 1+)_s^2 t^2 ( ) [ bjorken ] in the above equation , @xmath7 term is for quark sector while the other one is responsible for the gluonic loss .",
    "bjorken retains only the infrared divergent part of the integral . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 denote maximum and minimum momentum transfer . evidently , as indicated in ref.@xcite itself , that this expression breaks down in the infrared region due to plasma effects .",
    "the presence of @xmath10 and @xmath11 should be noted here , for which one takes reasonable values from physical argument . in principle , however , should emerge from the theory itself in a natural way .",
    "physically energy losses for partons traversing plasma can be divided into two parts .",
    "one due to close collisions involving hard momentum transfer , to be treated microscopically in terms of individual scatterings , and the other for the distant collisions involving soft momentum transfer . evidently , for the latter , the de broglie wave length of the exchanged particle becomes comparable with the inter particle distance ( @xmath12 ) , which renders the concept of individual scattering meaningless and necessitates the inclusion of the plasma effects .    in the long wave length regime",
    "the problem of energy loss can be treated macroscopically in terms of classical chromoelectric field .",
    "this coherent regime of partonic energy loss was first calculated by thoma and gyulassy @xcite for the heavy quark .",
    "they actually express relative energy loss in terms of the chromodielectric field tensor by combining hard thermal loop corrected gluon propagator with the techniques of classical plasma physics as : & & = + & & [ gt ] in this formalism , the ambiguity related with the lower cut off is naturally removed by the inclusion of the polarization effects .",
    "however , this description also breaks down at some ultraviolet scale @xcite and should therefore be cut off at some hard momentum scale .    evidently , eqs .",
    "[ bjorken ] and  [ gt ] capture physics relevant for two different kinematic regime and therefore complimentary to each other .",
    "any complete calculation should include both the infrared and ultraviolet part as discussed at length by mrowczynski  @xcite and braaten _",
    "et al._@xcite to evaluate the total energy loss . in ref.@xcite for the first time",
    "a complete calculation for the partonic energy loss was presented . here",
    "the hard part was treated along the line of ref.@xcite and the soft part was calculated classically .",
    "however , the ambiguity related to the separation of scale remained till the full field theoretic techniques was developed by braaten and pisarski  @xcite which was subsequently used to calculate the energy loss of heavy fermions by braaten and yuan  @xcite . in their formalism it was shown how the infrared cut off naturally arise from the hard thermal loop resummation scheme and at the same time the intermediate scale dependence is removed from the theory where the separation of scale appears in the argument of the logarithms and cancels automatically when contributions of these two regimes are added together  @xcite .",
    "in retrospect of these developments we revisit the problem of light quark and gluon energy loss in a qcd plasma .",
    "the treatment of light quarks ( or gluons ) is different from that of heavy quarks in many different ways .",
    "primarily this is related to the presence of the light quarks or gluons in the thermal bath .",
    "this would modify the thermal phase space .",
    "in addition there will be back reactions which should be taken into account .",
    "moreover , unlike heavy quark , their light partners can even be annihilated with the thermal constituents .",
    "most importantly , light quarks or gluons involve subtleties related to the processes having identical final state species which was not properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to unravel the relative contribution of individual processes .",
    "therefore , we take all possible channels including elastic and inelastic scatterings . consequently ,",
    "estimated @xmath13 , is higher than reported before .",
    "in fact , the two body compton like scattering , proves to be quite efficient in transferring energy into the plasma .",
    "in addition , we also evaluate explicitly the collisional loss of gluon energy .",
    "for this , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are found to be most important .",
    "it might be mentioned that calculations reported in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) were restricted only to the @xmath16 channel processes , thereby , excluding the interference and exchange terms , which contribute significantly .",
    "they are particularly important for processes having @xmath17 channel divergences .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we develop the formalism . which will be used afterwards . in section iii contributions from various channels on the collisional energy loss of partons",
    "have been presented .",
    "these results are then compared with radiative loss . in section iv",
    ", we explicitly treat both the soft and hard momentum transfer regime and show how infrared divergence , originally present in the previous sections are automatically removed by the plasma effects .",
    "in addition we demonstrate that the final expression is free from the momentum cut off introduced to regulate the divergences in two ( soft and hard ) kinematic regimes .",
    "section v is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "various sum rules used in section iv are collected in the appendix .",
    "while the heavy quark energy loss is very similar to the muon energy loss in a plasma of electrons and positrons , light quark energy loss is analogous to the electron energy loss in a qed plasma . therefore to calculate the relevant @xmath2 arising out of two body scatterings , we introduce a formalism along the line similar to what is employed to study cosmic ray showers @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we define a differential collision probability , @xmath18 which represents the probability of a parton with energy @xmath19 to transfer an amount of energy between @xmath20 and @xmath21 to a plasma constituent in traversing a thickness @xmath22 . energy loss can be obtained by convoluting @xmath23 with the energy transfer @xmath24 for each processes which generically is given by ,    = _ e_^e _ e^(e , e^)de^. [ dedx ]    in the above equation , @xmath25 is the maximum energy transfer , while @xmath26 is a cut off used to regulate infrared divergence related to the usual small angle limit .",
    "however , in case of energy loss calculation @xmath27 divergence that appears in the cross section becomes softer as schematically @xmath28 , where , @xmath29 , tames the divergence .",
    "this cut - off procedure can be avoided by incorporating appropriate screening effects @xcite .",
    "the differential collision probability is defined as ( e , e^)de^=^2 f(k ) [ theta ] where f= where @xmath30 is the statistical degeneracy of the particles in the thermal bath .",
    "it might be mentioned that for coulomb like scattering , @xmath31 and therefore @xmath32 .",
    "this , evidently , is divergent and gives the logarithmic dependence of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the energy of the incoming parton @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the temperature of the system .",
    "now we consider a specific process @xmath35 , the matrix element for which is given by the following expression ,     charge and @xmath36 is the strong coupling constant .    for @xmath35 , the differential collision probability can be expressed as ( e , e^)=(1 - 2 + 2 ) where @xmath34 is the temperature of the medium .",
    "the last equation together with eq .",
    "[ dedx ] gives the following expression for the energy loss ,    ln(e/_0 ) [ dedxhard0 ] where @xmath37 is the lower cut off . in ref .",
    "@xcite this is taken as @xmath38 while in ref  @xcite @xmath39 .",
    "we in section iv , show that how this cut off follows from the full calculation . a complete treatment of this singularity in the context of heavy quark energy loss both for soft and hard momentum transfer within hard thermal loop re - summation scheme has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we present corresponding calculations for the light quarks in a slightly different approach .    in the subsequent sections , we present explicit expressions of @xmath23 for various processes .",
    "corresponding qed results are also derived for comparison @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined in the laboratory frame .",
    "let us first consider propagation of a hard quark through a qcd plasma . the collisions which would contribute to its energy loss are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath15 and @xmath43 . in the above processes primes indicate different flavors",
    "it might be mentioned that in a baryon free region , _",
    "i.e. _ , in absence of a net baryonic chemical potential , quark and anti - quark energy loss will be the same .",
    "therefore , we do not treat them separately .",
    "the most dominant process for quark energy loss , as mentioned before , is compton like scattering , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44 . beside the @xmath16 channel ,",
    "contributions from additional diagrams are found to be non - negligible .",
    "the differential collision probability for the compton like scattering is as follows :    _ q g q g(e , e^)de^&= & t^2de^[compton ]    in eq .  [ compton ] , the first three terms come from the @xmath16 channel and others originate from the exchange diagram and @xmath45 channel .",
    "evidently , @xmath46 gives rise to logarithmic enhancement .",
    "thus overall contribution becomes significant if one retains all the possible diagrams . to get the energy loss ,",
    "one integrates the differential collision probability weighted with the energy transfer as shown in eq .",
    "[ dedx ] to yield : ( ) _ q g q g = t^2 [ comptondedx ] in writing the above equation , we have used @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , the energy of the hard parton , it is also assumed here that @xmath49 .",
    "this is justified , as for the present problem , partonic jets have very high energy compared to the energy of the plasma constituents which could be @xmath50 3 t .",
    "it should be noted that the coefficient of the logarithmic term is different from that one obtains by restricting to the @xmath16 channel alone .",
    "next we consider mller type @xmath51 scattering for which the differential collision probability @xcite reads ,    _",
    "qqqq(e , e^)de^&= & t^2 de^ , where , @xmath52 . in the last expression if we replace @xmath53 by @xmath54 and @xmath55 by -2 , the electron energy loss due to mller scattering ensues @xcite .",
    "this reaction deserves special attention as it involves two identical particles in the final state .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 , in this case , should be interpreted as the probability of a collision which leaves one parton in the energy state @xmath20 and the other in the energy state @xmath56 . to take into account all the possibilities ,",
    "@xmath20 is varied from @xmath57 to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "similar subtlety is involved for processes like @xmath14 or @xmath59 etc . the final expression for @xmath51",
    "is given by ( ) _ qq q q = t^2 .",
    "[ mollerdedx ]    the other important reaction is @xmath60 , which also has @xmath61 divergence  @xcite and therefore , found to contribute significantly to the total energy loss . it should be noted that there is no @xmath62 divergence involved in this process hence the collision is dominated by soft scattering and result do not differ much if the relevant @xmath45 channel diagram is excluded .",
    "we , nevertheless , retain all the diagrams . the differential probability for ` bhabha ' like scattering , therefore , takes the form : _ q    ( ) _ q |q",

    "finally we present results for the process , @xmath65 .",
    "this again involved identical particles in the final channel for which appropriate limit is taken .",
    "this process is also suppressed because of less sensitive infrared divergences as evident from the expression :    _ q |qg g(e , e^)de^&= & t^2 de^[qqbargg ]    other important reactions for which we do not present explicit results include @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "they contribute equally to the energy loss ( for baryon free matter ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath68 induced energy loss is small because of the absence of infrared enhancement .",
    "this is less divergent ( no @xmath61 or @xmath69 ) , and , therefore , found to be less effective means of energy dissipation .",
    "similar to quarks , hard gluons can also dissipate energy while colliding with the plasma constituents .",

    "net energy loss of a light quark is given by the sum of all these diagrams including scattering and annihilation processes .",

    "in the previous section the results for the quark and gluon energy loss are presented with a lower cut off @xmath37 .",
    "this was introduced to regulate the infrared divergence . in this section ,",
    "we explicitly show that infrared divergence is automatically screened by the plasma effects while there exists a separation scale coming from the two kinematic regimes .",
    "ultimately it is removed from the final expression once both the hard scattering and the collective plasma effects are added .",
    "we also assume that the energy of the incoming parton is much larger than the temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33 . the soft and hard momentum transfer ( @xmath97 ) is determined by the fact whether @xmath98 or @xmath99 and while for the former the interaction is screened by the debye mass ( for the electric mode or dynamically for the magnetic part ) .",
