    "while collective herding behaviour is popularly studied among animals , it can also be observed in human beings . in this regard , there are interesting problems across the fields of sociology @xcite , social psychology @xcite , ethnology @xcite@xcite , and economics .",
    "statistical physics has been an effective tool to analyse these macro phenomena among human beings and has led to the development of an associated field , sociophysics @xcite@xcite .",
    "for example , in statistical physics , anomalous fluctuations in financial markets @xcite@xcite and opinion dynamics @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite have been discussed .",
    "most individuals observe the actions of other individuals to estimate public perception and then make a choice similar to that of the others ; this is called social learning . because it is usually sensible to do what other people are doing , collective herding behaviour is assumed to be the result of a rational choice that is based on public perception .",
    "while this approach could be viable in some ordinary cases , as a macro phenomenon , it can sometimes lead to arbitrary or even erroneous decisions .",
    "this phenomenon is known as an information cascade @xcite . in this paper , we show that an information cascade is described by the ising model .    in our previous paper",
    ", we introduced a sequential voting model @xcite . at each time",
    "step @xmath2 , one voter opts for either of two candidates . as public perception",
    ", the @xmath2th voter can see all previous votes , that is , @xmath3 votes . to identify the relationship between information cascade and phase transition , we introduce two types of voters  herders and independents .",
    "we also introduce two candidates",
    ".    the herders behaviour is known as the influence response function , and threshold rules have been derived for a variety of relevant theoretical scenarios representing this function .",
    "some empirical and experimental evidence supports the assumption that individuals follow threshold rules when making decisions in the presence of social influence @xcite .",
    "this rule posits that individuals will switch from one decision to another only when sufficiently many others have adopted the other decision .",
    "such individuals are called digital herders @xcite . from our experiments",
    ", we observed that human beings exhibit a behaviour between that of digital and analog herders , that is , the tanh - type herder @xcite .",
    "we obtained the probability that a herder makes a choice under the influence of his / her prior voters votes .",
    "this probability can be fitted by a @xmath0 function @xcite .    here",
    ", we discuss a voting model with two candidates .",
    "we set two types of voters : independents and herders .",
    "as their name suggests , the independents collect information independently , that is , their voting depends on their fundamental values and rationality .",
    "in contrast , the voting of herders is based on public perception , which is visible to them in the form of previous votes . in this study",
    ", we consider the case wherein a voter can see the latest @xmath1 previous votes .",
    "when @xmath4 is the upper limit of @xmath2 , we can observe several phenomena @xcite . in the case where there are independent voters and digital herders , the independents cause the distribution of votes to converge to one - peak distribution , a dirac measure when the ratio of herders is small .",
    "however , if the ratio of herders increases above the transition point , we can observe the information cascade transition . as the fraction of herders increases",
    ", the model features a phase transition beyond which a state where most voters make the correct choice coexists with one where most of them are wrong .",
    "further , the distribution of votes changes from one peak to two peaks .    in the previous paper , we discussed the finite @xmath1 case @xcite .",
    "we analysed the model by using mean field approximations and concluded that information cascade transition occurs when @xmath5 . in this paper , we discuss the model from other perspectives and show that there is no phase transition when @xmath1 is finite and the solution oscillates between two equilibria .",
    "furthermore , we show relations among our voting model , kirman s ant colony model , and kinetic ising model .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce our voting model and mathematically define the two types of voters  independents and herders . in section 3 , we discuss the case where there are digital herders and independents . in section 4 , we verify the transitions between voting choices through numerical simulations . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the case where there are analog herders and independents and show the relation between our voting model and kirman s ant colony model . in section 6",
    ", we discuss the relation between our voting model and the kinetic ising model . in the final section",
    ", we present the conclusions .",
    "we model the voting of two candidates , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the voting is sequential , and at time @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 have @xmath8 and @xmath9 votes , respectively . in each time step ,",
    "one voter votes for one candidate .",
    "hence , at time @xmath2 , the @xmath2th voter votes , after which the total number of votes is @xmath2 .",
    "voters are allowed to see just @xmath1 previous votes for each candidate ; thus , they are aware of public perception .",
    "@xmath1 is a constant number .",
    "we assume an infinite number of two types of voters  independents and herders .",
    "the independents vote for @xmath6 and @xmath7 with probabilities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "their votes are independent of others votes , that is , their votes are based on their own fundamental values .    here , we set @xmath6 as the wrong candidate and @xmath7 as the correct one in order to validate the performance of the herders .",
    "we can set @xmath12 , because we believe that independents vote for @xmath7 rather than for @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , we assume that the intelligence of the independents is virtually accurate .",
    "in contrast , the herders votes are based on the number of previous @xmath1 votes . at time @xmath2 , the information of @xmath1 previous votes are the number of votes for @xmath6 and @xmath7:@xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath15 holds .",
    "if @xmath16 , voters can see @xmath2 previous votes for each candidate . for the limit @xmath17 , voters can see all previous votes .",
    "we define the number of all previous votes for @xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "now we define the majority s correct decision .",
    "if the ratio to the candidate @xmath7 who is correct is @xmath20 , we define the majority as correct ( wrong ) .",
    "this ratio is important to evaluate the performance of the herders . in this paper , we consider three kinds of herders , namely digital , analog , and tanh - type herders .",
    "we define @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "the probability that a herder who refers @xmath21 votes to the candidate @xmath7 is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "digital herders always choose the candidate with a majority of the previous @xmath1 votes , which is visible to them @xcite . in this case , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a heaviside function .",
    "analog herders vote for each candidate with probabilities that are proportional to the candidates votes @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath26 .",
    "the other herder is the tanh - type herder , who is an intermediate between analog and digital herders @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath27 .",
    "the independents and herders appear randomly and vote .",
    "we set the ratio of independents to herders as @xmath28 . in this study",
    ", we mainly focus on the upper limit of @xmath2 .",
    "this refers to the voting of infinite voters .",
    "in this section , the herder is a digital herder @xcite , and hence , votes for the majority candidate ; if @xmath29 , herders vote for the candidate @xmath6 . if @xmath30 , herders vote for the candidate @xmath7 . if @xmath31 , herders vote for @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the same probability , that is , 1/2 .    in the previous paper , we discussed this case by using mean field approximations @xcite . in this paper , we discuss this using stochastic partial differential equations .",
    "first , we consider an approximation to introduce the partial differential equations .",
    "the voter selects @xmath1 votes randomly from the latest previous @xmath1 voters with overlapping",

    "this means that at time @xmath37 , the number of votes for @xmath7 is @xmath38 . here",

    "@xmath39 can be calculated as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .    for convenience ,",

    "it is the same as the mean field approximation in @xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath65 , which is the second term of rhs , the herders behave as digital herders and ( [ i3 ] ) becomes the strict form for them .    when @xmath66 , there is only one solution of ( [ i3 ] ) in the range @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath68 , there is only one solution in @xmath69 and three solutions in @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is critical @xmath67 @xcite .",
