    "the emergence of the hall plateau together with the vanishing longitudinal resistance has been considered to be the unique signal of the quantum hall ( qh ) effect@xcite .",
    "this is certainly the case in the monolayer qh system .",
    "however , recent experiments@xcite have revealed an anomalous behavior of the hall resistance in a counterflow geometry in the bilayer qh system that both the longitudinal and hall resistances vanish at the total bilayer filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "another anomalous hall resistance has been reported in a drag experimentkellogg02 .",
    "though a suggestion@xcite has been made that the anomalous phenomenon would occur owing to excitonic excitations ( electron - hole pairs in opposite layers ) in the counterflow transport , there exists no theory demonstrating these phenomena explicitly in a unified way .",
