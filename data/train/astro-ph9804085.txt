    "one of the pillars of the standard cosmological models is the large  scale homogeneity of the universe ( e.g. peebles 1993 ) .",
    "the standard statistical methods to analyze the large  scale structure , as the two  point correlation function @xmath2 , are described by peebles ( 1980 ) ; they rely on the definition of a mean galaxy density @xmath3 , which is meaningful only if the assumption of large  scale homogeneity is true",
    ". however , at small scales the autocorrelation function of the galaxy distribution is positive and can be fitted by a power ",
    "law , which is a property of a fractal set ( see peebles 1980 ) .",
    "on the basis of the observational evidence that galaxies are clustered in ever increasing systems , from groups and clusters to superclusters , de vaucouleurs ( 1970 , 1971 ) presented `` the case for a hierarchical cosmology '' century ( see e. harrison , 1987 , _ darkness at night , a riddle of the universe _",
    ", harvard university press , cambridge ) ; in this century , fournier dalbe and charlier were the first to propose a hierarchical ( now we would say fractal ) model of the universe ( see mandelbrot 1982 ) . ] .",
    "mandelbrot ( 1982 ) developed this concept , suggesting that the galaxy distribution in the universe is fractal , with dimension @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , in the last 20 years redshift surveys at increasing depths have revealed ever larger structures and voids ( see e.g. davis et al .",
    "1982 ; de lapparent et al .",
    "1986 , da costa et al .",
    "1994 , vettolani et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "einasto et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found evidence that @xmath5 increases with sample volume , but they estimated that it should reach a value @xmath6   for a fair sample of the universe .",
    "pietronero ( 1987 ) stressed that , if homogeneity is not reached , the correlation length @xmath5 can not be taken as a measure of the clustering amplitude , and suggested a slightly but significantly different definition of the autocorrelation function . adopting this approach , coleman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) reanalyzed the cfa1 redshift survey ( huchra et al .",
    "1983 ) , concluding that the distribution of galaxies was fractal to at least 20 . on the other hand , davis et al .",
    "( 1988 ) found that @xmath5 increased as @xmath7 , and not linearly with the depth as predicted for a simple fractal ( see also maurogordato et al .",
    "others advocated the need for a multifractal approach ( e.g. balian & schaeffer 1989 ; martinez & jones 1990 ; martinez et al .",
    "1990 ) ; this is however another issue and we will not discuss it : see for example the review by borgani ( 1995 ) and references therein .",
    "the first redshift surveys sampled relatively small volumes , and the reality and nature of correlation amplitude variations with depth remained an open and much debated question . could these variations simply reflect fluctuations due to local structures ? were they a consequence of the fractal distribution of galaxies ? or were they an indirect consequence of the dependence of clustering on galaxy luminosity ?",
    "it should be pointed out that even at a scale @xmath8   we do not expect a _",
    "homogeneity , as cobe has found evidence of anisotropy in the cmb radiation at a level @xmath9 ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ) , a value necessary and sufficient , at least in some standard cosmological models , to explain the formation of the observed structures .",
    "the existence of very large structures in the universe implies that the galaxy or cluster autocorrelation function must be positive to a scale corresponding to the size of these structures ; but this is not necessarily inconsistent with the measured value of the galaxy autocorrelation length @xmath10   for @xmath11 galaxies ( as claimed by pietronero and collaborators ) , as larger structures have also a lower contrast , and the correlation of luminous matter may be significantly amplified relatively to the underlying dark matter correlation function ( kaiser 1984 ; bardeen et al .",
    "therefore , we expect that the galaxy and cluster distribution will not be perfectly homogeneous even at large scales .",
    "the claim for a fractal universe is obviously much more stronger than that : it implies that there is no convergence to homogeneity and that it is not possible to define a mean density @xmath3 of the universe .    in the last years pietronero and",
    "his collaborators applied statistical indicators which do not imply a universal mean density on an ever increasing number of catalogs ( see e.g. di nella et al .",
    "1996 , sylos labini , montuori & pietronero 1996 , montuori et al .",
    "1997 ) , claiming evidence for a galaxy fractal distribution at all scales .",
    "their results are impressive , as recently stressed by coles ( 1998 ) , but they appear to be at variance with the results of other groups who analyzed the same catalogs with standard indicators .",
    "it is clear that the situation is unsatisfactory , despite many articles and even public debates on the subject ( see pietronero et al .",
    "1997 ; davis 1997 ; guzzo 1997 ) ; while the strongest support to large  scale homogeneity comes indirectly from the high level of isotropy of the cmb radiation and from two  dimensional catalogs ( peebles 1996 ) , there is still confusion on the interpretation of the available three ",
    "dimensional data , mainly due to the difference in the statistical indicators , which do not allow a direct and quantitative comparison of the results .",
    "therefore we analyzed the southern sky redshift survey 2 ( ssrs2 ; da costa et al .",
    "1994 ) following the approach of pietronero and collaborators , in order to independently check their claims and to answer to their criticisms ( sylos labini et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter smp ) about the work of benoist et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter paper i ) . in section 2",
    "we discuss the apparent dependence of @xmath5 on sample depth ; in section 3 we describe the different statistics , and their relations ; in section 4 we present and discuss our fractal analysis of the ssrs2 in comparison with the standard analysis ; in section 5 we show that theoretical predictions derived from the standard cdm model can reproduce our results , and are therefore consistent with a homogeneous universe ; our conclusions are in section 6 .",
    "if the universe is homogeneous at large scales , then for any fair sample the statistical properties of the galaxy distribution should be the same ; in particular , the autocorrelation function of any given class of galaxies should not depend on the sample depth . on the contrary , if the universe is a simple fractal at all scales , the mean density in a sphere of radius @xmath12 centered on a randomly chosen galaxy will vary as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the so  called correlation dimension .",
    "the autocorrelation function will vary as    @xmath15    and the correlation length @xmath5 will increase with the sample depth :    @xmath16^{1/\\gamma } r_s\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a measure of the sample size .    in practice",
    ", there is the problem to define a sample not dominated by a few prominent structures , and to discriminate between a dependence of @xmath5 on the sample depth or on the absolute luminosities of the galaxies , as deeper volume  limited samples extracted from a magnitude  limited catalog will progressively include more luminous galaxies .",
    "the most recent results appear to confirm the original claims by hamilton ( 1988 ) and brner et al .",
    "( 1989 ) about a real dependence of @xmath5 on the luminosity .",
    "in particular , in paper i we analyzed the ssrs2 and showed that @xmath5 has a significant increase for @xmath19 galaxies .",
    "smp criticize these results and point out that a value of @xmath5 as large as 16 , as found in our paper i for the @xmath20 galaxies , has never been found in previous surveys as the cfa1 .",
    "we stress however that a ) the previous , shallower surveys do not contain enough galaxies with @xmath20 galaxies which , being rare , require a larger volume ; b ) as shown in figure 5 of paper i , the results obtained by hamilton on the cfa1 are consistent with the new ssrs2 results up to @xmath21 , representing the maximum luminosity reachable in a volume  limited sample large enough for a statistical analysis in the cfa1. notice that the cfa1 and the ssrs2 are limited respectively to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , so volume  limited samples containing galaxies with the same absolute luminosity have different depths ; their consistency at a fixed absolute magnitude is another argument in favor of luminosity segregation and against a fractal distribution .",
    "however , smp criticize our paper i also because we tested the independence of the correlation length from the sample depth only for a few subsamples ; moreover , they notice that the results obtained by sylos labini & pietronero ( 1996 ) on the perseus  pisces catalog show a systematic dependence of @xmath5 on the sample depth , and not on luminosity .",
    "indeed the same test performed by smp on the perseus ",
    "pisces is possible also for all the subsamples of the ssrs2 . in figure ( [ fig : depth ] ) we present @xmath5 with its bootstrap error as a function of the absolute magnitude for volume  limited samples of the ssrs2 selected with apparent limiting magnitudes of 14.5 and 15.5 ( see table 1 and 2 ) .",
    "notice that the distance limits for the volume ",
    "limited samples are calculated assuming @xmath24  km  s@xmath25  mpc@xmath25 and taking into account the k ",
    "correction , and they are conservatively fixed to include the galaxies of all the morphological types ( for more details see paper i ) .",
    ".volume  limited subsamples from the ssrs2 [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as discussed in paper i , the less deep subsamples ( including galaxies with a faint absolute magnitude ) may be affected by the dominance of local structures . from figure",
    "[ fig : depth ] , there is indeed marginal evidence for sampling variations in subsamples including galaxies with absolute magnitude fainter than @xmath26 , while for deeper subsamples galaxies with the same absolute magnitude have the same value of @xmath5 within the errors , independently of the sample depth .",
    "this consistency internal to the ssrs2 , in addition to the external consistency between subsamples extracted from the cfa1 and the ssrs2 , is a further and robust confirmation that the correlation amplitude depends on the luminosity and not on the sample depth .",
    "this result is obviously in disagreement with the claims by smp , based on subsamples of the perseus ",
    "pisces supercluster , which show indeed very large differences between the correlation length @xmath5 of galaxies with the same absolute magnitude but in volumes at different depths ( see their figure 40 ) .",
    "smp assume a constant error @xmath27 ; while a more realistic error would have been preferable , it can not be a large underestimate given the size of their subsamples .",
    "while there is no _ a priori _ reason to prefer one catalog to another , the type of information which can be extracted depends on the particular selection criteria of each catalog . in this case , contrarily to the `` anonymous '' cfa or ssrs redshift surveys , the name perseus ",
    "pisces redshift survey reminds us that it is a region of the sky selected because of the presence , at about @xmath28 km / s , of a large filamentary structure ( giovanelli & haynes 1991 ) . while many interesting statistical results can and could be obtained , their interpretation must take into account this peculiarity of the survey .",
    "for example , guzzo ( 1997 ) discusses the effect of the perseus ",
    "pisces supercluster on the galaxy counts , questioning the interpretation of pietronero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . as concerning the variation of @xmath5 with sample depth",
    ", we notice that a volume  limited sample including all galaxies brighter than -19 has a depth of @xmath29 km / s at an apparent limiting magnitude of @xmath22 , and a depth of @xmath30 km / s at an apparent limiting magnitude of @xmath23 . in the case of the perseus ",
    "pisces redshift survey , this means that in the first case we include the void in front of the supercluster but not the supercluster itself , while in the second case we include the whole supercluster .",
    "this might at least partly explain the discrepancy with our results ; therefore a fractal galaxy distribution does not appear as the most plausible explanation for the systematic variations of @xmath5 in the perseus ",
    "pisces redshift survey .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the statistical indicators used to assess the fractality of the universe are different from but not independent of the standard ones . in this section",
    "we will clarify the relations between the two sets of indicators .",
    "a simple dimensionless measure of galaxy clustering is the two  point correlation function @xmath31 , which is defined by the joint probability @xmath32 of finding a galaxy in a volume element @xmath33 and another galaxy in a volume element @xmath34 at separation @xmath35 : @xmath36 dv_1 dv_2 $ ] , where we take into account only the magnitude of the separation but not its direction , assuming as usual that the galaxy distribution is a stationary point  process ( see peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the two  point correlation function @xmath2 of a sample is measured generating a catalog of randomly distributed points in the same volume , with the same selection function , then counting the number @xmath37 of distinct galaxy  galaxy pairs at separation @xmath12 , and the number @xmath38 of galaxy  random pairs at separation @xmath12 ( davis & peebles 1983 ) :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the mean galaxy density and @xmath41 the density of points in the random catalog .",
    "hamilton ( 1994 ) suggested a slightly different estimator of @xmath2 less dependent on the density , and best suited to measure @xmath2 at large separations , which we adopted in paper i , and which we use also in this paper .",
    "this is what we will call in the following the `` direct '' estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "the galaxy two  point correlation function is well approximated by a power ",
    "law , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , at least at scales less than @xmath6 : this implies that the correlation dimension @xmath44 is @xmath45 .    as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "if the universe is a fractal , it is impossible to find a `` universal '' value of @xmath5 , because larger samples will have larger voids and a larger @xmath5 .",
    "for this reason pietronero ( 1987 ) has defined the conditional average density @xmath46 :    @xmath47    which measures the average density at distance @xmath12 from an occupied point .",
    "@xmath46 is in principle related to @xmath2 :    @xmath48    one implication ( trivial but important ) of relation ( [ eq : xigam ] ) is that , if @xmath2 is a power ",
    "law , @xmath46 is not , and vice  versa . moreover , there is a practical difference in the way of estimating the two functions ( see e.g. coleman & pietronero 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath46 is calculated only within the sample limits , while @xmath2 , as apparent from equation ( [ eq : nxi ] ) , is computed using random catalogs to correct for volume boundaries , thus implicitly assuming homogeneity .",
    "even if the universe is not a fractal , this can be a problem when the sample size is still small relatively to the scale where homogeneity is achieved ; as a consequence , an indirect estimate of @xmath46 obtained from @xmath2 through equation ( [ eq : xigam ] ) may be wrong .",
    "@xmath2 is however a simple statistical measure of clustering ; other useful functions representing variously defined integrals of @xmath2 can be directly measured on a sample .",
    "for example ,",
    "the mean number of objects @xmath49 in a volume @xmath50 centered on a randomly chosen object , is    @xmath51 dv = 4 \\pi \\int _ 0 ^r x^2 [ 1 + \\xi(x ) ] dx = nv + 4 \\pi j_3 \\label{eq : ncen}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the so  called @xmath53 integral :    @xmath54    @xmath55 represents the mean number of excess galaxies around a galaxy within a radius @xmath12 .",
    "another important integral quantity is the volume  averaged two ",
    "point correlation function @xmath56 :    @xmath57    contrarily to @xmath2 , @xmath56 is usually computed through counts in randomly placed spherical cells , taking into account only the spheres totally included within the sample boundaries .",
    "no random catalog is used , analogously to the estimate of @xmath46 .",
    "the equivalent of @xmath52 and @xmath56 in the fractal approach is the integrated conditional density @xmath58 defined as :    @xmath59    which  gives the behavior of the average density of a sphere of radius @xmath12 centered around an occupied point averaged over all occupied points \" ( coleman & pietronero 1992 ) .",
    "we notice that @xmath58 is related to @xmath52 : using relations ( [ eq : xigam ] ) , ( [ eq : j3 ] ) and ( [ eq : gammastar ] ) we have :    @xmath60 \\label{eq : gstarj3}\\ ] ]    which represents the integral counterpart of equation ( [ eq : xigam ] ) .    as in the case of @xmath2 , @xmath52",
    "is also computed using random samples , i.e. assuming homogeneity beyond the sample limits , so equation ( [ eq : gstarj3 ] ) can not be used to obtain @xmath58 from @xmath53 .",
    "assuming now that @xmath2 is a perfect power law , we have the following relations :    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    we have then :    @xmath63   = n [ 1 + \\frac{\\xi(r)}{(1-\\gamma/3 ) } ] \\label{eq : gstarximed}\\ ] ]    equations ( [ eq : j3xi][eq : gstarximed ] ) are useful because they allow us to estimate @xmath2 from the integral indicators ; in the next section we will use them , with equation ( [ eq : xigam ] ) , to compare the different functions we have defined above .",
    "a preliminary test and the easiest one in order to compute the fractal dimension of the galaxy distribution can be performed counting the number @xmath64 of objects within a distance @xmath12 from us : from equation ( [ eq : fracdens ] ) , we expect @xmath65 . the results for the 4 volume ",
    "limited ssrs2 samples with absolute magnitude limits @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath20 , are shown in figure [ fig : fracdens ] .",
    "a formal least  squares fit to the data gives @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ; the errors were computed through bootstrap resampling of the original samples .",
    "these results apparently tell us that from the shallowest to the deepest sample we have a change in the fractal dimension , with convergence to homogeneity . even considering the uncertainty associated to these values",
    ", we can conservatively state that such results are more consistent with homogeneity at scales @xmath0 , than with a fractal universe .",
    "we have also computed @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the same 4 volume  limited samples . in what follows we will use redshift space estimates .",
    "first of all , we are interested here in a relative comparison between different indicators , and not in determining a true value ; second , we want to compare our results with those of pietronero and collaborators , always performed in redshift space ; finally , the ssrs2 is not affected by large peculiar motions ( see willmer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : gamma ] .",
    "square fit in the small  scale range ( less than 10 ) gives a slope @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 . at larger scales ,",
    "the slope fluctuates from sample to sample , and within the same sample , but does not show a clear _ plateau _ ( as should be expected if homogeneity was reached ) ; moreover , positive values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are measured to larger scales for deeper samples .",
    "these results are consistent with those found by pietronero and collaborators on other catalogs .",
    "does all this mean that the universe is fractal , and that the hypothesis of large  scale homogeneity is falsified ?",
    "first of all , we have to take into account the behavior of @xmath64 we have discussed above , which is consistent with homogeneity at large scales . @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "are more general tests , as they average on all the galaxies , while @xmath64 is centered on our position ; nevertheless , with @xmath64 we can test larger scales ( @xmath77  ) , while @xmath73 and @xmath74 are limited to @xmath78 . at this scale",
    "we still have a positive correlation function ( see below ) and we should not expect to measure @xmath79 ; therefore what we can infer from all these tests is that there is still power at a scale of @xmath78 , but no evidence for significant power at @xmath0 .",
    "a further problem for the fractal model is the discrepancy between the slope of @xmath1 , which implies @xmath80 ( for the ssrs2 see our results in table 1 of paper i ) , and that of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , implying @xmath76 .",
    "smp claim that people fit @xmath1 in the  wrong range \" around @xmath5 , where @xmath1 would deviate from a power  law .",
    "we notice that people usually fit @xmath1 where it can be reasonably approximated by a power ",
    "law , excluding both small and large scales ; therefore the explanation of smp ( see their figure 9 ) does not seem plausible .    in interpreting these results , it should perhaps be taken into account an effect which is trivial but which we point out for sake of clarity . in figure",
    "[ fig : gammasim ] , we show @xmath2 and @xmath46 assuming that @xmath1 is a perfect power ",
    "law with @xmath81 , and points are obtained assuming an error of 20% .",
    "it is obvious that the quantity @xmath82 $ ] can be approximated by 2 power ",
    "laws ; in this case , in the range 210   it has a slope @xmath83 or @xmath84 . at larger scales , where @xmath2 becomes very small",
    ", @xmath85 becomes constant .",
    "however , in real samples @xmath1 deviates from a power  law at small and large scales ( see below ) , and the regime where @xmath46 is constant may not be reached .",
    "this simple exercise tells us that if @xmath1 is a genuine power ",
    "law , there is a range around @xmath5 where @xmath73 can be approximated by a power  law with a flatter slope , which is what is observed .",
    "we will check now the internal consistency between standard and non standard statistics , examining the behavior of the functions described in the previous section . in figure",
    "[ fig : xiall ] , for the volume limited subsample including all galaxies with @xmath68 , we show the values of @xmath1 estimated directly using the hamilton ( 1994 ) formula , from @xmath73 through equation ( [ eq : xigam ] ) , and from the integral functions @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath74 using equations ( [ eq : j3xi ] ) , ( [ eq : xibarxi ] ) , ( [ eq : gstarximed ] ) ( i.e. , assuming that @xmath1 is a perfect power law ) . in the standard scenario , all these estimates applied on the same sample should in principle measure the same quantity , and the only differences should be due to the biases introduced by each method ( this is why no error bars are shown in the figure ) .    figure [ fig : xiall ] shows that there are two main effects : at small scales , there is a systematic difference between the estimates of @xmath1 obtained from the integrated functions and the two estimates obtained directly or from @xmath73 ; at large scales , there is a systematic difference between the estimates based on random catalogs and the other ones which only take into account the volumes fully included within the sample limits .",
    "the direct estimate of @xmath1 is consistent with that computed from @xmath73 to about @xmath88 . at small scales",
    "peculiar motions affect @xmath1 , and the number of pairs at small separations becomes very small ; therefore we expect significant deviations of @xmath1 from a power ",
    "law , and this explains why the indirect estimates of @xmath1 from @xmath74 , @xmath87 , and @xmath86 based on the assumption of a perfect power  law , differ systematically from the other two estimates .    at scales larger than @xmath6   the estimates of @xmath1 obtained from @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath87 decline more rapidly than the direct estimate of @xmath1 and that obtained from @xmath86 .",
    "as the former indicators take into account only the volumes fully included within the sample limits , they are limited to smaller scales their maximum scale corresponds to the radius of the largest sphere which can be included in the sample ; moreover , at large scales the randomly placed spheres have a significant overlap , and are no more independent , thus giving a biased ( lower ) estimate of the variance .",
    "it can be noticed that the estimate of @xmath1 from @xmath73 drops somewhat more rapidly than the estimates from @xmath74 and @xmath87 , because the latter are derived from integral measures , thus are smoother and have a better signal to noise ratio .",
    "it is also clear that the estimate of @xmath1 from @xmath86 , which is an integrated measure and is based on random catalogs , can reach the largest scales , and appears to be consistent with a power  law extending to @xmath89 .",
    "the direct standard estimate of @xmath1 is noisier and oscillates ; it drops beyond @xmath88 , in a way similar to the integral estimates , then has a second oscillation , following the @xmath86 estimate .",
    "we can conclude from the above discussion that there is no disagreement between the results obtained with standard and non  standard indicators , when taking into account the range of validity of each one of them .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rc ] , for the volume  limited subsamples from @xmath90 to @xmath91 ( step 0.5 ) we show the correlation length @xmath5 , the first zero  point @xmath92 of @xmath1 ( i.e. the scale where @xmath1 becomes negative ) , and the radius of the largest sphere totally included in the sample , @xmath93 , as a function of the sample depth @xmath94 .",
    "the values of @xmath5 with their bootstrap error bars are the same as in figure [ fig : depth ] , while the values of @xmath92 simply correspond to the last bin where @xmath1 is positive , and their error bars indicate the bin width .    it is trivial that @xmath95 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath5 is not proportional to the depth , contrarily to what expected for a fractal ; the less deep subsamples are probably not `` fair '' , and @xmath5 may be underestimated ( even if a luminosity effect for low luminosity galaxies can not be excluded ) ; then @xmath5 is more or less constant in an intermediate range of luminosities , and increases rapidly ( more rapidly than the depth ) for samples including galaxies brighter than @xmath96 .",
    "this is the luminosity effect we have shown in paper i ( see also figure [ fig : depth ] ) .",
    "the most striking result of figure [ fig : rc ] is that the value of the zero ",
    "point @xmath92 clearly increases linearly with the depth , and that its value corresponds in a striking way to @xmath93 .",
    "this quantitative correspondence between @xmath92 and @xmath93 means that the standard estimate of the correlation function @xmath1 is in fact reliable only at scales smaller than the largest sphere contained in the sample : it is at this scale which @xmath1 is forced to become negative , then starts to oscillate .",
    "we stress that this effect should be taken into account ; often an oscillating correlation function is interpreted as evidence of a real characteristic scale , but if this scale corresponds to the @xmath93 of the sample taken into account , the unavoidable conclusion ( as in the case of our subsamples ) is that the real zero  point of @xmath1 has not been reached .",
    "are the results of our fractal analysis consistent with standard models of galaxy formation ?    the behavior of @xmath85 and @xmath97 can be checked by using n ",

    "@xmath101 shows the typical cutoff when approaching the radius of the largest sphere which can be contained in the sample : in fact , the deeper sample allows to recover power at larger scales .",
    "these results are comparable to our results on the ssrs2 , and also to those presented by smp .",
    "we have already mentioned that a problem for a simple fractal universe is the discrepancy between the fractal correlation dimension implied by @xmath1 , @xmath109 , and that derived from @xmath73 or @xmath74 , @xmath76 .",
    "we have also noted that such a discrepancy can not be due simply to an improper fitting of @xmath1 ( as claimed by smp ) in a range where it deviates from a power  law .",
    "now we have shown that the observed slopes of @xmath1 and @xmath73 can be reproduced by a standard cdm n  body simulation : this confirms the implications of our example in figure [ fig : gammasim ] , and the consistency of both @xmath1 and @xmath73 with gravitational clustering in a universe homogeneous at large  scale .",
    "we have not addressed , of course , the question of the variations of @xmath5 . in our simulation , @xmath5 at any fixed time has a unique , constant value ; when analyzing deeper subsamples of our simulation , @xmath5 rapidly converges to its true value ( no significant difference in fact is found in the value @xmath5 measured in a box of @xmath110   and in another at @xmath111 ) , while the scale of the zero  point increases significantly .",
    "as we have previously shown , in the real universe the correlation length @xmath5 of galaxies does depend on their luminosity ( or , in other terms , there is evidence of luminosity segregation ) .",
    "our simple answer to the criticism by smp ``the authors [ ... ] have never presented _ any quantitative argument that explains the shift of @xmath5 with sample size_'' , is that shallow samples are affected by the presence of local structures , as the discrepancy between the perseus ",
    "pisces and the other surveys reminds us ; moreover , when a sample is not deep enough , @xmath1 can be artificially truncated , thus affecting the estimate of @xmath5 ; finally , and it is our main quantitative argument , from figure [ fig : depth ] it is clear that @xmath5 does not depend on sample depth , but on galaxy luminosity ( as shown in paper i ) , for @xmath112 galaxies .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are various reasons why we should expect luminosity segregation .",
    "it has been shown that the correlation function can be amplified as a consequence of a  statistical bias \" ( kaiser 1984 ) , which can explain in a natural way the cluster autocorrelation function . as concerning galaxies , white et al .",
    "( 1987 ) used n  body simulations to show that more massive galaxies are more clustered ; they called this phenomenon `` natural bias '' . recent semi  analytical models ( mo & white 1996 , kauffmann et al .",
    "1997 ) predict this bias if galaxies form in sufficiently massive halos , with @xmath113 ; in this case , the trend is similar to that observed in the ssrs2 ( see figure 5 of paper i ) , even if they do not succeed in fitting both the low and high luminosity samples .",
    "this is not surprising , given all the theoretical uncertainties , particularly on the dark halo ",
    "galaxy relation .",
    "in addition to the luminosity  dependent correlation amplitude , there are other 2 important points which should be considered when analyzing the galaxy distribution : the k  correction and the cosmological model ( see guzzo 1997 ; scaramella et al .",
    "while in our analysis of the ssrs2 samples we have fixed an @xmath114 , @xmath115 model and systematically applied k  corrections , pietronero and collaborators usually perform their analysis in euclidean space and without k  correction . as concerning the cosmological model , for a fractal universe one should find and apply the appropriate formulae for an isotropic but inhomogeneous universe ( unless one wants to question the validity of general relativity ) . on the other hand , the k ",
    "correction is an empirical correction to the magnitude of a galaxy , as in a fixed wavelength range we observe different parts of the spectrum at different redshifts .",
    "the effect is still small in the deepest sample of the ssrs2 ; if we use euclidean distances and do not apply the k  correction , from the relation @xmath116 we find @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 .",
    "it becomes critical in deeper surveys as the eso slice project ( vettolani et al .",
    "1997 ; zucca et al .",
    "1997 ) , as shown by scaramella et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who do not confirm the results obtained by smp on that sample as well as on abell clusters .",
    "moreover , the k  correction can not be ignored when interpreting deep counts ; the claim by sylos labini et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that deep counts are consistent with a fractal distribution can be reversed , concluding that the agreement with the observed count slope would be lost if at least the k ",
    "correction had been applied ( not to speak of cosmological and evolutionary corrections : they are model  dependent , but we know that galaxies evolve )",
    ".    why do the choice of an euclidean space and the absence of a k  correction give results more consistent with a fractal distribution ?",
    "there are essentially two main reasons : first of all , euclidean distances become systematically larger than comoving ones at increasing redshift : this means also that one will have larger voids and structures .",
    "second , when applying the k ",
    "correction we can recover galaxies that otherwise would not have been included in a volume  limited subsample ; if the k  correction is not applied , a systematically larger fraction of galaxies will be lost at larger distances .",
    "the combination of the two effects lowers the density at increasing redshift , and flattens the slope of the @xmath119 relation , thus following the same trend of a fractal distribution .",
    "in this paper , we have carefully examined the claim that the universe is a fractal , analyzing the ssrs2 and using the same statistical approach of pietronero and collaborators .      *",
    "the ssrs2 has a luminosity dependent correlation amplitude ; * results obtained with the standard and fractal approach give consistent results ; * concerning large  scale homogeneity ,",
    "observational evidence is for the moment consistent with theoretical predictions derived from standard cdm models of galaxy formation , and does not require a fractal universe ; * on the other hand , the first zero  point of the correlation function we measure in ssrs2 volume  limited subsamples increases linearly with the sample depth , and has approximately the same value of the radius of the largest sphere which can be included in the sample .",
    "this implies that the zero  point of @xmath1 is beyond 40 , a lower limit set by very luminous galaxies ( see benoist et al .",
    "1996 ; cappi et al .",
    "1998 ) and consistent with results from clusters ( e.g. cappi & maurogordato 1992 ) ; on this point , we agree with smp that measurements of @xmath1 beyond a scale corresponding to the radius of the largest sphere included in the sample are not reliable .    we conclude that the dependence of the galaxy correlation function on the galaxy luminosity and the power still present at large scales ( @xmath120 ) can satisfactorily explain those effects interpreted by smp as evidence of an inhomogeneous , fractal universe ."
