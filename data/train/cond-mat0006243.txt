    "recently much attention has been paid to the structure and dynamics of polymer chains restricted by two surfaces , or restricted in cylindrical pores @xcite .",
    "these conditions are relevant to a broad class of applications and biological functions , such as filtration , gel permeation chromatography , heterogeneous catalysis , oil recuperation .",
    "when a polymer is confined to a smaller space , the entropy loss of a chain is higher .",
    "here we call this simple rule the _ polymer confinement rule_. it has been employed casually in the literature , however , it has a close connection with the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , on a theoretical side , quantum mechanical wave equations have been applied to elucidate the behavior of the gaussian chains when the radius of gyration of a chain is much larger than these structures .",
    "therefore , the solutions of wave equations in some geometries are useful both for mesoscopic quantum physics and polymer physics .",
    "the most prominent recent example is the calculation for curved geometries .",
    "goldstone and jaffe @xcite have shown that the bend of two and three dimensional tubes with a constant cross section lowers the ground state energy of a quantum particle constrained in the tubes .",
    "correspondingly , the cylindrical bend of two parallel walls ( 2d tube ) with a constant width reduces the entropy loss @xcite .",

    "have shown in their series of works that entropic interactions between curved membranes and macromolecules such as flexible chain molecules and rigid rods may change the bare elastic constants of single membranes and bilayers @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on tubes in two and three dimensions with sinusoidal undulations keeping tube volumes constant .",
    "this lowers the ground state energy of quantum particles , and thus raises the entropy of gaussian polymer chains .",
    "corrugated walls induce additional kinetic energy along the walls , however , if bulges are formed , the waves are less confined in the transverse direction and localized in the bulges , which may decrease the total energy because of the uncertainty principle . in the same way , according to the polymer confinement rule , polymer chains may favor the undulations of tubes .    in section",
    "ii , we first describe the polymer confinement rule , an intuitive argument for why a polymer in a confined space loses entropy .",
    "this approach is microscopic , which is different from the well - known scaling argument@xcite .",
    "second , we provide the calculation procedure for gaussian chains using quantum mechanics which is given in ref.@xcite . in section iii , we elucidate the effect of undulations using the variational method .",
    "we show that the wave equations have lower energy under long wavelength undulations .",
    "correspondingly , long gaussian chains acquire higher entropy with undulating constraints than with exactly flat or straight ones .",
    "for the three dimensional case , we compare the undulation effect with the rayleigh area - minimizing instability @xcite . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss implications of polymer - mediated entropic force for membrane boxes and tubes .",
    "the entropy reduction of a confined random walk of @xmath0 steps between two parallel flat walls ( distance @xmath1 ) can be derived intuitively through the following microscopic reasoning .",
    "the number of steps that span the distance between the walls is described by @xmath2 , and the gyration radius in a free space @xmath3 is expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a step length . here",
    "@xmath6 implies that the numerical factors have been ignored .",
    "steps touching the walls should return .",
    "this requirement is the source of the entropy reduction @xcite .",
    "the chain reflects off the walls about @xmath7 times .",
    "let @xmath8 be the number of nearest positions on a lattice for a step .",
    "then the number @xmath9 of total configurations of the confined chain is represented by @xmath10 where the combination factor has been omitted .",
    "then the entropy loss due to the walls for the gaussian chain is @xmath11 .",
    "we write @xmath12 which corresponds to the uncertainty principle : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the energy , position , momentum and mass of a quantum particle , and @xmath18 is the planck constant . on this basis",
    ", one can say that a polymer tends to escape from narrower spaces into wider or open spaces ; in other words , the polymer tends to localize in wider spaces of the confined geometries , the same as with quantum particles .      for a random walk , we consider the total number of paths that connect @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath0 steps , @xmath21 , where @xmath8 is the number of neighboring sites .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath22 it is easy to show @xmath23 is the solution of the diffusion equation : @xmath24 where @xmath5 is the lattice constant , or the step length .    with the eigenfunction expansion :",
    "@xmath25 then , the problem reduces to the wave equation , @xmath26 with the boundary conditions .",
    "as is known , the eigenfunctions satisfy the orthogonality and completeness conditions : @xmath27 since the continuous limit is @xmath28 eq.([g ] ) satisfies the boundary condition eq.([bdcond ] ) .",
    "for excited states ( @xmath29 ) , when an equality @xmath30 is satisfied , the situation is called ground state dominance , which is our interest in this paper",
    ". then we have , @xmath31    the partition function is a sum over all configurations : @xmath32 integrating out all uninteresting degrees of freedom , and we obtain the main term in the associated entropy change , @xmath33    for a gaussian chain between two flat walls , the discrete part of the eigenvalues of eq.([wave ] ) is @xmath34 to obtain the main term , we ignore the continuous part of the eigenvalues associated with two directions along walls .",
    "then eq.([gsd ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "thus , we have @xmath35 this is consistent with eq.([pqr ] ) .",
    "let @xmath36 be a tube in two dimensions ( box ) or in three dimensions .",
    "we will consider the wave equation , @xmath37 in @xmath36 subjected to the dirichlet condition on walls : @xmath38 . the following calculations are applicable to both quantum particles and gaussian polymers .",
    "we define @xmath39 \\equiv \\left ( \\int_{c}d^d{\\bf r } \\psi \\nabla^2 \\psi \\right ) \\cdot \\left ( \\int_{c}d^d{\\bf r } \\psi^2 \\right)^{-1 } , \\label{e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the dimension of the system .",
    "our aim is to show @xmath41\\equiv\\sigma[\\psi ] - \\sigma_0>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 corresponds to the ground state for the exactly flat or straight case .",
    "since perturbations are sinusoidal , the integrals can be limited to a single wavelength , that of the perturbations .",
    "we compute a critical wavelength , down to which @xmath43 $ ] is positive .",
    "our evaluation gives an upper bound for the critical wavelength , because we employ a trial function for @xmath44 in eq.([e ] ) .",

    "it is a quite reasonable value , because , in terms of quantum mechanics , if the undulation is shorter than @xmath68 , then the kinetic energy along walls will be higher than the confinement energy .",
    "it was shown by plateau , later pursued by rayleigh , then known as the rayleigh instability , that the undulation of a tube with wavelength exceeding its circumferences reduces the surface area .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare the polymer - mediated instability and the rayleigh instability .",
    "consider a tube of unperturbed radius @xmath72 and an undulation function ( fig.2 ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is determined by the constant volume condition of the tube .",
    "thus , @xmath76    in order to remind readers of the rayleigh instability , we calculate the surface area of the tube given by @xmath77 we expand the square root for small perturbations and use eq.([rad ] ) .",
    "the area is @xmath78.\\ ] ] therefore , if the wavelength is greater than the circumference of the tube , the area is less than that of the unperturbed perfect cylinder .",

    "thus , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the ratio of the critical wavelength to that of the rayleigh instability .",
    "then the minimum @xmath97 is @xmath98 the critical wavelength is shorter than that of the rayleigh instability .",
    "we have shown that quantum mechanical particles confined in undulated boxes or tubes have lower energy , when the wavelength is greater than certain values , comparable to the width between walls or the radius of tubes .",
    "we have explained that the effect can easily be interpreted by the uncertainty principle .",
    "quantum mechanical calculations immediately imply that long gaussian chains in undulated boxes or tubes acquire higher entropy than in exactly flat or straight ones .",
    "furthermore , it can be explained by the polymer confinement rule established in this paper , which is quite analogous to the uncertainty principle .",
    "this polymer - mediated entropic force may play an important role in a number of systems : polymers in cell membranes , vesicles , microemulsions , and polymers confined in lamellar or cylindrical phases of surfactant and homopolymers blending into those of block copolymer systems . for instance , deformable flat membrane boxes with constant width @xmath50 containing the gaussian chains ( @xmath99 ) are unstable against the undulations . in the same way , cylindrical tubes with radius @xmath100 containing the gaussian chains ( @xmath101 ) are unstable against the undulations . from eqs.([last1 ] ) and ( [ last2 ] ) , it is easy to see that the entropy gain increases with increasing undulation amplitude",
    ". therefore , the undulation amplitude will grow until it is balanced by the elastic restoring force of the membrane , or until the membrane ruptures .",
    "in addition , the critical wavelength is shorter than that of the rayleigh area - minimizing instability ; the polymer - mediated interaction may trigger the undulation instability .    when the bare elastic modulus of a membrane is not small , for long wavelength undulations , the effect softens the surface tension of the membrane box . on the other hand , for short wavelength undulations , the effect hardens the surface tension because of the reduction of the entropy of confined polymers .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the discrimination point of softening or hardening ( instabilizing or stabilizing ) is determined by the distance between membranes .",
    "one should be careful to interpret our results .",
    "first , because of the volume preserving condition , the undulation is not a simple expansion of membrane boxes or tubes by the thermal motion of polymers .",
    "second , the calculation of wave equations does not correspond to the case when the wave length of undulations is longer than confined polymer sizes in boxes or tubes .",
    "the polymer - mediated entropic force without undulations is proportional to @xmath102 , where @xmath50 is the distance between walls , which decays slower than van der waals attractive interactions .",
    "this force is something like the excluded volume interactions of multimembranes systems known as the helflich repulsive interaction . finally , the polymer confinement rule for excluded volume chains is modified as @xmath103 .",
    "we expect that the same entropic effect will exist for excluded volume chains .",
    "to tackle the integration of eqs.([a1])-([a2 ] ) , we define an integral : @xmath104 by using a formula , @xmath105 we have @xmath106 hence , it yields @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath36 are defined in eqs.([abc])@xmath109([abcd ] ) .",
    "in this appendix , we provide some integrals of the bessel functions . by using @xmath110 and @xmath111 , it is easy to verify the following integrals : @xmath112 , \\\\",
