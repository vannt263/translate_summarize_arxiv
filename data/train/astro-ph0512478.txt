    "millimeter - wave observations of disks surrounding pre - main sequence stars are a promising probe of the planet formation process @xcite . while most studies have concentrated on the circumstellar disks around low mass t tauri stars , far less is known about the disks around their intermediate mass counterparts , the herbig ae / be stars .",
    "better characterization of the circumstellar disks around these higher mass stars will help address how stellar mass affects the development of planetary systems .",
    "detailed modeling of the spectral energy distributions of herbig ae / be stars has generally supported the protoplanetary disk paradigm ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "but out of the large sample of herbig ae / be star disk candidates recognized by infrared excess from circumstellar dust @xcite , only a handful have been spatially and spectrally resolved through direct imaging observations to show clear signatures of rotationally supported disks of solar system size @xcite .",
    "the emission line star hd169142 ( sao 186777 , mwc 925 ; spectral type a5 ) with infrared excess ( iras 18213 - 2948 ) was included in the @xcite catalog of 287 herbig ae / be candidates .",
    "subsequent photometric and spectroscopic observations filled out its spectral energy distribution at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths @xcite . at @xmath6  pc distance , hd169142 is notably isolated from any molecular cloud or extensive reflection nebulosity , though @xcite used differential polarimetry to detect a @xmath7  au ( @xmath1 ) diameter circular halo of scattered light .",
    "while some doubt lingers as to the pre - main - sequence nature of hd169142 , it is among isolated herbig ae stars selected by @xcite and classified as `` group ib '' with a strong mid - infrared component , and a conspicuous absence of 10  @xmath8 m silicate emission @xcite .",
    "this star also has prominent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of hd169142 is well fit by a passive irradiated disk model , though the near - infrared flux seems low , perhaps because the inner disk rim is viewed pole - on @xcite , or perhaps because extensive inner disk clearing is underway , possibly together with planet formation .",
    "the relative isolation of this star from any molecular clouds may indicate an advanced pre - main - sequence age .",
    "a circumstellar molecular component is detected via relatively strong emission in the co j=3 - 2 line , with the narrow co line profile modeled with a near face - on disk @xcite .",
    "here we present high resolution observations of hd169142 from the submillimeter array ( sma ) that clearly resolve a circumstellar disk in keplerian rotation .",
    "we derive the basic disk properties from arcsecond resolution images of the @xmath0co j=2 - 1 line using radiative transfer calculations based on a flared , passive disk model @xcite .",
    "we used the sma @xcite to observe hd169142 on 19 april 2005 .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] lists the observational parameters .",
    "seven antennas were available in an extended configuration that provided a baseline range of 27 to 181 meters and a synthesized beam of @xmath9 at position angle @xmath10 .",
    "the target source was tracked over the hour angle range -1.0 to 3.5 .",
    "weather conditions were excellent , and system temperatures ranged from 85 to 150 k ( dsb ) .",
    "the correlator provided 2 ghz of bandwidth in each sideband and was configured to include the @xmath0co j=2 - 1 line at 230.538 ghz in the upper sideband in a 104 mhz spectral `` chunk '' with channel spacing 0.2 mhz ( @xmath110.27 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "complex gain calibration was performed using the calibrator sources j1911 - 201 and j1924 - 292 .",
    "passband calibration was done with observations of the strong sources 3c279 and uranus .",
    "the absolute flux scale was set using observations of callisto and is estimated to be accurate to about 10% .",
    "all of the calibration was done using mir software , followed by standard imaging and visual analysis using the miriad package .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : co21+cont]a shows the continuum image made from the upper sideband visibility data .",
    "fitting an elliptical gaussian to the visibilities gives a flux of @xmath13 mjy , and a fwhm size of @xmath14 .",
    "the fit does not indicate any significant ellipticity .",
    "the observed flux is consistent with the previous single dish 1.3  mm measurement of @xmath15  mjy @xcite taking account of the uncertainties , which suggests that the interferometer is not missing any large scale emission .",
    "the 1.3  mm continuum emission arises from a compact region , which we associate with the circumstellar disk .",
    "the spectral energy distribution indicates that thermal dust emission strongly dominates at this wavelength ; any contribution from ionized gas emission is negligible .",
    "the dust continuum flux , @xmath16 , may be used to estimate the disk mass , @xmath17 , assuming optically thin emission , i.e. @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the planck function .",
    "we adopt the mass opacity of @xcite , @xmath20 = 0.02(1.3 mm/@xmath21 ) @xmath22  g  @xmath12 , which includes a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "assuming an average temperature @xmath23  k , appropriate for the bulk of the disk material , the disk mass is @xmath24 .",
    "the factor of few uncertainty in @xmath20 likely dominates the uncertainty in this mass estimate .",
    "this mass estimate falls in the middle of the range of estimates for protoplanetary disks around t tauri stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : co21+cont]a shows the co j=2 - 1 line emission distribution over the velocity range with significant emission .",
    "the images show an approximately symmetric pattern around the central velocity of @xmath25  km  s@xmath12 . at the extremes ,",
    "the emission is centered at the continuum peak position , while at intermediate velocities the emission shows a gradient oriented slightly east of north that at the central velocities separates into two peaks .",
    "figure  [ fig : co21-spec ] shows the spectrum of the co j=2 - 1 line convolved to a beam size of @xmath26 , which encompasses the full spatial extent of the emission .",
    "the spectral profile is double peaked .",
    "all of these features taken together strongly suggest a disk at low inclination to the line - of - sight in keplerian rotation , as calculated by @xcite , where low j co lines have high optical depth and trace gas temperature near the disk surface .",
    "a keplerian velocity field is appropriate for the estimated low disk mass relative to the central star mass , i.e. @xmath27 .      in order to verify the keplerian nature of the observed rotation of the outer disk material , and to provide quantitative constraints on the basic disk parameters , we performed a series of radiative transfer calculations based on a physical model selected from the catalog of irradiated accretion disk models of @xcite .",
    "we selected the model that @xcite found to closely match the spectral energy distribution of hd169142 . in this model ,",
    "the central star parameters are @xmath28  k , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and age 10  myr , which are well matched to the stellar properties of hd169142 .",
    "the disk has a mass accretion rate of @xmath31  yr@xmath12 , with viscosity parameter , @xmath32 .",
    "the dust in the disk is well mixed with the gas and has a power law size distribution @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with sizes ranging from @xmath35  @xmath8 m and @xmath36  mm .",
    "we identified an optimal disk radius , inclination , and orientation on the plane of the sky , and co abundance by performing a chi - squared minimization , comparing the sma visibility data and visibilities derived from a grid of disk models spanning a range for each parameter .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations were done with the 2d accelerated monte carlo code of @xcite to generate simulated data cubes from which visibilities were derived at the @xmath37 points observed by the sma for the calculation of the chi - squared metric .",
    "the ( dust ) temperature and density values from the model were re - binned and truncated for a range of outer disk radii from 150 to 400 au , based on the extent seen in the co j=2 - 1 images . because of beam dilution",
    ", these data do not constrain the inner disk radius .",
    "the narrow line width suggests a viewing angle close to face - on for the disk , and we explored a range of inclinations from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "the turbulent component of the velocity field was fixed at the low value of 0.12  km  s@xmath12 , less than the resolution of the data .",
    "the co abundance is characterized by a depletion factor from the nominal dark cloud abundance of @xmath40 with respect to molecular hydrogen .",
    "we find a best fit disk model with radius @xmath41  au and inclination @xmath42 , oriented at position angle @xmath43 , with a co abundance of @xmath44 ( depletion factor 4 ) .",
    "we assign uncertainties to the fitted parameters that are somewhat larger than the formal uncertainties based on visual examination of the model images and their residuals .",
    "table  [ tab : model ] summarizes the model parameters . figure  [ fig : co21+cont]b shows the velocity channel maps from simulated observations of the best fit model .",
    "the keplerian disk model clearly captures the main features visible in the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : co21-spec ] shows the spectrum at @xmath26 resolution derived from the model , overlayed on the data .",
    "this comparison gives an impression of differences integrated over the full spatial extent of disk emission .",
    "the derived low inclination is compatible with the lack of detectable ellipticity in the 1.3 millimeter dust emission , as well as the approximately circular appearance of the polarized scattered optical light nebula .",
    "the derived disk outer radius of 235 au is larger than the 130  au inferred from unresolved single dish co j=3 - 2 data @xcite , though somewhat smaller than those found for other resolved pre - main - sequence a star systems , for example 545  au for mwc480 @xcite or 835 au for hd34282 @xcite , and comparable to some lower mass t tauri star disks @xcite .",
    "the modestly depleted co abundance in this disk is similar to values typically found for the keplerian disks around t tauri stars , for example @xmath45 derived for the dm tau disk by dutrey et al . (",
    "1997 )    the channel maps present minor asymmetries and irregularities that are not reproduced by the simple , smooth , keplerian model .",
    "however , there are no dramatic departures from this equilibrium configuration like those seen in the circumstellar material around ab aur , which is perhaps a considerably younger herbig ae star @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : co21+cont]c shows images made from the difference between the disk model and the data for each channel .",
    "these difference images show faint , extended emission in the data at blueshifted velocities , and slight excess in central peak brightness at redshifted velocities .",
    "these differences between the data and the model are not especially significant , but they may reflect real source structure .",
    "observations with higher sensitivity and higher angular resolution will be needed to be more definitive .",
    "we have imaged the herbig ae star hd169142 in 1.3  millimeter continuum emission and @xmath0co j=2 - 1 line emission at @xmath1 resolution .",
    "these observations resolve a disk of molecular gas in keplerian rotation around the star .",
    "the presence of the disk is strong evidence that hd169142 is a _ bona fide _ pre - main - sequence star , despite its distance from any molecular cloud .",
    "the star s spectral energy distribution , isolation , and the regularity of its disk velocity field suggest an advanced pre - main - sequence evolutionary state .",
    "the millimeter dust emission indicates a mass of @xmath2  @xmath3 for the disk .",
    "modeling the co line emission shows that the disk has an outer radius of 235  au and is viewed close to face - on , compatible with an associated scattered light nebula seen with differential polarimetry .",
    "the disk mass , size , and co depletion are in line with those found for resolved keplerian disks around other young stars .",
