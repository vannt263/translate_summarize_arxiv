    "in the early epoch of universe , the space is filled with high energy partons , whose thermal energy is larger than @xmath0 @xcite , which enables us to assume the asymptotic freedom of partons . in this paper , we assume that partons are approximately expressed with hard spheres under the asymptotic freedom of partons in the early epoch of universe to simplify our discussion .",

    "of course , such an assumption of flat spacetime is inadequate to discuss the thermal conduction and convection of thermally relativistic fluids under the gravitational force in the early epoch of universe , because spacetime is markedly curved in the early epoch of universe @xcite .",
