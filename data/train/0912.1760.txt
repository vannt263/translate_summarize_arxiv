    "half - metallic ferromagnets with high ( room temperature and above ) curie temperatures @xmath1 are ideal for spintronics applications , and as such , much experimental and theoretical@xcite effort has been devoted in recent years to the designing of and search for such materials . among these ,",
    "cr - doped dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite or cr - based alloys and in particular cras and crsb @xcite in zinc blende(zb ) structure have attracted particular attention , not only because of the possibility of complete spin polarization of the carriers at the fermi level , but also for their possible high @xmath1 .",
    "akinaga @xcite were able to grow zb thin films of cras on gaas ( 001 ) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy , which showed ferromagnetic behavior at temperatures in excess of 400 k and magnetic moments of 3@xmath2 per cras unit .",
    "theoretical calculations by akinaga @xcite and several other theoretical calculations since then @xcite have verified the half - metallic character of cras .",
    "the high value of @xmath1 has also been supported by some of these studies@xcite .",
    "thin films of crsb grown by solid - source molecular beam epitaxy on gaas , ( al , ga)sb , and gasb have been found to be of zb structure and ferromagnetic with @xmath1 higher than 400 k@xcite .",
    "galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite , motivated by the successful fabrication of zb cras , crsb and mnas@xcite , have examined the possibility of half - metallic behavior in ordered zb compounds of transition metals v , cr and mn with the @xmath3 elements n , p , as , sb , s , se and te .",
    "their theoretical study shows that the half - metallic ferromagnetic character of these compounds is preserved over a wide range of lattice parameters .",
    "they also found that the half - metallic character is maintained for the transition element terminated ( 001 ) surfaces of these systems .",
    "yamana @xcite have studied the effects of tetragonal distortion on zb cras and crsb and found the half - metallicity to survive large tetragonal distortions .",
    "of course , the ground states of many of these compounds in the bulk are known to be different from the zb structure , the most common structure being the hexagonal nias - type .",
    "zhao and zunger@xcite have argued that zb mnas , cras , crsb , and crte are epitaxially unstable against the nias structure , and zb crse is epitaxially stable only for lattice constants higher than 6.2  , remaining half - metallic at such volumes .",
    "they also find that even though the ground state of crs is zb , it is antiferromagnetic at equilibrium lattice parameter , and thus not half - metallic .",
    "these results reveal the challenge experimentalists face in synthesizing these compounds in zb structure .",
    "however , the possibility remains open that such difficulties will be overcome with progress in techniques of film - growth and materials preparation in general .",
    "recently , deng @xcite were successful in increasing the thickness of zb - crsb films to @xmath4 3 nm by molecular beam epitaxy using ( in , ga)as buffer layers , and li @xcite were able to grow @xmath4 4 nm thick zb - crsb films on nacl ( 100 ) substrates .    in view of the above situation regarding the state of experimental fabrication of these compounds and available theoretical results , it would be appropriate to study the variation of magnetic properties , particularly exchange interactions and the curie temperature , of cr - based pnictides and chalcogenides as a function of the lattice parameter . towards this goal ,",
    "we have carried out such calculations for the compounds crx ( x = as , sb , s , se and te ) and the mixed alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 with x = sb , s , se and te .",
    "essentially we study the effect of anion doping by choosing elements of similar atomic sizes ( neighboring elements in the periodic table ) , one of which , namely sb , is isoelectronic to as , while the others ( s , se , te ) bring one more valence electron to the system .",
    "the mixed pnictide - chalcogenide systems offer further opportunity to study the effects of anion doping .",
    "the alloying with other 3d transition metals ( both magnetic , e.g. fe or mn , or non - magnetic , e.g. v ) on cation sublattice would also change the carrier concentration and bring about strong d - disorder which can additionally modify the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "this , however , is not the subject of the present paper .",
    "almost all theoretical studies on these alloys so far address aspects of electronic structure and stability of these alloys only .",
    "although a few theoretical estimates of exchange interactions and the curie temperature for cras at equilibrium lattice parameter have appeared in the literature , a detailed study of the volume dependence of these quantities is missing . for the other alloys , crsb ,",
    "crs , crse and crte , no theoretical results for the exchange interaction , curie temperature and their volume dependence exist at present .",
    "the mixed pnictide - chalcogenide systems offer the possibility of not only creating these alloys over a larger range of the lattice parameter , but also with a larger variation in the exchange interactions .",
    "this is because at low values of the lattice parameter the dominant cr - cr exchange interactions in the chalcogenides can be antiferromagnetic , while for the pnictides they are ferromagnetic .",
    "the pnictide - chalcogenide alloying is important from the experimental viewpoint of stabilizing the zb structure on a given substrate , via the matching of the lattice parameter of the film with that of the latter .",
    "although the present study is confined to the zb structure only , we hope that it will provide some guidance to the experimentalists in their search and growth of materials suitable for spintronic devices .",
    "electronic and magnetic properties of crx ( x = as , sb , s , se and te ) and cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x= sb , s , se and te ) were calculated for lattice parameters varying between 5.45 and 6.6  , appropriate for some typical ii - vi and iii - v semiconducting substrates .",
    "calculations were performed using the tb - lmto - cpa method@xcite and the exchange - correlation potential given by vosko , wilk and nusair@xcite . in our lmto calculation",
    "we optimize the asa ( atomic sphere approximation ) errors by including empty spheres in the unit cell .",
    "we use the fcc unit cell , with cr and x ( as , sb , s , se and te ) atoms located at ( 0,0,0 ) and ( 0.25,0.25,0.25 ) , respectively , and empty spheres at locations ( 0.5,0.5,0.5 ) and ( -0.25,-0.25,-0.25 ) . for several cases ,",
    "we have checked the accuracy of the lmto - asa electronic structures against the full - potential lmto results@xcite and found them to be satisfactory . for the mixed alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x= sb ,",
    "s , se and te ) , the as - sublattice of the zb cras structure is assumed to be randomly occupied by equal concentration of as and x atoms .",
    "the disorder in this sublattice is treated under the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite .",
    "our spin - polarized calculations assume a collinear magnetic model . in",
    "the following we will present results referred to as fm and dlm .",
    "the fm results follow from the usual spin - polarized calculations , where self - consistency of charge- and spin - density yields a nonzero magnetization per unit cell .",
    "although we call this the fm result , our procedure does not guarantee that the true ground state of the system is ferromagnetic , with the magnetic moments of all the unit cells perfectly aligned .",
    "this is because we have not explored non - collinear magnetic states , nor all antiferromagnetic ( afm ) states attainable within the collinear model .",
    "indeed , our results for the exchange interactions in some cases do suggest the ground states being of afm or complex magnetic nature . for lack of a suitable label",
    ", we refer to all spin - polarized calculations giving a nonzero local moment as fm state calculations . within the stoner model , a nonmagnetic state above the curie temperature @xmath1",
    "would be characterized by the vanishing of the local moments in magnitude .",
    "it is well - known and universally accepted that the neglect of the transversal spin fluctuations in the stoner model leads to an unphysical picture of the nonmagnetic state and a gross overestimate of @xmath1 .",
    "an alternate description of the nonmagnetic state is provided by the disordered local moment ( dlm ) model , where the local moments remain nonzero in magnitude above @xmath1 , but disorder in magnitude as well as their direction above @xmath1 causes the global magnetic moment to vanish .",
    "combining aspects of the stoner model and an itinerant heisenberg - like model , heine and co - workers@xcite have developed a suitable criterion for a dlm state to be a more appropriate description of the nonmagnetic state than what is given by the stoner model . within the collinear magnetic model , where all local axes of spin - quantization point in the same direction , dlm can be treated as a binary alloy problem and",
    "thus described using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite . we have carried out such dlm calculations , assuming the cr - sublattice to be randomly occupied by an equal number of cr atoms with oppositely directed magnetic moments .",
    "the object for performing the dlm calculations is two - fold .",
    "if the total energy in a dlm calculation is lower than the corresponding fm calculation , we can safely assume that the ground state ( for the given lattice parameter and structure ) is not fm , albeit of unknown magnetic structure .",
    "the exchange interactions in the dlm state can also be used to compute estimates of @xmath1 , and such estimates of @xmath1 may be considered as estimates from above the magnetic - nonmagnetic transition .",
    "@xmath1 computed from exchange interactions in the fm state are estimates from below the transition .",
    "of course , if the ground state is known to be ferromagnetic , then estimates of @xmath1 based on exchange interactions in the fm reference state are the appropriate ones to consider .    in some cases where the fm results point to the possibility of the ground state magnetic structure being afm or of complex nature",
    ", we have carried out a limited number of afm calculations to provide some insight into this problem ( see section [ subsec : stabilityjq ] ) .",
    "we have computed the spin - resolved densities of states ( dos ) for all the alloys for varying lattice parameters , and for both the fm and dlm configurations .",
    "the fm calculations show half - metallic character , due to the formation of bonding and antibonding states involving the @xmath5 orbitals of the cr - atoms and the @xmath3 orbitals of the neighboring pnictogen ( as , sb ) or chalcogen ( s , se , te ) .",
    "the hybridization gap is different and takes place in different energy regions in the two spin channels .",
    "the critical values of the lattice parameters above which the fm calculations show half - metallic character agree well with those reported by galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite .",
    "the dos for the alloys of the type crx ( x = sb , s , se , te ) have been presented by several other authors@xcite and thus will not be shown here . in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show the dos for the mixed alloys cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 and cras@xmath0se@xmath0 , for lattice parameters above and below the critical values for the half - metallic character . according to galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite , half - metallicity in zb cras appears between the lattice parameters of 5.45 and 5.65  .",
    "the latter corresponds to the lattice parameter of the gaas substrate . for crsb",
    "half - metallicity appears at a lattice parameter between 5.65 and 5.87  .",
    "the mixed alloy cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , is not quite half - metallic at the lattice parameter of 5.65  , and fully half - metallic at the lattice parameter of 5.76  .",
    "replacing sb with se in the above alloy , i.e. for cras@xmath0se@xmath0 , brings the critical lattice parameter down slightly . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , at a lattice parameter of 5.65  , cras@xmath0se@xmath0 is half - metallic , although barely so . in our calculation",
    "crs and crse are half - metallic at a lattice parameter of 5.65  , and not so at a lattice parameter of 5.55  .",
    "crte is not half - metallic at a lattice parameter of 5.76  , but at a lattice parameter of 5.87  .",
    "for both crs and crse the critical value should be close to 5.65  , and for crte it should be close to 5.87  .    note that in general the half - metallic gap is larger in the chalcogenides than in the pnictides .",
    "this is due to larger cr - moment ( see section [ sec : mag.mom .",
    "] ) for the chalcogenides , which results in larger exchange splitting .",
    "this explains the difference in the half - metallic gaps in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for similar lattice parameters .    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] compares the total dos of cras for the fm and dlm calculations for the equilibrium lattice parameter 5.65  .",
    "higher dos at the fermi level for the dlm calculation , compared with the fm calculation , is an indication that the band energy is lower in the fm state . indeed , as indicated in table [ table1 ] , compared with the dlm state the total energy for zb cras is lower in the fm state for the lattice parameters from 5.44 to 5.98  .",
    "in fact , this holds for lattice parameters up to 6.62  , showing the robustness of ferromagnetism in cras over a wide range of the lattice parameter .",
    "this is also true for crsb .",

    "the purpose of tabulating these energies is not to determine the bulk equilibrium lattice parameters in the zb structure , as this has already been done by several authors@xcite .",
    "our results for equilibrium zb phase lattice parameters agree with those found by galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite .",
    "the important point is that for crs and crse at low values of lattice parameters the dlm energies are lower than the fm energies , showing clearly that the fm configuration is unstable .",
    "the result for crs is in line with the observation by zhao and zunger@xcite , who find zb crs to be antiferromagnetic with an equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.37  .",
    "as shown later ( section [ sec : exchange ] ) , the exchange coupling constants for the cr atoms in the fm calculations are negative , indicating the instability of the ferromagnetic spin alignment . the tendency to antiferromagnetism in crse at compressed lattice parameters",
    "is also revealed in a study by sasaio@xmath7lu @xcite for crte at lower lattice parameters the fm energy is lower than the dlm energy , but the exchange constants for the cr - atoms in the fm calculations are still negative ( see discussion in section [ sec : exchange ] ) , signaling the possibility of the ground states in crte at low values of the lattice parameter being neither dlm nor fm .",
    "note that in our discussion ground state implies the lowest energy state in zb structure . for crs ,",
    "crse and crte the ground states at low lattice parameters can be of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) or complex magnetic structure .",
    "a lower total energy may also mean a lower band energy , and in some cases , the latter may be reflected in a lower density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig4 ] , where for crs at the lowest lattice parameter of 5.44 @xmath6 the dos at the fermi level is lower in the dlm state than in the fm state .",
    "the deviation from ferromagnetism at low values of the lattice parameter for crs , crse and crte is also revealed by our study of the lattice fourier transform of the exchange interaction between the cr atoms in the fm state ( section [ sec : exchange ] ) .",
    "the search for an antiferromagnetic state with lower energy is possible within our collinear magnetic model by enlarging the unit cell in various ways .",
    "we have pursued this issue to a limited extent , by considering 001 , 111 afm configurations for crs , crse and crte at low values of the lattice parameter ( see discussion in section[sec : exchange ] ) .",
    "a satisfactory resolution of such issues is possible only by going beyond the collinear model .",

    "one of the most widely used mapping procedures is due to liechtenstein @xcite it involves writing the change in the energy due to the deviation of a single spin from a reference state in an analytic form using the multiple scattering formalism and by appealing to the magnetic variant of the andersen force theorem@xcite .",
    "the force theorem , derived originally for the change of total energy due to a deformation in a solid , dictates that the differences in the energies of various magnetic configurations can be approximated by the differences in the band energies alone@xcite .",

    "<S> we present calculations of the exchange interactions and curie temperatures in cr - based pnictides and chalcogenides of the form crx with x = as , sb , s , se and te , and the mixed alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 with x = sb , s , se , and te . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are performed for zinc blende ( zb ) structure for 12 values of the lattice parameter between 5.44 and 6.62  , appropriate for some typical ii - vi and iii - v semiconducting substrates . </S>",
    "<S> electronic structure is calculated via the linear muffin - tin - orbitals ( lmto ) method in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) , using empty spheres to optimize asa - related errors . whenever necessary </S>",
    "<S> , the results have been verified using the full - potential version of the method , fp - lmto . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder effect in the as - sublattice for cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = sb , s , se , te ) alloys is taken into account via the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> exchange interactions are calculated using the linear response method for the ferromagnetic ( fm ) reference states of the alloys , as well as the disordered local moments ( dlm ) states . </S>",
    "<S> these results are then used to estimate the curie temperature from the low and high temperature side of the ferromagnetic / paramagnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the curie temperature are provided , based on the mean field and the more accurate random phase approximations . </S>",
    "<S> dominant antiferromagnetic exchange interactions for some low values of the lattice parameter for the fm reference states in crs , crse and crte prompted us to look for antiferromagnetic ( afm ) configurations for these systems with energies lower than the corresponding fm and dlm values . </S>",
    "<S> results for a limited number of such afm calculations are discussed , identifying the afm[111 ] state as a likely candidate for the ground state for these cases . </S>"
