    "since its launch on october 17 , 2002 , the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( _ integral _ ) has discovered hundreds of new hard x - ray sources . according to the most recent census , of the @xmath0500 sources detected in hard x - rays at energies greater than 20 kev , 214 had not been well - studied ( or even detected in most cases ) before @xcite .",
    "these new sources are called `` igr '' sources , for _ integral _ gamma - ray sources . of these igr sources ,",
    "50 had been identified as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , 32 as high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , 6 as low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and 15 as sources such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , supernova remnants , and anomalous x - ray pulsars , leaving 111 unclassified . since this last census",
    ", much work has been done to identify the @xmath050% of unclassified igr sources ( corresponding to @xmath025% of all sources detected by _ integral _ ) .",
    "many have been identified as agn , lmxbs and hmxbs , as well as relatively rare systems such as heavily absorbed ( i.e. ,  obscured \" ) supergiant hmxbs , supergiant fast x - ray transients , and intermediate polar ( ip ) cvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    _ integral _ is particularly well suited for finding such systems .",
    "part of _ integral _ s core program involved scans of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "one expects to find hmxbs here , as they consist of a neutron star or black hole accreting from a short - lived massive star , which would not be expected to move far from its birthplace in star forming regions of the galactic plane .",
    "other instruments observing at lower energies could not easily find these because of the obscuring dust and gas in the plane .",
    "furthermore , objects such as obscured hmxbs , which consist of a compact object embedded in the stellar wind of a supergiant star , suffer obscuration not only from the intervening medium , but also from local absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , _ integral _ has found disproportionately many ip cvs according to the previously known population statistics , since they emit at these high energies more than non - magnetic cvs or polar cvs @xcite .",
    "currently , less than 10% of known cvs are magnetic .",
    "the majority of these are polars , so called since they show polarization of optical flux .",
    "these are systems in which the white dwarf has a magnetic field strong enough to synchronize the orbital period of the binary with the spin of the white dwarf .",
    "intermediate polars have a weaker magnetic field that is not strong enough to cause synchronization , but they do display variability associated with the rotation of the white dwarf . of the at least 15 cvs detected by _",
    "integral _ , the vast majority are these relatively rare magnetic systems , with most of those being ips .",
    "identification of these unclassified sources requires observations of the source in the optical and/or infrared .",
    "the ibis imager on _ integral _ is unique among hard x - ray / soft @xmath6-ray detectors in that it is able to locate point sources with an accuracy on the order of arcminutes @xcite . to identify a unique optical or infrared counterpart ,",
    "however , the error circle must be reduced to the level of ( sub-)arcseconds . thus , from the _ integral _ position , soft x - ray telescopes , such as the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _ observe the region .",
    "this typically allows identification of the optical counterpart , which can then be studied to yield an identification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "igr j16426 + 6536 has one _ xmm - newton _ slew source at @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xcite and two _ rosat _ sources within the _ integral _ error circle .",
    "there is one usno - b1.0 source within one of the _ rosat _ error circles and none in the other .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ source has two usno - b1.0 sources within its @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) error circle .",
    "we observed the brighter of the two sources ( usno - b1.0 15550172189 ) in the _ xmm - newton _ error circle .",
    "this spectrum has redshifted emission lines , including broad balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines ( figure  [ fig : spectra]a ) , indicating that this source is a seyfert 1 agn .",
    "this is congruous with its position out of the galactic plane , with galactic coordinates @xmath11 . to further classify the source",
    ", we use the scheme described in winkler ( 1992 ) , namely , the ratio of the flux in @xmath12 to that in [ oiii]@xmath13 , where these are the laboratory wavelengths .",
    "after dereddening the spectral lines using the galactic absorption from @xcite along with the extinction law from @xcite , we find @xmath14 , which makes this a seyfert 1.5 galaxy . calculating the redshift from both @xmath15 and [ oiii]@xmath13 and averaging , we find @xmath16 . though we did not observe all possible sources within the _ integral _ error circle , the identification of the one we did observe as an agn allows us to conclude that this is very likely the counterpart of the _ integral _ source .",
    "we note that @xcite came to similar conclusions from their spectroscopic analysis .",
    "although we identify it as a seyfert 1.5 , while they find that it is a seyfert 1 , there were several months between the observations , and this level of variability is not unheard - of ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    with a redshift of @xmath1 ,",
    "this source is at a luminosity distance of @xmath17 , using @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole using the relations described in @xcite and @xcite . to use the relations , we recalculate the luminosity distance with the cosmological parameters used in those papers , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "this gives @xmath24 , from which we find the luminosity in @xmath25 ( dereddened as described above ) , @xmath26 .",
    "combining this with the rest - frame fwhm velocity of the broad line region ( from @xmath25 ) , @xmath27 , gives a black hole mass of @xmath28 .",
    "igr j182141318 was observed by _",
    "chandra _ , which found one source at @xmath29 , @xmath30 , coinciding with usno - b1.0 07660475700 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum yields a column density of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . with a galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath33 ,",
    "this implies a local absorption of @xmath34 , which was suggested to be from the wind of a high - mass star @xcite .",
    "this source was also observed by _ swift _ , which found a position and photon index consistent with that obtained by _",
    "chandra _ , but a lower hydrogen column density of @xmath35 , indicating that @xmath36 is variable in this source @xcite .",
    "we find that the optical spectrum has a very reddened continuum ( figure  [ fig : spectra]b ) . from this",
    ", we infer that the source is relatively distant , since significant reddening would be expected for a distant source in the galactic plane ( @xmath37 ) . convolving the spectrum with the filters from @xcite , we find @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where the errors are from the 15% systematic uncertainty in flux .",
    "we note that the i band magnitude from the photometric observation made at tug , @xmath41 , agrees within the errors .",
    "we first consider the possibility that the source is a cv .",
    "combining the apparent magnitudes with typical absolute magnitudes for cvs ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite ) and a range of extinctions from @xmath44 results in distances that range from @xmath45 .",
    "this distance range is far too close to account for the observed amount of extinction ( assuming the optical extinction is interstellar ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum lacks emission lines , while a cv would be expected to have strong emission lines .",
    "these arguments allow us to rule out the possibility that the source is a cv . applying the same procedure to check for the possibility of an lmxb , we combined the apparent magnitude , the typical absolute magnitude for an lmxb ( @xmath46 and @xmath43 @xcite ) , and the same range of extinctions .",
    "in this case , the distances range from @xmath47 , which are not inconsistent with the amount of extinction , but the source has a hard x - ray spectrum which would be very unusual for an lmxb @xcite .    .",
    "all are normalized to have the same k magnitude .",
    "the squares indicate the denis magnitudes , and the diamonds indicate the 2mass magnitudes of the optical counterpart of igr j182141318 . the spectrum taken at kitt peak",
    "is plotted with dotted lines overlayed to indicate the upper and lower bounds due to the 15% uncertainty in flux calibration . ]",
    "these considerations allow us to conclude that it must be either an hmxb or a symbiotic star system . in figure",
    "[ fig : hmxbcolors ] , spectral shapes typical of both are interpolated from the colors in @xcite and plotted with extinctions of @xmath48 , using the extinction relations from @xcite . the infrared magnitudes from denis and 2mass ( reported in tomsick et al .",
    "2008a ) along with the optical spectrum for the source are overlayed .",
    "these show that the data are consistent with a b0v star or an o9i star with extinction of @xmath49 .",
    "the model k2iii star spectra provide a worse fit to the data .",
    "the j - band magnitude requires an extinction of @xmath50 , while the optical data are consistent with @xmath51 .",
    "further evidence supporting an hmxb is shown in figure  [ fig : zoom18214 ] , which is a close up of the near - infrared region of the spectrum .",
    "several paschen absorption lines and one neutral helium line are observed ( although p14 is not observed ) .",
    "these lines are indicative of an o or b star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a check , we indicate the positions of the ca ii triplet with the dot - dashed lines , and confirm that the absorption is more consistent with paschen lines .",
    "in addition , other paschen lines ( p12 , p11 , p10 , p9 ) are clearly detected .",
    "we also note that the upper limit on the equivalent width of @xmath52 is consistent with @xmath52 equivalent widths of ob stars @xcite .",
    "thus , we firmly identify the optical source as a high mass star .    the galactic hydrogen column density combined with the relationship between visual extinction and hydrogen column density detailed in @xcite ( @xmath53 + 0.23 $ ] )",
    "gives a visual extinction of @xmath54 , which is consistent with the extinction inferred from colors for stars of type b0v and o9i .",
    "considering a range of spectral types and using absolute magnitudes from @xcite with @xmath54 , we find distances that range from @xmath55 for b0v to o5v stars and @xmath56 for a0i to o9i stars , giving an overall distance range of @xmath57 .",
    "however , using the general relation of @xmath58 @xcite , the lower limit of visual extinction ( @xmath59 ) implies a distance of at least 6 kpc , suggesting that the most likely distance range is @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , the observed variation in hydrogen column density argues in favor of a supergiant ( and , therefore , a distance near the upper end of the range ) , since hmxbs with supergiant companions are known to show variations in column density @xcite .",
    "igr j183081232 was observed by _",
    "chandra _ , which found one source at @xmath61 , @xmath62 , coinciding with usno - b1.0 07740551687 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum gives a hydrogen column density of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where the errors are at the 90% confidence level ( tomsick et al . in prep . ) .",
    "note that this source is referred to as igr j183071232 in @xcite , where they report an _ xmm - newton _ slew - survey counterpart at @xmath65 , @xmath66 with a @xmath10 uncertainty of @xmath9 , consistent with the _ chandra _ position .",
    "the optical spectrum shows balmer , paschen , and hei lines in emission ( figure  [ fig : spectra]c ) , all consistent with @xmath67 .",
    "these lines are typical of both cvs @xcite and lmxbs @xcite , but the hard x - ray spectrum is typical for a cv , and , as noted above , is not expected for an lmxb . using the hydrogen column density and the aforementioned relation between column density and visual extinction , we find @xmath68 . convolving the spectrum",
    "as described in the previous section gives @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "combining the magnitude and visual extinction with the typical values for cv absolute magnitudes listed above , we find @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite also identify this as a cv .",
    "they find a larger distance , although it agrees within the uncertainties , of @xmath73 as a result of using usno - a2.0 magnitudes ( which are fainter for this source ) and a different method of calculating extinction ( which resulted in lower extinction ) .",
    "igr j19267 + 1325 was observed by _",
    "chandra _ , which found one source at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , coinciding with usno - b1.0 1033044065 .",
    "although the source for igr j19267 + 1325 falls just outside of the @xmath76 confidence _ integral _ error circle , it was the only bright x - ray source _ chandra _ found in the area .",
    "fitting the x - ray spectrum gives @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum shows balmer , paschen , hei and heii emission lines at @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig : spectra]d ) .",
    "these lines , along with the hard x - ray spectrum , suggest a cv nature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the heii line and large equivalent width of @xmath25 ( @xmath79 ) suggest a magnetic cv @xcite . @xcite and @xcite also identify this source as a probable magnetic cv .",
    "the equivalent widths reported by @xcite match our findings ( @xmath80 ) , while @xcite find an equivalent width of @xmath52 equal to @xmath81 .",
    "based on two measurements from the int photometric h - alpha survey ( iphas ) , they find moderate short term variability in @xmath52 of  0.1 mag , which is not large enough to explain the difference in equivalent widths found , though there could be a larger maximum variability .",
    "based on the detection of a periodicity in _ swift - xrt _ data , @xcite confirm that it is a magnetic cv , identifying it as an intermediate polar cv . using the hydrogen column density and the relation between visual extinction and hydrogen column density mentioned previously ,",
    "we find @xmath82 .",
    "convolving the spectrum as described above , we find magnitudes of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "we combine the magnitude and visual extinction with the typical values of cvs above to find @xmath86 .",
    "this distance is lower than that found by @xcite , @xmath87 , for the same reasons as for igr j183081232 .",
    "igr j22292 + 6647 was observed by _ swift _ , which found a source at @xmath88 , @xmath89 , coinciding with usno - b1.0 15670242133 .",
    "there is a radio source at this location ( 87 gb 222741.2 + 663124 ) , described as an asymmetric double @xcite , which suggests this may be an agn @xcite .",
    "this is congruous with its position out of the galactic plane , with galactic coordinates @xmath90    the optical spectrum has a flat continuum dominated by one strong and broad emission line ( figure  [ fig : spectra]e ) .",
    "if we assume that the strong feature is @xmath52 , we find a redshift of @xmath91 .",
    "the broad hydrogen line indicates this is a seyfert 1 agn .",
    "we have firm identifications of five igr sources .",
    "igr j183081232 and igr j19267 + 1325 are cvs .",
    "they have distances on the order of a couple hundred parsecs , which is typical of other cvs detected by _ integral _",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the column densities from x - ray observations imply extinctions that are rather large given the distances we find .",
    "for example , igr j19267 + 1325 is found to have 1.4 magnitudes of extinction at a distance of 250 pc , while typical average extinction is @xmath92 @xcite",
    ". however , more reasonable distances and extinctions are feasible within the uncertainties .",
    "this could also mean that some of the x - ray absorption is intrinsic to the source .",
    "the identification of igr j19267 + 1325 as a magnetic cv is not surprising , and , in fact , igr j183081232 was also identified as a magnetic cv by @xcite . as a result of the hard x - rays emitted by magnetic systems , the majority of cvs detected by _",
    "integral _ have been magnetic @xcite even though such systems only comprise @xmath93 of the cv population as a whole .",
    "_ integral _ observations of cvs , therefore , unambiguously show that the magnetic field plays an important role in the hard x - ray emission of these systems .",
    "we conclude that igr j182141318 is an obscured hmxb .",
    "it has an extremely reddened continuum , indicating much absorption along the line of sight , which implies a fairly large distance .",
    "it has absorption lines that are typical of a high mass star , and the observed colors and flux are consistent with an extincted high mass main sequence or supergiant star ( and the variable hydrogen column density may argue for the latter ) .",
    "in addition , the x - ray spectrum shows significant local absorption , which could come from a wind from a high mass star",
    ". an infrared spectrum may be one way to further classify the companion star .",
    "the infrared suffers less extinction than the optical , and more features would be observable .",
    "a higher resolution spectrum would also be valuable in identifying the luminosity and exact spectral class .",
    "it is instructive to compare the x - ray luminosities for the above sources to typical hmxbs and cvs . in the _ chandra _ band ( 0.310 kev ) ,",
    "igr j182141318 has an unabsorbed 0.310 kev flux of @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "taking a distance of @xmath95 , this results in a luminosity of @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the average properties of neutron star hmxbs given in @xcite .",
    "while the hard x - ray spectrum and luminosity argue for a neutron star , detection of x - ray pulsations would be necessary to rule out a black hole .",
    "igr j183081232 has @xmath96 ( tomsick et al . in prep . ) , which implies a luminosity of @xmath4 with our calculated distance ( 220 pc ) .",
    "the _ integral _ flux from @xmath97 of @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite implies a luminosity of @xmath100 .",
    "we compare this luminosity to known intermediate polar cvs in @xcite over the energy range @xmath101 , assuming the flux from the range where we lack data is of the same order as that from the _ chandra _ range ( a reasonable assumption , given the spectral shapes in the above paper ) .",
    "our luminosity falls in the range of known ip cvs , although it is on the low end .",
    "igr j19267 + 1325 is a similar case . its flux in the _ chandra _",
    "band is @xmath102 @xcite , which implies a luminosity of @xmath5 with our calculated distance ( 250 pc ) .",
    "the _ integral _ flux of @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite implies a luminosity of @xmath105 .",
    "again , this results in a total luminosity on the low end of the range of known cv luminosities .",
    "these low values could be an indication that the distances lie at the high end of our error range .",
    "igr j16426 + 6536 and igr j22292 + 6647 are seyfert 1 agn , and igr j16426 + 6536 is further classified as a seyfert 1.5 agn .",
    "the 127 _ integral_-detected seyferts ( which have an average redshift @xmath106 ) and the 34 igr seyferts ( with average redshift @xmath107 ) are plotted in figure  [ fig : agnhist ] . with redshifts of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ,",
    "igr j16426 + 6536 and igr j22292 + 6647 are considerably more distant than average .",
    "in fact , igr j16426 + 6536 is an interesting case since it is the highest redshift igr seyfert , though there is one _ integral_-detected seyfert , pks 0637752 , with a higher redshift of @xmath108 .",
