    "many network phenomena are well modeled as spreads of epidemics through a network . however , depending on the motivation , different mechanisms are at work and we believe that different models should be used . for example , to model the spread of worms or email viruses , and , more generally , faults , a simple diffusion model is often used , where each node when it becomes infected or faulty transmits the infection to her neighbors independently and with a given probability .",
    "there is now a vast literature on such epidemics on complex networks ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "but if nodes represent agents in a social network , the transmission mechanism is independent of the local condition faced by the agents concerned . but to model the spread of innovations as a social process , individual s adoption behavior is highly correlated with the behavior of her contacts . in this case , there is a factor of persuasion or coordination involved and relative considerations tend to be important in understanding whether some new behavior or belief is adopted @xcite . in social contexts ,",
    "the spread of information and behavior often exhibits features that do not match well those of the diffusion model just described where an individual is influenced by each of her neighbors independently .",
    "in such a context , the linear threshold model , originally proposed by granovetter @xcite , captures in a simple way the local correlations among individuals .",
    "we will study the symmetric threshold model proposed by lelarge @xcite , which generalizes both bootstrap percolation @xcite and contagion model @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze two different types of epidemics modeled by simple growth processes that we now describe . in a given network",
    ", each node can either be active or inactive .",
    "the _ diffusion _",
    "process corresponds to the case where each node of the network that becomes active transmits the activation to her neighbors with a given probability , independently from each others . on the other hand , in the _ symmetric threshold _",
    "model , a threshold is associated to each node , and the dynamics of the process corresponds to the case where a node of the network becomes active as soon as the number of her active neighbors exceeds the threshold of the node . as in the original model of @xcite , thresholds are ( possibly ) random , with a distribution depending on the degree of the node , and such that thresholds are independent among nodes .",
    "the symmetric threshold model will allow us to analyze the contagion process @xcite .",
    "for both models , we will first consider a case where there is only one initial active node and characterize conditions under which global cascades are possible , that is to say when a positive fraction of the population is active at the end of the process . in such cases",
    "we compute the probability of a cascade and its size .",
    "then , we consider the cascade size when a positive fraction of the population is initially active .",
    "the initial activations are random in that case , and the probability that a node belongs to the seed might depend on its degree .",
    "we now describe the model of random graphs studied in this paper . for many real - world networks ,",
    "the underlying graph @xmath0 is a power - law graph , _",
    "i.e.  _ a graph whose degree distribution follows a power law .",
    "random graphs with a given degree sequence allow to model such behavior .",
    "this model is usually called the configuration model @xcite .",
    "there is a vast literature on the analysis of the diffusion for such graphs @xcite .",
    "the contagion process has also been studied for such graphs through heuristics @xcite or rigorously in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "random graphs are not considered to be highly realistic models of most real - world networks , and they are used as first approximation as they are a natural choice for sparse interaction network in the absence of any known geometry",
    ". one essential drawback of this model is that these graphs are locally tree - like : short cycles are very rare .",
    "however , real - world networks are often highly clustered , meaning that there is a large number of triangles and other short cycles @xcite . for social graphs ,",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that friendship circles are typically strongly overlapping so that many of our friends are also friends of each other .",
    "there are works in the physics and biology literature on models of random graphs with clustering @xcite .",
    "our model is inspired from @xcite which allow to model random graphs with positive clustering and possibly power law degree distribution .",
    "the idea is to add clustering to a standard configuration model by replacing some vertices by cliques . by choosing the fraction of vertices replaced ,",
    "this leads to a graph where the amount of clustering can be tuned by adjusting the parameters of the model .",
    "this model generalizes the standard configuration model to incorporate clustering .",
    "understanding how clustering affects diffusion and contagion remains largely an open question .",
    "our work is a first step towards addressing this issue in a systematic and rigorous way . in particular , we are able to make a rigorous analysis of the impact of a variation of the clustering coefficient while keeping the degree distribution in the graph fixed . to the best of our knowledge , this sensitivity analysis is new and gives a number of insights on the impact of clustering . in @xcite and @xcite , the diffusion process on such graphs",
    "is analyzed by an heuristic approximation through a branching process with additional cliques .",
    "we derive rigorous proofs for these results .",
    "a different model of random graphs with clustering , called random intersection graphs has been studied rigorously in @xcite and in @xcite , the diffusion process is studied on such graphs .",
    "however , the degree distribution for this kind of graphs has to be a poisson distribution and clustering can not vary independently of the degree distribution .",
    "up to our knowledge , results on the contagion model have not been proved before our work for random graphs with clustering .",
    "recently , @xcite derives bounds which are valid for the contagion model @xcite on deterministic networks .",
    "our analysis in contrast gives asymptotic results as the size of the graph tends to infinity and allows us ( by looking at a more specific model ) to identify neatly the impact of clustering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : rg ] , we present the graph model , compute its asymptotic degree distribution and its asymptotic clustering coefficient .",
    "we explain how to tune the clustering coefficient of the model , while keeping the asymptotic degree distribution fixed . in section",
    "[ sec : diff ] , we derive the minimal value for the probability of infection in our random graph model with clustering such that a global diffusion is possible , and we compute the size of the diffusion in that case .",
    "we apply these results to random regular graphs and power - law graphs and show that clustering inhibits the diffusion process in that case .",
    "we also compute the cascade size for the diffusion process with degree based activation . in section [ sec : cont ] , we derive the cascade condition for the symmetric threshold model on our random graph model with clustering , together with the size of the cascade when it occurs .",
    "numerical evaluations in the particular case of the contagion process show that the effect of clustering on the contagion threshold depends on the mean degree of the graph , and that clustering decreases the cascade size when it occurs .",
    "in addition , we finally compute the cascade size for the symmetric threshold model with a slight variant of the degree based activation .",
    "proofs are given in section [ sec : pf ] .",
    "our main contributions are    * the study of a tractable random graph model with tunable clustering : our model is equivalent to the one in @xcite . in section [ sec : rg ] , we introduce it and compute the asymptotic degree distribution of the graph and the clustering coefficient , * the analysis of a diffusion process with given probability of infection . in section [ sec : diff ] , we derive the minimal value for the probability of infection in our random graph model with clustering such that a global diffusion is possible .",
    "this proves a heuristical result of @xcite , and * the analysis of a contagion process with threshold effect . in section [ sec : cont ] , we derive the contagion threshold for our random graph model with clustering extending recent results of @xcite .    to our knowledge ,",
    "our work is the first rigorous investigation of how the spread of an epidemic with threshold effect is affected by clustering and we show that as clustering increases the contagion threshold decrease , making it easier for diffusions to spread .",
