    "intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmf ) , particularly those inside intergalactic void regions , have attracted much interest as possible remnants of primordial magnetic fields that were generated in the early universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while such fields can be amplified later within galaxies and galaxy clusters by dynamo processes , they may remain unaffected by subsequent astrophysical effects deep inside voids .",
    "thus , igmfs are expected to be a window onto the early universe . for comprehensive reviews on primordial and intergalactic magnetic fields ,",
    "see widrow ( 2002 ) , widrow et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and ryu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    however , the predicted amplitudes for igmfs of primordial origin are generally very small , @xmath6 , and difficult to probe through faraday rotation measurements in distant radio sources or their effects on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . in this context , a method that is sensitive to weak igmfs utilizing delayed secondary emission from high - energy gamma - ray sources was proposed by plaga ( 1995 ) and subsequently developed by many authors @xcite",
    ". such emission that we refer to as `` pair echos '' is expected to occur typically at gev energies , for which the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) is currently the most sensitive instrument .",
    "since the echo flux is predicted to be larger for smaller @xmath0 , a gev upper limit on such components translates into a lower bound on @xmath0 .    in our previous study @xcite",
    ", we focused on a specific tev flare of mrk 501 observed in 2009 by the veritas ( very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ) and magic ( major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ) telescopes . comparing the expected light curves of the pair echo from the flare and the concurrent quiescent emission with simultaneous _ fermi _ observations",
    ", we obtained a lower bound on the igmf amplitude of @xmath7 at @xmath8 confidence level assuming a field coherence length of 1 kpc .",
    "this was obtained with minimal assumptions about the primary tev emission during unobserved periods or spectral bands , and can be considered more robust in comparison with previous studies @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the tev blazar mrk 421 located at @xmath9 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk421 ] , maps of the local galaxy distribution from the sloan digital sky survey reveal that a large void lies between our galaxy and the supercluster containing mrk 421 @xcite .",
    "this is also seen to be the case for mrk 501 .",
    "thus , mrk 421 is a desirable target for probing igmfs .",
    "mrk 421 has been monitored continuously at tev energies by the argo - ybj experiment over the period from 2007 november to 2010 february @xcite ( hereafter b11 ) , during which many flares were observed so that more statistically significant bounds on igmfs can be expected .",
    "note that compared with cherenkov telescopes , such air shower detectors have a much higher duty cycle and allow uninterrupted long - term observations , albeit at lower sensitivity .",
    "first we discuss the tev spectrum and light curve of mrk 421 with which we evaluate the pair echo . in b11 ,",
    "the daily fluxes at energies above @xmath10 are presented for approximately 850 days .",
    "for some days , negative numbers are reported that are presumably caused by systematic errors , and we simply set them to zero .",
    "although the spectra are not available separately for each day , average spectra were derived for four different flux states based on the x - ray count rate .",
    "since the tev flux was shown to be tightly correlated with that in x - rays , here we choose to define three flux states according to the daily tev counts ,  high \" ( count @xmath11 ) ,  medium \" ( @xmath12 count @xmath13 ) and  low \" ( count @xmath14 ) , which correspond respectively to the x - ray flux levels 4 , 3 and 1 + 2 of b11 .",
    "note that levels 1 and 2 can be treated together for our purposes as their tev spectra are very similar . according to the daily flux , we assume that the tev spectral index for each day takes the average value of the corresponding flux state .",
    "we also impose a maximum spectral cutoff at 5 tev as the highest energy photons detected by argo - ybj , as well as a minimum cutoff at 0.1 tev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , exemplary spectra for the three states are shown , with and without the effects of intergalactic @xmath2 absorption using the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) model of franceschini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , also adopted in b11 .",
    "it turns out that the resulting constraints on the igmf is largely determined by the high state emission , and the low state is of very little relevance .    for gev gamma - rays ,",
    "we utilize the data from _ fermi _ lat that has been performing continuous observations of mrk 421 in the survey mode from mjd 54683 .",
    "we obtained the data through the _ fermi _ science support center ( fssc ) and adopt the standard analysis tools provided by the fssc . in our analysis , we divide the energy band in three , that is , 100 mev-1 gev , 1 - 10 gev , and @xmath1510 gev , and derive flux probability distribution functions for each day assuming poisson statistics . because the statistics is small for this short interval ( 1-day bins ) , we adopt the aperture photometry method where we count events located within 1 degree from the source . note that we can neglect the background events above 1 gev for this timescale at the high galactic latitude of mrk 421 .",
    "below we use data during mjd 54683 - 55255 , when both tev and gev observations were performed , focusing on the energy range of @xmath16 where _ fermi _ lat is most sensitive and the strongest constraints on the pair echo can be obtained .",
    "we summarize briefly the basic physics of pair echos ( for details , see e.g. ichiki et al .",
    "2008 and takahashi et al .",
    "the mean free path of primary gamma - rays with energy @xmath17 for @xmath2 interactions with the cib is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the thomson cross section and @xmath20 is the number density of relevant cib photons .",
    "the interaction results in an @xmath1 pair with energy @xmath21 , which can then inverse - compton ( ic ) upscatter ambient cmb photons to produce the pair echo , that is , secondary gamma rays with energy @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cmb temperature and @xmath24 . for primary gamma rays with @xmath25 , @xmath26 . as long as plasma instabilities are unimportant ( see below ) ,",
    "the pairs continue successive ic scattering until they lose a large fraction of their energy over a length scale @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cmb energy density . comparing typical values for @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we see that the pairs are generated mostly far away from the source , and then cool over a much smaller scale .",
    "thus , for mrk 421 , the pairs are likely to be produced deep inside and propagate only within the large , intervening void ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk421 ] ) .",
    "it has been suggested recently that rather than ic cooling , the beam of the @xmath2-produced pairs may lose much of their energy by heating the intergalactic gas through two - stream - like plasma instabilities @xcite .",
    "if true , it may considerably reduce the pair echo signal , while causing some non - trivial consequences for the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "however , the actual efficiency and eventual fate of such instabilities has been debated @xcite and is highly uncertain at the moment .",
    "below , we proceed on the assumption that such instabilities are insignificant .    a crucial attribute of the pair echo is the time delay compared with the primary gamma - rays , caused by two effects .",
    "one is the angular spreading inherent in the pair production and ic scattering processes , for which the typical delay time @xmath31 ( ichiki et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the second is deflections of the pairs in the igmf with typical delay time @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ] is the typical deflection angle , @xmath34 the larmor radius and @xmath35 the coherence length of the igmf .",
    "if @xmath36 , that is , the igmf is sufficiently tangled on the ic cooling scale , @xmath37 where @xmath0 is the field amplitude .",
    "hereafter we take a fiducial value @xmath38 ( see e.g. langer et al .",
    "2005 ) , although the results can be trivially scaled for other values as it always occurs in the combination @xmath39 if @xmath40 .",
    "the total delay time is approximately @xmath41 , and the magnetic field properties are reflected in the delay as long as @xmath42 .    to calculate the pair echo spectra and light curves , we follow ichiki et al .",
    "first , the time - integrated flux of secondary pairs is @xmath43 , \\label{eq : dn0dgamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the primary gamma - ray fluence and @xmath45 is the @xmath2 optical depth in the cib .",
    "the time - dependent pair - echo spectrum is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ic spectrum from a single electron / positron , and @xmath48 is the total flux of pairs relevant for the echo gamma - rays observed at time @xmath49 .",
    "this formalism was extended to account for the finite probability of pair production near the observer in takahashi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ( see also dai et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "weaker igmfs generally lead to higher echo fluxes , as long as the time delay is dominated by @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 . for @xmath38 , @xmath50 is of the same order as @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "[ fig : lc_tev - pa2 ] compares the daily tev counts with the @xmath16 light curves of the pair echo during a period of 150 days for two values of @xmath0 . while the two are generally correlated , for weaker igmf , the peak flux of the echo is larger and its response to the primary emission is quicker .",
    "although the magnetic deflection implies that the pair echo emission should also be spatially extended around the primary source , the extension is much smaller than the _ fermi _ angular resolution and can be neglected for the field strengths of @xmath52 considered here .",
    "we now compare the expected pair echo with the _ fermi_-lat data and derive constraints on the igmf .",
    "compared with our previous paper @xcite , we have a much greater number of independent flux bins ( each representing the daily count ) , so a more sophisticated method of deriving the constraints is necessary .",
    "first , we compute the probability @xmath53 that a specific value of the the igmf amplitude is excluded by the @xmath54-th flux bin , using the probability distribution function of the true flux obtained from the _ fermi_-lat observation . then , we combine the probabilities to derive the total probability @xmath55 using meta - analysis .    note that it would not be appropriate to simply combine such probabilities for all bins .",
    "if the tev flux for the @xmath54-th bin is low enough for the expected echo flux to be below the _ fermi _ sensitivity for that bin , the probability @xmath53 would be small , irrespective of @xmath0 . if we combine all such probabilities , the total probability @xmath55 can become so small that no constraints on @xmath0 can be obtained , even if some values of @xmath53 are sufficiently large for bins during tev flares .",
    "thus , we must select data bins for which the expected echo flux would be detectable by _ fermi _ , depending on the assumed value of @xmath0 . as explained above , larger @xmath0 results in a weaker echo that can only be detected for bins with higher tev flux ,",
    "so the number of such bins will be smaller . here",
    "we set this selection threshold such that the echo flux exceeds the 2-@xmath3 sensitivity of _ fermi_-lat . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_sensitivity - ul ] , this is compared with the echo light curves for @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath16 during a particular 50-day period ( only a small fraction of the entire data set ) . here",
    "4 and 3 bins exceed the _",
    "fermi_-lat sensitivity for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , which correspond to large tev flares as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_tev - pa2 ] .",
    "[ fig : lc_sensitivity - ul ] also plots the @xmath58 confidence _",
    "fermi_-lat upper limits on the daily flux .",
    "for the first flare ( mjd 55147 ) , the expected pair - echo flux for @xmath56 greatly exceeds the upper limit , and the probability that this value of @xmath0 is excluded is very large .",
    "although that for @xmath59 also exceeds the limit , it does not reach the 2-@xmath3 sensitivity , so the bin is not counted to compute @xmath55 for this @xmath0 value . for the second ( mjd 55152 ) and third ( mjd 55166 ) flares ,",
    "the echo fluxes surpass the upper limits as well as the sensitivity for both @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for the fourth flare ( mjd 55182 ) ,",
    "the echo flux for @xmath56 is comparable to the @xmath58 confidence upper limit , neither favoring nor excluding this @xmath0 value , whereas that for @xmath59 is not constrained by the limit and this @xmath0 value remains allowed .",
    "we now consider the probability distribution function of the true flux and calculate the probability @xmath53 that it is less than the expected pair - echo flux for the @xmath54-th bin .",
    "to combine @xmath53 , we use the inverse normal method , a type of meta - analysis .",
    "first , we derive the z value of the normal distribution for the @xmath54-th bin , @xmath60 , which is the percentile ( point ) of the one - sided p value @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath60 is negative if @xmath61 .",
    "next , we compute the total z value @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of the selected bins . finally , we derive the one - sided p value @xmath55 of the normal distribution that corresponds to the above @xmath62 .",
    "we can interpret @xmath55 such that the assumed value of @xmath0 is excluded at a confidence level of @xmath55 .",
    "[ fig : constraint ] shows @xmath62 as a function of @xmath0 . for @xmath65 , the delay time of the pair echo",
    "is determined by angular spreading and becomes independent of @xmath0 .",
    "such weak igmfs including @xmath66 is excluded by about 4-@xmath3 significance .",
    "the significance decreases for larger @xmath0 , and no constraints are obtained for @xmath67 .",
    "this is a consequence of the lack of any time bins for which the pair - echo flux exceeds the 2-@xmath3 _ fermi_-lat sensitivity when @xmath68 .",
    "here we have not considered emission components other than the pair echo in the gev band . in reality , there is likely to be primary gev emission from the blazar , and possibly also other types of secondary gev emission ( e.g. essey et al .",
    "if such components can be reliably accounted for , stronger upper limits on the pair echo and hence stronger lower bounds on the igmf would be obtainable from the same _ fermi _ data .",
    "using data from long - term , simultaneous gev - tev observations of mrk 421 by _ fermi_-lat and argo - ybj , we have constrained the flux of secondary pair echos and derived lower bounds on the igmf strength in the large void region lying between our galaxy and mrk 421 .",
    "this was done by : 1 ) calculating the daily pair - echo flux from the tev data over 600 days , 2 ) selecting the dates where the expected pair - echo flux exceeds the _",
    "fermi_-lat 2-@xmath3 sensitivity , 3 ) computing the probability that an assumed value of the igmf is excluded by the _ fermi_-lat data for each date , and 4 ) combining these probabilities to derive the total probability using the inverse normal method .",
    "consequently , as long as plasma instabilities are inconsequential , igmfs weaker than @xmath69 are excluded by about 4-@xmath3 for a field coherence length of 1 kpc . for general values of @xmath35 ,",
    "the derived constraint is @xmath70~{\\rm g}$ ] , where the latter case corresponds to igmfs that are coherent over the ic cooling length .",
    "improving on our previous analysis using mrk 501 @xcite , no assumptions are made here concerning the tev emission during unobserved periods .",
    "the obtained constraints are thus more robust than from other studies , particularly those based on limits to the spatially - extended halo emission from secondary pairs that inevitably involves very long time delays , often longer than the typical lifetimes of blazars .",
    "although the value of the lower limit obtained here is similar to our previous work , the statistical significance has increased remarkably , from less than 2-@xmath3 to about 4-@xmath3 , thanks to the much larger data and improved statistical analysis .    in our study , the errors in the tev flux , which propagate to the errors in the expected pair - echo flux , have not been considered . however , assuming a gaussian distribution for the errors , the probability that the true echo flux is larger ( or smaller ) than the central value is @xmath58 , so the errors in the expected echo flux should cancel out among the data bins to some extent and is unlikely to affect the total @xmath71 value significantly .",
    "here we have used the _",
    "fermi_-lat data only as daily upper limits to the gev fluxes .",
    "because the pair - echo flux is strongly dependent on the tev flux , we can obtain potentially tighter constraints on the igmf by investigating statistical correlations between the _",
    "fermi_-lat data and the argo - ybj data . this will be presented elsewhere in the near future .",
