    "<S> whether in the thermodynamic limit , vanishing magnetic field @xmath0 , and nonzero temperature the spin stiffness of the spin-@xmath1 @xmath2 heisenberg chain is finite or vanishes within the grand - canonical ensemble remains an unsolved and controversial issue , as different approaches yield contradictory results . </S>",
    "<S> here we provide an upper bound on the stiffness and show that within that ensemble it vanishes for @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit of chain length @xmath3 , at high temperatures @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our approach uses a representation in terms of the @xmath5 physical spins @xmath1 . for all configurations that generate the exact spin-@xmath6 energy and momentum eigenstates such a configuration involves a number @xmath7 of unpaired spins @xmath1 in multiplet configurations and @xmath8 spins @xmath1 that are paired within @xmath9 spin - singlet pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the bethe - ansatz strings of length @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe a single unbound spin - singlet pair and a configuration within which @xmath12 pairs are bound , respectively . in the case of @xmath11 pairs </S>",
    "<S> this holds both for ideal and deformed strings associated with @xmath12 complex rapidities with the same real part . </S>",
    "<S> the use of such a spin @xmath1 representation provides useful physical information on the problem under investigation in contrast to often less controllable numerical studies . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide strong evidence for the absence of ballistic transport in the spin-@xmath1 @xmath2 heisenberg chain in the thermodynamic limit , for high temperatures @xmath13 , vanishing magnetic field @xmath0 and within the grand - canonical ensemble . </S>"
