    "while size exclusion is reasonably straightforward , chemical selectivity is harder to achieve .",
    "this is exemplified in nanopore - based dna sequencing .",
    "recent technological advances have improved sensing resolution down to the single nucleotide level,@xcite but significant challenges remain .",
    "in particular , high fidelity and chemically selective sensing depend on an accurate control of the speed with which macromolecules translocate through the nanopore.@xcite interactions between the dna and the nanopore surface can lead to significant variation in translocation times,@xcite though well defined distributions have been recorded for shorter dna fragments.@xcite    while there is scope for improvement using natural ion channels @xcite or by inserting natural protein pores in artificial nanopore devices , @xcite a more generic method of nanopore functionalization is through the coating of its surface with specific macromolecules .",
    "for example , better control of single - molecular transport may be obtained by functionalization of the pores with one - end grafted polymers . @xcite",
    "solid - state nanopores grafted with polymers are also suggested as a possible flow control mechanism in microfluidic systems , responding to stimuli such as temperature or ph.@xcite    a fascinating example of a polymer - coated nanopore can be found in the living cell , where the nuclear pore complex ( npc ) is responsible for all macromolecular transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm.@xcite the walls of the npc are lined with natively unfolded proteins , which are intrinsically disordered and rich in the phenylalanine - glycine ( fg ) repeat amino - acid sequence .",
    "macromolecular transport is mediated by untethered globular macromolecules known as nuclear transport receptors via a mechanism that is still disputed , though clearly dependent on the affinity of these receptors to the fg - repeats .",
    "npc transport properties have also been mimicked in artificial devices by coating solid - state nanopores with selected proteins from the npc central channel.@xcite    besides their technological and biological importance , polymer - grafted pores are also of great fundamental interest . in the confinement of a cylindrical nanopore , polymer / polymer interactions have been shown , via numerical simulations,@xcite to yield a wide and rich pattern of possible morphologies .",
    "the understanding of the possible conformations of polymers within such geometries would be an important advance in the theory of polymer - coated pores and could guide experimental intuition .",
    "in particular , whilst work has been done to address the conformations of polymers within nanopores , they almost all use the simplifying assumption that the density of the polymers is rotationally symmetric around the central axis of the nanopore . in this paper",
    ", we address the nature of the polymer conformations if this restriction is lifted .    in general , tethered polymer systems",
    "have differing phase behavior depending on the intermolecular interactions .",
    "these phases are categorized by the scaling behavior of the radius of the gyration of the polymers@xcite , and labeled as  mushrooms \" or  brushes \" . when the polymers are tethered to the inside of a curved surface , such as the circumference of a nanopore",
    ", these behaviors are complemented further by two gross phases that differ from the simple swelling and collapsing of a polymer brush .",
    "they can broadly be categorized as  wall phases \" where the majority of the polymer density is found closer to their tethering points , and a  central phase \" where the polymers stretch away , at an entropic cost , from their tethering points and meet in the central channel of the nanopore@xcite .",
    "such behavior could provide a gating mechanism for macromolecular transport through nanopores , which might be exploited in artificial pores , and explain@xcite the remarkable abilities of the npc to selectively transport cargos as large as viruses.@xcite    the primary driver of this change in conformation is the minimization of the surface area of the polymer condensate .",
    "however , the wall phase can further reduce its surface area by condensing in separate clumps along the circumference of the pore , such that the average position of the polymers is still close to the wall , but they form into separate regions of large polymer density arranged around the nanopore circumference .",
    "such clumping will have an impact upon the phase diagram of polymer conformations by lowering the free energy of the wall phase .    in order to understand this better ,",
    "we determine how rotational symmetry breaking affects the stability of the previously observed central phase@xcite .",
    "we do this using several methods : monte carlo simulations , density functional theory calculations and a simple analytical treatment .",
    "our study builds upon on a previous paper @xcite where we observed rotational symmetry breaking in monte carlo simulations of a polymer - coated cylinder . for simplicity and computational tractability",
    "we restrict our analysis to two dimensional systems , i.e. , here we consider only variations as a function of radial and azimuthal coordinates .",
    "the model system is as follows : a number @xmath0 of polymers consisting of @xmath1 identical disks tethered around the circumference of a circle of radius @xmath2 , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]a .",
    "the disks are separated from each other by a bond length @xmath3 , and the polymers interact with each other through the following potential : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the diameter of the disk , @xmath6 is the vector connecting the centers of both beads , @xmath7 is the potential depth and @xmath8 represents the range of the interaction .     polymers of @xmath1 disks tethered on the inner surface of a circle , illustrated here for the case @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "b ) basis of the analytical model used to interpret the results .",
    "we divide the pore into @xmath11 sections , in each of the tethered polymers stretch to form a clump in the centre of the section , as indicated by the green arrows . in this case @xmath12 .",
    "the change in total free energy is given by the entropic cost of extending the polymers together with the total energy of the polymer phase which depends on the change in the length of the interface it forms with the surrounding medium . ]",
    "the system was studied using monte carlo , density functional theory and analytical calculations .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were performed using the metropolis algorithm@xcite on systems of tethered polymers and the density functional theory is adapted from our previous work@xcite .",
    "the analytical work is based on simple representations of polymer behavior .",
    "monte carlo simulations of 2d polymers with a fixed bond length constraint have difficulties with convergence .",
    "if we consider three consecutive disks along a polymer there are only two positions that the central disk of the three can take that preserve the fixed bond length constraint . because there is only one possible move per disk for any conformation that keeps the bond length constant , monte carlo performed in this way is slow to converge .",
    "the disk at the end of the polymer is the only one which has a continuous range of possible moves .",
    "moves that rotate a greater number of disks around a fixed disk could be considered , but the difficulty of avoiding disk overlap limits the likelihood that updates which move a large number of disks would be accepted . therefore the monte carlo results presented here should be viewed more as indicative of the equilibrium structure rather than exact quantitative representations of it .",
    "a more robust but necessarily simplified density functional theory of the system was also used to obtain the equilibrium densities of the polymers .",
    "this involves constructing a free energy functional of the polymer density and finding the structure that minimizes it .",
    "we adapt the functional used previously@xcite to the here studied 2d system ; more details can be found in appendix a.    by considering the change in entropy of the polymers as they stretch away from their tethering points together with the the total energy of each clump , we can write down a simple form for the change in free energy upon breaking the the rotational symmetry of the wall phase .",
    "the total entropy change of the system will be represented as a sum of terms quadratic in the distance between each polymer tether point and the center of its clump .",
    "we can evaluate the energy of each clump by integrating the potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppotential ] ) over the total area of the clump .",
    "this allows us to write the form of the change in free energy against clump number : @xmath13 where @xmath11 is the number of clumps , @xmath14 is the radial distance the polymers stretch away from the inner surface of the pore , which is related to the radius of a single clump @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]b ) .",
    "the only free parameter in this simple analytical model is the polymer disk density @xmath16 , and since this parameter varies when we modify @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we take this parameter from the theoretical results obtained in density functional theory . next",
    ", the clump number in equilibrium is deteremined by minimizing @xmath17 versus @xmath11 .",

    "the calculations were performed with the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 nm , @xmath21 nm and @xmath22 nm . the behavior of the system was established for a range of the interaction parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "monte carlo simulations can illustrate the propensity of the system to display rotationally asymmetric behavior .",
    "[ fig : mc1 ] gives an example of the clumping behavior of polymers in a pore.@xcite     nm ( b)@xmath23 , motivating more quantitative methods for determining the clump phase . ]",

    "potentially limit the reliability of this approach . for a more accurate investigation",
    ", we adapt our previously published density functional theory@xcite to describe two - dimensional polymers within a circular pore",
    ". density functional theory can typically provide results with less computational effort than monte carlo .",
    "in addition , free energies can be obtained directly .",

    "the effect of rotational symmetry breaking on the phase of the system can be determined .     and @xmath24 nm ( a and b respectively ) and for @xmath25 and @xmath26 nm ( c and d respectively ) .",
    "both methods yield similar results . ]",
    "we verify density functional theory results for the predicted clump number by monte carlo simulations for the same parameters .    because of the problems in the convergence of monte carlo , precise quantitative agreement between density functional theory and monte carlo is hard to achieve .",
    "nevertheless , there is a qualitative similarity in the obtained results from the two different methods , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dftmc ] .",
    "[ fig : den ] shows an example of the various phases obtained from the density functional theory approach .",
    "it is observed that there is a multiplicity of wall states , with different numbers of clumps . there",
    "exist many metastable states for each parameter set , necessitating the calculations to be repeated many times to determine the phase with the lowest free energy .",
    "the central and the wall phase can both exist at the same parameter set .",
    "the wall phase can consist of any number of clumps up to the number of polymers in the system . despite the differing numbers of clumps",
    ", it appears that the position of the clumps reflect maximal symmetry , in the sense that when there are six clumps they appear to be positioned on the vertices of a hexagon ; when there are five clumps they lie on the vertices of a pentagon and so forth .",
    "additionally , all the clumps are similar in terms of disk density and spatial extent .    according to the analytical model described in appendix b , the total entropy cost is , very approximately , inversely proportional to the clump number .",
    "therefore , large numbers of clumps carry little entropic cost of formation compared to a single central clump . again",
    "approximately , the total energy cost increases logarithmically with clump number ( up to an asymptote ) . the clumping number is determined by the delicate balance between these energetic and entropic contributions to the free energy .    using the density functional theory method we can test whether the rotational symmetry assumption has a large impact on the threshold interaction parameters at which the system has to choose between central and wall states .",
    "we can then investigate how well the simple analytical model can describe what is occuring in the phase transition .",
    "[ fig : phasemap ] shows the phase diagram of the polymers in terms of central / wall phases for the cases with the rotational symmetry assumption ( a ) and without it ( b ) .",
    "we can see clearly that relaxing this assumption leads to a wall phase that persists over a larger range @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , the overall effect is not too large , indeed a shift of around @xmath27 nm in @xmath8 would lead to phase diagrams that are very similar .",
    "the analytical model ( c ) captures the behavior , despite its many simplifications .",
    "the success of the analytical model confirms that the clumping behavior results from a competition between the entropy of stretching the polymers against the energy penalty of creating a larger surface area . when there are large numbers of clumps , the polymers do not need to stretch very far , as the clump is likely to be close to the polymer tethering point , and therefore the entropic cost of forming more numerous clumps is lower .",
    "however , a larger number of clumps will have a greater surface area compared to fewer clumps , which will increase the energy penalty .",
    "this competition determines the equilibrium phase , and as we decrease the strength of the attraction the system will begin to favor states with more clumps .",
    "the analytical model gives a simple way of quantifying , for a particular set of parameters , how this behaviour emerges .",
    "we have shown that a system of polymers tethered around the circumference of a nanopore can break rotational symmetry , leading to the formation of clumps at the wall .",
    "the number of clumps can be predicted from the system parameters , such as the interaction strength and the radius of the pore .",
    "previous theoretical results showed that tethered polymers could adopt wall or central phases , and this phase description remains valid even if the rotational symmetry assumption is dropped .",
    "when the rotational symmetry assumption is relaxed , the wall phase divides into multiple clumps which leads to a slight lowering of the free energy of the wall phase compared to the symmetric case , shrinking the boundaries of central phase stability on the phase diagram .    this effect will be largely dependent on the parameters chosen .",
    "for instance , cylindrical pores of small radii with long polymers will likely always be completely clogged by polymer , regardless of rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "this is similar to what is to be expected in three dimensions , such that previous results obtained in three dimensions are not qualitatively altered .",
    "we have developed a simple analytic model of the system that compares favorably with density functional theory calculations . by considering only the simplest form contributions to the free energy",
    "might take , we derived an equation that gives the change in free energy as the number of clumps is varied .",
