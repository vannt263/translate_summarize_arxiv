    "hydrodynamic turbulence , despite its ubiquitous nature , is extremely complex to be studied analytically .",
    "the degree of complexity gets considerably enhanced when the system consists of a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) fluid . yet",
    "several theoretical ( analytical ) works have been carried out in the framework of both the abovesaid cases when one assumes the incompressibility ( density of the fluid is constant in space and time and the velocity field is a solenoidal vector ) of the fluid .",
    "it was kolmogorov @xcite who for the first time derived in 1941 an exact relation for the third - order moment of the velocity structure functions in incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence  the famous 4/5 law ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "later two important exact relations were derived respectively for the conduction of a passive scalar in a turbulent system @xcite and incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "note that exact relations can also be derived for quasi - geostrophic flows @xcite or dispersive mhd @xcite , whereas attempts are currently made to model axisymmetric turbulence @xcite .    in a recent letter @xcite we have derived , for the first time , an exact relation for compressible hydrodynamic turbulence with an isothermal analytic closure @xmath0 , where p , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the fluid pressure , density and sound speed ( for our case it is supposed to be constant ) defined at every point of the flow field . in the present article",
    "we generalize our previous work to the mhd case .",
    "of course , the taking into consideration of compressibility of an mhd fluid leads us to get closer to the reality taking place for example in the solar wind because ( i ) it is a plasma ( so contains charged species ) , ( ii ) ulysses data analysis has shown clear evidences of the effect of compressibility @xcite and ( iii ) voyager data analysis at several astronomical units ( au ) reveals the presence of both fluctuations and jumps with spectra steeper than kolmogorov @xcite .",
    "moreover turbulence inside the interstellar clouds , being highly compressible ( supersonic ) , also demands a theoretical background in order to be properly understood @xcite .",
    "a thorough theoretical work in compressible mhd turbulence is essential ( suggested in @xcite ) above all because it will help to analyse and understand the results of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) done for compressible turbulence @xcite .",
    "a number of numerical works have been carried out for the last two decades in the case of compressible hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "being initiated mainly around the years 1990 @xcite , the numerical simulations get considerably sophisticated in the last ten years . recently ,",
    "kritsuk et al .",
    "@xcite have studied three - dimensional ( 3d ) isothermal compressible hydrodynamic turbulence using piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) for upto @xmath3 grid points where the r.m.s .",
    "mach number is around @xmath4 .",
    "their study consists of the helmholtz decomposition of velocity and they obtain a velocity power spectrum around @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 respectively for total velocity , solenoidal and compressible velocity components ) using @xmath9 grid points whereas they have a @xmath10 spectrum for the density - weighted fluid velocity @xmath11 . another important numerical work has been accomplished by federrath et al .",
    "@xcite for an identical ( to the previous one ) system of turbulence using upto @xmath9 grid points by applying compressible or solenoidal forcing . for two different types of forcing ,",
    "they have obtained remarkably different power spectra ( which questions the universality ) corresponding to various quantities like the total velocity , its longitudinal and transverse components , @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath11 .",
    "total velocity gives a @xmath14 and a @xmath15 power spectra in the supersonic range for solenoidal and compressible forcings respectively which are close to the burgers spectrum ( in @xmath16 ) .",
    "the compensated spectra in the subsonic region can not be affirmed to date to be free from bottleneck effect and so it is hard to conclude anything for that part .",
    "however , a @xmath10 spectra is obtained for @xmath11 even in supersonic range using solenoidal forcing whereas a compressible forcing gives a @xmath17 spectrum . here too a plausible presence of bottleneck effect prevents us from inferring for subsonic region .",
    "recently , aluie et al .",
    "@xcite have provided empirical evidences of kinetic energy cascade ( which is not an invariant in compressible turbulence ) using subsonic and transonic simulations . such cascading takes place far in the inertial zone due to very fast decay of the pressure - dilatation term which dominates at large scales .",
    "they do not give , however , any intuition for supersonic turbulence for which _ a priori _ the kinetic energy cascade may not be the dominant process . in the meantime",
    ", a theoretical work based on coarse - graining @xcite shows that for the kinetic energy a range of scales independent of the dissipation and the forcing may exist in compressible turbulence .",
    "3d dns of compressible mhd turbulence is more difficult to perform since it requires the computation of a heavier system in which several new regimes are possible . in this framework ,",
    "for example cho and lazarian @xcite implemented a third - order accurate hybrid and essentially non oscillatory numerical scheme to solve the isothermal , ideal mhd equations in a periodic box and for obtaining scaling relations they drove turbulence with a solenoidal forcing in fourier space using @xmath18 grid points . in their study , they executed a mode separation method in order to study the individual scaling behaviour of each of the present linear modes in a compressible mhd system alfvn mode , slow and fast magnetosonic ( ms ) modes .",
    "they reported a @xmath10 velocity fluctuation spectrum for each of the alfvn and slow ms modes whereas a @xmath19 spectrum for fast ms mode .",
    "the nature of spectra obtained is found to depend very weakly on the value of the plasma @xmath20 parameter ( the ratio of kinetic pressure to magnetic pressure ) .",
    "an approximately @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the length scale ) scaling is also obtained for the second - order structure function . in @xcite a kolmogorov spectrum ( @xmath10 ) was reported for both the velocity ( @xmath23 ) and density - weighted velocity ( @xmath11 ) fluctuations for subsonic mhd turbulence whereas only the second quantity follows a @xmath10 spectrum for supersonic turbulence .",
    "a relevant work to our present paper is that of kritsuk et al .",
    "@xcite where the authors studied numerically supersonic turbulence in magnetized magnetic clouds .",
    "the work is realised with grid resolutions from @xmath18 upto @xmath9 using ppm , an isothermal closure and a solenoidal forcing to drive the fluid .",
    "interestingly , they have observed the scale invariance of the total ( kinetic @xmath24 compressible ) energy transfer rate in the inertial zone ; we shall use this concept later in this article for constructing the different spectra .",
    "the most interesting and important aspect of their article is to obtain numerically the linear scaling in the 4/3-law of incompressible mhd turbulence to the weakly magnetized supersonic turbulence ",
    "the former elssser variables @xmath25 being replaced by the density - weighted elssser variables @xmath26 .",
    "the present article will give , by the help of an exact relation for compressible isothermal mhd turbulence , a theoretical support for this generalization .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] introduces the compressible mhd equations and the correlation functions ; the derivation of the exact relation which is the main result of this paper is given in section [ sec3 ] ; section [ sec4 ] is devoted to a discussion about the main result where in particular we look at the effect of a uniform magnetic field ; finally a conclusion is drawn in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "for constituting an exact relation of compressible mhd turbulence of an isothermal plasma , we rewrite the basic equations ( except the continuity equation which is kept unchanged ) of ideal mhd in an unusual form @xcite as follows : _",
    "t + ( ) & = & 0 , [ e1 ] + _ t + & = & - 1 ( p + 1 2 ^2 ) + & & - ( ) + + , [ e2 ] + _ t + & = & - 2 ( ) + _ m , [ e3 ] + & = & - 2 ( ) , [ e4 ] with @xmath27 the plasma density , @xmath28 the fluid velocity field , @xmath29 the alfvn velocity and @xmath30 the pressure .",
    "the terms @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent respectively the contribution of the kinetic viscosity , magnetic resistivity and the external forcing .",
    "it can be identified that equations ( [ e2 ] ) , ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) represent the force equation , the faraday s equation ( with idealised ohm s law injected ) and the zero divergence of magnetic field respectively . for the sake of simplicity in the present paper we use the isothermal closure ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath35 as it is defined in our case does not correspond to the usual alfvn velocity which does not depend on the density but just on the mean density .",
    "moreover , the alfvn mode is defined only when there is a mean external magnetic field @xmath36 whereas our @xmath35 is defined independently of the presence of @xmath36 .    as in the hydrodynamic case ,",
    "our analysis will be carried out in the physical space in terms of two - point correlation functions and structure functions , where the unprimed quantities represent the properties at the point @xmath37 and the primed quantities correspond to the point @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "our system is supposed to be statistically homogeneous and to undergo a completely developped turbulence .",
    "the analysis is general and contains no hypothesis of isotropy .    in order to establish an exact relation , we shall utilise the conservation of the total energy whose density is given as : e ( ) = 2 ( + ) + e , where @xmath40 accounts for the compressible energy term due to the isothermal closure and is expressed as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the initial equilibrium density .",
    "we however introduce another quantity which we call compressible cross - helicity density and is written as : h ( ) = .",
    "[ eheli ] although this quantity is not conserved in compressible mhd , we need it ( as we shall see later ) to express the final flux term in a more indicative way ( in connection with the incompressible exact relations @xcite )",
    ". we can write the expressions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 in an identical way as that of the above .",
    "following the formalism of our previous paper @xcite , we define the relevant two - point correlation functions associated to the total energy and the compressible cross - helicity density as : r_e & = & 2 (  +  ) + e , + r_h & = & 2 (  +  ) , and similarly for the primed quantities . using the above definitions and introducing compressible elssser variables @xmath45 , we obtain : @xmath46 where for any variable @xmath47 , @xmath48 . under ensemble average ( which is equivalent to spatial average for a statistically homogeneous system )",
    "the above relations get reduced to : & - & 1 2 - 1 2 e + & = & 1 4 ( ^ ) ^ .",
    "now we shall calculate : _",
    "t , in order to see how the incompressible relations @xcite can be generalized to the compressible pseudo - energies ( @xmath49 ) which are no more conserved . by using the equations ( [ e1])([e4 ] ) and basic identities of vector calculus , we obtain after some calculations :    _ t (  ) = & - & + - (  ) - ( p  ) - ( 1 2 ^2  ) + & - & (  ) ( ) -  + (  ) (   ) +  - (  ) (   ) + & - &   ( p ) -   ( 1 2  ^2 ) - (  ) (   ) + d_1 + f_1 , + _ t (  ) = & - & + - (  ) [ ( ) ] - 1 2 (  ) ( ) + & - & 1 2 (  ) (   ) - + (  ) (   ) +  + & - & (  ) (   ) + d_2 , + _ t (  ) = & - & + - (  ) [ ( ) ] - ( p  ) - ( 1 2 v_a^2  ) + & - & (  ) ( ) - + (  ) (   ) +  + & - & (  ) (   ) - 1 2 (  ) (   ) + d_3 + f_2 , + _ t (  ) = & - & + - (  ) [ ( ) ] - 1 2 (  ) ( ) + & - &  + (   ) (  ) +  - (  ) (   ) + & - &   -   - (  ) (   ) + d_4 + f_3 , + _ t ( e ) = & - &  ( e  ) - ( e ) -  ( p  ) + e (   ) .",
    "+    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 to @xmath53 ) represent the dissipative and forcing contributions respectively . hence we have all the necessary elements for the dynamic equation of @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ". similarly we can write ( by symmetry ) the expressions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 just by carefully interchanging the primed and the unprimed quantites .",
    "now if we apply statistical averaging operator on each term , after judicious re - arrangement of all the terms we finally obtain :    _ t r_e r_h & + & r_e r_h = _ r + ( e + v_a ^2 2 ) ( ^ ) + & - & 1 4  ( ^e ) + v_a^2 c_s^2 (  ^e ) + & + & ( ) + & + & (   ) + & + & ( ) + & + & (   ) + d_+ f _ ,    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the magnetic pressure . @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent respectively the averaged dissipative and forcing terms .",
    "the above expression consists of two equations which represent the generalized form ( to compressible mhd ) of the coupled equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) of @xcite .",
    "as it was already shown @xcite , for compressible flows the cross - helicity is no longer conserved and we can not ( by equation ( [ eheli ] ) ) let the term @xmath62 vanish to the extent of a stationary state where the average forcing term and the average resultant dissipative ( kinetic + magnetic ) terms cancel each other to ensure the conservation of total energy .",
    "hence for the compressible case , these two equations individually do not lead to an exact relation comprising of a universal quantity .",
    "however , if we add both we find :    _ t r_e + r_e & = & 1 2 _ r + + ( e + v_a^2 2 ) ( ^- + ^+ ) [ toto1 ] + & - & 1 8  ( ^+ e ) + v_a^2 c_s^2",

    "( ^- e ) + v_a^2 c_s^2 (  ^- e ) + & + & ( ) + (   ) + & + & ( ) + (   ) + d + f ,    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . now to establish the final relation",
    ", we assume that in the limit of infinite ( kinetic and magnetic ) reynold s numbers , the system attains a stationary state .",
    "this assumption , when applied to the relation ( [ toto1 ] ) , shows that the left hand term of the above equation vanishes . now",
    "if we concentrate far in the inertial zone where the dissipative terms are negligible with respect to the other terms , we are left with :    - 2&= & 1 2 _ r + + ( e + v_a^2 2 ) ( ^- + ^+ ) [ toto2 ] + & - & 1 8  ( ^+ e ) + 1 (  ^+ e ) + 1   ( ^- e ) + 1 (  ^- e ) + & + & ( ) + (   ) + & + & ( ) + (   ) ,    where @xmath65 denotes the mean total energy injection rate ( which is equal to the mean total energy dissipation rate ) . in the above equation the flux terms are deliberately written in terms of the compressible elssser variables @xmath66 whereas the source terms are expressed in terms of the velocity and the compressible alfvn velocity .",
    "this writing is expected to be useful for ( i ) an attempt to generalize the alfvn effect ( introduced by kraichnan ) to describe the phenomenology of compressible mhd turbulence and ( ii ) understanding separately the contribution of the velocity field and the alfvn term in the source term .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the second part of our flux , the @xmath20 parameter ( @xmath67 ) appears which can help us understand ( or obtain ) the different limits depending upon its value .",
    "the above equation , being considerably bulky , is laborious to handle . for quick references",
    ", we give below a schematic view of that equation : -2 = _ 1 + 1 _ 2 + ( ) s_1 + ( ) s_2 [ toto3 ] .",
    "equation ( [ toto2 ] ) is the main result of the paper .",
    "it is an exact relation for compressible isothermal mhd turbulence in terms of correlation functions . from this equation",
    "we can immediately investigate particular limits .      in this limit , all the source terms vanish .",
    "moreover , the compressible energy term becomes zero ( evident from its definition as for incompressible case @xmath27 = @xmath42 ) and we get finally ( normalising the density to unity ) : -2 = 1 4 _ r ( ^- ) ^2 ^+ + ( ^+ ) ^2 ^- .",
    "note that the term @xmath68 can be shown to be zero in incompressible case by expanding it and letting the @xmath69 enter inside the average operator in a judicious manner .",
    "a rewriting of the @xmath66 in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath70 ( assuming the constant density to be normalised to unity ) help us recognise the primitive form of the equations found in @xcite .",
    "to verify the hydrodynamic limit , we put @xmath71 and so @xmath72 ; we are left with : - 2&= & _ r + e ( ) + & + & ( ) + & + & (   ) [ toto7 ] .",
    "it is nothing but the exact relation which was derived in @xcite .",
    "the only difference between the relation obtained above and that in the published paper is that here the pressure terms are written as the source terms whereas previously those were considered to contribute in flux terms .      without problem",
    "we admit that in the limit where the beta parameter of the plasma tends to infinity ( very large value ) , the plasma becomes almost incompressible ( although not entirely ) , the flux term @xmath74 becomes negligible with respect to @xmath75 of equation ( [ toto3 ] ) . on the contrary for a very small beta value , where the plasma can be assumed to be cold and magnetised ( kinetic pressure negligible with respect to magnetic pressure ) , the term @xmath76 dominates over @xmath77 term and at that situation",
    "the effective flux term becomes ( after rearrangement ) : - 1 4  ( e ) + 1 (   e ) .",
    "relation ( [ toto2 ] ) comprises the total magnetic field at each point of the flow field .",
    "this total field @xmath70 at each point can be supposed ( a realistic case ) to have a fluctuating part ( vary in space and time ) @xmath78 superimposed on a constant external magnetic field @xmath36 . in the following",
    ", we shall investigate the flux and the source terms under the said situation .",
    "the part of the total flux term which contains @xmath36 can be expressed as ( with @xmath79 ) :    _ & = & _ r 2 ( 1 ) ( ) + ( ) - ^2 ( 1 ) .",
    "( 1 ) + b_0 ^2 ( 1 ) ( ) + 2 ( ) + & - & 1 2 ",
    " + ^2  ",
    "+ b_0 ^ 2 2 ^2  ",
    "+ ^2   ,",
    "where @xmath80 .",
    "now we assume the external field @xmath36 to be very strong so that @xmath81 ( and also @xmath82 ) .",
    "we shall just consider the terms weighted by @xmath83 .",
    "after some straightforward calculations , we obtain the resultant flux term ( the magnetic terms without @xmath84 and with single power of @xmath84 are neglected ) which writes at main order : _ & = & _ r 2 ( 1 ) ( ) .",
    "+ & & . - ^2 .",
    "[ toto4 ] the above expression gives the modifying part of the flux in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field applied externally .",
    "one can easily understand that the modification is purely due to compressibility .",
    "( note that the pure kinetic terms ( not shown in ( [ toto4 ] ) ) gives also a contribution to the total flux . )",
    "it is also interesting to notice that in expression ( [ toto4 ] ) the fluctuations are exclusively kinetic in nature ( because of the absence of hall type term in the basic equations ) .",
    "one can easily verify that the @xmath85 of the first term and the @xmath86 of the second term of the above expression can be replaced by @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the pure kinetic terms can however be omitted by assuming the external magnetic contribution to be dominant with respect to the velocity and the density fluctuations and then expression ( [ toto4 ] ) will represent the total flux contribution .",
    "the source terms are also modified due to the effect of a strong external magnetic field . at main order ( keeping only the terms in @xmath83 ) , the terms of type @xmath91 get reduced to : _",
    "= b_0 ^ 2 2 ( ) ( 1 ) ( ) - ( ) , [ toto5 ] and the source terms like @xmath92 writes :",
    "_ = @xmath93 \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath94 \\right\\rangle \\ , .\\ ] ] we note that the latter expression implies only parallel components of the velocity .",
    "further simplifications are possible if we assume that the velocity field vector at each point of the flow field is ( at the main order ) perpendicular to the external magnetic field if @xmath95 , and therefore @xmath96 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath97 vanishes and so is the second term of @xmath98 ; then the corresponding reduced exact relation can be simply written as : - 4 = b_0 ^ 2 _ r _ ( 1 ) ( ) _ [ toto6 ] @xmath99 where @xmath100 implies derivatives transverse to @xmath36 .",
    "expression ( [ toto6 ] ) is the second main result of this paper : it is a limiting case of the exact relation ( [ toto2 ] ) for isothermal compressible mhd turbulence under the influence of a strong external uniform magnetic field ( sub - alfvnic turbulence regime ) .      in this section",
    "we shall make a prediction on compressible spectra using the derived theoretical relation ( [ toto6 ] ) : although simplified , it is considerably indicative for phenomenological intuition .",
    "the existence of strong external magnetic field @xmath101 renders the energy transfer in the parallel ( along @xmath101 ) direction negligible in comparison to the transverse one @xcite .",
    "then , our prediction will be made for transverse spectra ( with a spectral dependence only in @xmath102 ) . from the flux term of expression ( [ toto6 ] ) , we find dimensionally ( keeping the source terms aside ) : ~_v_a ^2 v _ _ ~_v_a ^2 _ / v _ .",
    "the above expression corresponds to a compressible phenomenology in which the magnetic energy density , @xmath103 , is transferred through the scales at the transfer time , @xmath104 , and the transfer rate @xmath65 .",
    "we may define the weighted variables : _ & & _",
    "^1/3 v _ , + b _ & & _",
    "^1/3 v_a = _ ^-1/6 b_0 , which leads to : @xmath105 whence , the spectral prediction : @xmath106    taking into consideration the source terms will only modify @xmath65 for giving an effective mean total energy injection rate @xmath107 ( likewise in compressible hydrodynamics @xcite ) . a compressional effect ( @xmath108 )",
    "will increase the effective energy flux rate whereas a dilatational effect ( @xmath109 ) will reduce @xmath107 as it is evident from the source terms of expression ( [ toto6 ] ) .",
    "additional hypothesis of axisymmetry ( symmetry in the plane perpendicular to @xmath36 ) .",
    "the flux vectors ( dotted arrows ) are always oriented towards the axis of the cylinder since a direct cascade is expected .",
    "dilatation and compression act additionally ( solid arrows ) : in the first case , the effect is similar to a decrease of the local mean total energy transfer rate whereas in the second case it is similar to an increase of the local mean total energy transfer rate .",
    "then , the final prediction for compressible turbulence under a strong uniform magnetic field is : e^b ( k _ ) ~_eff ( k _ ) k_^-5/2 , with _ a priori _ a possible dependence of the effective mean total energy transfer rate on @xmath102 .",
    "it that case , a power law steeper than @xmath110 may be observed at large scales when compressible mhd turbulence becomes supersonic .",
    "the present paper is a generalization of a recent work made for compressible hydrodynamics @xcite in which it was possible to give a simple interpretation of the different terms of the exact relation .",
    "the introduction of both the lorentz force and the induction equation renders the situation more difficult to analyze but it is believed that the main physical characteristic of compressible mhd emerges when a uniform magnetic field is included . in that case , we have derived rigorously a reduced expression ( [ toto6 ] ) which can be used easily either to analyze direct numerical simulations or _ in situ _ observations like those obtained in the solar wind . since most of the natural plasmas are in interaction with a large scale magnetic field , it is likely that the reduced form is the most interesting one .",
    "our work confirms the relevance of density - weighted elssser variables , @xmath111 , for compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "however , unlike the hydrodynamic case , here one should not replace @xmath66 by @xmath111 for recovering the incompressible scaling laws . instead the appropriate variable should be , @xmath112 , for obtaining a satisfactory energy scaling as suggested by relation ( [ toto2 ] ) .",
    "the said relation holds good for any type of compressible mhd turbulence ( subsonic , transonic , supersonic , subalfvnic or superalfvnic ) .",
    "hence it can directly be used to analyze direct numerical simulations in compressible mhd turbulence at different mach numbers or for plasmas with different @xmath20 parameter in order to understand the underlying phenomenology . in order to approach the astrophysical turbulence more efficiently",
    "we have to take into account the gravitational force and also a polytropic closure although they would increase enormously the complexity of the analysis .",
    "it was mentioned in the past that constant flux solutions are in general not relevant for compressible turbulence because the coupling to a sonic field provides a supplementary sink which will modify the inertial index @xcite .",
    "a modification of the solenoidal energy spectrum ( for hydrodynamics turbulence ) was proposed by introducing a simple _ ad hoc _ model in which the main compressible parameter was the mach number . here",
    ", we may reach a similar conclusion with a rigorous analysis in terms of two - point correlation functions .",
    "we believe that our interpretation in terms of effective energy flux rate , source and flux terms are the key ingredients to further understanding of compressible turbulence .",
