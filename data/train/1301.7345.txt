    "constant weight codes and their bounds have been extensively studied in literature ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "binary constant weight codes have recently been used for error correction in random networks @xcite .",
    "the latter involves a choice of the subsets of a given finite set as the code .",
    "if the chosen subsets are all of the same cardinality , the resulting code is a constant weight code .",
    "this code may also be described as an association scheme , the johnson scheme ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the metric for this code may either be the general hamming metric or the johnson metric - as the  distance \" between any two codewords is an even number .",
    "+ properties of constant weight binary codes on power set lattices were discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we exhibit a similar construction of constant weight codes on the elements of _ multiplicative lattices _",
    "@xcite - i.e. lattices on which a residuation operation and its associated multiplication are defined . if all the non - unit elements can be expressed as finite irredundant of certain elements of the lattice ( termed ` primary ' elements ) , the multiplicative lattice is called a _ noether lattice _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "noether lattices are lattice analogues of noetherian rings - commutative rings with an ascending chain condition .",
    "constant weight codes were constructed in @xcite on the ideals of a noetherian ring , which were suitable for network error correction in delay - free , acyclic random networks employing store and forward ( saf ) routing .",
    "we now adapt this construction for noether lattices and show that the ideal - based codes are a special case of the lattice codes .",
    "+ kendziorra and schmidt @xcite interpreted the subspace codes of ktter and kschischang @xcite for error and erasure correction in random networks as codes constructed on the subspace lattice of a finite dimensional vector space over @xmath0 ( also treated in @xcite ) .",
    "they further generalized this construction to the submodule lattices of arbitrary finite modules and computed some bounds on code sizes .",
    "their method exploits the additive structure of modules and the unique linear decomposition of each element of a modular lattice in terms of the ` independent ' spanning set of the lattice .",
    "we focus on the multiplicative structure on the ideals of a ring and on the elements of lattices with unique decomposition with respect to meet .",
    "it can be shown in this context that the lattice of ideals of an arbitrary commutative ring is a modular lattice . moreover , if the ring is noetherian , the ideal lattice is a modular noether lattice , with decomposition of elements in terms of primary elements .",
    "so the properties of codes constructed on multiplicative lattices in general and noether lattices in particular , will be inherited by the codes based on the ideal structure of commutative rings .",
    "+ unlike the case of commutative rings , there exist separate conditions for the existence of unique irredundant decomposition of each lattice element in terms of irreducible elements @xcite , which again does not presuppose modularity .",
    "hence for these lattices having unique irreducible decomposition , the same strategy can be used for construction of constant weight codes , albeit in terms of irreducible elements rather than the primary elements .",
    "+ in the saf routing strategy for data transmission in networks the intermediate nodes retransmit the received packets without any combination . for correcting packet loss ,",
    "the existing techniques include arq and using erasure codes based on reed - solomon codes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "binary error - correcting codes were proposed in @xcite where a modified hamming metric was defined to account for adversarial modifications in the network .",
    "a recent work @xcite proposes codes for saf where the source transmits constant dimensional flats of a matroid .",
    "+ we propose a @xmath1-ary error correction scheme for saf where the source alphabet is a collection of elements of a lattice with unique decomposition .",
    "we consider a single source unicast over a delay - free , acyclic network where no knowledge of the network topology is assumed other than having an upper bound on the in - degree at each node in the network .",
    "hence the model is essentially the same as the random network saf considered in @xcite , @xcite . at each non - source node of the network",
    "a simple processing , equivalent to a binary search algorithm , is performed before retransmission .",
    "the upper bound on the number of incoming nodes is used to provide an estimate of the complexity of this search algorithm .",
    "error correction is achieved in an adversarial model , i.e. we consider the case when corrupt packets are introduced at some network node or nodes and at the destination , the decoder uses a suitable metric to extract the information sent by the source . + in section [ sec : prelim ] we give an overview of multiplicative lattices vis-@xmath2-vis commutative rings . the next section deals with irredundant decompositions of elements in multiplicative lattices and lattices with unique irreducible decompositions .",
    "section [ sec : constwt ] contains a construction of constant weight codes with a suitable distance metric .",
    "some upper bounds and a lower bound on the size of the codes are given in section [ sec : bnd ] . in section [ sec : saf ]",
    "constant weight lattice codes are used for error and erasure correction for saf routing in random networks .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on the scope of the present scheme and possible improvements .",
    "in this section we give an overview of multiplicative lattices and introduce some definitions and concepts .",
    "the conditions for the existence of irredundant primary decomposition in multiplicative lattices are similar to those for the ideals in noetherian commutative rings ; hence we state the analogous concepts in the case of commutative rings for comparison .",
    "+ _ notation _ : we use the standard notations @xmath3 for the set of natural numbers and the finite field with @xmath1 elements , respectively . for a set @xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 denotes the cardinality .",
    "the gothic letters @xmath6 etc . are used to denote the ideals of a ring .",
    "the ideal generated by an element @xmath7 of a ring @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath9 ; for instance , the unit ideal by @xmath10 . for two ideals @xmath11 of a ring , @xmath12 denotes the smallest ideal containing both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .      to characterize multiplicative lattices",
    ", we first define the operation of residuation in lattices and list some relevant properties @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be a lattice with unit element @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath15 is said to be _ residuated _ if there exists a well - defined binary operation @xmath17 for all @xmath18 satisfying the following properties .",
    "@xmath19 ;    @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 ;    @xmath22 and @xmath23 ;    @xmath24 ;    @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    .",
    "in a residuated lattice , there exists an associated multiplication with the following condition : @xmath15 is completely closed with respect to union and the products of the unions of any two sets of elements in @xmath15 equals the union of the products of all pairs of elements in the sets .",
    "hence in conjunction with multiplication , the operation of residuation in lattices is governed by the following defining relations :    @xmath27 ;    if @xmath28 then @xmath29 .",
    "there is an evident analogy between residuation in multiplicative lattices and the operation of ideal quotients in commutative rings : for ideals @xmath30 and @xmath31 in a commutative ring @xmath8 , the ideal quotient @xmath32 .",
    "a comparison of some definitions and concepts for multiplicative lattices with their analogues in commutative rings is presented in table @xmath33 .",
    "we conclude this subsection with two concepts related to primary decomposition of elements in lattices .",
    "a meet of primary elements @xmath34 is said to be _ simple _ if @xmath35 .    a prime element @xmath36 is said to be an _ associated prime _ of a primary element @xmath1 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    [ comp ]    .comparison of lattices and rings [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the columns @xmath39 and @xmath40 indicate whether the first ( restricted ) or the second ( unrestricted ) johnson bound is applicable , respectively . a parameter set marked with the asterisk indicates a case where the johnson bound is not achieved and then the values @xmath41 in the columns @xmath39 or @xmath40 indicate the size of the maximal subgraphs obtained by cliquer versus the computed bound .",
    "the last column @xmath42 gives the number of maximal cliques or subgraphs of the given size available .",
    "for instance , an optimal @xmath43 constant weight code is a maximal subgraph in the generalized johnson graph @xmath44 comprising distinct @xmath45-element subsets of a set of @xmath46 elements such that every pair of distinct subsets differ in at least @xmath47 places .",
    "there are @xmath48 maximal subsets of size @xmath49 ; choosing any of them will give an optimal @xmath43 constant weight code which achieves the first johnson bound . for example , labelling the set of constituent elements as @xmath50 , a constant weight code is given by @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "in this section we give an application of constant weight codes over lattices with unique decomposition in error and erasure correction for saf routing in random networks .",
    "we consider a single source communicating over a delay - free acyclic network to a single sink , i.e. a single unicast .",
    "there is no knowledge of the network topology assumed except for the following : at any intermediate node and at the sink , the number of incoming nodes is at most n.      as in the previous section , we begin with a source alphabet @xmath53 which is a set of decomposable elements of a suitable lattice @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we choose each element of the source alphabet such that it admits a ( primary or irreducible ) decomposition into exactly @xmath54 constituent elements which do not divide one another .",
    "we denote the set of all such constituent elements by @xmath55 ; let @xmath56 and the source alphabet is uniquely identified with a subset of @xmath57 , the set of @xmath58-subsets of @xmath59 . + we choose a finite field @xmath60 with cardinality @xmath61 and define an injective map @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "next we define : @xmath64 at the source , the encoder performs this mapping and sends out the corresponding element of @xmath65 , a row vector over @xmath60 of length @xmath54 , as a single packet .      in one ` generation ' , packets of @xmath66-ary symbols arrive at each intermediate node from its incoming edges .",
    "initially , all the incoming symbols are stored in a single array .",
    "if the number of incoming edges at each node is bounded above by n , the maximum length of the array required to store the incoming symbols during one transmission interval is n@xmath54 .",
    "the intermediate node now extracts @xmath54 distinct symbols from the array , forms a packet and transmits it .",
    "the extraction of @xmath54 distinct symbols may be performed by constructing a binary search tree with repeated label rejection on the array of symbols : an algorithm of complexity @xmath67 @xcite . in the worst case scenario , the complexity",
    "will always be bounded by @xmath68 .",
    "if less than @xmath54 distinct symbols are extracted at any node during one generation , the node declares a failure and transmission is suppressed from that node into the network .      at the sink ,",
    "the incoming symbols are again stored in an array and @xmath54 distinct elements are extracted in a similar manner as in the intermediate nodes . if less than @xmath54 distinct symbols are extracted at the sink , a @xmath54-symbol packet is created by adding the required number of zeros .",
    "finally each symbol is operated on by the following map : @xmath69 from the resulting array , the non - zero elements are selected and the resulting set of constituent elements ( of cardinality @xmath70 ) is fed into the decoder which gives an estimate of the transmitted @xmath54-subset of constituent elements based on the symmetric distance metric as discussed in the previous section . finally , the transmitted decomposable element of the source alphabet is retrieved by computing the meet of the estimated constituent elements .",
    "to discuss the error and erasure correcting capability of the proposed code , we first define errors and erasures in the context of the proposed scheme . recovering a complete set of @xmath54 distinct constituent elements at the sink which is different from the transmitted set constitutes an _ error _ event , while recovering an incomplete set is an _ erasure _ event . as discussed above",
    ", each codeword of a code is a set of distinct constituent elements of a suitable lattice .",
    "it follows that a constant weight code @xmath71 based on constituent elements can correct upto @xmath72 errors in absence of erasures if and only if @xmath73 , i.e. any two distinct sets of constituent elements belonging to the code differ in at least @xmath74 places",
    ". however it can detect @xmath75 errors if @xmath76 .",
    "but in the absence of errors , the code can correct @xmath77 erasures if and only if @xmath78 .",
    "hence it follows that the proposed coding scheme has asymmetric error and erasure correction capability - the `` cost '' associated with an error is twice that of an erasure .",
    "+ for instance , suppose we are using the @xmath79 constant weight lattice code ( described in section [ sec : constwt ] ) for saf routing .",
    "it follows that that the code can correct a single erasure in the absence of errors and can detect a single error .",
    "let the set @xmath80 be the transmitted codeword .",
    "if the sink receives a set @xmath81 there are three contending codewords at the same distance from the received set and the decoder detects an error . if the sink receives an incomplete set with a single erasure , the decoding rule readily yields the transmitted codeword .",
    "+ _ remark _ : as each codeword of an @xmath82 constant weight lattice code @xmath71 is transmitted as a set of @xmath66-ary symbols over the network , the normalized rate of the codeword may be defined as @xmath83 . since @xmath84 can at most equal @xmath85",
    ", it follows that the code rate is in the interval @xmath86 .",
    "we have constructed constant weight codes on classes of lattices using the unique decomposition of lattice elements in terms of prime and irreducible elements .",
    "primary element decomposition in noether lattices is an abstraction of primary ideal decomposition in noetherian commutative rings and the ideal lattice of a noetherian ring is a modular noether lattice .",
    "so we have achieved a generalization of the codes constructed in @xcite on the ideals of noetherian rings .",
    "it is seen that the existence of unique irreducible decomposition in lattices is not a special case of primary decomposition as in commutative rings but requires a different set of conditions . however , the unique prime decomposition of ideals in a dedekind domain is an example of unique irreducible decomposition in lattices as well .",
    "bounds constructed for constant weight codes in @xcite have been restated in the setting of lattices , as the encoding exploits the properties of the johnson graph on the finite subsets of a set of elements in both cases .",
    "we have also reformulated the application of codes based on ideals of noetherian rings for store - and - forward ( saf ) routing in random networks in terms of lattice - based codes . + as seen in section [ sec : constwt ] , optimal constant weight codes have been obtained as maximal subgraphs in the johnson graph on the subsets of constituent elements of a suitable lattice .",
    "moreover , when the restricted johnson bound is achievable , an optimal code can be realized as a maximal clique of the generalized johnson graph . for a number of small parameters , it has been found that the largest subgraph of the corresponding johnson graph achieves the unrestricted bound as well .",
    "but it is seen that , in general , both the restricted and unrestricted johnson bounds are loose .",
    "hence a natural question is to relate the maximal clique / maximal subgraph with the sharper bounds .",
    "this might be achieved with an algebraic description for the optimal codes so obtained by search for maximal subgraphs on the johnson graph on the subsets of constituent elements of lattices with unique decomposition .",
    "finally , the construction of constant weight codes on multiplicative lattices presented in this paper have potential application in non - linear network coding for deterministic networks , where the networks can be modelled as suitable multiplicative lattices .",
