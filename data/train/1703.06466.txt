    "research interest in magnetic materials has gained its spectacular boost after the discovery of exotic magnetic properties [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "additionally , continued device miniaturization has also opened up many research opportunities to reveal the magnetic properties of these nanostructures in hope for potential applications in spintronics and catalysis . at present , investigations on magnetic nanostructure are directed towards clusters of transition metals ( tm ) .",
    "this is due to their large magnetic moments as the dimensionality and coordination ( bonds per atom ) of the tm cluster are reduced [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "however , their net magnetic moments can also become decreased , depending on the configuration ( ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic geometries ) and surrounding of the clusters [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "it is desirable to study the magnetic properties of a tm cluster which is evenly bound to an inert substrate such that the magnetic moment is comparable to that of a cluster in isolation .",
    "the interaction of tm atoms with certain metal surfaces is known to be very strong [ 8,9 ] .",
    "this could potentially affect their net magnetic moments .",
    "in contrast , carbon nanostructures are known to be inert , and stand as the right candidate for encapsulation of tm atoms .",
    "considering two - dimensional carbon nanostructures as substrates , many efforts have been devoted to study the physical and chemical properties of bound tm clusters on graphene [ 6,7,10 ] and boron nitride [ 11,12 ] sheets . however , previous works have shown that tm atoms bind weakly on graphene and boron nitride monolayers [ 7,12,13 ] .",
    "such a weak binding may render tm atoms to diffuse easily on the surface and aggregate to form clusters .",
    "many attempts have been made to create defects in the aforementioned surfaces to prevent the diffusion .",
    "however , not much success [ 12 ] has been achieved due to technical impracticability to realize controlled defect formation in compacted hexagonal 2d surfaces .",
    "binding of dispersed tm atoms on the surfaces of graphene and other related 2d monolayers presents a practical challenge .",
    "to practically produce controllable nanostructures with desired magnetic properties without altering the physical properties of the bound structures is not technically trivial .",
    "such a challenge has led to the discovery of a new set of graphitic carbon - nitride ( cn ) sheets [ 14 ] .",
    "graphitic cn sheet comes naturally with a regular array of cavities which is wide enough to accommodate any nanostructures that are evenly dispersed .",
    "cn sheet has many graphitic allotropes depending on the choice of the primitive unit cell and the c and n atomic coverage in their hexagonal rings .",
    "for example , the semiconducting heptazine ( _ t_-_s_-triazine ) sheet comprises of 14 c and n atoms in the form of three abreast rings of triazine ( consisting of 3 c and 4 n atoms in the unit cell ) [ 15 ] whereas _ s_-triazine sheet of similar electronic character consists of 12 c and n atoms having two rings of triazines linked together by c - c bond [ 16 ] . both aforementioned allotropes are found to be structurally , energetically and mechanically stable under ambient conditions [ 15 - 17 ] .     having explained the motivation for the choice of graphitic cn sheet over the rest of 2d sheets with compacted hexagonal rings , the embedment of single atoms on the pure graphitic cn sheet has been the most recent interest for many theoretical [ 18 - 21 ] and few experimental [ 22 - 25 ] studies.the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of b , al , and cu atoms doped graphitic triazine - based _",

    "their results have shown that cu atoms are more stable when situated above the center of the triazine ring . moreover , they have reported that doping at the interstitial sites leads to thermodynamically stable non - planar structures .",
    "it is found that cu - doped triazine produces a total magnetic moment of 1.0  _ _",

    "the electronic property of cu - doped triazine systems calculated based on gga - pbe and hse06 method exhibits half - metallic behavior .",
    "the cu - doped triazine system has an anti - ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "they did not estimate the curie temperature for cu - doped triazine system due to the fact that long - range magnetic ordering is usually favorable for the system having ferromagnetic order at zero temperature .",
    "the energetic , electronic , magnetic and optical properties of two - dimensional graphitic carbon nitride ( _ g_-c~3~n~4~ ) sheets upon embedment of 3d - transition metal ( tm ) atoms have been investigated by ghosh _",
    "et al_. the _ g_-c~3~n~4~  sheets with embedded tm atoms are found to be energetically stable when located in the porous sites .",
    "it was also reported that the system becomes metallic upon tm ( including cu ) embedment .",
    "the d orbitals of tms hybridize with the @xmath2-orbitals of the _",

    "the magnetic moment of the 3d tm atoms are well preserved when compared to their isolated values",
    ". however , mn atoms couples antiferromagnetically whereas cu and zn atoms are nonmagnetic in the ground state of their corresponding tm-_g_-c~3~n~4~  sheets [ 21 ] . the claims for magnetic ordering in mn , cu embedded _",
    "g_-c~3~n~4~ sheets and metallic behavior for cu embedded system at relatively the same separations are in contrast to what was observed by zhang _",
    "[ 20 ] and meng _ et al . _",

    "[ 27 ] suggest that mn and cu atom embedded in c~2~n monolayers possess ferromagnetic and paramagnetic ground state respectively when the tm atoms are close to each other , while meng _ et al_. [ 26 ] observed antiferromagnetic ground state with half - metallic electronic character for cu - doped triazine system . in general ,",
    "the claim for magnetic ordering of tm atoms embedded in cn remains unclear .",
    "however , it is feasible to envisage that if the embedded tm atoms were well separated , the possible interactions among themselves could be minimized .",
    "the effort to clarify the magnetic ordering issue hence could become less complicated .",
    "more recently , choudhuri _ et al .",
    "_ [ 27 ] investigated newly formed allotrope of the carbon - nitride monolayer ( _ gt_-c~3~n~3~ ) with embedded 3d transition metal atoms ( tm@gt - c~3~n~3~ ) systems based on density functional theory .",

    "gt_-c~3~n~3~  systems are dynamical , thermally and mechanically stable .",
    "moreover , cr , mn and fe embedded in the _ gt_-c~3~n~3~  systems have been found to exhibit high temperature ferromagnetism and high magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) with a peak value per atom occurring in cr@_gt_-c~3~n~3~. their finding for the ferromagnetic ordering of mn atom in similar graphitic cn sheet under ambient conditions agrees well with that reported by du _",
    "[ 27 ] further claimed a more enhanced mae in the presence of an external electric field , an amount far larger than the value computed without electric field .     in our recent studies",
    ", it was shown that the band gap of heptazine with embedded mn atom increases under small biaxial tensile strain whereas the magnetic moment of heptazine with embedded mn systems remain unperturbed under both tensile strain and applied electric field [ 18 ] .",
    "it was also observed that the binding energy of heptazine with embedded mn atom systems decreases as more tensile strain is applied .",
    "in contrast , we observed significant increase in binding energy as the strength of electric filed is increased . modulating binding energy via an applied external field",
    "could serve as an effect way to control catalytic process .",
    "besides spintronics , cn with embedded tm systems can also be utilized for heterogeneous catalysis and in membrane for hydrogen purification from other gases [ 29 - 31 ] .",
    "heterogeneous catalysis based on single atomic crystal ( sac ) is the cheapest and easiest way of achieving efficient catalysis . to date , various 2d sheets have been theoretically and experimentally proposed for heterogeneous catalysis [ 32 - 37 ] . among others , monolayers",
    "carbon and related 2d nanostructures , e.g. boron nitride [ 32,33 ] , graphene [ 34,35 ] , graphyne [ 36 ] , silicene [ 37 ] , carbon nitride sheet [ 35 ] have received enormous attentions due to their availability , thermal stability and large surface area .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have shown that graphene with embedded au , fe and pt [ 34,38,39 ] atoms yield good catalytic activity for co oxidation and oxygen reduction . experimentally ,",
    "excellent catalytic activities have been reported for graphene with supported single pd and pt using monolayer deposition method [ 29,40 ] .",
    "although favorable catalytic process has been reported for sacs of graphene and related 2d materials , the adsorption / binding energies of 3d atoms on their surfaces are relatively weak and could result in formation of cluster that renders reduction in catalytic activity .",
    "2d porous carbon sheets embedded with tm atoms [ 14,16 ] are desirable sacs that can serve as membrane for hydrogen purification from other gases [ 30,31 ] .",
    "this is because they naturally come with regularly array of cavities .",
    "these cavities are reported to strongly bind to 3d tm while maintaining structural and electronic features of the sheets [ 18,21 ] .",
    "a recent work along this direction has confirmed theoretically that it is possible to synthesize high quality sacs using porous 2d materials with well dispersed 3d tm atoms .",
    "more importantly , the 3d tm atoms are found to strongly bind to the c~2~n sheet in the cavity without cluster formation , while the intrinsic properties of both porous substrate and the atoms are preserved [ 41 ] .     in this paper , we are interested to theoretically study the geometries , electronic and magnetic properties of tm - embedded graphitic systems in which different types of atoms and molecules are made to adsorbed onto their surfaces . to be specific ,",

    "s_-triazine sheet is an allotrope of graphitic carbon nitride which shares some structural similarities with c~2~n sheet .",
    "it also comes with well separated porous sites which will ensure no interactions between the embedded tm atoms .",
    "mn is chosen instead of other 3d tm species due to its well - ordered spin configurations in the d orbital and desirable characteristics for sac applications which was reported in previous works .",

    "we find that the calculated optimized bond length between the embedded mn atom and the adsorbed atoms , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , varies only slightly in the range 1.70 - 1.92  _ _ .",
    "this range of value confirms the expected covalent bond length between the mn and the adatoms ( adsorbed atoms ) . to quantify the extent of chemisorption of the adsorbates on mn - c~6~n~6~ sheet , we compute their adsorption energies defined in the eq .",
    "( 5 ) below ,    @xmath31    where _",
    "e~t~ _ is the total energy of mn - c~6~n~6~ with adsorbates , @xmath32 represents the energy of mn - c~6~n~6~ system , and _ _",
    "e__~x~ is the total energy of an isolated atom or molecules .",
    "positive adsorption energy shows a stable structure . as illustrated in table",
    "[ table3 ] , n atom has the lowest adsorption energy and the weakest covalent bond length .",
    "this can be related to the nature of interaction between the mn and n atom , in which nitrogen is the most electronegative among the adatoms . in general , the adsorption energies and their corresponding bond lengths show that the structures are stable and all atoms are chemically bonded to the embedded mn atom in the c~6~n~6~ sheet .",
    "the total magnetic moment per unit cell and per atom are also shown in table  [ table3 ] . unlike the mn - c~6~n~6~ system , the magnetic moment per unit cell are found to be reduced when atoms are adsorbed on the mn - c~6~n~6~ sheet .",
    "the order of magnetic moment of mn - c~6~n~6~ with adatoms is c > n > o > h .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ table3 ] , magnetism is mainly contributed by the mn atom , and the adatoms couple antiferromagnetically with the embedded mn atom . to clarify the reason for reduction in total magnetic moment per unit cell ,",
    "we have evaluated the charge transfer into the c~6~n~6~ sheet and adatoms in the structure .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the reduction is a consequence of electron injection into the c~6~n~6~ sheet from the adatoms and mn .",
    "such an electron redistribution between the orbitals of mn and the surrounding atoms induces strong interaction .",
    "the interaction reduces the number of spin - polarized electrons of mn atom .",
    "consequently , these low - spin configurations lead to the reduction of the system s total magnetic moment .",
    "the tdos of mn - c~6~n~6~ with adsorbed atoms are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in spite of hybridization between the adatoms and the embedded mn atom ,",
    "the electronic structures of the majority of the systems remain semiconducting with their respective band gaps listed in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the tdos for mn - c~6~n~6~ with adsorbed o atom shows half metallic electronic character .       six molecules ( ch~4~ , n~2~ , o~2~",
    ", h~2~ , co , co~2~ ) adsorbed at a height of 2 @xmath33 above the porous sites in the mn - c~6~n~6~ sheet are considered .",
    "we do not impose any geometry constraint during structural relaxation . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( i )  ( vi ) , the mn - c~6~n~6~ sheet remains planar with no sign of buckling in the structure after relaxation .",
    "the optimized bond length between the embedded mn atom and the nearest atom in the adsorbed molecules @xmath29 _ _ are in the range 2.1 - 2.6 @xmath33 and the adsorption energies are in the range of 0.11 - ~ 0.76 ev .",
    "the optimized bond lengths for isolated molecules in all cases , except oxygen , are maintained after adsorption .",
    "based on the previous report [ 41 ] , the interaction between embedded 3d tm and o~2~ is usually strong ; we have confirmed this assertion for the embedded mn atom with adsorbed o~2~. we note that mn - c~6~n~6~ with adsorbed o~2~ has the highest adsorption energy and lowest optimized bond length , @xmath34 , due to strong chemisorption .",
    "the bond length of the isolated o~2~ is slightly lower than the bond length of the adsorbed o~2~. this finding is consistent with the previous work [ 41 ] .",
    "interestingly , @xmath35 is the largest among all @xmath29 , showing that co is the weakest of all molecules that bind to the surface .",
    ", correspondingly , its adsorption energy is also low .",
    "the weak chemisorption energy for co confirms the previously reported assertion that o~2~ would preferentially cover the mn - c~6~n~6~ as compared to co when the two gases are simultaneously released at constant pressure on the surface [ 41 ] .",
    "their conclusion was reached based on the calculation that assumes o~2~ has larger adsorption energy as compared to that of co molecule . here",
    "we would like to contribute to the understanding of adsorption of o~2~ and co based on our previous computations of binding energies of mn - c~6~n~6~ systems under bi - axial tensile strain and applied perpendicular electric field .",
    "the binding energy is found to reduce under symmetric deformation induced by bi - axial tensile strain , and increase as larger electric field strength is applied .",
    "therefore , these external environments can be used to modulate the adsorption energy .",
    "for example , the adsorption energy for o~2~ shows decreasing pattern from 0.789 ev @ 0.5% to 0.658 @ 1% as larger symmetric deformations ( biaxial tensile strain ) are applied .",
    "correspondingly , adsorption energy of co on mn - c~6~n~6~ becomes larger from 0.189 ev @ 1 v / nm to 0.243 @ 2",
    "v / nm * * as larger electric field strengths are applied .",
    "we hope that the two methods of modulating the adsorption energy could be useful in the single crystal field ( sac ) application .",
    "the adsorption energies for ch~4~ , n~2~ , h~2~ molecules on mn - c~6~n~6~ are in agreement with recent adsorption energies reported for the same molecules adsorbed on pure c~6~n~6~ [ 54 ] . however , due to interactions between the embedded mn atom and the molecules , the corresponding @xmath29 are found to be lower . our calculated adsorption energy for co~2~ is within the value suggested by deng _",
    "[ 55 ] , and the molecule is slightly physisorbed on mn - c~6~n~6~ sheet .",
    "the total magnetic moments per unit cell for molecular adsorption on mn - c~6~n~6~ are comparable to mn - c~6~n~6~ except for the o~2~ molecule . as for previous cases , this observation can be explained in terms of electron redistribution between the orbitals in mn atom and the surrounding atoms ( o adatoms included ) induced by strong interaction among themselves .",
    "this causes the number of spin - polarized electrons of mn atom to become reduced .",
    "the consequent low - spin configurations resulted from reduction in number of unpaired electron renders the total magnetic moment to reduce .",
    "we have also calculated the charge transfer into the c~6~n~6~ sheet and adatoms in the structure .",
    "it is evident that the reduced unpaired electrons are resulted from the electron injection into the c~6~n~6~ sheet and the adatoms from mn atom .",
    "the tdos of mn - c~6~n~6~ with adsorbed molecules are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( i )  ( vi ) .",
    "except mn - c~6~n~6~ with adsorbed o~2~ molecule showing half metallic character , all the remaining systems have their semiconducting electronic structure maintained .",
    "the band gaps are listed in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "in this work , mechanical , structural , electronic and magnetic properties of c~6~n~6~ with embedded mn atom is studied systematically under the influence of external environment using density functional theory calculation .",
    "the mn - c~6~n~6~ is found to be structurally and mechanically stable .",
    "our results show that the binding energy of mn embedded in c~6~n~6~ decrease as larger tensile strain is applied .",
    "the decrease in binding energy can be related to the structural distortion of the c~6~n~6~ sheet .",
    "we find that the semiconducting property of the pure sheet is preserved after the embedment of mn atom in porous site .",
    "we have shown a linear relation in the increment of band gap and applied bi - axial tensile strain imposed on the mn - c~6~n~6~ systems .",
    "magnetic moment of the embedded mn atom is preserved in all cases .",
    "additionally , mn - c~6~n~6~ sheet slightly buckles after structural relaxation under the influence of applied perpendicular electric field . despite the obvious wrinkles in the mn - c~6~n~6~ structure",
    ", the electronic and magnetic properties of the mn - c~6~n~6~ systems are maintained up to a peak value of 10 v / nm in electric field strength .",

    "the total magnetic moment per unit cell in most of the systems is found to reduce as compared to that for mn - c~6~n~6~ sheet .",
