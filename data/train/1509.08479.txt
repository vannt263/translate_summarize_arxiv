    "the count rates at observations a , b , c and d are 0.013 , 0.017 , 0.016 and 0.016 counts per second in the 1550  kev band , respectively .",
    "the contaminations from igr j20216 + 4359 accounts for about 60 and 80% of the excess count rates at observations a and b , respectively . on the other hand , there are no excess count rates at observations c and d. the count rates from off - axis igr j20216 + 4359 at observations c and d were 2.0 and 3.2 times larger than the observed count rates in the 1550  kev band , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the flux of igr j20216 + 4359 were varied . since the flux of igr j20216 + 4359 was varied , we can not constrain the origin of the hard band excess in observations a and b. therefore , we regard the flux detected at observation b is an upper limit of the hard band excess from wr  140 ( @xmath221 , see table  [ tb : t3 - 5 ] ) . _ astro - h _ and",
    "_ nustar _ , which have hard x - ray imaging instruments with high sensitivity , will be useful to verify the existence of the hard band excess .    in the colliding - wind region , first - order diffusive shock acceleration results in the production of a power - law spectrum with index 2 for electrons ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit photon index ( @xmath222 1.7 ) indeed approximates a photon index for non - thermal electron energy distribution . @xcite",
    "discuss the photon index of the non - thermal emission from wr  140 .",
    "they expected that the photon index is 1.7 above the energy of 1 mev .",
    "our fitting results are consistent with it , although our results have a large error . according to @xcite ,",
    "the luminosity ratio of inverse compton to synchrotron radiation can be written as @xmath223 , where the magnetic field @xmath224 is expressed in g , @xmath225 is the distance from the colliding - wind zone to the o star in au , and @xmath226 is the o star luminosity in @xmath227 units .",
    "for example , during observation b , if we suppose @xmath228 ( see table  [ tb : t3 - 5 ] ) , @xmath229 for a distance of 1.67 kpc ( phase@xmath620.93 ; @xcite ) , @xmath230 @xcite , and @xmath231 , the total value of the magnetic field for observation b is @xmath2321  g. because of the difficulty of measuring the magnetic field of the w - r stellar surface , the value of the magnetic field around the w - r star will be helpful to study the evolution of the massive star .",
    "we have observed the colliding - wind binary wr  140 around the 2009 periastron passage with the _ suzaku _ satellite .",
    "the following are the salient results .",
    "* we discovered a cool component .",
    "the absorption to this component is smaller than that to the other components .",
    "we infer that this component extends out farther than the other components does .",
    "arguably this component may represent a transitional phase from the compressed hot gas to dust formation . *",
    "the luminosity of the hot component is not inversely proportional to the binary separation .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained if the o - star wind collides with the w - r star wind before it has reached its terminal velocity , leading to a reduction in its wind momentum flux .",
    "this interpretation needs to be verified by future theoretical modelings . * as wr  140 approaches periastron , the column density of the hot component increases .",
    "the column densities at near periastron are reproduced well with a simple model , in which the absorption is occurred in the w - r wind and the x - ray emitting region is fairly compact .",
    "* we detected a hard x - ray signal above 10 kev in the hxd / pin data .",
    "however , we could not eliminate the possibility of contamination from the background source igr j20216 + 4359 , 17.3 arcmin north - east of wr  140 .",
    "the pin data gives the upper - limit for the x - ray luminosity of wr  140 , 8@xmath233 .",

    "<S> _ suzaku _ observations of the wolf - rayet binary wr 140 ( wc7pd@xmath0o5.5fc ) were made at four different times around periastron passage in 2009 january . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra changed in shape and flux with the phase . as periastron approached , the column density of the low - energy absorption increased , which indicates that the emission from the wind - wind collision plasma was absorbed by the dense w - r wind . </S>",

    "<S> the emission measure of the dominant , hot component is not inversely proportional to the distance between the two stars . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the o star wind colliding before it has reached its terminal velocity , leading to a reduction in its wind momentum flux . at phases closer to periastron </S>",
