    "attempts to circumvent this disability with more generalized measurements also fail @xcite .",
    "quantum teleportation was first proposed to transport an unknown state of any discrete quantum system , e.g. , a spin-@xmath0 particle @xcite . in order to accomplish the teleportation",
    ", classical and quantum methods must go hand in hand .",
    "a part of the information encoded in the unknown input state is transmitted via the quantum correlations between two separated subsystems in an entangled state shared by the sender and the receiver .",

    "important steps toward the experimental implementation of quantum teleportation of single - photon polarization states have already been accomplished @xcite . however , a complete realization of the original teleportation proposal @xcite has not been achieved in these experiments , as either the state to be teleported is not independently coming from the outside @xcite or destructive detection of the photons in the teleported state is employed as part of the protocol @xcite . in the latter case , a teleported state did not emerge for subsequent examination or exploitation .",

    "the scheme with continuous quadrature amplitudes of a single mode enables an _  a priori \" _ ( or  unconditional \" ) teleportation with high efficiency @xcite , as reported in refs .  .",
    "in this experiment , three criteria necessary for quantum teleportation were achieved :    \\1 .",

    "a teleported state emerges from the receiving station for subsequent evaluation or exploitation",
    "the degree of overlap between the input and the teleported states is higher than that which could be achieved if the sending and the receiving stations were linked only by a classical channel .    in continuous - variable teleportation ,",
    "the teleportation process acts on an infinite - dimensional hilbert space instead of the two - dimensional hilbert space for the discrete spin variables .",
    "however , an arbitrary electromagnetic field has an infinite number of modes , or in other words , a finite bandwidth containing a continuum of modes .",
    "thus , the teleportation of the quantum state of a broadband electromagnetic field requires the teleportation of a quantum state which is defined in the tensor product space of an infinite number of infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the treatment of ref .   to the case of a broadband field , and thereby to provide the theoretical foundation for laboratory investigations as in refs .  .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the two - mode squeezed state output of a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) @xcite is a suitable epr ingredient for the efficient teleportation of a broadband electromagnetic field .    in the three above mentioned teleportation experiments , in innsbruck @xcite , in rome @xcite , and in pasadena @xcite , the nonorthogonal input states to be teleported were single - photon polarization states ( `` qubits '' ) @xcite and coherent states @xcite . from a true quantum teleportation device , however",

    "this teleportation of one half of an entangled state ( `` entanglement swapping '' @xcite ) means to entangle two quantum systems that have never directly interacted with each other . for discrete variables ,",
    "a demonstration of entanglement swapping with single photons has been reported by pan _",
    "_ @xcite . for continuous variables",
    ", experimental entanglement swapping has not yet been realized in the laboratory , but there have been several theoretical proposals of such an experiment .",
    "polkinghorne and ralph @xcite suggested teleporting polarization - entangled states of single photons using squeezed - state entanglement where the output correlations are verified via bell inequalities .",
    "tan @xcite and van loock and braunstein @xcite considered the unconditional teleportation ( without post selection of `` successful '' events by photon detections ) of one half of a two - mode squeezed state using different protocols and verification .",
    "based on the single - mode scheme of ref .  , we will also present a broadband description of continuous - variable entanglement swapping .",

    "the entangled state is sent in two halves : one to `` alice '' ( the teleporter or sender ) and the other one to `` bob '' ( the receiver ) , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to perform the teleportation , alice has to couple the input mode she wants to teleport with her `` epr mode '' at a beam splitter .",
    "the `` bell detection '' of the @xmath3 quadrature at one beam splitter output , and of the @xmath4 quadrature at the other output , yields the classical results to be sent to bob via a classical communication channel . in the limit of an infinitely squeezed epr source ,",
    "these classical results contain no information about the mode to be teleported .",
    "this is analogous to the bell - state measurement of the spin-@xmath0-particle pair by alice for the teleportation of a spin-@xmath0-particle state .",
    "the measured bell state of the spin-@xmath0-particle pair determines whether the particles have equal or different spin projections .",

    ", we call alice s quadrature measurements for the teleportation of the state of a single mode ( and of a multimode field in the following sections ) `` bell detection . '' due to this bell detection , the entanglement between alice s `` epr mode '' and bob s `` epr mode '' means that suitable phase - space displacements of bob s mode convert it into a replica of alice s unknown input mode ( a perfect replica for infinite squeezing ) . in order to perform these displacements",
    ", bob needs the classical results of alice s bell measurement .",
    "the previous protocol for the quantum teleportation of continuous variables used the wigner distribution and its convolution formalism @xcite .",

    "both output modes become infinitely noisy , but also the epr correlations between them become ideal : @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",

    "i.e. , no squeezing and hence no entanglement , each of the teleported quadratures has _ two _ additional units of vacuum noise compared to the original input quadratures .",
    "these two units are so - called quantum duties or  quduties \" which have to be paid when crossing the border between quantum and classical domains @xcite .",
    "the two quduties represent the minimal tariff for every `` classical teleportation '' scheme @xcite .",
    "one quduty , the unit of vacuum noise due to alice s detection , arises from her attempt to simultaneously measure the two conjugate variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "it can be interpreted as the standard quantum limit imposed on state broadcasting .",
    "the teleportation scheme with alice and bob is complete without any further measurement .",

    "we assume that he prepares the initial input state ( drawn from a fixed set of states ) and passes it on to alice . after accomplishing the supposed teleportation",

    "for that purpose , however , victor needs some measure that helps him to assess when the similarity between the teleported state and the input state exceeds a boundary that is only exceedable with entanglement .      the single - mode teleportation scheme from ref .",
    "works for arbitrary input states , described by any wigner function @xmath28 .",
    "teleporting states with a coherent amplitude as reliably as possible requires unit - gain teleportation ( unit gain in bob s final displacement ) . only in this case",
    ", the coherent amplitudes of the teleported mode always match those of the input mode when victor draws states with different amplitudes from the set of input states in a sequence of trials . for this unit - gain teleportation ,",
    "the teleported state @xmath29 is a convolution of the input @xmath28 with a complex gaussian of variance @xmath30 .",
    "classical teleportation with @xmath24 then means the teleported mode has an excess noise of two units of vacuum @xmath31 compared to the input , as also discussed in the previous section .",
    "any @xmath32 beats this classical scheme , i.e. , if the input state is always recreated with the right amplitude and less than two units of vacuum excess noise , we may call this already quantum teleportation .",
    "let us derive this result using the least noisy model for classical communication .",
    "for the input quadratures of alice s sending station and the output quadratures at bob s receiving station , the least noisy ( linear ) model if alice and bob are only classically communicating can be written as @xmath33 this model takes into account that alice and bob can only communicate via classical signals , since arbitrarily many copies of the output mode can be made by bob where the subscript @xmath34 labels the @xmath34th copy .",

    "since bob always wants to reproduce the input amplitude , he is restricted to unit gain , symmetric in both quadratures , @xmath43 .",
    "first , after obtaining the output states from bob , victor verifies if their amplitudes match the corresponding input amplitudes .",
    "if not , all the following considerations concerning the excess noise are redundant , because alice and bob can always manipulate this noise by fiddling the gain ( less than unit gain reduces the excess noise ) . if victor finds overlapping amplitudes in all trials ( at least within some error range )",

    "ralph and lam @xcite require their classical limits be simultaneously exceeded , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this is only possible using more than 3 db squeezing in the entanglement source @xcite .",
    "apparently , these criteria determine a classical boundary different from ours in eq .",

    "for example , in unit - gain teleportation , our inequality eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) is violated for any nonzero squeezing @xmath32 .",
    "let us briefly explain why we encounter this discrepancy .",
    "we have a priori assumed unit gain in our scheme to achieve outputs and inputs overlapping in their mean values .",
    "this assumption is , of course , motivated by the assessment that good teleportation means good similarity between input and output _ states _ ( here , to be honest , we already have something in mind similar to the fidelity , introduced in the next section ) . first , victor has to check the match of the amplitudes before looking at the variances .",
    "ralph and lam permit arbitrary gain , because they are not interested in the similarity of input and output _ states _ , but in certain correlations that manifest separately in the individual quadratures @xcite .",
    "this point of view originates from the context of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements @xcite , which are focused on a single qnd variable while the conjugate variable is not of interest . for arbitrary gain , an inequality as in eq .",
    "( [ ralph2 ] ) , containing the input and output mean values , has to be added to an inequality only for variances as in eq .",
    "( [ ralph1 ] ) .",
    "ralph and lam s _ best _ classical protocol permits output states completely different from the input states , e.g. , via asymmetric detection where the lack of information in one quadrature leads on average to output states with amplitudes completely different from the input states .",
    "the asymmetric scheme means that alice is _ not _ attempting to gain as much information about the _",
    "quantum state _ as possible , as in an arthurs - kelly measurement @xcite .",
    "the arthurs - kelly measurement , however , is exactly what alice should do in our _ best _ classical protocol , i.e. , classical teleportation .",
    "therefore , our best classical protocol always achieves output states already pretty similar to the input states .",
    "apparently , `` the best '' that can be classically achieved has a different meaning from ralph and lam s point of view and from ours .",
    "then it is no surprise that the classical boundaries differ as well .",
    "apart from these differences , however , ralph and lam s criteria do have something in common with our criterion given by eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) : they also do not satisfy the rigor we require from criteria for quantum teleportation taking into account everything alice and bob can do . by limiting the set of input states to coherent states , we are able to present such a rigorous criterion in the next section .",
    "the rigorous criterion we are looking for to determine the best classical teleportation and to quantify the distinction between classical and quantum teleportation relies on the fidelity @xmath79 , for an arbitrary input state @xmath80 defined by @xcite @xmath81 it is an excellent measure for the similarity between the input and the output state and equals one only if @xmath82 .",
    "now alice and bob know that victor draws his states @xmath80 from a fixed set , but they do not know which particular state is drawn in a single trial . therefore , an average fidelity should be considered @xcite , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the probability of drawing a particular state @xmath80 , and the integral runs over the entire set of input states .",

    "in an asymmetric classical scheme , alice and bob stay far within the classical domain @xmath105 .",
    "the best classical scheme with respect to the fidelity is the symmetric one ( `` classical teleportation '' ) with @xmath106 .",

    "also the output of entanglement swapping can therefore be used for efficient quantum teleportation , succeeding every inverse - bandwidth time .",
