    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices with highly tunable parameters have provided an unique opportunity to simulate strongly correlated phenomena in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of such bose atoms can be described by a bose - hubbard model , and it was predicted that there would be a quantum phase transition from the superfluid to the mott - insulator phase induced by varying the depth of the optical potential @xcite .",
    "recently , this phase transition has been perfectly realized by greiner et al .",
    "@xcite by means of loading @xmath1rb atoms into a three - dimensional optical lattices",
    ". from then on the bose - hubbard model to the cold atomic gas in optical lattices has received extensive studies .",
    "the bose - hubbard model , with on - site interaction and tunnelling between nearest neighbor sites , was used by fisher et .",
    "al @xcite to investigate the bosons in periodic and/or random external potentials .",
    "there exist two types of phases , the superfluid and mott - insulating phases , in this model at an integer lattice filling fraction and zero temperature . in the superfluid phase , the tunnelling term dominates and all atoms occupy the identical extended bloch state .",
    "the ground state of this system can be well described by a macroscopic wave function with long - range phase coherence . in the mott - insulating phase , the interaction dominates and the ground state of the system instead consists of the localized atomic wave function without phase coherence @xcite .",
    "this mott - insulating phase can be characterized by an integer filling factor , the existence of a gap for particle - hole excitation , and zero compressibility . by varying the parameters such as the density and the external potential ,",
    "the system would undergo a quantum phase transition and evolve from the superfluid phase to mott - insulating phase . in the past",
    ", various theoretical approaches have been used to investigate this superfluid / mott - insulator transition at zero temperature such as the strong - coupling expansion @xcite , gutzwiller projection ansatz @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , and other mean - field approximations @xcite . by comparison , there are less studies focusing on the nonzero temperature properties @xcite , and this will be the main topic of this paper .",
    "slave boson technique was developed to deal with the interacting fermion systems for the convenient use of mean - field approximations @xcite .",
    "it has been extended to study the hard - core bosons on a lattice in a functional integral representation by ziegler @xcite , in which there are only two states per site : empty and singly occupations . a similar formulation for interacting boson systems has been obtained by frsard @xcite .",
    "the analytical expression for the mott - insulating lobes was obtained and the density - density correlation function was calculated .",
    "recently , this approach has been adopted by dicherscheid et al .",
    "@xcite to investigate the nonzero temperature behaviors of the ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "these authors showed that the calculated phase diagram at zero temperature agrees well with the results by other mean field methods @xcite and they further depicted the phase diagrams at finite temperatures .",
    "the slave boson and slave fermion approaches are equivalent in principle without any approximation .",
    "however , the difference comes into view if some mean field approximations are made in practical calculations . bearing this in mind , one of us with chui @xcite performed a comparative study between the slave fermion and slave boson approaches under the same mean - field approximation .",
    "it was found that both approaches give the same qualitative phase diagram , but the quantitative behaviors by slave fermion approach are more accurate .",
    "this may be related to the fermi statistics which automatically excludes two same types of slave fermions from occupying the same site when the constraint , one site can be occupied by only one slave particle , is relaxed in the mean field approximation .    in this paper , we will extend the slave particle technique to investigate the various finite temperature properties of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "we will study the finite temperature phase diagram , atom density , superfluid density , and excitation spectrum for various temperatures and system parameters .",
    "the comparison between slave fermion and slave boson approaches will be performed .",
    "we show that although the mean field theory of slave boson gives a qualitatively reasonable phase boundary , the negative coefficient @xmath0 of fourth order term in the landau free energy expansion means that the zero of the derivative of the free energy is a local maximum and thus the slave boson mean field state is not stable , i.e. , the slave boson mean field theory is unable to describe the second order phase transition of the normal liquid / superfluid .",
    "this shortcoming of the slave boson approach does not exist in the slave fermion approach . in this sense , using the slave fermion approach to study the strongly correlated bose atoms may be preponderant .",
