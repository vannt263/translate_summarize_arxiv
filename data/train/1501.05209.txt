    "it is now well known that ballistic phonon transport becomes important in structures with small feature sizes as well as in large structures under rapid transient conditions @xcite . while first principles simulations @xcite , and other physically detailed techniques , have contributed to our understanding of the basic science , there remains a need for simplified thermal transport approaches that capture the essential physics and that are computationally tractable .",
    "a technique that can be derived from the phonon boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) with clearly identified simplifications and that provides reasonable accuracy and excellent computational efficiency all the way from the ballistic to diffusive limits is described in this paper .",
    "traditionally , heat transport has been described by fourier s law with the heat equation ( he ) , but an unphysical implication of this approach is that phonons can travel at infinite speed @xcite . the hyperbolic heat equation ( hhe ) resolves this issue by adding a term to the heat equation that ensures a finite propagation velocity @xcite .",
    "it is generally understood that these approaches are valid only when heat transport is diffusive and the characteristic length scales are much larger than the phonon mfp @xcite .",

    "sophisticated detailed modeling has added much to the fundamental understanding of ballistic effects in phonon transport , but there is also a need for simplified , computationally efficient , but accurate analysis techniques .",
    "several such approaches have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these often follow one ( or both ) of the following strategies : i ) use the phonon bte simplified to obtain solutions for one specific problem , ii ) use a two - channel model to treat ballistic and diffusive phonons separately . our goal in this paper",
    "is to contribute to this work by introducing a technique that combines the physics of the phonon boltzmann equation with the computational efficiency of diffusive equations .    in a recent paper",

    "traditionally , the hhe is solved assuming heat propagates ( in an isotropic material ) at a velocity @xmath144 .",
    "however in the case of mckelvey - shockley ( which can be derived from the phonon bte ) , we find an average propagation velocity of @xmath99 .",
    "lastly , we note that for an isotropic phonon dispersion , we have @xmath145 @xcite , where @xmath134 is the mean - free - path and @xmath90 is the phonon scattering time . using this relation in @xmath129 , we find @xmath146 , indicating that the time required for a phonon to scatter from a forward - moving state to a backward - moving state is @xmath147 larger than the scattering time .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how to use the mckelvey - shockley flux method to treat transient heat transport . by analyzing the transient response of diamond and silicon films",
    ", we demonstrated that this approach _",
    "( i ) _ captures ballistic phonon effects , such as temperature jumps at the boundaries , _ ( ii ) _ finite - velocity heat propagation , and _",
    "( iii ) _ can easily support full phonon dispersions and energy - dependent mfps for detailed modeling .",
    "our results show surprisingly good agreement with the phonon bte , while requiring substantially less computational effort .",
    "interestingly , we found that the mckelvey - shockley flux equations can be rewritten , without approximation , as the cattaneo and hyperbolic heat equations ( hhe ) .",
    "the key to capturing ballistic effects in these diffusive equations is to use the injected heat fluxes as the boundary conditions .",
    "several physical insights are gained : _ ( i ) _ the temperature jumps at the contacts can be simply captured by including a interface resistance equal half the ballistic thermal resistance ( a material property ) .",
    "the origin of the temperature jumps is related to the non - equilibrium nature of ballistic transport , and is not the result of enhanced scattering at the contacts . _",
    "( ii ) _ we demonstrate that at early enough times , phonon transport can approach the ballistic limit in samples of any length , which is relevant for time - resolved thermal experiments . _ ( iii ) _ we show that the hhe is applicable on all length and time scales , which provides an explanation for why diffusion equations work well in situations where ballistic effects are present .    the approach presented in this work is conditioned by two approximations .",
    "we assume a small applied temperature difference , and we use an angle - averaged @xmath0-projected phonon velocity at each energy . the latter results in wave - front transient heat propagation , rather than a smooth one expected in practice due to the wide range of @xmath105 from phonons traveling at all angles .",
    "given that this approach is strongly connected to fundamental physics ( it is just a simple bte derived directly from the full bte ) , it represents a promising framework for analyzing experiments and modeling structures on all length and time scales .",
    "finally , this work suggests that existing heat transfer simulation tools , based on traditional diffusive equations , might be modified to capture ballistic heat transport .",
