    "the inspiral and coalescence of binary black hole systems is a prime target for upcoming gravitational wave detectors such as ligo .",
    "such systems will be circularized by the emission of gravitational waves , and will evolve through a quasi - equilibrium sequence of circular orbits . at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco )",
    "we expect a transition to a dynamically plunging orbit .",
    "it is anticipated that this transition will impart a characteristic signature on the gravitational waveform .",
    "it is therefore important to know the orbital frequency at the isco , since the corresponding gravitational wave frequency is predominantly just twice this frequency .",
    "predicting the waveform in detail from the transition at the isco to the final merger requires the full machinery of numerical relativity .",
    "these calculations require appropriate initial data .",
    "out of the large space of solutions of the initial - value equations of general relativity , we need an algorithm to select solutions corresponding to black holes in quasi - circular orbits . the effective potential method @xcite allows one to construct such solutions , and to determine the properties of the isco .",
    "the effective potential is based on the fact that minimizing the energy of a system yields an equilibrium solution .",
    "this follows from the hamiltonian equations of motion : if the hamiltonian @xmath0 is minimized with respect to a coordinate @xmath1 and a momentum @xmath2 , then @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the energy of two objects in orbit about each other can be lowered by placing the objects at rest at their center of mass . therefore minimizing the energy with respect to all coordinates and momenta",
    "will not yield a circular orbit . to find circular orbits in newtonian gravity",
    ", one can minimize the energy while holding the angular momentum constant .",
    "this procedure works as well for a test - mass orbiting a schwarzschild black hole , where one minimizes the adm energy .",
    "this can be seen as follows . for geodesic motion",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath7 is the energy per unit rest mass of the test - particle as seen from infinity and @xmath8 its orbital angular momentum per unit rest mass .",
    "denote the rest - mass of the test - particle by @xmath9 .",
    "then the adm energy is simply @xmath10 , and minimizing @xmath11 is equivalent to minimizing @xmath7 . hence minimizing the left hand side of ( [ eqn : schwarzschild ] ) with respect to @xmath12 yields the radius of circular orbits as a function of angular momentum .",
    "minimization of ( [ eqn : schwarzschild ] ) with respect to @xmath13 yields @xmath14 , which is necessary for a circular orbit . from the minimum one finds the energy of the test - particle as a function of angular momentum .",
    "obviously , one needs to keep @xmath6 and @xmath9 constant during the minimization , so the prescription to compute circular orbits becomes : minimize @xmath11 while keeping the angular momentum and the rest masses constant .",
    "these ideas have been formalized as variational principles for finding equilibria for rotating and binary stars in newtonian gravity .",
    "there is also a similar variational principle for rotating stars in general relativity @xcite .",
    "binary systems in general relativity are not strictly in equilibrium because they emit gravitational waves",
    ". however , for orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit , the gravitational radiation reaction time scale is much longer than the orbital period .",
    "it is therefore a good approximation to treat the binary as an equilibrium system .    in this paper",
    "we apply this minimization principle to rotating binary black hole systems .",
    "let the masses of the holes be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the spins be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the total angular momentum of the system be @xmath19 .",
    "we exploit the invariance under rescaling of the mass by using dimensionless quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the total mass and @xmath25 the reduced mass .",
    "then we adopt the following straightforward prescription to locate quasi - circular orbits : minimize the scaled adm energy @xmath26 with respect to the separation of the holes , while keeping @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 constant .",
    "it is somewhat involved to carry out this simple prescription .",
    "the computation of the adm energy becomes more difficult than for the schwarzschild example above .",
    "more importantly , however , no rigorous definitions exist for the mass or spin of an individual black hole in a spacetime containing two black holes",
    ". we will address these issues in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] . ultimately , we must use numerical methods to generate and search among the solutions .",
    "our numerical approach involves rootfinding , which is also described in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of the effective potential method . for the interpretation of these results",
    ", we need to search for common apparent horizons in our binary black hole data sets .",
    "these results are included in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , too .",
    "we discuss our results and conclusions in secs .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the appendix contains details of the apparent horizon searches .",
    "in order to minimize the adm energy while keeping @xmath20 , @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 constant , we need a method to compute the adm energy as a function of angular momentum , masses and spins of the holes and separation . as a first step",
    "we construct initial data @xmath27 on a hypersurface as described in @xcite .",
    "our particular approach assumes conformal flatness of the 3-metric @xmath28 , maximal embedding of the hypersurface , as well as inversion symmetry conditions on the 3-metric @xmath28 and on the extrinsic curvature @xmath29 . the effective potential method is independent of these assumptions and works with all methods that compute initial data .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the effective potential method was used without assuming inversion symmetry . in particular , the assumptions of maximal embedding and conformal flatness are not essential but merely convenient ",
    "maximal embedding decouples the hamiltonian and momentum constraints within the initial - data formalism we use , and conformal flatness allows for an analytic solution of the momentum constraints .",
    "one disadvantage of conformal flatness is that kerr black holes do not admit conformally flat 3-metrics , at least for the simple time slicings we are aware of . in @xcite it was shown that the kerr metric is not conformally flat at second order in the spin parameter @xmath30 . indeed , in sec .",
    "[ sec : pn ] we identify this deviation in our results .    because we assume that the initial hypersurface is maximal , the momentum and hamiltonian constraints decouple .",
    "we follow the bowen and york @xcite prescription to solve the momentum constraint analytically .",
    "then we need only solve one three - dimensional quasi - linear elliptic differential equation , the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "it is solved on a so - called ade grid using a multigrid algorithm@xcite .",
    "the constructed data sets depend on several input parameters , namely the radii and the positions of the throats of the holes in the flat background space , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively , and their linear momenta and spins , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we note that in this initial - data prescription , @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the _ physical _ linear and angular momentum of the black hole if it is isolated .",
    "we work in the zero momentum frame , where @xmath38 , and choose @xmath34 perpendicular to @xmath39 in order to realize a circular orbit .",
    "then the magnitude @xmath40 is sufficient to describe the linear momenta .",
    "choosing @xmath41 as the fundamental length scale , we are left with the following dimensionless input parameters : the ratio of the throat radii @xmath42 , the dimensionless background separation @xmath43 , and the dimensionless linear momentum and spins , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath33 , respectively .    from the initial data we can rigorously compute the adm energy @xmath11 , the total angular momentum @xmath19 and the proper separation between the apparent horizons of each hole , @xmath46 .",
    "the total angular momentum is evaluated as in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath47 here @xmath48 represents the point about which the angular momentum is defined ; it drops out immediately because @xmath49 . when orbiting black holes have spin , neither the individual spins of the holes nor their orbital angular momentum @xmath50 are rigorously defined .",
    "we simply take @xmath50 to be defined by @xmath51 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 defining the individual spins .    finally , we need to define the masses of the individual holes . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the mass of each hole via the christoudoulou formula : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the area of the event horizon of the @xmath55 hole . clearly this definition is only rigorous for a stationary spacetime .",
    "moreover , we can not locate the event horizon from the initial data slice alone .",
    "therefore we must resort to using the apparent horizons areas in equations ( [ eqn : m ] ) and ( [ eqn : m_ir ] ) instead .",
    "apparent horizons can be determined from initial data and in the present case their positions are known to coincide with the throats of the holes @xcite . for a stationary spacetime ,",
    "apparent horizons and event horizons coincide , and in a general , well - behaved spacetime , the event horizon must coincide with or lie outside of the apparent horizon . in the latter case",
    "we will underestimate the mass of the black hole by using the apparent horizon area .",
    "some of the results of this work indicate that this happens for very small separations of the holes .    with the individual masses we can finally define the _ effective potential _ as the non - dimensional binding energy of the system : @xmath56 since",
    "the mass - ratio @xmath20 is kept constant during the minimization , minimizing @xmath57 is equivalent to minimizing @xmath26 .",
    "we construct initial data sets starting from the _ input _ parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and compute the _ physical _",
    "parameters @xmath57 , @xmath20 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in order to construct an initial data set with certain physical parameters we have to choose the input parameters appropriately .",
    "this requires nonlinear rootfinding .    within our effective potential approach",
    ", we will search for minima in the binding energy as a function of the separation of the black holes .",
    "fortunately , it is not necessary to solve for a specific proper separation @xmath62 .",
    "it is sufficient to keep @xmath59 constant during rootfinding and thus find a binary black hole configuration with some separation @xmath62 .",

    "are trivially satisfied by @xmath66 . for spinning holes",
    "this is no longer the case .",

    ". therefore @xmath58 must be equal to @xmath74 and we are left with one free parameter , @xmath44 .",

    "one hole is co - rotating with the orbital motion and the other hole is counter - rotating .",
    "the choice @xmath75 would result in holes with slightly different masses .",
    "we thus need two - dimensional rootfinding in @xmath58 and @xmath44 for this case .",

    "figure  [ fig : spin4 ] strongly suggests that @xmath100 is converging to a non - zero value as @xmath60 ( and thus separation ) increase , indicating that there is a contribution to @xmath101 that is independent of the separation of the holes .",

    "therefore the separation - independent contribution must be a non - physical effect due to properties of each _ isolated _ hole .",
    "a likely candidate is the underlying assumption of conformal flatness . at large separations",
    "each hole should resemble a kerr black hole , which is _ not _ conformally flat .",
    "since the kerr metric is the unique stationary state for a spinning black hole , if the conformally flat initial data for a single hole were evolved , the metric would relax to the kerr metric and emit some gravitational radiation .",

    "_ indeed , the common apparent horizons form at a separation inside the inner minimum where the effective potential _ increases _ with decreasing separation .",
    "the search for the onset of common apparent horizons also provides the actual surfaces . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ahshapes ] some apparent horizon surfaces just inside the formation of a common apparent horizon are plotted .",
    "the circles represent the throats of the holes .",
    "the solid lines represent a cut through the plane of orbital motion of the holes , arrows indicating the direction of linear momentum of the holes .",
    "the dashed lines are cuts through the plane perpendicular to the plane of motion and parallel to the spins of the holes .",
    "we find that the apparent horizons lag behind the orbital motion , with the amount of lag being larger for counter - rotating than for co - rotating holes .",
    "we found that the effective potential contours at very small separation _ increase _ with decreasing separation .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual shape of the effective potential for a schwarzschild or a kerr black hole , which tends to @xmath119 at sufficiently small separations .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted in the light of the common apparent horizon searches .",
    "the common apparent horizon that was found to form at a small separation of the holes might influence the observed effective potential as follows : the event horizon must lie outside the apparent horizon . therefore a common event horizon must form before a common apparent horizon forms . to accomplish this the event horizons around the individual holes must grow towards this common event horizon .",
    "thus , even before formation of a common event horizon , the individual event horizons will no longer be close to the individual apparent horizons and the areas of the event horizons of the individual holes must be larger than the areas of their apparent horizons . therefore , equations ( [ eqn : m ] ) and ( [ eqn : m_ir ] ) will _ under_-estimate the mass of the holes .",
    "we denote this underestimate by @xmath120 .",
    "consider the effect this underestimate of @xmath6 has on the binding energy .",
    "the numerator of ( [ eqn : eb ] ) will be _ over_-estimated by a relative amount of @xmath121 at the same time , the denominator of ( [ eqn : eb ] ) and the denominator of the scaled angular momentum ( [ eqn : j_root ] ) change too , leading to an underestimate of the binding energy @xmath57 .",
    "however , the relative changes of these denominators are only of the order of @xmath122 , so that the overestimate from eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : eb2 ] ) dominates .",
    "it might well be that this overestimate is so large that it counter - balances the decreasing effective potential that one might expect in analogy to schwarzschild or kerr black holes .",
    "this idea leads to the following picture to explain the observed effective potential curves : at large separation of the holes , the masses of the holes and the effective potential are reliable and we see an effective potential that looks similar to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "consider , for example , the @xmath95 sequence : for @xmath103 slightly above its isco value we see the ( outer ) minimum of the stable quasi - circular orbit and a maximum corresponding to an unstable circular orbit . as @xmath103 increases , the stable circular orbit moves outwards and the unstable one moves inwards .",
    "once the maximum corresponding to the unstable orbit moves too far in , the @xmath122 contamination of the effective potential `` eats up '' the maximum and it disappears .",
    "now we turn on spin .",
    "we found that a common apparent horizon forms at approximately the same proper separation , independent of the spin of the holes .",
    "it seems reasonable that the @xmath122 error is also weakly dependent on the spin , and also the separation of the holes , where @xmath122 becomes significant . for the  sequences the isco moves to larger separations .",
    "thus the maximum in the effective potential ( the unstable orbit ) will survive for a larger range of separations and angular momenta @xmath103 .",
    "conversely , for the sequences , the isco moves inwards , closer to the separation where @xmath122 becomes significant . the maximum in @xmath57 is lost almost immediately , and in the extreme limit of @xmath123 , it does not show up at all .",
    "this scenario is sufficient to capture the complete behavior of the effective potential as a function of @xmath103 and spin .",
    "what does this picture imply for the validity of our isco results from table  [ tab : isco ] ?",
    "we expect that @xmath122 decays rapidly with increasing separation , so the isco data for the non - rotating sequence @xmath95 as well as for the  sequences should be sound .",
    "however , because @xmath120 changes the characteristic behavior for the  configurations even for @xmath124 , the  sequences will be affected .",
    "let us consider how these changes affect our estimates of circular orbits .",
    "figure  [ fig : toy ] illustrates the effect of the @xmath122 contamination on the effective potential contours . as we noted above , the @xmath122 contaminations of the binding energy overestimates the binding energy of an effective potential contour .",
    "since this error increases as the separation decreases , our estimates for the separation at a given value of angular momentum are also too high , and our estimates of the orbital angular velocity @xmath114 are too low .",
    "unfortunately , we can not determine whether our estimates for the location of the isco are too high or too low .",
    "while our estimates for the separation of a given orbit are too high , we see that the true isco will occur at a larger value of the total angular momentum than we estimate .",
    "these effects oppose each other .",
    "the angular momentum at the isco , @xmath60 , increases with spin for the  configurations .",
    "it is interesting to examine whether the final black hole resulting from a merger of such a spinning binary black hole can violate the kerr limit on spin of a black hole . from ( [ eqn : m ] )",
    "we find @xmath125    by the area theorem , the final irreducible mass must satisfy @xmath126 , where equal mass holes were assumed .",
    "the final angular momentum can not exceed the angular momentum at the isco , @xmath127 . with these two constraints and by virtue of the christoudoulou formula ( [ eqn : m ] ) , we find    @xmath128    a kerr black hole has always @xmath129 with equality in the extreme kerr limit . with data from table  [ tab : isco ] we find for the @xmath130 sequence @xmath131 and for the @xmath112 sequence @xmath132 .",
    "these values correspond to spin parameters of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "hence the merged black hole might be close to the kerr limit , but will not violate it .",
    "the @xmath135 effect illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin4 ] suggests that the assumption of conformal flatness might lead to inaccurate results .",
    "this is particularly important for analysis of gravitational waves . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin4 ] , for spinning holes with @xmath136 the assumption of conformal flatness results in an unphysical gravitational wave content of the order of @xmath137 .",
    "this is less than @xmath138 percent of the total mass and a few percent of the binding energy @xmath102 .",
    "if the gravitational energy radiated away is less than 1% of the total mass , then the gravitational wave content due to an unsuitable initial data slice is a significant contamination .",
    "in this work , we have constructed sequences of quasi - circular orbits for equal - sized , spinning black holes . at large separations ,",
    "the results we have obtained match well with @xmath86-newtonian expansions , although there is a clear contamination of the data because of the assumption of conformal flatness .",
    "the main results of this paper , displayed in table  [ tab : isco ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : isco ] , reveal the behavior of the isco for the cases where the spins of the holes are either both co - rotating ( ) or counter - rotating ( ) with respect to the orbital motion . for co - rotation ,",
    "the isco moves inwards with increasing spin and the orbital angular frequency increases . for counter - rotation",
    "the isco moves outward and the orbital angular frequency decreases .",
    "in fact , we find that the orbital angular frequency changes by almost a factor of 2 between the @xmath130 sequence and the @xmath139 sequence . we have noted a systematic error in our results that has its origins in an underestimation of the mass of each black hole when they are close together .",
    "for the isco , this implies that our results are most accurate ( ignoring the errors due to conformal flatness ) when the holes have large counter - rotating spins , and the error increases as we move to configurations with large co - rotating spins .",
    "in fact , the error becomes so large in the sequences that our method can not locate the isco when @xmath111 .",
    "our results clearly show the need to give up the simplifying assumption of conformal flatness if we are to construct astrophysically realistic black hole initial data .",
    "this is certainly not a new realization , but this is the first time that the effects of the conformal flatness assumption have been seen so clearly in the context of black hole binaries .",
    "work toward more astrophysically realistic initial data has begun @xcite .",
    "this improvement in the initial data is needed for all separations .",
    "it remains to be seen what impact this improvement will have on the process of locating quasi - circular orbits when the holes are close together .",
    "it is likely that the systematic underestimate of the mass will still be significant .",
    "if so , an improved method for locating quasi - circular orbits and the isco will be useful .",
    "we thank larry kidder and mark scheel for helpful discussions .",

    "computations were performed on the ibm sp2 at cornell theory center , and on the wake forest university department of physics ibm sp2 with support from an ibm sur grant .",
    "here we provide details of the apparent horizon ( ah ) finder .",
    "we use the ah finder described in @xcite . the ah surface",
    "is expanded in spherical harmonics up to some order @xmath140 .",
    "the apparent horizon , as a marginally outer trapped surface , has everywhere vanishing expansion and is located by minimizing the square of the expansion over the surface . we use convergence with increasing expansion order @xmath140 to diagnose the formation of a common ah . therefore high expansion orders @xmath140 are needed as well as reliable convergence of the minimization routine to the true minimum of the square of the expansion .",
    "the powell minimization used in @xcite is too slow for high - order expansions .",
    "we replaced it by a dfp method with finite difference approximations of the jacobian @xcite .",
    "for the modest expansion order @xmath141 , dfp is already ten times faster than powell s method .",
    "furthermore , we take advantage of the symmetries of the ah surface . the holes are located along the @xmath142-axis at @xmath143 . their linear momenta point in the @xmath144-direction and",
    "the spins are directed along the @xmath145-axis .",
    "it is straightforward to show that these choices imply that the ah surface is invariant under reflection at the @xmath146-plane , @xmath147 .",
    "this symmetry constrains the coefficients @xmath148 of the expansion in spherical harmonics to be real .",
    "moreover , for the  and   configurations with equal sized holes and equal spin magnitudes , the configuration is symmetric under rotation by @xmath149 around the @xmath150-axis , this is @xmath151 .",
    "both symmetries together force @xmath152 for odd @xmath153 and @xmath148 to be real for even @xmath153 .",
    "hence the number of free parameters in the minimization routine can be reduced by almost a factor of four .    to prevent convergence to spurious local minima ,",
    "it is vital that the function that is minimized be as smooth as possible . therefore we use second order spline interpolation to provide the required data for the ah finder . compared to bicubic interpolation ,",
    "the spline interpolation somewhat decreased the number of iterations needed in the minimization routine , but more importantly it significantly reduced the probability of getting stuck in a local minimum .",
    "in addition , many rays were used to reduce the anisotropies introduced by the discrete position of the rays .",
    "finally , we distribute the rays _ non_-uniformly in solid angle .",
    "the reason for this is simple : the common ah surface will be very oblate along the @xmath142-axis , since it must encompass the two throats located along the @xmath142-axis .",
    "the polar regions of the ah surface are close to the throats and the conformal factor changes rapidly .",
    "these regions are particular important , but the standard distribution uniform in @xmath154 places relatively few rays in the polar regions .",
    "therefore we implemented a procedure that distributes the rays in proportion to an arbitrary ray - density function @xmath155 .",
    "a uniform distribution of rays is represented by @xmath156 , whereas we used @xmath157 , resulting in a doubled density of rays close to the poles .    with the improved ah finder",
    ", we performed extensive tests with various numbers of rays .",
    "as a rule of thumb , about ten times more rays as free minimization parameters are necessary to ensure reliable convergence to the true minimum of the square - sum of the expansion .",
    "we used expansions up to order @xmath158 and up to 64x48 rays ( 64 in @xmath159 direction , 48 in @xmath160 ) .",
    "we perform a set of ah searches , starting at @xmath161 and increasing @xmath140 by @xmath162 between searches .",
    "the result of the previous search is used as the initial guess for the next higher expansion order .",
    "such a set of expansions from @xmath161 to @xmath158 takes typically about 2 hours cpu time on a rs6000 processor .",
    "a disadvantage of an ah finder based on a minimization routine is that the minimization routine will _",
    "always _ find a minimum .",
    "it does not matter whether there actually is a `` true '' apparent horizon , or whether there is only a surface with small but non - zero expansion . and even for a true ah , the result of the minimization will be non - zero because of the finite grid resolution in the underlying elliptic solver and finite expansion order in spherical harmonics .",
    "therefore we need a method to discern a `` true '' ah from a mere minimum in the square of the expansion .    for a true ah ,",
    "the square of the expansion is exactly zero , therefore we expect that the residual of the minimization tends to zero as the resolution of the elliptic solver and the expansion order @xmath140 are increased",
    ". with increasing @xmath140 , the error in the approximation of the surface by spherical harmonics should decrease _",
    "exponentially_. on the other hand , for a mere minimum in the expansion , we expect that the residual of the minimization tends towards a _ non - zero _ limit as the resolution of the elliptic solver and the expansion order @xmath140 is increased .",
    "we use this signature to discern the formation of a common apparent horizon .",
    "figure  [ fig : ahconv ] shows the residual of the minimization for various values of @xmath140 and different separations @xmath59 .",
    "the solid lines represent configurations at different separations of the holes .",
    "they are labeled by the background separation of the holes , @xmath59 .",
    "each solid line represents a set of minimizations with varying expansion order @xmath163 on the _ same _ initial data set . at large separations , @xmath164 , the residual of the minimization becomes independent of @xmath140 for large @xmath140 . at small separation , @xmath165 , the residual decreases exponentially through all computed expansion orders up to @xmath158  a common",
    "ah has formed .",
    "neither reducing the number of rays , nor decreasing the resolution of the hamiltonian solver changes the convergence behavior significantly .",
    "this is illustrated by some examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : ahconv ] .",
    "we conclude that for this particular example a common ah first forms between @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "expansions to high order in @xmath140 are essential for discerning the formation of a common ah . if one had fig .",
    "[ fig : ahconv ] only up to expansions up to @xmath167 , it would be impossible to decide where the common ah first forms .",
