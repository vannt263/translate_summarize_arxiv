    "distant ( ) , isolated early - type galaxies have been studied extensively at optical and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the optical luminosities of early - type galaxies with rest - frame red - sequence colors have faded by @xmath51  magnitude since @xmath8 ( e.g. , bell 2004a ; mcintosh 2005 ; treu 2005 , 2006 ; van  der  wel 2005 ) . furthermore",
    ", little star - formation activity is observed within these galaxies out to at least @xmath0 ( e.g. , bell 2005 ) indicating that this observed evolution is consistent with the passive aging of old stars .",
    "however , the luminosity density of red - sequence galaxies has been observed to remain approximately constant over ( e.g. , bell 2004a ; faber 2006 ) , and since these galaxies appear to be fading passively with cosmic time , this suggests that an important fraction ( @xmath51/2 ) of the current @xmath9 stellar - mass content of the early - type galaxy population has emerged since @xmath10 .",
    "one explanation for these observations is that relatively young , lower - mass galaxies continuously populate the red - sequence ( e.g. , van  der  wel 2004 ; thomas 2005 ) through either a downsizing mass - assembly scenario ( e.g. , cowie 1996 ; bundy 2005 ; cimatti 2006 ; de  lucia 2006 ; lee 2006 ) and/or a scenario where lower - mass early - type galaxies have different merging histories than their higher - mass counterparts ( e.g. , khochfar & burkert  2003 ) . at @xmath11 ,",
    "distant red galaxies ( drgs ; selected using @xmath12 colors ) and extremely red objects ( eros ; @xmath13 or @xmath14 selected ) , some of which are likely progenitors to early - type galaxies , appear to have large star - formation rates and inferred dynamical masses similar to those observed for massive local ellipticals ( e.g. , frster  schreiber 2004 ; mccarthy 2004 ; van  dokkum 2004 ; papovich 2006 ) .",
    "these analyses suggest that the majority of the stellar mass within many massive early - type galaxies formed at @xmath15 , possibly during a dust - obscured far - infrared - luminous phase ( e.g. , chapman 2005 ; swinbank 2006 ) .",
    "x - ray investigations of local early - type galaxies have revealed that the total  luminosity is correlated with optical luminosity ( e.g. , trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ; canizares 1987 ; brown & bregman 1998 ; osullivan 2001 ; ellis & osullivan 2006 ) .",
    "emission from local early - type galaxies originates primarily from a combination of hot interstellar gas and low mass  binaries ( lmxbs ) , and due to their relatively low star - formation rates ( sfrs ) per unit stellar mass ( typically sfr/@xmath16@xmath17  gyr@xmath18 for @xmath19  0.00.7 galaxies with @xmath20  ; e.g. , feulner 2006 ) , these galaxies are expected to have negligible contributions from high mass  binaries ( hmxbs ; e.g. , grimm 2002 ) .",
    "two fairly distinct classes of early - type galaxies , which can be divided by optical luminosity at , have been identified .",
    "early - type galaxies with @xmath21 are referred to as `` optically luminous '' and those with @xmath22 are referred to as `` optically faint . ''",
    "optically luminous early - type galaxies in the local universe are generally observed to have  emission powered largely by hot ( ) interstellar gas at soft ( ) energies and lmxbs at hard ( )  energies ( e.g. , matsumoto 1997 ) .",
    "figure  1a illustrates the  spectrum of ngc  1600 ( sivakoff 2004 ) , a representative optically luminous early - type galaxy ; the hot - gas and lmxb components have been separated for illustrative purposes .",
    "the luminosities for optically luminous early - type galaxies are correlated with their optical luminosities following  @xmath23 .",
    "stellar winds generate the gas and high - velocity interactions and type  ia supernovae heat it to  temperatures ( e.g. , sarazin 1997 ) .",
    "galaxies with larger stellar masses and deeper gravitational potential wells generally have higher stellar velocity dispersions and thus provide more significant heating of the gas .",
    "therefore , the relation is manifested as a result of proportionalities between the stellar mass in a particular galaxy ( traced by @xmath24 ) and the stellar velocity dispersion of that galaxy ( traced by ; e.g. , mahdavi & geller 2001 ) .",
    "optically faint early - type galaxies in the local universe have soft emission characterized by a power - law ( ) component from lmxbs and a mild contribution from hot interstellar gas ( i.e. , a thermal plasma with @xmath25  kev ) . at hard  energies ,",
    "the emission is completely dominated by lmxbs .",
    "the total  luminosities of optically faint early - type galaxies are observed to be linearly correlated with their optical luminosities ( i.e. ,  @xmath26 ) .",
    "this linear correlation is thought to arise largely as a result of the number of lmxbs in a given galaxy being proportional to the stellar mass within that galaxy ( e.g. , gilfanov 2004 ) . due to their low luminosities",
    ", few optically faint early - type galaxies have been studied in detail in the  band , and the presently available data for these galaxies are plagued by large scatter due to small numbers of lmxbs per galaxy and varying contributions from hot interstellar gas ( e.g. , david 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , much of what is known about lmxbs in these galaxies comes from studying optically luminous early - type galaxies that have little contamination from hot interstellar gas ( i.e. ,  faint early - type galaxies ) .",
    "figure  1b shows the  spectrum of ngc  4697 ( e.g. , sarazin 2001 ) , an  faint ( yet optically luminous ) early - type galaxy , which is expected to be representative of the typical optically faint early - type galaxy  spectrum .",
    "the two early - type galaxy classes discussed above ( optically luminous and faint ) generally differ in their relative spectral contributions from hot interstellar gas and lmxbs .",
    "an important component of the  emission from early - type galaxies , most notably in optically luminous sources , is the hot interstellar gas .",
    "detailed observations of the gas have shown that it radiates strongly but does not appear to be cooling as expected ( e.g. , xu 2002 ; @xmath27  7.1 of mathews & brighenti 2003 and references therein ; tamura 2003 ; bregman 2005 ) .",
    "the observed gas temperatures and densities of the central regions of optically luminous early - type galaxies ( e.g. , fukazawa 2006 ) imply short radiative cooling times of @xmath5@xmath28  yr on average .",
    "simple cooling - flow models , which include heating from stellar winds and type  ia supernovae , vastly overpredict the amount of cooled gas observed in the central regions of these galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xmath27  8 of mathews & brighenti 2003 ) ; this suggests some additional form of heating must be present",
    ". attempts to mitigate this problem by including additional heating components in these models , such as transient heating from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , have been unsuccessful in reproducing the observed properties of the gas ( e.g. , the radial profiles of electron temperature , density , and metallicity ; see , e.g. , brighenti & mathews 2003 ) . despite these modelling difficulties , both observational and theoretical studies",
    "have suggested that energy feedback from transient agns must be important ( e.g. , binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ; brzan 2004 ; best 2005 , 2006 ; churazov 2005 ; di  matteo 2005 ; scannapieco 2005 ; bower 2006 ; brighenti & mathews 2006 ; croton 2006 ; hopkins 2006 ; mcnamara 2006 ) ; these studies maintain that agn feedback plays a crucial role in regulating the growth of early - type galaxies and their central supermassive black holes .",
    "observations of giant elliptical galaxies in the local universe have revealed significant  cavities filled with radio lobes that are inferred to have been driven by nuclear agn outbursts ( e.g. , churazov 2001 , 2002 ; jones 2002 , 2005 ; forman 2005 ; nulsen 2005a , 2005b ; allen 2006 ) ; these observations suggest significant energy transfer and recurrence timescales much shorter than the average cooling time .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to characterize the evolution of the hot -emitting gas in normal early - type galaxies and to place constraints on the role of feedback by transient agns .",
    "lmxbs provide another important contribution to the  emission from early - type galaxies ( both optically luminous and faint ) , and many investigations have been dedicated to understanding their nature . observations in the optical band , most notably from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) , have shown that many of the lmxbs in early - type galaxies are coincident with globular clusters ( e.g. , sarazin 2003 ) , and the number of lmxbs observed in a given galaxy appears to be linearly correlated with the globular - cluster specific frequency , @xmath29 ( i.e. , the number of globular clusters per unit optical luminosity ; e.g. , white 2002 ; kim & fabbiano  2004 ; irwin  2005 ; juett  2005 ) .",
    "white ( 2002 ) examined several optically luminous , lmxb - dominated early - type galaxies with stellar populations having ages ranging from ( as measured via spectroscopy ) , and found that their luminosity ratios ( @xmath30[lmxb]@xmath31 ) have no dependence on galaxy age ; @xmath30(lmxb)@xmath31 was observed to be linearly proportional to @xmath29 . again using optically luminous early - type galaxies , irwin ( 2005 ) found that details of the relation imply that a significant number of lmxbs were formed in the fields of the early - type galaxies and that the field lmxb contribution to @xmath30(lmxb)@xmath31 is most significant , and even dominates over the globular cluster lmxb emission , for galaxies with smaller values of @xmath29 . in the optically luminous galaxies studied by white ( 2002 ) and",
    "irwin ( 2005 ) @xmath29 is large , and lmxbs are mainly formed in the high - density central regions of globular clusters through tidal interactions between normal stars and either neutron stars or black holes . in optically faint low - mass systems",
    ", however , @xmath29 is typically small ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1998 ) , and it is therefore likely that lmxbs that formed within the galactic fields of these systems dominate @xmath30(lmxb)@xmath31 ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 of irwin 2005 ) ; these lmxbs are thought to have formed via the evolution of primordial binaries on timescales of following a star - formation event ( e.g. , verbunt & van  den  heuvel  1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , if the downsizing mass - assembly scenario discussed above is correct , field lmxbs within optically faint galaxies could evolve significantly over cosmic time , as lmxb populations emerge in the wake of relatively recent bursts of star formation and eventually fade after @xmath51  gyr ( e.g. , ghosh & white 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , another goal of this paper is to measure the properties of normal optically faint early - type galaxies over a significant range of redshift to place constraints on the evolution of the lmxb activity in these systems .      at present , there have been few investigations of the redshift evolution of the  properties of isolated early - type galaxies , which contrasts with the case for late - type galaxies ( e.g. , hornschemeier 2002 ; norman 2004 ; laird 2005 ; kim 2006 ; lehmer 2006 ) . brand ( 2005 )",
    "used  stacking analyses ( see also , e.g. , brandt 2001 ; nandra 2002 ; lehmer 2005a ) to investigate the evolution of optically luminous red galaxies within the botes field of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) over the redshift range .",
    "the  observations used in these analyses were @xmath55  ks in duration ( e.g. , murray 2005 ) and covered an area of @xmath51.4  deg@xmath32 . brand ( 2005 )",
    "found that the average  luminosities of these galaxies mildly increase with redshift , which is primarily due to a rise in agn activity with redshift . due to its relatively large sample size ( 3316 red galaxies ) ,",
    "the brand ( 2005 ) investigation provided useful statistical constraints on the  activity from distant powerful agns ; however , the  sensitivity of this study was too low ( i.e. , the luminosity detection limit was  @xmath33  at @xmath0 ) to distinguish effectively galactic  emission ( i.e. , hot interstellar gas and lmxbs ) from that of luminous agns .",
    "deep  surveys , which utilize long  exposures with or  ( see , e.g. , brandt & hasinger 2005 for a review ) , are required to investigate the  emission from distant `` normal '' ( i.e. , not predominantly powered by luminous agns ) early - type galaxies .",
    "an ideally suited field for such an investigation is the extended  deep field - south ( ) .",
    "the  is a @xmath50.3  deg@xmath32 , multiwavelength survey field composed of the central @xmath51  ms  deep field - south ( cdf - s ; giacconi 2002 ; alexander 2003 ) and four flanking , contiguous @xmath5250  ks  observations ( lehmer 2005b ) .",
    "the sensitivity limits ( for detecting an individual unresolved  point source ) over the  are @xmath5@xmath34  in the most sensitive regions and @xmath5@xmath35  over the majority of the field ; these levels correspond to luminosity detection limits of @xmath5@xmath36 and @xmath5@xmath37  , respectively , at @xmath38 .",
    "such sensitivity limits are sufficient to detect moderately - powerful agns and normal , luminous early - type galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  1600 ; sivakoff 2004 ) out to @xmath39 .",
    "recently , mcintosh ( 2005 ; hereafter , m05 ) isolated a sample of 728 optically selected early - type galaxies within the  from the gems ( galaxy evolution from morphologies and seds ; rix 2004 ) and ( classifying objects by medium - band observations in 17 filters ; wolf 2004 ) surveys , which overlap with @xmath50.23  deg@xmath32 ( @xmath577% ) of the .",
    "the m05 sample spans a redshift range of , and due to its depth and relatively large comoving volume , it is ideal for investigating the evolution of early - type galaxies over the last half of cosmic history . in this paper",
    ", we utilize the m05 sample and a supplementary sample of 64 additional early - type galaxies located within the  ( selected using the same techniques discussed in m05 ) to characterize the redshift evolution of the  properties of early - type galaxies .",
    "our aim is to measure the average  emission , via stacking techniques ( applied to  detected and  undetected sources ) , from distant normal early - type galaxy populations .",
    "we investigate separately the cosmic - time evolution of ( 1 ) the hot interstellar gas content through optically luminous galaxy samples and ( 2 ) the lmxb populations through optically faint galaxy samples .",
    "the galactic column density is @xmath40 for the ( stark 1992 ) .",
    "all of the fluxes and luminosities quoted throughout this paper have been corrected for galactic absorption . unless stated otherwise , we make reference to optical magnitudes using the vega magnitude system .",
    "@xmath41 = 70  , @xmath42 = 0.3 , and @xmath43 = 0.7 are adopted throughout this paper ( e.g. , spergel 2003 ) , which imply a look - back time of 6.3  gyr at @xmath44 .",
    "we started with the m05 sample of 728 , early - type galaxies and a supplementary sample of 64 galaxies within the  field ( i.e. , 792 total galaxies ) , which were selected following the same methods outlined in m05 using the same data .",
    "the total sample was selected using ( 1 ) rest - frame @xmath45 red - sequence colors derived from and ( 2 ) quantitative optical morphologies ( via the srsic indices ; @xmath46 ) as observed from  imaging through gems ( see @xmath27  2.3 of m05 for details ) .",
    "the sample generated using these criteria is representative of the early - type galaxy population as a whole and is highly complete down to the selection limit of @xmath47 .",
    "photometric redshifts for these early - type galaxies were provided by and are used throughout this paper . using secure redshifts from various spectroscopic surveys in the  region ( e.g. , le  fevre 2004 ; szokoly 2004 ; mignoli 2005 ; vanzella 2005 , 2006 ; silverman 2006 ) , which were available for @xmath520% of the m05 sample",

    "the selection of early - type galaxies via these quantitative methods isolates galaxies with visual morphologies ranging from galaxies , and a large majority of these are e / s0 galaxies ( bell 2004b ) .",
    "we note that the  properties of e and s0 galaxies are observed to be similar ( e.g. , forman 1985 ; blanton 2001 ; xu 2005 ) .",
    "our primary goal was to investigate the redshift evolution of the properties of normal early - type galaxies . to achieve this better",
    ", we filtered our original sample to include 539 galaxies within the redshift range .",
    "this range was chosen to optimize our use of the sensitivity to allow for the detection and identification of low - luminosity agns over a broad range of cosmic look - back times ( @xmath49  gyr ) . as discussed in @xmath27  1.3 , the  observations of",
    "the are sufficiently sensitive to detect agns with luminosities over this entire redshift range ( @xmath50 ) . furthermore , given that the luminosities of agn - hosting optically luminous ( @xmath51 ) early - type galaxies in the local universe span  @xmath52  ( mean  @xmath53  ; osullivan 2001 )",
    ", this limit should adequately prevent powerful agns from dominating stacked photon counts ( assuming the agn activity is not widespread ) .",
    "we utilized multiwavelength observations of the  region to obtain a census of the -detected agns and normal galaxies within our sample .",
    "we matched galaxies in our sample to  sources in the catalogs presented in alexander ( 2003)1  ms .",

    ", we required that the optical and  centroids be displaced from each other by less than 1.5 @xmath54 the radius of the  positional error circles ( confidence ) , which are given in each respective  catalog .",
    "we note that investigations of luminous off - nuclear  sources , which may lie outside our matching radius , have shown that there is a dearth of such sources within early - type galaxies ( e.g. , irwin 2004 ; lehmer 2006 ) .",

    "however , as demonstrated in @xmath27  3.4.2 of alexander ( 2003 ) and @xmath27  3.3.2 of lehmer ( 2005b ) , legitimate lower significance sources , detected by running wavdetect at a false - positive probability threshold of , can be isolated by matching with relatively bright optical sources . since the sky surface density of @xmath56 ,",
    "@xmath57 early - type galaxies is relatively low ( @xmath50.65 galaxies arcmin@xmath58 ) , we can effectively use this technique to isolate  sources within our sample .",
    "we estimate that when using wavdetect at a false - positive probability threshold of , we expect @xmath50.5 spurious sources . in total",
    ", we detected 49 early - type galaxies in at least one of the , , or bandpasses .",
    "we used the following criteria to identify candidate agns within our sample :    1 .   _ hard x - ray emission _ :",
    "our best discriminator of obscured ( @xmath59  @xmath40 ) agn activity is the presence of a hard spectrum , which is characterized by a relatively shallow effective spectral slope ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) .",
    "we classified sources that were detected only in the bandpass as potential agn candidates . for sources detected in both the and bandpasses",
    ", we required that the hardness ratio measured using these bandpasses , @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is the _ observed _ count - rate in each respective bandpass ) , be greater than 0.5 ( corresponding to an effective photon index of @xmath60 ) ; these sources would have spectral slopes shallower than those expected for a pure lmxb population ( e.g. , church & baluciska - church 2001 ; irwin 2003 ) .",
    "we found that all sources with detections were classified as agn candidates .",
    "furthermore , there were a few sources that were detected in only the bandpass .",
    "we argue that since these sources were not detected in the bandpass , our most sensitive bandpass , then there must be a significant contribution from the bandpass such that @xmath63 .",
    "these sources were flagged as agn candidates and removed from our stacking analyses . using criterion  1 , we identified a total of 29 agn candidates . 2 .",
    "_ x - ray  to  optical flux ratio _ : spectral hardness is a good indicator of obscured agn activity ; however , powerful unobscured agns with steep spectral slopes ( @xmath64 ) could still be missed if this were our only means for identifying candidate agns .",
    "another useful discriminator of agn activity , which aids in the identification of luminous unobscured agn candidates , is the flux ratio , @xmath65 ( e.g. , maccacaro 1988 ; hornschemeier 2000 ; bauer 2004 ) .",
    "we use the criterion @xmath66 ( see @xmath27  4.1.1 of bauer 2004 for justification ) to identify unobscured agn candidates in our sample ; two candidates , which were not identified by criterion  1 above , were found using this criterion .",
    "we note that 16 out of the 29 agns that satisfied criterion  1 ( @xmath555% ) also satisfied criterion  2 .",
    "_ radio  to  optical flux ratio _ : we used radio maps ( 1.4  ghz ; limiting 1@xmath67 depth of @xmath514@xmath68jy ) from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ; pi : a.  koekemoer ; afonso 2006 ) , which cover the entire  region , to identify additional potential agns .",
    "we matched the positions of radio - detected sources to those of our early - type galaxies using a 20 matching radius and found 18 matches .",
    "of the 18 radio - detected sources in our sample , we find that three are detected in the  bandpass . of the three -detected sources ,",
    "only cxoecdfs was not previously identified as an agn candidate using criteria  1 and 2 ; however , visual inspection of the radio source coincident with cxoecdfs reveals that it has a clear fr  ii radio morphology .",
    "we find that the three agn - like -detected radio sources have relatively large flux ratios , @xmath69/\\nu f_\\nu [ 5000 $ ]  @xmath70)$ ] , as expected for agns ( e.g. , kinney 1996 ) .",
    "out of the remaining 15 radio - detected matches , 13 sources that were not detected in the  bandpass were found to have uncharacteristically high flux ratios for early - type galaxies , @xmath71/\\nu f_\\nu [ 5000 $ ]  @xmath70 ) > -4 $ ] .",
    "these 13 sources were classified as potential agns and were excluded from our stacking analyses described below .",
    "we note that in addition to agns , star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , edge - on dusty galaxies ) that were misclassified as early - type galaxies may also satisfy this criterion ( see , e.g. , fig .  8 of barger 2006 ) ; therefore , this crierion also helps to guard against the inclusion of such sources .    to summarize ,",
    "we have detected 49 early - type galaxies in the band and have identified 32 -detected agn candidates : 29 from criterion 1 , two additional sources from criterion 2 , and one additional source from criterion 3 .",
    "finally , using criterion 3 we identified an additional 13 agn candidates that were not detected in the  band .",
    "therefore , we identified a total of 45 agn candidates from our sample of 539 early - type galaxies .",
    "the remaining 17 -detected sources that we do not classify as agn candidates are considered to be normal early - type galaxies .",
    "these normal galaxies are included in our stacking analyses , and as we discuss in @xmath27  2.2 below , including these galaxies does not significantly affect our results . a more detailed discussion of the  properties of our -detected sources is presented in @xmath27  3.1 below .",
    "we note that the three criteria discussed above may not be completely sufficient to classify all -detected sources that are truly agns as agn candidates ( see , e.g. , peterson 2006 ) .",
    "such a misclassification is possible for low - luminosity agns that are only detected in the more sensitive bandpass , which have emission too weak for an accurate classification .",
    "furthermore , we also expect there to be agns that lie below the  detection threshold that are not identified here .",
    "however , in @xmath27  3.2.2 , we use the agn fraction as a function of  luminosity to argue quantitatively that we do not expect misclassified agns ( detected only in the bandpass ) and low - luminosity agns below the  detection limit to have a serious impact on our results .",
    "a large majority of the normal galaxies in our sample were not detected individually in the deep  observations over the .",
    "we therefore implemented stacking analyses ( see @xmath27  2.2 for a description ) of galaxy samples , which were constructed to cover two optical luminosity ranges in multiple redshift bins .",
    "we first divided the original sample of 539 early - type galaxies by luminosity into optically luminous ( @xmath72  ) and optically faint ( @xmath73  ) samples .",
    "the two luminosity ranges were motivated by the observed physical differences between local early - type galaxies within these two luminosity ranges ( see discussion in @xmath27  1.1 ) and optical completeness limitations of the m05 sample ( i.e. , the @xmath57 completeness limit ) . as mentioned in @xmath27  1.1 and displayed in figure  1 , the optically luminous galaxies have soft spectra dominated by hot interstellar gas , while the optically faint early - type galaxies have  spectra powered mainly by lmxbs with a small contribution from hot interstellar gas .",
    "galaxies from both luminosity classes have hard  emission dominated by lmxbs .",
    "we divided the optically luminous sample into four redshift bins of equal comoving volume ( , , , and ) , and due to optical completeness limitations , we divided our optically faint sample into two redshift bins ( and ) .",
    "although the subtends a relatively small solid angle , we note that each redshift bin has a radial depth that exceeds 500  mpc , which is a factor of @xmath745 times larger than the extent of the largest structures in the universe ( e.g. , springel 2006 ) .",
    "we created histograms of the galaxy luminosity - distance distributions on scales of @xmath5100  mpc and did not observe any dominating density `` spikes . ''",
    "this suggests that our samples are not being significantly affected by cosmic variance .",
    "furthermore , provided the physical properties of field early - type galaxies are not strongly affected by their environments in a systematic way , we suggest that cosmic variance should not affect our results even if present . in figure  2a , we show rest - frame @xmath75-band luminosity , @xmath24 ( in solar units ;  @xmath76  ) , versus redshift for the 539 galaxies ( _ dots _ and _ crosses _ ) that make up our `` general sample '' ; we indicate the divisions of the sample by optical luminosity ( _ shaded regions _ ) and redshift ( _ vertical dotted lines _ ) .",
    "sources highlighted by large circles ( both _ open _ and _ filled _ ) are those that are individually detected in ; the open circles indicate -detected agn candidates , and the filled circles indicate the remaining detected sources , which are classified as normal early - type galaxies .",
    "in addition to the general sample , we have created `` faded samples '' of early - type galaxies .",
    "the faded samples were constructed using the general sample discussed above ; however , we have corrected the rest - frame @xmath75-band luminosities for passive evolution .",
    "these corrections take into account the fact that the optical power output of early - type galaxies has been fading with cosmic time due to stellar evolution ( see @xmath27  1 ) .",
    "for each galaxy , we have computed an evolved , @xmath9 @xmath75-band luminosity ( @xmath77 ) following the best - fit optical - size - dependent solutions for optical fading presented in tables  1 and 2 of m05 .",

    "we note that even at @xmath187 our model agrees reasonably well with observations .    in order to estimate the amount of agn contamination that may be contributing to our stacked signals , it is desirable to convert the cumulative agn fractions to differential forms ( i.e. , the fraction of galaxies harboring agns within discrete  luminosity bins ) . using the model for @xmath120",
    "presented above , we estimated the fractions of galaxies harboring an agn within luminosity bins of width @xmath189 for each of our optically luminous faded samples ; we refer to these as differential agn fractions , @xmath190 .",
    "the histograms in figure  12b show our estimates of @xmath190 .",
    "due to the deep coverage in the  region , a large fraction of the luminous agns ( @xmath191  ) would have been removed from our samples before stacking ( see @xmath27  2.1.1 ) .",

    ", we show @xmath193 as a function of @xmath194 . using @xmath193 , we computed the approximate agn contamination with the following summation :    @xmath195    where the summation is over all bins of @xmath196 .",
    "we find @xmath197  for our samples .",
    "for our samples with @xmath198 , agns with @xmath199  contribute @xmath7470% of the total @xmath200 estimate .",
    "furthermore , when extrapolating our model for @xmath120 down to much lower values of @xmath121 , we find no significant difference in our estimates of @xmath201 .",
    "we note that this result is mildly dependent on our extrapolation of @xmath120 to values of @xmath202  . if there exists a large population of radiatively - inefficient low - luminosity agns in early - type galaxies that radiate within this  luminosity range ( e.g. , advection - dominated accretion flows [ adafs ] ) , then we may be underestimating @xmath201 .",
    "however ,  observations of @xmath550 early - type galaxies in the local universe have revealed that the majority of the central supermassive black holes in these galaxies are radiating at extremely low efficiencies and typically have observed @xmath203  ( e.g. , loewenstein 2001 ; david 2005 ; pellegrini  2005 ) . therefore a change in the shape of @xmath120 at @xmath204  is not expected .",
    "we converted @xmath201 to a luminosity assuming a power - law model with an effective photon index @xmath205 , which was determined by stacking all 24 agn candidates in our optically luminous faded sample ; in this calculation we purposely made no attempt to correct for intrinsic absorption .",
    "for these 24 agn candidates , we find that the mean band ratio @xmath206 , which corresponds to an effective photon index of @xmath207 ; this effective photon index is in agreement with the effective photon indices measured for sources in the  deep field - north (; see fig .  14 of alexander 2003 ) with similar fluxes .",
    "if we assume @xmath208 is a characteristic effective photon index for the agns we expect to be missing , then we find that agn contamination can account for @xmath54% and @xmath511% of the observed emission from our optically luminous faded samples at @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively ; this amount does not significantly affect the results presented in @xmath27  3.2.1 above .",
    "we note that the  sed used in this calculation has an important effect on the overall estimate of the agn contamination .",
    "since our estimate for contamination decreases as @xmath211 decreases , the amount of contamination in our samples may be affected if our choice of @xmath205 is too flat . however , if we choose a steeper effective photon index such as @xmath212 ( the observed spectrum of the  background ) , we still find that the estimated agn contribution to our signal is too low ( @xmath9125% at @xmath213 ) to make a substantive difference to our results .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in @xmath27  2.1.1 , we have taken additional precautions to eliminate several agn candidates that were not detected in the bandpass ; these sources would not be taken into account in this estimate for agn contamination .",
    "we also note that similar results are found when performing the above analyses using our optically luminous general samples .    due to poor statistical constraints on agn activity in optically faint early - type galaxies , an estimate of @xmath120",
    "could not be determined reliably using the present data .",
    "studies of the agn fraction as a function of galactic stellar mass have found that agns are much more commonly observed in massive galaxies than lower - mass galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann 2003 ) .",
    "we therefore approximated a strict upper limit to the agn contribution to the emission from our optically faint early - type samples by using the same model for @xmath120 presented above for the more massive optically luminous galaxies . using this model",
    ", we estimate that agns contribute @xmath214  20% and @xmath214  40% of the  emission from our optically faint samples ( both general and faded ) assuming @xmath215 and @xmath212 , respectively .",
    "these limits slightly reduce the significance of the quoted evolution for our optically faint faded samples such that @xmath216 is estimated to be [ @xmath217 and @xmath218 \\times ( l_{\\rm x}/l_{b})_{z=0}$ ] for @xmath215 and @xmath212 , respectively ; however , we note that these limits should be regarded as very conservative .",
    "the above results suggest differing evolutionary histories for optically luminous and faint early - type galaxies . as shown in @xmath27  3.2.2 , our results are not expected to be significantly affected by an undetected population of agns .",
    "therefore , changes in the  emission with redshift are likely the result of global changes in the emission from hot interstellar gas and/or lmxbs . in the sections below ,",
    "we discuss possible interpretations of the results for our optically luminous and faint early - type galaxies in turn .      as discussed in @xmath27  2.2 , we chose the sb for our stacking analyses to sample directly the  emission from hot interstellar gas .",
    "therefore , the near constancy of @xmath152 with redshift can be largely explained as a general balance between the energy losses from the hot gas ( @xmath219 ) and the energy deposition from heating mechanisms ( @xmath220 ) over each cooling time , @xmath221 .",
    "here we investigate the relative contributions from feedback mechanisms to constrain physical models of the heating of the hot gas in early - type galaxies .",
    "as noted in @xmath27  1.2 , the typical inferred radiative cooling time for the central regions of an optically luminous early - type galaxy is @xmath222  yr .",
    "since each of our optically luminous early - type galaxy redshift bins are larger than the cooling timescale ( i.e. , our redshift bins have temporal widths in the range of ) , we can estimate the redshift - dependent energy components following :    @xmath223    @xmath224    here , @xmath225 is the redshift - dependent globally - averaged power output from the gaseous component of our optically luminous early - type galaxies .",
    "the first two terms of equation  7b represent agn heating from both radiative and mechanical feedback power , respectively .",
    "the radiative feedback power is represented as the product of the average agn luminosity per galaxy ( @xmath226 ) , its bolometric correction factor ( @xmath227 ; e.g. , marconi 2004 ; barger 2005 ) , and the efficiency factor describing the coupling between radiation and the hot interstellar gas ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "we note that in cases where the compton temperature of the agn sed falls below the temperature of the hot interstellar gas , radiation from the central agn may effectively cool the gas and thereby drive @xmath228 to negative values ( see , e.g. , @xmath27  6 of nulsen & fabian 2000 ; ciotti & ostriker 2001 ) .",
    "mechanical power ( e.g. , through agn jets ) is likely to be a very important feedback mechanism , and we have indicated its contribution as @xmath229 . finally , @xmath230 represents additional energy input from alternative forms of heating over each cooling time ( see below ) .    using the hot - gas component of the  sed for ngc  1600",

    "we measured @xmath226 using our redshift - dependent model for the differential fraction , @xmath190 , which was presented in @xmath27  3.2.2 ( see also fig .",
    "duty cycles for agn activity in any given galaxy are expected to be shorter than the timescales represented by each of our redshift bins ; however , since we are considering large populations of early - type galaxies , we do not expect significant variations in the agn fraction ( as measured from the `` snapshot '' ) at any given time within each redshift bin . therefore using this model",
    ", we can calculate @xmath226 following :    @xmath233    where the summation is over bins of @xmath234 and covers the luminosity range @xmath235  .",

    "for comparison , we also show stacking results from the brand ( 2005 ) samples of early - type galaxies ( _ open diamonds _ ) , which have mean @xmath116-band absolute magnitudes that are well matched to those of our optically luminous faded samples ; these mean luminosities are dominated by  emission from agns and therefore provide a good estimate of @xmath238 ( @xmath58090% of the emission is from agns ) . using these data and our model for the evolution of the  emission from transient agns , @xmath239",
    ", we found @xmath240  ( see the _ dotted curve _ in fig .",
    "13 ) .    using the above relations and the assumption that @xmath241 , we arrive at the following relation :    @xmath242    as discussed in @xmath27  1.2 , transient agn feedback is expected to play a significant role in the heating of the hot interstellar gas .",
    "if we assume that agn feedback is largely responsible for keeping the gas hot , then we can neglect the last term of equation  9 ( i.e. , @xmath243 ) .",
    "with this assumption and the observed constancy of @xmath244 with redshift , we infer that the strongly - evolving radiative power must be poorly coupled to the hot interstellar gas , such that @xmath245 .",
    "this suggests that mechanical agn power ( i.e. , @xmath246 ) dominates the feedback over the redshift range @xmath19 and does not evolve in the same way as the radiative power .",
    "we note that it is also possible that @xmath247 may play some non - negligible role in the heating of the hot gas .",
    "additional heating sources may include inward thermal conduction from the large reservoirs of hot gas found in the outer regions of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , narayan & medvedev 2001 ; brighenti & mathews 2003 ) , type  ia supernovae and stellar winds ( e.g. , loewenstein & mathews 1987 , 1991 ) , and infalling circumgalactic gas ( e.g. , brighenti & mathews 1998 ) ; however , the influence of these heating sources is presently not well constrained .      for our optically faint early - type galaxy samples",
    ", we found suggestive evidence for redshift evolution in @xmath7 over the redshift range @xmath124  0.00.5 ( see @xmath27  3.2.1 and figs .",
    "10 and 11 ) .",
    "although some of the observed emission may be due to agn activity ( @xmath27  3.2.2 ) , there remains suggestive evidence that normal  activity is evolving with redshift , and we discuss possible scenarios explaining this evolution below .",
    "one possible driver of @xmath7 evolution may come from global changes in the lmxb populations within optically faint early - type galaxies . as discussed in @xmath27  1.2 , lmxbs from primordial binaries within the galactic field",
    "are expected to dominate the overall lmxb emission from optically faint early - type galaxies ; this differs from the lmxb emission from optically luminous early - type galaxies , which originates primarily from globular clusters .",
    "lmxbs from primordial binaries emerge in the wake of star - formation epochs @xmath5110  gyr following a major star - formation event .",
    "therefore , changes in the mean early - type galaxy stellar age with redshift should result in observed changes in the mean  emission from these systems .",
    "furthermore , these changes are expected to be most conspicuous @xmath51  gyr after major star - formation events ( e.g. , white & ghosh  1998 ; ghosh & white  2001 ) .",
    "galaxy formation scenarios that favor a more recent emergence of the optically faint early - type galaxy population onto the red - sequence such as downsizing or mass - dependent merging histories ( see discussion and references in @xmath27  1 ) would predict significant evolution of the lmxb emission from these systems .    a second source of evolution of the  emission from optically faint early - type galaxies",
    "could in principle come from cooling of the hot -emitting gas .",
    "however , studies of optically faint early - type galaxies in the local universe have shown that the hot gas emission generally makes up a minority fraction ( typically @xmath540% ) of the total  emission ( e.g. , david 2006 ) and is therefore less likely to be completely responsible for the observed evolution than lmxbs .",
    "understanding the evolution of the  properties of early - type galaxies could be greatly improved by ( 1 ) constraining better the properties of local optically faint early - type galaxies and making a census of their agn populations , ( 2 ) performing additional investigations using other deep  fields that have complementary  coverage , and ( 3 ) conducting deeper observations using  or future missions .",
    "these possibilities are discussed in more detail below .    in figure  8 , we showed the values of  and @xmath24 for local early - type galaxies from the os01 sample , which is the largest , uniformly - selected sample available for studying the correlations of local early - type galaxies . the majority ( @xmath575% ) of the isolated optically faint early - type galaxies have only  upper limits , which has restricted our interpretation of the redshift evolution of these galaxies .",
    "new observations of the galaxies having only  upper limits could not only improve the characterization of the @xmath24 correlation at lower @xmath24 , but could also provide useful insight into the role of hot interstellar gas and lmxbs within the galactic field , which are presently not well constrained .",
    "furthermore , stacking analyses of well - chosen samples of these galaxies could provide useful statistical insight into the mean  properties of these galaxies and mitigate the effects of poor source statistics for individual galaxies .    stacking analyses using additional samples of early - type galaxies",
    "could effectively reduce the sizes of the errors on mean quantities and/or allow for the analyses of samples in more finely partitioned bins of redshift and optical luminosity .",
    "an important requirement for such studies is to obtain an adequate census of the underlying agn population , which may significantly influence the stacking results . in order to remove effectively agns from stacked signals at @xmath50 , relatively deep  observations are necessary .",
    "using the luminosity - dependent agn fractions determined in @xmath27  3.2.2 , we suggest that agns will provide significant contamination for  exposures of @xmath91100  ks .",
    "therefore , studies of distant early - type galaxies using multiwavelength data ( including  coverage ) from already existing  fields such as the @xmath52  ms  or the @xmath5200  ks all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ; nandra 2005 ; davis 2006 ) would improve the present situation .",
    "finally , deeper  observations of already existing fields ( most notably the ) would provide an improved census of the low - to - moderate luminosity agn population at higher redshifts and connect the  properties of these relatively passive early - type populations with those of their higher redshift progenitors ( e.g. , drgs , eros , and distant submillimeter - emitting galaxies ; e.g. , alexander 2005 ) .",
    "in addition to the improvement that additional  observations could provide , it is also worth noting that future  missions such as  and should allow the first investigations of the evolution of the normal early - type galaxy  luminosity function with redshift .",
    "using  stacking analyses , we have investigated the  evolution of 539 , @xmath19  0.10.7 early - type galaxies located in the .",
    "these galaxies were selected using a combination of red - sequence colors and srsic indices as a part of the combo-17 and gems surveys ( m05 ) .",
    "we classified our original early - type galaxy sample as the `` general sample '' and generated an additional `` faded sample , '' which was corrected for the passive fading of old stellar populations . using these samples , we analyzed separately optically luminous ( @xmath2  ) and faint ( @xmath3  ) populations , which are expected to have soft spectra dominated by hot interstellar gas and lmxbs , respectively .",
    "our primary goal was to use stacking analyses to measure and constrain the redshift evolution of the average  emission from normal early - type galaxies . to achieve this",
    ", we used a variety of techniques to identify powerful agns , which we removed from our stacking analyses .",
    "our key results are as follows :    1 .",
    "we detected 49 early - type galaxies in the  band and classified 32 of these as agn candidates based on their , optical , and radio properties ( see @xmath27  2.1.1 for details ) ; the remaining 17 -detected sources had multiwavelength properties consistent with normal galaxies .",
    "in addition to the 32 -detected agn candidates , we identified 13 galaxies with agn - like radio  to  optical flux ratios , which we characterized as potential agns .",
    "we found that the majority of the agn candidates were coincident with optically luminous early - type hosts .",
    "the inferred agn fraction for our optically luminous galaxies shows evidence for evolution with redshift in a manner consistent with the @xmath6 evolution expected from other studies of agn evolution .",
    "2 .   when stacking the  counts from our normal optically luminous early - type galaxy samples , we found that the to  optical mean luminosity ratio , @xmath7 , stays roughly constant over the redshift range , which indicates that the -emitting gas has not significantly evolved over the last @xmath56.3  gyr ( i.e. , since @xmath248 ) . using the data available",
    ", we found that @xmath249 = @xmath250 $ ] and @xmath151 \\times ( l_{\\rm x}/l_{b})_{z=0}$ ] for our general and faded samples , respectively .",
    "we interpret the lack of evolution of optically luminous early - type galaxies to be due to an energy balance between the heating and cooling of the hot gas over each cooling time .",
    "when assuming that the heating is largely due to transient agn activity , we found that mechanical feedback dominates the heating out to @xmath0 versus radiative power , which we inferred to be very poorly coupled to the gas .",
    "furthermore , this result suggests that the radiative and mechanical agn power evolve differently with cosmic time .",
    "3 .   for our optically faint early - type galaxy samples",
    ", we found suggestive evidence that @xmath7 increases with redshift .",
    "by @xmath19  0.5 , @xmath7 is measured to be @xmath162 and @xmath163 times larger than that measured at @xmath251 for our general and faded samples , respectively ; however , due to poor statistical constraints on the local relation and the undetected agn population , we could not confidently rule out the null hypothesis .",
    "we hypothesized that evolution of the optically faint early - type galaxy  emission may be due to the evolution of lmxbs in galaxies that have recently joined the red - sequence and/or the cooling of hot gas within these galaxies .",
