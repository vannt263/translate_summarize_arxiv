    "* * since the commissioning of the first large radio interferometers in the 70s and 80s ( such as the vla in the usa and the wsrt ) radio astronomy in the range of large wavelengths has grown dramatically , particularly with the development of more and more extended antenna arrays . in the prospect of the most sensitive radio telescope",
    "ever built , the ska which will be operational in the 2020s , several new generation radio telescopes are being built or planned ( lofar in the netherlands , askap and the murchison widefield array australia , e - merlin in the uk , e - evn based in europe , meerkat in south africa , jvla the united states ) .    as an example , lofar consists of 48 groups of antennas ( stations ) , among which approximately 35,000 elementary antennas are located in the netherlands .",
    "the `` superterp '' , the heart of lofar is a super - station : a cluster of six stations .",
    "eight other stations , totalizing approximately 13,000 antennas are located in the surrounding countries . a project of a new super - station in nanay ( f ) is under consideration . within each station , antennas form a phased array which allows for digital beamforming simultaneously in several directions and frequency bands .",
    "the beam - formed data from the stations are centralized at the university of groningen in the netherlands where a supercomputer is responsible for the combination of the beam data from all stations .",
    "the resulting data are then stored on a cluster of astron , the netherlands institute for radio astronomy , where the images ( and other deliverables ) are reconstructed . as a mean of comparison ska will totalize 2.5 millions antennas , with a square kilometer collecting area distributed over an area of @xmath0 5,000 km diameter .    beyond specific objectives that distinguish these new fully digital `` software telescopes '' ,",
    "they are all characterized by a great flexibility .",
    "another common point is the amount of data which must be transferred to the central computer and processed .",
    "it amounts to 1  terabit / second for lofar and will be of the order of @xmath1  exabyte / day for ska ( more than 100 times the global internet traffic ) .",
    "lofar uses a 1.5 blue gene / p for the data reduction and the computation of correlations .",
    "ibm et astron will develop by 2024 a supercomputer to process and store 1 petabytes of data everyday @xcite .",
    "this correspondence investigates the possibility to distribute the image reconstruction over the super - stations .",
    "the main objective is to avoid centralization of the sampled electromagnetic fields acquired by all stations in order to reduce the data transfer and the exponential increase in the calibration and computational load .",
    "section ii recalls the basis of radio astronomy with aperture synthesis and proposes a strategy where each super - station uses all its antenna and one reference signal from the other super - stations .",
    "the loss of performances that follows is evaluated on a simple model using the cramr rao lower bound ( crlb ) .",
    "section iii shows that the image reconstruction problem can be written as a global variable consensus problem with regularization .",
    "numerical simulations illustrate the performances of the proposed approach .",
    "a concluding section presents perpectives .",
    "this section provides the basic equations of radio astronomy with multiple sensor array and describes a partial aperture synthesis strategy which aims to reduce data transfer , allowing a decentralized image reconstruction .    to simplify the notations and without loss of generality",
    ", we will not make explicit the wavelengths dependence and the earth rotation and assume punctual antennas .",
    "the coordinates of the stations ( within each station , a beam is created from the phased array ) in a plane perpendicular to the line of sight are denoted as @xmath2 and the map of interest ( the `` image '' of a region of the sky ) is @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the angular coordinates on the sky .",
    "the fundamental equation of interferometry relates the fourier transform of the map to the spatial coherency ( visibility ) of the incoming electromagnetic field .",
    "a measurement of the coherency is obtained by correlating the signal acquired by a pair of stations @xmath5 properly delayed located at @xmath6 and @xmath2 , giving in the noiseless case a point of visibility at spatial frequency @xmath7 : @xmath8 see for example @xcite for a comprehensive description of radio astronomy and signal processing related tools .",
    "computation of @xmath9 obviously requires the transfer of signals from stations @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the same place .",
    "the stations are normally grouped in `` super - stations '' ( e.g. the superterp for lofar ) accounting for low frequencies ( @xmath12 small ) .",
    "resolution is then increased by correlating signals between stations that can be located up to thousands of kilometers from each other .      in general ,",
    "all possible correlations are computed in order to maximize the @xmath13 coverage ( set of @xmath14 ) .",
    "this requires a centralized system architecture .",
    "the resulting visibilities measurements @xmath9 are associated to the filtering of the visibility function @xmath15 by the full aperture ( fa ) spatial transfer function @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the convolution , the weights @xmath18 count the number of beam pairs measuring the same spatial frequency @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the number of different sampled frequencies . the term @xmath21 is associated to `` intra - super - stations '' low - frequency correlations and @xmath22 to high - frequency `` inter - super - stations '' correlations . note that in order to simplify the derivations , we will also denote super - station a single remote station .    in order to reduce the amount of transferred data",
    ", we propose to investigate a solution which consists in :    1 .",
    "exploiting all the low - frequencies by computing locally all the correlations inside each super - station . in this case , the low frequency term associated to the spatial transfer function ( denoted as @xmath23 ) is still @xmath21 .",
    "denote as @xmath24 the set of indices associated to the beams in super - station @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 2 .   recovering the high frequency information by transferring only one single beam signal from each super - station to all other remote super - stations .",
    "if @xmath27 is the index of the reference beam in super - station @xmath25 transferred to the other super - stations , the resulting sampling pattern of visibilities associated to super - stations @xmath25 and @xmath28 is , see fig .",
    "[ parsynth ] : @xmath29    this solution is motivated by the fact that it allows to correctly sample the high frequencies , at the cost of a reduced snr , while reducing the number of transfered electromagnetic signals . other strategies than transferring a single antenna signal are of course possible . a solution which aims to preserve the snr is to replace the signal indexed by @xmath27 by averaging of neighboring beams .",
    "it is important to emphasize that unless the averaging process is taken into account in the measurement equation , the bias introduced by the averaging of nearby beams must be negligible .",
    "this gain in snr will be denoted as @xmath30 in the sequel .",
    "finally , the overall reduced aperture ( ra ) antenna spatial transfer function is : @xmath31 this strategy reduces the transfer of beams data w.r.t . a centralized processing as long as the number of stations inside each super - station is larger than the number of super - stations : for @xmath32 super - stations of @xmath33 stations each , the first requires @xmath34 transfers whereas the second @xmath35 .      in order to evaluate",
    "analytically the loss related to the use of ra synthesis _",
    "w.r.t . _ to a fa we consider a simple one dimensional case where the map is a shifted gaussian shape with flux @xmath36 : @xmath37 the unknown parameters are @xmath38 .",
    "the visibilities are : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a measurement noise assumed independent gaussian circular with @xmath41 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath42 takes into account the variance reduction that occurs when the visibility @xmath43 is estimated from @xmath18 different baselines .",
    "the elements of the fisher information matrix @xmath44 are computed using the slepian - bangs formula @xcite which gives : @xmath45 note that @xmath44 is not a function of the source position @xmath46 .",
    "we compare the crlbs on @xmath36 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 for two spatial transfer functions . in both cases",
    "the aperture configuration consists of two uniform sub - apertures separated by @xmath48 in order to sketch the behaviour of two super - stations : @xmath49 where @xmath50 . in the fa mode , and for @xmath51 : @xmath52    @xmath53 is assumed even , @xmath54 and we consider in the ra mode that @xmath55 : the reference beam is in the middle of the opposite super - station . as noted above , the low frequency term @xmath56 does not change .",
    "the high frequency spatial transfer function is now for @xmath57 : @xmath58 the source width @xmath47 plays a central role in the estimation . for a point source , @xmath59",
    ", high frequency measurements will bring a lot of information while performances for a very extended source ( @xmath60 ) will be independent of the inter - stations visibilities .",
    "[ crlb1 ] and [ crlb2 ] give the results obtained for a configuration defined by @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the source parameters are @xmath64 , @xmath65 and results are given for different values of @xmath47 .",
    "the gain @xmath66 is fixed to @xmath67 .",

    "[ crlb1 ] : the frequency contribution of the source at the inter - station baseline becomes negligible for @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 the order of magnitude of the loss of performances is 4db .",
    "this loss of performance naturally strongly depends on @xmath66 , e.g. when @xmath77 the loss is 13db .",
    "the classical model for the map reconstruction is obtained vectorizing the sampled map @xmath78 and the visibilities @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and reads @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 fourier transform matrix , @xmath84 is a diagonal weighting - matrix including various operations ( calibration , signal to noise weighting ) , and @xmath85 is a @xmath86 binary @xmath87 matrix which codes the sampling of the visibilities in the frequency plane . the noise vector is assumed @xmath88 . with these assumptions , the image restoration problem is usually casted as the general inverse problem : @xmath89 where the regularization term @xmath90 can be for example a sparse analysis @xcite , a sparse synthesis @xcite or a hybrid prior @xcite .    denoting @xmath91",
    "the zero - padded visibilities and @xmath92 the so called `` dirty image '' , ( [ reconstructft ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a ( circulant ) convolution matrix .",
    "using @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 and the inverse problem ( [ centinverseproblem ] ) turns to be equivalent to the deconvolution problem @xmath99    the vector @xmath100 can be partitioned as : @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the vector of visibilities obtained by correlating all the beams inside super - station @xmath25 and vector @xmath103 , @xmath104 , by correlating beams in station @xmath25 with reference beam indexed by @xmath105 in station @xmath28 .",

    "eq  ( [ centinverseproblem ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "using again the property of the zero padding matrix @xmath111 inside each norm in the sum ( [ decentinverseproblem ] ) , we obtain : @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "note that @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    in ( [ decentinverseproblem ] ) , each sub - problem in the sum amounts to reconstruct @xmath116 from the intra - super - station and inter - super - station visibilities @xmath117 . in ( [ decentdeconvproblem ] ) , @xmath118 is a dirty image obtained using only the visibilities @xmath117 and each sub - problem amounts to reconstruct @xmath116 from @xmath118 .",

    "the shape of the sensor array used in the simulations consists of 10 super - stations of 10 stations each , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : array ] .",
    "the stations follow a classical configuration with different rotations .",
    "ten measurements are performed in a range of 3 hours taking into account the earth rotation .",
    "the ra is obtained by computing for each station the correlation with the center beam of the other super - stations and with @xmath67 . for this experiment",

    "the observed dirty images are also reported .",
    "the ra clearly leads to a less detailed dirty image .",
    "the image reconstruction is performed by solving problem ( [ decentdeconvproblem ] ) with a regularized global variable consensus admm algorithm as described in @xcite .",
    "the regularization term is @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "this regularization ensures that the problem is strictly convex and limits the bias . at each iteration",

    "this correspondence investigates a distributed strategy for the image reconstruction problem in radio astronomy when the number of stations inside each super - station is larger than the number of super - stations .",

    "the approach proposed in the paper processes all the data after they have been acquired .",
    "a natural extension is to reconstruct sequentially the image . among the benefits of this setup which perfectly fits the operating mode of interferometers which progressively fill the frequency plane using the earth rotation , is the possibility to optimize in real - time the observation mode .",
    "a straightforward solution is to make a number of iterations of the reconstruction algorithm of section [ sec : image_rec ] after each measurement and using a `` warm start '' . a much more challenging perspective it to select sequentially the frequency measurements used at each iteration .",
