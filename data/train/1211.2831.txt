    "the nature of the mismatch between interacting quantum fields such as qed and the standard model of particle physics and the wightman axioms is not clear , however it appears that the introduction of products of distributions in lagrangian qft is one heart of the difficulty . because lagrangian qft introduces nonlinear interaction terms into the lagrangian without changing the linearity of the underlying hilbert space , we are motivated to consider what similar forms of nonlinearity might be introduced into the wightman or haag - kastler axioms .",
    "real - space renormalization also motivates a nonlinear structure because processes that are used to construct higher - level block variables , such as _ majority rule _ and _ decimation _ , are not in general expressible as weighted averages of lower - level block variables .    the postulate that a wightman field @xmath0 is an operator - valued _ distribution _ ,",

    "this `` born - gns '' linearity is necessary , as in lagrangian qft , so that quantum theory generates probabilities that satisfy the kolmogorov axioms of probability , however the linearity we relinquish has no comparable necessity . in the construction introduced in section [ caalgebra ] , we will be able to preserve the conditions that are satisfied by a wightman field cluster decomposition , relativistic transformation , spectrum , hermiticity , local commutativity , and positive definiteness , and that are required of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to allow the use of the wightman reconstruction theorem to construct a wightman field  @xcite , in forms that are appropriate for nonlinear wightman fields .",

    "is concerned , a reliance on creation and annihilation operators as a starting point seems relatively unimaginative , given the variety of algebras that is available in the mathematical literature , although they seem a good enough first choice , whereas gauge invariance is the obvious further choice ( a first essay at which may be found at the end of appendix [ nonscalar ] ) .",

    "nonlinear wightman field models are apparently adaptable to a wide range of phenomena , comparably to the adaptability of nonlinear differential equations as deterministic models .",
    "the greater flexibility as a starting point for models is a reasonable reflection of the higher order of the mathematics of probabilities over the configuration space of a field theory , and the non - classical description of the evolution of those probability densities over time that is afforded by quantum field theory , compared to the lower order mathematics of the classical dynamics of particles or of a field configuration and momentum .",
