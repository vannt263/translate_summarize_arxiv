    "using the present detection techniques we are unable to define a true nature of the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background .",
    "the status of the grb is now analogous to that of the x - ray backgrund in 1960s and 70s .",
    "although some classes of objects are known @xmath1-ray emitters , it is by no means certain what fraction of the grb is produced by any particular classes of objects and even by the discrete sources in general .",
    "furthermore , it seems likely that some fraction of the diffuse emission considered previously to be of the extragalactic origin is produced in the halo of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite postulate that most if not all of the grb is produced in the galactic halo .",
    "one should expect that structural features of the grb are related to its origin .",
    "it is likely that trully diffuse processes produce the grb of smooth distribution without strong well defined fluctuations . on the contrary",
    ", small scale variations would indicate the discrete nature of the background . in the present paper we concentrate on a class of models which assume that the whole grb is produced by a well defined population of discrete sources .",
    "we discuss two cases in detail .",
    "the source counts are estimated and prospects for the detection of individual sources by the present - day and the near future instruments are assessed .",
    "next we estimate amplitude of the grb fluctuations in various angular scales characteristic to both these models .",
    "it is assumed that the extragalactic @xmath1-ray background is produced by a population of unresolved discrete sources .",
    "we assume further that these sources are distributed randomly , i.e. effects of source clustering on the grb fluctuations are neglected ( it is straightforward to show that for any realistic model of the source clustering the latter assumption is reasonable ) .",
    "since it is not clear which class of sources contributes most to the grb , we consider two types of objects which potentially could generate the grb : _ a ) _ blazars and _ b ) _ starburst galaxies .",
    "blazars are known to be @xmath1-ray emitters ( e.g. @xcite ) , while starburst have been considered as potential sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the low sensitivity and poor angular resolution of the present - day @xmath1-ray telescopes allows only for the detection of the most luminous objects , mostly blazars .",
    "however , the contribution of blazars to the grb remains highly uncertain and depends strongly on the cosmic evolution .",
    "the question whether the grb could be produced by the starburst galaxies also can not be answered directly .",
    "locally these objects are much weaker than blazars , but their space density is higher and there are indications that these objects also are subject to the strong cosmic evolution ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the source counts are related to the luminosity function ( lf ) by the formula : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the @xmath1-ray flux and luminosity , respectively , @xmath5 is the evolving with redshift luminosity function and all the symbols have their ususal meaning .",
    "low luminosty limit in the second intergral is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the luminosity distance and @xmath8 is the average energy ( @xmath9 ) spectral index of the @xmath1-ray sources : @xmath10 . in the subsequent calculations data taken from the literature",
    "have been scaled to the hubble constant @xmath11kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 and @xmath13 .      predicted @xmath0 counts of the @xmath1-ray blazars have been calculated using data on the local luminosity function and the luminosity evolution rate of these objects from @xcite .",
    "agns loud in the @xmath1-rays detected by egret have been used .",
    "the local lf shows pronounced flattening at luminosities below @xmath14ergs@xmath12 .",
    "estimates of the luminosity evolution parametrized by a power - law @xmath15 give @xmath16 at redshifts smaller than 2.5 . at higher redshifts",
    "the evolution slows down and in the present calculations we assumed @xmath17 .",
    "although both the lf and the evolution are subject to large uncertainties , the overall shape of the @xmath0 predicted by the model only weakly depends on the particlular choice of parameters .",
    "the counts shown in fig .  [ lognlogs ] are labelled agn. according to the present model counts flatten substantially at fluxes of @xmath18 .",
    "it implies that most of the grb is produced by relatively small number of bright sources .",
    "significantly different predictions concerning the source counts and the structure of the grb are obtained in the model of the @xmath1-ray emission by starburst galaxies proposed by @xcite . in this case",
    "the @xmath1-rays are produced as a result of the inverse compton scattering of the far infrared ( fir ) photons on the cosmic ray electrons .",
    "both cosmic microwave background photons and intrinsic galaxy radiation contribute to the production of @xmath1-rays . since cosmic ray electrons manifest their presence in the galaxy via synchrotron radiation , measurements of radio luminosities of starburst galaxies provide data on the number of these electrons .",
    "consequently , the correlation between the fir and radio luminosities observed for the starburst galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) allows for relatively safe estimates of the @xmath1-ray luminosity of each galaxy and the local volume emissivity of the whole starburst galaxy population ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in fact , the obtained figures are just lower limits for the high energy emission of these objects .",
    "this is because apart from the inverse compton mechanism , one should also take into consideration bremsstrahlung emitted by cosmic ray electrons in the interaction with the galactic gas .",
    "-ray  sources producing the grb .",
    "energy flux of the lower abscissa axis and the photon flux of the upper axis are scaled assuming the average photon index of -2.1 .",
    "the curve labelled agn shows the @xmath0 counts if the grb is dominated by blazars ; curves de and le \" represent counts predicted in the starburst galaxies model with the _ density evolution _ and _ luminosity evolution _ , respectively .",
    "verical line marks typical detection threshold of egret ; source counts which have common envelope line with a slope of @xmath19 produce similar fraction of the grb.[lognlogs ] ]    the fir evolution rate of starburst galaxies is not well determined , but some direct estimates at low redshifts are available ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "various observations provide data on the star formation history covering redshifts up tu @xmath20 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is an agreement that star formation rate ( sfr ) below @xmath21 varies roughly as @xmath22 , and for higher @xmath23 is either stable or smoothly decayes to low levels at @xmath24 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "approximate data on sfr do not constrain strongly our estimates of the evolution of the @xmath1-ray volume emissivity and source counts .",
    "this is because the @xmath1-ray source counts depend strongly on the evolution type of the fir properties of starburst galaxies .",
    "if these objects are subject to the density evolution ( de ) , the normalization of the fir lf increases with redshift , but luminosities on the average do not evolve . in the luminosity evolution",
    "( le ) case , the space concentration of objects is constant while their fir luminosities ( @xmath25 ) increase with redshift .",
    "high energy luminosity of the individual galaxy due to the inverse compton effect is proportional to the total number of cosmic ray electrons and the energy density of fir photons ( e.g. @xcite ) . since production of the cosmic ray electrons",
    "is also related to the @xmath25 ( indirectly via rate of supernova explosions ) , the @xmath1-ray luminosity , @xmath26 , should be proportional roughly to the square of the @xmath25 . a more scrupulous analysis of the relevant correlations between radio luminosity , cosmic ray electron spectrum and strength of the magnetic field , @xmath27 , as well as radio and fir luminosities , and the correlation between the @xmath27 and @xmath25 ( @xcite ) gives the number of electrons proportional to @xmath28 ( @xcite ) , and finally @xmath29 .",
    "thus , in the case of the le of fir luminosity function , we expect a much stronger growth of the @xmath1-ray emissivity by the starburst galaxies than in the de case .",
    "accordingly , the predicted counts for the le model are much steeper . in fig .",
    "[ lognlogs ] curves labelled le and de show the count for both models ( in both cases evolution rate of the fir volume emissivity is the same ) .",
    "@xcite using the egret data above 100mev have estimated the isotropy of the grb by measuring the backgound intensity over the sky ( far from the galactic center and the galactic plane ) .",
    "analysis of 28 regions of approximately 0.26 sr each gave the average flux of @xmath30ph(s@xmath31sr)@xmath12 with the rms scatter between the regions of @xmath32ph(s@xmath31sr)@xmath12 .",
    "the average uncertainty of the measurement for each field was equal to @xmath33ph(s@xmath31sr)@xmath12 .",
    "this apparent concordance implies that the detected fluctuations are consistent with the noise of the egret measurements .",
    "below we estimate amplitude of the grb fluctuations generated in the present models and compare our predictions with the parameters of the integral instruments .",
    "although integrated fluxes of the grb predicted by the agn and starburst le models are similar , the source counts in these two cases are distinctly different .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the threshold sensitivity of egret ( @xmath34 above 100 mev ) .",
    "a number of sources above this threshold have been in fact detcted by egret .",
    "however , these sources produce a small fraction of the total grb . in the starburst le model",
    "most of the grb is produced by sources fainter by several orders of magnitude , while in the agn model the substantial fraction of the grb is generated by sources with @xmath35 , i.e. just an order of magnitude weaker than the egret limit .",
    "thus , with the sensitivity improved by an order of magnitude below the egret threshold , both models would be distinguished directly . since the predicted sensitivities of the main integral instruments , ibis and spi , are comparable to egret ( assuming the average source spectral slope of @xmath36 ) , it is unlikely that dicrete source observations would allow an unambiguous differentaition of both models .",
    "however , one can assess the source counts below the threshold of @xmath37 ( what roughly corresponds to @xmath38 ) using the fluctuation analysis .",
    "the number of sources per steradian producing most of the grb in the agn model is relatively small . in this case fluctuation of the grb resulting from its discrete nature",
    "are substantially larger than in the starburst model .    to illustrate a potential of the grb fluctuation analysis we consider the agn model shown in fig .",
    "[ lognlogs ] .",
    "integrated counts in this case give the grb flux of @xmath39mev/(s@xmath31mevsr ) at 10mev , what amounts approximately to 73% of the actually observed total background .",
    "roughly half of the model flux is produced by sources below the egret detection threshold ( assuming the energy index of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the relative rms fluctuations produced by the poissonian distribution of sources in the 0.26 sr bins are of the order of 5% of the total ( observed ) grb .",
    "however , if we use regions comparable with the spi field of view ( @xmath40sr ) the rms amplitude amounts to 10% and for the ibis fov of @xmath41sr it reaches 15% .",
    "this figure is roughly equal to the signal - to - noise ratio reached in the egret measurements in the @xmath42sr fields .",
    "thus , if the integral instruments give similar s / n , some estimates of the grb fluctuations would become feasible .",
    "numerical results in the above calculations depend strongly on the assumed model parameters .",
    "in particular , if the blazars produce @xmath43% of the grb ( not just @xmath44% , as assumed in the example ) , the amplitude of fluctuations could be substantially larger .",
    "on the other hand , the starburst galaxy model provides more definite results on the amplitude of the grb fluctuations .",
    "the variations of the grb predicted for this latter model are very low and remain invariably below the detection threshold for a wide range of model parameters .",
    "simple , discrete source models of the grb have been constructed to investigate effects of the background anisotropies at different angular scales .",
    "source counts predicted in the balazar and starburst galaxy models are distinctly different .",
    "we have shown that precise measurements of the grb using of the integral detectors would allow to distinguish between these two cases .",
    "isotropic grb would indicate that the large number of faint sources contributes to the grb making the starburst model more likely , while detectable grb fluctuations would point to the blazar model .",
