    "* early universe physics * is the likely source of fluctuations to input into the cosmic structure formation problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "we want to measure the cmb ( and large scale structure ) response to these initial fluctuations .",
    "the goal is the lofty one of peering into the physical mechanism by which the fluctuations were generated , by learning : the statistics of the fluctuations , whether gaussian or non - gaussian ; the mode , whether adiabatic or isocurvature scalar perturbations , and whether there is a significant component in gravitational wave tensor perturbations ; the power spectra for these modes ( albeit over only 3 decades in wavenumber for cmb probes , fig .",
    "[ fig : probes ] , and fewer for large scale structure ( lss ) probes ) .",
    "* fluctuation generation mechanisms : * the contenders are ( 1 ) `` zero point '' oscillations in scalar and tensor fields that must be there in the early universe if quantum mechanics is applicable and ( 2 ) topological defects which may arise in the inevitable phase transitions expected in the early universe .",
    "* inflation : * for quantum oscillations to be important , a period of accelerated expansion seems essential , for then the comoving hubble length @xmath2 shrinks in size , freezing the time - incoherent noise into time - coherent patterns for structure formation .",
    "a major challenge for inflation models is a `` natural '' explanation of why post - inflation fluctuations should be @xmath3 in size , as revealed by cobe and also lss observations .",
    "many many variants of the basic inflation theme have been proposed , sometimes with radically different consequences for the appearance of the cmb sky , which is used in fact to highly constrain the more baroque models . a rank - ordering of inflation possibilities : ( 1 ) adiabatic curvature fluctuations with nearly uniform scalar tilt over the observable range , slightly more power to large scales ( @xmath4 ) than `` scale invariance '' ( @xmath5 ) gives , a predictable nonzero gravity wave contribution with tilt similar to the scalar one , and tiny mean curvature ( @xmath6 ) ; ( 2 ) same as ( 1 ) , but with a tiny gravity wave contribution ; ( 3 ) same as ( 1 ) but with a subdominant isocurvature component of nearly scale invariant tilt ( the case in which isocurvature dominates is ruled out by @xmath7 ) ; ( 4 ) radically broken scale invariance with weak to moderate features ( ramps , mountains , valleys ) in the fluctuation spectrum ( strong ones are largely ruled out by @xmath7 ) ; ( 5 ) radical breaking with non - gaussian features as well ; ( 6 ) `` open '' inflation , with quantum tunneling producing a negatively - curved ( hyperbolic ) space which inflates , but not so much as to flatten the mean curvature ( @xmath8 , not @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ) ; ( 7 ) quantum creation of compact hyperbolic space from `` nothing '' with volume @xmath11 which inflates , with @xmath12 , not @xmath9 , and @xmath13 of order @xmath14 ; ( 8) flat ( @xmath15 ) inflating models which are small tori of scale @xmath13 with @xmath13 a few @xmath2 in size .",
    "it is quite debatable which of the cases beyond ( 2 ) are more or less plausible , with some claims that ( 4 ) is supersymmetry - inspired , others that ( 6 ) is not as improbable as it sounds ( see cohn , these proceedings , for a nice discussion ) .",
    "it is the theorists job to push out the boundaries of the inflation idea and use the data to select what is allowed .",
    "* defects : * gradients in the disordered field energy left by a phase transition are smoothed on the growing scale over which causal communication can occur .",
    "topological knot - like or string - like field configurations disappear slowly enough that they can act as isocurvature seed perturbations to drive the growth of fluctuations in the total mass density .",
    "the inherent nonlinearity of these defects in the field implies many issues can only be answered with numerical simulations , and these are subject to the same computational - size - to - resolution limitations that plague the rest of nonlinear cosmology .",
    "much analytic progress in understanding the basic observable features of defect models is being made and renewed effort is being put into doing large enough simulations to predict cmb anisotropies in both texture and string theories .    *",
    "hydro : * although hydrodynamic and radiative processes are expected to play important roles around collapsed objects and may bias the galaxy distribution relative to the mass , a global role in obscuring the early universe fluctuations by late time generation on large scales now seems unlikely .",
    "( 95% cl ) , constrain the product @xmath16 of filling factor @xmath17 and bubble formation scale @xmath18 , to values too small for a purely hydrodynamic origin . if supernovae were responsible for the blasts , the accompanying presupernova light radiated would have been much in excess of the explosive energy ( more than a hundred - fold ) , leading to much stronger restrictions . ]    * transport : * cosmological radiative transfer is on a firm theoretical footing .",
    "together with a gravity theory and the transport theory for the other fields and particles present ( baryons , hot , warm and cold dark matter , coherent fields , `` dynamical '' cosmological `` constants '' , _ etc . _ ) , we propagate initial fluctuations from the early universe through photon decoupling into the ( very ) weakly nonlinear phase , and predict _ primary anisotropies _ , those calculated using either linear perturbation theory ( for inflation - generated fluctuations ) , or , in the case of defects , linear response theory .",
    "the sources driving their development are listed in the table . *",
    "cosmic parameters : * even simple gaussian inflation - generated fluctuations for structure formation have a large number of early universe parameters we would wish to determine : power spectrum amplitudes at some normalization wavenumber @xmath19 for the modes present , @xmath20 ; `` tilt '' shape functions @xmath21 , usually chosen to be constant or with a logarithmic correction , @xmath22 .",
    "the transport problem is dependent upon physical processes , and hence on physical parameters .",
    "a partial list includes various mean energy densities @xmath23 , the hubble parameter @xmath24 , the number of relativistic neutrinos , the abundance of primordial helium , and parameters characterizing the ionization history of the universe , the compton optical depth from a reheating redshift @xmath25 to the present . for a given model , the early universe power spectrum amplitude measures are uniquely related to late - time power spectrum measures of relevance for the cmb , such as the quadrupole or bandpowers for various experiments , or to large scale structure observations , such as the _ rms _ density fluctuation level on the @xmath26 ( cluster ) scale , @xmath27 .",

    "by @xmath47 , @xmath30 is down to 0.055 at this age .",

    "even the nearly degenerate hot / cold and cdm models shown should be distinguishable by cobras / samba .",
    "* comba : * spurred on by the promise of percent - level precision in cosmic parameters from cmb satellites , a considerable fraction of the cmb theoretical community with boltzmann transport codes compared their approaches and validated the results to ensure percent - level accuracy up to @xmath49 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : clpow ] to @xmath50 figures with tiny vertical range .",
    "we look forward to the happy day when such a relative difference figure will be used to reveal the remaining tiny residuals in the best fit theoretical model .",
    "an important goal for comba was speed , since the parameter space we wish to constrain has many dimensions .",
    "most groups have solved cosmological radiative transport by evolving a hierarchy of coupled moment equations , one for each @xmath42 . although the equations and techniques were in place prior to the cobe discovery for scalar modes , and shortly after for tensor modes , to get the high accuracy with speed has been somewhat of a challenge .",
    "there are alternatives to the moment hierarchy for the transport of photons and neutrinos",
    ". in particular the entire problem of photon transport reduces to integral equations in which the multipoles with @xmath51 are expressed as history - integrals of metric variables , photon - bunching , doppler and polarization sources , as in the table .",
    "the fastest comba - validated code uses this method ( seljak , these proceedings ) .    * secondary : * secondary anisotropies , with sources listed in the table , arise from nonlinear structures .",
    "they are a nuisance foreground to be subtracted to get at the _ primary _ primary ones , but also invaluable probes of shorter - distance aspects of structure formation theories , full of important cosmological information .",
    "the effect of lensing is to smooth slightly the doppler peaks and troughs of fig .",
    "[ fig : clpow ] .",
    "@xmath52 s from quadratic nonlinearities in the gas at high redshift are concentrated at high @xmath42 , but for most viable models are expected to be a small contaminant . scattering from gas in moving clusters also has a small effect on @xmath52 , although is measurable in individual clusters .",

    "[ fig : clpow ] are for a cluster - normalized @xmath27=0.7 hot / cold hybrid model ( solid , @xmath53=0.3 ) and an @xmath29=0.8 tilted cdm model . although @xmath54 may be small , because the power for such non - gaussian sources is concentrated in hot or cold spots the signal is detectable , and often has been .",
    "@xmath52 for a typical dusty primeval galaxy model is also shown , the larger ( arbitrarily normalized ) part a shot - noise effect for galaxies with dust distributed over @xmath55 , the smaller a contribution associated with clustering .",
    "similar spectra are expected for other extragalactic point sources , radio galaxies .",
    "* phenomenology : * we have progressed from the tens of pixels of early @xmath7 experiments through the thousands for dmr and sk , and will soon be dealing with tens of thousands for long duration balloon experiments and eventually millions for the map and cobras / samba satellites .",
    "how best to analyze statistically these data sets is a subject being developed largely by cmb theorists .",
    "theorists have also taken on an increasingly phenomenological role in lss studies and many of the same techniques are being applied to both @xmath7 and lss data sets .",
    "this is opening up into a major subfield , a trend which we should strongly encourage . finding nearly optimal strategies for data projection , compression and analysis which will allow us to disentangle the primary anisotropies from the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and from the secondary anisotropies induced by nonlinear effects will be the key to realizing the theoretically - possible precision on cosmic parameters and so to determine the winner ( and losers ) in theory space .",
    "particularly powerful is to combine results from different cmb experiments and combine these with lss and other observations . almost as important as the end - product is the application of the same techniques to probing the self - consistency and cross - consistency of experimental results .    *",
    "current state : * current band - powers , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clpow ] , broadly follow inflation - based expectations , but may still include residual signals .",
    "consistency with the primary anisotropy frequency spectrum has been shown for dmr and for the smaller angle experiments , but over a limited range . that the level is @xmath3 provides strong support for the gravitational instability theory . to get the large scale structure of cobe - normalized fluctuations",
    "right provides encouraging support that the initial fluctuation spectrum was not far off the scale invariant form that inflation ( and defect ) models prefer . that there appears to be power at @xmath56 suggests the universe could not have reionized too early .",
    "* large scale structure : * we have always combined cmb and lss data in our quest for viable models . fig .  [ fig : probes ] shows how the two are connected .",
    "as we have seen , the dmr data precisely determines @xmath27 for each model considered . for the cobe - normalized density power spectra to thread the `` eye of the needle '' associated with cluster abundances severely constrains the parameters determining them",
    ". similar constrictions arise from galaxy - galaxy and cluster - cluster clustering observations .",
    "smaller angle cmb data ( sp94 , sk95 ) are consistent with these models ( bond and jaffe , these proceedings ) , and will soon be powerful enough for the cmb by itself to offer strong selection , but this will definitely not diminish the combined lss - cmb phenomenology .    *",
    "ultra - large scale structure : * the `` beyond our horizon '' land in fig .",
    "[ fig : probes ] is actually partly accessible because long waves contribute gentle gradients to our observables .",
    "constraints on such `` global parameters '' as average curvature are an example , @xmath57 , though not yet very restrictive .",
    "one may also probe whether a huge bump or deficit in power exists just beyond @xmath58 , but this has not been much explored .",
    "the remarkable non - gaussian structure predicted by stochastic inflation theory would likely be too far beyond our horizon for its influence to be felt .",
    "the bubble boundary in hyperbolic inflation models may be closer and its influence shortly after tunneling occurred could have observable consequences for the cmb .",
    "theorists have also constrained the scale of topology in simple models ; we ( pogosyan , sokolov and i ) find @xmath59 for flat 3-tori and @xmath60 for flat 1-tori from dmr ( see de oliveira - costa , these proceedings ) . a number of groups are now trying to constrain the compact hyperbolic topologies .    * futures : * let us look forward to the day phenomenological theorists will have optimally - analyzed ldbs / vsa / cbi / chispi / map / cobras / samba and we know the power spectrum and cosmic parameters to wonderful precision .",
    "what will it mean ?",
    "it may not be clear .",
    "take inflation as an example .",
    "there will be attempts , undoubtedly optimal ones , to reconstruct the inflaton s potential , but all of our cmb and lss observations actually access only a very small region of the potential surface , and even this will be fuzzily determined if we allow too much freedom in parameter space .",
    "still even a fuzzy glimpse is worth the effort .",
