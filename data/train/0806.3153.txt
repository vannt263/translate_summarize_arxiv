    "projective spaces over rings ( see @xcite for the standard terminology , notation and the necessary background information ) , and projective lines in particular ( see @xcite ) , have recently become the subject of considerable interest due to rather unexpected recognition of their relevance for the field of quantum physics in general and quantum information theory in particular ; we refer to @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "being motivated by these intriguing applications , we have had  in the framework of a broader international collaboration  a detailed look at the structure of a variety of finite projective ring lines and planes ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) and came across some interesting aspects ( see , among others , @xcite ) which , to the best of our knowledge , have not yet been the subject of a systematic mathematical treatment .",
    "these aspects mostly relate to the properties of free cyclic submodules generated by vectors of a free @xmath0-module of a given unital ring @xmath0 , and can be summarised into the following open problems : how the interrelation between different free cyclic submodules over a particular ring is encoded in the structure of the ideals of the ring ; what kind of finite rings feature `` outliers '' , i.e. , vectors not belonging to any free cyclic submodule generated by unimodular vectors ; what the conditions are for a non - unimodular vector to generate a free cyclic submodule ; and , finally , how the substructure generated by such non - unimodular free cyclic submodules relates to the parent ring geometry .",
    "these questions lead to projective lattice geometry in the sense of @xcite . in order to partially answer some of them ,",
    "we have already examined the case of the smallest ring of ternions @xcite  this being , remarkably , the _ lowest _ order ring where one not only finds `` outliers '' , but also free cyclic submodules generated by ( some of ) them . in the present paper we extend and generalise the findings of @xcite to an arbitrary ring of ternions , with finite cases handled in somewhat more detail .",
    "let @xmath2 be a ( commutative ) field .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the ring of _ ternions _ ,",
    "i.e. , _ upper triangular @xmath1 matrices _ over @xmath2 , with the usual addition and multiplication for matrices .",
    "the ring @xmath0 is non - commutative , with @xmath13 ( the @xmath14 identity matrix over @xmath2 ) being its multiplicative identity and 0 ( the @xmath14 zero matrix over @xmath2 ) the additive one . and the zero matrix of @xmath0 , the difference being always fairly obvious from the context . ]",
    "the ring @xmath0 has precisely two ( two - sided ) ideals other than @xmath15 and @xmath0 , namely the sets @xmath16 furthermore , all sets @xmath17 are proper right ideals of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , @xmath18 depends only on the ratio @xmath19 .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath20 is also allowed here .",
    "similarly , all sets @xmath21 are proper left ideals of @xmath0 .",
    "it is an easy exercise to show that there are no other proper one - sided ideals in @xmath0 apart from the ones given by ( [ eq : right2b : c ] ) and ( [ eq : left1a : b ] ) .",
    "recall that the _ jacobson radical _ of @xmath0 ( denoted by @xmath22 ) equals the intersection of all maximal left ( or right ) ideals .",
    "so @xmath23 note that a ternion is invertible ( a unit ) if , and only if , its diagonal entries are non - zero .",
    "the set of invertible ternions will be written as @xmath24 .",
    "it is a group under multiplication .",
    "we consider now the free left @xmath0-module @xmath3 for some integer @xmath25 .",
    "( the assumption @xmath25 is needed , for example , to guarantee that all six cases which appear in the proof of lemma  [ lem : vectors ] below actually occur .",
    "we refrain from discussing the trivial cases @xmath26 and @xmath27 throughout the paper . )",
    "we use boldface letters for vectors and matrices with entries from @xmath0 .",
    "any @xmath28 matrix @xmath29 over @xmath0 can be considered as a @xmath30 matrix over @xmath2 which is partitioned in @xmath1 blocks formed by the upper triangular matrices @xmath31 , and vice versa .",
    "multiplication of matrices over @xmath0 is equivalent to multiplication of matrices over @xmath2 under this one - one correspondence .",
    "thus , in particular , it is easy to check whether a square matrix over @xmath0 is invertible by calculating the determinant of the associated matrix over @xmath2 .",
    "our first aim is to classify the ( row ) vectors of the free left module @xmath3 up to the natural action of the general linear group @xmath7 . given a vector @xmath32 let @xmath33 denote the _ right _ ideal of @xmath0 which is generated by @xmath34 .    [",
    "lem : vectors ] two vectors @xmath35 are in the same @xmath7-orbit if , and only if , the right ideals @xmath33 and @xmath36 coincide .",
    "if a vector @xmath37 is multiplied by a matrix @xmath38 , then the coordinates of @xmath39 belong to @xmath33 . by virtue of the inverse matrix @xmath40 ,",
    "we see that actually @xmath41 .    in order to show the converse , we establish that the orbit of any vector @xmath42 contains a distinguished vector which depends only on the right ideal @xmath33 . in our discussion below we make use of two obvious facts .",
    "firstly , we may permute the coordinates of a vector in an arbitrary way by multiplying it with a permutation matrix . secondly",
    ", if @xmath43 is a non - zero vector with @xmath44 , say , then one of the entries of the ternion @xmath45 is a scalar @xmath46 .",
    "multiplying @xmath43 by the invertible matrix @xmath47 gives a vector @xmath48 such that the entry of the ternion @xmath49 at the same position equals @xmath50 .",
    "so , without loss of generality , we may assume @xmath51 from the very beginning .",
    "@xmath52 , so that @xmath53 is already the distinguished vector .    @xmath54 .",
    "thus @xmath43 has the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , say .",
    "multiplying @xmath43 by the invertible matrix @xmath58 gives the distinguished vector @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 for some @xmath61 .",
    "hence we may assume @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "multiplying @xmath43 by the invertible matrix @xmath65 gives the distinguished vector @xmath66 .",
    "the scalar @xmath67 which appears in this vector depends only on the right ideal @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 , whence at least one coordinate of @xmath43 has to be off the jacobson radical .",
    "so the coordinates of @xmath43 read @xmath70 with @xmath71 , say .",
    "we introduce the shorthand @xmath72 and proceed in two steps as follows : define @xmath73 since @xmath74 , at least one of @xmath75 , say @xmath76 , is unequal to @xmath15 .",
    "now multiplying @xmath77 by the invertible matrix @xmath78 gives the distinguished vector @xmath79 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath81 and @xmath82 , because at least one coordinate of @xmath43 has to be off the jacobson radical .",
    "multiplying @xmath43 by the invertible matrix @xmath83 gives the distinguished vector @xmath84 .",
    "assume , first , that none of the entries of @xmath43 is invertible .",
    "hence we have , for example , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "define @xmath88 then @xmath89 is a unit .",
    "thus , we may restrict ourselves to the case when one of the entries of @xmath43 , say @xmath45 , is a unit .",
    "now , multiplying @xmath43 by the invertible matrix @xmath90 gives the distinguished vector @xmath91 .",
    "the previous proof shows that for @xmath25 the vectors of @xmath3 fall into @xmath92 orbits .",
    "[ lem : points ] under the action of the general linear group @xmath7 , @xmath25 , the cyclic submodules of @xmath3 fall into six orbits with the following representatives :    @xmath93    the assertion follows immediately from the classification of vectors in lemma  [ lem : vectors ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the cyclic submodule given in ( [ eq : cs3 ] ) is generated by any vector @xmath43 with @xmath60 for an _ arbitrary _ @xmath61 .",
    "this illustrates once more that the classification of cyclic submodules is coarser than the classification of vectors .    in the terminology of @xcite the cyclic - generated _ rather than `` cyclic '' .",
    "the latter term has a different meaning there @xcite . ]",
    "submodules of @xmath3 are the _ points _ of the _ projective lattice geometry _ given by @xmath3 . the only _ free points _",
    ", i.e. , free cyclic submodules , appearing in lemma  [ lem : points ] are given in ( [ eq : cs4 ] ) and ( [ eq : cs6 ] ) .",
    "the point in ( [ eq : cs6 ] ) is _ unimodular _ , because there exists an @xmath0-linear form @xmath94 which takes @xmath91 to @xmath95 .",
    "the point in ( [ eq : cs4 ] ) is not unimodular , since none of its vectors is mapped to @xmath96 under an @xmath0-linear form .",
    "we shall not be concerned with the orbits of the remaining points from lemma  [ lem : points ] , since none of them is free .",
    "the orbit of ( [ eq : cs6 ] ) under the action of @xmath7 is thus the set of `` ordinary '' ( i.e. , unimodular free ) points .",
    "note that only the elements of this set are called `` points '' in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "see also the section on barbilian spaces in projective lattice geometries in @xcite .",
    "the orbit of ( [ eq : cs4 ] ) gives rise to the set of `` extraordinary '' ( i.e. , non - unimodular free ) points of the projective lattice geometry associated with @xmath3 .",
    "it is the latter set we shall consider in the sequel , due to its link with the @xmath9-dimensional projective space @xmath97 .",
    "the free @xmath0-left module @xmath3 turns into a @xmath98-dimensional vector space over @xmath2 by restricting the ring of scalars from @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "( we tacitly do not distinguish between @xmath99 and the ternion @xmath100 . )",
    "each @xmath0-submodule of @xmath3 is at the same time an @xmath2-subspace of this vector space . in this section",
    "we focus our attention to the @xmath0-submodule @xmath101 .",
    "there exists an obvious @xmath2-linear bijection between @xmath102 which is given by @xmath103 in the proof of the following result we use this mapping to consider @xmath104 as an underlying vector space for the projective space @xmath105 ) . note that we _ can not _",
    "take @xmath22 ( together with addition and multiplication from @xmath0 ) as the field of scalars for this vector space , but we have to let @xmath2 play this role .    [ thm:1 ] let @xmath0 be the ring of ternions over a field @xmath2 .",
    "the lines of the projective space @xmath106 , @xmath25 , are precisely the intersections of @xmath104 with the non - unimodular free cyclic submodules of the module @xmath3 .    under the action of @xmath7 on @xmath3 the set",
    "@xmath104 is invariant .",
    "consequently , @xmath7 acts as an @xmath2-linear transformation on @xmath104 .",
    "conversely , given an @xmath2-linear bijection of @xmath104 it will correspond , in terms of the coordinates given by ( [ eq : coo ] ) , to a unique matrix @xmath107 .",
    "this matrix over @xmath2 determines the matrix @xmath108 which in turn induces the given transformation on @xmath104 .",
    "thus the @xmath2-linear bijections of @xmath104 are precisely the @xmath0-linear bijections of @xmath3 restricted to @xmath104 .",
    "we add in passing that this action of @xmath7 on @xmath104 is not faithful .",
    "the non - unimodular free cyclic submodule ( [ eq : cs4 ] ) meets @xmath104 in a two - dimensional @xmath2-subspace or , said differently , in a line of @xmath109 ) .",
    "all non - unimodular free cyclic submodules of @xmath3 ( and , likewise , all lines of @xmath105 ) ) form an orbit under the action of the group @xmath7 .",
    "this proves the assertion .",
    "the previous result describes only the _ lines _ of @xmath105 ) as certain subsets of @xmath104 .",
    "however , for @xmath12 this implies that also the _ points _ of this projective space are known : a subset @xmath110 of @xmath104 is a point if , and only if , there exist non - unimodular free cyclic submodules @xmath111 and @xmath112 of @xmath3 such that @xmath113 @xmath114 thus the vectors of @xmath104 together with the `` traces '' of the non - unimodular free cyclic submodules of @xmath3 completely determine the structure of @xmath8 for @xmath12 .",
    "there is yet another approach to points which makes use of unimodular free cyclic submodules .",
    "it works even for @xmath115 : the points of @xmath105 ) are precisely the intersections of @xmath104 with the unimodular free cyclic submodules of the module @xmath3 .",
    "this follows like in the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] from the fact that the meet of the submodule ( [ eq : cs6 ] ) with @xmath104 is a point of @xmath105 ) , and from the actions of @xmath7 on @xmath3 and @xmath104 .",
    "finally , we note that theorem  [ thm:1 ] also furnishes the proof of the validity of the conjecture raised in @xcite about the connection between non - unimodular free cyclic submodules of @xmath116 , where @xmath0 is the ring of ternions over a galois field @xmath10 , and lines of the projective plane @xmath117 .",
    "we assume throughout this section that @xmath2 is a galois field @xmath10 with @xmath118 elements .",
    "so @xmath119 , and the number of units in @xmath0 is given by @xmath120 .",
    "our first aim is to count the numbers @xmath121 of vectors of @xmath3 fitting into cases @xmath122 according to the classification from the previous section .",
    "all of these numbers are non - zero due to our general assumption @xmath115 , which is also adopted in this section .    case  1 : the zero - vector is the only vector arising in this case , whence @xmath123 .    case  2 : there are @xmath124 vectors with entries from the radical of @xmath0 , including the zero - vector .",
    "we obtain therefore @xmath125 .    case  3 : first we consider a fixed @xmath61 .",
    "any vector @xmath43 with @xmath60 has the form @xmath126 with @xmath127 . as @xmath67 varies in @xmath2 , we get @xmath128 .    case  4 : there are @xmath129 vectors with entries from the ideal @xmath130 , including the vectors from cases 1 , 2 , and 3 . hence @xmath131    case  5 : we proceed as before and obtain from @xmath132 that @xmath133    case  6 : all remaining vectors fall into this case .",
    "we read off from @xmath134 that @xmath135    we consider now the set @xmath136 of all vectors of @xmath3 which belong to at least one non - unimodular free cyclic submodule of @xmath3 .",
    "for this set to be non - empty we must have @xmath25 . under these circumstances",
    "the set @xmath136 comprises precisely the @xmath137 vectors fitting into cases 14 according to our classification .",
    "[ thm:2 ] let @xmath0 be the ring of ternions over @xmath10 .",
    "there are precisely @xmath138 non - unimodular free cyclic submodules in @xmath3 for @xmath25 .",
    "the number of such submodules containing a vector @xmath37 equals @xmath139    equation ( [ eq : np : i_1 ] ) holds trivially .",
    "the number of non - unimodular free cyclic submodules is @xmath140 which yields ( [ eq : np ] ) and ( [ eq : np:0 ] ) . in order to establish ( [ eq : np : rad ] ) we count in two ways",
    "the number of pairs @xmath141 , where @xmath112 is a non - unimodular free cyclic submodule and the vector @xmath142 is subject to @xmath54 .",
    "first we fix @xmath143 and count the number of appropriate vectors @xmath43 .",
    "since all vectors @xmath143 with @xmath144 are in one orbit of @xmath7 , it is sufficient to consider as @xmath143 the distinguished vector obtained in case  4 . by ( [ eq : cs4 ] ) ,",
    "the vectors of @xmath112 have the form @xmath145 such a vector has the required properties if , and only if , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "hence there are @xmath148 vectors of this kind .",
    "consequently , as @xmath143 varies also , the number of pairs @xmath141 is equal to @xmath149 counting in a different way , we find that this number equals @xmath150 , whence indeed @xmath151    the proof of ( [ eq : np : i_1(b:1 ) ] ) can be accomplished in the same fashion .",
    "the coordinates of a vector given in ( [ eq : xyz ] ) generate a right ideal @xmath68 for some @xmath61 if , and only if , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the last condition is due to the fact that second ternion coordinate of the vector appearing in ( [ eq : xyz ] ) has to be a scalar multiple of the first one .",
    "hence there are @xmath154 vectors of this kind .",
    "this gives @xmath155 from which the formula for @xmath156 is immediate .",
    "we notice that @xmath157 thus for @xmath12 these numbers are distinct and all of them are greater than @xmath158 . under these circumstances",
    "the four types of vectors in @xmath136 can be distinguished by the _ number of non - unimodular free cyclic submodules in which they are contained_. consequently , the set @xmath136 and the family of non - unimodular free cyclic submodules determine the lines and points of the projective space @xmath11 according to theorem  [ thm:1 ] and the subsequent remarks .",
    "this provides now the theoretical background for the _ fano - snowflake _ from @xcite , which is depicted in figure  [ fig : snowflake ] , and puts the construction from there in a general context by allowing an arbitrary dimension @xmath12 and any prime power @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath159 vectors of @xmath160 are represented by circles , whose sizes reflect the number of non - unimodular free cyclic submodules of @xmath161 they are contained in . as the zero vector is not shown , each submodule of this kind is represented by @xmath162 circles lying on a common polygon ; three big , two medium - sized , and two small circles corresponding , respectively , to the vectors from case  2 ( @xmath163 ) , case  3 ( @xmath164 ) , and case  4 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the patterns of the @xmath165 polygons were chosen in such a way to make ( the lines of ) the fano plane @xmath166 sitting in the middle of the `` snowflake '' readily discernible .",
    "the illustration is essentially three - dimensional .",
    "there is also a single `` vertical branch '' of the `` snowflake '' which emanates from the the middle of the figure and ramifies into three smaller branches . ]",
    "given the free left @xmath0-module @xmath3 , @xmath4 , of an arbitrary ring of ternions @xmath0 , we provide a complete classification of the vectors from @xmath3 ( lemma  [ lem : vectors ] ) and the cyclic submodules generated by them ( lemma  [ lem : points ] ) , up to the action of the group @xmath7 .",

    "the non - unimodular free cyclic submodules are linked with the lines of @xmath105 ) ( theorem  [ thm:1 ] ) . in the finite case ,",
    "we count explicitly the total number of non - unimodular free cyclic submodules as well as the cardinalities of their subsets passing through a given vector ( theorem  [ thm:2 ] ) . in light of the fact that there are only few papers on projective geometries over ternions",
    ", we hope that our findings will stir the interest of mathematicians into a more systematic treatment of exciting open problems in this particular branch of ring geometries , and will also prove fruitful for envisaged applications of projective geometries over ternions in quantum physics .",
