    "many authors have studied quantum phenomena in the gravitational fields of black holes .",

    "quantum bound states in the field of a schwarzschild black hole have been investigated by gaina and ternov using a perturbative approach  @xcite .",
    "they find quantum analogues of the classical effects of shift of the perihelion of orbit in a central field and precession of the orbital plane in the field of a rotating body .",
    "more recent work by grain and barrau  @xcite illustrates that quantum bound states ( with finite lifetimes ) with no classical analogue exist around black holes .",
    "work on these types of bound states has also been carried out by lasenby _",
    "et  al . _",
    "perturbative modification of electronic orbitals around charged black holes ( black hole `` atoms '' ) due to the curved manifold has also been considered  @xcite .    whilst black holes present a physically extreme case ,",
    "it is not obvious that these interesting quantum effects should be restricted to this type of object ; do similar quantum phenomena occur in the fields of finite - sized ( non - singular ) massive objects ?",
    "two separate but related topics that should be examined in a quantum framework are particle bound states and scattering .",
    "the work presented here deals with the former topic ; we will consider scattering in a separate paper .",
    "in this paper we numerically compute ground state energies for a scalar particle in the gravitational field of a non - rotating , spherically symmetric , massive body of finite size described by the florides interior metric .",
    "we examine the behaviour of these states in the limit that the metric becomes singular .",
    "this limit is characterized by the approach of the gravitating mass towards the schwarzschild mass @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radius of the object and @xmath2 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we also construct an approximate analytic model that verifies the calculated energy eigenvalues and illustrates the behaviour of the bound states .",
    "our results indicate that in the black hole limit the ground state energy tends to zero ; that is , the binding energy tends to the rest mass energy of the scalar particle .",
    "additionally , the energy spectrum becomes quasi - continuous in this limit .",
    "we repeat our calculations for objects described by the schwarzschild interior metric and find similar behaviour when this metric becomes singular ( in this case this corresponds to a pressure singularity at the origin , rather than the black hole limit ) .",
    "in order to determine the bound states of a scalar particle in the gravitational field of a finite - sized object we require a wave function that exists for all @xmath3 . this necessitates an interior as well as an exterior metric to substitute into the klein - gordon equation ( with @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the reciprocal of the metric and @xmath7 is the mass of the scalar particle .",
    "the metric on the exterior of a spherically symmetric non - rotating body of mass @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the schwarzschild radius of the gravitating object .",
    "the standard schwarzschild interior solution for a constant density sphere develops a pressure singularity when @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this forbids the investigation of the limit @xmath12 , thus we can not use it to examine the black hole case directly .",
    "we discuss this solution in section  [ sec : schwarzschild ] .",
    "an interior metric that does not contain this singularity is that developed by florides  @xcite : @xmath13 which is valid for @xmath14 . for @xmath15 the horizon ( coordinate ) singularity @xmath16  @xcite . substituting ( [ eq : exteriormetric ] ) and ( [ eq : interiormetric ] ) into ( [ eq : kg ] ) and assuming a separable solution of the form",
    "@xmath17 we derive the exterior and interior wave equations respectively as @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the scalar particle energy and @xmath21 the angular momentum .",
    "we see immediately that to have the @xmath22-dependent term in ( [ eq : interiorwave ] ) remain finite as @xmath12 ( for @xmath23 ) , we need @xmath24 . that is , all bound solutions of the klein - gordon equation must go towards zero energy in this limit .",

    "however , bound state solutions do exist for any @xmath29 .",
    "it is instructive to present approximate analytical results which are in good agreement with the numerical solutions .",
    "we start with a substitution of the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 for the interior and exterior wave equations , respectively .",
    "this transforms equations ( [ eq : exteriorwave ] ) and ( [ eq : interiorwave ] ) such that the first derivative of the wavefunction @xmath32 is removed .",
    "additionally , we rescale the energy by the mass such that @xmath33 and all lengths , including the compton radius of the scalar particle , by the radius of the object @xmath1 : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "thus both wave equations are transformed ( separately ) into the form @xmath37      transforming the exterior klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : exteriorwave ] ) yields the following coefficient @xmath38 from ( [ eq : transformed ] ) : @xmath39 taking a series expansion for large @xmath40 to second order yields @xmath41 the weak field limit has been considered previously ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references within ) , therefore we will instead concentrate on the strong field limit .",
    "we note that free motion corresponds to @xmath42 ; that is , @xmath43 in the original coordinate system of ( [ eq : exteriorwave ] ) .      transforming the interior klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : interiorwave ] ) yields the following coefficient @xmath38 from ( [ eq :",

    "thus the two equations we wish to compare are @xmath48 equating the coefficients of @xmath3 and using the solutions of the three dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator , with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , gives an equation for the squared scalar particle energy @xmath51 .",
    "the positive energy solution that corresponds to the energy eigenvalue is @xmath52 where @xmath53    we test the range of validity of our analytic approximation by considering some physical constraints on our harmonic oscillator model .",

    "formally we require @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 can be obtained using the virial theorem for our harmonic potential @xmath59 expanding @xmath60 about @xmath61 gives @xmath62    our second test is whether the expansion of @xmath38 as a harmonic potential is valid .",
    "the ratio of the coefficient of @xmath63 to that of @xmath64 is @xmath65 if the harmonic oscillator model is appropriate , this should be much less than one for relevant values of @xmath58 . while the coefficient of the @xmath63 term clearly begins to dominate at @xmath66 ( even for large @xmath56 ) , we simply require @xmath67 or @xmath68 this is automatically satisfied by the condition ( [ eq : interiorcondition ] ) . coefficients of higher powers of @xmath64 in @xmath38",

    "furthermore it can be seen by inspection of ( [ eq : interiorwave ] ) that in order for the wave equation to be devoid of singular terms as @xmath77 ( for @xmath78 ) we require @xmath79 , resulting in the entire bound state spectrum becoming quasi - continuous .",
    "that is , while all discrete energy levels tend toward zero in this limit , a bound excited state can be found with energy within @xmath80 of any @xmath81 if @xmath82 .",
    "as previously noted , the standard schwarzschild interior metric can not be used to calculate @xmath20 in the limit @xmath83 as a singularity in the metric occurs at @xmath84 where the coefficient of @xmath85 is zero for @xmath86 .",
    "physically this corresponds to the pressure becoming infinite at the center . for completeness",
    "we carry out the same numerical analysis of the energy levels and compare the result to that obtained by considering the particle in florides metric . the interior solution for a constant density fluid sphere developed by schwarzschild",
    "@xcite is given by @xmath87     ground state energy of the klein - gordon equation for the schwarzschild interior metric with @xmath88 .",

    "the vertical line corresponds to @xmath90.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    following the same procedure used to generate ( [ eq : exteriorwave ] ) and ( [ eq : interiorwave ] ) we construct an interior wave equation for @xmath91 .",
    "after rescaling the system as we did in the florides case this wave equation is solved numerically , the results of which are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : smetricfig ] as the solid line .    in order to analytically approximate @xmath92 in this system we transform the wave equation @xmath93 @xmath94 into an effective potential form .",
    "firstly we define new the parameter @xmath95 and new coordinate @xmath96 . after taking",
    "series expansion to order zero in @xmath97 , and performing the transformation @xmath98 we generate a wave equation for @xmath99 of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 in order for ( [ eq : schwarzschildveff ] ) to remain finite for a given @xmath56 in the limit that @xmath102 we must have @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a proportionality constant of order @xmath105 .",
    "to clarify , in our rescaled coordinates @xmath106 is independent of delta .",
    "thus the condition on @xmath20 as @xmath97 becomes small is valid .",
    "( [ eq : delta1 ] ) is plotted for @xmath89 and @xmath88 as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : smetricfig ] .",
    "the range of @xmath97 where this approximation is valid is found by considering the relative size of higher order @xmath97 terms in the series expansion used to generate ( [ eq : schwarzschildveff ] ) . by requiring subsequent higher order @xmath97 terms to be small",
    "compared to ( [ eq : schwarzschildveff ] ) , we find the range of validity of ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) for @xmath107 is @xmath108 the energy is small ( @xmath109 ) if @xmath110 together these constraints provide an adequate estimate of the window of @xmath97 for which ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) is valid .    from this analysis",
    "we find that the energy levels of scalar particles bound in the field of the schwarzschild interior metric approach zero as the metric becomes singular at @xmath84 .",
    "by matching the florides interior metric to the standard schwarzschild exterior metric we are able to use the klein - gordon equation to construct the wave function over all space for a scalar particle in the gravitational field of a finite - sized spherically - symmetric static mass . numerical computation of the ground state energies of the scalar particle shows that the existence of a zero energy bound state may only be possible in the limit that the gravitating object described by the florides metric becomes a black hole .",
    "this result is verified using an approximate analytical calculation .",
    "it is seen that the entire bound state spectrum collapses to @xmath111 as @xmath77 .",
    "the spectrum becomes quasi - continuous in this limit : the energies and the intervals between the energy levels are proportional to @xmath112 . if we keep energy fixed the principal quantum number of the level @xmath113 tends to infinity .",
    "similar results are obtained by considering the behaviour of a scalar particle in the background of a fluid sphere of constant density as modeled by the schwarzschild interior metric . in this case",
    "we find that as the metric becomes singular at @xmath114 the energy of the particle tends to zero as @xmath115 .",
    "the existence of a bound state with zero energy is relevant to the phenomenon of particle pair production . due to quantum fluctuations ,",
    "particle anti - particle pairs are produced around a black hole and it is possible that one of the pair escapes the gravitational field : this is known as the hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "this occurs when the pair is created with each member of the pair on opposite sides of the event horizon : one particle falls in while the other escapes to infinity .",
    "other systems that give rise to pair production , also known as vacuum breakdown , include static and dynamic electromagnetic fields ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) and time - varying gravitational fields ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in the coulomb case",
    "it is clear that one of the pair must be repelled , since the pair have opposite charge . in the gravitational case , however , both particles will possess the same ` gravitational charge ' and thus will be attracted by the potential . in the black hole case",
    "the existence of the event horizon as a barrier facilitates one particle escaping to infinity as the other falls to the singularity .    for zero energy states to exist ( a necessary but not sufficient condition for particle production and hawking radiation ) in the metrics we have considered",
    ", the metric must become singular . for pair production with the ejection of one particle to infinity",
    "it is actually necessary to have a negative energy level @xmath116 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the gravitational field case with the electrostatic potential case where pair creation is possible in a strong coulomb field @xmath117 .",
    "( for example , the ground state of an electron orbiting a finite - size nucleus reaches the lower continuum when @xmath118 . for a scalar particle of the same mass",
    ", @xmath119 should be greater than @xmath120  @xcite . ) in the coulomb case we have @xmath121 in the wave equation .",
    "therefore , increasing the absolute value @xmath122 of the negative potential @xmath117 leads to the negative energy @xmath20 .",
    "in the gravitational field we have @xmath22 in the wave equation and such a procedure can not introduce negative energy bound states ."
