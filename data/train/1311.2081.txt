    "<S> although we have not yet established rigorously that this recipe yields an algorithm , nor estimated its running time ( though see remark [ rmk : makerigorous ] ) , we can verify that the results of our computations are correct . </S>",
    "<S> herein , we exhibit the method and present some computed examples of high complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> a is a map of connected riemann surfaces @xmath1 that is unramified away from @xmath2 . by the theorem of bely  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a riemann surface @xmath3 admits a bely  map if and only if @xmath3 can be defined over @xmath4 as an algebraic curve .    </S>",
    "<S> the input to our method comes from the combinatorial description of bely  maps : there is a bijection between bely  maps of degree @xmath5 up to isomorphism and of degree @xmath6 ,    @xmath7 such that @xmath8 and + @xmath9 is a transitive subgroup    up to simultaneous conjugation in @xmath10 . </S>",

    "<S> our first main result is to exhibit a numerical method for drawing dessins conformally ( compactly ) in the geometry @xmath16 , where @xmath16 is the sphere , euclidean plane , or hyperbolic plane : in other words , we are concerned with the specific geometric form of the dessin . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by working with the corresponding triangle group @xmath17 , determining explicitly the associated finite index subgroup @xmath18 , and then drawing the dessin on @xmath16 together with the gluing relations which define the quotient @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> our second main result is to use this explicit description of the riemann surface @xmath3 to compute an equation for the bely  map @xmath20 numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the main algorithmic tool for this purpose is the method of power series expansions due to voight  </S>",
    "<S> willis @xcite and developed further by the first author @xcite ; the original idea goes back to hejhal @xcite and stark </S>",
    "<S> . an important feature of this method is that it works directly on the desired riemann surface , and hence there are no `` parasitic '' solutions to discard as in other methods @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea to compute covers using modular forms can also be found in the work of selander and strmbergsson @xcite ; our approach is ` cocompact ' and thus parallel to their ` noncocompact ' method using @xmath21-expansions on the modular group . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> these authors use @xmath22 , the free group on @xmath23 generators , also known in this context as the triangle group @xmath24 , so in all cases , triangle groups figure prominently </S>",
    "<S> . it will be interesting to compare the relative advantages of these two approaches ; one advantage of our approach is that we do not have to compute @xmath21-expansions at each of the cusps .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : background ] , we quickly review the relevant background material on bely  maps . in section [ sec : embedtriangle ] , we realize triangle groups explicitly as fuchsian groups . in section [ sec : cosets ] , we exhibit an algorithm that takes a permutation triple @xmath11 and realizes the cosets of the point stabilizer subgroup @xmath25 ; this algorithm also yields a reduction algorithm and a fundamental domain for the action of @xmath18 on the upper half - plane @xmath26 ( the generic geometry @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then show how these fit together in our first main result , to conformally draw dessins . </S>",
    "<S> next , in section [ sec : powser ] , we discuss power series expansions of differentials on riemann @xmath23-orbifolds and recall a method for computing these expansions . in section [ sec : examples ] , we compute equations arising from these expansions , refined using newton s method ; along the way , we present several complete examples .    as an illustration of our method </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the degree 50 rational bely  map </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 where @xmath28 realizing the group @xmath29 regularly over @xmath30 ( example [ exm : psu3(5 ) ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a polynomial was known to exist by the general theory @xcite , but the explicit polynomial is new . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that other covers of large degree and arithmetic complexity can be similarly computed , greatly extending the set of examples known , and consequently that our method can be used to understand more comprehensively the action of @xmath0 on dessins , following grothendieck .    </S>",
