    "matter - wave bright solitons therefore represent an intriguing combination of nonlinear and quantum physics .",

    "which for the case of constant potential is also known as the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation , it is well known that solutions collapse in finite time  @xcite .",
    "this collapse can be prevented , below a certain critical nonlinearity , by the addition of a spatially varying external potential .",
    "intensive studies of collapse dynamics  @xcite were initially inspired by experiments on the attractive bec  @xcite and by the possibility of efficient implementation of feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "the latter use an external magnetic field to tune the @xmath0-wave scattering length which controls the strength of the nonlinearity governing the collapse : in particular , @xmath1rb has been the subject of recent experiments  @xcite . in @xmath2li",
    "there exists a feshbach resonance around 725 gauss for the state @xmath3 which is amenable to the study of _ stable _ phenomena in attractive bec s : the scattering length for @xmath4 is positive , and becomes slightly negative between 150 and 525 gauss , far from the resonance and thus far from the region in which three - body losses are significant .",

    "@xcite to transform a stable attractive bec into a matter - wave bright soliton was as follows .",
    "a bec with positive scattering length was condensed into a harmonic trap .",
    "the trap was adiabatically  @xcite deformed into a cigar - shaped geometry , _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the longitudinal and axial oscillation frequencies of the atoms in the trapping potential , respectively .",
    "the scattering length was then tuned via a feshbach resonance to be small and negative .",
    "the resulting condensate , a metastable macroscopic quantum bound state of about 5000 particles , was projected onto an _ expulsive _ harmonic potential in the longitudinal direction .",
    "it was then observed to propagate , without spreading , over a distance of 1.1 mm , in contrast to an ideal gas , which is exploded exponentially by the potential .",
    "thus it was the use of the expulsive potential which provided clear evidence of a self - trapped , soliton - like state .    in this paper the stability and dynamics of a matter - wave bright soliton in an expulsive potential",

    "section  [ sec : nonlinear ] studies the dynamical effects particular to an expulsive potential : the equations of motion for the soliton parameters are derived ; weak excitations are shown to be exponentially damped ; higher order solitons created by sudden changes in the scattering length are shown to persist in the presence of the potential ; and an intriguing form of macroscopic nonlinear tunneling , which we call _ quantum evaporation _ , is described .",
    "the latter eventually leads to explosion of the soliton .",
    "a form of nonlinear tunneling similar to this has already been experimentally observed in the context of the relaxation of condensate spin domains  @xcite . finally , in sec .",

    "@xmath126 is determined by evaluating the norm squared of the wavefunction as a function of time , since the absorbing bounds remove atoms outside the immediate region of the soliton .",
    "thus , provided that the soliton is created with width and length dimensions that lie within the bounds obtained from variational studies of the final parameter set , one may expect it to shed in a time @xmath164 its excess mass and come to rest at the local minimum of the energy surface .",

    "as with the soliton of order one , higher order solitons persist in the presence of a sufficiently weak expulsive potential .    one supposes two experimental approaches : in the first , a soliton , already formed in an expulsive potential , is subjected to a sudden change in the scattering length ; alternatively , the scattering length of an attractive condensate trapped in an attractive harmonic potential is simultaneously shifted by a factor of four with the projection of the soliton onto a weakly expulsive potential .",
    "the latter may be easier for observing oscillations of the soliton shape , since the center of mass in unstable unless the relative position of the potential and the soliton are continuously adjusted . in either case",
    "the initial scattering length must be chosen such that it satisfies eq .",
