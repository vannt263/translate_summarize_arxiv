    "the largest outbreak of ebola virus ever recorded has been ongoing since was first confirmed in march , 2014 .",
    "ebola is a fatal disease that has claimed 7 000 lives by the end of 2014 in just guinea , liberia and sierra lione .",
    "while the ebola outbreak has slowed down across west africa by june 2015 , every new infection continues to threaten millions of lives and bringing fear to the world . with",
    "more than 24 000 cases and almost 10 000 fatalities , this outbreak is already one of the biggest public health crises of the xxi century . overcoming ebola is a complex emergency , challenging not only governments and international aid organisations but also computational and life scientists and applied mathematicians @xcite .    in a recent work by rachah and torres ,",
    "an optimal control problem of the 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa was posed and numerically solved through and the toolkit @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a different model and other numerical simulations .",
    "in contrast , here we address the problem by analytical methods .",
    "the results confirm the previous numerical results , but now with a theoretical / analytical foundation .",
    "the new method is simple but envolves lengthy calculations .",
    "for this reason , a computer algebra package with the proposed method is developed in .",
    "the text is organized as follows . in section  [ prob ]",
    "the optimal control problem is formulated .",
    "our method is explained in section  [ meth ] and illustrated with an example .",
    "then , in section  [ resu ] , we apply it to the ebola optimal control problem .",
    "we end with section  [ conclu ] of conclusions , while appendix  [ apen ] provides the developed code .",
    "the ebola problem of optimal control proposed in @xcite consists to determine the control function @xmath0 in such a way the objective functional given by @xmath1{dt}\\ ] ] is minimized , where @xmath2 is a fixed nonnegative constant , when subject to the dynamic equations @xmath3 for all @xmath4,\\ ] ] the given initial conditions @xmath5 and where the control values are bounded in the interval @xmath6 $ ] , that is , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the duration of the application of the control ( duration of the vaccination program ) .",
    "the constant @xmath9 is a control value that is able to eliminate the ebola transmission according with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the basic reproduction number for the system  , and control @xmath12 is considered constant along all time .",
    "this control @xmath13 is however not optimal .",
    "for this reason , we search for an optimal value of @xmath14 , @xmath15 $ ] , subject to the constraint given by .",
    "note that the control @xmath14 represents the vaccination rate at time @xmath16 .",
    "being the fraction of susceptible individuals vaccinated per unit of time , the value @xmath9 means that , at maximum , 90% of susceptible are vaccinated . in other words , what we assume here",
    "is that the fraction of individuals who are not vaccinated takes at least the value of 10% .",
    "this is in agreement with general experience in vaccination , where it is well recognized the impossibility to vaccinate all population . for more details on the description of the mathematical model and the meaning of the parameters , we refer the reader to the work of rachah and torres @xcite . in particular , see the scheme of the susceptible - infected - recovered model with vaccination found in section  4.2 of @xcite and the optimal control problem in section  5 of @xcite , where the following parameters , initial conditions , and time horizon are considered : infection rate @xmath17 ; recovery rate @xmath18 ; at the beginning 95% of population is susceptible and 5% is already infected , that is , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; and @xmath22 days . differently from previous works @xcite , which are exclusively based on numerical methods ,",
    "we address the optimal control problem  by using an approximated analytic method .",
    "for that we make use of the computer algebra system .",
    "in this section the approximated analytical method that is used in section  [ resu ] to solve the optimal control problem  is explained and illustrated with an example .",
    "the idea is to use the classical calculus of variations , specifically the euler  lagrange equation , which is its main tool .",
    "the euler  lagrange equation is used with the aim to obtain a first - order approximation to the pontryagin maximum principle .",
    "typically , the pontryagin maximum principle is harder to solve analytically than the euler  lagrange equation .",
    "in contrast , the euler ",
    "lagrange equations can be easily solved analytically in many interesting cases . in our work",
    "we perform an analytical experiment consisting to solve analytically the optimal control problem  , which was previously solved numerically in @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in section  [ resu ] , our approach turns out to be a good one .",
    "let us start with the dynamical control system @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the state vector that must be controlled and @xmath0 is the control that must be applied to the system in order to minimize the functional @xmath25{d t},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the parameter that is determining the cost of the control and @xmath8 is the duration of application of the control . comparing the objective functionals and , we are assuming that @xmath26 .",
    "this is a particular case of the more general assumption @xmath27 from the epidemiological point of view , given that system  can be considered as a black box , being the input @xmath14 and the output @xmath28 , it is possible to think that @xmath28 is approximately given by a series of the form . given that @xmath28 is always positive , we use even powers of @xmath29 .",
    "the simplest assumption is then @xmath26 , which makes functional to take the form of the lagrangian for the classical harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is possible to use other forms for @xmath28 as a function of @xmath14 and its derivatives . for our purposes ,",
    "the simplest expression @xmath26 is enough .",
    "the euler  lagrange equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) associated with is @xmath30 and the solution of with the conditions @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 in we are assuming that @xmath12 is of class @xmath33 : the classical euler  lagrange equation is a second - order differential equation",
    ". the exact solution @xmath12 is not necessarily @xmath33 , but it can always be approximated by a @xmath33 function .",
    "note that our goal is to find an approximated analytical solution and not the exact one . replacing in",
    ", we obtain that @xmath34 now we assume that equation can be solved analytically when subject to the initial condition @xmath35 .",
    "then , formally , it is possible to write that @xmath36 to determine @xmath37 , we minimize the following functional : @xmath38{dt}.\\ ] ] replacing and in , we obtain that @xmath39 taking the derivative of with respect to @xmath37 and equating the result to zero , we have @xmath40 the parameter @xmath2 is determined according to @xmath41 that is , we assume that at the half of the duration of the application of the control , the intensity of the control is reduced by a factor @xmath42 with respect to the initial intensity .",
    "then the solution of is given by @xmath43 finally , solving equation with respect to @xmath37 , using and the numerical values for the other parameters , the values for @xmath37 and @xmath2 are obtained and the explicit form of the control @xmath14 given by is specified .    to illustrate the method that was just explained , we consider now a simple toy model .",
    "[ ex ] let @xmath44 and @xmath45 the problem here is to control the variable @xmath28 using @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the control @xmath14 has the form given by .",
    "the expression is the solution of the differential equation , which is the euler  lagrange equation for the functional with the assumption @xmath26 .",
    "if the more general assumption is used , then the corresponding euler ",
    "lagrange equation will be more complex and the explicit solution will involve special functions , such as airy , bessel , kummer , whittaker , and heun functions . replacing in ,",
    "we obtain that @xmath46 an approximated analytical solution of equation can be obtained for the early stages of the outbreak when @xmath47 . with this approximation ,",
    "is reduced to @xmath48 and the explicit solution of with the initial condition @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 for the early stages of the outbreak , equation takes the form @xmath51 using with @xmath52 and , we derive that @xmath53 taking the derivative of with respect to @xmath37 , equating the result to zero and solving with respect to @xmath37 , we have that @xmath54 the control @xmath14 is completely determined by replacing and in .",
    "all these computations are easily done with the help of a computer algebra system ( see appendix  [ sec : ap : a1 ] ) .",
    "with the aim to apply the method explained in section  [ meth ] to the ebola problem  , we assume that equation can be reduced to @xmath55 at the very early stages of the outbreak . in other words , we assume that @xmath56 for @xmath16 near to zero , that is , at the beginning of the outbreak the depletion in the number of susceptible individuals is due to the vaccination , given that the reduction in the number of susceptible individuals due to infection is depreciated . then the solution of with initial condition @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 at the beginning of the outbreak , is reduced to @xmath59 now equation with takes the form @xmath60 the solution of with initial condition @xmath49 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the exponential integral function defined by @xmath63 for the early stages of the outbreak , equality is reduced to @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 replacing  and into the functional , with @xmath52 , we obtain that @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 taking the derivative of with respect to @xmath37 , using  , and equating the result to zero , we have that @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 solving with respect to @xmath37 and taking into account  , we derive that @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 now we use the following numerical values for the relevant parameters : @xmath79 these values are used here for numerical experimentation",
    ". it is , however , possible to consider other values ( the concrete values are not critical for the experiments ) .",
    "we obtain from that @xmath80 using , and the expression for @xmath37 given by  , we obtain that @xmath81 replacing and in , we obtain that the optimal control is given by @xmath82 now the system  is numerically solved with and the initial conditions @xmath83 we obtain the curves of figures  [ fig:6][fig:9 ] ( for all the details see the code in appendix  [ sec : ap : a2 ] ) .",
    "our results reproduce the numerical results of rachah and torres @xcite using the simplest assumption @xmath26 .",
    "note that this assumption is not directly linked to the numerical results of @xcite : the assumption @xmath26 is a particular case of . in the case",
    "we do not have the numerical results in advance , we can use the general form and experiment with different terms of such series to get the best possible results .",
    "the analytical expression for the optimal control drawn at figure  [ fig:6 ] is very similar to the optimal control numerically depicted in @xcite .",
    "similarly , figures  [ fig:7 ] , [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] , respectively for the susceptible , infected and removed individuals , are identical to the corresponding numerical results of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the numerical solutions found in @xcite provide a good approximation to our analytical expressions .",
    "we claim that the analytical method proposed here can also be applied with success to other problems of optimal control in mathematical epidemiology such as vector - borne , air - borne and water - borne diseases .",
    "this question is under investigation and will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "we have used the computer algebra system for all the computations .",
