    "the recent explosion@xcite of research on the electronic properties of single layer and stacked multilayer graphene sheets has been driven by advances in material preparation methods@xcite , by the unusual@xcite electronic properties of these materials including unusual quantum hall effects@xcite , and by hopes that these elegantly tunable systems might be useful electronic materials . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate an unanticipated low - energy property of graphene multilayers , which follows from an interplay between interlayer tunneling and the chiral properties of low - energy quasiparticles in an isolated graphene sheet .",
    "our conclusions apply in the strongest form to models with only nearest - neighbor interlayer tunneling , but are valid over a broad field range as we explain below .",
    "we find that the low - energy band structure of any graphene multilayer consists of a set of independent pseudospin doublets . within each doublet ,",
    "the bands are described by a pseudospin hamiltonian of the form @xmath4 , \\label{eq : chiralband}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a pauli matrix acting on the doublet pseudospin , @xmath6 is an envelope function momentum measured from either the @xmath7 or @xmath8 corner of the honeycomb lattice s brillouin - zone@xcite , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the orientation of @xmath6 .",

    "( [ eq : chiralband ] ) assumes the opposite signs in graphene s @xmath7 and @xmath8 valleys . following the earlier work on graphene bilayers@xcite",
    ", we refer to @xmath12 as the chirality index of a doublet . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 yields the @xmath12 landau levels at @xmath15 and @xmath16 levels with @xmath17 . taking the twofold spin and valley degeneracies into account",
    ", the number of independent zero - energy band eigenstates at the dirac point ( @xmath18 ) is therefore @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of pseudospin doublets .",
    "we find that , although @xmath21 depends on the details of the stacking sequence , @xmath22 in an @xmath0-layer stack .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) that the hall conductivity of an @xmath0-layer stack has strong integer quantum hall effects with plateau conductivities , @xmath23 where @xmath3 is a non - negative integer .     and @xmath24 .",
    "given a starting graphene sheet , the honeycomb lattice for the next layer is positioned by displacing either @xmath25 or @xmath24 sublattice carbon atoms along a honeycomb edge .",
    "this results in three distinct two - dimensional sheets , labeled by a , b , and c. representative @xmath25 and @xmath24 sublattice positions in a , b , and c layers are identified in this illustration .",
    "it is also possible to transform between layer types by rotating by 60@xmath26 about one of the carbon atoms .",
    "( b ) each added layer cycles around this stacking triangle in either the right - handed or the left - handed sense .",
    "reversals of the sense of this rotation tend to increase the number of low - energy pseudospin doublets @xmath20 . in graphite ,",
    "the bernal ( ab ) stacking corresponds to a reversal at every step and orthorhombic ( abc ) stacking corresponds to no reversals . ]",
    "when one graphene layer is placed on another , it is energetically favorable@xcite for the atoms of either @xmath25 or @xmath24 sublattices to be displaced along the honeycomb edges , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stack ] .",
    "this stacking rule implies the three distinct but equivalent projections ( labeled a , b , and c ) of the three - dimensional structure s honeycomb - lattice layers onto the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane and @xmath29 distinct @xmath0-layer stack sequences .",
    "when a b layer is placed on an a layer , a c layer on a b layer , or an a layer on a c layer , the @xmath25 sites of the upper layer are above the @xmath24 sites of the lower layer and therefore linked by the nearest interlayer neighbor @xmath30-orbital hopping amplitude @xmath31 . for the corresponding anticyclic stacking choices ( a on b , b on c , or c on a ) , it is the @xmath24 sites of the upper layer and the @xmath25 sites of the lower layer that are linked .",
    "layer stacks . the low - energy band and the landau level structure of a graphene stack",
    "are readily read off these diagrams as explained in the text .",
    "shaded ovals link @xmath25 and @xmath24 nearest interlayer neighbors . ]",
    "all distinct @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 layer stacks are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : min_diagrams ] , in which we have arbitrarily labeled the first two layers starting from the bottom as a and b. the low - energy band and the landau level structure can be read off these diagrams by partitioning a stack using the following rules , which are justified in the following section .",
    "( i ) identify the longest nonoverlapping segments within which there are no reversals of stacking sense .",
    "when there is ambiguity in the selection of nonoverlapping segments , choose the partitioning which incorporates the largest number of layers .",
    "each segment ( including for interior segments the end layers at which reversals take place ) defines a @xmath12-layer partition of the stack and may be associated with a chirality @xmath12 doublet .",
    "( ii ) iteratively partition of the remaining segments of the stack into smaller @xmath12 elements , excluding layers contained within previously identified partitions , until all layers are exhausted .",
    "chirality decompositions which follow from these rules are summarized in table [ tab : decomposition ] .",
    "note that this procedure can result in @xmath35 doublets associated with separated single layers which remain at the last step in the partitioning process .    in applying these rules ,",
    "the simplest case is cyclic abc stacking for which there are no stacking sense reversals and therefore a single @xmath36 partition . in the opposite limit , ab stacking , the stacking sense is reversed in every layer and the rules imply @xmath37 partitions with @xmath38 for even @xmath0 , and when @xmath0 is odd a remaining @xmath35 partition . between these two limits , a rich variety of qualitatively distinct low - energy behaviors",
    "for example , in the abcb stacked tetralayer , abc is identified as a @xmath39 doublet and the remaining b layer gives a @xmath35 doublet .",
    "the low - energy band structure and the landau level structure of this stack , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stack_abcb ] , have two sets of low - energy bands with @xmath40 , landau levels with @xmath41 , and four zero - energy landau levels per spin and valley .",
    "all these properties are predicted by the partitioning rules .",
    "we have explicitly checked that the rules correctly reproduce the low - energy electronic structure for all stacking sequences up to @xmath42 . because each layer is a member of one and only one partition ,",
    "the partitioning rules imply the chirality sum rule in eq .",

    "an @xmath0-layer stack has a two - dimensional band structure with @xmath51 atoms per unit cell .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 accounts for interlayer tunneling and @xmath54 for intralayer tunneling .",
    "@xmath54 is the direct product of massless dirac model hamiltonians @xmath55 for the sublattice pseudospin degrees of freedom of each layer .",
    "we construct a low - energy hamiltonian by first identifying the zero - energy eigenstates of @xmath56 and then treating @xmath54 as a perturbation .    referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : min_diagrams ] , we see that @xmath53 is the direct product of a set of finite - length one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding chains and a null matrix with dimension equal to the number of isolated sites .",
    "an elementary calculation gives the following eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a chain of length @xmath57 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the chain eigenvalue index and @xmath60 .",
    "note that odd @xmath57 chains have a zero - energy eigenstate with an eigenvector that has nonzero amplitudes , constant in magnitude and alternating in sign , on the sublattice of the chain ends .",
    "the set of zero - energy eigenstates of @xmath53 consists of the states localized on isolated sites and the single zero - energy eigenstates of each odd - length chain .",
    "the low - energy effective hamiltonian is evaluated by applying leading order degenerate state perturbation theory to the zero - energy subspace .",
    "the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian between degenerate zero - energy states @xmath61 and @xmath62 is given by@xcite @xmath63^{n-1}\\left|\\psi_{r'}\\right>,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the smallest positive integer for which the matrix element is nonzero , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 is a projection operator onto the zero - energy subspace . to understand the structure of this hamiltonian , it is helpful to start with some simple examples .    for abc stacked @xmath0-layer graphene , the zero - energy states are the two isolated site states in top and bottom layers , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the high - energy hilbert space is formed from a set of two - site chains .",
    "because @xmath68 is diagonal in layer index and @xmath56 ( and hence @xmath69 ) can change the layer index by one unit , the lowest order at which @xmath66 and @xmath67 are coupled is @xmath70 .",
    "it follows that @xmath71 thus , the effective hamiltonian of @xmath0-layer graphene with abc stacking has a single @xmath36 doublet@xcite . for ab",
    "stacked @xmath0-layer graphene , the high - energy hilbert space consists of a single @xmath0-site 1d chain , excluding its zero- energy eigenvalue when @xmath0 is odd .",
    "there is an isolated site in each layer which is connected to both its neighbors at order @xmath72 forming an isolated site chain .",
    "when @xmath0 is even , this chain is diagonalized by @xmath37 , @xmath38 doublets formed between @xmath25-sublattice and @xmath24-sublattice chain states@xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 is odd , the zero - energy chain state is mapped to an equal - magnitude oscillating - sign linear combination of isolated site states by intralayer tunneling at order @xmath73 , yielding a @xmath35 doublet .",
    "the @xmath74 , @xmath38 doublets are then formed between @xmath25-sublattice and @xmath24-sublattice isolated site chain states in the orthogonal portion of the isolated state subspace .    a more complex and more typical example is realized by placing a single reversed layer on top of abc stacked n - layer graphene with @xmath75 . in this case , we obtain @xmath76 using a @xmath77 basis .",
    "here , @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the three - site chain zero - energy state , @xmath80 . the first @xmath81 block in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian_abcb_eff ] ) gives a @xmath35 doublet with a reduced velocity .",
    "the @xmath36 doublet in this instance includes both the @xmath82 subspace contribution and an equal contribution due to perturbative coupling to the @xmath83 subspace .",
    "the final hamiltonian is reduced to @xmath84 where @xmath85 the relationship between the electronic structure of a general stack and the partitioning procedure explained above can be understood as follows .",
    "first , note that a partition with chirality @xmath12 has isolated sites in its terminal layers that are coupled at order @xmath12 in perturbation theory .",
    "in the case of @xmath35 partition , the chain opposite to the single isolated site always has an odd length and provides the zero - energy partner ; isolated site to chain coupling therefore always occurs at first order .",
    "next , consider the perturbation theory , truncating at successively higher orders .",
    "when truncated at first order , the @xmath35 partitions are isolated by higher @xmath12 blocks within which the hamiltonian vanishes .",
    "each @xmath35 partition therefore yields a separate massless dirac equation with velocities@xcite that can be smaller than the graphene sheet dirac velocity .",
    "when the perturbation theory is truncated at second order , the hamiltonian becomes nonzero within the @xmath38 partitions .",
    "the eigenenergies within the @xmath35 partitions are parametrically larger , and the hamiltonian within the @xmath86 partitions is still zero . to leading order therefore , the @xmath38 partitions are separated , and their isolated states are coupled at the second order in perturbation theory so that each provides a @xmath38 doublet such as that of an isolated bilayer",
    ". if two or more @xmath38 partitions are adjacent , then their hamiltonians do not separate . in this case",
    ", there is a chain of second order couplings between isolated states , such as those of an even - length ab stack , but the end result is still @xmath38 doublet for each @xmath38 partition .",
    "the identification between partitions and chiral doublets can be established by continuing this consideration up to the highest values of @xmath12 which occur for a particular stack .",
    "then , the effective hamiltonian of any @xmath0-layer graphene is as follows : @xmath87 with the sum rule in eq .",

    "[ fig : iqhe4 ] , we plot the noninteracting hall conductivity as a function of the fermi energy for the four distinct four - layer stacks .",
    "when electron - electron interactions are included at an electrostatic mean - field ( hartree ) level , charge redistribution changes the positions of plateaus which are away from the dirac point , but it does not alter the conductivity jumps at the dirac point . if we allow the remote hopping , a small @xmath109 plateau appears at the dirac point for the abab staked tetralayer due to the energy gap opened by @xmath91 .",
    "this small gap is likely to be important only in very weak disorder samples , in which case electron - electron interactions beyond the hartree level are also likely to be important@xcite .",
    "the property that the hall conductivity jumps by four units on crossing the dirac point for arbitrarily stacked tetralayer graphene is the most obvious experimental manifestation of the chirality sum rule discussed in this paper . in practice charged multilayers ( @xmath110 ) would normally be prepared by placing the system on one side of an electrode and gating . even though gating will redistribute charge and shift energies differently in different layers",
    ", the landau level bunching we discussed should still be clearly reflected in quantum hall effect measurements .    in numerical calculations",
    ", we have found that for many stacks , the @xmath0-fold degeneracy at @xmath1 persists even outside the field range over which the minimal model is accurate . because of the topological character of the quantum hall effect , we expect the plateaus at @xmath111 to be exceptionally robust in most stacks , and that plateaus at the smaller hall conductivity samples will require exceptionally high quality samples .",
    "we do not anticipate strong quantum hall effects with @xmath112 unless gaps between the landau levels are enhanced by interactions@xcite in very high quality@xcite samples .",
    "finally , we note that chiral two - dimensional electron system tend toward momentum - space vortex states in which charge is spontaneously shifted between layers@xcite and that these instabilities are stronger in systems with larger @xmath12 .",
