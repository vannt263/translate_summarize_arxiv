    "_ solitary waves _",
    ", localized structures that translate at constant velocity while maintaining their spatial profile , are among the most important concept in nonlinear physics .",
    "_ solitons _ are a class of solitary waves which possess an additional underlying mathematical structure , one which renders the equations solvable , and which , in particular , causes the behavior of colliding solitons to be strikingly simple : solitons survive a collision with their shape and velocity intact , but with their positions shifted by a finite , computable , amount .    as long as scientists have known about solitary waves and had computers capable of simulating them , we have been colliding solitary waves together numerically and observing what comes out .",
    "an important example is the collision of so - called _ kink _ and _ antikink _ solutions to the @xmath0 equation , @xmath1 the first studies in the 1970 s gave a fleeting hint of rich structure and the first step toward understanding it .",
    "this was explored more deeply and given a name , the _ two - bounce resonance _ , in the 1980 s .",
    "in the 1990 s , more detailed numerical experiments revealed chaotic scattering .",
    "finally , in the early 2000 s , the mechanism behind this chaotic scattering was explained fully using techniques from dynamical systems . figure  [ fig : inout ] shows the speed at which a kink and antikink separate as a function their speed of approach , demonstrating a rich structure .",
    "numerical simulations of partial differential equations ( pde ) arising in diverse areas of physics have revealed the same phenomenon . in all that time , however , _ this behavior has never been reported in a physical experiment in a real nonlinear wave system_.     system for pde  , phenomenological ode system  , and the discrete map  .",
    "color indicates number of collisions before separation : one ( black ) , two ( blue ) , three ( green ) , and four ( red ) . ]",
    "this paper describes a simple experiment  a ball set rolling on a manufactured landscape  which mimics the dynamics of solitary wave collisions and reproduces some features of figure  [ fig : inout ] .",
    "the main tool for understanding solitary wave interaction has been the derivation and analysis of _ collective coordinate _ ( cc ) models .",
    "the landscape is constructed such that the ball s equations of motion strongly resemble the ordinary differential equation system ( ode ) governing the evolution of solution parameters described by a cc reduction describing solitary wave collisions in the @xmath0 equation .",
    "chaotic scattering is an appealing phenomenon to study because images such as figure  [ fig : inout ] cry out for explanation .",
    "the mathematical structure that has been developed is equally appealing , as is well - described by ott.@xcite a scattering process is a physical phenomenon in which an object s trajectory begins and ends in free motion ( i.e.  with zero acceleration ) but spends a finite time in a region where it is subject to forces .",
    "such a process is called chaotic scattering if the final state depends in a complex , i.e.  fractal or multi - fractal , manner on its initial state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : history ] discusses where the problem comes from and what approaches have been most useful in understanding it .",
    "it begins with a brief recap of the history of solitons , followed by an explanation of the difference between solitons and garden - variety solitary waves .",
    "it then describes the long history of chaotic scattering of solitary waves , the progress that has been made , and that methods that have been used to explain the observations . in section  [ sec : model ] , we describe the laboratory experiment and the mathematical model that describes it , while in section  [ sec : experiment ] , we present the experimental results , which we interpret as the two - bounce resonance , the aspect of chaotic scattering that is most robust in the presence of dissipation .",
    "we end in section  [ sec : plea ] by reviewing the physical systems that have motivated many of earlier studies of the two - bounce / chaotic scattering phenomenon and expressing our hope that someone may perform this experiment to display this phenomenon in an extended physical system .",
    "_ solitary waves _ are solutions to a nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equation ( pde ) that translate at a constant speed while maintaining its spatial profile .",
    "_ solitons _ are solitary waves which exhibit unexpectedly simple dynamics upon collision .",
    "this is due to a hidden mathematical structure that was discovered beginning in the 1960 s , first for the korteweg - de vries equation@xcite , @xmath2 and later for many other equations , such as the sine - gordon equation , @xmath3 such soliton equations can be solved exactly using a method called the inverse scattering transform ( ist).@xcite good brief histories of solitary waves and solitons can be found elsewhere , e.g. in encyclopedia articles by scott@xcite , and by zabusky and porter.@xcite    the ist can be used to explicitly show that after colliding , solitons continue propagating with the same shape and speed , but with a phase shift and a time delay .",
    "most nonlinear wave equations do not possess the ist , however , and solitary waves collisions in such systems display more complicated dynamicsn .",
    "beginning in the 1970 s , numerical simulations hinted this picture , but it took the development of more powerful computer hardware and numerical methods for the true complexity of this dynamics to fully emerge .",
    "the simultaneous development of _ collective coordinate methods _ would prove useful for untangling this complexity .",
    "the term `` collective coordinates '' refers to a variety of methods that are used to obtain simple ode models that approximate the behavior of a pde , at least as long as the solution stays in some small region of solution space .",
    "a very useful approach is the `` variational method '' , which applies to partial differential equations that arise as the euler - lagrange equations for a system with lagrangian density @xmath4 for example , solutions of the @xmath0 equation   minimize the action due to @xmath5 over all @xmath6 function satisfying appropriate boundary conditions at infinity .    the variational method , due originally to bondeson,@xcite works by constructing a solution ansatz whose spatial profile depends on a small number of time - dependent parameters and minimizing the action   with respect to these parameters .",
    "the resulting equation is a finite - dimensional lagrangian system of ode governing the parameters evolution .",
    "many examples and some generalizations are given in the review paper of malomed.@xcite      solitary waves exist in the @xmath0 equation  , which is non - integrable , despite its clear similarity to the sine - gordon equation  .",
    "these `` kink '' waves are given by @xmath7 the `` antikink '' solution is just @xmath8 .",
    "many papers have been written about kink - antikink ( kk ) collisions in this system . in 1975 , kudryavtsev@xcite found numerically that when @xmath9 , the kk  pair coalesce into a single bound state at the origin which oscillates irregularly and is slowly damped to zero .",
    "he explained this with a formal argument based on potential energy which can be considered a first step toward an explanatory collective coordinates model .    in 1979 , sugiyama@xcite performed additional experiments for a few values of @xmath10 between 0.1 and 0.6 .",
    "he found that those with speeds below a critical value @xmath11 the kk  pair merge into a localized bound state , while for @xmath12 , the pair collides inelastically . careful examination of his simulations showed that , upon collision , an oscillatory mode ( sometimes called a `` shape mode '' , since its effect is to alter the shape of the kink ) is excited , which removes energy from the translation component",
    ". if the initial kinetic energy is less than the amount lost to the oscillatory mode , the kk  pair can not escape to infinity .",
    "if the @xmath12 , they will escape to infinity but with reduced speed and with oscillations superimposed .",
    "he also derived the first cc model for this phenomenon , and used it in a formal calculation to determine  @xmath13 in agreement with his numerical observations .",
    "the shape mode is an eigenfunction for the linearization of equation   about the kink solution  , and is given by @xmath14 and oscillates with frequency @xmath15 .",
    "sugiyama based his cc ode for this system on the ansatz @xmath16 it leads to a two degree - of - freedom hamiltonian system for the evolution of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the ode system that arises is somewhat complicated,@xcite but its fundamental features are captured by the simpler model system    @xmath19    [ ccode ]    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , plotted in figure  [ fig : phaseplane](a ) .",
    "this conserves an energy @xmath22 the term @xmath23 is a potential energy describing the interaction of the two kinks , and was essentially derived by kudryavtsev.@xcite for large @xmath24 , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 vanish , so that the kink and antikink centers @xmath27 move at constant speed .",
    "the most important feature , for our purposes , is the phase diagram for @xmath24 when @xmath28 , shown in figure  [ fig : phaseplane](b ) .",
    "the trajectories are level sets of the energy @xmath29 , with @xmath30 on bounded orbits , a separatrix orbit with @xmath31 and unbounded orbits for @xmath32 .",
    "we denote the separatrix orbit by @xmath33 , and note it is an even function of time .",
    "subsystem , separatrix given by thick line . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : inout ] shows that this model qualitatively captures much of the dynamics of solitary wave collisions in  .",
    "observe , however , a few fundamental differences .",
    "while both systems conserve energy , in extended system  , radiation ( phonons ) can carry energy away from the immediate vicinity of the kinks , effectively adding dissipation .",
    "this can be seen in the figure , where only solutions that escape after four or fewer collisions are plotted . in ode  ,",
    "all solutions escape except for a set with measure zero , while for the pde , a significant fraction of solutions are trapped , due to energy loss to radiation .",
    "the radiation also steals some energy from solutions that do escape , so that @xmath34 even at the maxima of the resonance windows .    also in 1979 , ablowitz , kruskal , and ladik reported on a series of numerical experiments for a few different nonlinear klein - gordon equations of the form @xmath35 , including the @xmath0 equation and the sine - gordon equation.@xcite .",
    "their numerical results were similar to sugiyama s but the paper ends with an observation which was to prove important : on certain velocity intervals below @xmath13 , the kink and antikink eventually separate , instead of forming a bound state as seen by kudryavtsev ( from their references , it seems they had not seen sugiyama s work at this point ) . when the initial velocity is 0.3greater than @xmath13the final velocity is 0.135 .",
    "however , when the initial velocity is 0.2less than @xmath13 , the final velocity is @xmath36 .",
    "they conclude `` the reason for the apparent ` resonance ' between these interacting aperiodic waves and the radiation is not yet fully understood . ''    in 1983 , campbell et al.@xcite performed a more systematic numerical sweep of initial velocities and found significantly more detailed structure .",
    "their calculation revealed the black curve and the leftmost nine blue curves in figure  [ fig : inout ] .",
    "the black curve shows the final velocities of all the solutions that escape after exactly one collision , i.e.  those with initial speed above @xmath13 , which they estimate numerically to be 0.26 .",
    "the blue curve shows the final velocities of those with exactly two collisions .",
    "they called this phenomenon the _ two - bounce resonance_.    the first question is what is the difference between solutions in one two - bounce window and those in the next . a good way to understand the solutions",
    "is to fit the numerical solution to the ansatz  , and plot the approximate values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is done in figure  [ fig : pde_x_a ] for five increasing initial velocities .",
    "subfigure  ( a ) shows a collision leading to capture ; subfigures  ( b ) and  ( d ) show solutions from the first two two - bounce windows ; ( c )  shows a solution from a three - bounce window ; ( e )  shows a one bounce solution with @xmath37 .",
    "the number of oscillations of @xmath18 is the same for all initial velocities in a given window and increases by one from one window to the next .",
    "let @xmath38 be the period of the shape oscillation and @xmath39 be the time interval between the two collisions for the @xmath40 in the @xmath41th window at which @xmath42 is maximized , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicated in subfigures  ( b ) and  ( d ) .",
    "we remark that the nonlinear projection   is singular when @xmath45 , because the coefficient of @xmath18 then vanishes,@xcite in which case the fitting algorithm fails .    treating the numerical results as laboratory data , campbell et al .",
    "reasoned there should be a relation of the form @xmath46 which they confirm by least - squares fitting the data to a line .",
    "they conjectured that at the first collision , the kink loses energy to the shape - mode oscillation , and that , if the timing is right on the second collision , the shape mode returns enough energy to the propagating mode to allow escape .",

    "campbell , as well as peyrard , looked at a variety of @xmath0-like equations .",
    "they demonstrated that , at least for the systems they considered , the resonance phenomenon was only present when the linearization around the kink possesses an internal mode.@xcite of particular interest is a study by fei et al.@xcite which considers the sine - gordon equation perturbed by a small localized defect , @xmath53 they find that kink solutions impinging on the defect show a behavior very similar to that seen in figure  [ fig : inout ] .",
    "they derive a cc system similar to system   where @xmath18 now measures the amplitude of a mode localized in neighborhood of the defect .",
    "they use conservation of energy to derive an implicit formula for @xmath54 and apply campbell et al.s reasoning to fit the time between collisions to the period of the secondary oscillator .      beginning in 2004 , goodman and haberman",
    "published a series of papers explaining the chaotic scattering in detail by reducing the cc ode system to a discrete - time iterated map , called a separatrix map or scattering map.@xcite this was first done@xcite for the system studied by fei,@xcite because the the cc ode system for equation   has a small parameter  @xmath55 that can be used in a perturbation analysis .",
    "explicit formulas were found to approximate the critical velocities and the two- and three - bounce resonance , eliminating the need for data fitting as in equation  . over subsequent papers,@xcite the derivation of the map was streamlined and applied to other solitary waves systems and the model system  .",

    "we wish to design a surface such that a ball confined to roll along that surface satisfies equations of motion similar to system  .",
    "we derive the evolution equations corresponding for motion along a general surface and then design a surface that gives the desired dynamics .      consider the behavior of a point particle of mass @xmath89 confined to a surface @xmath90 and moving under the influence of constant gravity in the @xmath91-direction , and ignoring any friction or other dissipative mechanisms .",

    "we will say a `` bounce '' occurs when the ball reaches a minimum in the longitudinal direction .      to account for experimental energy loss",
    ", we include a viscous damping force @xmath109 , which modifies the equations of motion to : @xmath110 in goodman , holmes , and weinstein@xcite , a dissipative correction to system   is derived to account for the effect of radiative damping in nonlinear wave collisions .",
    "it adds a term like @xmath111 to the left - hand side of equation  .",
    "this damping term is strongly localized in @xmath24 , only applying when the kink and antikink are close together , and nonlinear in @xmath112 so that small radiation damps very slowly . both types of dissipation alter the fractal structure displayed by the ode system , as seen in figure  [ fig : damping ] , but their effect is rather different .",
    "the localized damping preserves much more of the fine structure of the chaotic scattering , whereas the viscous damping destroys almost everything but the two - bounce resonance windows .",
    "their behavior for @xmath10 near @xmath13 is also quite different , with viscous damping reducing the final speed of solutions in the two - bounce solutions much more than the localized damping .",

    "numerical experiments were used to both verify that system   could reproduce the dynamics demonstrated by solitary wave collisions .",
    "these produced the expected results , so we proceeded with laboratory experiments .",
    "to test experimentally whether the physical system modeled by   displays chaotic scattering , we needed to fabricate a surface satisfying  . the surface was milled out of high - density urethane foam using a three - axis mill in the fabrication laboratory of the njit department of architecture .",

    "<S> we describe a simple mechanical system , a ball rolling along a specially - designed landscape , that mimics the dynamics of a well known phenomenon , the two - bounce resonance of solitary wave collisions , that has been seen in countless numerical simulations but never in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a brief history of the solitary wave problem , stressing the fundamental role collective - coordinate models played in understanding this phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the equations governing the motion of a point particle confined to such a surface and then design a surface on which to roll the ball , such that its motion will evolve under the same equations that approximately govern solitary wave collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we report on physical experiments , carried out in an undergraduate applied mathematics course , that seem to verify one aspect of chaotic scattering , the so - called two - bounce resonance .    * solitary waves are solutions to partial differential equations that maintain their spatial profile while moving at constant speed . </S>",
    "<S> a wide variety of systems display a behavior called chaotic scattering when two such waves collide . </S>",
    "<S> the two waves may bounce off each other one or more times before escaping to infinity , or they may capture each other and never escape . the number of collisions and the final speed of those that separate depends in a complex way on their initial speeds . to our knowledge , this process has never been observed in a laboratory experiment involving solitary waves . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is described well by a small finite - dimensional system of ordinary differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> we describe an experiment , a ball rolling on a specially designed surface , that obeys the same system of ode . </S>",
    "<S> we report on laboratory experiments demonstrating that the experimental system has similar dynamics to the solitary wave collisions . * </S>"
