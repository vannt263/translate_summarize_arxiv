    "understanding the ecological implications of infectious disease is one of a few long - lasting problems that still remains challenging due to their inherent complexities@xmath0 .",
    "pathogen - mediated invasion is one of such ecologically important processes , where one invasive species carrying and transmitting a pathogen invades into a more vulnerable species .",
    "apparent competition@xmath1 , the competitive advantage conferred by a pathogen to a less vulnerable species , is generally accepted as a major force influencing biodiversity . due to the complexities originating from dynamical interactions among multiple hosts and multiple pathogens ,",
    "it has been difficult to single out and to quantitatively measure the effect of pathogen - mediated competition in nature . for this reason ,",
    "pathogen - mediated competition and infectious disease dynamics in general have been actively studied with theoretical models@xmath2 .",
    "theoretical studies of ecological processes generally employ deterministic or stochastic modeling approaches . in the former case ,",
    "the evolution of a population is described by ( partial- ) differential or difference equations@xmath3 . in the latter case ,",
    "the population is modeled as consisting of discrete entities , and its evolution is represented by transition probabilities .",
    "the deterministic modeling approach has been favored and widely applied to ecological processes due to its simplicity and well - established analytic tools@xmath3 .",
    "the applicability of the deterministic approach is limited in principle to a system with no fluctuations and no ( spatial ) correlations , e.g. , a system composed of a large number of particles under rapid mixing .",
    "the stochastic modeling approach is more broadly applicable and more comprehensive , as the macroscopic equation naturally emerges from a stochastic description of the same process@xmath4 . while being a more realistic representation of noisy ecology , the stochastic approach has a downside : most stochastic models are analytically intractable and stochastic simulation , a popular alternative , is demanding in terms of computing time .",
    "nonetheless , the stochastic approach is indispensable when a more thorough understanding of an ecological process is pursued .",
    "the role of stochastic fluctuations has been increasingly appreciated in various studies of the spatio - temporal patterns of infectious diseases such as measles@xmath5 , pertussis@xmath6 and syphilis@xmath7 .",
    "there has been an escalating interest in elucidating the role of stochastic noise not only in the studies of infectious disease dynamics but also in other fields such as stochastic interacting particle systems as model systems for population biology@xmath8 , the stochastic lotka - volterra equation@xmath9 , inherent noise - induced cyclic pattern in a predator - prey model@xmath10 and stochastic gene regulatory networks@xmath11 .",
    "here we investigate the effects of noise on pathogen - mediated competition , previously only studied by deterministic approaches .",
    "in our previous work@xmath12 we developed an experimental system and a theoretical framework for studying bacteriophage - mediated competition in bacterial populations .",
    "the experimental system consisted of two genetically identical bacterial strains ; they differed in that one strain was a carrier of the bacteriophage and resistant to it while the other strain was susceptible to phage infection .",
    "based on the _ in vitro _",
    "experimental set - up , we constructed a differential equation model of phage - mediated competition between the two bacterial strains .",
    "most model parameters were measured experimentally , and a few unknown parameters were estimated by matching the time - series data of the two competing populations to the experiments ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the model predicted , and experimental evidence confirmed , that the competitive advantage conferred by the phage depends only on the relative phage pathology and is independent of other phage and host parameters such as the infection - causing contact rate , the spontaneous and infection - induced lysis rates , and the phage burst size .",
    "here we examine if intrinsic noise changes the dynamics of the bacterial populations interacting through phage - mediated competition , and more specifically if it changes the validity of the conclusions of the deterministic model .",
    "the phage - bacteria infection system is modeled and analyzed with two probabilistic methods : ( i ) a linear fokker - plank equation obtained by a systematic expansion of a full probabilistic model ( i.e. , a master equation ) , and ( ii ) stochastic simulations .",
    "both probabilistic methods are used to identify the source of noise and assess its magnitude , through determining the ratio of the standard deviation to the average population size of each bacterial strain during the infection process .",
    "finally stochastic simulations show that the conclusions obtained from the deterministic model are robust against stochastic fluctuations , yet deviations become large when the phage are more pathological to the invading bacterial strain .",
    "illustrations of phage - mediated competition obtained from _ in vitro _ experiments ( symbols ) and a deterministic model ( lines ) .",
    "the phage infection system consists of two genetically identical bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria ( bb ) and the bacteriophage bpp-1 ( @xmath13)@xmath12 . a gentamicin marker ( gm ) is used to distinguish the susceptible bacterial strain ( bbgm ) from the phage - carrying bacterial strain ( bb::@xmath14 ) . as time elapses ,",

    "after a sufficiently long time , compared to the typical time scale of infection processes , all surviving bacteria are lysogens , which undergo the process of growth and spontaneous lysis . as it is a simple birth - death process with a positive net growth rate , the magnitude of noise asymptotically converges to a rather small constant value .",

    "thus the probabilistic model of phage - mediated competition in bacteria confirms that the quantitative amount of phage - mediated competition can still be predictable despite inherent stochastic fluctuations , yet deviations can also be large , depending on the values of phage pathologies .",
    "here we assumed that the bacterial growth rates and lysis rates are identical in the two strains . relaxing this assumption has a drastic simplifying effect as the steady state is determined solely by the net growth rates of the two strains .",
    "regardless of initial conditions in the generalized infection system , all bacteria that survive after a massive phage infection process are lysogens , so long as the phage - infection is in action on both bacterial strains . if the net growth rates of two strains are such that @xmath210 , asymptotically bacterial strain 1 will outnumber strain 2 , regardless of phage pathologies and initial population sizes .",
