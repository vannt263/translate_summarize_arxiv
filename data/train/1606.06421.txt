    "as is well - known , following the pioneer work on providing a @xmath5-approximate solution for max - cut problem @xcite , the semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxation technique has been playing a great role in approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems and nonconvex quadratic programs ; see for example , @xcite .",
    "this paper is to present a surprise case where the sdp relaxation misleads the approximation in both theory and computation .",
    "consider the @xmath1-ball ( @xmath6 ) constrained weighted maximin dispersion problem : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are given @xmath3 points , @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the @xmath1-norm of @xmath12 .",

    "@xcite proposed the first approximation algorithm for solving ( p ) . however , their approximation bound is not so clean that it depends on the optimal solution of the sdp relaxation .",
    "fortunately , when @xmath13 , the approximation bound reduces to @xmath14 very recently , the above approximation bound ( [ bd ] ) is established for the special case @xmath15 based on a different algorithm @xcite . but",
    "further extension to ( p ) with @xmath16 remains open @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that , by removing the sdp relaxation from haines et al.s approximation algorithm @xcite and simply replacing the optimal solution of the sdp relaxation with a scalar matrix , the approximation bound ( [ bd ] ) becomes to be satisfied for ( p ) . it is the sdp relaxation that makes the whole approximation algorithm not only loses the theoretical bound ( [ bd ] ) but also performs poorly in practice .",

    "in this section , we present haines et al.s randomized approximation algorithm @xcite based on sdp relaxation .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that lifting @xmath26 to @xmath27 yields the sdp relaxation for ( p ) : @xmath28 since it is assumed that @xmath2 , the above ( sdp ) is a convx program and hence can be solved efficiently @xcite .",

    "we remove the sdp relaxation from algorithm 1 and then replace the optimal solution @xmath52 with the scalar matrix @xmath53 .",
    "it turns out that our new algorithm just uniformly and randomly pick a solution from @xmath54 , which is a set of @xmath55 points on the surface of the unit @xmath1-ball .",
