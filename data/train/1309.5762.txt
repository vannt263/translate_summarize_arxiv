    "networks present a natural way of representing complex systems having many components and inter - component relationships .",
    "a network may represent a social , biological or a technological system .",
    "networks in real life display certain properties such as _ power law of degree distribution _ and _ small world phenomena_. another such property is the _ community structure _ ,",
    "i.e. , the presence of either overlapping or non - overlapping groups of nodes having dense connections internally .",
    "there are many algorithms in the literature for finding non - overlapping communities , e.g. , the _ hierarchical clustering algorithm _ , the _ girvan - newman algorithm _ and _ modularity maximization_. most of these algorithms exploit the _ structural properties _ of a network , such as the existence of an edge between two particular vertices",
    ". however , there can be many _ behavioral properties _ associated with each node in a network such as purchasing habits in transactional data , and in the context of our experiments , movie ratings or celebrity following by the users in an online social network .",
    "although there are many existing papers  @xcite @xcite that compare different community detection methods , a comparative study of behavioral property based community detection and structural property based community detection has not been done in the literature to the best of our knowledge .",
    "all of the algorithms mentioned above only try to optimize one metric using only single source of information .",
    "we also try a new approach to use both behavioral and structural information to get better performance in both _",
    "modularity _ and _ like - mindedness _",
    "metrics.*/    at this point ,",
    "let us introduce the notations and _ goodness metrics _ that we would use in the paper to compare different community detection algorithms .",
    "let @xmath0 be an unweighted ( i.e. , each edge having weight @xmath1 ) undirected graph ( representing a network ) whose vertex set is @xmath2 . since the graph represents a social network , we assume that the graph is sparse , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "each vertex @xmath4 is associated with a behavioral vector @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 .",
    "the behavioral vector and its dimension depends on a particular dataset being used .",
    "for example , the ratings given by a user on a movie rating website ( with some default rating being given to those movies he has not rated ) can be his behavioral vector , the dimension of which is the number of movies available for rating . a similarity metric @xmath7 is a distance measure between the vectors @xmath8 and @xmath5 representing the behavior of a pair of vertices @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "examples of such distance measures are _ cosine similarity _ , _ manhattan distance _ , _ euclidean distance _ and _ squared euclidean distance_. throughout this paper , we use cosine similarity @xmath10 as the distance measure .",
    "let @xmath11 be a partition of @xmath12 , each representing a set of vertices ( community ) in a community structure having @xmath13 communities .",
    "* modularity * @xcite is a well - known measure to capture the notion that a good community structure should have denser connections inside the communities , compared to the connections in - between communities .",
    "the modularity @xmath14 of the set of communities @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fraction of @xmath18 edges with both its vertices in the same community @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the fraction of @xmath18 edges with at least one vertex in community @xmath19 .    * like - mindedness * @xcite is a recent measure to capture the notion that members of a good community should share similar type of interests .",
    "the _ like - mindedness _ @xmath21 of the set of communities @xmath15 is defined as the average of all intra - community vertex pair similarities . in other words , @xmath22 , where the boolean function @xmath23 is @xmath1 if and only there exists a community @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .    * our contributions :",
    "* our main contribution of this paper is a comparative study of the existing behavioral property based and structural property based community detection methods using goodness metrics _ modularity _ and _ like - mindedness_. moreover , we have introduced two new algorithms _ modified louvain method _ and _ like - mindedness maximization _ , and compared those against the existing ones .",
    "the modified louvain method tries to achieve a community structure with approximately the highest modularity and reasonably good like - mindedness , whereas the like - mindedness maximization algorithm tries to maximize the like - mindedness of the identified community structure .",
    "we have also suggested the usage of one algorithm over another based on the dataset and the purpose of community finding .",
    "* organization of the paper : * in section [ sec : algorithms ] , we give a brief description of the existing community detection algorithms that we have chosen for comparison . in section [ newalgorithms ] , we describe the _ modified louvain method _ and _ like - mindedness maximization _ algorithms . in section [ sec : dataset_and_setup ] , we describe the dataset and the filtering criteria applied on the dataset to obtain the graphs on which we apply the community detection algorithms .",
    "the performance of the algorithms is compared in section [ results ] , which concludes with a discussion on the scenarios where it is useful to apply one of the algorithms considered here .",
    "hierarchical clustering is a bottom - up approach in which one starts with having each vertex belonging to @xmath12 in its own community . in each subsequent step ,",
    "pairs of communities are merged till there is only one cluster left .",
    "the pair of communities that gives the minimum value of a pre - defined linkage criterion ( defined below ) is selected for being merged in each step . in this agglomerative approach",
    ", we get a hierarchy of communities , often visualized as a dendrogram .",
    "there are a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithms depending on two parameters : a _ similarity metric _ between each pair of vertices and a _ linkage criterion_. as mentioned before , we use cosine similarity as the similarity metric throughout this paper .",
    "the linkage - criterion defines the similarity between a pair of communities @xmath26 and @xmath27 as a function of the pair - wise similarities of the members of the communities . in table",
    "[ tab : clustering_linkages ] , the linkage criteria commonly used by hierarchical clustering algorithms are summarized . in this paper , we evaluate the performance of the hierarchical clustering algorithms using each of these linkage criteria , each of which requires @xmath28 time to produce the complete hierarchy of communities .",
    "calculate edge betweenness for all edges in the network .",
    "+    girvan and newman  @xcite proposed a top - down algorithm in which they focused on edges that are least central , i.e. , the edges belonging to @xmath29 that are most  between \" communities .",
    "the _ edge betweenness _ of an edge @xmath30 is defined as the sum of the weighted number ( defined below ) of shortest paths passing through @xmath31 .",
    "if there are @xmath13 distinct shortest paths between @xmath32 and @xmath33 for a pair of vertices @xmath9 , each of the shortest paths connecting them is counted as @xmath34 . by progressively removing the edge",
    "@xmath30 having the highest edge - betweenness among all edges at the time of its removal , one is left with the communities as connected components of the graph .",
    "the running time of this method is @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 on a sparse graph .",
    "one pitfall of this algorithm is the amount of costly calculations involved , namely the calculation of the shortest paths between pairs of vertices .",
    "this is due to the fact that the edge betweenness of all the existing edges might need to be recalculated in an iteration in the worst case .",
    "however , if the graph is already disconnected ( either from the start or after the removal of an edge ) , the recalculation can be limited only to the connected component from which an edge has been removed .",
    "initialization : assign each node to its own community .",
    "+    as defined in the introduction , the modularity @xmath14 of a set of communities @xmath15 is defined as the fraction of `` within - community '' edges minus the expected value for the same if edges were distributed at random .",
    "@xmath14 always lies in the range @xmath37 .",
    "it is positive if the number of edges within groups exceeds the number expected on the basis of chance .",
    "for example , @xmath38 in a completely random graph .",
    "given a graph , finding a partition that maximizes the modularity is known to be an np - hard problem @xcite . as a result , all practical algorithms for modularity maximization employs some approximate optimization methods such as greedy algorithm , simulated annealing or spectral optimization . in this paper , we use louvain method @xcite which is one of the most popular and fastest method for modularity maximization .",
    "louvain method is a greedy algorithm in which we start with a community structure in which each node is its own community . in each step , we identify if shifting a vertex @xmath39 to any of its neighbor s community leads to an increase in modularity",
    ". if there is such an increase , we place @xmath39 in the community for which the increase is maximum .",
    "the steps are executed till there is no further improvement possible by shifting any vertex to any of its neighbor s communities .",
    "the running time of this method is estimated to be @xmath40 on sparse graphs .",
    "the method of using modularity maximization to identify a community structure has a few drawbacks .",
    "first , it suffers from resolution limit  @xcite , i.e. , as the network size increases , the ability to identify smaller communities by this method decreases .",
    "secondly , there may be a huge number of partitions , each very different from the others , having high but similar modularity values , all close to the absolute maximum @xcite .",
    "initialization : assign each node to its own community .",
    "+    we start with an identical copy @xmath41 of the graph @xmath0 . in each iteration of the louvain method ,",
    "the idea is to shift a node from its own community to another community to gain modularity . after the shift of a node , the community structure changes along with its like - mindedness . at this point",
    ", there might be pairs of nodes @xmath42 having equal or higher similarity than the current like - mindedness of the community structure . in the modified louvain method that we propose , we add each such pair to @xmath43 as additional edges .",
    "the intuition behind such addition of pairs to @xmath43 is to increase the like - mindedness of the community structure in the future iterations since such additional edges are likely to help the placement of a node to a community having similar nodes .",
    "however , it can be noted that the inclusion of such additional edges might lead to a drop in modularity of the set of communities w.r.t . the given network @xmath44 .    to implement the algorithm",
    ", we start with calculating the similarity of all @xmath45 pairs of vertices , and sort them in a descending order in @xmath46 time . calculating the like - mindedness score of the set of communities after a node has been shifted to a community @xmath47 from @xmath19 can be done in time proportional to @xmath48 . since it is estimated that the louvain method stops after at most @xmath40 iterations on sparse graphs ,",
    "the estimated time complexity of the modified louvain method is @xmath46 on sparse graphs .",
    "we should note that algorithms of _ louvain method _ and _ modified louvain method _ are applied in stages . in each stage",
    "the algorithm is run until there can be no improvement on _ modularity_. after a stage is over we build a new network with the current communities as nodes and the link weights between new nodes as the sum of the shared link weights between communities and the algorithm is continued until there is no improvement on new network also.*/    one general thing that can be learn from the algorithm is that not only we can increase _ like - mindedness _ but any metric whose requirement is to bring two specific nodes together .",
    "for example if we wanted two nodes with high neighborhood overlap together in the community division , we can just introduce an edge between them based on neighborhood overlap value instead of _ cosine similarity _ value .",
    "another possibility in which we may not want to have two nodes together we can break edges between similarly as above .    hence this algorithm can not only be used to increase _ modularity _ and _ like - mindedness _ , but for any number of metrics ( whose value can be improved by bringing specific nodes together ) by introducing new edges in the algorithm dynamically.*/      initialization : assign each node to its own community .",
    "+    we have observed from the dendograms of hierarchical clustering algorithms that an algorithm produces higher like - mindedness if small clusters are merged in the early iterations in order to avoid the creation of large heterogeneous communities .",
    "motivated by this fact , we design an algorithm in which we discourage the merging of two large communities at every iteration . at every iteration , we identify the pair of communities @xmath49 with the highest score @xmath50 .",
    "the left term is used to discourage the merging of two large communities , and the right term accounts for the average like - mindedness of the inter - community pairs from @xmath49 .",
    "a high value of the right term ensures that the like - mindedness of the set of communities after merging is high , since @xmath51 is the sum of the similarities of @xmath52 pairs of inter - community vertices belonging to @xmath19 and @xmath47 .    when @xmath19 and @xmath47 are merged , having a high inter - community similarity helps in obtaining a high like - mindedness score of the merged communities .",
    "* /    to implement the algorithm , we index each community by its smallest numbered node and maintain a @xmath53 matrix @xmath54 , which stores the pointers to the scores @xmath55 of the respective pair of communities @xmath49 .",
    "a max - heap @xmath56 is used to store the scores . when the pair of communities with the highest score has been identified from the heap and merged ,",
    "we need to update the entries corresponding to @xmath57 for all @xmath58 and @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "the update operation in a node requires the respective score to be recalculated , which takes a total of @xmath28 time over all iterations due to the fact that the similarity of a pair of vertices is used for score calculation only when they belong to two different communities being merged .",
    "since pairs of communities are merged in @xmath61 iterations , each of which requires @xmath61 update operations in a max - heap requiring @xmath62 time per operation , the running time of the algorithm is @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
