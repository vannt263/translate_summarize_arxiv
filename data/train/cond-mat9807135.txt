    "the use of three - pulse fwm , polarization @xcite and phase sensitive measurements of the nonlinear polarization @xcite , and non - degenerate transient fwm @xcite has led to effects beyond the mean - field approximation for exciton interaction and beyond the markovian approximation for dephasing .",

    "polarization - mixing in the nonlinear optical response is caused by excitation of two excitons of opposite spins which first occur in second order of the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the mean - field description which treats the interaction between excitons to first order in the coulomb interaction can account for neither the polarization mixing nor the formation of bound biexcitons .",
    "this point was clearly demonstrated by combescot and combescot @xcite who had stressed the importance of bound and unbound biexciton states for the excitonic ac - stark shift as well as polarization effects @xcite .",
    "the formation of para - biexcitons with singlet spin - states for the electrons and holes is one aspect of polarization - mixing which is most likely to be dominant for near resonant excitations of the fundamental exciton states .",
    "moreover , even in the absence of bound biexcitons , the correlation in the continuum of two - exciton scattering states is also important @xcite .    in studying the optical processes in semiconductor systems , while much can be learned from ensembles of non - interacting atomic transitions @xcite interacting with the radiation field or interacting localized ( dense ) two - level systems @xcite , the strong interaction and close proximity of the electrons in semiconductors provides a distinct avenue for new physics .",
    "it is well known that many - body effects lead to a renormalization of the external field ( local - field effects ) as well as to a renormalization of the interband transition energies ( self - energy effects ) , depending sensitively on the density and dynamics of the surrounding electron - hole pairs @xcite . in the linear response regime , these effects assume quantitative importance @xcite .",
    "however , the nonlinear properties of semiconductors in the weak nonlinear regime and in the high - excitation regime constitute challenging problem , where the electron interaction physics must be added to carrier non - equilibrium and physics of quantum optics .    in the low - density or weakly nonlinear regime , i.e. , to third - order in the external field ,",
    "the dynamics of the semiconductor for near resonant excitation of the fundamental exciton resonances can be formulated in terms of a set of effective dynamical equations for the exciton polarization with nonlinear exciton - exciton interaction and space filling effects , which have been derived from the semiconductor bloch equations ( sbe ) @xcite .",
    "these effective equations provide a useful and physical picture of the origin of the nonlinearities and the observed phenomena , for example in the theory of the four - wave - mixing @xcite , photon echo @xcite or the rabi - oscillations in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "being within a mean - field description , the effective equations can provide no more information than the full semiconductor bloch equations in the mean - field approximation .",

    "it was first shown in the equation - of - motion method by axt and stahl @xcite and later in a diagrammatic approach by maialle and sham @xcite that the semiconductor bloch equations form a closed set of equations for the density matrix elements for any given order of the external field , depending on the initial state , which is usually the vacuum state of the electron - hole pairs .",
    "the so - called dynamics - controlled truncation scheme @xcite provides a starting point for a microscopic theory of the polarization effects and has been applied to up to fifth - order processes @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of biexcitonic effects for actual applications is mostly treated in a restriction to bound - state contributions and a _ single _ two - exciton state contribution @xcite or perturbation theory in the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the solution for the third - order susceptibility is inextricably bound to the solution of the four - particle problem .    in this paper , we give a microscopic theory of exciton interaction effects in nonlinear optical processes based on the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the detailed account provides the derivation behind our results published earlier @xcite .",
    "the theory recovers the established mean - field results in the literature and formulates the rest of the interaction effects , termed correlation , in a concise manner .",
    "particularly striking is the resulting equation of motion for the third - order nonlinear optical response shown to be driven by a number of terms with clearly identified physical origins : ( 1 ) phase - space - filling corrections , which are due to the pauli - blocking of electrons and holes , ( 2 ) exciton - exciton mean - field interaction , and ( 3 ) the correlation term which is expressed as a two - exciton force - force correlation function .",

    "the correlation function approach gives a unified description of all correlation effects .",

    "we conclude with a summary of our theory and with a brief outline of future applications in section [ section6 ] .",
    "we take as the fundamental approximation that , in the absence of the light - matter interaction , the hilbert space of the semiconductor model consists of disconnected subspaces , which can be labeled according to the number of electron - hole ( eh ) pairs in the many - particle states .",

    "the spin - orbit interaction usually splits off a valence - band with total angular - momentum @xmath13 and is neglected throughout this investigation .",

    "such a step would be lost in a common approximation which restricts from the start to one or two biexciton states .",
    "the use of the subspaces of different exciton numbers as disconnected is implicit in previous works @xcite .",
    "the disconnectedness is an approximation because states with different exciton numbers can be connected by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the most important consequence is the neglect of the electron - hole pair fluctuations which affects the ground state and the dielectric screening of the coulomb interaction . in other words ,",
    "we define the ground state of the semiconductor as a vacuum state with respect to the exciton annihilation @xmath17 which means that no electron - hole pairs are present in the semiconductor ground state .",
