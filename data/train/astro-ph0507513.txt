    "of course this is a rough estimate , since the distribution of the gas is unknown , but it is consistent with values derived in other powerful radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "it shows that we are dealing with a clumpy medium in the central region of 3c  293 .",
    "in paper 1 we presented evidence for a fast outflow of neutral hydrogen gas in 3c  293 .",
    "figure [ fig : hiab ] ( from paper 1 ) shows the broad but shallow hi  absorption , mainly blueshifted w.r.t . the systemic velocity , that represents this fast outflow of hi .",
    "this absorption is detected against the central radio continuum using the 20 mhz band at the wsrt , but due to the low spatial resolution of the wsrt we are not able to locate the region in the inner radio structure from which the hi  outflow originates .    in @xcite we made a gaussian fit to this broad hi  absorption and derived a fwhm of @xmath55 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the centre of this gaussian fit is @xmath56 km  s@xmath0 blueshifted from the deepest , narrow hi  absorption feature , which traces quiescent gas likely located in an extended hi  disk @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the broad , blueshifted hi  component look similar to those of the broad component of the ionized gas observed in region e0 .",
    "a comparison between the two is shown in figure [ fig : hioiiplot ] ( from paper 1 ) .",
    "region e0 therefore appears to be the most likely location for the fast hi  outflow .",
    "the fact that the radio continuum is strongest in region e0 further strengthens this conclusion .",
    "the observed outflow of hi  can not be associated with the outflow of ionized gas that we see in region e2 , since no strong radio continuum is detected in region e2 . moreover , at the resolution of the wsrt observations , the outflow would appear not coincident with the nucleus but displaced with respect to it .",
    "_ the similarity between the characteristics of the hi  outflow and the ionized gas outflow in region e0 suggests that they likely originate from the same driving mechanism . _",
    "if the broad component of the hi  absorption is indeed located against the region e0 , we can derive a new value for the hi  column density .",
    "the peak intensity of the bright radio emission in region e0 in the merlin map of figure [ fig : slitposition ] is 1.29 jy .",
    "therefore , the optical depth that the broad hi  absorption feature has if it is located in region e0 is @xmath57 .",
    "this corresponds to column densities of the outflowing hi  gas of @xmath58 @xmath59 assuming @xmath60 k. this value for the column density likely represents a lower limit , as in the extreme conditions under which these fast outflows occur the @xmath61 is likely ( much ) higher ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the outflowing hi  gas extends over the same region as the fast outflow of ionized gas , the hi  column in front of the radio plasma will extend over @xmath62 kpc .",
    "the mean density of the neutral gas involved in the fast outflow will therefore be @xmath40 @xmath14 , which is comparable to the densities of @xmath63 @xmath14 that @xcite found for hi  clouds that are falling onto the agn .",
    "however , given the very low filling factor that we derive for the ionized gas ( section [ sec : mass ] ) , the neutral gas will most likely also be locked up in a clumpy medium with locally much higher densities .",
    "if the outflowing hi  gas extends over the same region as the fast outflow of ionized gas in region e0 we derive a total hi  mass of @xmath64 @xmath3 involved in the fast outflow .",
    "although uncertainties are large ( mainly due to the uncertainty in the exact location and extent of the hi  outflow and due to the unknown spin temperature of the gas ) , the bulk of the outflowing gas nevertheless appears to be in a cold , neutral state and only a minor fraction is ionized .",
    "emission line in region e0 and hi  absorption profile ( inverted ) plotted in one image.,width=302 ]",
    "the long slit spectra presented in this paper show complex kinematics of the ionized gas in the radio galaxy 3c  293 , in particular along the position angle of the inner radio jets . at a number of locations we find outflows of ionized gas . the broader and most blueshifted gas - component , that we identify with a fast ( @xmath7 km  s@xmath0 ) outflow of ionized gas , is detected in the region e0 , close to the brighter radio emission found along the jet .",
    "this is intriguing and suggests that the presence of the radio jet may play a role in producing the outflow .",
    "the total mass of warm gas involved in the fast outflow is @xmath65 @xmath3 .",
    "there are more regions in which complex kinematics of the ionized gas are seen , although less extreme than what we detect in region e0 .",
    "in addition to this , one of the most interesting results obtained is the similarity in the kinematic properties between the ionized gas outflow in the region e0 and the outflow of neutral hydrogen presented in paper 1 . _",
    "this suggest that the two outflows are coming from the same region ( that would therefore be about 1 kpc from the nucleus ) and that they are likely driven by the same mechanism . _",
    "the total hi  mass of @xmath66 @xmath3 involved in the outflow shows that most of the outflowing gas is in its neutral state and that only a small fraction is ionized .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss some of the possible mechanisms that can cause such ( off - nuclear ) outflows , focusing in particular on the case of the region e0 , for which detailed information could be derived from the optical data .",
    "although the scenario of a jet - ism interaction appears to be the most likely mechanism for the fast outflow in region e0 , other mechanisms are also possible .",
    "we also briefly discuss what could be the cause for the milder outflows observed in other regions across 3c  293 .",
    "here we consider three possible mechanisms to explain the detected gas outflows , in particular the fast outflow detected in region e0 .",
    "as explained in section [ sec : radioaxis ] , there are other regions in which complex kinematics of the gas , possibly connected to outflows , are seen .",
    "however , the gas kinematics observed in the other regions are not as extreme as in region e0 .",
    "the propagating radio jet , responsible for the fast outflow in region e0 as explained above , likely carries enough energy to also cause outflows in the regions other than e0 .",
    "this is an appealing scenario , in particular since the complex kinematics are observed along the inner radio axis .",
    "the fact that the broad component of the emission - line gas ( the component that represents the ionized gas outflows ) is blueshifted w.r.t .",
    "the narrow component on the eastern side and redshifted on the western side ( in case the asymmetric emission - line profile in regions w1 and w2 represents a real outflow and is not the effect of observational line - of - sight effects as discussed in section [ sec : radioaxis ] ) , implies that the radio jet is approaching on the eastern side and receiding on the western side .",
    "however , in region e2 so far no radio continuum has been detected ( see section [ sec : radioaxis ] ) , although it is the region in between the bright inner radio jet and the bright outer radio lobe .",
    "this could mean that the radio jet is propagating more efficiently in this region and it might suffer from doppler de - boosting .",
    "something similar likely happens in the region between the core and the region e0 as observed with very high resolution vlbi imaging @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the inner jet represent re - started activity ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the radio continuum in between the inner jet and the outer lobe has faded away .",
    "this last explanation could resemble the case of centaurus  a. as in 3c  293 , also in centaurus  a a so called inner - filament of ionized gas with very complex kinematics @xcite is located outside the inner bright radio lobe ( the lobe that can be considered to be the result of the most recent activity ) , but about 2 kpc from the much fainter large - scale jet @xcite . in the case of centaurus",
    "a it has been proposed that the large velocities shown by the gas are still created by the strong instabilities produced by the propagation of the jet in the past ( especially in the transition region between the inner and the outer lobe ) .",
    "a similar scenario could apply to the outflow observed in region e2 in 3c  293 .",
    "using similar arguments to those used for region e0 , the outflow in region e2 , although it appears to have broken through the ionized disk of the galaxy , is still not spread widely enough that it can be explained by a fossil wind from the post - starburst stellar population found by @xcite .",
    "also , from both our optical spectra as well as the uv - data from @xcite , there is no indication that a substantially younger stellar population or hii  region is present in region e2 .",
    "therefore it is not likely that the outflow in region e2 is driven by stellar winds .",
    "an agn - wind is not likely strong enough to explain the outflow in region e2 , since the outflow seems to be too extreme for that .",
    "however , for the outflow in region e1 and in particular regions w1 and w2 ( assuming the outflow is real in these western regions and not a result of observational line - of - sight effects as discussed in section [ sec : radioaxis ] ) we can not discard an agn - wind as the possible driving mechanism with the available data .",

    "<S> using long slit emission - line spectra we detect a fast outflow of ionized gas , with velocities up to 1000 km s@xmath0 , in the nearby powerful radio galaxy 3c  293 ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fast outflow is located about 1 kpc east of the nucleus , in a region of enhanced radio emission due to the presence of a distorted radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> we present results that indicate that this fast outflow is caused by a jet - ism interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the outflowing ionized gas are very similar to those of a fast outflow of neutral hydrogen gas in this galaxy , suggesting that both outflows are the result of the same driving mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> while the mass of the outflowing ionized gas is about @xmath2 @xmath3 , the total hi  mass involved in the neutral outflow is about @xmath4 higher ( 10@xmath5 @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that , despite the high energies that must be involved in driving the outflow , most of the gas remains , or becomes again , neutral . </S>",
    "<S> other outflows of ionized gas , although not as pronounced as in the region of the enhanced radio emission , are also seen in various other regions along the axis of the inner radio jets . </S>",
    "<S> the regular kinematics of the emission - line gas along the major axis of the host galaxy reveal a rotating ionized gas disk 30 kpc in extent .    </S>",
