    "it is well known that all galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) host multiple ( at least two ) stellar populations ( see gratton et al .",
    "2012 ; piotto et al .",
    "2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "this result has been deduced mainly from the general presence of the so - called c@xmath1n , o@xmath1na , and mg@xmath1al anticorrelations .",
    "first - generation ( fg ) stars display normal na ( and al ) abundances ( i.e. , typical of halo field stars ) , while second - generation ( sg ) stars - which may have additional subpopulations - show na ( and al ) enhancements .",
    "these sg additional subpopulations of stars are also characterized by he overabundances that change from cluster to cluster ( e.g. , milone et al .",
    "the presence of first- and second - generation stars in gcs has been clearly traced - using both spectroscopic and/or photometric data - in the various evolutionary sequences , from the main sequence up to the more advanced evolutionary stages ( e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "2001 ; carretta et al . 2009",
    "; milone et al . 2012 ; marino et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , as initially noticed by norris et al .",
    "( 1981 , see also gratton et al .",
    "2010 ) , there are claims concerning the paucity ( or lack ) of sg stars along the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) of some clusters .",
    "if confirmed , this occurrence would represent a challenge for stellar evolution and the formation and evolution models of these complex stellar systems ( charbonnel et al .",
    "2013 ; cassisi et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "recent spectroscopic observations of agb stars in the metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ) gc ngc 6752 ( campbell et al .",
    "2013 ) have found no na - rich sg - agb stars in this cluster .",
    "@xmath3 ) . ]",
    "campbell et al . (",
    "2013 ) have explained these puzzling observations as due to the fact that all sg stars do not ascend the agb ( agb - manqu stars ) .",
    "they suggest that a stronger mass - loss in sg horizontal branch ( hb ) stars could explain their observations , and that agb - manqu stars may be very common in metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) galactic gcs .",
    "@xmath4 ) gc 47 tuc but they argue that the high metallicity leads to a different hb morphology ( predominantly red ) with an insignificant population of hot hb stars and failed agb stars , which likely make up the missing na - rich agb in ngc 6752 ( and m 13 ) . ]",
    "the na - poor nature of all agb stars analyzed in ngc 6752 ( also in m 13 and m 62 ) poses an apparent problem for stellar evolution .",
    "this difficulty arises because synthetic hb models of ngc 6752 , based on canonical - i.e. , without a strong mass - loss efficiency during the core he - burning stage - hb stellar models , do not predict the observed lack of sg - agb stars .",
    "more recently , cassisi et al . (",
    "2014 ) have critically discussed such a mass - loss scenario during the core he - burning stage .",
    "they show that the required mass - loss rates are much higher than any of the current theoretical and empirical constraints , and that if all sg hb stars do not climb the agb it would be virtually impossible to reproduce the number ratio of agb to hb stars ( the r@xmath5 parameter ) in ngc 6752 and a few other clusters with similar / dissimilar observational properties .",
    "thus , at present there is no simple explanation for the apparent lack of sg - agb stars in these metal - poor gcs .    here",
    "we report sg - agb stars in the gc m 13 - a twin of ngc 6752 - and another three gcs ( m 5 , m 3 , and m 2 ) of similar metallicity but with distinct observational properties in terms of hb morphology and age . for this",
    ", we combined the h - band abundances measured by the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ; majewski et al .",
    "2015 ) and the most recent ground - based photometry of these gcs .",
    "the c and n abundances are significantly affected by the occurrence of both the first dredge - up during the early rgb and by non - canonical extra - mixing processes after the rgb bump ( e.g. , cassisi & salaris 2013 ) .",
    "thus , for the present analysis we decided to analyze the abundances of mg , al , na , and o which are barely - if at all - affected by these mixing processes during the rgb and agb stages in the evolution of low - mass stars .",
    "the apogee survey observed ten northern gcs , covering a range of metallicity [ fe / h ] from @xmath6 down to @xmath7 , including cluster members with well - characterized stellar parameters and abundances from existing high - resolution optical spectra , as well as many additional cluster giant stars currently lacking such detailed abundances ( mszros et al .",
    "2015 ) . the stellar parameters and chemical abundances of nine elements ( fe , c , n",
    ", o , mg , al , si , ca , and ti ) for 428 cluster star members in these ten gcs have recently been reported by us ( mszros et al . 2015 ) .",
    "we used photometry and theoretical isochrones to constrain the effective temperature ( @xmath8 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we then used an independent semi - automated method for precise ( up to the @xmath100.1 dex level ) elemental abundance determination from the high - resolution ( @xmath1022500 ) and high - quality ( signal - to - noise @xmath11 70 per pixel ) @xmath12-band ( @xmath101.51.7 @xmath13 m ) spectra ( mszros et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the apogee abundances are measured from neutral lines of fe , al , mg , etc . ; the @xmath12-band single - ionized lines are not detected in metal - poor gc giants .",
    "the apogee @xmath12-band data offer several advantages with respect to previous optical spectroscopic studies of gc giants : i ) they enable us to analyze these ten clusters in a homogeneous way ( covering almost the full extent of the rgb ) ; ii ) nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects on the spectral lines of neutral species such as fe , al , mg , etc .",
    "are less important than in the optical range because in the @xmath12-band these lines are formed deeper in the atmosphere ( see sect .",
    "4 ) ; and iii ) the increased number of apogee stars compared to the literature permit us to discover more al - rich stars , making the mg  al plane clearer in the apogee data than in previous studies .",
    "ground - based @xmath14 photometry is available for six of the ten gcs observed by apogee .",
    "the ground - based photometry is taken from the private collection by p. stetson , which is based upon a large corpus of the most recent observations obtained mainly from public astronomical archives .",
    "our @xmath15 and @xmath16 magnitudes are precise to the level of @xmath170.002 and @xmath170.001 mag , respectively , for stars in the range ( @xmath18 ) of the apogee observations ( see e.g. , stetson et al .",
    "we made use of the ground - based @xmath14 photometry mentioned above to construct several color ",
    "magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for each gc observed by apogee and separate the agb from the rgb stars .",
    "we find that the combination of the @xmath15@xmath21 , i@xmath1(u - i ) , and @xmath19@xmath22 cmds gives an efficient rgb / agb separation ( figure 1 ; see below ) .    in mszros",
    "et al . ( 2015 ) we used an extreme - deconvolution ( xd ) method to identify fg and sg stars in the al  mg distributions and to assign cluster membership . briefly",
    ", the xd method fits the distribution of the elemental abundances as a sum of k gaussian populations .",
    "similar to k - means ( steinhaus 1956 ) , the number of populations to fit is an input to the xd method and was fixed to two populations ( fg and sg ) .",
    "this xd method was applied to each gc in our sample by using [ mg / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] , as well as only [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] ( taking into account the individual abundance errors ) , and we found that mg and al drive the population membership in the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) gcs ( see mszros et al .",
    "2015 for more details ) .",
    "the exact [ al / fe ] boundary between fg and sg stars is thus provided by the xd method and may differ slightly from one cluster to another .",
    "we note that ( in the four gcs with sg - agb stars identified , see below ) , this basically translates into fg and sg stars displaying roughly [ al / fe ] @xmath17 0.50 dex ( al - poor ) and [ al / fe ] @xmath23 0.50 dex ( al - rich ) , respectively .",
    "thus , we combined our fg and sg star classification ( mainly driven by the al abundances ) with the @xmath15@xmath21 , @xmath24@xmath21 , and @xmath19@xmath22 cmds .",
    "we note that fg- and sg - agb stars display [ al / fe ] @xmath17 0.50 dex ( al - poor ) and [ al / fe ] @xmath23 0.50 dex ( al - rich ) , respectively .",
    "the only exception is the m 2 agb star 2m21331521 - 0049516 , which displays a slightly lower al abundance ( [ al / fe ] = 0.37 dex ) and is classified as a sg star by the xd method .",
    "the cmds for four gcs ( m 13 : [ fe / h]@xmath25 - 1.53 , 67 stars ; m 5 : [ fe / h]@xmath25 - 1.29 , 103 stars ; m 3 : [ fe / h]@xmath25 - 1.50 , 46 stars ; and m 2 : [ fe / h]@xmath25 - 1.65 , 18 stars ) contain sg al - rich agb stars ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the agb stars are clearly separated from those of the rgb in the @xmath15@xmath21 , @xmath24@xmath21 , and @xmath19@xmath22 cmds ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the only exceptions are : i ) four m 13 agb stars ( the brightest ones near the tip of the rgb ; all of them fg ) , which are not clearly separated from the rgb stars in the @xmath19@xmath22 cmd but are in the @xmath24@xmath21 and @xmath15@xmath21 cmds ; ii ) two m 3 agb stars ( both sg ) that lie on the red rgb tail in the @xmath15@xmath21 cmd but are clearly identified as agb stars in the other two cmds ; and iii ) one m 2 agb star ( an fg one ) that is not well separated from the rgbs in the @xmath24@xmath21 and @xmath19@xmath22 cmds but is in the @xmath15@xmath21 cmd .",
    "we identify a total of 4 , 5 , 3 , and 2 sg al - rich agb stars in m 13 , m 5 , m 3 , and m 2 , respectively .",
    "table 1 lists the agb stars ( both fg and sg ) identified together with some relevant observational information such as the apogee al ( and o where available ) abundances and the na and o abundances from the literature.m ) in the apogee @xmath12-band spectral range , which is too weak in the spectra of low - metallicity gc giant stars for reliable abundances to be derived . ]",
    "the al  o anticorrelation is clearly seen in our apogee data for all clusters ( figure 2 ) and the sg al - rich agb stars are among the most o - poor stars @xmath260.20.3 dex between the apogee and literature o abundances is just the consequence of using different solar abundance scales ( mszros et al .",
    "using older solar abundance scales , our apogee o abundances would be in good agreement with the literature ; in particular the [ o / fe ] abundances in sg al - rich agb stars would be @xmath270.0 . ] , as expected .",
    "only a few ( 5 out of 14 ) of the sg al - rich agb stars have na abundances from optical spectroscopy available in the literature ( table 1 ) . remarkably , all of them are na - rich ( [ na / fe ] @xmath10 0.30.6 dex ; see figure 3 ) , supporting their identification as truly sg - agb stars .",
    "another indication of the na - rich nature of the identified sg - agb stars is offered by the ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) pseudo - cmds ( where @xmath28 ; monelli et al .",
    "it has been clearly shown by monelli et al .",
    "( 2013 ) that the @xmath20 index is very sensitive to any change in the relative distributions of cno elements , and , since sg stars are n - rich / o - poor / na - rich / al - rich with respect fg stars , it is a powerful tool for tracing the distribution of fg / sg stars along the rgb and agb evolutionary stages . in order to find an independent confirmation of present results , we show in figure 4 the ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) pseudo - cmd of all the gcs in our sample .",
    "we find that ( on average , with some exceptions ) both rgb and agb stars in our gc sample are separated in the ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) pseudo - cmds depending on their al content ( fg or sg ) .",
    "the sg al - rich stars generally display higher values of the @xmath20 index , which corresponds to a population with higher na content ( monelli et al .",
    "for example , at least two sg - agb stars in m 13 ( 2m16412975@xmath263631563 and 2m16414398@xmath263622338 ) lie in the region occupied by the most extreme na - rich population defined by monelli et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "finally , another interesting feature of figure 1 is a hint for the presence of a splitting ( i.e. , different photometric sequences ) along the agb between the fg- and sg - agb stars in m 13 and m 5 .",
    "the number of stars , however , is small and this agb splitting is not seen in m 3 and m 2 , where we have observed even fewer stars . in the cmds ,",
    "the m 13 and m 5 sg - agb stars seem to define bluer ( and/or brighter ) photometric sequences than the fg ones , as expected .",
    "the non - detection of sg - agb stars in several metal - poor gcs ( such as ngc 6752 , m 13 , and m 62 ) from previous optical spectroscopic surveys may be just coincidental ( bias in the sample selections , small stellar samples ) or due to the non - use of recent ( and precise ) optical photometry and appropriate combinations of several cmds for efficient rgb / agb separation .",
    "for example , we have several m 13 agb stars ( 9 fg and 1 sg ; see table 1 ) in common with johnson & pilachowski ( 2012 ) .",
    "these authors used the @xmath19@xmath29 cmd ( with coordinates and @xmath19 photometric data by cudworth & monet 1979 ) to separate the rgb from the agb stars .",
    "they are not able to efficiently discriminate the rgb from the agb ( especially near the tip of the rgb ) because the width of the rgb in their @xmath19@xmath29 cmd is much wider than ours ( when using our more recent photometric data ) . indeed ,",
    "the only m 13 sg - agb star ( 2m16414398@xmath263622338 ; table 1 ) in common with us was wrongly classified by these authors as an rgb star",
    ". our agb identifications in m 5 are fully consistent with the previous optical studies using recent photometric data .",
    "the previous optical works in m 3 did not attempt any rgb / agb separation from appropriate combinations of several cmds , while no m 2 agb star in our sample has been previously studied ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the lack of na - rich sg - agb stars in ngc 6752 ( campbell et al . 2013 ) is puzzling ( also in m 62 but only six agb stars were analyzed ; lapenna et al . 2015 ) . here",
    "we report for the first time sg - agb stars in the gc m 13 ; a twin of ngc 6752 with very similar hb morphology , metallicity , and age .",
    "an alternative explanation for the na - poor character of all agbs surveyed in ngc 6752 ( as well as for the previous non - detection of na - rich sg - agbs in several metal - poor gcs ) is the fact that nlte effects in agb stars may be larger than in rgb stars .",
    "this would underestimate more severely the correct na abundances in the agb stars ( lapenna et al . 2015 and references therein ) .",
    "higher nlte effects in agb stars are suggested by the differences ( up to @xmath100.10.2 dex ) in the fe ( and ti ) abundances measured from neutral and single - ionized lines in the agb stars , which otherwise are negligible in the rgb stars ( e.g. , ivans et al . 2001 ; lapenna et al .",
    "for example , the fe abundances derived from optical neutral lines in agb stars are systematically @xmath100.10.2 dex lower than in the rgb stars .",
    "as we mentioned above , the apogee abundances are measured from neutral lines and we find no significant differences for the fe ( al , mg , o ) abundances in the agb and rgb stars ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this confirms that the @xmath12-band spectral lines are formed deeper in the atmosphere and nlte effects on the neutral lines of fe , al , mg , etc .",
    "are less severe than in the optical domain .",
    "the @xmath12-band thus opens up a new ( and safer ) window to systematically study the agb and rgb stellar generations in galactic gcs .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results provide plain evidence of the fact that sg stars are present along the agb of metal - poor galactic gcs .",
    "this supports the present generation of canonical hb stellar models in terms of their capability to properly reproduce the observed distribution of fg and sg stars during both the core and shell he - burning phases .",

    "<S> galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are known to host multiple stellar populations : a first generation with a chemical pattern typical of halo field stars and a second generation ( sg ) enriched in na and al and depleted in o and mg . </S>",
    "<S> both stellar generations are found at different evolutionary stages ( e.g. , the main - sequence turnoff , the subgiant branch , and the red giant branch ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non detection of sg asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in several metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) gcs suggests that not all sg stars ascend the agb phase , and that failed agb stars may be very common in metal - poor gcs . </S>",
    "<S> this observation represents a serious problem for stellar evolution and gc formation / evolution theories . </S>",
    "<S> we report fourteen sg - agb stars in four metal - poor gcs ( m 13 , m 5 , m 3 , and m 2 ) with different observational properties : horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology , metallicity , and age . by combining the h - band al abundances obtained by the apogee survey with ground - based optical photometry </S>",
    "<S> , we identify sg al - rich agb stars in these four gcs and show that al - rich rgb / agb gc stars should be na - rich . </S>",
    "<S> our observations provide strong support for present , standard stellar models , i.e. , without including a strong mass - loss efficiency , for low - mass hb stars . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , current empirical evidence is in agreement with the predicted distribution of fg and and sg stars during the he - burning stages based on these standard stellar models . </S>"
