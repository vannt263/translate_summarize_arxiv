    "the nonlinear partial differential equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a real - valued spatially periodic function and @xmath3 denotes its mean , was recently introduced in @xcite as an integrable equation arising in the study of the diffeomorphism group of the circle .",

    "the closest relatives of ( [ much ] ) are the camassa - holm equation @xcite @xmath4 and the hunter - saxton @xcite equation @xmath5 in fact , each of the equations ( [ much])-([hs ] ) can be written in the form @xmath6 where the operator @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 in the case of ( [ much ] ) , @xmath9 in the case of ( [ ch ] ) , and @xmath10 in the case of ( [ hs ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we will refer to equation ( [ much ] ) as the @xmath0-camassa - holm ( @xmath0ch ) equation .",
    "equations ( [ much])-([hs ] ) share many remarkable properties : ( a ) they are all completely integrable systems with a corresponding lax pair formulation , a bi - hamiltonian structure , and an infinite sequence of conservation laws , see @xcite .",
    "( b ) they all arise geometrically as equations for geodesic flow in the context of the diffeomorphism group of the circle @xmath11 endowed with a right - invariant metric @xcite .",
    "( c ) they are all models for wave breaking ( each equation admits initially smooth solutions which break in finite time in such a way that the wave remains bounded while its slope becomes unbounded ) cf",
    ". @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of the camassa - holm equation is that it admits peaked soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions ( called peakons ) are traveling waves with a peak at their crest and they occur both in the periodic and in the non - periodic setting . it was noted in @xcite that the @xmath0ch equation also admits peakons : for any @xmath12 , the peaked traveling - wave @xmath13 , where ( see figure [ peakon.pdf ] ) @xmath14\\ ] ] and @xmath15 is extended periodically to the real line , is a solution of ( [ much ] ) .",
    "note that the height of the peakon @xmath16 is proportional to its speed .    if waves such as the peakons are to be observable in nature , they need to be stable under small perturbations .",
    "the stability of the peakons is therefore of great interest .",
    "since a small change in the height of a peakon yields another one traveling at a different speed , the correct notion of stability here is that of _ orbital stability _ : a periodic wave with an initial profile close to a peakon remains close to some translate of it for all later times .",
    "that is , the shape of the wave remains approximately the same for all times .",
    "the camassa - holm peakons are orbitally stable in the non - periodic setting @xcite as well as in the periodic case @xcite . in this paper , we show that the periodic @xmath0ch peakons given by ( [ varphipeakon ] ) are also orbitally stable :    [ thm_stabintro ] the periodic peakons of equation ( [ much ] ) are orbitally stable in @xmath17    an outline of the proof of thereom [ thm_stabintro ] is given in section [ outlinesec ] , while a detailed proof is presented in section [ proofsec ] .",

    "+    [ peakon.pdf ] the periodic peakon @xmath18 of the @xmath0ch equation .",
    "there are two standard methods for studying stability of a solution of a dispersive wave equation .",
    "the first method consists of linearizing the equation around the solution . in many cases ,",
    "nonlinear stability is governed by the linearized equation . however , for the @xmath0ch and ch equations , the nonlinearity plays the dominant role rather than being a higher - order perturbation of the linear terms .",
    "thus , it is not clear how to prove nonlinear stability of the peakons using the linearized problem .",
    "moreover , the peakons @xmath16 are continuous but not differentiable , which makes it hard to analyze the spectrum of the operator linearized around @xmath19 .",
    "the second method is variational in nature . in this approach ,",
    "the solution is realized as an energy minimizer under appropriate constraints .",
    "stability follows if the uniqueness of the minimizer can be established ( otherwise one only obtains the stability of the set of minima ) . a proof of the stability of the camassa - holm peakons using the variational approach is given in @xcite for the case on the line and in @xcite for the periodic case .    in this paper , we prove stability of the peakon ( [ varphipeakon ] ) using a method that is different from both of the above methods . taking @xmath20 for simplicity , our approach can be described as follows . to each function @xmath21 , we associate a function @xmath22 of two real variables @xmath23 in such a way that the correspondence @xmath24 has the following properties :    * if @xmath2 is a solution of ( [ much ] ) with maximal existence time @xmath25 , then @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the maximum and minimum of @xmath29 at the time @xmath30 , respectively . * for the peakon , we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 for all @xmath33 with equality if and only if @xmath34 , see figure [ graphf.pdf ] . *",

    "the approach here is similar , but there are differences .",
    "the main difference is that in @xcite the function @xmath50 associated with a solution @xmath2 could be chosen to be independent of time , whereas here the function @xmath44 depends on time .",
    "indeed , our definition of the function @xmath51 involves the @xmath52-norm @xmath53 , which is not conserved in time . however , since this norm is controlled by the conservation law @xmath54 , we can ensure that it remains bounded for all times .",
