    "sizes , shapes and binding energies are fundamental characteristics of nuclei and reflect the basic properties of effective nuclear forces .",
    "the description of the generalized moments of the nuclear density distributions provides an important test for nuclear structure models .",
    "in particular , a description of ground - state properties of an isobaric sequence of nuclei tests the isovector channel of the effective nuclear force .",
    "the correct parameterization of this channel is essential for the description of structure phenomena in exotic nuclei far from @xmath2-stability . in the present study",
    "we analyze the sequence of @xmath0 nuclei : @xmath1n , @xmath1o , @xmath1f , @xmath1ne , @xmath1na , @xmath1 mg .",
    "experimental data on nuclear matter radii derived from the measured interaction cross section of these nuclei have been reported in ref .",
    "evidence has been found for the existence of a proton skin for @xmath1 mg and of a neutron skin for @xmath1n .",
    "the largest difference in radii ( @xmath3 fm ) has been reported for the mirror nuclei @xmath1o and @xmath1 mg .",
    "this last result has prompted several theoretical investigations , but the extremely small value for the matter radius of @xmath1o has not been reproduced in calculations which include the microscopic three - cluster model  @xcite , the hartree - fock model with skyrme interactions  @xcite , a single particle potential model  @xcite , and the shell - model  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data on interaction cross sections of @xmath0 isobars were also reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a variety of phenomenological and semi - microscopic models .    in the present analysis of the @xmath0 isobaric sequence",
    "we employ the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) theory .",
    "based on the relativistic mean - field theory and on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov framework , the rhb theory provides a unified description of mean - field and pairing correlations .",
    "it has been successfully applied in the description of nuclear structure phenomena , not only in nuclei along the valley of @xmath2-stability , but also of exotic nuclei close to the particle drip lines . in particular , applications relevant to the present study include : the halo phenomenon in light nuclei  @xcite , properties of light nuclei near the neutron - drip  @xcite , reduction of the spin - orbit potential in nuclei with extreme isospin values  @xcite , the deformation and shape coexistence phenomena that result from the suppression of the spherical n=28 shell gap in neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite , properties of proton - rich nuclei and the phenomenon of ground - state proton radioactivity  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic mean field theory is based on simple concepts  @xcite : nucleons are described as point particles , the theory is fully lorentz invariant , the nucleons move independently in mean fields which originate from the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "conditions of causality and lorentz invariance impose that the interaction is mediated by the exchange of point - like effective mesons , which couple to the nucleons at local vertices",
    ". the single - nucleon dynamics is described by the dirac equation @xmath4 @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the meson fields , and @xmath8 denotes the electromagnetic potential .",
    "@xmath9 @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the corresponding coupling constants for the mesons to the nucleon .",
    "the lowest order of the quantum field theory is the _ mean - field _ approximation : the meson field operators are replaced by their expectation values .",
    "the sources of the meson fields are defined by the nucleon densities and currents .",
    "the ground state of a nucleus is described by the stationary self - consistent solution of the coupled system of dirac and klein - gordon equations .",
    "in addition to the self - consistent mean - field potential , pairing correlations have to be included in order to describe ground - state properties of open - shell nuclei . in the framework of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model , the ground state of a nucleus @xmath12",
    "is represented by the product of independent single - quasiparticle states .",
    "these states are eigenvectors of the generalized single - nucleon hamiltonian which contains two average potentials : the self - consistent mean - field @xmath13 which encloses all the long range particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) correlations , and a pairing field @xmath14 which sums up the particle - particle ( _ pp _ ) correlations . in the hartree approximation for the self - consistent mean field ,",
    "the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov equations read @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the single - nucleon dirac hamiltonian ( [ statdirac ] ) , and @xmath17 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath18 has to be determined by the particle number subsidiary condition in order that the expectation value of the particle number operator in the ground state equals the number of nucleons .",
    "@xmath19 is the pairing field .",
    "the column vectors denote the quasi - particle spinors and @xmath20 are the quasi - particle energies .",
    "the rhb equations are solved self - consistently , with potentials determined in the mean - field approximation from solutions of klein - gordon equations for the sigma meson , omega meson , rho meson and photon field , respectively .",
    "the details of the ground - state properties of the @xmath21 isobaric sequence will depend on the choice of the effective nuclear interaction . in the last few years several new and more accurate parameter sets of meson masses and meson - nucleon coupling constants for the effective mean - field lagrangian have been derived . due to large uncertainties in the experimental data ,",
    "older effective interactions were not specifically designed to describe ground - state isovector properties .",
    "only more recently have isovector properties been included in the set of data on which the effective interactions are adjusted . in the relativistic mean - field model ,",
    "perhaps the most accurate set of meson masses and meson nucleon coupling constants is nl3  @xcite . in most recent applications of the rhb theory",
    "we have used the nl3 effective interaction for the mean - field lagrangian , and the pairing field has been described by the pairing part of the gogny interaction with the d1s parameter set @xcite .",
    "this force has been very carefully adjusted to the pairing properties of finite nuclei all over the periodic table . in particular , the basic advantage of the gogny force is the finite range , which automatically guarantees a proper cut - off in momentum space .",
    "the rhb equations are solved self - consistently , with potentials determined in the mean - field approximation from solutions of klein - gordon equations for the meson fields .",
    "the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov equations and the equations for the meson fields are solved by expanding the nucleon spinors @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the meson fields in terms of the eigenfunctions of a deformed axially symmetric oscillator potential .",
    "the calculations for the present analysis have been performed by an expansion in 12 oscillator shells for the fermion fields , and 20 shells for the boson fields .",
    "a simple blocking procedure is used in the calculation of odd - proton and/or odd - neutron systems .",
    "the blocking calculations are performed without breaking the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "a detailed description of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model for deformed nuclei can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figa ] we compare the rhb nl3+d1s binding energies of the @xmath0 nuclei ( @xmath1n , @xmath1o , @xmath1f , @xmath1ne , @xmath1na , @xmath1 mg ) with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is very good . the self - consistent rhb neutron and proton ground - state density distributions for the @xmath0 isobaric sequence are shown in fig .  [ figb ] .",
    "we will eventually compare the calculated radii with experimental values , but here we notice the trend : a pronounced proton skin is observed in @xmath1 mg , it slowly disappears and the proton and neutron density distributions are almost identical in @xmath1ne , the neutron skin develops and is very pronounced in @xmath1n .",
    "this trend is in complete agreement with experimental evidence for the existence of a proton skin for @xmath1 mg and of a neutron skin for @xmath1n  @xcite .",
    "the calculated ground - state quadrupole deformations of @xmath0 isobars are shown in fig .",
    "[ figc ] as function of the isospin projection @xmath24 . except for @xmath1ne and @xmath1na ,",
    "the @xmath0 nuclei are essentially spherical .",
    "@xmath1ne is strongly prolate deformed ( @xmath25 ) , and an oblate ground - state is calculated for @xmath1na ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the surface thickness and diffuseness parameters of the proton and neutron density distributions ( fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figd ] . the surface thickness @xmath27 is defined to be the change in radius required to reduce @xmath28 from 0.9 to 0.1 ( @xmath29 is the density in the center of the nucleus ) .",
    "the diffuseness parameter @xmath30 is determined by fitting the neutron density profiles to the fermi distribution @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the half - density radius .",
    "the surface thickness and diffuseness parameters quantify the proton and neutron skins : for @xmath1 mg @xmath33 fm , @xmath34 fm , and the corresponding diffuseness parameters @xmath35 fm , @xmath36 fm ; for @xmath1n @xmath37 fm , @xmath38 fm , @xmath39 fm , @xmath40 fm . for @xmath1ne",
    "the surface thickness and diffuseness parameters of the proton and neutron distributions are identical .",
    "the calculated radii are compared with experimental data  @xcite in figs .",
    "[ fige ] and [ figf ] . in fig .",
    "[ fige ] we display the nuclear matter radii ( left panel ) , and the differences between proton and neutron radii ( right panel ) of the @xmath0 nuclei as functions of the isospin projection @xmath24 .",
    "the theoretical values are in very good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the calculated matter radii reproduce the observed staggering between even and odd values of @xmath24 .",
    "the only serious discrepancy is @xmath1o : the calculated matter radius is 2.79 fm and the experimental value is 2.69(3 )  @xcite .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned in the introduction , several theoretical models have failed to reproduce this extremely small value for the matter radius of @xmath1o  @xcite , and it was also suggested that the reported experimental value should be reconsidered  @xcite .",
    "all theoretical calculations predict the matter radius in the interval between 2.77 fm and 2.83 fm , in agreement with the result of the present analysis .",
    "in fact , since most models predict over - binding for the o isotopes ( @xmath41o , and even @xmath42o , are bound nuclei in most model calculations ) , one would expect the theoretical value for the matter radius in @xmath1o to be smaller than the experimental one . with the exception of @xmath1o , also the calculated differences between proton and neutron radii ( right panel ) are in very good agreement with experimental data .",
    "in particular , the theoretical values agree with the large differences found in nuclei with a large excess of neutrons ( @xmath1n , @xmath43 fm ) or protons ( @xmath1 mg , @xmath44 fm ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ figf ] theoretical and experimental values are compared for the proton radii as function of the isospin projection @xmath24 ( left panel ) , and for the matter radii as function of the binding energy .",
    "we notice a very good agreement for all the proton radii .",
    "the rhb model also reproduces , with the above discussed exception of @xmath1o , the functional dependence of the matter radii on the binding energy of the @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "in this study we have applied the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory in an analysis of ground - state properties of nuclei that belong to the @xmath0 isobaric sequence .",
    "the nl3 effective interaction has been used for the mean - field lagrangian , and pairing correlations have been described by the pairing part of the finite range gogny interaction d1s . this particular combination of effective forces in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels has been used in most of our recent applications of the rhb theory .",
    "theoretical predictions for binding energies , neutron and proton ground - state density distributions , quadrupole deformations , nuclear matter radii , proton radii and differences between proton and neutron radii for @xmath1n , @xmath1o , @xmath1f , @xmath1ne , @xmath1na , and @xmath1 mg have been analyzed and compared with available experimental data .",
    "it has been shown that the nl3 effective force provides a very good description of the observed ground - state properties as function of the isospin projection @xmath24 .",
    "the results of the present analysis confirm that the isovector channel of the nl3 interaction is correctly parameterized and that this effective force can be used to describe properties of nuclei far from @xmath2-stability .    this work has been supported in part by the bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung under project 06 tm 979 , by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , and by the gesellschaft f \" ur schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) darmstadt .",
