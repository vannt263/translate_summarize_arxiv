    "the si(100 ) surface is one of the best examined , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically@xcite , semiconductor surfaces due to its great technological importance for semiconductor devices .",
    "leed experiments@xcite , x - ray diffraction measurements@xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite and surface core - level photoelectron diffraction experiments@xcite find down to temperatures of 90k that on the si(100 ) surface alternating buckled dimers in p(2@xmath22 ) or c(4@xmath22 ) structure are formed .",
    "these experimental findings are in agreement with those of various density functional calculations ( dft ) applying the local density approximation ( lda ) to a slab model of the surface@xcite . applying the lda to cluster models of this surface@xcite the energy difference between the buckled reconstruction and a reconstruction forming symmetric dimers is very small , so they can not draw a concluding result on the ground state structure .",
    "earlier work done with semi - empirical quantum chemical methods@xcite favours the asymmetric reconstruction as a closed - shell hartree - fock treatment@xcite does .",
    "including electronic correlations at the generalized valence bond level@xcite or within a configuration interaction ( ci ) approach@xcite yields a symmetrically dimerized ground state similar to the findings of unrestricted hartree - fock calculations@xcite .",
    "+ the wide spread density functional methods rely on the ground - state density and do not provide a many - body wave function . the electronic correlations are included implicitly only via the exchange - correlation functional . regarding the process forming a dimer on the surface",
    "the question arises whether dft can cope with bond breaking and bond formation . in the ideal si(100 ) surface each surface atom has two singly occupied @xmath3 hybrids ( see fig.[structure ] a ) . in a simple - minded picture",
    "the surface energy is lowered by reducing the number of singly occupied orbitals .",
    "a bond is formed between two surface atoms yielding the ( 1@xmath22 ) dimer structure .",
    "the nature of the bond can have two limiting cases : if a double - bond is generated between the two si atoms ( see fig.[structure ] b ) , this would lead to a closed - shell structure of the surface . or ,",
    "a single - bond is generated leaving on each surface atom a singly occupied orbital ( see fig.[structure ] c ) .",
    "the true electronic structure of the surface can only be solved within a multi - determinant approach , which can describe all configurations between the two limiting cases .",
    "a second advantage of this approach is that the ideal and reconstructed surface are described at the same level of accuracy because we apply no restrictions on the wave function as single - reference approaches do .",
    "up to now the multi - reference methods were applied to adsorption and diffusion processes of hydrogen on si(100)@xcite .",
    "the most sophisticated correlation method applied to the reconstruction itself is by jing and whitten@xcite who made a two - determinant ansatz at the mcscf level and perform a ci calculation using this reference .",
    "+ we want to present a multi - reference self - consistent field ( mcscf ) calculation for the ideal and reconstructed si(100 ) surface to cope with the difficult bond structure . to deal with the dynamical correlations we supplement it with a multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) calculation .",
    "in addition we perform lda and gradient corrected ( gga ) density functional calculations for a direct comparison . + the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we present the multi - reference methods and provide the technical details .",
    "the resulting wave function is discussed in sec.iii . in sec.iv",
    "we present the reconstruction energy , the geometry of the symmetric dimer and the question of dimer buckling .",
    "conclusion follows in sec.v .",
    "only closed - shell systems or high - spin open - shell system can be described within a single - determinant approach such as hartree - fock or single - reference configuration interaction ( ci ) methods to include correlations . in all other cases",
    "the suitable method is a multi - configuration self - consistent field ( mcscf ) approach .",
    "the wave function is written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a determinant built up from molecular orbitals and @xmath6 are the so - called ci - coefficients .",
    "the difference to a single - reference ci approach is that not only the ci - coefficients are optimized but also the coefficients of the orthonormal orbitals building up the @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the number of determinants involved in the mcscf should be small compared with conventional ci . in the case of the si(100 ) surface we select all possible determinants combining the four singly occupied @xmath3 hybrids to a singlet .",
    "in addition we reoptimize the closed - shell orbitals of the first layer to account for the influence of the reconstruction on the bulk .",
    "the electronic correlations treated by a mcscf ansatz are often called static correlations . + to describe the dynamical correlations we apply on top of the mcscf a multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) with single and double excitations .",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 numbers the occupied orbitals and @xmath10 and @xmath11 the unoccupied ones .",
    "the coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 are determined variationally in the mrci procedure .",
    "we restrict the dynamically correlated space to the surface orbitals .",
    "+ we perform all calculations with the quantum - chemical program package molpro94@xcite , only for the dft - calculations we use the latest version molpro96@xcite .",
    "the smallest possible cluster with one dimer is @xmath14 , the bulk - like bonds are saturated with 12 hydrogens . to test the influence of the bulk layers we perform calculations on @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the number of bulk layers increases .",
    "si distance in the bulk is taken from experiment ( 2.352 ) , the distance to the saturating hydrogen atoms is chosen equal to the one in @xmath17 ( 1.480 ) . in test calculations the geometry of the symmetric reconstruction",
    "is chosen such that all bonds have the bond length of the bulk . to test the interaction of the dimers we consider a @xmath18 cluster which contains two parallel dimers and @xmath19 which has two dimers in line .",
    "additionally we used a @xmath20 cluster with three parallel dimers .",
    "the final results are obtained from @xmath0 , which simulates six bulk layers and two dimers .",
    "all clusters are shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] .",
    "+ we apply a 4-valence - electron scalar - relativistic energy - consistent pseudopotential for si@xcite with the corresponding valence basis set@xcite .",
    "it is supplemented by various sets of polarization functions , which are optimized by performing correlated calculations for the free atom .",
    "for hydrogen we apply a minimal basis consisting of the fully contracted 1@xmath21 functions of dunning@xcite .",
    "for the ideal surface we perform a high - spin ( @xmath22 ) single - determinant hartree - fock calculation to generate the starting orbitals for the mcscf calculation in which the four singly occupied orbitals in the active space are combined to a singlet ground - state . in addition",
    "the closed - shell orbitals of the first bulk layer are reoptimized .",
    "one way to discuss the resulting orbitals is to calculate the natural orbitals which diagonalize the density matrix ( see table [ orbital ] ) .",
    "we find three quite close - lying orbitals two of which have binding and one has antibinding character .",
    "even the second antibinding one has a mean occupation of half an electron .    .[orbital]the",
    "mean occupation number of the natural orbitals and their binding character is shown both for the ideal and reconstructed surface . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the dynamical correlations reduce the dimer bond length by about 2% . compared with the dimer bond - length of the asymmetric dimer from different experiments ( bullock et al.@xcite 2.25 ; jedrecy et al.@xcite 2.32 ; aono et al.@xcite 2.4@xmath230.1 ; holland et al.@xcite 2.47 ; yang et al.@xcite 2.54 ; felici et al.@xcite 2.67 ) we agree quite well with the second and third measurement .",
    "lda - slab calculations ( see table [ lattsym ] ) yield a dimer bond length quite below the bulk value .      in this section",
    "we want to arise the question of the dimer buckling . up to now",
    "we allowed only for the symmetric reconstruction which maintains the local c@xmath24-symmetry .",
    "we test the buckling by lowering the symmetry in the @xmath25 cluster with the @xmath261d$ ] basis .",
    "we allow for a buckling angle @xmath27 and a displacement of the dimer parallel to the surface ( see fig .",
    "[ asym ] ) .",
    "the dimer bond length is fixed to the value obtained in the optimization of the symmetric case . in the mcscf and mrci treatment",
    "the symmetric dimer has the lowest energy contrary to the dft calculations where we find a buckling of 9@xmath28 in lda and of 8@xmath28 in gga .",
    "the energy gain is very small , i.e. , 0.031 ev in lda and 0.014 ev in gga . from this",
    "we can conclude that the used approximations to dft overestimate the electronic contribution to the buckling due to an overestimation of the closed - shell structure .",
    "+ the experimentally observed buckling could be driven by relaxation of the bulk atoms .",
    "although the @xmath25 cluster is quite small to resolve relaxations we performed some test calculations within this model .",
    "we allow for the first bulk layer atoms to relax in all directions , whereas we regard for the second bulk layer only a relaxation perpendicular to the surface ( see fig .",
    "[ asym ] ) . on the mcscf level ,",
    "where all orbitals are reoptimized we do not find any buckling although there is a significant relaxation of the first bulk layer atoms in the dimer direction of about 0.08  and of the second bulk layer atoms perpendicular to the surface of about 0.09 .",
    "the other relaxations are smaller by about one order of magnitude . from this",
    "we can conclude that in our cluster model the bulk relaxations do not drive the asymmetric buckling . + to account for the dimer interaction we regard the @xmath18 cluster with two dimers .",
    "we model the asymmetric p(1@xmath22 ) structure as well as the p(2@xmath22 ) structure with alternating buckled dimers . for fixed buckling angle the p(2@xmath22 ) structure",
    "is lower in energy than the asymmetric p(1@xmath22 ) structure , e.g. , for an angle of 2@xmath28 by 0.018 ev per dimer and for an angle of 10@xmath28 by 0.060 ev .",
    "but still the symmetric dimer is lowest in energy , also if we allow for the relaxations we determined in the @xmath25 cluster .",
    "this shows that the interaction of two dimers is not enough to stabilize a buckled structure .",
    "this is in contradiction to the lda cluster results from yang et al.@xcite who find a stable p(2@xmath22 ) structure in the @xmath18 cluster .",
    "+ our finding of a symmetric ground state is in agreement with all previous correlation calculations , which show that the proper treatment of the electronic correlations stabilize the symmetric reconstruction . we can exclude an asymmetric p(1@xmath22 ) structure , which lda slab calculations@xcite find about 0.1ev more stable than the symmetric one . as we can only calculate the interaction of two dimers",
    ", there is the possibility that the interaction of many dimers can yield a buckled ground state .",
    "but regarding the stm experiment of badt et al.@xcite , who find a buckled c(2@xmath24 ) structure at 90k , they claim that the buckling can be induced by a defect or a step at the surface .",
    "the defect - free surface is difficult to prepare , so the question of buckling of the si(100 ) surface is experimentally still not solved .",
    "+ to address the question of metallicity of the symmetric reconstructed si(100 ) surface , which is found in various dft calculations and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "[ ] , in a many - body description as applied here there can exist a gap due to electronic correlations in the symmetric reconstruction , too .",
    "but in principle the question of metallicity can not be solved in a cluster approach .",
    "we have performed mcscf calculations for the ideal and reconstructed si(100 ) surface . in both cases",
    "the many - body ground state is a singlet , but it can only be described by several determinants . on the reconstructed surface a dimer is formed .",
    "the bond structure is a mixture between a double - bond and a single - bond with two singly occupied orbitals . to account for",
    "the dynamical correlations we apply on top of the mcscf result a mrci calculation .",
    "determining the reconstruction energy we find good agreement with various lda slab calculations .",
    "the dimer bond length agrees better with experiment than the lda one .",
    "the asymmetric reconstruction is overestimated in the lda while our fully correlated treatment finds the symmetric dimer more stable regarding the electronic structure of one dimer and relaxations of the bulk atoms .",
    "the buckling observed in experiment can be due to a small concentration of defects on the si(100 ) surface .",
    "it is possible that an alternating buckled structure is induced by defects and persist down to low temperatures due to dimer interactions .",
