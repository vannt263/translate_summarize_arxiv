    "the main thrust of this work is to argue that , the portion of gws traveling inside the null cone of its source  commonly known as its tail  would give rise to a memory effect in even dimensions higher than @xmath20 . as we shall see , this phenomenon is intimately tied to the fact that the tail part of the minimally coupled massless scalar green s function in ds@xmath1 , for @xmath21 zero or a positive integer , is a spacetime constant .    one may ask why a 4d physicist should be interested in physics of other dimensions .",
    "one answer is that @xmath22 , the dimension of spacetime , may be viewed as a parameter in the equations of physics , including that of einstein gravity . by varying @xmath22",

    "an example is that of the tail effect itself : even though massless fields / particles propagate strictly on the light cone in 4d flat spacetimes , they no longer do so in @xmath20 and odd dimensions .",

    "specifically , the causal structure of the de sitter scalar green s function can be related to that of signals generated by an appropriately defined line source in the ambient flat spacetime .",
    "in addition , recent work @xcite has drawn connections between the ( better known ) gw memory effect in asymptotically minkowskian spacetime and the low frequency limit of the ward - takahashi identities obeyed by gw scattering amplitudes , which in turn is a consequence of the bondi - van der burg - metzner - sachs ( bms ) symmetry at null infinity . does an analogous relationship hold in cosmological spacetimes , or does it break down because the tail induced memory effect described here is timelike instead of null ?",
    "these questions have first been raised in @xcite , and subsequently in @xcite ; because it is one based on symmetry , it ought to be examined in all possible dimensions in order to understand the breadth of its validity .",
    "in  we work out einstein s equations with a non - zero cosmological constant , linearized about a de sitter background of dimensions greater or equal to four .",
    "we then express the metric perturbations as appropriate retarded green s functions convolved against the energy - momentum - shear - stress tensor of the source(s ) .",
    "following that , in  we take a detour to define the mass and pressure quadrupole moments of an isolated gw source in a spatially flat flrw universe , and then relate linear combinations of their time derivatives to the spatial - volume integral of the shear - stress of the same source .",
    "we then employ these results in  , and describe how the solutions laid out in  lead us to a linear gw memory effect exhibited by the tensor mode , after the source has settled down . in ",
    "we re - visit some results obtained in @xcite and comment on their implications for the linear gw memory effect in 4d cosmologies .",

    "<S> we argue that massless gravitons in all even dimensional de sitter ( ds ) spacetimes higher than two admit a linear memory effect arising from their propagation inside the null cone . </S>",
    "<S> assume that gravitational waves ( gws ) are being generated by an isolated source , and over only a finite period of time @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> outside of this time interval , suppose the shear - stress of the gw source becomes negligible relative to its energy - momentum and its mass quadrupole moments settle to static values . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate , the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gw contribution to the perturbation of any ds@xmath1 written in a conformally flat form ( @xmath2 )  after the source has ceased and the primary gw train has passed  amounts to a spacetime constant shift in the flat metric proportional to the difference between the tt parts of the source s final and initial mass quadrupole moments . as a byproduct , we present solutions to einstein s equations linearized about de sitter backgrounds of all dimensions greater than three . </S>",
    "<S> we then point out there is a similar but approximate tail induced linear gw memory effect in 4d matter dominated universes . </S>",
    "<S> our work here serves to improve upon and extend the 4d cosmological results of @xcite , which in turn preceded complementary work by bieri , garfinkle and yau @xcite and by kehagias and riotto @xcite . </S>"
