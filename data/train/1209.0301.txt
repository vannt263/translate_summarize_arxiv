    "recently , there has been a great deal of interest @xcite in studying various collective phenomena in dense quantum plasmas which are ubiquitous in a wide - range of physical systems , including compact astrophysical objects ( e.g. the cores of white dwarfs @xcite and neutron stars @xcite ) , giant planetary cores ( e.g. the interior of the planet jupiter @xcite , high - energy density compressed plasmas created by powerful laser beams @xcite , as well as semiconductors @xcite and metallic nanostructures @xcite for high - technological applications , table - top quantum free - electron lasers ( fel ) @xcite for producing coherent tunable x - rays and gamma rays , and quantum diodes @xcite , etc .",
    "quantum plasmas are usually composed of degenerate electron and nondegenerate ion fluids . since , in quantum plasmas the number density of degenerated electrons , @xmath0 , is rather high , the average inter - electron / ion distances @xmath1 can be comparable with the electron thermal de broglie wavelength , @xmath2 , which is much smaller than the landau length @xmath3 . here where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath5 the boltzmann constant , @xmath6 the thermal electron temperature , @xmath7 the planck constant divided by @xmath8 , @xmath9 the rest mass of the electron , and @xmath10 the electron thermal speed . in quantum plasmas ,",
    "the wavefunctions of degenerated fermionic ingredients ( electrons ) overlap giving rise to the fermi - dirac distribution function and density of states ( dos ) .",
    "in fact , the importance of the quantum electron degeneracy was recognized eighty years ago by fowler @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite in the study of non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic pressures for degenerate electrons that were required for setting up the hydrostatic stability of a gravitating star that eventually becomes a compact star called a white dwarf . clearly , in quantum plasmas , the equations of state ( eos ) significantly differ from classical plasmas where non - degenerate electrons obey the ordinary maxwell - boltzmann distribution function . in quantum plasmas , the electron and ion gamma factors ( which are defined as the ratio of the coulomb potential to the thermal energy of the plasma particles )",
    "are given as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , being smaller and much larger than unity , implying a weak correlation for degenerate electrons and strong correlations for non - degenerate ion fluids in the quasineutral plasma regime .",
    "the collective behavior of a quantum fermi plasmas with a statistical ensemble of degenerate electrons has been investigated in the pioneering papers of klimontovich and silin @xcite , and later by bohm and pines @xcite , who have used the quantum kinetic wigner and poisson equations to obtain the dispersion relation for quantum electron - plasma oscillations ( epos ) .",
    "the frequency spectra of the latter can be shown to be , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electron plasma frequency and @xmath15 is the fermi electron speed .",
    "the frequency spectra of quantum epos have also been derived @xcite from the quantum electron fluid equations @xcite , composed of the electron continuity , non - relativistic electron momentum equation including the quantum statistical pressure and the quantum recoil effect , and poisson s equation .",
    "on the other hand , in his classic experimental work , glenzer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have conclusively demonstrated the quantum mechanical collective effect by measuring the scattering of electromagnetic waves off the quantum epos in a high - energy density ( warm dense matter ) laboratory plasma .",
    "numerical analyses of poisson s equation and the nonlinear schrdinger equation for non - relativistic degenerate electron fluids revealed the formation of a dark soliton and two - dimensional quantized vortices @xcite , as well as nano - structures @xcite in quantum electron plasmas with immobile ions .    on the other hand ,",
    "inclusion of the ion dynamics leads to electrostatic oscillations ( esos ) supported by the restoring force due to the quantum statistical pressure , the quantum bohm force and the inertia of non - degenerate ions .",
    "by using poisson s equation , the momentum equation for non - relativistic degenerate inertialess electrons and the classical hydrodynamic equations ( the continuity and momentum equations ) for non - correlated ions , hass _ et al _ @xcite derived a modified korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation for small amplitude nonlinear ion oscillations in an unmagnetized quantum plasma .",
    "the kdv equation admits a localized solitary pulse as a stationary solution .",
    "large amplitude localized ion oscillations in a collisionless quantum plasma were investigated by many authors @xcite ignoring the ion correlation effects . the latter and the ion fluid viscosity",
    "have recently been incorporated in the small amplitude shock wave theory @xcite of ion oscillations in a quantum plasma .    in this paper , we present a theory for fully nonlinear nonstationary es ion shock waves in a quantum viscous plasma with mildly coupled degenerate electrons and strongly correlated ion fluids for a wide - range of the chandrasekhar s relativity parameter and the plasma atomic number . for our purposes , we use the hydrodynamic force balance ( the electric force balancing the gradient of the degenerate electron pressure , gradient of the potentials involving the electron - exchange and electron - correlations , the gradient of the bohm potential ) for inertialess electrons and the generalized viscoelastic ion momentum ( gvim ) equation , together with the ion continuity equation , invoking the quasi - neutrality approximation .",
    "the gvim equation contains the essential physics of the ion correlation decay rate , as well as of the ion fluid bulk and shear viscosities .",
    "when the electric force is eliminated from the gvim equation by using the electric field , from the momentum equation for inertialess degenerate electron fluids , we obtain a pair of equations exhibiting the coupling between the ion fluid velocity and the ion number density .",
    "the pair of equations are then numerically solved to study the dynamics of is ion shocks in planar as well as non - planar geometries .",
    "our numerical analysis exhibits distinguished features for the formation of es shock structures in different ion mass - density ranges which might play a very important role in acceleration of charged particles in dense quantum plasmas , such as those in the cores of white dwarf stars and in compressed plasmas created by intense laser and electron beams .",
    "we consider a fully - ionized quantum plasma composed of strongly correlated non - degenerate warm ion and mildly coupled degenerate electron fluids . since , the ion thermal energy is much smaller than the electron fermi - electron energy , we shall not consider quantum forces on the ion fluid .",
    "the viscoelastic hydrodynamic ( vehd ) model for such an electron - ion plasma is governed by a set of equations @xcite    @xmath16",

    "also , the total electron pressure , @xmath22 , consists of pressures due to the electron degeneracy , coulomb interaction , and electron - exchange interaction , respectively . the electron viscosity has been shown to become dominant only at much larger densities , such as in neutron - star crusts @xcite , hence , we will ignore it in the following analysis .",
    "it is also known that in quantum plasmas the electron - electron collisions are rare due to the pauli blocking - mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is convincing to only consider the ion - fluid viscosity effects in our model .",
    "we simplify the model by supposing that degenerate electrons are inertialess and the plasma is quasi - neutral , viz . @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath24 , and obtain    @xmath25 = \\left [ { { \\eta _ v}{\\nabla ^2}{\\bf{u } } + \\left ( { \\xi   + \\frac{{{\\eta _ v}}}{3 } } \\right)\\nabla ( \\nabla \\cdot{\\bf{u } } ) } \\right ] , \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath26 is the generalized plasma pressure .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to express all involved parameters in terms of the chandrasekhar s relativity parameter , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 gr/@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the normalizing plasma mass - density and number of nucleons per electron with @xmath31 and @xmath21 being the atomic weight and number , and @xmath32 is the electron relativistic fermi momentum .",
    "other quantities can be expressed in terms of the relativity parameter @xmath33 and the plasma atomic - number @xmath21 .",

    "variations of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite for various coupling parameter values .",
    "according to dewitt @xcite , the strongly coupled plasma is in liquid form for the range of the plasma ion coupling of @xmath45 to which we focus our attention in the following analysis .",
    "the plasma coupling factor , in terms of the relativity parameter for a typical white dwarf temperature of @xmath46 is approximately @xmath47 , valid for a wide ange of the plasma mass - density and atomic - number variations .",
    "the viscoelastic relaxation - time is directly related to the plasma viscosity via the following relation @xcite    @xmath48    where , @xmath49 is the free electron effective - mass .",
    "the viscoelastic relaxation time is thus given as the following , with the fitting constants presented in ref .",
    "@xcite    @xmath50    furthermore , ignoring the ion pressure compared to that of the electrons , we may write the plasma generalized pressure in terms of a generalized effective potential @xcite    @xmath51    with the effective plasma potential , defined as    @xmath52    where , @xmath53 . the dimensionless set of vehd equations , eqs .",

    "thus , the normalized equations , dropping the bar notation for simplicity , read    @xmath60 = \\eta\\left [ { { \\nabla ^2}{\\bf{u } } + \\frac{1}{3}\\nabla ( \\nabla \\cdot{\\bf{u } } ) } \\right ] . \\\\",

    "( [ rel ] ) we readily obtain the generalized dispersion relation    @xmath76    figure 2 depicts the linear dispersion of viscoelastic ion waves in a relativistically degenerate plasma and the variation of the phase - speed for different plasma mass density and atomic - numbers .",
    "figure 2(a ) reveals that the linear wave dispersion is fundamentally governed by the plasma mass density . below a critical plasma density ,",
    "a dispersion gap opens in the wave - number range , indicated for the thin curve in the plot .",
    "as the plasma density increases above the critical value , for a fixed plasma composition , the dispersion gap disappears , but there still exists a sharp discontinuity in the linear wave speed . also , as the plasma mass - density increases further this discontinuity disappears .",
    "such anomalous feature may be attributed to the interplay of strong plasma interactions and ion fluid couplings expected for a super - dense degenerate plasma .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the effect of the plasma composition on the linear wave dispersion .",
    "it is evident that in the small and long - wavelength limits , the linear wave speed is not affected by the change to plasma composition , while this is converse in the medium - wavelength region due to the presence of the mentioned discontinuity in the plasma wave speed .",

    "therefore , at this stage , we aim at numerical investigation of arbitrarily large amplitude nonlinear waves which can have fundamental importance in superdense astrophysical environments . in order to evaluate the nonlinear blast - waves in the laboratory frame , we solve the time - dependent vehd equations compliant with appropriate periodic boundary conditions for different independent fractional plasma parameter values , namely , the relativistic degeneracy parameter @xmath40 ( representing the plasma mass density , @xmath79 ) , and the plasma composition parameter , @xmath21 . for the the planar geometry ( viz .",

    "the results of simulation are depicted in figs . 3 and 4 for non - viscous ( @xmath82 ) and viscous ( @xmath83 ) quantum plasmas , respectively , for given initial plasma mass - density , temperature and composition relevant to typical white dwarf stars and cores of giant planets .",
    "figure 3 indicates the time evolution of ion density wave into the train of density humps with the time elapse .",
    "this is an example of ion wave breaking / steepening , arising from harmonic generation nonlinearity , where , the plasma dispersive effects are somewhat spreading the ion pulse , but not strong enough to allow the formation of a real solitary pulse .",

    "4 that the time evolution of the gaussian density and velocity profiles develop into shock - like structures with pronounced shock wave front steepened by further elapse of the simulation time .",
    "it is confirmed by fig .",
    "5 that for all the considered set of plasma parameters the gaussian perturbation profile develops into shock - like structures after enough elapsed simulation time , say ( @xmath86 ) . comparing different plots in fig . 5",
    ", we observe that an increase in both the plasma mass density and the atomic - number leads to an increase in the shock height and steepening of the shock front .",
    "remember that the maximum value of the relativistic degeneracy parameter , @xmath87 used in this simulation , corresponds to high electron / ion number density , @xmath88 , expected for white dwarf stars .",
    "the present simulation revealed that despite the significant effect of the temperature on the plasma coupling factor , @xmath84 , it has little effect on the viscosity parameters and the present study might be extended to the ( jupiter - like ) large planet cores and environments with high number densities and relatively low temperatures .",
    "figure 6 depicts the evolution of ion - momentum distribution from an initial gaussian profile in different plasma geometries .",

    "6(d ) we observe that the amplitude of nonlinear ion shock structures are relatively higher in the planar geometry with respect to other geometries , for a given set of fixed plasma parameters .",
    "different geometries than planar , like spherical and cylindrical , may be important in the study of physical mechanisms in stellar configurations and active galactic nuclei , for instance .",
    "the present findings reveal the fundamental effects of the plasma mass density and its composition on the formation and characteristics of blast - like ion - waves in dense quantum plasmas .",
    "furthermore , our study reveals that the characteristics of density perturbations and the formation of es ion shocks in the cores of white dwarf stars can be quite different from the existing shock - waves at the low density crust region .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a nonlinear theory for arbitrary large amplitude electrostatic planar and non - planar shocks in collisional quantum plasmas composed of mildly coupled degenerate electron fluid and strongly correlated non - degenerate ions for a wide range of the plasma mass density and atomic number .",
    "we have included the electrostatic and relevant pressure gradient , quantum forces and interactions on degenerate electron fluids , and have used the general vehd equations for non - degenerate ions to carry out laboratory - frame simulations in different geometries in order to deduce the complete picture of very large - amplitude electrostatic shock structures .",
    "the latter may exist in white - dwarfs , the active galactic nuclei or many other high density astrophysical environments such as neutron stars , pulsars and magnetars .",
    "it was found that that the increase / decrease in the ion charge state or atomic - number / mass - density would lead to stronger and steeper shock fronts in the relativistically degenerate viscous plasmas .",
    "it was also shown that the linear dispersion in such quantum plasmas exhibits anomalous features attributed to the strong fermionic interactions and ion fluid couplings . in conclusion , we stress that the present investigation of the formation of arbitrary large amplitude es ion shocks will play a very important role in acceleration of electrons and ions in relativistically degenerate quantum plasmas , which are ubiquitous in high - energy density compressed plasmas produced by intense short wavelength laser beams , as well as in planetary systems ( e.g. the giant jupiter ) and in super dense compact astrophysical objects ( e.g. white dwarf stars and magnetars ) .",
