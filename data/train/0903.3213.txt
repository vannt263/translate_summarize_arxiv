    "forbidden line intensity ratios from given species ( o@xmath0 , o@xmath1 , n@xmath0 , s@xmath0 ) have been widely used in the literature to derive average electron temperatures and densities in astrophysical nebulae .",
    "the method for measuring the electron temperature was suggested by @xcite while the idea of using the [ ] line intensity ratios to measure electron densities was suggested by @xcite and worked out quantitatively by @xcite for both [ ] and [ ] lines",
    ". an early review of these methods is given by @xcite .",
    "since then , intensity ratios for lines from many other species have been proposed and used .",
    "electron temperatures are sensitive to the intensity ratio of the auroral to the nebular components , for example , for the carbon - like 2p@xmath2 and the silicon - like 3p@xmath2 ions .",
    "a classical intensity ratio is that of [ ] @xmath3 .",
    "average electron densities are obtained , for example , from the nitrogen - like 2p@xmath4 and phosphorus - like 3p@xmath4 ions .",
    "intensity ratios , used very often , are those of [ ] @xmath5 and [ ] @xmath6 lines . with the development of infrared , ultraviolet and x - ray detectors , other pairs of lines",
    "have also been used .",
    "a comprehensive review on the subject is given in @xcite .",
    "in the traditional single aperture spectroscopic approach , one obtains a single spectrum of a given object and only one intensity ratio is measured .",
    "this has the obvious disadvantage of providing a single average property ( temperature and/or density ) for the object along the slit . with the development of two - dimensional spectroscopic devices such as the integral field units ( ifu ) and fabry - perot instruments , a new approach is possible as one can obtain simultaneously the average property along the line of sight for each point of the object on the sky , if the object is spatially resolved .    in this paper",
    "we present a method of transforming two images of density - sensitive emission lines into two other images , of high and low - density cloud emission .",
    "we demonstrate the method by applying it to two objects with extended nebular emission .",
    "we will not discuss the observations in great detail nor the physics of each object .",
    "the reader is referred to the papers in which the objects are discussed , for specific information .",
    "the focus of this paper is to present the method and show some results , for illustration only .",
    "the pair of [ ] @xmath76716/6731 lines is , perhaps , the most used density - sensitive pair of lines . as all forbidden lines , these are also sensitive to the gas density .",
    "their ratio is density - sensitive because they come from distinct upper levels . as a consequence ,",
    "the critical density for de - excitation of the @xmath8(6716  ) line is @xmath9 @xmath10 , while for the @xmath11(6731  ) , is @xmath12 @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio @xmath136716/@xmath116731 ) has a limit of @xmath14 for low - density clouds ( @xmath15 ) and a limit of @xmath16 for high - density clouds ( @xmath17 ) . in table",
    "[ lines ] we present a list of lines that belong to density - sensitive configurations with respective critical densities and limit line ratios .",
    "the two emission images of the lines , , of low critical density and , of high critical density , have intensities @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ) .",
    "these two images can be transformed in two new images   and   of low and high - density cloud emission by the transformation    @xmath20=\\frac{1}{{r}_{ld}-{r}_{hd } } \\cdot   \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & -{r}_{hd}\\\\ -1 & { r}_{ld } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right ] \\cdot \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } { i}_{ij}({\\lambda_{ld } } ) \\\\ { i}_{ij}({\\lambda_{hd } } ) \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    simple algebra shows that this holds by calculating the emission properties , using the @xmath21 and @xmath22 from table  [ lines ] .",
    "it is also simple to show that the two transformed images have the property that    @xmath23    therefore this transformation can be considered a decomposition of the image @xmath19 ) into the high and low - density cloud emission images   and .",
    "if the observed emission from a given object comes from low - density clouds only , then all the emission will be in .",
    "if we have high - density clouds only , all the emission will be in image .",
    "however , in practice , we may also have clouds with intermediate densities .",
    "for these clouds part of their emission will be computed in one image and part in the other ; the proportion will depend on how far the actual ratio ( and density ) is from the two extremes .",

    "the question that arises here is how to define the `` intermediate densities '' , as this range of densities varies from species to species ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we will define a `` low electron reference density '' , @xmath26 , as the density for which the line intensity ratio decreases the low - density ratio limit by 0.1 :    @xmath50    in the same way a `` high electron reference density '' , @xmath27 , is defined as the density for which the line intensity ratio increases the high - density ratio by 0.1 :    @xmath51    we have chosen 0.1 as the tolerance for the line ratios somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "we could have chosen , for example , 0.05 .",
    "the choice has to do with observational uncertainties , not with theoretical reasons . examining fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we see that these two choices would not produce significant differences in the reference densities .",
    "given the typical observational errors in lines that could be frequently weak , we believe that 0.1 is a more reliable quantity than 0.05 , for example .    these reference densities were also computed and are listed in table  [ lines ] .",
    "we will call the low - density regime when @xmath52 , the intermediate - density regime when @xmath53 and the high - density regime when @xmath54 .     for a sample of ions . for optical and ultraviolet wavelengths ,",
    "an electron temperature of @xmath55 k was assumed , while for x - ray wavelength , @xmath56 k. we have only plotted a few ions , for illustration . for practical reasons , ions with ratios larger than 2 were excluded .",
    "[ fig1],width=340 ]    from the data in table  [ lines ] one can see that the low reference density is distinct from the low critical density .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 for the infrared , optical and ultraviolet lines , but presents a higher range of 39  380 for the x - ray emitting lines . the high reference density is similar ( within a factor 2 ) to the high critical density except for the be - like and he - like ions . for these ions the ratio @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "these large numbers are related to the fact that the high density lines in these species are intercombination lines that have typically much higher critical density when compared to the corresponding forbidden line .",
    "the high reference density is , surprisingly , closely related to the low critical density for all infrared , optical and ultraviolet lines , as @xmath60 . for the x - ray lines this ratio varies from 8.4 to 43 .",

    "two blobs of high - density clouds , separated by 0.6 arcsec are seen near the blr , while only one is seen in the low - density cloud map .",
    "a second , but much weaker blob is seen 2.4 arcsec to the south .",
    "interestingly , the double structure that seems to emerge in the @xmath79 image resembles the double radio source observed by @xcite .",
    "the radio sources are separated by about 0.9 arcsec and have an alignment with a position angle of about @xmath80 .",
    "this can not be associated to the two blobs in hd image as they present a position angle of pa @xmath81 .        in the datacube from the nucleus of ngc 7582 ( fig .",
    "[ ngc7582 ] ) , the [ ] line emission is significantly stronger .",
    "therefore we extracted the images with a similar procedure as above , but with narrower filters ( co - adding images of contiguous wavelength pixels ) , so that velocity information is also registered .",
    "three velocity bands were defined .",
    "red is associated with a filter from 0 to @xmath82 km s@xmath83 ; green is a filter from 0 to @xmath84 km s@xmath83 and blue is from @xmath84 to @xmath85 km s@xmath83 .",
    "the blue - shifted band is necessary because of the blue wing seen in most of the forbidden lines .        the images display , first of all , a clear ( known ) galactic rotation map @xcite . in addition , in the high - density image ( fig .",
    "[ ngc7582]d ) the bulk of emission comes from two regions .",
    "these two regions are associated to the starburst character of this galaxy and their emission lines overshine that of the agn .",
    "the low - density emission image has a complex and spatially extended structure .",
    "this complexity is due to knots that correspond to h ii regions and a few hot spots , presumably supernovae remnants ",
    "snr ; in addition , a diffuse bluish emission that comes from a wind , presumably photoionized by the agn but not as much obscured , delineating the ionization cone @xcite .",
    "a paper with a full discussion of the datacube of this object is in preparation .",
    "the density sensitive emission maps should not be confused with maps of line ratios @xmath86 , which are also used in the literature . such an image",
    "does not indicate the intensity and is frequently very noisy when the denominator becomes small or even zero .",
    "the reader should be cautioned to the fact that if a given spatial pixel coincides with a low - density cloud and a high - density cloud , projected along the same line of sight , one may be confused as this could be interpreted as emission coming from an intermediate - density cloud",
    ". if velocity separation is possible , as we show in the example above , then the chance for the two clouds to coincide in spatial projection and simultaneously in velocity , diminishes .",
    "although the sum of the images of high - density and low - density is mathematically equal to the image of the line of highest critical density ( see equation  [ soma ] ) , this is not always obvious in the displayed images because of distinct lut ( look - up table ) dynamical ranges and choices .",
    "for the present methodology to be applicable , the cloud velocity distribution must be smaller than half the separation of the two lines , otherwise there will be superposition of emission on the same spectral pixel .",
    "this is usually the case for planetary nebular , regions , symbiotic stars etc . , but may not be the case for novae and supernova remnants and most of the active galactic nuclei .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the various ionic configurations have very distinct line separations .",
    "for instance , the infrared lines are quite separated ( in velocity ) as are the x - ray lines ( whose separation is @xmath87 km s@xmath83 ) where this warning does not apply .",
    "but for the nitrogen - like 2p@xmath4 configurations , the line separations are typically only 2  .",
    "this is the case for [ ] @xmath88 . in such situations",
    "the technique applies only if the involved velocities are smaller than @xmath89 km s@xmath83 .",
    "two - dimensional optical devices such as integral field units ( ifus ) and fabry - perot have advanced significantly in recent years ; the method proposed in this paper , when combined with such instruments , may provide a powerful tool for science .",
    "future developments may extend this method to other wavebands , so that many of the pairs of lined listed in table  [ lines ] could become potentially useful .    we conclude that this `` ld / hd imaging method '' may be useful in mapping low and high - density cloud distribution in astrophysical nebulae .",
    "in addition to density maps it also provides a density - related intensity image in specific forbidden lines .",
