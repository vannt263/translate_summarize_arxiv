    "understanding the interaction between light and electrons in a crystal has always been an attractive topic , and its extensive study led to the realization of many devices , such as lasers , semiconducting solar cells or led diodes .",
    "more recently it led to new discoveries , such as sub - wavelength light transmission @xcite , waveguiding @xcite , hybrid solid state / organic solar cells @xcite , etc .",
    "there are many theoretical models which successfully deal with these phenomena , mostly based on solving maxwell s equations at the boundaries of the crystals of different shapes @xcite and different dielectric properties , calculated at different levels of approximations , e.g. within the drude dielectric model @xcite , or from first principles and beyond the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "however , what is still missing is a theoretical approach where the interaction between light and crystal electrons would be calculated fully microscopically , so that the electronic structure is calculated using _ ab initio _ methods ( usually in the simplified tight - binding or subband models @xcite ) , the polarizability of the system is described by the current - current response tensor ( usually by the density - density response function @xcite ) and where the electron - electron interaction is mediated by photons ( usually described by instantaneous coulomb interaction ) .",
    "inclusion of these effects could be crucial if one wanted to explore new optically active ( radiative ) modes or self - sustainable electromagnetic modes ( polaritons ) in crystals .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a theoretical formulation of the interaction between electromagnetic field and electronic excitations in quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) crystals ( consisting of one or few atomic layers ) , suitable for investigation of optically active electronic modes and polaritons .",
    "this formulation was partially developed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was applied to investigate electromagnetic modes in the jellium metallic slab . here",
    "this formulation is extended to the case where the ground state electronic structure is calculated from first principles . to test the theory",
    "we calculate the optical absorption and conductivity in the self standing graphene monolayer and compare our results with the recent experimental and theoretical works @xcite .",
    "optical properties of graphene have already been extensively investigated , both from the experimental and theoretical viewpoints .",
    "apart from the above mentioned works , the information about optical activity of @xmath3 or @xmath4 plasmons or single particle excitations was also extracted from electron energy loss ( eels ) experiments and corresponding calculations @xcite . in some cases",
    "the dispersion relations of 2d polaritons and conductivity in doped graphene are calculated using rpa density - density response function @xcite or using additionally a phenomenological relaxation - time approximation to account for the damping effects @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite optical properties and conductivity in graphene are investigated at a high level of accuracy , beyond rpa , however the orbital and band structure are described within the tight binding approximation ( tba ) . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite optical properties of graphene are calculated from first principles including quasiparticle corrections and solving bethe - salpeter equation ( so - called gw - bse scheme ) for the polarizability tensor .",
    "this gw - bse scheme includes excitonic effects properly , resulting in a nice agreement of ultraviolet ( uv ) active @xmath5 peak with the experimental measurements , while our rpa theory underestimates this experimental value .",
    "nevertheless , our theory provides very good agreement with the experiment in the infrared ( ir ) and visible regions and is capable to calculate the optically inactive ( evanescent ) modes such as surface plasmon polaritons ( spp ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning , due to recent interest @xcite , that methodology presented in this paper can be adopted to obtain the charge - charge response function @xmath6 and the dielectric function @xmath7 of q2d material by connecting the former with current - current correlation function @xmath8 using the gauge invariance and the conservation of local charge density @xcite .",
    "numerically this can be very convenient for obtaining @xmath7 within rpa response , because the @xmath9 divergence of the bare coulomb interaction is automatically cancelled due to @xmath10 prefactor in current vertex function and the special care for @xmath11 case @xcite is not needed .    in sec .",

    "the superlattice consists of periodically repeated supercells containing several atomic layers ( crystal slab ) .",
    "we also explain how to avoid the effect of interaction with the neighboring supercells . in the second stage of the calculation",
    "we solve the dyson equation for current - current response tensor @xmath0 where irreducible current - current response tensor @xmath2 enters and electromagnetic interaction is mediated by the photonic propagator @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "here we restrict our calculations to rpa where irreducible current - current response tensor @xmath2 can be obtained directly from the crystal ks states .",
    "a problem arises from the fact that we want to investigate optical properties of single q2d crystal slab , while electronic structure is calculated for the entire 3d superlattice . this problem can not be solved simply by increasing the vertical separation between slabs because now each of them radiates electromagnetic field which spreads across the entire space and interaction between slabs is unavoidable .",
    "we solve this by cutting off the vertical range of the photon propagator @xmath1 and allowing propagation only within one q2d crystal slab .",
    "this procedure allows smaller vertical distances between adjacent slabs ( enough to avoid the overlap between their charge densities ) while still cancelling the interaction between them .",

    "<S> this paper gives a theoretical formulation of the electromagnetic response of the quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) crystals suitable for investigation of optical activity and polariton modes . </S>",
    "<S> the response to external electromagnetic field is described by current - current response tensor @xmath0 calculated by solving the dyson equation in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , where current - current interaction is mediated by the photon propagator @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the irreducible current - current response tensor @xmath2 is calculated from the _ ab initio _ kohn - sham ( ks ) orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of @xmath2 is tested in the long wavelength limit where it gives correct drude dielectric function and conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applied to the calculation of optical absorption and conductivity in pristine and doped single layer graphene and successfully compared with previous calculations and measurements . </S>"
