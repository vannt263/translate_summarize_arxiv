    "polymers carrying ionizable groups dissolved in a polar solvent dissociate into charged polymer chains and counter - ions ( ions of opposite charge ) . depending on acidic or basic property of ionizable monomers , charged polymers can be classified into polyelectrolytes containing a single sign of charged monomers and polyampholytes bearing both positive and negative charges .",
    "these macromolecules are often water - soluble and have numerous applications in industry and medicine .",
    "many biological macromolecules such as dna , rna , and proteins are charged polymers .    charged monomers of different sign",
    "can be distributed randomly along a polyampholyte chain or charges of one sign can be arranged in long blocks . with excess of one type of charges , polyampholyte solutions exhibit properties similar to those of polyelectrolyte solutions . with the same ratio of positive and negative charges on the chains , the solution behavior depends noticeably on the charge sequence .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the sequence of charged amino acids ( charge distribution ) along ionically complementary peptides affect the aggregation behavior and self - assembling process in the solution of such peptides @xcite .",
    "also , using monte carlo simulations it has been shown that charged monomers sequence of neutral block - polyampholytes affect their adsorption properties to a charged surface @xcite .",
    "the present understanding of , in particular , random polyampholytes in solution and their interaction with surfaces and polyelectrolytes has recently been reviewed @xcite .",
    "in addition , theoretical and computer simulation studies of single diblock polyampholytes @xcite , and diblock polyampholytes in solution @xcite , have been performed .",
    "the value of salt concentration in the solution is an important parameter for tuning the structural properties of polyampholyte chains . with increasing the salt concentration , the coil size and the viscosity increase in the solution of nearly charge - balanced polyampholyte chains and decrease in the case of the solution of polyampholytes with a large net charge ( the polyelectrolyte regime)@xcite .",
    "the properties of the system of polymers anchored on a surface are of great interest both in industrial and biological applications and academic research . when there is sufficiently strong repulsion between the polymers , the chains become stretched and the structure obtained is known as a polymer brush .",
    "brushes at planar and curved surfaces formed by grafted homopolymers have extensively been investigated by various theoretical methods @xcite .    in the case of polyelectrolytes grafted onto a surface ( polyelectrolyte brush ) , the repulsion of electrostatic origin between the chains can be considerable even at low grafting densities , making it easy the system to access the brush regime .",
    "the use of charged polymers instead of uncharged polymers introduces additional length scales such as bjerrum length and debye screening length to the system .",
    "polyelectrolyte brushes also have been subjected to extensive investigations involving both theoretical @xcite and computer simulation methods @xcite . at high enough grafting densities and charge fractions of polyelectrolyte chains ,",
    "most of counterions are trapped inside the polyelectrolyte brush and competition between osmotic pressure of the counterions and elasticity of the chains determines the brush thickness .",
    "this regime of a polyelectrolyte brush is known as the osmotic regime in which some theoretical scaling methods predict no dependence of the brush thickness to the grafting density @xcite .",
    "however , other scaling method that takes into account the excluded volume effects and nonlinear elasticity of polyelectrolyte chains predicts a linear dependence of the brush thickness on the grafting density and is in agreement with experiment and simulation @xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown that diffusion of a fraction of counterions outside the polyelectrolyte brush leads to a logarithmic dependence of the average brush thickness on the grafting density @xcite .",
    "brushes formed by grafted diblock polyampholytes have also been investigated by lattice mean field modeling @xcite and computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the effect of chain stiffness , charge density , and grafting density on spherical brushes of diblock polyampholytes and interaction between colloids with grafted diblock polyampholytes have been studied using monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "despite the case of an osmotic polyelectrolyte brush that counterions are trapped inside the brush and have a crucial rule in the equilibrium brush thickness , in the case of a polyampholyte brush most of counterions are outside and equilibrium brush thickness is mainly determined by the chains properties .",
    "a brush of semiflexible charged polymers is a dense assembly of such polymers in which the interplay between electrostatic correlations , entropic effects and the bending elasticity of the chains can bring about a variety of equilibrium properties .",
    "the strength of the electrostatic correlations in a polyampholyte brush depends on the sequence of charged monomers along the chains .",
    "with similarly charged monomers being arranged in long blocks , the electrostatic correlations are of great importance in the system .",
    "it seems that for a brush formed by semiflexible polyampholyte chains , each chain containing equal number of positive and negative monomers , studying the effect of monomers sequence on equilibrium properties of the brush could be an step toward better understanding of such system s.    in this paper , we study planar brushes of semiflexible polyampholytes using extensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in a wide range of the grafting density and at various salt concentrations . in our simulations ,",
    "each end - grafted polyampholyte chain contains equal number of positively and negatively charged monomers ( isoelectric condition ) .",
    "we investigate the effect of the sequence of charged monomers along the chains on equilibrium properties of the brush .",
    "charged monomers of each sign are arranged in blocks of equal length and monomers of opposite sign form regular alternation of positive and negative blocks ( see fig .",
    "[ structures ] b , c and d ) .",
    "different charge sequences in our simulations correspond to different lengths of above mentioned blocks .",
    "we also consider the case of polyelectrolyte brush in our studies in which all the charged monomers of the chains are of the same sign for comparison .",
    "we find that at each value of the grafting density , the brush formed by polyampholytes with longer blocks of similarly charged monomers has smaller average thickness , i.e. , the lowest value of the average thickness corresponds to the brush of diblock polyampholytes .",
    "the values of the grafting density that we use in our simulations correspond to the osmotic regime of the polyelectrolyte brush . in this regime ,",
    "most of the counterions are contained inside the polyelectrolyte brush and the average brush thickness has a weak linear dependence on the grafting density .",
    "dependence of the average thickness of polyelectrolyte brush that we obtain from our simulations is in agreement with nonlinear theory of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of the polyampholyte brush",
    ", we find that the average thickness considerably varies as a function of the grafting density and with longer blocks of similarly charged monomers , this dependence is stronger .",
    "counterions of a polyampholyte brush are not trapped inside the brush and dependence of the average thickness on the grafting density originates from a different mechanism than that of a polyelectrolyte brush ( see the text ) .",
    "we also study the equilibrium statistics of conformations of the chains at various grafting densities and salt concentrations both for polyampholyte and polyelectrolyte brushes .",
    "we find that in the case of polyampholyte brushes with long blocks of similarly charged monomers , at low grafting densities the inter - chain electrostatic interactions link the chains to each other in the vicinity of the grafting surface and cause the brush to collapse . at high grafting densities , although the excluded volume interactions tend to increase the brush thickness , the electrostatic interaction dominate over the bending elasticity of the chains and lead them to buckle and the brush thickness to decrease .",
    "also it is observed that with long blocks of similarly charged monomers along the chains , the average thickness of the polyampholyte brush is an increasing function of the salt concentration .",

    "it can be understood from figs .",
    "[ p_r ] and [ p_z ] that decreasing the average thickness of a polyampholyte brush with increasing the length of the blocks of similarly charged monomers originates from two different mechanisms at low and high grafting densities . at low grafting densities , the anchored chains",

    "one can conclude that in the brushes of polyampholytes with long blocks of similarly charged monomers , pa33 and pa66 , the chains have rodlike conformations and fluctuate in the vicinity of the grafting surface .",
    "snapshots of the brushes of these chains ( not shown here ) show that the chains are linked to each other as doublets near the grafting surface because of the strong electrostatic attractions . in the case of the brush of pa11 chains ,",
    "the end monomers of the chains have a uniform distribution inside the brush .",
    "in this case , electrostatic neutrality is satisfied in smaller length scales and the electrostatic correlations between the chains are very weak .    .",
    "as it can be seen , the thickness of the brush formed by the chains with long blocks of similarly charged monomers is an increasing function of the salt concentration .",
    "the size of the symbols corresponds to the size of error bars . ]     and b)@xmath60 for the brush formed by pa66 chains at different salt concentrations .",
    "the grafting density is @xmath74 . ]    at high grafting densities , the histogram of the average end - to - end distance of the chains shows that in the brushes of polyampholyte chains consisting of long blocks of similarly charged monomers , despite the case of low grafting density , the chains tend to have buckled conformations .",
    "the histogram of the average @xmath21 component of the end monomers , @xmath63 , shows two maximums around @xmath2 and @xmath75 in the case of the brush of diblock pa66 chains and three maximums in the case of the brush of pa33 chains .",
    "the energy needed for buckling a semiflexible chain @xmath76 , @xmath77 , is of the order of thermal energy , @xmath37 . in dense brushes of the chains pa33 and pa66 , blocks of similarly charged monomers of the chains form highly charged layers of monomers which produce strong electrostatic field . when the electrostatic energy of similarly charged monomers of the end blocks of the chains due to the electric field of the layer of opposite charge exceeds the bending energy , @xmath78 , the chains buckle toward the grafting surface .",
    "for example , in the case of the brush of diblock pa66 chains , the electrostatic energy of positively charged monomers of each chain roughly can be written as @xmath79 in which @xmath80 is approximately the electric field of the layer of anchored blocks of negatively charged monomers . with parameters that we use in our simulations , at high grafting densities of the brushes formed by pa33 and pa66 chains , @xmath81 and buckling of the chains is expected . in the case of the brush of pa66 chains , two maximums in the histogram @xmath63",
    "shows that buckled chains and those that are straight and perpendicular to the grafting surface coexist . in the brush of pa33 chains",
    ", there are two layers of negatively charged monomers and considering the chains of straight configuration , three maximums seen in the histogram @xmath63 is expected .",
    "the effect of added salt on the brushes of polyampholyte chains is also studied using explicit monovalent salt ions .",
    "we observe that properties of the brushes formed by the chains containing longer blocks of similarly charged monomers are more sensitive to the salt concentration .",
    "the average thickness of these brushes at all grafting densities increase with increasing the salt concentration and reach to its maximum value ( see fig .",
    "[ thickness_salt ] ) .",
    "this behavior is completely different from that of a polyelectrolyte brush which its thickness is known that decreases with increasing the salt concentration . in the case of a polyelectrolyte brush",
    "the electrostatic repulsion between the chains tend to swell the brush and the screening effect of added salt decreases the average brush thickness . however , in the case of the brush of polyampholyte chains with long blocks of similarly charged monomers , the electrostatic interactions between the chains are attractive and tend to decrease the brush thickness . in these brushes ,",
    "electrostatic screening of the salt ions increases the average thickness .",
    "it also can be seen in fig .",
    "[ thickness_salt ] that the added salt does nt change the average thickness of the brush of pa11 chains in which because of local electrostatic neutrality the electrostatic correlations are negligible . in fig .",
    "[ salt_p_r_z ] the equilibrium histograms @xmath60 and @xmath63 for the brush of pa66 chains are shown at different salt concentrations .",
    "it can be seen that with adding more salt to the system , the chains become more straight ( see part b of the figure ) and @xmath2 part of the histogram @xmath63 vanishes which means that the brush becomes more aligned .    to estimate the importance of finite size effect in our simulations",
    ", we calculated equilibrium average of @xmath66 ( defined in sec . [ sim ] ) for the brush of pa66 chains at highest grafting density @xmath82 and found that @xmath83 .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath84 is less than the lateral box length , @xmath85 , means that the chains does nt overlap with their own images in our simulations .",
    "we also repeated the simulation of the pa66 brush at grafting density @xmath82 with @xmath86 chains ( instead of @xmath44 ) and did nt obtain different results .",
    "osmotic pressure of trapped counterions inside polyelectrolyte brush in the osmotic regime is one of the main factors determining the equilibrium brush thickness . nonetheless , because of the electrostatic neutrality of the chains , gouy - chapman length diverges in the case of polyampholyte brushes considered in this paper and most of counterions are outside the brush layer ( see fig . [ snapshots ] b , c and d ) .",
    "these counterions have no rule in the equilibrium brush thickness . in this case",
    "the brush thickness is resulted from the interplay between inter- and intra - chain electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged blocks , inter - chain excluded volume interactions and the bending elasticity of the chains .",
    "hence , dependence of the average thickness of such polyampholyte brushes on the grafting density is of quite different mechanism .",
    "however , it is interesting that this dependence is still linear similar to that of a polyelectrolyte brush ( see fig .",
    "[ thickness ] ) .",
    "this dependence in brushes of polyampholyte chains with long blocks of similarly charged monomers is appreciably stronger than the case of polyelectrolyte brush ( for example in fig .",
    "[ thickness ] the slopes of dotted and dashed lines are 16.7 and 40.2 respectively ) .",
    "an important parameter in a brush of semiflexible polyampholytes is the bending rigidity of the chains , @xmath87 . with decreasing the value of @xmath87 ,",
    "electrostatic attractions dominate over the chains stiffness and in competition with excluded volume effects determine the average brush thickness .",
    "the opposite extreme is the case of the brush of rod - like polyampholytes in which electrostatic correlations can not buckle the chains .",
    "so , different regimes corresponding to different values of @xmath87 should be investigated @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study planar brushes formed by semiflexible polyelectrolytes and polyampholyte chains with different sequences of charged monomers at various grafting densities and salt concentrations .",
