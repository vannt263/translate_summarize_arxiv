    "there have recently been important changes in the paradigms of economics : economists discuss the role of the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xcite or even dare claim that quantum mechanics and mathematical economics are isomorphic @xcite .",
    "these shocking changes have probably been brought about by the emergence of econophysics .",
    "research on quantum computation and quantum information allows to extend the scope game theory for the quantum world @xcite . among various proposed qualitative scientific methods only quantum theory does not allow to take no account of the news phenomenon so persistent in social sciences @xcite .",
    "therefore the quantum - like description of market phenomena has a remarkable chance of gaining favourable reception from the experts .",
    "on the other hand only thorough investigation may reveal if economics already is in or would ever enter the domain of quantum theory .",
    "the present authors have given a general description of quantum market games ( q - games ) in a recent paper , @xcite . among them",
    "one may distinguish the class of quantum transactions ( q - transactions ) that is q - games without institutionalized clearinghouses .",
    "this class comprises quantum bargaining ( q - bargaining ) which are discussed in the present paper and quantum auction ( q - auction ) to be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "the participants of a q - bargaining game will be called alice ( @xmath0 ) and bob ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we will suppose that they settle beforehand who is the buyer ( alice ) and who is the seller ( bob ) .",
    "a two - way q - bargaining that is a q - bargaining when the last condition is not fulfilled , will be analyzed in a separate paper .",
    "alice enter into negotiations with bob to settle the price for the transaction .",
    "therefore the proper measuring apparatus consists of the pair of traders in question . in q - auction",
    "the measuring apparatus consists of a one side only , the initiator of the auction .",
    "we will identify the space of alice polarization states with the one dimensional complex projective space @xmath2 .",
    "points in @xmath2 will be called polarizations ( or q - bits @xcite ) .",
    "we will use the projective coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , we will introduce a two dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 and choose an orthonormal basis @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the scalar product of two vectors @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the complex conjugate of do @xmath11 .",
    "the proportional vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) will be identified .",
    "if we perform the transition from the homogeneous coordinates to the non - homogeneous ones , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , then the projective space @xmath2 may be identified with the compactified gauss plain @xmath17 .",
    "a point @xmath18 may in turn be identified with a point in the two dimensional sphere @xmath19 .",
    "this identification is given by the bijection @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the mapping @xmath26 is called cayley - klein parameterisation .",
    "we will use all the three equivalent descriptions @xmath27 of the space of polarization states but one must remember that the superposition ( addition ) of polarization states may only be performed in the hilbert space @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the probability of measuring the strategy @xmath28 in the state strategy @xmath29 is given by squared module of the scalar product @xmath30 of the states and may be expressed in terms of the angle @xmath31 between the corresponding unit vectors @xmath32 ( that is in @xmath19 ) by the formula @xmath33 points in the riemann sphere , @xmath18 , are in the following 1 - 1 correspondence with projective operators @xmath34 acting on the hilbert space @xmath4 : @xmath35 they are usually written as @xmath36 . in the orthonormal basis",
    "@xmath37 the projectors take the matrix form @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the unit matrix .",
    "this representation is referred to as the stokes parametrization @xcite and is the inverse one to the cayley - kleina parametrization @xmath26 .",
    "we will use the following interpretation of the alice polarization state @xmath41 ( that is of her strategy ) . if she formulates the conditions of the transaction we say she has the polarization @xmath42 ( and is in the state @xmath43 ) . in q - bargaining",
    "this means that she put forward the price . in the opposite case , when she decides if the transaction is made or not , we say she has the polarization @xmath44 .",
    "( she accepts or not the conditions of the proposed transaction . )",
    "this is an analogy of the isospin symmetry in nuclear physics which says that nucleon has two polarization states : proton and neutron .",
    "the vectors @xmath5 form an orthonormal basis in @xmath4 , the linear hull of possible alice polarization states .",
    "bob s polarization is defined in an analogous way .",
    "the states representing alice and bob strategies are fermions from the physical point of view .",
    "this seemingly surprising statement consist in noticing that the transaction in question is made only if the traders have opposite polarizations ( and even that is not a guarantee of the accomplishment ) . obviously , the states of alice and bob became entangled if they enter into q - bargaining .",
    "the reduction of the state @xmath45 ( alice ) to @xmath46 or @xmath47 always results in bob winding up in in the state @xmath48 or @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "therefore the space of polarizations of q - bargaining is isomorphic to the space of polarizations of a single participant of the bargaining in question ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the homogeneous coordinates of polarizations of q - bargaining , that is a two dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath50 , is spanned by two orthonormal vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 . a market process resulting in q - bargaining is described by a projection @xmath53 .",
    "the result of the projection depends on the choice of the basis @xmath54 ( it is sufficient to point out the vector @xmath55 ) .",
    "we will suppose that the polarization of q - bargaining is determined by the pair of participants in a unique way .",
    "+ this polarization space has a fascinating connection to lorentzian geometry ( special relativity ) .",
    "we can not help noting here that , according to penrose @xcite , @xmath56 may be identified with the heavenly sphere of light rays coming to an observer .",
    "the group of conformal transformations of the riemannn sphere @xmath57 is isomorphic to the proper lorentz group @xmath58 that preserves the minkowski metric .",
    "penrose have also shown that the points on the heavenly sphere may be obtained from spinors so that any point on the heavenly sphere corresponds to a proposition specifying the state of a spinor ( in the space of propositions in the quantum logic associated to the jordan algebra @xmath59 ) .",
    "+ the arguments given in the following paragraph show that the state @xmath60 is more profitable for alice than the state @xmath61 .",
    "the skill of replication of the vector @xmath44 would allow alice avoiding winding up in the state @xmath61 .",
    "but quantum cloning is not possible @xcite and this makes the quantum bargaining nontrivial and very interesting .",
    "it seems worth to notice that although the polarization state can not be cloned it may be transferred .",
    "we may by using classical and quantum communication channels @xcite teleport alice polarization state to another q - bargaining site . in that way alice may enter into negotiation with bill instead of bob .",
    "nevertheless , she will not be able to accomplish both transaction simultaneously .",
    "this seems to be natural if one recalls the common belief in undividity of attention .",
    "alice however may multiply her profits during a fixed interval by using financial oscillators @xcite . to this end",
    "she must be able to master validity times of various financial instruments bought or sold in q - bargaining at different times . + we will say that alice polarization @xmath62 _ dominates _ bob one @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) during q - bargaining with the polarization @xmath65 if the probability of being in the state @xmath65 is greater for alice than for bob , that is @xmath66 this definition is justified by the asymmetry of profits made on a deal by the same party having different polarizations @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ". more detailed analysis of possible profits will be presented in the following paragraph .",
    "of course , if the polarizations are the same then the relation of dominance is transitive .",
    "if we consider three parties @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath69 and every pair of them enters into a q - bargaining then we have @xmath70 in this case there is a statistical non - quantum model @xcite leading to results identical to those of the discussed here q - bargaining . however , if the polarizations are not constrained by cultural customs or initial agreement they usually are different and it is possible that @xmath71 an extreme example is the situation when @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 already known from the popular game _ rock , paper and scissors _ ( rps ) . if domination results in profit asymmetry among participants ( see below ) then traders buying or selling , say , shares issued by companies belonging to alice , bob and carol may be perceived as if playing an rps game .",
    "a quantum version of the rps game is discussed by iqbal and tool @xcite .",
    "they showed that contrary to the classical case there is a stable nash equilibrium in the quantum rps game .",
    "the observed non - transitivity of dominance in bargaining is a case in point for using quantum description of bargaining . empirical verification should decide if such approach is correct .",
    "of course , one may tray to realize q - bargaining games on quantum level where both parties may be formed by coalitions and the appropriate states would be superpositions of states of the members but this is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "let us recall that the alice strategy is , besides its polarization @xmath75 , given by the supply - demand factor @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the total state of q - bargaining , @xmath77 , belongs to the tensor product of hilbert spaces @xmath78 .",
    "let us consider the following situation .",
    "alice is going to buy some commodity at the price @xmath79 .",
    "the random variable @xmath80 describes the possible profit if the transaction would come true . to be more precise ,",
    "the additive logarithmic return ratio @xmath81 measures profits made by alice if the commodity bought at the price @xmath79 has a real value @xmath82 to her . if on the other side bob want to sell the commodity at the price @xmath79 his potential profits describes the random variable @xmath83 . note that that the supply of an asset at the price @xmath79 may be perceived as demand of money for which one pays a definite amount of the asset equal to @xmath84 .",
    "therefore there is no minus sign in the definition of the random variable @xmath85 .",
    "the axioms of quantum theory say that the probability density of revealing alice and bob intentions described by the random variables @xmath86 and @xmath85 , respectively , is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the probability amplitude of offering the price @xmath86 by alice who wants to buy and the demand component of her state is given by @xmath89 .",
    "amplitude @xmath90 is interpreted in an analogous way .",
    "of course , the `` intentions '' @xmath86 and @xmath85 not always result in the accomplishment of the transaction . if alice being in the polarization state @xmath91 offers @xmath86 that is the price @xmath92 then bob accepts it only if @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) . the symmetry @xmath95 dictates the acceptability condition for alice in the state @xmath96 .",
    "the transaction would be accomplished only if alice pays no more than she plans , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore the rationality of the decision does not depend on polarization and is described by the condition @xmath98    if we change the convention so that the variable @xmath86 describes profits of the trading with alice party instead of hers then the condition @xmath99 takes the form @xmath100 with accordingly changed interpretation of @xmath85 .",
    "+ let us use the convenient iverson notation @xcite in which @xmath101 $ ] denotes the logical value ( 1 or 0 ) of the sentence @xmath102 .",
    "the logarithm of the transaction price , @xmath103 is the random variable @xmath104 or @xmath85 depending on the polarization of the transaction ( @xmath91 or @xmath96 , respectively ) restricted by the condition @xmath99 .",

    "there is another important quantity , namely shannon entropy @xmath184 , that , instead of spin temperature , may be used to parameterize polarization states . in our case shannon entropy",

    "the temperature of alice strategy is zero because her strategy may be perceived as the limit of the normal distribution with dispersion tending to zero .",
    "this allows her to perform arbitrage .",
    "the only remedy for limiting alice profits in trading with the rest of the world consists in the lowering of the @xmath116 dispersion @xmath119 , that is the risk temperature @xmath190 . as a result",

    "this should result in formulation of nonlinear equations governing the dynamics of changes in risk and spin temperatures .",
    "but investigation of q - bargaining without the underlying thermostat @xmath116 that dictates market prices seems to be to abstract for application in economics .",
    "it is customary that the polarization state in bargaining with the rest of the world is fixed in advance ( e.g. sellers price )",

    "such a minimal model is four - dimensional and describes risk temperatures of a , b and @xmath116 and spin temperature of the q - bargaining between a and b. + note that spin temperature resembles another legendre multiplier connected to portfolio managing and introduced and discussed in ref . @xcite .",
