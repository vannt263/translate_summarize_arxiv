    "interface dynamics in a hele - shaw cell  where the motion of the viscous fluids is confined to the narrow gap between two closely spaced parallel glass plates  is a problem of considerable interest both from a theoretical standpoint as a moving free boundary problem and from a practical perspective in view of its connection to other important physical systems , such as flows in porous media , dendritic cristal growth and directional solidification @xcite .",
    "the hele - shaw system is particularly interesting when one fluid is much less viscous than the other and surface tension effects are neglected , for in this case the problem becomes quite tractable mathematically and many steady and time - dependent solutions have been found since the pioneering work by @xcite .",
    "recently , deep mathematical connections have been discovered between hele - shaw flows and other problems in mathematical physics , such as integrable systems , random matrix and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "there is also a close relation between interface dynamics in a hele - shaw cell and an important growth model known as loewner evolution @xcite .",
    "motivated by these findings , interest in hele - shaw flows ( or laplacian growth , as it is also known ) has grown well beyond its original hydrodynamics context and there is now an extensive literature on the subject and its mathematical ramifications ; for an overview , see e.g.  the recent monograph by @xcite .    yet , despite all these developments , the hele - shaw system continues to surprise and reveal more mathematical structures underlying its dynamics .",
    "recent investigations by @xcite  motivated in part by the problem of interface dynamics in a hele - shaw cell  lead to the discovery of a new class of special functions ( called the secondary schottky - klein prime functions ) associated with planar multiply connected domains .",
    "these functions are particularly useful to tackle potential - theory problems involving multiply connected domains with _ mixed boundary conditions_. one such problem  and the main theme of the present paper  is the motion of bubbles in a hele - shaw channel , in which case the velocity potential satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions on the bubble interfaces and neumann conditions on the channel walls .    in this paper ,",
    "the formalism of the secondary prime functions is used to construct exact solutions for the problem of multiple bubbles steadily translating in a hele - shaw channel , both for a finite assembly of bubbles and for a periodic stream of bubbles with an arbitrary number of bubbles per period cell .",
    "the problem of multiple fingers penetrating into the channel and moving together with an assembly of bubbles is also analysed as a particular case of the multi - bubble solutions ( when some of the bubbles becomes infinitely elongated ) . in all cases ,",
    "the solutions are given in terms of a conformal mapping @xmath0 from a multiply connected circular domain in an auxiliary complex @xmath1-plane to the flow region exterior to the bubbles in the complex @xmath2-plane .",
    "this mapping is written as the sum of two analytic functions  corresponding to the complex potentials in the laboratory and co - moving frames  that map the circular domain onto slit domains .",
    "analytical formulae for these slit maps are obtained in terms of the secondary schottky - klein ( s - k ) prime functions , which then allows us to obtain an explicit solution for the desired mapping @xmath0 .    in the case of a finite assembly of bubbles , a generalised method of images",
    "is used at first to construct the relevant complex potentials and then the resulting expressions ( containing an infinite product of terms ) are recast in terms of the secondary prime functions .",
    "this function theoretic formulation is more advantageous in that not only it has a firmer mathematical basis ( the theory of compact riemann surfaces and their associated prime functions ) but it can also handle more general cases , such as periodic solutions , that are not easily tackled by the heuristic method of images .",
    "solutions for multiple steady bubbles in a hele - shaw channel were first obtained by the author @xcite for the cases when the bubbles either are symmetrical about the channel centreline or have fore - and - aft symmetry . in such cases ,",
    "the fluid region can be reduced by virtue of symmetry to a simply connected domain , whereby the desired mappings can be constructed via the schwarz - christoffel formula .",
    "solutions for an arbitrary number of steady bubbles in an _ unbounded _ cell were obtained by @xcite in terms of the ( primary ) the schottky - klein prime function .",
    "@xcite also considered the case of a finite assembly of steady bubbles in a channel with no assumed symmetry , but it was subsequently found that the second family of prime functions used in his approach was not correctly defined ( dg crowdy 2011 , personal communication ) .",
    "exact solutions for this problem were later obtained by @xcite using an alternative method based on the generalised schwarz - christoffel mapping for multiply connected domains .",
    "their solution is expressed in the form of an indefinite integral whose integrand consists of products of ( primary ) s - k prime functions and which contains several accessories parameters that need to be determined numerically .",
    "the solutions reported here for multiple bubbles in a channel are based on an entirely different approach and have the advantage that they are given by an explicit analytical formula in terms of the secondary prime functions , with no accessory parameters whatsoever .",
    "furthermore , they can be used to generate new solutions for multiple fingers moving together with an assembly of bubbles , as will be seen later .    in the case of a periodic array of bubbles ,",
    "solutions were first obtained by @xcite for a single stream of symmetrical bubbles .",
    "this class of solutions was later extended to include the case of multiple bubbles per period cell under certain symmetry assumptions @xcite .",
    "the new family of periodic solutions reported here is much more general in that it describes an arbitrary stream of _ groups of bubbles _ , with no symmetry restriction on the geometrical arrangement of the bubbles within a period cell . here",
    "again the solutions are given in analytical form in terms of the secondary prime functions , making the computation of the bubble shapes a rather simple task , once the preimage domain in the @xmath1-plane is specified .    in light of the existence of this large class of exact solutions for multiple bubbles",
    ", it can be argued that the variety of forms observed by @xcite , in his experiments on bubbles rising in an inclined hele - shaw cell , is in part a manifestation of this multitude of solutions .",
    "further studies would of course be required for a more direct comparison between theory and experiments , but it worth noting that a good agreement was already obtained for the case of a small bubble at the nose of a larger bubble @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that not all exact solutions reported here are expected to have experimental counterparts , since they correspond to an idealised model where surface tension and three - dimensional thin - film effects are neglected .    the analysis presented here for hele - shaw bubbles might find applications in other related problems , such as hollow vortices and streamer discharges in a strong electric field .",
    "a hollow vortex is a vortex whose fluid in the interior is at rest ( and hence at constant pressure ) , and so it can be viewed as bubble with non - zero circulation . the formalism of the primary s - k prime functions has been used to find solutions for a pair of translating hollow vortices @xcite as well as for a von krmn street of hollow vortices @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible that the present method of analysis , involving multiple bubbles , may be adapted to study more general configurations of hollow vortices . in the case of steady streamers in strong electric fields @xcite , the governing equations are identical to those for hele - shaw flows , with a streamer corresponding to a bubble or finger , and so the solutions reported herein are likely to be relevant for the problem of multiple interacting streamers @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : pf ] , the problem of an assembly of a finite number of steady bubbles in a hele - shaw channel is formulated in terms of a conformal mapping @xmath0 from a circular domain in an auxiliary complex @xmath1-plane to the fluid region in the physical @xmath2-plane .",
    "the schottky groups associated with this circular domain and their corresponding schottky - klein prime functions are discussed in  [ sec : sk ] .",
    "the formalism of the secondary prime functions is then used , in ",
    "[ sec : gs ] , to obtain an analytical solution for the mapping @xmath0 .",
    "for ease of presentation , here the problem is first solved by the method of images and then the results are recast in terms of the prime functions .",
    "configurations with multiple fingers moving together with a group of bubbles are discussed in  [ sec : mf ] , as a particular case of the general solution for an assembly of bubbles . in ",
    "[ sec : ps ] , the case of a periodic array of steady bubbles in a hele - shaw channel is considered . here",
    "a fully fledged function - theoretic approach is used to construct an explicit solution for the corresponding mapping @xmath0 in terms of the secondary prime functions .",
    "we conclude the paper by briefly discussing , in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] , the main features of our results as well as other possible applications of the analysis presented herein .",
    "here we consider the problem of an assembly of a number @xmath3 of bubbles of a fluid of negligible viscosity translating uniformly with speed @xmath4 parallel to the @xmath5 axis in a horizontal hele - shaw channel filled with a viscous fluid ; see figure [ fig:1a ] for a schematic for the case @xmath6 . to avoid a proliferation of factors of @xmath7 in our expressions",
    ", it is assumed that the channel has width equal to @xmath7 .",
    "far from the bubbles , the fluid flow is supposed to be uniform with speed @xmath8 .",
    "it is also assumed that the pressure inside each bubble is constant and surface tension effects are neglected , so that the viscous fluid pressure on each bubble boundary is taken to be constant ( i.e. equal to the pressure inside the bubble ) .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the motion of a viscous fluid in a hele - shaw cell can be described by a complex potential @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the velocity potential @xmath11 is given by darcy s law : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the cell gap , @xmath14 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath15 is the pressure , and @xmath16 is the stream function conjugated to @xmath11 . as the far - field flow is uniform with unity velocity , it follows that @xmath17    now let @xmath18 denote the fluid region in the @xmath2-plane exterior to the bubbles , and denote by @xmath19 , for @xmath20 , the boundary of the @xmath21-th bubble ; see figure [ fig:1a ] .",

    "one then sees that knowledge of the solutions with @xmath183 determines all other solutions for any @xmath184 .",
    "this property was first noticed by @xcite in the context of the taylor - saffman solution for a single bubble ; it was later shown to hold for any number of bubbles @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : zu ] ) gives an explicit representation of this result .",
    "the coordinates ( @xmath185 of each bubble interface @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are given in parametric form by @xmath186 with @xmath181 as in ( [ eq : zu ] ) .",
    "note that all the geometrical information about the bubble configuration described by the solution above is encapsulated in the prescription of the preimage domain @xmath37 .",
    "this domain is characterised by its @xmath187 conformal moduli @xmath188 , which correspond physically to the area and centroids of each of the @xmath3 bubbles .",
    "thus , once the conformal moduli of @xmath37 are prescribed , a solution for a specific assembly of bubbles is obtained , examples of which are given next .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , solutions for multiple steady bubbles in a hele - shaw channel were recently found by @xcite in terms of an indefinite integral whose integrand consists of a product of primary s - k prime functions and which contains several accessory parameters that need to be determined numerically . the solution ( [ eq : zu ] ) , in contradistinction , is expressed as an explicit analytical formula in terms of the secondary prime functions @xmath141 , with no accessory parameters .",
    "given a domain @xmath37 , the corresponding bubble shapes can be readily obtained upon computation of the relevant prime functions .    in this context , it is important to point out that the numerical scheme developed by @xcite and @xcite for the computation of the primary s - k function  one that avoids the infinite product and relies on a more rapidly convergent laurent series  can be easily adapted for the evaluation of the secondary prime functions @xmath141 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the numerical computation of @xmath141 can thus be performed in an efficient manner for domains of arbitrary connectivity . using this method , we have reproduced at considerably less computational cost the specific solutions reported by @xcite .",
    "other examples of multi - bubble configurations are discussed below , where it is assumed that @xmath183 .    in the particular case that the bubbles either are symmetrical about the centreline or have fore - and - aft symmetry , solutions can be obtained by reducing the flow region to a simply connected domain and then applying the standard schwarz - christoffel formula @xcite .",
    "these symmetrical solutions can be recovered from our formula by simply prescribing a domain @xmath37 with the appropriate symmetry .",
    "more precisely , centreline symmetry is enforced by choosing the centres of all circles @xmath42 on the real axis , whereas bubbles with fore - and - aft symmetry are obtained by placing the centres of @xmath42 on the imaginary axis .",
    "two examples of assemblies of symmetrical bubbles are shown in figure [ fig:3cent ] . more generally , if @xmath37 is reflectionally symmetric about the real ( imaginary ) axis , then the resulting bubble configuration has centreline ( fore - and - aft ) symmetry  but not all bubbles will necessarily have the symmetry of the overall solution ( this happens only in the two cases just mentioned ) .",
    "for instance , in figure [ fig : f0below ] we show examples of three - bubble assemblies in which the configuration as a whole has either centreline or fore - and - aft symmetry , but where only one of bubbles ( the largest one in each case ) possesses the overall symmetry of the solution , whilst the other two bubbles are totally asymmetric .",
    "are @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 . ]    a domain @xmath37 that entails no symmetry yields , of course , a completely asymmetric bubble configuration .",
    "an example of this case is given in figure [ fig:3asym ] for a assembly of three asymmetric bubbles .",
    "solutions for a higher number @xmath3 of bubbles can be handled in similar manner .",
    "in the instance that some of the bubbles within a multi - bubble solution become infinitely elongated , whilst the other bubbles remain of finite area , one obtains a situation where multiple fingers penetrate into the channel with an assembly of bubbles moving ahead of the fingers . to be specific ,",
    "consider a situation with @xmath193 fingers and @xmath3 bubbles , where the @xmath21-th finger has a width @xmath194 and is separated from the finger to its right by a fluid gap of width @xmath195 .",
    "a schematic of the flow domain @xmath18 in the @xmath2-plane is shown in figure [ fig : fbz ] for the case @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "as before , it is convenient to work in an extended channel , @xmath54 , containing @xmath198 fingers and @xmath55 , bubbles where each additional interface is the reflection in the real axis of an interface in the original channel .",
    "the solution to this multifinger problem can be obtained from the multi - bubble solution given in  [ sec : gs ] by starting with an assembly of @xmath199 bubbles in the extended channel and then taking the limit in which @xmath198 bubbles become infinitely elongated so as to yield the desired fingers .",
    "this limit can be easily obtained in the @xmath1-plane , as follows .",
    "the @xmath193 pairs of circles @xmath42 and @xmath61 , for @xmath200 , corresponding to the @xmath198 bubbles that will become fingers should coalesce into a single circle that _ orthogonally _ intersects the unit circle @xmath38 .",
    "the other circles @xmath77 , @xmath201 , remain as they are ( and so they will map to @xmath55 bubbles of finite area ) .",
    "the resulting flow domain , denoted by @xmath202 , is shown in figure [ fig : f0tilde ] for the case @xmath197 and @xmath196 .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us establish some notation .",
    "label by @xmath203 the circle orthogonal to @xmath38 , and let @xmath204 and @xmath205 denote its center and radius , respectively",
    ". from the orthogonality condition one has @xmath206 ( without loss generality one can set @xmath207 and @xmath208 ; this choice will be implied in the remainder of this section . )",
    "the mebius map @xmath209 associated with reflection in @xmath203 , see ( [ eq : theta ] ) , is given by @xmath210 it can be verified that this map is of order two : @xmath211 .",
    "( here 1 denotes the identity map . )",
    "one may also verify that @xmath203 is invariant under @xmath212 in the following sense : @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 denote the segments of @xmath203 that are inside and outside @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "in fact , one can show that @xmath212 maps the interior of @xmath203 onto its exterior .",
    "in analogy with the group @xmath137 introduced in  [ sec : sg ] , we define the schottky group @xmath216 as the set consisting of all even combinations of the maps @xmath217 .",
    "( the generators of this group are the maps @xmath218 , which send the interior of @xmath139 onto the exterior of their images in @xmath203 . )    as discussed above , the orthogonal circle @xmath203 is to be mapped to the @xmath198 fingers , whereas the circles @xmath77 , @xmath91 , map to the @xmath55 bubbles .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the function @xmath0 must have @xmath198 logarithmic branch points on @xmath203 , corresponding to the left end points of the fingers ( i.e.  @xmath219 ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath220 the singularities that lie on @xmath214 and by @xmath221 those lying on @xmath215 , where @xmath222 note , in particular , that @xmath47 and @xmath223 are the points of intersection between @xmath38 and @xmath203 , and so @xmath224 and @xmath225 , as these are the two fixed points of the map @xmath209 .",
    "thus , the limit in which a multi - bubble solution generates a multifinger configuration is accomplished by replacing the original logarithmic singularity at @xmath143 with @xmath198 logarithmic singularities at the points @xmath226 .",
    "it then follows that in this case the solution ( for @xmath183 ) given in ( [ eq : zu2 ] ) becomes @xmath227^{\\alpha_j/2}}{\\tilde\\omega_m(\\zeta , 1)}\\right ) , \\label{eq : zfb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 is the s - k prime function defined over the group @xmath216 and the parameters @xmath229 must satisfy the condition @xmath230 to ensure single - valuedness of @xmath0 in @xmath202 .",
    "note in particular that the gap separation between two adjacent fingers is given by @xmath231 .",
    "notice furthermore that in this case ( i.e.  @xmath183 ) the combined width of the fingers is @xmath232 , as required by fluid mass conservation .",
    "once the parameters @xmath233 and the conformal moduli @xmath234 of the domain @xmath235 are prescribed , a specific solution for @xmath193 fingers moving together with an assembly of @xmath3 bubbles in a hele - shaw channel is obtained .",
    "the shapes of the different interfaces correspond to the images under the mapping ( [ eq : zfb ] ) of the circles @xmath42 , @xmath236 .",
    "for example , the coordinates of the @xmath21-th finger are given by @xmath237 where @xmath238 .",
    "similar expression as in ( [ eq : xy ] ) is obtained for the bubble coordinates .",
    "a related solution for one symmetrical finger with an assembly of symmetrical bubbles in front of it was obtained before @xcite using schwarz - christoffel methods .",
    "the present solutions are much more general in that they describe any number of fingers and bubbles , with no symmetry assumption , and have furthermore the advantage of being given by an explicit mapping function from which the shapes of the interfaces can be easily computed .",
    "an example with one asymmetric finger and one asymmetric bubble ( @xmath239 ) is shown in figure [ fig:1fb ] , whereas figure [ fig : f0fb ] shows a configuration with two fingers and one bubble ( @xmath196 , @xmath6 ) .     and the parameters are @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 . ]     and @xmath197 ) corresponding to the parameters @xmath243 , @xmath241 , and @xmath244 . ]    before leaving this section , it is perhaps worth mentioning that in the case when no bubble is present ( @xmath245 ) , the s - k prime function becomes a monomial , i.e.  @xmath246 , yielding a solution ( for @xmath193 fingers only ) of the form @xmath247^{\\alpha_j/2}}{\\zeta- 1}\\right ) .",

    "this recovers ( in different representation ) the asymmetryic finger obtained by @xcite as a generalisation of their solution @xcite for a symmetrical finger ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "in this section we consider the case of a periodic array of bubbles steadily moving in a hele - shaw channel .",
    "the problem is formulated in a general setup where it is supposed that there is an arbitrary number of bubbles per period cell and no assumption is made as to the geometrical arrangement of the bubbles within a period cell ; see figure [ fig : zp1 ] for a schematic .",
    "this contrasts with all previous periodic solutions @xcite where symmetry requirements are imposed _ a priori_. as in the case of a finite assembly of bubbles discussed in ",
    "[ sec : gs ] , exact solutions for the present problem are obtained in the terms of a conformal mapping from a circular domain to the flow region exterior to the bubbles ( within a period cell ) . here , however , a fully fledged function theoretic approach is used , whereby the desired mapping functions are obtained by directly exploiting the properties of the secondary prime functions .",

    "the motion of an assembly of bubbles in a hele - shaw channel is a free boundary problem which is made more difficult by the fact that the relevant field ( the velocity potential ) is defined over a multiple connected domain and on whose boundaries it satisfies mixed boundary conditions .",

    "were obtained for the conformal mapping from a circular domain to the corresponding flows region in the physical plane .",
    "several examples of specific solutions for these distinct arrangements were given .",
    "it is important to emphasise that , taken together , the results reported here represent the complete set of solutions for multiple steady bubbles and fingers in a horizontal hele - shaw channel when surface tension is neglected .",
    "a variant of the hele - shaw problem that has received less attention is the case when the cell is rotated about the centerline away from the horizontal . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only known solution for this situation was obtained by @xcite for the case of a non - symmetric finger .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether this solution can be extended for the case of multiple bubbles in a rotated cell .",
    "the additional complication here is that the flow region in the complex potential plane consists of a strip with _ slanted _ slits ( rather than vertical ones ) , and conformal mappings to this type of slit domains are not yet known .",
    "another possible extension of the present research would be to consider time evolving bubbles in a hele - shaw cell .",
    "recently , a general class of time - dependent solutions for a single bubble in a hele - shaw channel was obtained by @xcite in the terms of a conformal mapping from an annulus to the fluid region outside the bubble .",
