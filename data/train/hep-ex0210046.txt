    "moments of hadronic mass spectrum and of lepton energy spectrum are sensitive to the masses of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks as well as to the non - perturbative parameters of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "they allow to improve the determination of the @xmath3 element of the ckm quark coupling matrix which can be measured from inclusive semileptonic b decays by using the relation :    @xmath4    the current experimental accuracy on the semileptonic branching ratio and b lifetime is about 1% , while the evaluation of the function @xmath5 , based on operation product expansion , brings an uncertainty of the order of several percent , making it the dominant error contribution .",
    "moreover , the comparison of these results with different measurements of the same parameters provides a test of the consistency of the theoretical predictions for inclusive semileptonic b  decays and of the underlying assumptions .",
    "previous measurements of spectral moments have been performed at the @xmath6 @xcite , delphi has performed the first measurement in @xmath1 hadron semileptonic decays at the @xmath7 .",
    "there are several advantages in the @xmath7 kinematics , mainly the large boost acquired by the b quark ( @xmath8 gev ) which gives access in the laboratory frame to the low region of the lepton energy spectrum .",
    "the challenge in this case is the complete reconstruction of the b system .",
    "the lepton energy acceptance extending down to the lower end of the spectrum makes these results both easier to interpret and complementary to those obtained at the @xmath6 .    in this study",
    "two different formulations , using different mass definitions for deriving the constraints on the ope parameters , are used .",
    "the hadronic mass distribution of @xmath9 events have been studied  @xcite .",
    "d@xmath10 events have been reconstructed in the three channels : d@xmath11 , d@xmath12 , d@xmath13 with the d@xmath14 , d@xmath15 and d@xmath16 mesons fully reconstructed .",
    "leptons have been required to have a momentum greater than 2  gev/@xmath2 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the separation of the signal from the background has been achieved by means of a discriminant variable based on the topological properties of the secondary vertex such as the presence of additional charged particles in addition to the d , the lepton and the neutrino .",
    "d@xmath17 candidates have been separated in `` right sign '' and `` wrong sign '' , considering the charge correlation between the d and the pion , and the discriminant variable distributions have been fitted to the simulation expectation in the two samples separately . only d@xmath18 events , with one missing pion , can contribute to `` wrong sign '' candidates and no evidence of signal have been found in this sample .",
    "the following upper limits have been derived at 90% c.l .",

    "[ fig : deltam ]    therefore only d@xmath17 states have been considered in the following analysis of the hadronic mass distribution of the d@xmath10 states .",
    "a fit to the variable @xmath22 has been performed , considering the contributions of narrow and broad resonant states d@xmath23 , d@xmath24 , d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 as well as non resonant d@xmath17 states .",
    "an example of @xmath27 distribution is shown in figure  1 . the total rate for d@xmath10 production amounts to :    @xmath28 and the broad d@xmath24 is the dominant contributing channel",
    ".    moments of the d@xmath10 mass distribution have been evaluated from the fitted mass distributions . to determine the moments of the complete hadronic mass distribution , in @xmath1-hadron semileptonic decays , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 components",
    "have been included using the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the relative branching fractions derived from published results and @xmath34 is obtained by imposing the constraint @xmath35 and using the above measurement .",
    "the following preliminary delphi results have been obtained :    @xmath36 + @xmath37 + @xmath38 + @xmath39 +    where the first uncertainty is statistic and the second is systematic .",
    "the moments of the lepton energy spectrum provide constraints similar to those of the hadronic mass .",
    "further they offer an important consistency test of the theory .",
    "an inclusive reconstruction of the semileptonic decays has been performed  @xcite . muons and electrons with a momentum greater than 2.5 and 3.0 gev / c , respectively , have been tagged in a sample of @xmath40 events .",
    "secondary vertices have been reconstructed using an iterative procedure .",
    "the b energy has been reconstructed adding to the charm vertex energy , the lepton energy and the neutrino energy , evaluated from the event missing energy .",
    "[ fig : lep_spectrum ]    the b direction has been estimated from both the reconstructed b momentum and the b decay flight direction .",
    "boosting the leptons in the b reconstructed rest frame provides a typical energy resolution of 250 mev . in order",
    "to separate signal @xmath41 events form @xmath42 and other backgrounds without introducing significant biases to the lepton energy distribution , two probabilistic variables have been defined based on charge correlation and event topology . the measured energy spectrum after background subtraction",
    "is shown in figure  2 .",
    "for this preliminary result only 1994 and 1995 statistics have been used , corresponding to a sample of 18,300 leptons . after unfolding the resolution smearing , the first , second and third moments have been calculated .",
    "the relevant corrections for distortions due to electromagnetic radiation , contamination of @xmath43 decays and contribution of b@xmath44 and @xmath45 hadrons in the events sample have been applied .",
    "the following preliminary delphi results have been obtained :    @xmath46 + @xmath47 + @xmath48 +    where the first uncertainty is statistic and the second is systematic .",
    "two different approaches have been followed in order to obtain constraints on the non - perturbative parameters of ope from the measured spectral moments .",
    "the first  @xcite is based on an expansion on the pole masses @xmath49 and @xmath50 and expresses the @xmath1-energy parameter as @xmath51 , while the second  @xcite uses running heavy quark masses @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the kinetic energy expectation value @xmath54 , corresponding to @xmath51 .    results obtained from the measured values of the first two moments of the hadronic mass spectrum and lepton energy spectrum have been found to be compatible .",
    "an exemplification is given in figure  3 showing constraints extracted in the @xmath55 - @xmath51 plane which give :    @xmath56 + @xmath57    where the quoted uncertainties are statistic , systematic and related to the power corrections and @xmath58 uncertainties , respectively .",
