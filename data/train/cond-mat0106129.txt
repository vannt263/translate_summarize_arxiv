    "another important viewpoint is the collective nature of @xmath19 carriers including the orbital degree of freedom , which is thought to have a great impact on extraordinary properties of the manganites , i.e. , colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) .",
    "@xcite the conspicuous examples are recent findings of the `` orbiton '' , a new elementary excitation of the orbital - ordered state observed in lamno@xmath2 @xcite and of the `` charge stripes '' , a new periodic form composed of a pairing of diagonal mn@xmath5 with mn@xmath6 observed in la@xmath16ca@xmath17mno@xmath2 @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the understandings of the role of @xmath19 carriers with variation of @xmath4thus the collective phenomena of @xmath19 carriers in connection with the specific kind of the charge ordering depending on @xmath4have attracted interests and may be of central topics in co manganites .",
    "more recently , asaka _ et al_. proposed the model of the ce - type structure in pr@xmath21ca@xmath22mno@xmath2 by using the transmission electron spectroscopy as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "@xcite it may be viewed as a quasi - one dimensional electronic structure with the reduced dimensionality as compared to the well - known ce - type structure [ fig .",

    "@xmath26 orbital of mn@xmath5 was cliped by three mn@xmath6 ions .",
    "such a regular pattern of the distinct charges modifies the uniformity of the charge density , leading to the development of the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) condensate .",
    "@xcite this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ; the charge density ( shared area ) periodically varies with the position and also time ( dashed line ) , so the new modulation occurs in the underlying lattice ( the period of this modulation is larger than the lattice constant ) .",
    "such a cdw formation is recently deduced from the one - dimensional fermi - surface ( fs ) topology in a layered manganite la@xmath27sr@xmath28mn@xmath29o@xmath30 by chuang _ et al_. ; @xcite they determined the detailed map of the fs by using the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy and concluded that fs is subject to cdw instabilities even in the ferromagnetic metallic state . in the sight of these considerations ,",
    "the charge ordering is also characterized by a collective excitation well below @xmath8 .",
    "however , no clear evidence for the collective excitation of the co state was reported so far ( see , _ note added _ ) .",
    "the collective excitation is associated with the mode depending on both the position and the time ; the modes arising from the former and the later are referred to as amplitudons and phasons , respectively .",
    "@xcite according to lee _",
    "et al_. , @xcite the dispersion relation of the phasons is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the wavenumber . by the illumination of light ,",
    "the collective excitation can make a coupled oscillation , which yields the change of the dielectric constant at @xmath33 , being in proportional to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the longitudinal and transverse optical frequencies , respectively .",
    "therefore , this kind of the coupled mode comes to the surface as a collective excitation mode in the complex optical spectrum .",
    "it is also important that the impurity and/or the lattice imperfection has striking influence on the cdw dynamics , because the cdw condensate is pinned by the impurity and therefore the peak position of the collective excitation mode shifts to a finite frequency .",
    "@xcite    in this article we provide the spectroscopic evidence for the cdw condensate in the typical co manganite pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "the basis of this conclusion is derived from the first observation of the collective excitation mode in the optical conductivity spectrum .",
    "as well - known cdw system like a quasi - one dimensional k@xmath1moo@xmath2 , the collective excitation mode frequently appears in the millimeter @xmath9 range @xmath37 mev , @xcite where it is difficult to get the probing light by the conventional optical spectroscopy .",
    "we overcome this limitation by using thz time - domain spectroscopy ( tds ) , @xcite which is a powerful tool to unveil the low - energy charge dynamics of the cmr manganites .",
    "@xcite in addition to this advantage , thz - tds is especially suited to capture the signal of the fluctuation phenomenon as the high @xmath9 thz pulse is sensitive and matches on the typical time scale of the charge fluctuation in correlated electron system , which is instantiated by thz - tds experiments on underdoped bi@xmath29sr@xmath29cacu@xmath29o@xmath38 .",

    "the remarkable characteristics compared to other co manganites are such an admissibility of the charge ordering and the cmr effect , in which the dramatic variance of the resistance by more than 10 orders of magnitude was attained @xcite therefore , various kind of the experimental results are accumulated to date .",
    "@xcite it should be mentioned that there are variant interpretaions about the low - temperature phase below 110 k : one is due to the coexistence of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases proposed by jirk _ et al_. ; @xcite another is the canted antiferromagnetic phase ( or the spin - glass phase ) reported by yoshizawa _",

    "@xcite ( ii ) the spectral weight of the collective excitation mode is typically 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the single - particle excitation .",
    "@xcite this is due to the relatively large @xmath63 mev , which is in strong contrast to the small spin gap @xmath64 mev observed in the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) system . in the sdw system , the spectral weight of the collective excitation mode should be comparable to that of the single - particle excitation due to the electron - electron interaction.@xcite ( iii ) kim _ et al_. found that the pinning frequency in ( ta@xmath65nb@xmath66se@xmath67)@xmath29i alloys linearly shifts to higher @xmath9 and @xmath59 at the pinning frequency does not change with increasing the impurity concentration @xmath68 .",

    "the description of the cdw condensate in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 is consistent and may explain following previous studies .",
    "the cdw easily couples with the lattice and affects phonon modes .",
    "therefore , new infrared modes are expected to be active below @xmath7 .",

    "et al_. have measured current - voltage characteristics of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and found the beginning of the nonlinear conduction above the threshold electric field , @xcite which reminds us of the sudden motion of the cdw ( cdw depinning ) as observed in cdw materials .",
    "@xcite    we should note the previous work about the impurity effect on @xmath59 in a copper oxide superconductor .",
    "et al_. reported that the zn ( impurity)-doping of the cu - site in yba@xmath29cu@xmath67o@xmath38 distracts the superconductivity and induced the finite peak structure around 10 mev ( ref . ) .",
    "they concluded that this structure arises from the localization of the charge carriers produced by the randam distribution of the zn on the cu - site ( disorder ) on the basis that the integrated area of @xmath59 up to 1 ev conserves as far as 3.5% zn - doping .",
    "however , same authors also pointed out that if the drude - like response in yba@xmath29cu@xmath67o@xmath38 appears as a result of the collective excitation which is prospective by theory , the peak structure in yba@xmath29(cu@xmath65zn@xmath66)@xmath67o@xmath38 can be regard as the collective excitation mode as in both cases of the cdw and sdw . @xcite    it is well known that the collective excitation mode originates in two different states ; one is a  pinned \" state due to the pinning of the cdw condensate by the impurity and/or the lattice imperfection and another is the  bound \" state , which is created by the coupling of the pinned state with the optical phonon or the impurity near the pinned state .",
    "@xcite despite the fact that the swelling of @xmath59 below the low - energy side of the finite structure , which is usually ascribed to a internal deformation of the pinned collective excitation mode , @xcite can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we can not clearly claim whether the observed mode is assigned to the pinned or the bound collective excitation mode of the cdw .",
    "one pregnant result is that @xmath70 below the peak structure crosses zero around 8 mev and reaches the minus value with decreasing @xmath9 [ fig . [ fig4](a ) ] .",
    "this implies the presence of another @xmath71 and of the another peak structure below the measured @xmath9 range .",
    "further experiments on @xmath72 in the ghz @xmath9 range are necessary to perform the detailed discussion and are now in progress using the cavity perturbation technique .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) , the collective excitation mode can be seen even above @xmath7 , while its spectral shape is blurred due to the large proportion of the background contribution above @xmath7 .",

    "[ fig7 ] [ the fitting procedure by eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) was performed using the data below @xmath73 ] .",
    "this excludes the thermal fluctuation as the origin of this broadening , leading us to conclude that the dynamical short - range co ( charge fluctuation ) is still subsistent above @xmath7 instead of the long - range co below @xmath7 .",
    "such a short - range co has been already reported by other experiments : radaeli _ et al_. and shimomura _ et al_. have revealed that the short - range co of pr@xmath16ca@xmath17mno@xmath2 with @xmath75 , @xcite 0.35 , 0.4 , and 0.5 , @xcite exists even above @xmath7 by neutron and x - ray scattering experiments , respectively . as in the case of the cdw system such as k@xmath1mo@xmath65w@xmath66o@xmath2 and ( tase@xmath67)@xmath29i , the collective excitation modes",
    "are also observed above the cdw transition temperature @xmath76 due to the presence of the fluctuating cdw segments , which are systematically investigated by schwartz _",
    "et al_. @xcite for example , the collective excitation mode of k@xmath1moo@xmath2 is visible even at 300 k ( @xmath77 k ) .    finally , we comment on thz radiation from pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 thin films excited by the femtosecond optical pulses , which we found recently ; @xcite the radiated spectrum decreases rapidly in intensity with increasing @xmath9 and seems to show the depletion around 2.4 mev . as",
    "compared to figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , such a thz response is due to the absorption of the collective excitation mode during the propagation of the generated thz pulse inside the material .",
    "summarizing , by using thz - tds , for the first time , we reported the presence of the finite peak structure around 23 mev in pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and assigned it to the collective excitation mode arising from the cdw condensate",
    ". the measurements on the polarization dependence of @xmath59 with the grazing incidence of light using the single - domain single crystal will provide the direct evidence and more detailed information for the collective excitation mode .",
    "in especially , the measurements of @xmath59 in the ghz @xmath9 range are needed to perform further quantitative discussions .",
    "further interests are to study the melting process under external perturbations and @xmath4 dependence of the collective excitation mode ; for example , @xmath8 decreases linearly with @xmath4 from 0.3 to 0.5 , @xcite whereas @xmath7 gradually increases and behaves the less-@xmath4 dependent .",
