    "soft  repeaters ( sgr ) are distinguished from the classical  bursters by their recurrence and  spectra ( higdon & lingenfelter @xcite ; norris et al .",
    "@xcite ) . of the three sgrs",
    "known , one , sgr@xmath21806@xmath020 , is associated with the center - filled , non - thermal radio nebula g10.0@xmath00.3 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which has an  source , ax@xmath21805.7@xmath02025 , coincident with its peak ( murakami et al .  @xcite ; cooke @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity to what is observed for plerions ( pulsar - powered supernova remnants ) like the crab nebula , has led to the hypothesis that sgrs are young pulsars .",
    "however , it is unknown why only some pulsars become sgrs , and how a pulsar can produce the brilliant bursts of @xmath3  rays that are observed .",
    "models involving a companion could address both issues .",
    "in fact , a highly reddened , luminous star ( star  a ) has been suggested to be the stellar counterpart of sgr@xmath21806@xmath020 ( kulkarni et al.@xcite , hereafter k95 ; vasisht , frail , & kulkarni @xcite ) . in this paper , we present spectroscopic observations of this star .",
    "a k - band spectrum of star  a was kindly taken for us in august , 1994 , by our colleagues l.j .",
    "smith and p.a .",
    "crowther , using the cooled grating spectrograph  4 attached to the united kingdown infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the spectrum covers 2.022.22@xmath4 with a spectral resolution @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",
    "atmospheric and instrumental effects were removed by division by a spectrum of hr@xmath27377 ( with its  br@xmath3 line artificially removed ) .",
    "flux calibration was done by scaling the spectrum to produce the k - band magnitude from k95 .",
    "the reduced spectrum , reproduced in figure  1 , shows a number of emission features arising from both low and high - excitation ions ( table  1 ) .",
    "the emission lines are reflected as wiggles in low - resolution ( @xmath7 ) grism spectra taken earlier with the hale 200-inch telescope on palomar mountain .",
    "these h and k - band spectra were used by k95 to argue that star  a was not a late - type luminous star .",
    "new j and h - band spectra were obtained in october , 1994 , with the same instrumental setup that was used by k95 , except that a new 256@xmath8256 insb array was used , and that the slit was narrowed to 05 to double the spectral resolution .",
    "all spectra were corrected for telluric and instrumental features using spectra of hr@xmath27643 , and flux - calibrated by scaling to the observed magnitudes from k95 .",
    "the spectra , reproduced in figure  2 , show a number of additional emission features ( table  1 ) .",

    "the spectra of star  a are similar to those observed for luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , such as @xmath38  car , and b[e ] stars ( allen , jones , & hyland @xcite ; mcgregor et al .",
    "@xcite , b ; hamann et al.@xcite ) .",
    "similar emission lines are also observed in some young stellar objects ( ysos ) , but for the two k - band spectra that we could find , of the becklin - neugebauer ( b - n ) object ( scoville , kleinmann , & hall @xcite ) and of lkh@xmath39101 ( simon & cassar @xcite ) , the line strengths and ratios are very different from what we observe .",
    "in addition , for the b - n object , lines of h@xmath40 are observed , which are not present in our spectra .",
    "one can infer from the presence of strong emission lines that there is a substantial amount of circumstellar matter in the system .",
    "this could be either in the form of a disk or an outflowing wind . in figure  1 , br@xmath33 appears to have a blueshifted absorption component , i.e. , a p  cygni profile .",
    "if so , it would indicate an outflow velocity of @xmath41km@xmath2s@xmath42 .",
    "the width of the emission lines is consistent with such an outflow velocity .",
    "it is similar to the velocity outflow seen in @xmath38  car ( hamann et al.@xcite ) , but much larger than the outflow velocity seen in the b - n object and lkh@xmath39101 ( scoville et al .",
    "@xcite ; simon & cassar @xcite ) .",
    "since sodium is not expected to be neutral at the temperatures necessary to excite helium , the simultaneous presence of both a na@xmath2i and a he@xmath2i line in the spectrum may be surprising .",
    "it probably indicates that there are two physically distinct circumstellar regions , e.g. , a disk and a radiation - driven wind ( allen et al .",
    "@xcite ; mcgregor et al .",
    "@xcite ; scoville et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath43 in absorption indicates that the star proper is hot . from the equivalent width",
    ", one can infer a spectral type b2o9 ( hanson & conti @xcite ) .",
    "for such a star , the intrinsic ir colors are essentially neutral ( @xmath44mag . ) . however , for some lbvs ( mcgregor et al .",
    "@xcite , b ) and for all b[e ] stars ( zickgraf @xcite ) , the intrinsic colors are much redder ( @xmath45mag . ; @xmath46mag . ) , indicating the presence of hot dust ( @xmath47k ) .",
    "we can test for the presence of dust by dereddening the observed colors for star  a ( @xmath48mag . ;",
    "@xmath49mag . ;",
    "although the interstellar extinction law is rather uncertain , with values for @xmath50 ranging from 1.6 to 2.1 ( mathis @xcite ) , we find that the presence of dust is excluded .",
    "thus , the object is most likely not a b[e ] star .    assuming neutral colors and using an extinction curve appropriate for the galactic centre ( from rieke & lobofsky @xcite ; for this curve , @xmath51 ) , we infer a foreground extinction @xmath52 of @xmath53mag .",
    "an almost identical value is deduced from model fitting of the  data of ax@xmath21805.7@xmath02025 ( sonobe et al.@xcite ) .",
    "k95 suggested that this extinction arises in a molecular cloud in the direction of sgr@xmath21806@xmath020 , located at a distance of about 6@xmath2kpc .",
    "if so , then given the minimum distance of 6@xmath2kpc , the absolute j magnitude of star  a would be @xmath54mag .",
    "since the spectral type is b2 or earlier , the bolometric magnitude would be @xmath55mag .  and the bolometric luminosity @xmath56 .",
    "only the most massive stars , including lbvs such as @xmath38  car , have such high luminosities ( humphreys & davidson @xcite ) .",
    "from the emission - line spectrum and the inferred luminosity it follows that star  a is most likely a star similar to a lbv .",
    "it can only be classified as a ` candidate lbv ' , however , since there is as yet no evidence for the large variability that is one of the defining characteristics of lbvs ( humphreys & davidson @xcite ) .    extrapolating from the lmc ( humphreys & davidson @xcite )",
    ", we estimate that there are only a couple of hundred stars of similar luminosity in our galaxy . the probability of a chance coincidence with the radio peak ( 1 ; vasisht et al .",
    "@xcite ) or even the quiescent  source ( 11 ; cooke @xcite ) is exceedingly small . we conclude that star  a is a very luminous stellar counterpart of sgr@xmath21806@xmath020 .",
    "the impact of this new finding on our understanding of the nature of sgrs is unclear .",
    "if the sgr outbursts originate on or near young , rapidly rotating neutron stars , as seems likely given the short timescales and high luminosities ( higdon & lingenfelter @xcite ; norris et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the neutron star can not be an isolated object .",
    "if interaction with the companion causes the outbursts , this could explain why only some young neutron stars show bursts , while others , like the crab , do not .",
    "however , in the error box of the  counterpart of sgr  0526@xmath066 , associated with the supernova remnant ( snr ) n49 in the lmc , there is no star similar to a lbv or b[e ] star ( rothschild , kulkarni & lingenfelter @xcite ; fishman , duthie , & dufour @xcite ) . from a ccd image , taken with the 2.3-m telescope at siding spring observatory in a band centered on 6620@xmath2  ( relatively free of snr emission lines ) , we infer a limit on the absolute magnitude @xmath57mag . hence , any binary model for sgrs must not rely on the presence of a massive stellar companion .    for sgr  1806@xmath020 , the quiescent radio ( vasisht et al .",
    "@xcite ) and  ( sonobe et al .",
    "@xcite ) emission do not show the large variations typically observed in accreting systems .",
    "this suggests that little interaction takes place in quiescence , perhaps because the pulsar wind and magnetic field prevent matter from accreting .",
    "it could be that the quiescent emission is due to the pulsar spinning down , and that the companion merely acts as a trigger or a catalyst for the  bursts .",
    "models attributing sgr flashes to accretion of planetesimals or asteroids ( see higdon & lingenfelter @xcite ; katz , toole , & unruh @xcite and references therein ) may not be as far fetched as had been thought before .",
    "we thank l.  j.  smith and p.  a.  crowther for obtaining the ukirt spectrum for us , t.  r.  geballe for useful discussions about the line identifications , and j.  f.  bell and m.  a.  dopita for obtaining the ccd image of n49 .",
