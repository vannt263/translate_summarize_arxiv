    "the energy curve which corresponds asymptotically to the @xmath1 state is attractive while those corresponding to the three @xmath2 states are repulsive .",
    "therefore , in the adiabatic approximation the @xmath15 cross sections are expected to depend on the short range part of the potential while this is not the case for @xmath108 scattering . at energies above 2 ev",

    "the quantum mechanical results obtained for the exact potential and the dipole approximation with the short range cutoff agree well for angular momentum @xmath111 while the lowest partial waves are sensitive to the short range behaviour of the approximating potentials .",

    "for @xmath80 the @xmath17 can get very close to the proton and the use of a small number of atomic orbitals is not sufficient  a better description in this region is needed in a true three  body framework .",
    "it is seen that a substantial part of the @xmath15 cross section comes from partial waves with low @xmath60 , so this result also explains why the uncertainty of the elastic @xmath1 cross section is larger than for the other reactions .",

    "equation  ( [ formula ] ) is based on the approximation of continuous energy loss . to provide a more realistic treatment of the evolution in kinetic energy",
    "we use a monte carlo program based on the differential cross sections for the four processes @xmath15 , @xmath12 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "in addition to the collisional processes , the @xmath10 radiative transition is also included in the code . the fate of a @xmath17 formed in the @xmath1 state with kinetic energy @xmath19 is thus either to undergo @xmath10 radiative transition after the stark mixing @xmath12 or to end up in the @xmath1 state with kinetic energy below the threshold with probability @xmath114 .",

    "figure  [ figf ] shows the surviving fraction @xmath114 calculated with the monte carlo program for target density @xmath128 .",
    "the approximation  ( [ formula ] ) gives somewhat higher values for the survival probability than the exact kinetics calculation at @xmath129ev .",
    "the monte carlo results at high energies ( @xmath130ev ) are significantly larger than those obtained from eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) where continuous energy loss is assumed .",
    "the reason is that the backward scattering ( see fig .",
    "4 ) with maximum possible energy loss plays an important role in bringing the @xmath8 atoms below the @xmath2 threshold for higher energies .    in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainty of @xmath114 we performed the monte carlo calculation with the cross sections obtained in the dipole approximation . in all cases the monte carlo calculations are consistent with the results corresponding to the exact potential : at 2 ev the surviving fraction is in the range @xmath131 for atomic target mass and @xmath132 for molecular target mass .",
    "the use of the target mass @xmath133 instead of @xmath134 leads to somewhat higher survival fractions because of a simple kinematical reason : the loss of kinetic energy in a collision with the same angle in the cms is larger for the target of smaller mass and , furthermore , the inelastic threshold is higher for the scattering from the atomic target . merely substituting the atomic mass with the molecular mass for the hydrogen target",
    "does not account for the additional energy loss due to rotational and vibrational excitations of h@xmath135 .",
    "one would therefore expect that the slowing down process is more efficient than this model suggests and the survival probability calculated with molecular target mass is underestimated .",
    "the opposite is true for calculations with atomic target : here the transfer of kinetic energy from the @xmath17 to the individual hydrogen atoms is not restricted by molecular bindings .",
    "thus results with atomic target probably give somewhat optimistic results for the surviving fraction .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "the detailed monte carlo kinetics calculations predict the surviving metastable fraction of the @xmath1 state of @xmath17 to be larger than @xmath136 for the initial kinetic energy 1  ev in agreement with earlier estimates   @xcite . for higher initial kinetic energies ,",
    "our result is significantly larger than the earlier estimates : the surviving metastable fraction for @xmath137  ev is about @xmath138 .",
    "this effect is due to a sizeable contribution of backward scattering in elastic collisions .",
    "our monte carlo calculations are based on the cross sections calculated in the coupled - channel approximation .",
    "the main limitation of this method for the problem concerned comes from the use of a small number of atomic states to describe the @xmath17 system and the neglect of the molecular structure of the target .",
    "a more accurate treatment of the @xmath139 three body problem is needed in order to do reliable calculations for a few lowest partial wave amplitudes .",
    "our approach , however , is well suited for the description of the collisions with the characteristic scale of impact parameters of the order of @xmath140 which is exactly the case for the problem involved",
    ". therefore our results provide a significantly improved basis for a better estimate of the metastable @xmath8 fraction @xcite which is very important for the planned lamb  shift experiment at psi @xcite .",
