    "the _ ab initio _ calculation of the light hadron spectrum is a major goal of lattice qcd .",
    "a calculation of the light - hadron spectrum giving results in good agreement with experiment would be a demonstration that qcd describes long - distance strong - interaction physics .",
    "furthermore , the calculation is an essential precursor to the calculation of other non - perturbative observables in qcd , such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , leptonic and semi - leptonic decay matrix elements and the moments of the nucleon structure function .",
    "lattice calculations are however subject to systematic errors from the non  zero lattice spacing , the finite volume of the lattice , the extrapolation in the valence quark mass to the chiral limit , and the quenched approximation . in this paper",
    ", the effects of the first two sources of error will be examined .",
    "symanzik @xcite proposed an improvement programme for reducing the dependence of observables on the lattice spacing , @xmath15 , by adding to the action higher - dimension operators with appropriately calculated coefficients .",
    "this should enable a more reliable extrapolation to the continuum limit , using data at larger values of the lattice spacing .",
    "given that the computational effort scales as @xmath16 in the quenched approximation , the potential savings are considerable .",
    "the standard gluon action has discretisation errors of @xmath17 .",
    "the wilson fermion action , on the other hand , has discretisation errors of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the first step in the symanzik improvement programme is to reduce the leading - order error of the fermion action to the same order as that of the gluon action .",
    "the resulting sheikholeslami - wohlert ( sw ) action  @xcite introduces an extra operator , @xmath18 , the so - called clover term , to the original action , multiplied by a parameter @xmath5 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the standard wilson action defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 is a lattice definition of the field strength tensor , detailed in @xcite .",
    "there is a value of the parameter @xmath5 , @xmath24 , which removes all @xmath1 errors from spectral quantities  @xcite . in this paper , we compare the spectrum obtained using the wilson fermion action ( @xmath4 ) with that obtained using the sw fermion action with two choices of @xmath5 : the classical value , @xmath2 , and a mean - field or tadpole - improved estimate of @xmath24 . other approaches to improvement are described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the tadpole  improved estimate of @xmath5 is obtained following lepage and mackenzie  @xcite by replacing the gauge links , @xmath25 by @xmath26 we choose @xmath27 consequently , the effect of tadpole improvement on the sw action is to set @xmath28 tree ",
    "level theory should then provide more reliable estimates of @xmath29 and the critical value of @xmath30 which we denote @xmath31 ; we take @xmath32 and expect @xmath31 to be close to @xmath33 .",
    "this prescription maintains the @xmath1 improvement and it is believed that the size of the remaining discretisation error will be reduced .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section we outline the computational methods . in section iii",
    ", we explore three values of the clover coefficient at @xmath0 by including the results from the gf11 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the observables studied are : the @xmath34 and @xmath35 masses , vector pseudoscalar mass splittings , the @xmath8 parameter ( proposed by lacock and michael @xcite ) , valence @xmath36 meson masses , the spin @xmath37 and @xmath38 baryon masses and the edinburgh plot . a study is also made of possible finite size effects by computing the spectrum at a smaller lattice volume , using one value of the clover coefficient",
    ". finally , in section iv , we present our conclusions .",
    "two lattice sizes , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , at @xmath0 , were used , with 482 configurations generated on the former and 142 configurations on the latter .",
    "we used a combination of the over  relaxation ( or ) algorithm @xcite and the cabbibo ",
    "marinari ( cm ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the gauge configurations were separated by 100 compound sweeps , where a compound sweep is defined as five or sweeps followed by one cm sweep . a detailed description of the algorithms used can be found in @xcite .",
    "quark propagators were calculated at two @xmath41 values .",
    "these values were chosen so that the corresponding quark masses straddle the strange quark mass .",
    "on the larger lattice , propagators were calculated using both @xmath2 and the tadpole  improved value of @xmath3 . on the smaller lattice , propagators were calculated using the tadpole  improved value of @xmath5 only .    to increase the overlap of the operators with the ground state , all of the propagators were calculated using both a local source and a jacobi  smeared source with r.m.s .",
    "radius of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "local sinks were used for all propagators .",
    "the propagators were calculated using the minimal residual algorithm , which is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the correlators used to extract the hadron masses are listed in table  [ operator - list ] ; for further details see @xcite .",
    "we computed meson correlators using quarks degenerate and non - degenerate in mass , giving three possible mass combinations for each meson state .",
    "furthermore , each quark propagator can be either local or smeared , giving three possible correlators for each mass combination .",
    "however , we computed baryon correlators only for degenerate quark masses , using either all smeared or all local quark propagators . therefore , for each baryon state we have two mass combinations each with two types of sources . in order to maximise the sample size , the discrete time symmetry of the correlators was utilised and the data for @xmath43 $ ] averaged with the data at @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the temporal size of the lattice .",
    "these calculations were performed on the meiko i860 computing surfaces at the edinburgh parallel computing centre .",
    "we have performed multi - exponential fits of meson correlators to @xmath46 and baryon correlators to @xmath47 @xmath48 is the amplitude of the state labelled by @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is that of the ( heavier ) parity partner and @xmath51 .",
    "the following criteria for multi  exponential fits have been used :    * acceptable values for the quality of fit , q , and @xmath52 ; * stability of the result for the ground state mass ; * agreement between the result obtained using a single - exponential fit and a double - exponential fit ; * ability of of the fitting algorithm to resolve two masses .",
    "the variable @xmath53 , which is a function of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is defined  @xcite",
    "as @xmath56 it represents the probability that given @xmath57 normal , random , uncorrelated variables , with a mean of @xmath58 and unit variance , have a sum of squares which is greater than @xmath54 .",
    "an acceptable value for @xmath53 lies around @xmath59 ; a much smaller value indicates that the model used is incorrect , whereas a value approaching 1 indicates that too many parameters are being used . a criterion of stability which we used is that the mass obtained does not change noticeably when the minimum time slice of the fit was changed slightly .",
    "the parameters were determined by minimising the @xmath54 using the levenberg ",
    "marquardt algorithm @xcite .",
    "correlations between all time slices , and types of operator for simultaneous fits , were included .",
    "the covariance matrix was inverted using singular value decomposition , without eliminating any eigenvalues .",
    "the bootstrap algorithm @xcite , using 1000 bootstrap subsamples , was used to determine the 68% confidence levels , regenerating the covariance matrix for each subsample .",
    "examples of the multi  exponential fits for the pseudoscalar , vector , nucleon and @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ps-57-multi - fit ] ) to fig .",
    "( [ fig : delta-57-multi - fit ] ) .",
    "we emphasise that these are _ not _ effective mass plots , but plots of the mass obtained for a given fixed @xmath60 and varying @xmath61 . in obtaining results for the smaller lattice , despite having significantly larger statistics",
    ", it was more difficult to satisfy the above fit criteria than for the larger lattice . the pseudoscalar mass was determined using all available smearing types and a 2exponential fit .",
    "fit ranges of 312 and 316 were chosen for the smaller and larger volumes repectively . in the case of the vector ,",
    "the high statistics at the smaller volume allowed the use of both @xmath62 matrices , listed in table  [ operator - list ] , while for the larger lattice , only @xmath63 was used .",
    "all three different smearing types were used in both fits .",
    "fit ranges of 412 and 416 were used and a 2exponential fit .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : nuc-57-multi - fit ] ) there is significant second and even third state contamination for the nucleon when local and smeared operators are used in the fit .",
    "hence only those correlators calculated with smeared operators , with overlap onto the @xmath64 state , were used to determine @xmath65 .",
    "the contribution of the parity partner of eq.([eq : baryon - twopt ] ) was found to be sufficiently suppressed if @xmath60 was chosen to be @xmath66 .",
    "the fit ranges , using a 2exponential fit , were 211 and 215 .    in the case of the @xmath6 ,",
    "the higher state contamination was not as large as for the nucleon .",
    "therefore local and smeared operators were used .",
    "the fit ranges were 511 and 515 with a 2exponential fit .",
    "the masses obtained for the pseudoscalar , vector , nucleon and @xmath6 for each value of the clover coefficient and combination of quark masses , are listed in table  [ mps - c - coarse ] to table  [ mdelta - c - coarse ] .",
    "the larger lattice size corresponds to one used by the gf11 collaboration with the wilson fermion action and the same @xmath67  @xcite , so that we are also able to compare results for non - zero @xmath5 with those for @xmath4 .",
    "one expects the effect of changing @xmath5 will be more noticeable at our coarse lattice spacing than at a larger @xmath67 .",
    "the effect of reducing the physical volume to @xmath39 was also investigated , using the tadpole - improved sw action .        for small quark masses ,",
    "the bare mass of a quark on the lattice can be defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is _ a priori _ an undetermined function of @xmath67 .",
    "we use the standard extrapolation in quark mass for pseudoscalar mesons , neglecting possible logarithmic divergences described by sharpe @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 however , as noted by bhattacharya _",
    "_ @xcite and collins _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the terms which are @xmath72 can not be entirely neglected for the quark masses used in this study .",
    "a linear extrapolation in @xmath73 leads to a large @xmath52 , as can be seen in table  [ kappa - crit ] .",
    "an estimate of the systematic uncertainty was obtained by performing a quadratic fit through the three masses and a linear fit to the two lightest masses . in all the cases considered ,",
    "the deviation from the original linear fit was greater for the quadratic fit than for the linear fit to the two lightest masses .",
    "the systematic error quoted in table  [ kappa - crit ] is conservatively estimated to be the deviation of the quadratic fit from the original linear fit .",
    "we note that the value for @xmath69 is always larger when the quadratic form is employed , regardless of the clover coefficient or lattice size used .",
    "hence , results for other observables will always be quoted with an entirely positive or negative systematic error .    as can be seen from table  [ kappa - crit ] ( including the gf11@xcite data for comparison ) , @xmath69 approaches @xmath74 as @xmath5",
    "is increased from @xmath58 to @xmath75 and that @xmath31 in the tadpole improved case is closer still .      in this section ,",
    "the physical pseudoscalar and vector masses are evaluated by extrapolation and interpolation in the quark masses to the appropriate physical values .",
    "certain input parameters are necessary to do this . in particular , for mesons containing up and down valence quarks ( which are assumed to be degenerate in mass and will be referred to here as `` normal '' ) , one may use the experimental values for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( we apply a convention that experimentally determined masses are labelled with an `` m '' , while those calculated on the lattice are labelled with an `` m '' ) .",
    "effectively , one of these sets the quark mass while the other sets the lattice spacing .",
    "the vector mass extrapolation has the following form @xmath78 where logarithmic terms due to the quenched approximation have been discarded .",
    "the constant term @xmath79 corresponds to the vector mass in the chiral limit .",
    "following the procedure outlined by the gf11 collaboration , values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are determined using the physical ratio @xmath82 once again , the systematic error due to higher order corrections is estimated by quadratically fitting all three masses and performing a linear fit in the two lightest masses .",
    "the deviation due to the quadratic fit was again found to be consistently larger .",

    "( [ fig : mv - vs - mpisq ] ) .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath81 ( including the gf11 @xcite data ) are quoted in table  [ chiral - mesons ] .",

    "it is useful to compare @xmath84 with the lattice measurement of a gluonic quantity , where discretisation errors are @xmath17 and hence can be expected to be smaller .",
    "we choose sommer s force parameter , @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "we can extrapolate the gf11 values for @xmath86 versus @xmath87 to the continuum limit which yields @xmath88 this includes a correction which the gf11 collaboration have used to eliminate finite volume effects , which rounds the result down by approximately 4% . assuming that @xmath85 and the string tension , @xmath89 are related by @xmath90 and interpolating the available string tension data from @xmath91",

    "the remaining discrepancy is presumably due to the error of the quenched approximation .      as noted previously , it is useful to be able to compare lattice spectrum results with existing experimental data without an extrapolation to the chiral limit .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , defined as@xcite @xmath123 allows such a comparison .",
    "existing quenched wilson  like fermion actions yield values around @xmath124 whereas an estimate of @xmath8 using experimental data yields @xmath125 . in fig .",

    "we note that the @xmath53 values for the fit to the nucleon masses on the @xmath39 lattice are very close to 1 , which may indicate that the statistical errors are underestimated .",

    "improved sw action ) there is a significant difference in the masses of the chirally extrapolated and strange pseudoscalar and vector mesons , in the nucleon and @xmath6 masses and in the edinburgh plot .",
    "interestingly , a number of other quantities , for example @xmath136 , @xmath8 and the ratios @xmath9 and @xmath10 do not appear to change significantly as @xmath5 is changed from @xmath137 to @xmath104 . as the finite volume effects appear to be under control , and these observables have been chosen to avoid the systematic errors due to the chiral extrapolation , the possible remaining systematic errors are the effect of quenching the gauge configurations and a possibly large deviation of the mean field estimate of the clover coefficient from @xmath24 .",
    "it would therefore be very interesting then to examine the behaviour of these quantities in any future studies in full qcd under changes in the value of the clover coefficient .    in changing the volume from approximately @xmath11 to @xmath12 the mesonic observables are consistent to within one standard deviation .",
    "baryon masses are consistent to within two standard deviations .",

    "<S> we compute the light hadron mass spectrum at @xmath0 using the @xmath1-improved sheikholeslami - wohlert ( sw ) fermion action with two choices of the clover coefficient : the classical value , @xmath2 , and a mean - field or tadpole - improved estimate @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with those of the gf11 collaboration who use the wilson fermion action ( @xmath4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that changing @xmath5 from zero to 1 and 1.57 leads to significant differences in the masses of the chirally extrapolated and strange pseudoscalar and vector mesons , the nucleon , the @xmath6 , and also in the edinburgh plot . </S>",
    "<S> a number of other quantities , for example @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 do not appear to change significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the effect of changing the lattice volume from approximately @xmath11 to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the meson masses are consistent to within one standard deviation and baryon masses are consistent to within two standard deviations .    </S>"
