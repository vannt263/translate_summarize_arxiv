    "electron spin coherence in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) is a quantum effect to be exploited in emerging technologies such as spin - based electronics ( spintronics ) and quantum computation.@xcite the electron spin decoherence is a key issue for practical application of the electron spin freedom and is also of fundamental interest in mesoscopic physics and in quantum physics .",
    "the electron spin decoherence in qds , however , is yet poorly characterized . by convention ,",
    "the spin decoherence is classified into the longitudinal and the transverse parts , which correspond to the spin population flip and the zeeman energy fluctuation processes and are usually characterized by the relaxation time @xmath0 and the dephasing time @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "most current experiments are carried out on ensembles of spins , composed of either many similar qds@xcite or many repetitions of ( approximately ) identical measurements on a single qd.@xcite the ensemble measurements are subjected to the inhomogeneous broadening of the zeeman energy which results from the fluctuation of the qd size , shape and compound composition ( and in turn the electron @xmath3-factor ) and from the random distribution of the local overhauser field ( due to the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins in thermal states ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening leads to an effective dephasing time @xmath1.@xcite the three timescales characterizing the electron spin decoherence can differ by orders of magnitude usually in the order @xmath4 .",
    "for example , in a typical gaas qd at a low temperature ( @xmath5  kelvin ) and under a moderate to strong magnetic field ( @xmath6  tesla ) , the relaxation time @xmath0 can be in the order of milliseconds,@xcite the dephasing time @xmath2 is up to several microseconds,@xcite and the effective dephasing time @xmath1 can be as short as a few nanoseconds.@xcite    the issue is how to measure the characteristic times of electron spin decoherence in qds .",
    "there have been many experiments both in optics@xcite and in transport@xcite which establish the spin relaxation time @xmath0 in qds of different materials .",
    "the effective dephasing time @xmath1 is also measured for qd ensembles,@xcite giving a lower bound of @xmath2 .",
    "spin echo in microwave esr experiments is a conventional approach to measuring the spin decoherence time @xmath2 excluding the inhomogeneous broadening,@xcite which , however , is less feasible for iii - v compound quantum dots due to the ultrafast timescales in such systems ( @xmath7  sec and @xmath8  sec ) .",
    "indeed , the remarkable spin echo experiments in coupled qds done by the marcus group are performed with rather long dc voltage pulses instead of instantaneous microwave pulses.@xcite alternatively , picosecond optical pulses may be used to manipulate electron spins via raman processes@xcite and realize the spin echo , which , however , still need to overcome the difficulty of stabilizing and synchronizing picosecond pulses in microsecond time - spans . a recent experiment by greilich et al also shows that the inhomogeneous broadening effect can be filtered out from the spin coherence mode - locked by a periodic train of laser pulses.@xcite    in this paper , we will study the frequency - domain nonlinear optical spectroscopy as another approach to measuring the electron spin decoherence times .",
    "particularly , the spin dephasing rate @xmath9 is correlated to the width of ultra - narrow hole - burning peaks in fifth order differential transmission ( dt ) spectra .",
    "this hole - burning measurement of the spin dephasing time is analogous to the exploration of slow relaxation of optical coherence in atomic systems by the third - order hole - burning spectroscopy.@xcite here the fifth order nonlinearity is needed because the creation of spin coherence by raman processes involves at least two orders of optical field and hole - burning two more .",
    "the state - of - the - art spectroscopy already has the ultra - high resolution ( much better than mhz - resolution ) to resolve the slow spin decoherence in microsecond or even millisecond timescales.@xcite    the organization of this paper is as follow : after this introductory section , sec .",

    "the solution of the master equation in frequency domain is presented in appendix  [ append_master ] .",
    "the system to be studied is a semiconductor qd doped with a single electron .",
    "the geometry of the qd under an external magnetic field and optical excitation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_schematics ] ( a ) and ( c ) . the qd is assumed of a shape with small thickness in the growth direction and relatively large radius in the lateral directions , as in the usual cases of fluctuation qds and self - assembled qds.@xcite to enable the generation and manipulation of the electron spin coherence through raman processes , a magnetic field is applied along a lateral direction ( @xmath10-axis ) .",
    "the propagation directions of the pump and probe laser beams are close to the growth direction ( @xmath11-axis ) .",
    "the two electron spin states @xmath12 are split by the magnetic field with zeeman energy @xmath13 .",
    "the strong confinement along the @xmath11-axis induces a large splitting between the heavy hole and the light hole states , thus the relevant exciton states are the ground trion states @xmath14 and @xmath15 which consist of two electrons ( including the doped one and one created by optical excitation ) in the singlet spin state and one heavy hole in the spin state @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( quantized along the @xmath11-axis with nearly zero zeeman splitting ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , we can also neglect the excitation of higher lying trions , bi - exciton and multi - exciton states since the energy of adding an exciton in each case is well separated from energy of the lowest trion states .",
    "the selection rules for the optical transitions are determined by the ( approximate ) conservation of the angular momentum along the growth direction so that a circularly polarized light with polarization @xmath18 or @xmath19 connects the two electron spin states to the trion state @xmath14 or @xmath20 , respectively [ see fig .",

    "the relaxation processes in the system are parameterized by the exciton recombination rate @xmath21 , the exciton dephasing rate @xmath22 , the spin relaxation rate @xmath23 , and the spin dephasing rate @xmath9 .",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening leads to a random component @xmath24 to the zeeman splitting : @xmath25 , which is assumed of gaussian distribution @xmath26 .",
    "the hole spin relaxation is neglected since it is extremely slow when the hole is confined in the trion states.@xcite the theory presented here can be extended straightforwardly to include the hole spin relaxation , the light - hole states , the hole mixing effect ( which leads to the imperfection in the selection rules ) , the multi - exciton states , the inhomogeneous broadening of the trion states , and so on , but we expect no qualitative modification of the resonance features related to the electron spin coherence in the nonlinear optical spectra . for the interests of simplicity",
    ", we shall consider only @xmath27-polarized optical field ( extension to other polarization configurations may provide some flexibility for experiments and is trivial in the theoretical part ) .",
