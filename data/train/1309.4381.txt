    "the current standard cosmological scenario , supported by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and of the large - scale structure ( lss ) , appears to be consistent with the @xmath4cdm concordance model , where the universe is dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and its accelerating expansion driven by a cosmological constant @xmath4 or dark energy ( de ) .",
    "a recent strong support of this paradigm has been presented by park et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who was able to prove that observed high- and low - density lsss have the richness / volume and size distributions consistent with the @xmath4cdm universe .",
    "in addition , the primordial density perturbations from which halos and galaxies form are assumed to be a gaussian random field , as predicted by inflationary theories ( guth 1981 ; linde 1982 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) ; state - of - the - art data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 , komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; stoughton et al . 2002 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) or the wigglez survey ( blake et al . 2011 ) are still favoring this hypothesis .",
    "however , some claims or hints of primordial non - gaussianity have recently appeared in the literature ( jeong & smoot 2007 ; yadav & wandelt 2008 ; komatsu et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ; slosar et al . 2008 ; smidt et al . 2010 ) , and challenged the validity of the simplest inflationary paradigm .",
    "indeed , if detected , primordial non - gaussianity would indicate a structure formation scenario different from the concordance cosmological model , and force us to revise the physics of the very early universe  along with several aspects of the lss dynamics ( but see also hwang 2012 for a more general discussion on modern cosmology ) .    to this end , topology - related statistics offer a precious benchmark for testing the underlying gaussianity of the initial density field , since topology can be regarded as an important physical property of the matter density that can be compared with predictions of the simplest inflationary models , where gaussian random phase initial conditions are generated from quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field in the early universe .",
    "in addition , topology measured at the present epoch should reflect that of the initial conditions on smoothing scales considerably larger than the correlation length , because fluctuations which are still in linear regime maintain their initial topology ( see gott et al .",
    "1987 , who confirmed this property with @xmath0-body simulations ) ; this fact allows one to test directly the gaussian paradigm , and permits to use topology as a cosmic standard ruler ( park & kim 2010 ) .    from the theoretical side , since the pioneering work of gott et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , a variety of analytic and numerical tools to analyze observational and simulated data for measuring topology have long been developed  mainly using the genus statistics to quantify the topology of isodensity contours ( gott et al .",
    "1987 , 1989 ; hamilton et al . 1986 ; vogeley et al . 1994 ; park et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "in particular , the analytic prediction for the genus curve of a gaussian field in linear regime is well - known ( gott et al .",
    "1986 ) , and its perturbative expression in the weakly nonlinear regime has also been obtained ( matsubara 1994 ) ; this lognormal model turned out to be a good empirical approximation in the strongly nonlinear regime ( hikage et al .",
    "2002 ) . along with analytic tools ,",
    "large - volume @xmath0-body simulations are routinely used to quantify several systematics which affect the genus curve , such as finite pixel size , sparse sampling , peculiar velocity distortions in redshift space or survey boundaries .",
    "the ability to correct for these effects is essential , as the remaining small deviations from the random phase curve give important information about the physics connected with galaxy formation , nonlinear gravitational clustering , and primordial non - gaussianity  if any .",
    "in fact , on smaller scales nonlinear gravitational evolution and biased galaxy formation make the topology of the observed galaxy distribution deviate from the gaussian form , even if the initial conditions were gaussian - distributed . using fractional volume rather than direct density threshold as the independent variable in topology analysis mitigates but does not fully eliminate these nonlinear and biasing effects ( weinberg et al .",
    "1987 ; melott et al .",
    "ultimately , all the secondary non - gaussianities need to be disentangled from the primordial contribution , and this can now be done very accurately , without assuming any ` a priori ' model for the underlying signal .    from the observational side ,",
    "a long list of studies have been pursued on a variety of datasets ( see for example park , gott , & da costa 1992 ; park et al .",
    "1992 , 2005b ; park , gott , & choi 2001 ; moore et al .",

    "2007 , 2009 ; gott et al 2008 , 2009 ; choi et al .",
    "they focused on characterizing the three - dimensional topology , and showed that , depending on the considered scale , topology is useful in constraining both cosmological parameters and the galaxy formation mechanism .",
    "for example , park et al .",
    "( 2005b ) characterized the topology of the sdss main galaxy sample from the nyu value added galaxy catalog ( nyu vagc ; blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) , which has similar sky coverage as the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) , and presented the first clear demonstration of luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering topology ( i.e. brighter galaxies show a stronger signal of meatball topology ) ; more recently , gott et al .",
    "( 2009 ) measured the three - dimensional lss topology of the sdss dr4plus lrg sample from the nyu vagc ( a subsample of the sdss dr5 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) and found strong consistency with gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations . in the latter case ,",
    "the large sample size available allowed topology to be an important tool for testing galaxy formation models .",
    "also , choi et al . (",
    "2010 ) measured the topology of the main galaxy distribution using the sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al . 2009",
    "; choi , han , & kim 2010 ) , studied the scale - dependent topology bias , and examined the dependence of galaxy clustering topology on galaxy properties ( i.e. luminosity , morphology , color ) at different smoothing scales .",
    "the large volume - limited sample enabled an unprecedented measurement of the genus curve , with an amplitude of @xmath5 at 6 @xmath3mpc smoothing scale and an estimated uncertainty of 4.8@xmath6 , including all systematics and cosmic variance .",
    "in addition , choi et al . (",
    "2010 ) detected deviations of the genus curve from gaussianity , interpreted as the fact that voids and superclusters are more connected and their sizes are larger than those expected for gaussian fields .",
    "the same authors then used these results to test five different galaxy formation models , which indeed are tuned to reproduce the two - point correlation function and the luminosity function but not high - order statistics , and found significant discrepancies : none of the models could reproduce all the aspects of the observed clustering topology .    while the significant discrepancies in the sdss dr7 galaxy clustering topology at nonlinear scales found by choi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) are mainly driven by the inaccuracy of galaxy formation models , a cleaner problem is to consider the topology of lrgs instead  which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "this is because the lrg sample covers a much larger and deeper volume ( i.e. it allows one to observe topology at the largest scales ) , essentially in the linear regime .",
    "in addition , lrgs are particularly useful in refining cosmological parameters ( tegmark et al . 2006 ) , and are expected to play an important role in characterizing de through the ratio of de pressure to energy density ( see bassett et al .",
    "2005 ; eisenstein et al . 2005 ; percival et al .",
    "a number of previous analyses have addressed the clustering of lrgs , especially in relation to baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) science ( see for instance ross et al . 2012 , and references therein ) . on the contrary ,",
    "fewer studies have been based on topology . among those ,",
    "gott et al . ( 2009 ) measured the three - dimensional genus topology of lrgs , using two volume - limited samples constructed from the sdss dr4plus sample , i.e. a dense shallow sample with @xmath7 smoothing , and a sparse deep sample with @xmath8 smoothing .",
    "the amplitude of the genus curve was found to reach about 167 with a @xmath9 uncertainty at @xmath7 scale .",
    "a major result of their study was that topology of lrgs in the sdss agrees very well with that of mock galaxies in the @xmath4cdm universe with the same cosmological parameters : small distortions in the genus curve , expected from nonlinear biasing and gravitational effects , are well explained by @xmath0-body simulations with a subhalo finding technique adopted to locate lrgs .",
    "this suggests that the formation of lrgs can be modeled well without any free - fitting parameters .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to characterize the three - dimensional genus topology of spectroscopic lrgs using the sdss dr7 catalog , improving on the previous results presented by gott et al .",
    "in particular , we strive to carefully model and remove all known systematics which affect the observed genus ( i.e. finite pixel size , survey boundary , radial and angular selection function and shot noise ) , and estimate the uncertainties in the measured genus accurately .",
    "this is achieved by comparing our measurements with 81 mock sdss lrg surveys along the past light cone constructed from the horizon run 3 ( hr3 ; kim et al .",
    "2011 ) , one of the largest @xmath0-body simulations to date that evolved @xmath1 particles in a @xmath2mpc size box .",
    "our main result for the observed genus curve is shown in figure  [ fig : main_result ] ( red solid line ) , and compared with a previous topology measurement on the sdss dr4plus dataset ( blue solid line ; gott et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the main point of the figure is to show the dramatic increase in amplitude of the genus curve over the two different datasets ( i.e. the sdss dr4plus versus the sdss dr7 ) in the same redshift range from 0.16 to 0.36 and rest - frame @xmath10-band absolute magnitudes of @xmath11 , due to the much larger volume that is covered .",
    "in fact , we find the genus amplitude to reach 285 with an uncertainty of 4.0% at @xmath12 gaussian smoothing scale including cosmic variance ( the most accurate measurement to date ) , while gott et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found the genus curve to reach about 167 with a @xmath9 uncertainty at @xmath7 smoothing scale ; for comparison with a different galaxy population , park et al .",
    "( 2005b ) and choi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported an uncertainty of @xmath13 and @xmath14 at 5@xmath3mpc and 6@xmath3mpc scales , respectively , for the genus obtained from the main galaxy sample of the sdss dr3 and dr7 .",
    "we will return to this measurement in great detail in section  [ sec : genus_top ] , while in a forthcoming publication we interpret the deviation of the genus curve from the expected gaussian prediction in the context of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "the layout of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we present the main theoretical framework of this study ; in particular , we review the genus statistics for gaussian fields and discuss how to extend the formalism for non - gaussian fields . in section  [ sec : data_methods ] , we describe the sdss lrg sample used for our measurements and the methodology applied to the observational data . in section",

    "we begin by revisiting the basic theory of the genus for gaussian fields and by introducing some genus - related statistics .",
    "we also briefly review the formalism for describing the non - gaussian effect on the genus curve in the weakly nonlinear regime according to second - order perturbation theory , originally derived by matsubara ( 1994 , 2003 ) .",
    "we will later compare the theory outlined here with results from the sdss dr7 lrg dataset , and with measurements from simulated lrg sample .",
    "the full extension to non - gaussian fields with the inclusion of primordial non - gaussianity will be presented and discussed in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the genus is a measurement of the topology of isodensity contour surfaces in a smoothed galaxy field ( gott et al .",
    "1987 ) . in mathematical terms",
    ", it is defined as follows .",
    "consider a three - dimensional gaussian random field @xmath15 with @xmath16 the spatial coordinate , and measure the topology of the excursion regions where @xmath17 is equal to , or is above a given threshold level @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the mean of the field @xmath17 , @xmath20 its root mean square ( @xmath21 ) value , and @xmath22 .",
    "denote with @xmath23 the space which contains the set of the excursion regions ( i.e. a 3-manifold subset ) , and indicate its boundaries with @xmath24 ( i.e. a 2-manifold subset ) .",
    "for each component @xmath25 of @xmath24 , according to the gauss - bonnet theorem , the mathematical genus satisfies the following relation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the euler characteristic of the surface of the three - dimensional excursion region ( i.e. the integrated gaussian curvature of the surface ) .",
    "hence , the total genus of the boundary @xmath24 becomes @xmath28 where @xmath0 is the number of components of @xmath24  see park et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for a full derivation of the previous formula .",
    "in cosmology , the standard definition of genus slightly differs from the previous mathematical one , since the genus is defined as the number of holes minus the number of isolated regions in the isodensity contour surfaces , at a given threshold level @xmath29 .",
    "namely , @xmath30 the relation between the two definitions is simply expressed by @xmath31 , where @xmath0 has been defined above . for further insights on topological invariants , and for the mathematical connection between the cosmological genus and the betti numbers for excursion sets of gaussian random fields , we refer the reader to park et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .    in the case of gaussian fields , the genus per unit volume @xmath32 as a function of density threshold level @xmath29 is known ( i.e. doroshkevich 1970 ; adler 1981 ; hamilton , gott , & weinberg 1986 ) : @xmath33 the amplitude @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 while the spectral moments of the fields , @xmath36 , are computed from @xmath37 in the previous relation , @xmath38 is the power spectrum smoothed on a scale @xmath39 by a window function @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the matter power spectrum . in particular , in this study we adopt a gaussian smoothing of the form @xmath43 .",
    "note also that , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the variance of the fluctuating field , while @xmath45 is the variance of its derivative when @xmath46 .    to separate the variation in topology from the change of the one - point density distribution , in this work we also measure the genus as a function of the volume - fraction threshold @xmath47 ( as opposed to the direct density threshold @xmath29 )",
    "this parameter defines the density contour surface such that the volume fraction @xmath48 in the high density region is the same as the volume fraction in a gaussian random field contour surface having @xmath49 , namely : @xmath50      after correcting for known systematics , deviations of the observed genus curve from the gaussian expectation ( i.e. eq .",
    "[ eq_genus_standard ] ) are due to nonlinear gravitational evolution and non - gaussianity of the primordial density field .",
    "a number of studies in the literature have already addressed the impact of non - gaussianity on the genus curve ( see for example weinberg et al .",
    "1987 ; park & gott 1991 ; park , kim , & gott 2005a ) . in",
    "what follows , we briefly discuss the non - gaussian effect on the genus curve caused by nonlinear gravitational evolution in the weakly nonlinear regime ( which tends to distort the gaussian expectation for the genus statistic ) , in the context of second - order perturbation theory  along the lines of matsubara ( 1994 , 2003 ) .",
    "more details on the non - gaussian modifications of the genus curve will be presented in young - rae kim et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    to first order in @xmath20 , the nonlinear correction that one must apply to the genus curve due to gravitational evolution is an odd function of the threshold @xmath29 . hence , this correction causes a shift and an asymmetry between high- and low - density regions , with no change in the amplitude at @xmath51 .    in particular , when we use a threshold rescaled by a volume fraction of the smoothed field , @xmath47 , the genus of the matter density field per unit volume ",
    "expanded to first order in mass variance @xmath20  can be written as a sum of a gaussian term @xmath52 plus a non - gaussian term @xmath53 , namely : @xmath54 the gaussian part is expressed by @xmath55 while the non - gaussian term is given by ( young - rae kim et al . , in preparation ) : @xmath56\\sigma_{0}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the previous equations , @xmath57 are hermite polynomials , and in particular @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "also , the various @xmath64 , @xmath65 , are skewness parameters obtained by integrating the bispectrum @xmath66 over @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( see eq .",
    "61 - 64 in matsubara 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , the bispectrum can be given in terms of the nonlinear contributions from nonlinear gravitational evolution , and also primordial non - gaussianity  an aspect that we do not consider here ( but see appendix b in hikage et al .",
    "note that the non - gaussian part @xmath53 only appears with terms of the form @xmath69 . assuming galaxy biasing local and deterministic in the weakly nonlinear regime , the skewness parameters of the galaxy bispectrum , @xmath70 , is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are bias parameters . the non - gaussian term @xmath53 in equation  [ eq : matsubara ] only appears as combinations of the form @xmath74 when the biased variance at first order is then given by @xmath75 ; therefore",
    ", the non - gaussian correction of the galaxy density field is exactly the same as the one of the unbiased mass density field in equation  [ eq : matsubara ]  hence independent of the bias parameter .",
    "this can be considered as an advantage of the volume fraction threshold , as opposed to the direct density threshold ( see matsubara 2003 for more details ) .",
    "the measured genus curve can be compared with predictions of the simplest inflationary models , which assume gaussian random phase initial conditions ( and so with eq .",
    "[ eq_genus_standard ] ) .",
    "however , even if the initial conditions were perfectly gaussian , small deviations from gaussianity are expected because of systematic effects ( for example shot noise or redshift - space distortions ) , and because of the physics connected with galaxy formation , nonlinear gravitational evolution , and primordial non - gaussianity ( if any ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to quantify even small departures from gaussianity from the observed genus .",
    "this is done by parametrizing the genus curve with several derived quantities . in what follows ,",
    "we consider measurements as a function of the volume fraction threshold @xmath47 , and introduce four genus - related statistics .",
    "the first quantity is simply the best - fit genus amplitude @xmath76 , measured by a least - squares fit of the theoretical random phase curve to the data considering only the range @xmath77 . in principle",
    ", its value is given by equation  [ eq_genus_amplitude ] , but the measured one is always lower because of nonlinear clustering and biasing due to coalescence of structures ( park & gott 1991 ; vogeley et al .",
    "1994 ; canavezes et al . 1998 ; gott et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the second quantity is the shift parameter @xmath78 , defined as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the observed and best - fit gaussian genus curves  both given by equation [ eq_genus_standard ] , but in the former case with the observed amplitude @xmath82 and in the latter with the best - fit one , @xmath76 , as explained in park et al .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 controls the horizontal shifts of the central part of the genus curve . for a density field dominated by voids , @xmath78 is positive and we say that the density field has a `` bubble - like '' topology . for a cluster - dominated field",
    ", @xmath78 is negative and we say that the field has a `` meatball - like '' topology .",
    "we then further introduce two additional quantities , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which measure the abundances of clusters ( c ) and voids ( v ) , respectively , relative to the expectations for a gaussian random field .",
    "they are defined by the following relation @xmath85 where the integration intervals are @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath84 ( park , gott , & choi 2001 ; park , kim , & gott 2005a ) .",
    "these intervals are centered near the minima of the gaussian genus curve ( i.e. @xmath89 ) , far away from the thresholds where the genus is often affected by the shift phenomenon .",
    "the previous intervals also exclude extreme thresholds , where for low density regions @xmath47 is very sensitive to the exact density value .",
    "these parameters are defined so that the condition @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) implies that more independent clusters ( voids ) are observed , with respect to those predicted by a gaussian field at a fixed volume fraction . on the opposite",
    ", @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) means that fewer independent clusters ( voids ) are seen .",
    "the effects of gravitational evolution , galaxy biasing , and cosmology dependence on the statistics defined by @xmath78 , @xmath84 , and @xmath83  as a function of the smoothing scale  have been addressed in detail by park , kim , & gott ( 2005a ) ; we refer to their study for more details .",
    "in this section we briefly describe our lrg sample obtained from the sdss dr7 , along with the methodology applied to the observational dataset . the genus computed from the lrg sample and its related statistics",

    "2013 ) , and therefore they should get different weights if the sampling varies with luminosity  to avoid the clustering mismatch . the problem becomes more serious when galaxy luminosity or mass are used as weights , to obtain the galaxy luminosity density or the mass density field , respectively .",
    "in particular , when the sampling in luminosity or mass varies with redshift , the resulting luminosity or mass density will have different mean values across different redshift bins , even if the galaxy number density is matched .",
    "therefore , one should also consider the radial density gradient .    for the construction of our galaxy mass and number density fields from the observed lrg sample , we devise a new weighting scheme ( called ` luminosity function matching ' ) which properly accounts for the sampling rate variations depending on the location of the galaxy both in redshift and absolute magnitude space , variations that are caused by the lrg target selection procedure . in",

    "in this section we briefly describe the horizon run 3 @xmath0-body simulation , and the procedure to construct the sdss dr7 mock lrg samples from the simulation output .",
    "we will then compare numerical results and measurements from data in section [ sec : genus_top ] .",
    "the mock surveys will also be used to quantify several nonlinearities due to systematics which affect the genus curve : correcting for these effects allows one to accurately recover the topology of the underlying matter , as we will present in section [ sec : genus_sys ] .",
    "the horizon run 3 ( hr3 ; kim et al .",
    "2011 ) is one of the largest @xmath0-body simulations to date , made using @xmath131 billion particles , spanning a volume of @xmath132gpc)@xmath133  which is over 8800 times the volume of the millennium run ( springel et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the particle mass is down to @xmath134 , allowing to resolve galaxy - size halos with mean particle separation of @xmath135mpc .",
    "the simulation is based on the @xmath4cdm cosmology , with parameters fixed by the wmap 5-year data ( komatsu et al .",
    "the linear power spectrum used is obtained with the camb source ( http://camb.info/sources ) , which provides a better measurement of the bao scale .",
    "the simulation starts at @xmath136 , and is evolved till the present epoch with 600 global time steps .",
    "the code used for the run is an improved version of the grid - of - oct - trees - particle - mesh code ( gotpm ) , originally devised by dubinski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; a new procedure has been implemented , in order to describe more accurately the particle positions using single precision .    in the hr3",
    ", halos are first identified via a standard friend - of - friend ( fof ) procedure .",
    "then subhalos are found  out of fof halos  with a subhalo finding technique developed by kim & park ( 2006 ) and kim , park , & choi ( 2008 ) .",
    "this method allows one to identify physically self - bound ( psb ) dark matter subhalos not tidally disrupted by larger structures at the desired epoch .",
    "in particular , lrgs are identified as the most massive dark matter subhalos . to make the comparison with observational data",
    ", we saved the particle positions and velocities along the past light cone for 27 separated observers , and found subhalos in the past light cone surface from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .    from each simulated light cone",
    ", we made 3 mock samples using exactly the same survey mask and angular selection function of the sdss sample .",
    "in addition , we applied the same smoothing length as for the observational case . in total , we are able to obtain 81 non - overlapping mock samples , thanks to the enormous volume of the hr3 .",
    "to this end , we note that the ability to simulate big volumes is essential ( particularly for the lrg distribution ) , since larger volumes allow one to model more accurately the true power at large scales and the corresponding power spectrum .",
    "a large box size will guarantee small statistical errors in power spectrum estimates , so that the acoustic peak scale can be measured with an accuracy better than @xmath139 , and the genus curve characterized with unprecedented statistical significance .",
    "a crucial step in our analysis is the construction of realistic mock lrg samples .",
    "this requires the ability to mimic all the observational biases , such as survey boundary , radial and angular selection function , redshift space distortions and so forth . to build the various simulated catalogs ,",
    "27 observers were placed in the hr3 box , each covering the redshift range @xmath140 without overlaps : this means that the survey volumes are totally independent .",
    "in addition , the lrg mocks are made so that they span exactly the same range in absolute magnitude as the observational sample ; hence , the number of galaxies in each mock is nearly equal to the observed one ( at the percentage level accuracy ) .",
    "moreover , the simulated galaxies should be observed in redshift space along the past light cone with the same radial and angular selection function of the observational sample , and also with the same selection function in absolute magnitude space as in the real observation .",
    "figure [ fig : isosurface_mock ] shows a three - dimensional example of the simulated lrg number density field obtained from the hr3 , smoothed with a gaussian filter at @xmath141 scale . the plot is the equivalent of figure [ fig : isosurface ] , but now for the lrg mock samples constructed from the hr3 simulation .",
    "again , the left panels display three representative density contours enclosing low - density regions , which occupy respectively @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ; top ) , @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ; intermediate ) , and @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ; bottom ) of the sample volume . the same thresholds , but now with positive signs and so for high - density regions ( i.e. @xmath148 , top ; @xmath149 , intermediate ; @xmath147 , bottom ) , are shown in the right panels .    since we apply identical techniques both to the sdss lrg sample and to the lrg mock surveys",
    ", we expect the results of the analysis to be identical across datasets  within statistical variations  if the simulations are correctly modeling the distribution of galaxies . in what follows ,",
    "we describe in more detail how to build the sdss dr7 mock lrg samples from the hr3 simulation output .",
    "results from our procedure confirm that we are correctly modeling the lrg distribution ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : lfmock ] and [ fig : ndenhist_mock ] ) .",
    "the major steps of the construction process are summarized next .",
    "a.   locate 27 observers in the hr3 simulation box , and save all dark halos along the past light cone of the observer during the simulation , in the redshift range @xmath150 . from each light cone data ,",
    "make 3 mock surveys using exactly the same survey mask and angular selection function as for the sdss volume - limited sample .",
    "b.   apply a proper correction to make the halo mass function uniform in redshift .",
    "in fact , in the hr3 simulation the minimum mass limit of subhalos that can have lrgs with constant observed number density varies as a function of redshift ( see fig .  6 in kim",
    "et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this leads to the following relation ; @xmath151 .",
    "the correction one needs to apply to the halo mass at an arbitrary redshift @xmath96 is then given by the ratio @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the minimum halo mass at a median redshift of @xmath154 in the reference redshift bin ( recall the procedure described in section  [ sec : mden ] , and the chosen reference redshift interval ) .",
    "c.   populate dark matter halos with galaxies using a suitable correspondence scheme .",
    "in essence , to connect galaxies with halos one needs to make an assumption on the relation between galaxy luminosity and halo mass .",
    "a widely - used approach is the subhalo abundance matching , where more luminous galaxies are assigned to more massive haloes ( kravtsov et al .",
    "2004 ; tasitsiomi et al .",
    "2004 ; vale & ostriker 2006 ; conroy & wechsler 2009 ; guo et al . 2010 ; behroozi et al . 2010 ; kim , park & choi 2008 ) .",
    "this scheme assumes that halos with mass above a certain threshold and with a given mean number density correspond to galaxies with luminosity or mass above a certain threshold and having the same mean halo number density .",
    "for our mocks , we apply the halo - galaxy one - to - one monotonic correspondence model ( hgc ) of kim , park , & choi ( 2008 ) which extends the subhalo abundance matching procedure : there is one and only one galaxy in each subhalo , and a more massive subhalo hosts a more luminous galaxy .",
    "the mapping @xmath127 is shown in figure [ fig : mag2mass ] .",
    "this correspondence scheme allows us to assign a luminosity to each lrg mock galaxy , and to compute galaxy masses ( see also the end of sec .  [",
    "sec : mden ] ) .",
    "d.   account for the effects of the color - dependent luminosity cut imposed by the sdss lrg volume - limited sample selection criteria , both in redshift and luminosity space , which reduces the sampling density ( see again sec .  [",
    "sec : mden ] ) . in order to do so , we discard mock galaxies with a rejection probability given by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is derived from the observed sample ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : w ] ) .",
    "our procedure successfully reproduces the dependence of the lrg sampling rate on luminosity and redshift as in the sdss lrg sample .",
    "this is shown in figures  [ fig : lfmock ] and [ fig : ndenhist_mock ] , the corresponding counterparts of figures  [ fig : lf ] and [ fig : ndenhist ] , respectively , obtained from simulated samples .",
    "in particular , figure  [ fig : lfmock ] displays the luminosity function computed at different redshift bins from one of our lrg mocks . to facilitate the comparison with the actual sdss data , open circles in the figure are luminosity function measurements derived from the sdss lrg sample in the reference redshift bin @xmath157  as in figure  [ fig : lf ] , see section  [ sec : mden ] .",
    "clearly , the simulated results agree very well with observational measurements in terms of matching the luminosity function . to this end , figure  [ fig : ndenhist_mock ] shows the comoving number density of sdss mock lrgs averaged over all the 81 mock samples , as a function of redshift ( black dashed line ) .",
    "solid line shows the radial distribution obtained by weighting each galaxy with @xmath121 .",
    "colored thin lines show results of six arbitrary mock surveys . filled and open circles in the figure are analogous measurements derived from the sdss lrg sample  as in figure [ fig : ndenhist ] .",
    "the weighting scheme used is explained in section [ sec : mden ] . even in this case , the plot confirms the correctness of our modeling procedure : our mocks have the same sampling rate in redshift as the observed sdss lrg sample .",
    "in this section we present results for the genus measured from the sdss dr7 lrg sample , and from our lrg mocks obtained from the hr3 lcdm simulation . in both cases , we compute the genus curves using the mass weighted density field and the number density field  although later on we will only use the number density . by contrasting observational results against mock measurements which assume gaussian initial conditions , we detect significant non - gaussian deviations of the observed genus curve from theoretical expectations .",
    "we then further quantify these discrepancies by introducing a new statistical test .",
    "a large part of the non - gaussian deviations is caused by systematics , and we address their impact on the genus curve in section [ sec : genus_sys ] .      in sections  [ sec : mden ] and  [",
    "sec : mock ] we constructed the mass weighted density field and the number density field in order to compute the genus .",
    "this is because jee et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the halo mass density has a much tighter ( and simpler ) relation with the underlying matter density than the halo number density .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by park , kim , & park ( 2010 ) , in relation to the gravitational shear field . to this end",
    ", figure  [ fig : mgplot ] shows the genus curves derived from the mass density and number density fields , as a function of the volume fraction , @xmath47 .",
    "no corrections for systematics are yet applied .",
    "we smooth our density field ( either the mass weighted or the number density one ) with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath158 at a pixel size of @xmath159 . to minimize any nonlinearity introduced by the choice of the pixel dimension",
    ", we use the smallest possible pixel size we can afford . in the figure ,",
    "red thick solid lines are used for the number density field , and black thin lines are for the mass weighted density field .    in particular",
    ", the top panel shows our measurements averaged from 81 mock lrg samples , where we also plot the genus curve of the dark matter distribution in real space using the full simulation cube  with the dotted green line .",
    "the difference between halo and matter density field curves are mostly due to halo biasing and discrete sampling of the halo density field ( i.e. shot noise ) . the genus amplitude measured from the halo mass weighted density field is lower than the one obtained from the halo number density field .",
    "this is consistent with the result of seljak , hamaus , & desjacques ( 2009 ) ; namely , weighting halo galaxies by halo mass can significantly suppress shot noise .",
    "the bottom panel shows similar measurements from the sdss lrg sample . to date , these are the best measurements of the genus curve from the sdss survey catalog . in table  [",
    "tab : mgplot_genus ] of appendix  [ sec : genus_curves ] , the genus values are given as a function of the volume - fraction threshold level .",
    "in particular , the genus amplitude obtained from the number density field is equal to @xmath160 , with a @xmath161 error including all systematic effects such as finite pixel size , survey boundary , radial and angular selection functions and sparse sampling ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : main_result ] ) .",
    "the errorbars in the figure are the @xmath162 deviations computed from 81 independent mock samples .",
    "although the shape of the genus curve does not depend on the weighting scheme as much as its amplitude , results from simulations reveal that the mass weighted density field tends to show more ` meatball'-shifted topology and more isolated clusters . in table",
    "[ tab : mgplot ] we report the details of the genus - related statistics ( see sec .

    "all these values are not bias - corrected .",
    "uncertainty limits are estimated for 81 mock samples .",
    "deviations of the genus curves from the gaussian expectation are quantified by @xmath78 , @xmath84 and @xmath83 .",
    "[ tab : mgplot ]    from figure  [ fig : mgplot ] and from the results for the genus - related statistics , it is evident that in the mock measurements low - density regions are definitely less affected by the weighting scheme . instead",
    ", the weighting scheme does not introduce any change in the genus amplitude derived from the observational sample , and the mass weighted density field still produces more isolated clusters .",
    "this finding clearly points towards the existence of a significant amount of scatter in the relation between galaxy observables and their underlying halos ; hence , one needs to gain a better understanding of the connection between galaxies and their dark matter halos , and of the galaxy formation process in general . in this paper , hereafter we will adopt the use of number density instead of the mass weighted density , for simplicity .",
    "overall , the hgc galaxy assignment scheme of kim , park , & choi ( 2008 ) is able to match well the observed amplitudes and shapes of the corresponding genus curves .",
    "in fact , from table  [ tab : mgplot ] , one can notice that the values obtained for @xmath184 , @xmath84 and @xmath83 from the simulated lrg samples agree well  within the quoted uncertainties  with those measured from the observational sample .",
    "however , we detect some significant discrepancies between mocks and observations for @xmath84 in the lower density regions beyond the integration intervals quoted in section  [ sec : grs ] ( i.e. @xmath185 )  see indeed the difference between the red and grey lines in figure  [ fig : main_result ] .",
    "we also detect some discrepancies for the observed and predicted genus amplitudes .",
    "to estimate quantitatively the statistical significance of these discrepancies , we use the following method .",
    "first , we calculate the differences between the genus curve of each individual mock sample and the curve obtained by averaging all the 81 mock samples ; we do this at three different intervals , i.e. @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",
    "we then plot the integrals of these differences as histograms in figure  [ fig : gstats_nden ] . finally , we place in the same plot our measurements obtained from the sdss sample at the corresponding threshold intervals , indicated with triangular symbols . here",
    "we measured genus curves from the number density fields of the samples .",
    "as one can infer from the figure ( with a significance level of 90% ) , departures from gaussianity are seen near the mean density regions , and in low - density regions ( i.e. in the interval @xmath189 ) .",
    "the radical difference between the genus curves of the observational and simulated data in low - density regions shows that topology is highly sensitive to the connectivity of voids . in the next part",
    ", we will address the key role played by systematics on the genus curve which will explain some of the discrepancies , and show how to accurately correct for their effects to recover the topology of the underlying matter . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we provide an interpretation of the remaining deviations ( i.e. after correcting for known systematics ) in the context of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the known systematics which affect the genus curve .",
    "we then test and quantify their impact on the genus using the genus - related statistics presented in section [ sec : grs ] , with the help of mock lrg samples ( section [ sec : mock ] ) , and show how to correct for their effects . by applying those corrections , we obtain the most accurate constraint on the genus amplitude to date , which significantly improves on our previous measurements . in particular , figures [ fig : gplot ] and [ fig : gplotdiff ] are among the most important results of our paper .      as anticipated in section [ sec : grs ] , even if the initial conditions were perfectly gaussian , small deviations from gaussianity are expected because of systematics . since systematics directly impact the shape and amplitude of the genus curve , it is imperative to be able to quantify and correct for their effects .",
    "this can now be done quite accurately , with the help of realistic mock catalogs such as those constructed from the hr3 ( section [ sec : mock ] ) .",
    "broadly speaking , systematics that cause non - gaussian deviations in the genus curve can be classified into three main classes : those due to the observational or analysis strategy , those due to statistics , and those of cosmological origin .",
    "finite pixel size effects , survey boundary mask , radial and angular selection function , past light cone gradient , and initial conditions of the simulations belong to the first class .",
    "shot noise or sparse sampling and cosmic variance are of statistical origin , while galaxy biasing , nonlinear gravitational evolution , and redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) are related to cosmology . sometimes , but",
    "this depends on the chosen terminology , the last class is not considered as a systematic effect . here",
    ", we broadly term all these three classes as systematic biases on the genus curve .",
    "clearly , several of the previously mentioned effects are connected , and so one needs to remove them simultaneously . in the absence of other known systematics , an eventual residual of non - gaussianity ( after applying the corrections mentioned above ) has to be ascribed to a primordial origin . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss in particular the nonlinear gravitational evolution , and the effects of galaxy bias and past light cone on the genus .",
    "more details on the full modeling of systematics in topology measurements will be presented in young - rae kim et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .      in this work",
    "we perform similar corrections as those applied by choi et al .",

    "the overall goal is to remove the nonlinear systematics in the observed sample step - by - step , as well as to estimate the genus curve of the underlying matter density field using a set of mock samples .",
    "we first consider the effect of nonlinear gravitational evolution on the genus curve , measured from our mock lrg samples  along with survey mask and initial condition effects .",

    "<S> we present measurements of the genus topology of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 catalog , with unprecedented statistical significance . to estimate the uncertainties in the measured genus , we construct 81 mock sdss lrg surveys along the past light cone from the horizon run 3 , one of the largest @xmath0-body simulations to date that evolved @xmath1 particles in a @xmath2mpc size box . </S>",
    "<S> after carefully modeling and removing all known systematic effects due to finite pixel size , survey boundary , radial and angular selection functions , shot noise and galaxy biasing , we find the observed genus amplitude to reach 272 at 22  @xmath3mpc smoothing scale with an uncertainty of 4.2% ; the estimated error fully incorporates cosmic variance . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most accurate constraint of the genus amplitude to date , which significantly improves on our previous results . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the shape of the genus curve agrees very well with the mean topology of the sdss lrg mock surveys in the @xmath4cdm universe . </S>",
    "<S> however , comparison with simulations also shows small deviations of the observed genus curve from the theoretical expectation for gaussian initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> while these discrepancies are mainly driven by known systematic effects such as those of shot noise and redshift - space distortions , they do contain important cosmological information on the physical effects connected with galaxy formation , gravitational evolution and primordial non - gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> we address here the key role played by systematics on the genus curve , and show how to accurately correct for their effects to recover the topology of the underlying matter . in a forthcoming paper , we provide an interpretation of those deviations in the context of the local model of non - gaussianity . </S>"
