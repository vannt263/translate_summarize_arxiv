    "the observation of neutrino masses and mixing is well established in the past decade or so  @xcite . however , the absolute scale of neutrino masses is still uncertain , and the pattern of neutrino mixing angles is also a mystery in the today s elementary particle physics .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses may be related to whether the neutrinos are dirac or majorana fermions .",
    "the fact that the neutrino mixing can be approximated by the tri - bi - maximal mixing  @xcite may suggest some underlying structure such as flavor symmetry  @xcite .    in the standard model ( sm ) , neutrinos are assumed to be massless due to the absence of right - handed neutrinos . in order to explain the tiny neutrino masses ,",
    "many mass generation mechanisms have been proposed in the literature  @xcite . upon introducing right - handed neutrinos",
    ", one can have dirac mass terms for neutrinos .",
    "however , neutrinos have unnaturally small masses as compared to the other sm fermions .",
    "therefore , one may expect that neutrinos are in fact majorana particles and that their masses are generated from a different origin  @xcite than the other sm fermions .",
    "there are three possibilities to generate the majorana mass for neutrinos if one is allowed to introduce only one type of new particles at a time .",
    "they are generally dubbed type - i , -ii , and -iii seesaw mechanisms in which the sm is added with @xmath6 singlet fermions  @xcite , triplet scalar bosons  @xcite , and triplet fermions  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the majorana mass term thus generated involves a dimension-5 operator and is thus suppressed by some dimensionful parameter in the model .",
    "the type - ii seesaw mechanism is often called the higgs triplet model ( htm ) , where the neutrino masses are generated by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of a complex higgs triplet field  @xcite . an important feature of the htm is that the neutrino mass matrix is directly related to the yukawa coupling matrix of the higgs triplet field .",
    "another characteristic feature of the model is the existence of a doubly charged higgs boson . in a good portion of the triplet vev range",
    ", the particle decays dominantly into a pair of same - sign leptons , leading to distinctive signatures at hadron colliders .",
    "moreover , such leptonic decays may involve flavor violation and have different branching ratio patterns , depending on the triplet vev , majorana phases , and the neutrino mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus , a detailed study of the leptonic decays of the doubly charged higgs boson may provide useful information on the neutrino mass matrix  @xcite , giving us a possibility to reveal the nature of neutrinos through collider studies  @xcite .",
    "the doubly charged higgs boson has been searched for at the tevatron  @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite . in the experimental analyses",
    ", it is generally assumed that the doubly charged higgs boson dominantly decays into same - sign lepton pairs with the same or different flavors .",
    "lower mass bounds are then set by further assuming specific leptonic decay patterns .",
    "besides such a scenario , we find no other mass bound available from hadron colliders otherwise .",
    "the precision measurements of the @xmath7 boson decay width at the lep have constrained the doubly charged higgs boson mass to be above @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "colliders , the doubly charged higgs boson with a mass more than @xmath8 can be probed by looking for the same - sign dilepton signal via @xmath9 where one of the doubly charged higgs boson may be off mass shell . ]    in this paper , we study the scenario where the triplet vev is sufficiently large so that the doubly charged higgs bosons decay dominantly into a pair of weak gauge bosons instead .",
    "even though one still looks for same - sign leptons from the @xmath10 boson decay , this case is more involved because of the missing energy in the final state and suffers from larger sm backgrounds .",
    "we perform a detailed simulation for both the htm and the model proposed by georgi and machacek  @xcite .",
    "we here consider the range of the triplet vev between @xmath11 and a few tens of gev which is allowed by experimetal data , and analyze the phenomenology of such a doubly charged higgs boson with a mass of @xmath12 and examine the lhc reach by imposing appropriate cuts .",

    "we divide our analysis of no forward jet tagging into high - mass and low - mass regions and discuss the corresponding cuts . in the high - mass region , we further propose the use of forward jet tagging to improve the significance of the signal .",
    "we show various distributions for the collision energy of 8 tev only , noting that those for 14 tev are qualitatively the same but differ in magnitude .",
    "finally , we show the required luminosity for a 5-sigma discovery of the doubly charged higgs boson for two benchmark triplet vev s .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the doubly charged higgs boson production at the large hadron collider in the higgs triplet model ( htm ) and the georgi - machacek model .",
    "we focus on the scenario in which the decay channel of a pair of weak gauge bosons is dominant for the doubly changed higgs boson due to a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs triplet field .    in this scenario ,",
    "the doubly charged higgs boson is produced via the pair production processes @xmath157 and @xmath158 , the vbf process @xmath159 , and the associated production process @xmath160 .",
    "we take two benchmark values for the triplet vev , @xmath57 : 1 gev and 55 gev .",
    "the former corresponds to the limit when the pair production processes are dominant , whereas the latter is the upper limit of the triplet vev for @xmath161 in the georgi - machacek model .",
    "the pair production rates are independent of the triplet vev , @xmath57 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross sections of the vbf and the associated production are proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "the vbf production becomes dominant for a heavy doubly charged higgs boson ( @xmath162 gev ) when @xmath57 is sufficiently large .",
    "taking @xmath124 gev , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : xsec ] the cross sections of various doubly charged higgs boson production processes for the lhc operating at 8 tev and 14 tev . we have performed a detailed simulation of the signals and the backgrounds at the lhc . only the distributions for the 8 tev collisions are presented because the 14 tev case has virtually the same distribution shapes , differing only in magnitude . in our scenario ,",
    "the doubly charged higgs boson decays into a pair of same - sign @xmath10 bosons , each of which further decays into lepton pairs , resulting in a pair of same - sign dileptons as the signature of lepton number violation .",
    "the @xmath10 bosons can be off - shell , depending on the doubly charged higgs boson mass .",
    "we have carried out the analysis without forward jet tagging in both high - mass and low - mass regions separately and discussed the corresponding cuts .",
    "we have also performed the analysis with forward jet tagging to improve significance in the high - mass region where the vbf production mechanism becomes dominant .",
    "the significance in these analyses is summarized in tables  [ tab : nojetlow ] , [ tab : nojethigh ] and [ tab : jettag ] , assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath2 fb@xmath133 .",
    "we find that the analysis with forward jet tagging is most effective for @xmath131 gev and @xmath153 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis without jet tagging is effective for @xmath154 gev since the cross sections of pair production processes are large in this region .",
