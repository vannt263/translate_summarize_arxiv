    " self - assembly \" of atomic , molecular and supramolecular systems is a topic that has been receiving a great deal of attention of late . roughly speaking , it is the phenomenon of system components arranging themselves via their mutual interaction to form a larger functional unit .",
    "examples are plentiful ; in biology , they include but are not limited to the spontaneous formation of the dna double helix from two complementary oligonucleotide chains , the formation of lipid bilayers as membranes , and spontaneous protein folding into the native , functional state . on the other hand , self - assembly can be employed in the synthesis of nanostructures as an alternative to nanolithography .",
    "for example , whitesides @xcite has demonstrated that complex two - dimensional structure can emerge in organic molecules placed on an inorganic surface .",
    "this is a natural system for studying self - assembly in two dimensions .",
    "jenekhe and chen @xcite showed self - assembly of block copolymers into ordered arrays for possible use as photonic bandgap materials .",
    "block copolymers are indeed natural candidates for use in photonic devices due to the elaborate structures they can form and their multiple dielectric constants .",
    "stellacci et .",
    "al . @xcite have shown how gold nanowires can be assembled by functionalizing nanoparticles with organic molecules .",
    "manoharan et .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated extremely robust self - assembly of unique , small clusters of microspheres that can themselves be used for self - assembly of more complex architectures .",
    "this is an emerging field with a wealth of experimental data that does not yet have a predictive theoretical basis .",
    "where there has been theoretical work , it has focused on explaining the self - assembly in systems with given interparticle interactions @xcite or of known macromolecular structure @xcite .",
    "these studies solve the `` forward '' problem of statistical mechanics , i.e. they take the interaction as known and solve for the structure and equilibrium properties of the system . in this study",
    ", we take the inverse appraoch - given a desired many - particle configuration of the system , we search for the optimal interaction among component particles which spontaneously produces that target structure .",
    "our goal is to introduce an _ inverse statistical - mechanical _",
    "methodology for optimizing adjustable interactions for targeted self - assembly .",
    "motivation for this comes from the plethora of recent examples wherein materials have been designed to possess predetermined properties .",
    "examples of these include novel crystal structures for photonic band - gap applications @xcite , materials with negative or vanishing thermal expansion coefficients @xcite , materials with negative poisson ratios @xcite , materials with optimal transport and mechanical properties @xcite , mesoporous solids for applications in catalysis , separations , sensors and electronics @xcite , and systems characterized by entropically driven inverse freezing @xcite .",
    "our goal is to devise methods that can be applied to any predetermined target structure , be they amorphous or even quasicrystalline , thus extending the traditional meaning of self - assembly beyond that of periodic structures .",
    "we choose colloidal systems @xcite as models for studying self - assembly .",
    "colloids are ideally suited for this purpose because interparticle interactions are tunable .",
    "the colloid interparticle potential , @xmath0 , can contain a hard - core term , a charge dispersion ( van der waals ) term , a dipole - dipole term ( isotropic in 2d ) , a screened - coulombic ( yukawa ) term , and a short - ranged attractive depletion term .",
    "all of these have adjustable amplitudes , and in the case of the yukawa term , the screening length can be adjusted by changing the salt concentration in solution . taken together ,",
    "these interactions form a large set of functional forms for the interaction potential .",
    "although we do not limit ourselves in this study to these interactions , we bear in mind the limits of complexity that these interactions will allow and we try not to exceed these bounds in searching for our optimized potentials .",
    "the adjustable colloidal interactions discussed in the previous paragraph are by nature isotropic .",
    "thus , in this study , we consider only potentials that have this property .",
    "even for this relatively simple class of potentials it is nt at all clear what are the limitations for self - assembly .",
    "for example , chiral structures with specified handedness can not be distinguished energetically from their mirror - image counterpart .",
    "what other structures can not be valid target structures ?",
    "a central question in colloidal and photonics research is regarding whether a diamond lattice ( in three dimensions ) can be self - assembled , since such a lattice of dielectric spheres has a large photonic bandgap and would therefore be a viable material for future photonic devices .",
    "it is not known whether a diamond lattice can be assembled using isotropic colloidal particles ; indeed , the bonding in diamond itself is highly directional .",
    "there has been recent interest in self - assembly of anisotropic particles .",
    "examples of these are the so - called ` patchy particles'@xcite and the unique colloidal clusters of manoharan et .",
    "al . discussed above , which are are anisotropic simply by virtue of their non - spherical shapes .",
    "although our algorithms can be easily generalized to non - isotropic interactions , we restrict ourselves to studying self - assembly with isotropic potentials since this per se is a complex and subtle problem , and a very non - trivial test bed for our optimization schemes .",
    "also , isotropic colloids are easy to produce by comparison and their potential forms are manipulated relatively easily .",
    "a general potential energy function for a system of classically interacting particles at positions @xmath1 in zero external field can be written as @xmath2 where the @xmath3 s are @xmath4-body potentials .",
    "since we only consider systems with isotropic interactions , we write @xmath5    two necessary conditions for this to be useful in the present context are :    * the target lattice is energetically favored among a host of other lattices over a significant specific area ( denoted @xmath6 henceforth ) range ( stable lattice sums ) . * that it have real phonon frequencies at every wavevector in the brillouin zone ( stable phonons ) .",
    "past work on lattice self - assembly has not used both energy and mechanical stability criteria in tandem as we do here ; we consider this to be a main strength of our approach .",
    "still , these conditions are not universally sufficient for any pair interaction and lattice structure .",
    "however , taken together , these necessary conditions constitute a prescription for finding pair potentials that most robustly stabilize a given target lattice . in the first optimization scheme (",
    "both are described further on ) , a pair potential is found that maximizes the energy gap between the target lattices and its competitors , while keeping all phonon frequencies real .",
    "the second scheme assumes stable lattice sums and real phonon frequencies , and uses md simulations to maximize the stability of the lattice near its melting point .    for the purposes of this study , we will say that a lattice is self - assembled if it is formed from a random configuration in a well equilibrated , annealed nvt mc simulation .",
    "it should be emphasized that the requirement that a given lattice self - assemble in a mc simulation is a very strong one . in conventional theoretical studies of colloidal crystallization @xcite ,",
    "a number of candidate lattices are chosen and a phase diagram is drawn by comparing free energies of the lattices to each other and the liquid state over a range of thermodynamic parameters . however",
    ", this procedure says nothing of mechanical stability , or whether crystallization of the lattice is preempted by that of another structure not considered .",
    "these shortcomings are removed when self - assembly in an mc , from a random initial configuration , is required .",
    "that said , finite - size effects and limited cpu time in an mc simulation might prevent self - assembly of a structure that should form .    in the present paper",
    "we specialize to target structures that are two - dimensional . in particular we seek optimal potentials for self - assembly of the square lattice and honeycomb lattices , the latter being the two - dimensional analog of the diamond lattice ( four maximally separated neighbors in 3d versus three maximally separated neighbors in 2d ) .",
    "this would be the first demonstration of which we are aware of a lattice as sparse as the honeycomb being self - assembled in an annealed monte carlo simulation .",
    "this work is an expansion on a previous introductory note by the present authors @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "a new optimization algorithm is introduced and applied .",
    "besides the honeycomb lattice considered in the previous work , the triangular ( as a control ) and square lattices are studied .",
    "we make the case for a more stringent requirement for self - assembly and show that some previous claims of lattice self - assembly in linear - ramp potentials are flawed , which is also new to this paper . a more extensive discussion of the problem of self - assembly in systems with isotropic interactions is given in the conclusion section , including some novel monte carlo results for colloidal clusters and colloidal chains . in a future paper , we will apply these inverse methods to three - dimensional colloidal systems . while it is certainly true",
    "that many - body behavior is fundamentally different in 3d , our methods are easily generalizable to higher dimensions , and we believe they will be as effective .    in the following section , we discuss past work on this topic both for the sake of motivation and to show work upon which we have attempted to improve .",
    "this is followed by a section describing our optimization schemes .",
    "next are sections on the triangular , square and honeycomb lattices , with potentials for their self - assembly and details of their applications .",
    "we discuss the triangular lattice here as a control case , and to give the details of our simulation procedure .",
    "the final section is the discussion of our results and some conclusions based on them .",
    "weber and stillinger @xcite examined self - assembly of a square lattice for a particular potential that included two and three body interactions .",
    "they found that for their potential , the square lattice was indeed the ground state and demonstrated that it self - assembled in a 2500 particle molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "our work is motivated by this , but is different in two key ways .",
    "the first is that we restrict ourselves to a much smaller class of potential functions , namely those that are two body only and isotropic .",
    "this should make our potentials lend themselves better to realization in the lab .",
    "the second is that we are searching systematically for functional forms for @xmath0 that stabilize open structures , whereas in @xcite , the authors postulated a potential that seemed like it should favor the square lattice and studied its properties .",
    "weber and stillinger took the direct approach , we take the inverse approach .    the so - called ` reverse ' monte carlo method @xcite of lyubartsev et .",
    "al . was devised to find interparticle potentials that produced given liquid state pair correlation functions .",
    "a similar method was developed by muller - plathe@xcite using simplex optimization . although these are inverse techniques , they are fundamentally different from our methods here for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that the pair correlation function contains limited information about an n - particle configuration .",
    "our method produces assembly of a given configuration .",
    "the second reason is that these techniques fundamentally deal with liquids and so do not apply to self - assembly as it is commonly defined .",
    "e. a. jagla claims in @xcite to have found an isotropic pair potential form that stabilizes a number of structures ( including the honeycomb lattice ) called the ` linear - ramp ' potential , which consists of a hard - core at @xmath7 plus a linear tail going to zero at a distance @xmath8 .",
    "a phase diagram is drawn in that paper indicating the stability of the structures he lists for different pressures and values of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the structures which he gives as stable at a number of points in his phase diagram do not meet both of the necessary conditions for self - assembly that we describe above , and they do not self - assemble in annealed mc simulations . as a demonstration of this , we choose @xmath10 , which the phase diagram indicates should yield the square lattice for certain pressure values . for this value of @xmath9",
    "we find the range in specific area , @xmath6 , for which the square beats out the other three lattices ( see fig . [",
    "fig : jagla_ls ] ) , and find the phonon spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla_pho ] ) over that range .",
    "phonon spectra were calculated in the standard way by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix for a very fine grid of k - points in the brillouin zone ( a detailed explanation of this is given in @xcite ) .",
    "any lattice at a given specific area / volume that has an imaginary phonon frequency at any wavevector is necessarily mechanically unstable .",
    "an nvt mc simulation of 625 particles annealed from @xmath11 to @xmath12 is shown at @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla_mc ] .",
    "although there are pockets of square lattice present , it is clear that the lattice has not assembled , and there is no long range order .",
    "this can be seen from the plot of the structure factor , @xmath14 , given in fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla_sf ] .",
    "one of two things has happened here .",
    "either the system has become a glass , or it has no freezing transition .",
    "this shows that comparing the energies of a number of lattices ( as suggested in @xcite ) can not alone give certainty of the ground state .",

    "s(k ) for configuration in figure [ fig : jagla_mc].,width=249,height=249 ]",
    "a central feature of our approach to the inverse problem is the design of computational algorithms that search for and optimize a functional form for @xmath0 that leads to self - assembly of a given target structure .",
    "the direct ( non - inverse ) version of this is the problem of the first order freezing transition , and has been studied analytically and numerically using , for example , classical density functional methods @xcite .    optimizing a pair potential , @xmath0 , for self - assembly means choosing a family of functions @xmath19 , parameterized by the @xmath20 s , and then finding the values of the parameters that lead to the most robust and defect - free self - assembly of the target lattice , at a given specific volume @xmath6 ( or specific area in 2d )",
    ". we must be careful to choose the parameters such that an overall rescaling of the potential is not possible , and we keep each parameter within a prespecified range , @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the choice of parameterization and initial parameter values is important : we make educated guesses based on the coordination numbers of lattices close in structure to the target lattice .",
    "optimization can be carried out either at zero temperature or near melting .",
    "+      once the parameterization and initial parameters are chosen , we perform a simulated annealing optimization to maximize the difference in lattice energy per particle , @xmath22 , between the target lattice and its closest energetic competitor among the principle lattices in the system dimension ( e.g. in 2d , among triangular , square , honeycomb and kagom ) .",
    "this procedure is called the ` zero - temperature ' scheme because it seeks to minimize the difference in lattice potential energies , rather than free energies ; it is a search for stable ground states .",
    "formally , if @xmath23 is the energy per particle at specific volume @xmath6 , we take as our objective function @xmath24 } \\epsilon^{t}(\\alpha)- \\min_{\\alpha \\in [ \\alpha_{min } , \\alpha_{max } ] } \\epsilon^{j}(\\alpha)].\\ ] ]    here , @xmath25 refers to the target lattice , @xmath26 enumerates the competitor lattices and @xmath27 $ ] is a specific volume range , within which the target @xmath6 lies .",
    "the simulated annealing is performed in @xmath20 parameter space , searching for a potential that minimizes @xmath28 .",
    "this alone is not sufficient ; we must also guarantee the mechanical stability of the lattice .",
    "this is done by making sure that at the target @xmath6 , the given potential is such that every phonon mode in the brillouin zone is real . in practise , this is done by constraining the lowest eigenvalue of the dynamical matrix ( frequency squared ) to be positive , and the lowest curvature eigenvalue of the softest acoustic phonon mode to be greater than some positive cutoff value . while this does not necessarily imply that all frequencies will be real , it is usually sufficient , and in any case the frequency of every mode can be calculated post facto .    in this scheme , we make the assumption that the greater the difference in lattice energy per particle , @xmath22 , ( over a range of @xmath6 s around the target @xmath6 ) of the target lattice and its principle competitors , the greater will be the target s tendency to assemble .",
    "while this is not by any means a rigorous statement , it seems to make intuitive sense - the greater the energy difference , the less the tendency to get frustrated at the freezing point between two lattices ; the annealing should find the deeper energy minimum .",
    "it is possible that another structure will preempt the target lattice ( freeze at a higher temperature ) , even if the optimization proceeds perfectly .",
    "the mc will then get ` stuck ' ; the simulation will never go to its ground state because it is caught in a strongly metastable state .",
    "presumeably , however , a colloidal system with the same interaction potential would undergo a structural phase transition to the its ground state as the temperature was lowered .",
    "our mc simulations did indeed get stuck in slightly defected configurations very close to the desired lattice . to check that these structures were nt inherently more stable than the target",
    ", we always confirmed that the defects caused the system to have higher energy than that of the lattice .",
    "the main disadvantage of this optimization procedure is that it is very specific to simple lattices , and is not naturally generalized to more complicated structures .",
    "indeed , the cpu time required for the optimization grows as the cube of the number of basis elements in the lattice , so optimizing for complex structures quickly becomes intractable .",
    "nonperiodic structures ( e.g. quasicrystals ) are thus impossible for this scheme .",
    "this optimization scheme is competitor - based ; we favor the target by energetically disfavoring other lattices .",
    "however , this does not preclude other structures , periodic or otherwise from being lower in energy than the target .",
    "this is an inherent limitation of this technique .",
    "the next scheme , however , does not suffer this shortcoming .      in this procedure",
    ", we first make sure that the initial potential satisfies our two stated necessary conditions for self - assembly with the initial parameter values , namely that the target lattice is energetically favored over the others over a wide @xmath6-range , and that at our chosen @xmath6 , all phonon modes are real .",
    "we then feed this family of functions to the algorithm , and optimize it for self - assembly at a temperature near ( but below ) the lattice s melting point by suppressing nucleation of the liquid phase in md simulations .",
    "we first find the melting temperature of the system by running an nve ( canonical ensemble ) molecular dynamics simulation ( md ) on a system of particles , in the target configuration , at incrementally increasing temperatures ( mean square velocity ) .",
    "we then run the md repeatedly at 80 - 95% of the melting temperature ( the temperature is chosen such that phase - transition fluctuations do not render the calculations inconsistent ) , each time calculating the lindemann parameter , defined by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the position of the @xmath31 particle after an appropriate amount of simulation time , @xmath32 is its initial position , and @xmath33 is the number of particles .",
    "@xmath34 is then taken as the objective function for a simulated annealing calculation , and those parameters , @xmath20 , are found such that @xmath34 is minimized .",
    "it should be noted that in order to get a reproducible value of @xmath34 , it must be averaged over a number of md runs .",
    "we choose to minimize the lindemann parameter because it gives some quantitative measure of the degree of liquid nucleation or structural phase transition setting in near the melting point .",
    "presumeably , the more these effects are suppressed , the more robustly the potential favors the given target structure . the algorithm will by its nature disfavor potentials that violate either of our two necessary conditions for self - assembly .",
    "it is inevitable that over the course of the optimization the melting temperature of the potential will be changed ; it could be that at that point , the system will no longer be near the phase coexistence regime .",
    "this can be detected easily enough ( for example by comparing the lindemann parameter to that which the harmonic approximation predicts ) , and then the optimization can be stopped and restarted at a higher , appropriately chosen temperature .",
    "an important limitation of this optimization is in the tradeoff between its consistency and its closeness in temperature to the melting point . due to large fluctuations near melting , getting reproducible values for @xmath34 with sufficiently small error requires larger and larger system sizes .",
    "so while the optimization can be carried out well into the anharmonic regime , the optimization can not sample true phase coexistence , only nucleation .",
    "the inherent bias in this scheme towards the target lattice presents a problem for optimization .",
    "the procedure does not distinguish between a configuration being in a thermodynamically stable state at the given temperature and being in a supercooled metastable state .",
    "just as in a mc simulation , the md may get ` stuck ' . as a result ,",
    "the target may become strongly metastable but never thermodynamically favored .",
    "the only way to decrease this effect is to get closer in temperature to the melting point , but this in turn requires more and more cpu time .    besides the obvious advantage that this scheme incorporates finite - temperature , anharmonic effects",
    ", it has the advantage of being competitor - free . whereas in the @xmath35 scheme",
    ", competitor lattices have to be chosen against which the target lattice competes , this procedure ostensibly optimizes against _ all _ competition .",
    "it should be noted that if an initial potential with favorable lattice sums and stable phonons for this procedure can not be found by trial - and - error , the zero - temperature scheme can be run first on a given functional parameterization .",
    "this procedure would then take that output as its input .",
    "this is perhaps the best way to combine the two optimizations .",
    "a very well studied interparticle potential that robustly stabilizes the triangular lattice is the lj@xcite , given in a form rescaled from its traditional definition , @xmath36 we discuss this potential here as a control .",
    "we have employed it in a 500 particle nvt ensemble , annealing it down from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( allowing sufficient equilibration time at each temperature step ) , with average specific area given by the triangular lattice area when the nearest neighbor is at unity , namely @xmath39 .",
    "lattice sums , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri_lat ] , demonstrate that energetically , the triangular does beat the square , honeycomb , and kagom lattices over a wide range of @xmath6 s ( actually globally in this case ) .",
    "[ fig : tri_pho ] shows that all phonon frequencies are indeed real .",
    "the two branches of course represent the longitudal and transverse acoustic modes of oscillation .",
    "clearly the lj potential meets our two necessary conditions , that it be energetically favored over the other lattices and that it have real phonon frequencies .",
    "[ fig : tri_mc ] shows that it does indeed self - assemble into the triangular lattice .",
    "the structure factor , @xmath14 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri_sf ] shows conclusively the existence of long - range order here . for a different target lattice",
    ", we would have defined a family of potentials of which the lj was one , run the optimization program , and then performed the mc self - assembly calculation .",
    "we do not run the optimization for the lj here because it is a relatively simple potential , and we wish to use it simply as a reference .",
    "note that for all mc simulations in this study we use an nvt ensemble with periodic boundary conditions , adjusting the mc maximum step fraction such that 30% acceptance is maintained throughout the simulation ( for maximal ergodicity)@xcite , and anneal through the freezing transition towards @xmath35 .",
    "s(k ) for the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri_mc].,width=249,height=249 ]",
    "finding a stabilizing potential for the square lattice is in some sense a more straightforward task than for the honeycomb lattice since the neighbor distances are different from those of the triangular .",
    "quandt and teter accidentally came across a pair interaction that stabilized the square lattice when examining quasiperiodic structures in 2d systems @xcite .",
    "qualitatively very similar to the optimal @xmath0 that we derive below , their square lattice potential satisfies our necessary conditions , as expected .",
    "their potential gives a very soft phonon branch , causing the crystal to be very sensitive to perturbations - the potential we derive below improves on this .",
    "here we use the square lattice as a simple illustration and a test case of our methods . in finding an initial potential , we choose to start with the lj potential .",
    "consider an @xmath6 for which the nearest neighbor distance is unity ( for the square lattice , this is itself unity , i.e. @xmath15 ) , then for the triangular lattice , the next nearest neighbor is at @xmath40 and for the square lattice it is at @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we desire to find a potential that is positive at @xmath40 but negative at @xmath41 .",
    "consider a lj potential with an added gaussian centered at @xmath42 which has a low enough width so that @xmath43 is negative , and has a great enough amplitude so that @xmath44 is positive . this would do the job of favoring the square lattice second neighbor while excluding the triangular lattice one .",
    "still , the amplitude and width must be chosen such that our necessary stability conditions are met .",
    "the trade - off here is clear : with an amplitude too low , the square lattice will not be energetically favored , and with an amplitude too high , the lattice will not be mechanically stable ( the phonon frequencies will not be everywhere real ) .",

    "the zero temperature scheme produced the potential @xmath69 - 0.4\\exp[-40(r-1.755)^2].\\label{hon - pot-1}\\ ] ]    similarly to the square lattice , the zero - temperature scheme produced a honeycomb structure with long - range order , albeit with more defects ( 11 vacancies and 2 interstitials , compared to 3 vacancies and 0 interstitials for the function given in ( [ hon - pot-2 ] ) ) .",

    "in sum , we have introduced and demonstrated two optimization schemes for lattice self - assembly in two dimensions , each producing optimized pair potentials for the square and honeycomb lattices .",
    "the schemes are directly generalizable to three dimensions and to more complicated structures .",
    "future work will do exactly this , testing whether schemes that work well for single component systems in two dimensions have wider applicability .",
    "although we have found potentials that have as their ground states the honeycomb and square lattices at particular @xmath6 s , these functional forms for @xmath0 are by no means unique . in future work , we will try to optimize for ` robustness ' in self - assembly .",
    "in particular , we would like to find potentials that not only cause self - assembly of a system of particles into a desired target structure , but that make the structure minimally sensitive to perturbations in density , pressure , and chemical potential , as well as to small changes in functional form of @xmath0 .",
    "this is extremely important if these potentials are to be implemented experimentally for two reasons .",
    "the first is that there is of course some experimental error in tuning the parameters in the potential , and these small uncertainties should not prevent self - assembly .",
    "the second is that we may wish to use experimental interactions to approximate optimal solutions with different parameterizations , and there will be some error associated with this fit .",
    "the potentials for the square and honeycomb lattices found in this work can indeed be called robust . for the square lattice potential",
    ", there is a wide range of parameter values around our optimal solutions that yield favorable lattice sums , real phonon frequencies , and produce near defect - free self - assembly .",
    "the important features of this potential are a strong initial repulsion ( representing a near hard - core interaction ) , an attractive well at distance @xmath73 as well as a positive maximum ( we used a gaussian ) at or around @xmath74 .",
    "not any functional form with these features will necessarily work ; but we have found that perturbations around the potentials given above ( relations [ squ - pot-2 ] and [ squ - pot-1 ] ) that preserve these features do indeed cause square lattice self - assembly .",
    "the same can be said of the potentials derived for the honeycomb lattice ( relations [ hon - pot-2 ] and [ hon - pot-1 ] ) , except of course with different features .",
    "these features are the strong initial repulsion , the positivity of the first minimum and the negativity of a second minimum , where the minima are at distance ratio @xmath75 .",
    "the chosen @xmath6 puts the first minimum at , or near , the honeycomb nearest neighbor .",
    "it is a natural question to ask whether available colloidal interactions can be made to fit our optimized @xmath0 s .",
    "although obviously they can not match these functions exactly , they can indeed form a good approximation .",
    "for example , our optimized honeycomb potential has a strong initial repulsion , followed by a short attraction , a steep repulsion and then another attraction . by adjusting relative amplitudes",
    ", this functional form can be approximated by a hard - core , a dispersion interaction , a repulsive dipole - dipole interaction and an attractive depletion .",
    "there is indeed hope for using realizable interactions to form open structures in 2d colloidal systems .",
    "extensive attempts were made to find a potential that stabilizes the kagom lattice but none were thoroughly successful .",
    "a potential was found that satisfied the necessary conditions , and the optimization was run .",
    "although the mc run gave a lattice with long - range order , the interstitials were somewhat randomly placed .",
    "this is because there exists another 2d lattice with 4 coordination ( as the kagom has)@xcite , and it and the kagom are nearly indistinguishible in energy for almost any lj - based potential we used . because of this closeness in energy , the interstitial sites themselves formed a weakly interacting lattice gas .",
    "the problem of kagom lattice self - assembly goes beyond the competition with one other lattice , however .",
    "the kagom has the property that it is in many ways an intermediate between the triangular and honeycomb lattices : its density is in between the two ; the first three coordination numbers are ( 4,6,4 ) as opposed to ( 6,6,6 ) in the triangular and ( 3,6,3 ) in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "so if the potential is significant for only the first three neighbors ( as ours have been ) then , rigorously , the kagom can not energetically beat the honeycomb and triangular lattices over all densities .",
    "furthermore , there is an extremely delicate energetic balance between a stable kagom and a phase separation into the triangular and honeycomb lattices .",
    "we believe that for these reasons our optimizations have been unable to cause self - assembly of the kagom .",
    "the defects that were observed in the self - assembled triangular and honeycomb lattice do not disturb the crystal structure ; this is to say that particles could be simply inserted at the defect points and a perfect lattice would emerge .",
    "there are two possible reasons for the defects : first , that to have some number of them is energetically favorable , and thus the ground state configuration is not the perfect lattice ; second , that the slow dynamics of the mc simulation at low temperatures prevent the defects from being removed in a realistic amount of cpu time .",
    "a look at the energetics shows that the second explanation is the right one . over a small range of @xmath6 around the simulation density , the perfect lattice has lower energy than that of the structure obtained in the simulation .",
    "perhaps simulations in the @xmath76vt ensemble ( grand canonical ) would allow for more general phase space sampling and thus demonstrate that the gaps are spontaneously filled .",
    "if it is possible to stabilize structures that were once thought to require directional bonding , what else can be stabilized ?",
    "block copolymers ? for the purpose of seeing how far isotropic potentials can be taken , we examined what we call the ` five - finger potential ' , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5-finger ] .",
    "we chose this form for the potential since it would inhibit second nearest neighbors of any lattice to form , only allowing long chains of particles .",
    "annealed mc results for this are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5-finger - mc ] . as shown",
    ", this potential allows for the assembly of such parallel chains at @xmath77 .",
    "this potential can not be built in the lab with current technology ",
    "it is far too complex , but it shows that isotropic potentials have perhaps more flexibility than one would immediately think .",
    "it is also possible that a much simpler potential could allow for a similar structure to assemble .",
    "we have also devised a circularly symmetric potential function that favors the assembly of small clusters of particles .",
    "the form of the potential was chosen to inhibit the formation of clusters with second and third ( and so on ) nearest - neighbors  the most favorable structure thus being a _ simplex _ , or equilateral - triangle cluster .",
    "the structures we find are similar to those observed experimentally by manoharan et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "although they do not find the functional form of the potential explicitly , they conclude that the clusters that they observe can not be a result only of van der waals attraction and the hard core repulsion of the polystyrene colloid particles used in their experiment .",
    "this potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simplex ] , which we run at specific area @xmath78 .",
    "mc results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simplex - mc ] .",
    "one can imagine carrying on the process of qualitatively searching for isotropic potentials for more and more complex structures ad infinitum , with arbitrarily complex structures requiring more and more elaborate functional forms .",
    "for example , one might try to assemble a buckyball with a spherically symmetric pair potential by running an nvt annealing simulation with 60 particles interacting via a potential that has sharp minima at every interparticle distance for that molecule .",
    "there must be a limit , however  although it is conceivable that a chiral structure would self - assemble , we can not choose its chirality if we employ only an isotropic potential ( left and right handed structures are equally likely ) . a key question that we ask , and that this study answers only in part , is whether we can make qualitative statements about the types of structures that can be assembled using only isotropic pair interactions .",
    "we are currently working on expanding this work to three dimensional systems .",
    "moreover , we are exploring the possibility of tailoring for self - assembly thermodynamic quantities besides the area or volume , such as the pressure ( in an npt ensemble simulation ) and the chemical potential ( in a @xmath76vt ensemble simulation ) . in future work",
    ", we plan to explore the self - assembly properties of multicompontent media using our inverse / optimization approach ."
