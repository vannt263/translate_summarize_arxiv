    "topological superconductors have recently attracted enormous theoretical and experimental interest  @xcite because they can host certain exotic defects ( e.g. vortices ) that bind majorana zero - energy modes .",
    "this excitement stems from the fact that such defects obey non - abelian braiding statistics  @xcite , and can be utilized for topological quantum computing  @xcite . among the many proposed realizations of topological superconductivity  @xcite , a particularly promising one involves a quasi - one - dimensional semiconductor covered by an s - wave superconductor  @xcite .",
    "such a system effectively realizes the so - called majorana quantum wire  @xcite with majorana zero - energy modes appearing at the opposite ends of the wire .",

    "@xcite using tunneling transport measurements .",
    "the appearance of a zero bias conduction peak characteristic for majorana zero - energy modes ( majoranas ) was observed at a finite magnetic field in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "this observation has excited the physics community since majoranas can be manipulated in network structures of quasi-1d wires  @xcite , which opens up the possibility for topological quantum computing  @xcite .    inspired by this recent experimental progress  @xcite , we consider here a topological superconductor ( tsc)-quantum dot ( qd)-normal lead ( nl ) junction . such structures might naturally form in the semiconductor nanowire experiments  @xcite or can be purposely engineered using other potential experimental realizations of majoranas ( _ e.g. _ , the domain walls on the edge of 2d topological insulator  @xcite ) in order to control and manipulate majoranas  @xcite .",
    "we consider here the regime where the dot is occupied by a single electon , such that , in the absence of the majorana coupling , the system flows to the celebrated kondo fixed point  @xcite , which has been of paramount importance to condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "it appears in many mesoscopic systems where an effective impurity spin is coupled to a wide range of contact materials  @xcite . in this setup , where majorana and kondo interactions compete at low energies , it is thus a natural and fundamental question to ask what the resulting physics is .",
    "furthermore , previous work in refs .",
    "has shown that the competition between the superconducting proximity effect and kondo correlations leads to the emergence of zero - bias conduction peaks at certain values of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in interpreting the results of experiments on tsc - qd - nl systems , it is important to understand and distinguish the origin of zero - bias peaks .",
    "transport properties of tsc - qd - nl nanostructures have been investigated theoretically in refs .  .",
    "the authors of ref .   investigated transport properties of a tsc - qd - nl junction in the high - temperature limit using perturbative ( in the normal - metal coupling ) master equations .",
    "however , in order to understand the low - temperature properties of the tsc - qd - nl system , one needs to take into account dot - lead tunneling non - perturbatively .",
    "this aspect of the problem has been investigated by golub _",
    "_  , who concluded that kondo correlations have a decisive effect on the transport properties .",
    "they obtain a strong temperature dependence of the zero - bias conductance which is different from a normal metal - mbs system  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a related numerical work  @xcite considering a quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and to one end of a tsc concluded that the mbs significantly modifies the low - energy transport properties of the system in the limit of small majorana hybridization energy .",
    "the fact that two previous publications  @xcite reached opposite conclusions , indicates that low energy properties of tsc - qd - nl nanostructure are not yet fully understood .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this problem and investigate the fate of the kondo fixed point in a tsc - qd - nl nanostructure using both analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "we show that in a wide range of physical parameters , the majorana - induced coupling is the leading relevant perturbation and drives the system to a new infrared fixed point , i.e. the kondo fixed point becomes unstable in the presence of majorana - induced couplings .",
    "thus , our conclusions regarding this issue are the opposite from those of ref .",
    ", as discussed in more detail below .",
    "we also show that transport properties of the qd - based junctions involving topological and non - topological superconductors are very different .",
    "given that quantum dots constitute relatively simple model systems with high tunability , we suggest using them as a diagnostic tool for detecting the presence or absence of localized majorana - zero modes .",
    "we consider a nanostructure consisting of a qd with a single spin - degenerate level coupled to a majorana mode in a topological superconductor and an su(2)-invariant normal lead ( tsc - qd - nl junction ) .",

    "one can see that the functional dependence @xmath242 is different from the lorentzian form characteristic to the simpler tpsc - nl structures and has a much richer structure . at zero splitting @xmath222 ,",
    "the conductance is still quantized at zero bias @xmath151 but the broadening of the resonance is a non - trivial function of various parameters : @xmath243[((ev)^2-\\lambda^2 b^2)^2+(ev)^2\\gamma^2 b^4]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath197 in majorana- and kondo - dominated regimes is @xmath244 and @xmath245 , respectively . at small bias @xmath246 , one can estimate the effective width of the resonance @xmath247 to be @xmath248    these results can be understood as follows . in the majorana - dominated regime , the physics of the qd",

    "another interesting feature in the tunneling conductance is the appearance of the sidebands as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond](a ) .",

    "both are experimentally accessible quantities , we show how one can distinguish between kondo and majorana physics in the lab .",

    "this has to be contrasted with the kondo - dominated regime where the impurity spin is disordered for all values of detuning from the particle - hole symmetric point .",
