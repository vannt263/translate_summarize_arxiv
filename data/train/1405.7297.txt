    "since its inception more than half a century ago ,  @xcite the anderson impurity model ( aim )  a single , correlated level coupled to a metallic conduction band  has played a central role in understanding strongly correlated electron systems ,  @xcite with a resurgence of interest in recent years arising from the advent of quantum dot devices .",
    "@xcite its essential physics in the regime where the impurity / dot is in essence singly occupied , is that of the kondo effect : the impurity spin degree of freedom is completely quenched on coupling to the metallic conduction band , and a strong coupling ( sc ) , many - body singlet ground state arises .",
    "yet the metallic aim is atypical in one important sense .",
    "the system is a fermi liquid ( fl ) for _ any _ value of the interaction strength : the model lacks a local ( or boundary ) quantum phase transition ( qpt ) to a phase in which the local spin degree of freedom is incompletely quenched .",
    "local qpts occur of course at @xmath0 , and in the absence of a field that would otherwise destroy them .",
    "the familiar situation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] , with generic interaction strength ( ` @xmath1 ' ) as the abscissa and the qpt occurring at a critical @xmath2 .",
    "the transition separates two distinct phases .",
    "one is perturbatively connected to the non - interacting limit , and in that general sense is thus a fermi liquid .",
    "separated from it by the qpt , the other is not then perturbatively connected to the non - interacting limit . as such , it is a non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) phase .",
    "a zero - field qpt ( @xmath0 ) occurs at a critical interaction @xmath2 .",
    "it separates a fl ( or strong coupling ) phase for @xmath3 , which is adiabatically connected to the non - interacting limit ; from a nfl , local moment phase for @xmath4 .",
    "solid lines denote low - energy scales characteristic of each phase , which vanish as the qpt is approached and set the scale for crossover to quantum critical behavior at finite @xmath5 or field . ]    continuous quantum phase transitions between fl and nfl phases are in fact quite typical in quantum impurity physics . for single - level models ,",
    "examples include the pseudogap aim  @xcite ( where the conduction band density of states has a soft - gap at the fermi level ) , as well as the gapped aim ;  @xcite while many examples arise in multi - level and multi - impurity models , including e.g.  single - channel two - level impurity systems which undergo a qpt to an underscreened spin-1 phase ,  @xcite and impurity models for double  @xcite and triple  @xcite quantum dot devices .",
    "in all these cases the nfl phase is ` common ' in the sense that it occupies a finite fraction of the model parameter space ( i.e.  does not require fine - tuning of parameters to be realized  @xcite ) .",
    "the associated qpts are diverse in character , ranging from a quantum critical point with a fixed point ( fp ) distinct from that characteristic of either the fl or nfl phases , through a critical end - point of a line of fps characteristic of one or other phase ( kosterlitz - thouless transitions ) , to a simple first - order level - crossing transition . and the nfl phases are commonly ( globally ) doubly degenerate states , characterized as such by a degenerate @xmath6 spin - like degree of freedom .",
    "the latter is typically a ` real ' spin , whence we refer to them as local moment ( lm ) phases ; although it can arise also from underlying charge degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite    these degenerate lm phases are the primary focus of the present paper , and are certainly non - trivial  the local spin degree of freedom is not ` free ' , but incompletely quenched by coupling to the conduction band .",
    "part of our motivation arises from the local moment approach ( lma ) ,  @xcite where the notion of local moments enters centrally from the outset , and which provides a rather successful description of the pseudogap ,  @xcite gapped  @xcite and metallic  @xcite aims ; as well as correlated lattice - fermion models  @xcite within the framework of dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite yet the lma is of course approximate ( and in the first instance local moments enter explicitly at mean - field level ) .",
    "our aim here by contrast is to show what can be deduced exactly about lm ( as well as sc ) phases , unfettered by approximations .    for any impurity model",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 refers to the impurity itself , @xmath9 to the conduction band , and the hybridization term @xmath10 couples the impurity and conduction band degrees of freedom . for most of the paper",
    "we consider explicitly the case of a single - level impurity ( and for @xmath0 unless specified otherwise ) .",
