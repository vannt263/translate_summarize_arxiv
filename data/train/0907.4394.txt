    "<S> this system breaks time reversal symmetry , and can be understood as the sc analogue of the quantum hall ( qh ) state . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that the chiral edge state of the chiral sc consists of majorana fermions rather than complex fermions as in the @xmath3 qh state , and thus contains only half the degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> in addition it was shown that a majorana zero mode is trapped in each vortex core @xcite , leading to the non - abelian statistics of vortices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently the time - reversal invariant ( tri ) sc has been proposed @xcite and classified @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such topological sc or superfluid states in two and three dimensions are the analogous to the tri quantum spin hall ( qsh ) or the ti state discovered recently @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , the bogoliubov - de genne ( bdg ) hamiltonian for @xmath4he - b phase is identical to the simplest model hamiltonian of the 3d ti @xcite , giving rise to a single surface state described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the in - plane momentum , @xmath7 is the surface normal , and @xmath8 is the dimensionless spin operator . </S>",
    "<S> despite having the same hamiltonian , the surface state of the @xmath4he - b phase consists of a single majorana cone which has only half the degrees of freedom as the surface state of the ti which consists of a single dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> there has been recent experimental efforts to detect the surface states of @xmath4he - b @xcite . despite results consistent with the existence of the gapless andreev bound state at the surface , these experiments were done on a ` rough ' surface and did not directly detect the majorana cone or the surface state degree of freedom being half that of the usual complex fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we need a probe for a free surface to detect the majorana nature of the surface mode , i.e. an analogue of neutrinoless double beta decay . </S>",
    "<S> there are restrictions on external perturbations which can couple to the majorana surface state of @xmath4he - b ; indeed as they are due to the halving of the degrees of freedom these restrictions are probably the most distinctive features of the surface state . </S>",

    "<S> nonetheless , we find that the majorana nature of the surface mode gives rise to some striking and qualitatively distinct experimental signatures .    </S>",
    "<S> _ surface state of majorana fermion _ : first , we show the basic similarity and difference between the surface modes of @xmath4he - b and the simplest 3d tri ti @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , @xmath15 is formally identical to the simplest model of tri ti with the surface state consisting of a single dirac cone @xcite . in both cases , the momentum - dependence of the off - diagonal term leads to gapless modes bound to the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom for the surface state of the 3d tri system can be understood simply by setting @xmath16 in eq . and reduce the system to a 2d tri system , described by the qsh model of ref . </S>",

    "<S> we have particle and hole excitations rather than conduction and valence band as in the ti . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin - triplet pairing in @xmath4he - b implies equal spin pairing , we can not distinguish the particle and hole excitation through the spin degree of freedom , and thus the annihilation operator of the negative energy state is equivalent to the creation operator of the positive energy state . </S>",
    "<S> this majorana nature of the @xmath4he - b surface mode imposes strong restriction on its interaction with an external perturbation . to see how this restriction comes about </S>",
    "<S> , we need to examine the full mode expansion of fermion creation and annihilation operators near the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we impose the boundary conditions that the surface modes vanish at the surface @xmath24 and decay exponentially in the @xmath4he - b liquid side ( where @xmath25 ) of the surface , albeit much slower than @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> since the wave vector parallel to surface @xmath27 remains a good quantum number , to satisfy these conditions the surface modes needs to be proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . inserting this to the bdg equation eq . </S>",

    "<S> what this means is that the local creation and annihilation operators for a fermion with its spin polarized parallel to the surface is indistinguishable once we ignore modes with eigenenergy greater than @xmath36 , thus reducing the degrees of freedom by half . instead of the usual fermion anticommutation relation , </S>",
    "<S> these majorana operators would form clifford algebra , @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that it is impossible to construct the spin - polarized local density @xmath41 out of the gapless modes if the polarization axis is parallel to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this means that with the gapless surface mode , we can neither construct the local density operator @xmath42 nor the components of the local spin density operator parallel to the surface , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is possible to construct the component of spin density operator perpendicular to the surface , @xmath45 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so in @xmath4he - b the surface state does not contribute to the local density fluctuation while its local spin density is effectively _ ising _ for @xmath46 , which means that the local external perturbation can excite the surface state only if it couples to @xmath47 ; this is a direct consequence of the halving of the degrees of freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to detect the surface state and its majorana nature , it is best to measure dynamic susceptibility arising out of these gapless modes . from the discussion above we see that the dynamic spin susceptibility tensor of the surface state has only single nonzero component : @xmath48 , which we can calculate from eq .. anisotropy this drastic can not be obtained from spin - orbit coupling of the complex fermions such as we see in the ti surface state . </S>",
    "<S> so we conclude that the resonant spin spectroscopy is the best probe for the majorana surface mode . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme anisotropy of the spin susceptibility should be revealed through striking anisotropy in the spin spectroscopy . due to the gapless dispersion </S>",
    "<S> , there will be no @xmath49 suppression of this anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we now need a spin probe that best fits the material property of @xmath4he - b .    </S>",
    "<S> _ esr - spin spectroscopy _ : </S>",
    "<S> we propose electron spin relaxation ( esr ) as the best spin spectroscopy on the @xmath4he - b surface state . </S>",
    "<S> our basic idea is to introduce some extra electrons to @xmath4he - b , apply a weak dc magnetic field ( which satisfies @xmath50 ; note @xmath51 g @xcite ) , excite the electron spins through resonance , and then let these electron spins relax through interaction with the surface state . </S>",
    "<S> this relaxation process would probe the dynamic spin susceptibility of the @xmath4he - b in a way analogous to the way the nuclear magnetic relaxation ( nmr ) is used to probe the dynamic spin susceptibility of electron in a crystalline system . </S>",
    "<S> such probe should reveal the drastic anisotropy of the dynamic spin susceptibility of the surface state due to its majorana nature . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , we start from the spin relaxation rate formula : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the static form factor of the electron ( obtained from fourier transforming the @xmath23 coordinates of the probability density of a single electron ) , @xmath54 is the component of the interaction that flips the electron spin with respect to the direction of the zeeman field , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the @xmath57-coordinates of the @xmath4he atoms and the electron respectively , and @xmath58 is the larmor frequency of the electron </S>",
    "<S> . this formula would look like the standard nmr relaxation formula @xcite if we drop out the @xmath57 dependence , the electron form factor @xmath59 , and restore the isotropy of the dynamic spin susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> . implies the dependence of @xmath60 on the direction of the zeeman field , because @xmath54 couple @xmath47 to the component of the electron spin perpendicular to the zeeman field . to illustrate this dependence on the zeeman field direction </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a simple contact interaction model for the coupling between the electron and @xmath4he atom spins . </S>",
    "<S> if we set the magnetic field direction as @xmath61 , we can write down the contact interaction as @xmath62 $ ] , giving us @xmath63 . inserting this into eq . </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the electron spin does _ not _ relax at all for perpendicular field ! by contrast , the same model gives us @xmath60 independent of @xmath1 for the surface state of the simplest ti , @xmath64 summation canceling out the spin susceptibility anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> realistic calculation can still give us this drastic anisotropy of spin relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> in @xmath4he - b , the main channel of spin - spin coupling is the dipole - dipole interaction , mainly because an electron strongly avoids contact with @xmath4he atoms . with the dipole - dipole interaction </S>",
    "<S> , we do have coupling between @xmath47 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 , \\label{eq : dipole}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the gyromagnetic ratio of a @xmath4he atom and @xmath68 is the land@xmath69 @xmath68-factor of an electron . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the electron below the liquid surface , the @xmath65 terms of eq . may have little effect ; because @xmath70 for helium atoms ` below ' the electron and @xmath25 for helium atoms ` above ' the electrons , the coupling to @xmath65 from the helium atoms above cancels out the coupling to @xmath65 from the helium atoms below . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin interaction is effectively ising ( that is , @xmath71 ) , we have @xmath0 , as we argued the previous paragraph . by multiplying @xmath72 to the 2d fourier </S>",
    "<S> transform on the coefficient of the @xmath73 term of eq . </S>",

    "<S> whereas in the nmr , we can assume that a nucleus is a point - like object , we can not make the same assumption for electrons in esr and hence the introduction of the static form factor @xmath78 in eq .. due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle , the more delocalized the electron is in the real space , the more rapidly @xmath78 falls off with @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this suppresses the spin relaxation for processes that result in a large momentum change for @xmath4he atoms and hence suppresses @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , @xmath60 is very small for an electron sitting on top of the @xmath4he liquid surface . </S>",
