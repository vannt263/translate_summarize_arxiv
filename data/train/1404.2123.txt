    "traditionally , galaxies have been studied through their surface brightness profiles @xcite . this has not only revealed a wealth of information about their different morphologies but",
    "also hints about their formation processes . de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) first characterised the surface brightness profiles of giant elliptical galaxies as a simple @xmath13 law , which was later also found to fit the bulges of disk galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the disks of spiral galaxies have been traditionally fit with exponential profiles @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that all these profiles are specific cases of a more general @xmath14 function , which fits the surface brightness profile of a large number of galaxies from disks to spheroidals , dwarfs , ellipticals and bulges .",
    "the shape of the surface brightness profile provides valuable clues about the way in which different galaxies formed .",
    "as deeper and more resolved surface brightness data became available , deviations from these simple laws became clearly evident , indicating that galaxy formation was a more complex process than previously believed @xcite .",
    "this discovery motivated the use of multiple components to model the surface brightness profiles of galaxies @xcite bulge - disk decompositions helped distinguish pseudo - bulges ( @xmath15 ) from classical bulges ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "pseudo - bulges are dense central components of disk galaxies that are flattened and rotationally supported and believed to be built out of disk gas .",
    "classical bulges lie on the fundamental plane linking galaxy size , luminosity and velocity dispersion @xcite .    with the advent of deeper imaging ( through hubble space telescope and medium - sized , ground - based telescopes ) , it has become possible to detect additional fainter stellar structures around both normal galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies @xcite today , stellar haloes of galaxies have been observed and confirmed not only in clusters as intracluster light ( icl ) , but also in a large variety of field galaxies from early - type to late - type spirals .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the faint stellar halo is built up from the debris of smaller galaxies and satellites that are tidally disrupted ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the milky way and in other nearby disk galaxies , the stellar halo and other tidal features have been directly detected through star counts @xcite . observing the stellar halo through star counts is limited to the local universe .",
    "the integrated light from deep imaging has enabled studies of the stellar haloes of more distant elliptical and spiral galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . by using modest aperture telescopes @xcite with innovative telescope design optimised for low surface brightness emission @xcite",
    ", one can reduce the systematic errors related to flat fielding and the complex point spread function ( psfs ) of the telescope and reach much deeper limiting depths of @xmath17 .    alternatively , stacking the images of a large number of similar galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) enables one to study the average stellar haloes of statistical samples of more distant galaxies .",
    "the disadvantage is that information on detailed structure is lost .",
    "@xcite used stacking techniques to study the stellar haloes of edge - on disk galaxies ; @xcite studied the stellar haloes of luminous red galaxies out to @xmath18 .",
    "theoretical models @xcite predict not only large variations between individual stellar haloes of galaxies , but also systematic variations in the average properties of stellar haloes as a function of certain galaxy parameters ( for example , halo mass , stellar mass , galaxy bulge - to - disk ratio , etc ) . in order to constrain theoretical models for the formation of stellar haloes ,",
    "it is important to study the average properties of the surface brightness profiles of galaxies as a function of these galaxy parameters . in this paper",
    ", we stack a large number of galaxy images and study them as a function of stellar mass and galaxy type ( late - type or early - type ) .",
    "the sdss imaging data set is well - suited to study the faint stellar haloes of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the systematics of stacking many sdss images to produce a very deep image have been well understood and quantified .",
    "this is important because studying low - surface brightness structures is highly dependent on a proper estimation and removal of the sky background .",
    "we pay particular attention to the residual sky background obtained after stacking the sky - subtracted images from sdss dr9 .",
    "we then model the surface brightness profile of the stacked galaxy including the stellar halo through multi - component fits .",
    "we then parametrise the contribution of the stellar halo by deriving the fraction of light in the outer component of the galaxy .    in section [ sec : selection ] , we describe how we select and prepare our galaxy images for stacking . in section [ sec : stacking ] , we describe in detail the stacking procedure , our error analysis , psf analysis and the methodology we employ to derive the ellipticity , surface brightness and the colour profiles for each galaxy stack . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we present the surface brightness and colour as a function of the stellar mass of the galaxy and of galaxy type . in section [ sec : modelling ] , we fit models to these surface brightness profiles and determine the fraction of light in the outer faint stellar component . in section [ sec : summary ] , we summarise and in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results in light of our theoretical understanding of the formation of stellar haloes of galaxies . throughout this paper , we assume a flat @xmath19cdm cosmology , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and hubble parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we select isolated central galaxies from the mpa - jhu sdss spectroscopic ` value - added ' catalogue in the stellar mass range @xmath3 and in the redshift range @xmath23 .. the stellar mass estimates in the mpa - jhu catalogue were derived from fits to the sdss fibre photometry and the total ` modelmag ` photometry .",
    "] we apply the isolation criterion outlined in @xcite : a galaxy of apparent @xmath0-band magnitude @xmath24 is considered isolated if there are no galaxies in the spectroscopic catalogue at a projected radius @xmath25 and velocity offset @xmath26 with magnitude @xmath27 , and none within @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "we remove all edge - on disk galaxies to avoid adverse psf effects along the minor axis @xcite by choosing only those galaxies with isophotal minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath31 .",
    "we construct mosaics ( 1200 x 1200 pixels ) in the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath32 bands centred on each galaxy using the sky - subtracted sdss data release 9 images and ` swarp ` @xcite .",
    "galaxies were removed if found unsuitable for stacking .",
    "first , galaxy images with a bright source with an @xmath0-band petrosian magnitude greater than 12.0 and within a distance of 1 mpc from the centre of the galaxy were removed . secondly ,",
    "if the masking algorithm ( outlined later ) failed due to crowded fields , the galaxy image was discarded . finally , we calculated a histogram of the difference between each galaxy mosaic after masking and transformation ( see later ) and the stacked image .",
    "galaxy mosaics lying more than @xmath33 from the mean were discarded .",
    "the final sample contains a total of 45508 galaxies .    for our later analysis",
    ", we will stack according to stellar mass and concentration .",
    "for the stellar mass stacks , we stack galaxies in stellar mass bins of 0.1 dex . for the highest mass bin we stack in a bin size of 0.4 dex .",
    "each stack contains both early and late - type galaxies : late - type galaxies dominate the stacks of lower stellar mass whereas early - type galaxies are predominant at high stellar masses .",
    "we can parametrise the shape of the galaxy by using the concentration index @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the radii containing 90 and 50 per cent of the petrosian @xmath0-band luminosity of the galaxy ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that @xmath37 marks the transition from late - type to early - type morphologies @xcite . in order to study the stellar halo separately for late - type and early - type galaxy morphologies",
    ", we divide our sample into stellar mass bins of 0.2 dex with a further separation of each stack into high concentration ( @xmath38 ) and low concentration galaxies ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the number of galaxies in each stack is displayed visually in figure [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "conservative masking was employed by using multiple runs of ` sextractor ` @xcite to create segmentation maps . for this purpose",
    ", the mosaics of three bands were stacked together to make a ` master image ' , from which several segmentation masks were created to deal with various types of background and overlapping objects .",
    "we used a minimum detection area of 5 pixels , a gaussian filter for detection and a detection threshold of @xmath40 to create all the masks .",
    "for the background detection , we use three variations .",
    "we first calculated the mask with a global background .",
    "we then calculate the mask with a local background size of 256 pixels with a filter of 20 pixels .",
    "later we calculated a mask with a smaller background size of 128 pixels with a similar filter size . to deal with extended faint objects ,",
    "a mask was also created by convolving the master image with an @xmath41 pixel top hat kernel before running ` sextractor ` .",
    "each of these masks were successively applied to individual @xmath1 and @xmath0-band mosaics .",
    "the @xmath32-band mosaics were only used for creating the master images for the masking procedure .",
    "the masked mosaics were then transformed to @xmath42 with the flux - conserving iraf task ` geotran ` .",
    "this involves both a cosmological surface brightness dimming @xmath43 and an image rescaling .",
    "for the final transformed mosaic at @xmath42 , @xmath44 . the mosaics were further cropped to a uniform size of @xmath45  pixels ( @xmath46  kpc at @xmath47 ) and corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite .",
    "we ignored @xmath48-corrections in scaling the images as they tend to be minimal at @xmath49 .",
    "a sizable number of the final transformed images are oversampled .",
    "however , for the redshift shift range chosen for our sample @xmath50 , this does not significantly affect the noise characteristics of our final transformed images .",
    "a final run of sextractor was used to determine the position angle of the galaxy in the @xmath0-band mosaic .",
    "this position angle is measured by calculating the second - order moments of the intensity distribution and corresponds to surface brightness threshhold @xmath51 , or a radius of @xmath5210 kpc .",
    "each mosaic was then rotated using ` geotran ` such that the major axis of each galaxy was aligned .",
    "we note that combining galaxy images into mosaics may introduce additional systematics .",
    "@xcite compared the mosaics created from the sky - subtracted images of dr9 and those created directly from the raw images and found that they yield equivalent results .",
    "the sky subtraction in dr9 @xcite is a remarkable improvement from early data releases especially for the extended low surface brightness regions around low - redshift galaxies .",
    "@xcite calculate the residual sky background by measuring the mean surface brightness in random patches of size 13 x 13 native sdss pixels marked as  sky \" in the sdss pipeline across all imaging runs ( see figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "these residuals become significant at depths beyond @xmath53 .",
    "we will discuss this further in the next section .",
    "each stack contains between 1000 and 5000 galaxies with an average of 3000 galaxies .",
    "the mosaic images in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands were stacked using the iraf task ` imcombine ` , by taking the mean value of each pixel after clipping at the 10th and 90th percentiles .",
    "the images were not weighted in the stacking process so as not to bias the sample .",
    "the masked parts of the images were not used when calculating the mean value in ` imcombine ` . to make the stacking computationally easier ,",
    "the final stacks were built by combining equal stacks of around @xmath54 galaxy images each . by working in narrow",
    "mass bin ranges , we avoid the difficult problem of normalising the size of images in each bin prior to stacking .",
    "the background `` sky '' for individual dr9 images consists of the residual sky background and light from undetected ( unmasked ) galaxies . in the appendix [ appendix :",
    "light ] , we quantify the level of light from undetected sources . this tends to be minimal due to the strict masking procedures employed and the fact that we only select isolated galaxies .    to estimate the residual sky background for the stacked image",
    ", we calculate the mean intensity in an annulus between 280 and 320 kpc ( 400 - 450 pixels ) from the centre of the stacked image .",
    "we assume that this background is constant over the whole image . to calculate the uncertainty in this background estimation , we calculate the standard deviation of the mean calculated in patches of 16 x 16 pixels within this annulus .    with the standard sdss imaging , it is possible to extract radial surface brightness profiles down to @xmath55 @xcite . with a better residual background estimation of high s",
    "/ n stacked dr9 images , it is possible to go significantly deeper . in figure",
    "[ fig : limiting_mag ] , we plot the uncertainty in the residual background estimation and the corresponding limiting depth in the @xmath0-band as a function of the number of co - added objects .",
    "the uncertainty in the residual background estimation can be fit by the function @xmath56 .      for stacks of a few thousand galaxies , the formal uncertainty in the stacked surface brightness profiles at larger radii",
    "is dominated by the uncertainty in subtracting the background sky , which consists of camera noise plus extragalactic background radiation originating in the stellar populations of galaxies at moderate to high redshift .",
    "these uncertainties calculated as described in the previous section are depicted as solid error bars in the plots discussed in the next section .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty that arises from the sky subtraction , it is interesting to consider the variance that arises from the fact that similar galaxies may have stellar haloes with quite different masses and sizes .",
    "this can be quantified for each pixel in our final @xmath1 and @xmath0 band stacks through a bootstrapping procedure . for each bin ,",
    "3000 stacks were created with repetition and the variance in each pixel is calculated for each band .",
    "this gives the total uncertainty of each pixel .",
    "after accounting for the formal uncertainty , the variance in the surface brightness profiles can be calculated and is depicted as shaded regions in the plots .    to verify that the faint outer stellar halo visible in our stacks between @xmath57 is not a product of systematics in the data or due to our stacking procedure",
    ", we created equivalent background stacks ( nearly 3000 images ) for each bin by choosing a location 5 mpc away from the centre of the galaxy in a random direction where no large galaxies were found within a distance of 1 x 1 mpc .",
    "we found that evaluating the background at these very large distances made no difference to our results .",
    "the psf flattens the ellipticity and the surface brightness profiles at the centre of the galaxy at radii less than @xmath58 kpc . for deep images ,",
    "the light in the faint outskirts of the stack can be dominated by the scattered light from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "failure to account for the difference in the extended wings of the psf , especially in the @xmath32-band , can lead to a reddening of the colour of the stellar halo @xcite .",
    "this is very visible along the minor axis of edge - on disk galaxies where the surface brightness decreases faster than the profile of the wings of the psf .",
    "we choose not to deconvolve the stacked galaxy profiles .",
    "the effect of the psf is much smaller in our work than that of @xcite due to the fact that the galaxies are much closer in redshift .",
    "for data interpretation purposes , we will model the two - dimensional stacked image of the galaxy convolved with the average psf .",
    "we have thus constructed average psf stacks in the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath32 bands by combining the synthetic psfs created using robert lupton s read atlas images code and stacked bright star images according to the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "the psf profiles for the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath32 bands are shown in figure [ fig : psf ] .",
    "due to the fact that the psfs in the @xmath1 and in the @xmath59 bands are similar ( see also fig 2 of @xcite as well as fig 6 of @xcite ) , our @xmath1-@xmath0 colour profiles are not significantly affected by psf effects , especially in the outer parts of the profiles .",
    "however , the @xmath32-band psf does differ significantly ( see figure [ fig : psf ] ) in having wings that extend to much larger distances .",
    "we therefore avoid the use of the sdss @xmath32-band .",
    "measuring the ellipticity can help quantify the shape of the average stellar halo .",
    "the ellipticity profiles ( @xmath60 ) for each of the aligned galaxy stacks are determined by generating intensity contours at various distances from the centre of the stacked image of the galaxies in the @xmath0-band . for deriving contours which were greater than 20 pixels away from the centre of the galaxy stack , we smooth the image with a gaussian filter with a width of 3 pixels .",
    "for contours beyond 60 pixels from the centre of the galaxy stack , we smooth the image with a larger gaussian filter ( width of 5 pixels ) .    in figure [",
    "fig : stellarmassbinellip ] , we plot ellipticity profiles out to radii of 30 - 50 kpc for our stacks divided according to stellar mass and concentration .",
    "information on the shape of stellar haloes can be inferred from the average ellipticity profiles for each stack . only the inner part ( @xmath61 ) of the ellipticity profile is significantly affected by the psf .",
    "the outer parts of the ellipticity profile show a gradual change in ellipticity with radius .",
    "the ellipticity profile of the stacks of lower stellar mass decreases as the radius increases , i.e. for these galaxies the outer part of the stellar halo is more circular than the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "the ellipticity of the outer part of the stellar halo increases as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "the highest stellar mass bins have a maximum outer ellipticity of @xmath63 , which remains approximately constant from 30 to 50 kpc . in figure",
    "[ fig : image_contours ] , we show the stacked image of high concentration galaxies stacked in the mass range @xmath64 along with elliptical contours drawn at various radii .",
    "we find that the stellar haloes of low concentration galaxies tend to be spherical , while the stellar haloes of high concentration galaxies tend to be elliptical . at fixed mass ,",
    "the ellipticity of the highest stellar mass , high concentration galaxies reaches values of 0.2 and is approximately constant from 20 to 100 kpc .",
    "by contrast , the measured ellipticity ( @xmath65 ) of low concentration galaxies is around 0.1 .",
    "are these results consistent with other measurements ?",
    "the stellar halo of m31 can easily be measured out to large distances and is found to be nearly spherical @xcite . at 80 kpc for high concentration high stellar mass galaxies ,",
    "the measured ellipticity is @xmath66 .",
    "this is also consistent with the ellipticity of the stellar halo of lrgs measured by @xcite which lies around @xmath67 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite measured the axial ratio of the milky way stellar halo out to a distance of 35 kpc and estimated it as @xmath68 , i.e. an ellipticity of 0.3 , which lies outside the range spanned by our estimates .",
    "this may imply that the milky way s halo is unusual .",
    "we note , however , that when stacking aligned galaxies together , we assume that the outer stellar halo is also aligned with the shape of the galaxy . if this were not the case , it would lead to a systematic uncertainty in the intrinsic ellipticity which would increase with radius . as a result ,",
    "the ellipticity measured is a lower limit on the true average intrinsic ellipticities of the stellar haloes of the galaxies which make up the stack .",
    "convolving the stacked images creates additional measurement uncertainties .    using these ellipticity profiles , we derive surface brightness in the @xmath0 band and @xmath1-@xmath0 colour profiles in elliptical annuli after background subtraction . at radii where the ellipticity estimates are no longer reliable",
    ", we assume that the ellipticity profile flattens out at the furthermost determined value of the ellipticity .",
    "in figure [ fig : stellarmassbin ] , we show the average surface brightness profiles and the average @xmath1-@xmath0 colour profiles for our galaxy stacks in stellar mass bins .",
    "the surface brightness profiles extend reliably to a depth of @xmath69 .",
    "the profiles of highest mass bins reach out to 100 - 150 kpc , while the lower mass bins extend up to 60 - 100 kpc . the surface brightness profile of the stellar halo show variations with stellar mass .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the trend in the surface brightness profiles in the stellar mass range @xmath70 is consistent with the theoretical predictions . in this paper , we extend the analysis down to @xmath71 ; comparison with model predictions will form the subject of a future paper .    the triangle markers in the colour profiles indicate the average @xmath36 ( the radius enclosing 50 per cent of the petrosian @xmath0-band luminosity of the galaxy ) for each mass bin . for each mass bin , there is a flattening in the colour profile and a hint of an upturn beyond the average @xmath36 indicating that we may be seeing the effects of an older accreted component .",
    "we will quantify this in more detail in the next section .      in figure",

    "the single - srsic function fits the symmetric central high s / n part of the surface brightness profile up to a surface brightness of @xmath72 reaching out to 30 kpc .",
    "note that all internal galaxy components ( e.g. bulges , disks , pseudo - bulges ) are averaged out and incorporated into the single - srsic fit .",

    "the residuals are shown in the panel below in figure [ fig : model_fits ] .",
    "the residuals of the double - srsic are less than @xmath73 across the whole radial range ( 0 - 120 kpc ) of the galaxy stack .",
    "the residuals at the centre are attributed to the asymmetric part of the intensity distribution at centre of the galaxy stack due to the various internal galaxy components mentioned above .",
    "we find that the double - srsic profile provides a much better fit for all high concentration galaxies across all mass bin ranges .",
    "this can be seen visually by calculating and comparing the residuals of the image beyond @xmath74 kpc for each model .",
    "significant deviations are only seen in the lower two mass bins .",
    "the fits to the lowest mass bin is not perfect due to limited number of galaxy images ( @xmath75 ) which went into the stack . at first glance , our conclusion that a double - srsic profile is _ always _ required may seem surprising , because the surface brightness profiles of massive galaxies with high concentration do not exhibit a clear inflexion point .",
    "we note that a single - srsic model has a single fixed ellipticity , while the double - srsic model with different ellipticities for each component can in a limited way mimic the varying ellipticity of the stacked galaxy image .",
    "we investigated whether the change in ellipticity is the dominant factor that favours a double - srsic profile over a single - srsic profile . to test this",
    ", we compare a single - srsic and a double - srsic profile fitted to similar stacks of galaxies which are not aligned but are randomly oriented . in all cases , the double - srsic is still preferred over the single - srsic profile .",
    "the factor @xmath76 in the randomly oriented case is reduced to one - third of that as calculated in table [ table3 ] .",
    "this indicates that it is both the surface brightness profile and the ellipticity which contribute to favour a double - srsic profile over a single - srsic profile .",
    "plots of the srsic indices of the two components as a function of mass are shown in in figure [ fig : conc_n1n2 ] .",

    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows .    1 .   the fraction of accreted stellar material increases with stellar mass .",
    "at fixed mass , the fraction of accreted material is higher in early - type than in late - type galaxies . 2 .",
    "the stellar haloes of high concentration galaxies ( @xmath38 ) tend to be more elliptical than those of low concentration galaxies ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the ellipticity of the outer stellar halo increases strongly with stellar mass for high concentration galaxies , and more weakly with stellar mass for low concentration galaxies . 3 .",
    "because we stack galaxies that are nearly face - on , we are only able to probe the colour of the outer accreted component in high concentration galaxies . in these systems ,",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath0 colour of the outer halo light is bluer than than the centre of the galaxy and is an increasing function of stellar mass .",
    "we find that a single - srsic profile can not fit the entire two - dimensional surface brightness distribution of any of our stacked images .",
    "multi - component models are needed to model the excess light in the outer parts of the galaxy , especially between @xmath108 , and to account for the radial dependence of the ellipticity of the light distribution .",
    "double - srsic profiles adequately model the surface brightness distributions of high concentration galaxies ( @xmath38 ) , while triple - srsic profiles are often needed to model the surface brightness profile of low concentration galaxies ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "6 .   using the fraction of light in the outer component of our models as a measure of the fraction of the total stellar mass composed of accreted stellar material , we find that this fraction is an increasing function of stellar mass . at fixed stellar mass ,",
    "it is also a function of concentration . for high concentration galaxies , the fraction of accreted stellar light rises from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , while for low concentration galaxies the fraction of stellar light rises from @xmath11 to @xmath12 for galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "we have attempted to characterise the stellar halo of galaxies through modelling their surface brightness .",
    "it is the depth , the large dynamic range and the two - dimensional shape information ( ellipticity ) of our surface brightness profiles which enables us to recognise deviations from a single component profile and to model successfully the stellar halo of our galaxy stacks out to 100 kpc with two or three components .",
    "an important outcome is that a single srsic component can not fit the surface brightness profiles of high concentration galaxies over a large dynamic range in radius and surface brightness , but can only fit the inner parts of galaxies .",
    "the inability of a single srsic to fit the two - dimensional surface brightness profile of galaxies has also been confirmed by the studies of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "multi - component models are needed to model the full two - dimensional surface brightness profiles of galaxies .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is both the average shape of the surface brightness profile and the radial variation in ellipticity of the light in a galaxy stacks that constrain such models .    for high concentration galaxies ,",
    "the effective radius of the outer component is twice as large as the effective radius of the inner component . for low concentration galaxies ,",
    "the effective radius of the outer component is much larger than the inner components . for high concentration galaxies ,",
    "the luminosity of the outer component is a significant fraction of the total luminosity of the galaxy and ranges from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "it also dominates over a large radial range of the galaxy . on the other hand , in low concentration galaxies",
    ", the outer component occupies a smaller fraction ( from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ) and is only dominant at radii larger than @xmath109 kpc . in both cases ,",
    "the fraction of light in the outer component increases with stellar mass ( see the red line in the top plots of figure [ fig : light - fraction_lc ] and figure [ fig : light - fraction_uc ] ) .",
    "we propose in this work that the fraction of light in the outer component provides a measure of the amount of accreted stellar light in the galaxy . while a direct one - to - one correspondence between the fraction of light in the outer component and the fraction of accreted stellar light can not be directly proven , the trends in the fraction of light in the outer component agree qualitatively with the trends of the accreted light fraction as a function of mass and galaxy - type in the particle - tagging models of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the rate of increase of accreted stellar mass increases dramatically above @xmath110 .",
    "interestingly , this corresponds to the stellar mass where galaxies transition from blue / star - forming to red / passive systems @xcite .",
    "a significant jump in the accreted mass fraction may be most simply explained by _ in - situ _ growth of the galaxy being terminated by feedback processes , such as energy injection from relativistic jets produced by black holes in massive galaxies @xcite . in the two stage model of massive galaxy formation proposed by @xcite , an early , rapid _ in - situ _ star formation period is followed by a late merger - dominated period . in the later phase , galaxies tend to grow predominately through minor mergers .",
    "we note that the particle tagging models of @xcite are directly tied to semi - analytic models that include agn feedback prescription , and thus also include quenching of _ in - situ _ growth of galaxies through cooling and star formation . in future work",
    ", we intend to undertake a detailed comparison with these models .    measuring the ellipticity of the outer stellar halo of galaxy",
    "also provides us with hints about the formation processes for the stellar halo .",
    "a high ellipticity is likely to imply that satellite systems are preferentially accreted along the major axis of the main galaxy @xcite .",
    "the variance in the outer stellar halo profile between different galaxies can be predicted from our surface brightness profiles .",
    "this variance results from the fact that similar galaxies can have stellar haloes with very different masses , sizes and shapes",
    ". the physical origin of this variance as predicted by the @xmath19cdm models , is that galaxies of the same mass have had a range of merger histories , resulting in different accreted stellar mass fractions .",
    "this has also been clearly demonstrated using particle - tagging techniques on the aquarius haloes @xcite , which show very large halo - to - halo differences .",
    "we also note that the integrated surface brightness of the galaxy , including the stellar halo , includes considerably more light that measured by the sdss ` model ` and ` cmodel ` magnitudes .",
    "for example , for high concentration galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath64 , there is about 50% more light contained in the stellar halo at surface brightnesses greater than @xmath111 .",
    "this implies that there is considerably more stellar material in the galaxy that one might infer from the sdss photometry .",
    "the stellar masses defined by the mpa - jhu catalogue and used in this work are only used to define the stellar mass bins , and are systematically less than the true stellar mass of the galaxy .",
