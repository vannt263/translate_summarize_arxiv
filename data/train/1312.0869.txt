    "the experimental realization of annular trapping potentials  @xcite has recently led to the observation of persistent superfluid flow in a multiply - connected geometry  @xcite .",
    "the question of the stability of these superfluid currents is a complex matter and depends on the nature of the dynamical excitations available to the system .",
    "the current consensus is that stability is limited by the penetration of vortices through the edge of the superfluid with a concomitant change in the phase of the superfluid order parameter .",
    "several theoretical studies support this scenario  @xcite .",
    "however , underlying these dynamical instabilities is the inherent metastability of the superfluid system .",
    "as emphasized by bloch  @xcite , this metastability is revealed through the energy of the superfluid as a function of its angular momentum , its so - called yrast spectrum  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the yrast spectrum of a two - component bose gas in the ring geometry .",
    "specifically , we have in mind the situation in which the atoms are confined to a torus where the transverse confinement is so tight that the system is effectively one - dimensional . when the two species have equal masses @xmath0",
    ", it can be shown quite generally  @xcite that the yrast spectrum takes the form e_0(l ) = + e_0(l ) , where @xmath1 is the radius of the ring , @xmath2 is the total angular momentum and @xmath3 is the total mass of the system . here , @xmath4 is the total number of atoms of type @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath7 has inversion symmetry and possesses the periodicity property @xmath8    the above properties of the yrast spectrum are independent of the detailed nature of the inter - particle interactions  @xcite . for contact interactions",
    ", the interactions can be characterised by the dimensionless parameters @xmath9 where the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 take on the values @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "( a detailed definition of these interaction parameters is given in sec .",
    "ii . ) however , as shown in several previous studies  @xcite , the _ mean - field _ yrast spectrum of the two - component system , with the added restriction that all interaction strengths have a common value @xmath12 , exhibits two additional properties .",
    "first , the part of the spectrum in the fundamental range @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , is not in general an analytic function of the ( dimensionless ) angular momentum per particle . in particular , the derivative of the spectrum is found to exhibit discontinuities at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the minority concentration and @xmath17 . the number of discontinuities @xmath18 depends on the two relevant parameters of the model , namely @xmath12 and @xmath19 .",
    "more specifically , it was established that @xmath18 derivative discontinuities occur when the coordinate @xmath20 lies within a region bounded by the two critical curves @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the @xmath12-@xmath19 plane  @xcite .",
    "these curves are illustrated by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ gammaxb ] for @xmath23 .",
    "importantly , the point of non - analyticity , @xmath24 , is associated with the condensate wavefunctions having a plane - wave form , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . as a result , the relevant critical @xmath27 curves in fig .  [ gammaxb ]",
    "can also be viewed as defining the regions within which plane - wave yrast states emerge . for values of @xmath28 other than these special values ,",
    "the yrast state is in general a soliton state .",
    "now , because of the periodicity and inversion symmetry of @xmath7 , a derivative discontinuity at @xmath29 implies discontinuities at @xmath30 as well , where @xmath31 is any non - zero integer .",
    "the yrast states at these angular momenta are @xmath32 .",
    "the second important property of the yrast spectrum concerns a subset of such non - analytic points , namely those at @xmath33 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the yrast spectrum has local minima at these angular momenta ( and only these from all possible @xmath30 ) for any integer @xmath18 provided @xmath12 exceeds the critical interaction strength _",
    "this expression provides another set of critical @xmath21 curves , which are indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ gammaxb ] .",
    "since a local minimum at @xmath34 necessarily implies that the corresponding state @xmath35 is already an yrast state , @xmath36 is thus a sufficient , but not necessary , condition for the existence of plane - wave yrast states .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ gammaxb ] are displaced to the right of the solid curves ; with increasing @xmath12 for a fixed @xmath19 , one first crosses a solid curve at which point some plane - wave state becomes an yrast state , and then the dashed curve beyond which this plane - wave state is a local minimum .",
    "the existence of an energy minimum is of particular significance since , as argued by bloch  @xcite , it implies the possibility of persistent superfluid flow .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath36 can be taken as the stability condition for persistent currents at the angular momentum @xmath37 .     and",
    "@xmath22 , the plane - wave states @xmath38 , with @xmath39 are yrast states . the critical curve for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , is not shown .",
    "the dashed lines are critical curves defining the regions in which the @xmath42 state supports persistent currents . ]",
    "the above conclusions , pertaining to a system with symmetrical interaction strengths , were reached with aid of analytic soliton solutions to the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations , from which the full yrast spectrum could be determined  @xcite .",
    "these conclusions were confirmed by smyrnakis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using an alternative approach .",
    "since the symmetrical model is rather special , it is unclear whether the aforementioned properties of the mean - field yrast spectrum remain valid for the asymmetrical model in which the interparticle interactions take on different values .",
    "this is the main question to be addressed in this paper . to answer it we adopt the strategy , motivated by the symmetrical model , of examining the mean - field energy functional in the vicinity of plane - wave states .",
    "even though analytic soliton solutions are not known for the asymmetrical model , we are able to use a perturbative analysis to determine the general behaviour of the energy functional near plane - wave states and obtain critical conditions analogous to those displayed in fig .",
    "[ gammaxb ] .",
    "since all of the results for the symmetrical model are recovered by this approach , we are confident that the conditions we derive do in fact determine the stability of persistent currents in the asymmetrical model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ stability ] , we derive inequalities involving the system parameters which establish whether a given plane - wave state is a local minimum of the gross - pitaevskii energy functional .",
    "such a state has a specific angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "we then argue that the lowest - energy plane - wave state having this angular momentum is a global minimum if the inequalities for this state are satisfied and , hence , is an yrast state .",
    "these predictions are then checked against known limiting situations , including that of the symmetric model . in sec .",
    "[ critical_conditions ] we then analyze in more detail the behaviour of the yrast spectrum in the vicinity of a plane - wave state corresponding to a global minimum .",
    "we first establish that the yrast spectrum has a derivative discontinuity at the angular momentum @xmath28 of this state .",
    "the instability of persistent currents at this angular momentum is then signalled by the critical condition that one of the slopes of the yrast spectrum vanishes . at this point ,",
    "the plane - wave state is no longer a local minimum .",
    "we then obtain a subsequent critical condition for the disappearance of the derivative discontinuity .",
    "this condition provides a bound for the plane - wave state to be an yrast state .",
    "we conclude this section with some applications of these critical conditions in the determination of plane - wave yrast states .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in the final section .",

    "the yrast spectrum is completely determined by the behaviour of @xmath55 in the interval @xmath58 .",

    "it is useful to note that @xmath16 is in general a rational number which we denote by x_b = where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are positive integers having no common divisor .",
