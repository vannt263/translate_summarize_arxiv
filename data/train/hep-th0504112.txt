    "the imposition of boundary condition on a quantum field leads to the modification of the vacuum energy level and can be observed as an associated vacuum pressure .",
    "this effect ( called casimir effect ) has been predicted by casimir in his original work in 1948@xcite , and has been experimentally observed for electromagnetic field several years later . until now ,",
    "in many theoretical works casimir energy has been computed for various types of boundary geometry and for fields other than electromagnetic one .",

    "we describe quantum field using the canonical formalism .",
    "we obtain the vacuum energy by direct solving the field equations and using the mode summation method . in order to compute the renormalized vacuum energy we use the abel - plana formula .    in order to obtain influence of magnetic field on the casimir energy another methods",
