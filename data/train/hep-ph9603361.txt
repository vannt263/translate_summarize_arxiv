    "<S> finally there is the practical limitation that photons can only be measured if they are emitted at sufficiently large angles to the proton beam direction in the hera laboratory frame , say @xmath116 the allowed regions of the kinematic variables @xmath117 describing the photon are shown in fig .  3 for various choices of @xmath118 . </S>",
