    "a train of square voltage pulses at a frequency of few hundreds hz is applied to the gate that directly affects the quantum dot potential ( in addition to its dc voltage ) .",
    "this shifts the energy levels of the dot in time , inducing charge transitions whenever the dot s single - particle levels come into resonance with the lead s fermi energy .",
    "an electron can be loaded from the reservoir into the dot during the upper phase of the pulse and unloaded during the lower phase ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt ] ( a ) ) .",

    "this technique allows one to probe both ground and excited states for each @xmath0 , as long as the relaxation rate is slower than the pulse frequency and the pulse magnitude spans the relevant energy separation .",
    "the measured spectrum reveals that the energy separation between the first excited orbital state and the ground state varies between 1 - 8mev according to dot s occupancy .",

    "the energy scale on the y - axis is obtained by converting the gate voltage into electrochemical potential using the appropriate lever arm conversion factor ( @xmath117 0.3 ev / v ) .",
    "the vertical shift of each trace is arbitrary and does not reflect the quantum dot charging energy . a strong sensing signal is due to charge transfers to / from the quantum dot .",
    "hence , the observed magnetic field dependence maps the filling of spin - valley states for individual electrons .",
    "the slope of e(b ) is given by @xcite : @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath120 is the bohr magneton and @xmath121 is the change in total spin when the @xmath0-th electron is added to the dot .",
    "hence , a slope of @xmath107 indicates a spin - up addition , while a @xmath108 slope is due to a spin - down electron .",
    "solid lines shown in fig .  [ fig : expt ] ( b ) are guides for the eye with slopes @xmath122 , using @xmath123 for bulk si .    to understand the interplay between spin and valley degrees of freedom in a magnetic field , we analyse individual charge additions .",
    "the first transition ( @xmath124 ) reveals that for low magnetic fields the slope is positive up to @xmath125 , where a change of sign occurs ; hence , a spin - up ( spin - down ) electron is loaded into the dot for low ( high ) b - fields . for the first electron addition",
    ", one would expect to fill the spin - down lower valley eigenstate ( the ground state ) at all b - field values ( see red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt](c ) ) .",
    "however , the measurements indicate that the excited ( ground ) state of the lower @xmath126 ( upper @xmath127 ) valley is probed for this transition for @xmath128 @xmath129 .",
    "this occurs because the tunnelling rate between the dot and the lead in our measurement is faster than the relaxation rate , so that the largest contribution to the sensing signal comes from the loading / unloading of the excited states . using fig .",
    "[ fig : expt](c ) we can explain the presence of the kink ( change of slope sign ) .",
    "for increasing magnetic fields the states @xmath130 and @xmath131 cross , making it energetically favourable for a spin - down electron to charge the dot .",
    "the position of the kink reveals the valley - orbit splitting , which coincides with the zeeman splitting , as @xmath132 = 0.23 mev , yielding @xmath133 mev .    the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt ] ( b ) for the @xmath134 transition is similar to that for @xmath124 .",
    "the ground state for @xmath135 is spin - down for all b. the spin - filling measurements reveal that for low b a spin - up electron is added to form a singlet which fully occupies the @xmath136 valley eigenstate . however",
    ", at larger b , a kink occurs at the same @xmath137 as for @xmath135 .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath138 a spin - down electron is added to form the triplet @xmath139 .",
    "the antisymmetry of the 2-electron wave - function requires one electron to occupy an excited state ; here , this is the + valley eigenstate , which is significantly lower than the first excited orbital state @xcite .",
    "the observed change of slope is due to a singlet - triplet crossing and , once again , the zeeman and valley - orbit splittings coincide at @xmath109 .    for @xmath140",
    ", we again observe a change of slope at @xmath109 , but unlike the previous cases , the electron added at low ( high ) fields is spin - down ( spin - up ) . to understand this",
    ", we note that for @xmath128 the 2-electron ground state is a spin singlet that fully occupies the lower valley eigenstate .",
    "the next available state would be a spin - down in the upper valley eigenstate .",
    "however , for @xmath138 the 2-electron ground state switches to @xmath139 , which would allow one more electron in the lower valley eigenstate . this can only be spin - up because of pauli exclusion .",
    "the change of slope at the same field value as for the previous transitions confirms that @xmath133 mev for @xmath3 as well .",
    "these measurements confirm that the voc is independent of @xmath0 up to @xmath3 , corroborating the prediction that @xmath57 is negligible .",
    "the underlying physics of this problem is contained in the two - electron case .",
    "we have seen that the ground state for @xmath141 is dependent on the magnitude of the quantity @xmath57 , which can also be understood as representing _",
    "intervalley exchange_. it is worth noting that @xmath57 is the _ only _ exchange parameter appearing in this problem .",
    "the central message of this work is that there is a negligible gain in coulomb energy for an electron to switch valley states .",
    "fundamentally , @xmath57 is small because the coulomb interaction varies on longer spatial scales than that set by the separation of the valleys in reciprocal space , which corresponds to @xmath142 in real space . in other words , @xmath57 is suppressed by valley interference .",
    "interaction effects are not expected to be observable even if @xmath143 , since @xmath57 corresponds to a few mk , while typical temperatures in a dilution refrigerator are @xmath144100mk . for any realistic si two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , the ground state of a multivalley two - electron single quantum dot is a spin singlet @xcite .    for @xmath145 and @xmath4",
    "we have no new matrix elements .",
    "we note , however , that the eigenvalues of the @xmath145 case are doubly degenerate .",
    "operating such a quantum dot as a qubit presents the same scalability issues as in ref .  .",
    "briefly , although single qubit operations can be performed regardless of the state in which the system is initialized , two - qubit operations typically depend on exchange , which can be vastly different for different valley configurations .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that in few - electron quantum dots the voc has no significant contribution from electron - electron interactions .",
    "we expect these findings to be generalizable to @xmath146 , since valley interference and spinor overlaps are equally relevant to higher orbital excited states .",
    "conceptually , this proves that interactions are not sharp enough in real space to couple valleys , which have a large separation in @xmath147-space .",
    "together with previous research @xcite , it shows that the voc is fully determined by the properties of the interface : the size and shape of the interface potential step , electric field and roughness profile .",
    "these findings will aid experimentalists working on quantum computing in si and other materials with valleys , such as c and ge .",
    "the valley degree of freedom can be a significant impediment to single - spin and singlet - triplet qubits @xcite , and it is essential for their operation that the voc be fully characterised , since valleys complicate the spin state spectrum on a fundamental level .",
    "the size of the voc and its sensitivity to interactions and occupation number is also a critical ingredient of valley qubits @xcite , which may reduce sensitivity to noise .",
