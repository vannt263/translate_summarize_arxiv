    ", it appears in multiple - scale expansions of various physical systems , where it describes the evolution of wave packets .",
    "eq.([nw ] ) is the off - diagonal @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) first order partial differential equation ( pde ) with quadratic nonlinearity of special form and @xmath5 different directional derivatives @xmath6 along the vectors @xmath7 with the coordinates @xmath8 however , its natural higher dimensional generalization is not integrable .",
    "an example of ( partially ) integrable multidimensional generalization of eq .",
    "( [ nw ] ) has a significantly deformed structure .",
    "one of its version possessing the periodic lump solution is found in @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear pde discussed in this paper reads ( written in components ) @xmath9 here @xmath10 are @xmath3 matrix fields and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are constant coefficients having a special structure shown below in eqs.([c1]-[c3 ] ) .",
    "the structure of this equation differs from that of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0-wave equation ( [ nw ] ) , in particular , it involves @xmath14 matrix fields @xmath10 instead of the single one .",
    "similar to eq.([nw ] ) , eq.([nwave ] ) has the quadratic nonlinearity and @xmath15 directional derivatives @xmath16 .",
    "since we have the five - dimensional space of independent variables , there are five independent directional derivatives .",
    "although the formal identification of different @xmath17 ( more exactly , the reduction @xmath18 with some constant diagonal matrices @xmath2 , @xmath19 ) is admittable by the structure of eq.([nwave ] ) , such the reduction cuts the solution space drastically decreasing its dimensionality , so that the reduced system loses its complete integrability .",
    "the feature of system ( [ nwave ] ) is that its linear limit ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 is the same for all @xmath22 . since eq .",
    "( [ nwave ] ) is linearizable @xcite its solutions are formally related to the solutions of the associated system of linear partial differential equations ( pdes ) ( [ nwave_lin ] ) . deriving this relation , we turn to the spectral representation of solution as an auxiliary tool , and find a spectral function @xmath23 of two spectral parameters .",
    "we call the algorithm deriving @xmath17 in terms of the associated spectral function @xmath24 a dressing algorithm in analogy with the dressing algorithm for equations integrable by istm @xcite .",
    "thus , the paper has the following structure . in sec.[section : dressing ] we represent a particular dressing method which will be used for deriving the system of nonlinear pdes ( [ nwave ] ) .",
    "the supplemented algebraic - differential relations among the fields of this system are derived in sec.[section : relations ] .",
    "solution space to system ( [ nwave ] ) is discussed in sec.[section : solutions ] , where an example of particular solution is given .",
    "basic results are discussed in sec.[section : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the @xmath3 matrix function @xmath25 depending on the two spectral parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 and set of auxiliary parameters @xmath28 , which will be the independent variables of the nonlinear pdes : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are some arbitrary diagonal functions of spectral parameters , @xmath32 are independent arbitrary diagonal functions of spectral parameter , while @xmath33 are linear combinations of @xmath32 , @xmath34 with the diagonal constant matrices @xmath35 . in eq.([r ] ) , @xmath36 is some matrix functions of spectral parameters such that the operator @xmath37 is invertible .",
    "we refer to the inverse of @xmath38 as the spectral function @xmath24 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is some scalar measure on the plane of complex spectral parameter @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the @xmath3 identity operator . differentiating @xmath24 with respect to @xmath43 and taking into account its definition ( [ int ] ) and expression ( [ r ] ) for @xmath38",
    "we obtain @xmath44 @xmath45 system ( [ psix],[psit ] ) can be viewed as a system for the spectral function @xmath24 .",
    "now , applying the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) to eqs.([psix ] ) and ( [ psit ] ) we obtain the system of nonlinear pdes for the matrix fields @xmath50 this system reads : @xmath51 using the proper combination of eqs.([nl1],[nl2 ] ) we can eliminate the fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 writing the system for the fields ( [ field1 ] ) .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath54 we obtain the following nonlinear system ( written in components ) : @xmath55 where we use the following notations : @xmath56 one can see that eq.([spnlin ] ) can be written as eq.([nwave ] ) with @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 the structure of eq.([nwave ] ) is similar to that of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0-wave equation ( [ nw ] ) . in particular , it is off - diagonal and admits the reduction @xmath60 under this reduction , system ( [ nwave ] ) reads @xmath61",
    "according to sec.[section : dressing ] , the off - diagonal elements of the matrix fields @xmath17 , @xmath62 satisfy system ( [ nwave ] ) . in this section",
    "we show that there are natural supplemented algebraic - differential relations among these matrix fields , involving their diagonal elements .",
    "there are three families of such relations .",
    "\\1 . _ the first family _ is represented by the equations of systems ( [ nl1],[nl2 ] ) with @xmath63 : @xmath64 2 . _",
    "the second family _ is represented by the equations of systems ( [ nl1],[nl2 ] ) with @xmath65 . eliminating the fields",
    "@xmath66 we write this family as @xmath67 @xmath68    3._the third family _ is represented by the equations of systems ( [ nl1],[nl2 ] ) with @xmath69 . eliminating the fields @xmath70",
    "we write this family as @xmath71 @xmath72    all relations ( [ r1]-[r3 ] ) have the diagonal parts and involve diagonal elements of all matrix fields @xmath17 , @xmath62",
    ". however , we have to emphasize that the presence of these relations does not reduce the complete integrability of the system ( [ nwave ] ) .",
    "this statement will be clarified in sec.[section : solutions ]",
    "first of all , in this section we show the complete integrability of system ( [ nwave ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we again turn to the spectral representation and derive the explicite form of the spectral function @xmath24 and matrix fields @xmath17 .      to construct the explicite form of @xmath24 we have to invert the operator @xmath38 , i.e. , to solve the integral equation ( [ int ] ) for @xmath24 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath24 can be constructed explicitly up to the invertibility of the integral operator @xmath36 independent on @xmath73- and @xmath74-variables . substituting @xmath38 from ( [ r ] ) we rewrite eq.([int ] ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 assuming the invertibility of @xmath77",
    ", we can write @xmath78 where @xmath79 . then , applying @xmath80 , we can find @xmath24 as @xmath81 the function @xmath82 in the rhs of this equation can be found applying @xmath83 to eq.([psi ] ) and solving the obtained equation for @xmath82 : @xmath84 where we introduce the following notations : @xmath85 applying @xmath86 and @xmath87 to eq.([psi ] ) we obtain : @xmath88 obviously , each of the functions @xmath89 is a solution of the appropriate linear pde ( [ nwave_lin ] ) .",
    "solutions @xmath17 have no singularities if @xmath90 for all @xmath91 and @xmath92 inside of the domain of our interest .",
    "the conclusion regarding the complete integrability of system ( [ nwave ] ) follows from the fact that the function @xmath38 ( [ r0 ] ) has arbitrary dependence on @xmath93 independent functions of spectral parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 thus providing arbitrary functions of @xmath93 independent variables @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is a necessary requirement for complete integrability of the system of @xmath96-dimensional pdes . obviously , the number of these arbitrary matrix functions of @xmath97-variables coincides with the number of fields @xmath17 in system ( [ nwave ] ) .",
    "in fact , these arbitrary functions are nothing but the fields @xmath89 ( [ w ] ) . by construction",
    ", they are independent functions having arbitrary dependence on @xmath93 variables @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    in addition , to satisfy the reduction ( [ red ] ) , we shall impose the following constraints on the functions of spectral parameters @xmath36 and @xmath98 : @xmath99 where the star means the complex conjugate and we take into account the diagonality of @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "in this section we consider the particular solutions @xmath17 under the reduction ( [ red ] ) ( i.e. , solutions of eq .",
    "( [ nwavered ] ) ) constructed using the discrete spectral parameters : @xmath103 with real @xmath104 . as an example we consider the following functions @xmath36 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 satisfying reduction ( [ redrrqs ] ) : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the kronecker symbol . in this case , the fields @xmath17 are given by eq.([v ] ) with @xmath89 defined by eqs.([w ] ) and ( [ r0 ] ) : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the inverse of @xmath36 : @xmath110 the absolute values of some matrix elements of @xmath17 for the case @xmath111 and @xmath112 are depicted in fig.[fig : sol ] on the plane @xmath113 at fixed @xmath114 .",
    "+    we see that all matrix elements of @xmath17 can be separated into three family .",
    "the absolute values of matrix elements from the first family ( of the elements of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , fig.[fig : sol]a ) have high peaks regularly situated on the @xmath113-plane .",
    "the absolute values of the matrix elements from the second family ( of the elements of @xmath117 , fig.[fig : sol]b ) have peaks situated on the oscillating basis . finally , the absolute values of the matrix elements from the third family ( of the elements of @xmath118 , fig.[fig : sol]c ) have no sharp peaks .",
    "so , such @xmath0-wave type equation can be responsible for forming the lump - type quasi - periodic solutions of large amplitude .",
    "we construct a completely integrable linearizable @xmath119-dimensional version of @xmath0-wave type equation for the matrix fields @xmath17 , @xmath62 .",
    "its generalization to @xmath120 , @xmath121 , case is obvious .",
    "we show that the elements of the matrix fields @xmath17 have different shapes . some of them can be viewed as a set of quasi - periodic sharp peaks and thus could be responsible for formation of rogue waves .",
    "it is remarkable , that the auxiliary spectral function @xmath24 was introduced to derive eq.([nwave ] ) , so that fields @xmath17 acquire the spectral representation , similar to the fields of istm - integrable nonlinear pdes .",
    "thus , the dressing method appears here as a tool unifying the nonlinear pdes integrable by different methods .",
    "similar phenomena have been observed in earlier papers @xcite , combining nonlinear pdes integrable by different methods , such as istm , linearization by the hopf substitution , method of characteristics .",
