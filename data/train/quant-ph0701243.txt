    "the roots of quantum metrology has a history that dates back to heisenberg s work in the early years of the previous century  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the phase sensitivity of interferometers is of interest because quantum interferometers may be used as sensors of classical fields  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations limit the precision of phase measurements  @xcite and the phase sensitivity of interferometers has been explored for different types of input states , such as squeezed states and number states , see references contained in  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been experimental progress in making efficient single - photon and entangled - photon sources , and photon number resolving detectors .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on estimating the phase ( and thereby the classical field ) from photon number counts in the output ports of an interferometer .    the phase sensitivity @xmath0 is often discussed according to how it scales in two limits , known as the standard limit ( shot noise ) , @xmath1 @xmath2 , and the heisenberg limit , @xmath3 @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of particles that enter the interferometer during each measurement cycle .",
    "these results are based on standard estimation theory@xcite which connects a continuous valued measurement outcome , @xmath6 , with a corresponding phase , @xmath7 , through a theoretical relation @xmath8 .",
    "the derivation of the heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity implicitly assumes that the phase probability distribution has a single peak . using a bayesian analysis",
    "we have shown that this assumption is not generally true  @xcite , unless we know some prior information about the phase , for example that the phase is in some small region .",
    "we have shown that the phase probability distributions have two peaks when fock states are input into a mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer and they have four peaks when maximally entangled states ( n00n ) are input  @xcite , when there is no prior information about the phase .",
    "consequently , it is not clear whether the phase sensitivity , described in terms of the width of the phase probability distribution for measurement @xmath6 , @xmath9 , should refer to the width of a single peak or to the width of the whole distribution ( containing all the peaks ) . as a result of this ambiguity",
    ", we have proposed a new metric of interferometer phase sensitivity  @xcite , @xmath10 \\label{mutualinformationeq}%\\ ] ] which we call the fidelity .",
    "this is the shannon mutual information between the phase ( a continuous alphabet ) random variable , @xmath11 , and the photon - number measurement outcomes ( a discrete alphabet ) with random variable @xmath12 .",
    "here @xmath13 is the conditional probability of a measurement outcome @xmath6 given the phase was @xmath7 , and @xmath14 is the _ a priori _ probability distribution that characterizes our prior knowledge of the phase .",
    "the fidelity @xmath15 is a statistical characterization of the phase sensitivity of the interferometer that is valid when multiple peaks exist in @xmath16 .",
    "the fidelity is a measure of the quality of a sensor for given input state , and it applies to both classical and quantum interferometers . for a standard quantum mz interferometer with a phase shift @xmath7 in one arm  @xcite , with photon input into ports ",
    "a \" and  b \" , the measurement outcomes are @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the photon numbers output in port  c \" and  d \" .",
    "the phase probability distribution is obtained from bayes rule as @xmath20 where . in this report",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the fidelity of a mz interferometer on the _ a priori _ information available , @xmath14 , comparing fock state and n00n state input .",
    "the four phase probability distribution functions are shown for the measurement outcomes @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , for 3-photon n00n state input , @xmath25 , for @xmath26 . ]",
    "the four phase probability distribution functions are shown for the measurement outcomes @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , for 3-photon n00n state input , @xmath25 , for @xmath26 . ]",
    "the choice of input states is not intended to be optimum , but simply to compare two possible input states that are of current interest .",
    "for n - photon fock state input into arm  a \" and vacuum input into port  b \" , there are generally two peaks in the phase probability distribution @xmath27 , when @xmath26 .",
    "for the same @xmath26 with n - photon n00n ( maximally entangled ) state input , @xmath28 , there are generally four peaks in @xmath27  @xcite . for a single measurement ,",
    "when a given measurement outcome is obtained , eq.([phaseprobabiliydensity ] ) gives the probability distribution for the phase @xmath7 .",
    "when a 1-photon fock state is input into port  a \" , @xmath29 , the probabilities for photon output into ports  c \" and  d \" are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . when a 1-photon n00n state is input , @xmath32 , the probabilities for photon output in ports",
    " c \" and  d \" are @xmath33 ^ 2 /2 $ ] and @xmath34 ^ 2 / 2 $ ] , respectively .",
    "( it is curious to note that these probabilities , in this extreme quantum limit of 1-photon input , are equal to the classical probabilities for input of energy into only port  a \" , and input of equal energy into both ports  a \" and  b \" ( classical analog of n00n state input ) ) .    for 2-photon input ,",
    "there are three possible measurement outcomes . for 2-photon fock state input into port ",
    "a \" and vacuum in port  b \" , there are three probability density functions @xmath16 for the phase : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , for the measurement outcomes @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively , for @xmath26 . however , for the 2-photon n00n state input , the mz interferometer behaves as a beam splitter , where there is 1/2 probability that both photons come out port  c \" , 1/2 probability that both photons come out port  d \" , and zero probability that one photon comes out each port . for this case ,",
    "the probability of a given measurement outcome is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , the 2-photon n00n state can not be used for determining the phase .",
    "this is not the case with higher photon - number n00n state input .    in figures 1 and 2",
    ", we show the phase probability distributions for @xmath41 photon fock state and n00n state inputs , respectively , for @xmath26 .",
    "note that for n00n state input , the phase probability distributions are not symmetrical about @xmath42 and do not have simple peaks .",
    "as the number of input photons @xmath5 increase , the phase probability distributions get narrower .",
    "a gaussian fit to one peak of the probability distributions for fock state inputs of @xmath45 to @xmath46 photons indicates that the phase sensitivity is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath5 is the number of photons input into port  a \" .",
    "however , the n00n state phase probability distributions do not have localized peaks , see figure 2 , and hence it is not possible to estimate the phase sensitivity from such widths .",
    "consequently , we use the fidelity of the interferometer , given by eq .",
    "( [ mutualinformationeq ] ) , to compare the statistical phase sensitivity on average , for fock state input and for n00n state input . in previous work  @xcite , we computed the fidelity of a mz interferometer for the case of no prior information ( taking @xmath26 ) for fock state input and for n00n state input , and we found that the fidelity for fock state input is greater than or equal to that of n00n state input , for all input photon numbers  @xcite .    in the opposite regime , where we have very precise prior information , so @xmath14 has one narrow peak about some value @xmath48 , the fidelity can be approximated as @xmath49 ^ 2 } } { { p(m|\\phi _ 0 ) } } } \\right ] }   \\label{shannontightapriori}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52_{\\phi=\\phi_0}$ ] , and where we assumed that @xmath53 . in the limit of narrow distribution @xmath14",
    ", we find that the fidelity for fock state input and n00n state input is equal , @xmath54 , for given total number of input photons @xmath5 .",
    "( the exception to this statement is for n00n state input , with @xmath55 , when @xmath18 is odd , because then @xmath56 . ) from these results we see that in both limiting cases , where we have no prior information , and in the limit of narrow distribution for the prior information , the fidelities are equal , so the use of n00n states does not provide an advantage over fock states .",
    "finally , we compare the fidelity in the intermediate regime , for fock state and n00n state input , for the case when the prior information is given by a gaussian function @xmath57 $ ] , where the normalization @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 .",
    "see figures 3 and 4 .",
    "while there are small variations in fidelity for small photon numbers ( notably for @xmath45 and @xmath60 ) , we find that generally fock state input produces a higher fidelity than n00n state input . in figures 3 and 4 , we have chosen a prior information represented by a gaussian centered at @xmath61 . the result for @xmath62",
    "must be still be determined .",
    "finally , we note that in actual applications the prior information may have a complicated functional form with multiple maxima ."
