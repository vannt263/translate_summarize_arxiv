    "dna sequences , the blueprint of almost all essential genetic information , are polymers consisting of two complementary strands of four types of bases : adenine ( a ) , cytosine ( c ) , guanine ( g ) , and thymine ( t ) . among the four bases ,",
    "the presence of a on one strand is always paired with t on the opposite strand , forming a  base pair \" with 2 hydrogen bonds ; similarly , g and c are complementary to one another , while forming a base - pair with 3 hydrogen bonds @xcite .",
    "consequently , one may characterize at base - pairs as `` weak '' bases and gc base - pairs as `` strong '' bases .",
    "in addition , the frequency of a ( g ) on a single strand is approximately equal to the frequency of t ( c ) on the same strand , a phenomenon that has been termed  strand symmetry \" @xcite or  chargaff s second parity \" @xcite .",
    "therefore , dna sequences can be transformed into reduced 2-symbol sequences of weak w ( a or t ) and strong s ( g or c ) bases .",
    "the percentage of s ( g or c ) bases of a dna sequence segment is denoted as the gc base content ( gc% ) .",
    "the spatial variation of gc% along a dna sequence has been of long - standing interests @xcite .",
    "gc%-series can be considered as fluctuating or unsteady signals , and consequently many signal processing and stochastic analysis techniques can be applied to characterize and quantify the statistical properties of the dna sequences @xcite . in particular , spectral and",
    "correlation analyzes are standard tools that can be applied @xcite .",
    "initial spectral analysis @xcite provided evidence that dna sequences , especially non - protein - coding sequences , exhibit a power spectrum @xmath0 that can be approximated by @xmath6 ( @xmath2 ) and are termed  1/f noise \" ( or `` @xmath7 noise '' with @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 noise lies in - between the realm of white noise ( @xmath10 ) and brownian noise ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , and is indicative of a wide distribution of length scales ( or time , in the case of stochastic processes ) @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath7 spectra in many , but not all , short dna sequences ( of the order of a few thousands bases ) poses the question of whether @xmath7 spectra are a universal characteristic across all dna sequences .",
    "several lines of evidence show that the @xmath7 spectrum is indeed a generic phenomenon of gc% fluctuations in dna sequences and is found in genomic dna sequences from different taxonomic classes , including genomes from bacteria @xcite , yeast @xcite , insect @xcite , worm ( w li , unpublished data ) , and human @xcite .",
    "the human and mouse genomes are evolutionarily separated by about 65 - 75 million years , and they exhibit a high level of homology @xcite . yet several species - specific differences exist that might lead to different functional properties of @xmath0 :    * while the overall , genome - wide gc% of both human and mouse genomic dna sequences is about 42% , the distribution of gc% is different : gc% when measured in 20 kb ( @xmath12 bases ) windows in mouse genomic dna lacks extremely high and low gc% values @xcite .",
    "* there exist pronounced differences between large sequence segments ( of the order of several mb ( @xmath13 bases ) ) of human and mouse chromosomes due to chromosomal rearrangements . at such length scales ,",
    "gc% correlations existing in the human genome may be absent in mouse genome .",
    "this letter examines the presence of @xmath7 spectra in spatial gc% variations across all _ mus musculus _ chromosomes .",
    "a graphic display of the mouse genome gc% fluctuation can be found at @xcite .",
    "we download mouse genomic dna sequences for nineteen autosomal chromosomes ( chr1chr19 ) and two sex chromosomes ( chrx and chry ) from the ucsc genome bioinformatics site http://genome.ucsc.edu/ ( the october 2003 release , or ucsc version _ mm04 _ ) .",
    "all twenty - one chromosomes are evenly partitioned into @xmath14 non - overlapping windows of @xmath15 bases , and the gc% of each window is computed . a fraction of bases are yet uncharacterized and at these positions a",
    ", c , g , or t is substituted by the symbol ",
    "n \" ( sequence gaps ) .",
    "windows that contain only uncharacterized bases have an undetermined gc% value . in this study",
    ", we replace all undetermined gc% values by randomly chosen values from a normal distribution with gc% mean and variance taken from the empirical distribution of all determined gc% windows .",
    "higher eukaryotic genomes are enriched in repetitive sequences @xcite .",
    "repeats are approximate copies of dna sequence segments , and interspersed repeats are an abundant class of repetitive sequence segments in mammalian genomes that scattered throughout the genome . in both the human and the mouse genome , transposon - derived interspersed repeats constitute about 35 - 45%@xcite and 38% @xcite of the total genome , respectively . as can be seen from fig .  1 , the distribution of gc% for repetitive sequences is markedly different from that of the non - repetitive sequences . in order to study the effects of interspersed repeats , we use interspersed repeat - annotated versions of mouse chromosomes @xcite , and",
    "separately analyze gc% fluctuations obtained from dna sequences with retained and substituted interspersed repeats . in the latter dna sequences , we substitute gc% from interspersed repeats by randomly gc% values taken from a normal distribution with mean and variance taken from the empirical distribution of the non - repetitive proportion of each individual chromosome .      we coarse - grain sequences into a spatial - series of gc contents ( gc% ) and conduct spectral analysis of the spatial gc%-series . to this end , we chose a window of size @xmath15 bases , compute gc% , move the window along the dna sequence by @xmath16 bases , and iterate the computation to obtain a spatial - series of gc% values . non - overlapping windows are obtained by setting @xmath17 .    the power spectrum , the absolute squared average of the fourier transform , is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of windows .",
    "table  1 lists the window sizes and averaged gc% calculated at these window sizes for all chromosomes .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] window sizes ( @xmath15 ) and average gc contents ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "each mouse chromosome ( chr ) is partitioned into @xmath21 non - overlapping windows . [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we use the computational fast fourier transform ( fft ) , implemented in the s - plus statistical package ( version 3.4 , mathsoft , inc . ) .",
    "the s - plus subroutine spectrum takes as input a discrete fft to calculate as output a periodogram ( the power spectrum in units @xmath22 ) , and subsequently applies daniell - filtering ( i.e. rectangular window ) @xcite to compute a smoothed spectrum using a user - specified parameter value ( span ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the power spectrum @xmath0 as a function of the frequency @xmath23 across nineteen autosomal and two sex chromosomes .",
    "we find for sequences with retained interspersed repeats that @xmath0 exhibits the functional form @xmath24 persistently across twenty - one chromosomes .",
    "the exponent @xmath25 is close to @xmath26 1 for frequency ranges of @xmath27 cycle / base , corresponding to length scales @xmath28 of 100 kb @xmath29 10 mb . at higher frequencies",
    "@xmath4 cycle / base ( @xmath30  kb ) , @xmath0 generally becomes flattened with @xmath5 across all chromosomes .",
    "this deviation from the @xmath9 spectrum was also observed in human genome @xcite at lower frequencies @xmath31 cycle / base ( @xmath32  mb ) , there are much less spectral components , and hence @xmath0 shows relatively larger fluctuations , and the estimation of @xmath24 is less reliable . in the frequency range of @xmath33 cycle / base ,",
    "only @xmath0 for chr2 , chr4 , chr7 , chr11 and chr16 is indicative of a persistence of @xmath34 .    when we compute @xmath0 for mouse chromosomes @xmath35 and y with substituted interspersed repeats , we find that @xmath0 is higher than @xmath0 obtained for the original sequences , especially at frequency ranges higher than @xmath4 ( @xmath32  kb ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the substitution of gc% estimated from repetitive gc bases by random gc% values increases the level of white noise fluctuations at length scales comparable to lengths of interspersed repeats .",
    "it is interesting to note that the substitution of about 38% interspersed repeats hardly affects @xmath0 at intermediate and lower frequencies .",
    "a similar observation has been made for human genomic dna sequences @xcite .",
    "thus , interspersed repeats may not contribute predominantly to long - ranging correlations in mammalian genomic dna .",
    "before discussing the universal spectral shape of gc% of genomic dna sequences , note that not all spatial sequences or signals exhibit @xmath7 ( @xmath36 ) power spectra .",
    "an instructive example is provided by the spatial spectrum of images taken of natural scenes , where it is known that the _ amplitude spectrum _ of image pixels is typically @xmath9 , and consequently its power spectrum is @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "sometimes , the exponent @xmath25 in @xmath38 may not be exactly equal to 2 : for example , it was shown that underwater images tend to exhibit a larger exponent of @xmath25 ( or deeper slope ) than that of atmospheric images @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two theories of the @xmath39 scaling in such images : ( i ) it is caused by luminance edges , and ( ii ) it is caused by a power - law distribution of sizes of regions with constant intensity @xcite .",
    "experiments have been carried out to test whether images with a change of the slope @xmath25 can be detected visually by human objects @xcite .",
    "this well established @xmath39 spatial power spectrum in images provides a case example that spatial power spectra are not necessarily of the form @xmath40 .",
    "rather , @xmath40 and @xmath39 spectra are considered to belong to two different classes @xcite , and so the exponent @xmath2 observed in dna sequences is not _ a priori _ expected .",
    "one hypothesis is that @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) constitutes a universal property of all long dna sequences subject to neutral evolution that involved duplications and mutations @xcite . a simplified model , termed  expansion - modification ( em ) model \" @xcite generates a binary 2-symbol sequence by two local operations : ( i ) expansion / duplication : @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; and ( ii ) modification / mutation : @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "when the probability of the first operation is large ( e.g. probability @xmath45 ) , resulting binary sequences exhibit @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) power spectra .",
    "if the probability of the second operation ( @xmath46 ) is large , the resulting sequences exhibit white spectra ( @xmath47 ) @xcite . since the sequence generating process is hierarchical , it is implicit that the resulting sequence exhibit scale - invariance ( or perhaps multiple - scale - invariance @xcite ) .",
    "the em model contains two features that are essential for dna evolution : duplication and mutation .",
    "duplications , both inter - chromosomal or intra - chromosomal , expand dna sequences and provide a potential for genes to develop novel functions @xcite . in one point of view",
    ", duplications have a larger impact than natural selection in darwin s evolution theory , as duplications and the resulting redundancy actually created the foundation upon which natural selection acts @xcite .",
    "although point mutations might be detrimental to biological fitness , they neverthless provide a potential for evolution , perhaps on a smaller scale as compared to that for duplications .    a more realistic modeling of neutral evolution of dna sequences by duplication and mutation beyond the em model is still lacking @xcite , and",
    "so the hypothesis that all long dna sequences undergoing duplications and mutations exhibit @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) power spectra remains to be validated .",
    "the results presented in this paper , that _ mus musculus _",
    "genomic dna exhibits @xmath2 adds another line of evidence toward verification of this hypothesis .",
    "about 90% of the human and 93% of the mouse genome reside within syntenic blocks , in which the order of a series of biological markers ( e.g. genes ) are approximately conserved @xcite .",
    "however , with the exception of chrx , these syntenic blocks have different loci at human and mouse chromosomes .",
    "about 65 - 75 million years ago , the human genome and the mouse genome embarked on a different evolutionary history , with many chromosomal translocations , that left syntenic blocks of a human chromosome scattered on different mouse chromosomes .",
    "this basic picture indicates that the observation of @xmath9 spectra in the human genome @xcite will not guarantee similar spectra in mouse genome , as random translocations can easily destroy any long - range order a given dna sequence .",
    "an alternative explanation of @xmath9 spectra in the mouse genome , in light of observed @xmath9 spectra in human genome , is that both are in fact a consequence of the large - scale dynamics , such as translocation and duplication .",
    "theoretically , dna sequences frozen at about 65 - 75 million years ago before the divergence of human and mouse species could test this hypothesis .    besides translocation / duplication",
    ", mutations may also affect gc% fluctuations . if chromosomal segment translocations were the only process in the evolution , the human and mouse genomes ought to have the same gc content distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the gc% distribution in the mouse genome is tighter ( with smaller variance ) and lacks segments with higher gc% ( `` outliers '' ) as in the human genome , a fact both observed experimentally @xcite and by sequence analysis @xcite",
    ".    one might think that this difference of variances of the gc% distributions between the human and the mouse genome may render their spatial spectra different .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the exponent @xmath25 in @xmath7 is related to how the variance of gc% changes with the window size , instead of the variance itself ( and the isochore or fairly homogeneous sequence segment of about 200300 kb long or more @xcite is related to the asymmetry or the third moment of the gc% distribution ) .",
    "although variations in gc% are not of direct biological relevance , they are correlated with many other other measurements and biological functions of dna sequences , including chromosome bands , protein - coding gene density , replication timing , or recombination hot spots @xcite . if the correlation between gc% and a biological function is strong , then the scale - invariance pattern in gc% can be transformed into a similar spatial structure of these biologically functioning units .",
    "while a stretched out chromosome is too thin to be visible ( the diameter of a dna thread is about @xmath48 m @xcite ) , during the metaphase of a cell cycle it becomes visible because it is tightly packed into a chromatin structure ( with the length of a typical human chromosome of this compact form of about @xmath49 m @xcite ) .",
    "using giemsa dyes to stain chromosomes leads to alternating dark and light bands @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of this staining difference at different chromosomal regions is thought to be caused by the degree of condensation of the chromatin structure @xcite the connection between gc% and giemsa bands was long before suggested : giemsa - light bands ( termed r - bands ) are gc - rich , whereas giemsa - dark bands ( g - bands ) are gc - poor @xcite .",
    "this connection has been further calibrated , such that being _",
    "relatively _ gc - rich or gc - poor as compared to the flanking regions is correlated with giemsa - bands @xcite .",
    "this new proposal manages to reproduce chromosome bands quite well by sequence analysis @xcite .",
    "after the sequencing of the human genome has been completed , it was revealed that many long gc - poor regions contain a low gene density (  gene desert \" ) @xcite , confirming the earlier proposed correlation between gc% and gene density @xcite .",
    "in fact , the gene density not only increases with gc% , but increases faster than in a linear fashion @xcite .",
    "extremely gc - rich regions in the human genome are also extremely gene - rich , and beyond the gc content of gc% @xmath50 46% the gene - density increases markedly .",
    "due to the large genome size for most eukaryotic species , the replication of dna sequences starts at multiple positions .",
    "specific chromosome regions replicate earlier in time , while other regions replicate later , marked by a clear boundary between the two types of regions .",
    "while a correlation between replicating - timing and chromosome bands was proposed in @xcite ( r - band replicates earlier ) , the extent and biological relevance are still subject to investigation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , regions with high recombination rate ( recombination ot spots ) have been associated with being gc - rich @xcite . while this correlation has been established for yeast",
    "_ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ genome sequence @xcite , no conclusive result have yet been obtained for higher genomes such as human genomic dna @xcite .",
    "the general difficulty in the determination of regional recombination rates in human genome is that it is either indirect ( using pedigree analysis @xcite ) or limited to only male samples ( using sperm typing @xcite ) . even a newly proposed population genealogy - based inference of recombination rates @xcite is still not a direct measurement . in addition , it has also been proposed that recombination events increase the local gc content @xcite . while switching the role of cause and effect , from a statistical ( correlation ) point of view",
    ", the outcome remains the same .    instead of using the gc% as a `` surrogate '' , there also have been attempts to study large - scale patterns of biological units directly .",
    "it has been shown that in circular bacterial genome sequences , the positions and orientations of genes do not have any preferable length scale and are scale - invariant @xcite .",
    "this result should be directly linked to a similar scale - invariance of gc% in bacterial genomes .",
    "the universally observed @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) spectra in the mouse _",
    "mus musculus _ chromosomes , as well as in human chromosomes @xcite , motivates further sequence analysis on the spatial arrangement of functional biological units .",
