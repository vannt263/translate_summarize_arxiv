    "doped rare - earth manganites , also referred to as mixed - valence or colossal - magnetoresistive ( cmr ) manganites , have attracted a flurry of interest for decades @xcite .",
    "they are primarily of academic interest within the study of fundamental concepts in solid state physics addressing issues such as their multifaceted electronic / magnetic phase diagrams , their strong coupling between lattice , charge , spin , or orbital degrees of freedom , their sensitivity towards external fields , the high spin polarization in some compounds , or the occurrence of electronic phase separation in chemically homogeneous samples .",
    "while the technological value of bulk crystals seems to be limited , e.g. due to the low magnetic curie temperatures , thin films of selected compositions have the potential to play a role within tunable heterostructures in future all - oxide / all - perovskite electronic devices .",
    "the present work focuses on two of the younger aspects of manganite - compound research : the possibility of tetravalent - ion substitution in order to achieve effective electron - doping , e.g. for fabricating all - manganite diodes , and the behaviour under external optical excitation .    for the last two decades ,",
    "_ tetravalent - ion substituted _ rare - earth manganites ( with la@xmath4ce@xmath5mno@xmath2 being the most prominent among them ) have been discussed intensively as a potential electron - doped counterpart to the well - known divalent - ion substituted and thus hole - doped manganites .",
    "a summary of the debate , focusing on possible ( thin film ) preparation routes and the proof of an effective electron - doping , i.e. , a mixed mn@xmath6 valence , has been given in previous works @xcite .",
    "for instance , as a number of investigations have shown , as - prepared la@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lcemo ) films do not show their nominal mn valence of @xmath72.7 but are in fact hole - doped due to oxygen excess . on the other hand ,",
    "post - deposition oxygen reduction decreases the mn valence towards the nominal value but also leads to a pronounced resistance increase and the loss of the manganite - typical metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "interestingly , a decisive conductivity increase and the recovery of the mit can be induced by _ photoexcitation",
    "_ @xcite . however , the exact origin of these effects remained hidden to date .",
    "in very recent x - ray photoemission measurements , exploring the mn valence as a function of oxygen content and illumination intensity in variably thick lcemo films on srtio@xmath2 , evidence for the decisive role of photogenerated - charge injection from the substrate to the films was reported , but an additional manganite - intrinsic photoconductivity could not be completely excluded @xcite .",
    "this is one of the starting points where the present work sets in .",
    "compared to the number of investigations reflecting on the tunability of the manganites conductivity and other physical properties by doping , magnetic or strain fields , studies of _ the effects of photonic excitations on manganites _ are still a quite small research field . for a further discussion",
    "we define the photoresistance @xmath8 as follows :    @xmath9    with @xmath10 being the sample resistance in the dark , and @xmath11 being the resistance under light excitation .",
    "thus a decrease of the resistance under illumination results in a _ positive _ pr , i.e. , an appreciable _",
    "photoconductivity_.    a survey of the previous literature is given in @xcite .",
    "in short , after the first discovery of photoconducticity in a mixed - valence manganite , namely in a pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 single crystal @xcite , a number of single - crystalline as well as thin - film manganite compounds were studied under various photoexcitation conditions , and a plenty of effects were reported . a general coherent microscopic picture of the photoresponse is still lacking to date .",
    "roughly , the effects belong to one of the four following groups :    * photonic excitation of electrons from the valence to the conduction band @xcite , * photoinduced demagnetization @xcite , * disturbance of charge and orbital order in insulating charge ordered manganites by photoelectrons @xcite , and * injection of photogenerated charge carriers from the substrate into the thin - film channel @xcite .",
    "the last of these four mechanisms naturally occurs in thin films only ; but there it plays a major and possibly technologically interesting role . in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 films on srtio@xmath2 , which were illuminated with a broad - band white - light source and exhibited a _ negative _ pr , katsu et al",
    ". concluded an injection of optically generated electrons from the srtio@xmath2 substrate into the hole - doped film followed by the recombination of both carrier types within the film leading to a resistance increase @xcite .",
    "in our two previous works , where we observed _ positive _ pr in la@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath12 @xcite and la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath12 @xcite films on srtio@xmath2 , we gave a similar interpretation . by the comparative evaluation of the wavelength dependence of the pr and the surface photovoltage",
    "we had concluded that at least part of the photogenerated carriers must stem from interband transitions in the substrate or from carrier excitation from interface states , the latter explaining the pr below the srtio@xmath2 band gap energy , and not solely from the manganite film .",
    "however , these investigations were limited to a single film with a thickness of 10  nm only .",
    "thus , the present experiments were planned and conducted purposely to clarify the microscopic scenario of the phototransport in ce - doped manganite thin films employing a broader set of films .    extended resistance - vs .- temperature ( _ r - t _ ) data of the films under different illumination conditions was acquired in order to systematically analyse the influence of film thickness , oxygen content , and degree of phase separation on ( i ) the dark transport , which is reported in a separate paper @xcite , and ( ii ) the phototransport , which is discussed in section  [ sec_r_t ] .    moreover , due to the well - known strong coupling of magnetic order and electronic transport in the manganites it appeared to be indispensable to study the magnetotransport under illumination for a further understanding of the microscopic nature of the observed photoconductivity .",
    "the corresponding magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements and results for selected samples are presented in section  [ sec_mr_exp ] .    finally , the lcemo film exhibiting the strongest disorder showed ( apart from its photoconductivity ) a rather unexpected electroresistive effect . there ,",
    "magnetoresistance measurements were employed to understand this ( side ) effect as well .",
    "three different lcemo films were grown by pulsed laser deposition on srtio@xmath2 ( 100 ) single crystal substrates .",
    "details on growth and structural analysis can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "samples b and c were grown under the same oxygen partial pressure of p(o@xmath3)@xmath130.25  mbar but are different in thickness ( 30  nm vs. 100  nm ) , while samples c and d have the same thickness but d was grown under a decisively lower oxygen pressure , which led to microscopic segregation of ceo@xmath3 clusters .",
    "thus , the comparison of b and c provides information on the thickness dependence of the films photoresponse , and contrasting c and d is supposed to give comparative insight to the pcs dependence on the degree of phase segregation .    to separate the influence of the oxygen stoichiometry from any of the above parameters ,",
    "each sample was studied at three different states of oxygen reduction , which were prepared by heating in a low - pressure oxygen atmosphere ( see table  [ tab_2 ] ) .    for reference measurements of the magnetoresistance ,",

    "v , all samples exhibit an insulating behaviour in the whole investigated temperature range and no clear mit . similarly to the slightly reduced films , illumination leads to a significant decrease of the resistance at low temperatures , but makes no effect at 300  k. different to the case of the slightly reduced films [ cf .",
    "figure  [ fig2](a ) ] which exhibit moderate pr values up to 120  % , the pr at 80  k shows dramatically high values already for longer wavelengths , see figure  [ fig2](b ) . below 395  nm ( b , c ) and 385  nm ( d )",
    "the pr increases even more strongly with decreasing wavelength .",
    "remarkably , the pr of the thinner ( 30  nm ) film b is higher than the pr of the thicker ( 100  nm ) film c. assuming an intrinsic charge carrier generation in the film , one would expect the opposite to happen , since the thicker film must absorb more light and thus exhibit the larger pr . if charge carrier injection from the substrate is the dominating process , the thinner film should , as indeed observed here , have the higher pr , since it passes more photons to the substrate .",
    "thus , at a first glance , the current observation points towards the charge injection scenario postulated before in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand , regarding the case of the slightly reduced films , the pr of the thinner film  b is _ lower _ than the pr of the thicker films c and d [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , again ] .",
    "it is conceivable , that both processes , intrinsic carrier generation in the lcemo and injection of photogenerated carrier from the substrate coexist , but with different weight depending on the degree of oxygen reduction .",
    "current - voltage characteristics of the highly reduced sample d at 80  k ( a ) and at 300  k ( b).,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    interestingly , the resistance of film d strongly depends on the measuring voltage . as visible in figure  [ fig3](d ) , the resistance at 5  v is at least one order of magnitude lower than at 1  v [ figure  [ fig3](c ) ] over the whole temperature range investigated here .",
    "furthermore , at 5  v , an mit appears at 135  k , whose transition temperature rises under illumination . indeed ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , the current - voltage characteristics of the highly reduced sample d is highly nonlinear and asymmetric at 300  k as well as at 80  k , which points towards an enhanced inhomogeneity of the film .",
    "we note that the corresponding i - v curves of samples b and c ( not shown here ) exhibit a linear shape at 300  k and nonlinear asymetric shapes at 80  k , but the latter with very low currents in the pa range , which limits their significance .      due to the well - known strong interplay between charge transport and magnetic order in the mixed - valence manganites , we performed systematic measurements of the magnetoresistance as a function of magnetic field and temperature in order to achieve a profound understanding of the effect of illumination and measuring voltage on the charge transport in the _ highly reduced _ lcemo samples .",
    "thus , an extended temperature range between 5  k and 300  k was studied using a liquid - helium cryostat for the following selected samples :    * the _ highly reduced sample c _ was measured in order to clarify the origin of the photoconductivity and the photoinduced mit . * the _ highly reduced sample d",
    "_ was studied in order to clarify the origin of the electrical - field - induced mit .",
    "since the interpretation of those results turned out to be complex and the electroresistance is more a side effect within the present study , we have exported the information and discussion for this sample into the supplement . * the _ as - prepared sample c _ and a _ reduced bare srtio@xmath2 _ single crystal were chosen for reference measurements .",
    "prior to presenting our experimental findings , we briefly recall the necessary background needed to evaluate the mr data :    in the literature on the cmr effect , the following definition of the @xmath23 is frequently used :    @xmath24    in mixed - valent manganites , the resistance at zero field @xmath25 is larger than the resistance in an external magnetic field @xmath26 ( negative mr ) .",
    "then the above definition gives values between -1 and 0 .",
    "a quantitative model describing the field dependence of the mr is given by wagner et al . @xcite . here ,",

    "while formerly the coexistence of ( i ) photogenerated carriers within the the lcemo films and ( ii ) carriers injected from the substrate or from interface states was proposed to be the origin for the _ r - t _ characteristics under illumination , the observation of _ positive _ magnetoresistance under illumination for both the lcemo / srtio@xmath2 heterostructures and a bare srtio@xmath2 single crystal strongly points towards a third ( coexisting ) mechanism influencing the measured resistance behaviour : parallel photoconduction in the substrate .",
    "unexpectedly , the highly reduced lcemo film with the strongest ceo@xmath3 phase segregation showed an electrical - field induced mit , which could , however , after the evaluation of the magnetoresistance behaviour , be ascribed to the charge transport in the srtio@xmath2 substrate , too .    finally , we conclude that the role of the srtio@xmath2 substrate in previous studies of the photoinduced properties of manganite thin films , e.g. , refs .",

    "<S> la@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath2 thin films of different thicknesses , degrees of ceo@xmath3-phase segregation and oxygen deficiency , grown on srtio@xmath2 single crystal substrates , were comparatively investigated with respect to both their spectral and temperature - dependent photoconductivity ( pc ) and their magnetoresistance ( mr ) behaviour under photoexcitation . while as - grown films were insensitive to optical excitation , oxygen reduction appeared to be an effective way to decrease the film resistance , but the film thickness was found to play a minor role . however , from the evaluation of the spectral behaviour of the pc and the comparison of the mr of the lcemo / substrate - samples with a bare substrate under illumination we find that the photoconductivity data reflects not only contributions from ( i ) photogenerated charge carriers in the film and ( ii ) carriers injected from the photoconductive substrate ( as concluded from earlier works ) , but also ( iii ) a decisive parallel photoconduction in the srtio@xmath2 substrate . furthermore  also by analyzing the mr characteristics  the unexpected occurence of a strong electroresistive effect in the sample with the highest degree of ceo@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> segregation and oxygen deficiency could be attributed to the electroresistance of the srtio@xmath2 substrate as well . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest a critical reconsideration and possibly a reinterpretation of several previous photoconductivity and electroresistance investigations of manganite thin films on srtio@xmath2 . </S>"
