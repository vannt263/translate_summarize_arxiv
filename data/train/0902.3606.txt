    "to calculate cross sections for hadronic particles it is important to understand the evolution in the initial state . in a high energy collision ,",
    "each of the two incoming particles will emit gluons before meeting and interacting .",
    "enumerate the possible initial states with @xmath5 and give each state a probability @xmath6 such that @xmath7 . with a scattering probability @xmath8 between state @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "the total interaction probability can be expressed as @xmath11 that means that the expectation value of @xmath8 , weighted by @xmath6 can be measured .",
    "similarly the diffractive , including elastic , cross section is @xmath12 to get both these cross sections right , not only the expectation value of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath6 is required , but also the fluctuations .",
    "that is , it is possible to measure if the cross section is dominated by frequently occuring states with a low interaction probability , giving a low @xmath13 , or by rare states with a high interaction probability , giving a high @xmath13 . also the elastic interaction probability can be written in this way as @xmath14 this makes the form of the impact parameter profile important since the more spread out the interaction probability is , the smaller the elastic cross section will be .",
    "these arguments show that to describe all the above cross sections , it is important to have a good description of the fluctuations , both in @xmath15 and @xmath6 .",
    "our model uses colour dipoles in impact parameter space , based on the model by mueller @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons to do the calculations in impact parameter space is that each emission is on a shorter timescale than the previous ones , essentially freezing their transverse position .",
    "each incoming particle is represented by a dipole state ( for example the photon is represented as a single dipole ) , which is then evolved in rapidity before colliding .",
    "the evolution is equivalent to leading order bfkl , and we have made corrections for higher order effects .",
    "each dipole is emitting gluons , forming two new dipoles with a probability density of @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the transverse positions of the partons in the original dipole , while @xmath19 is the position of the emitted gluon .",
    "@xmath20 is the size of the smallest of the three involved dipoles ( the original one , and the two new ones ) , and is setting the scale for the * running coupling constant * for the emission .",
    "also * confinement * is included in this emission density , which takes form in the modified bessel functions @xmath21 which fall off exponentially for large arguments .",
    "the confinement scale is set by @xmath22 , corresponding to a gluon mass @xmath23 in a screened yukawa potential .",
    "* energy conservation * is accounted for by approximating the @xmath24 of the partons as twice the inverse dipole size , from which @xmath25 can be calculated .",
    "allowing only emissions that respect energy - momentum conservation gives a cutoff for emitting too small dipoles , that is , too large @xmath24 , cutting away the poles in the emission probability ( [ eq : emprob ] ) .",
    "apart from the 1 to 2 emission above , the model also includes a 2 to 2 dipole swing , where dipoles of the same colour may recombine , changing the colour flow , but not the momenta .",
    "the swing favours small dipoles over large dipoles , which reduces the cross section and gives a * saturation * effect .      to find the cross section ,",
    "the interaction probability of two evolved states of dipoles is calculated for a given impact parameter .",
    "the probability that a dipole @xmath9 from one state will interact with a dipole @xmath10 in the other state is @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 the transverse positions of the partons of dipole @xmath9 .",
    "this is then corrected for confinement , which introduces bessel functions as was done for the emission probability ( [ eq : emprob ] ) . using this",
    ", the total interaction probability of the two dipole states can be calculated in the * unitarised * form , @xmath29 this is again using the fact that the interactions are taking place during a short timescale , freezing the transverse positions of the partons .",
    "this evolution and interaction can be simulated in a monte carlo program to determine the interaction probability numerically . integrating over the impact parameter",
    "then gives the total cross section , and modifications to the order of integration as in section [ sec : why ] yields diffractive and elastic cross sections .",
    "by tuning the two evolution parameters @xmath30 and @xmath22 and the proton wavefunction we can describe the total and elastic @xmath3 cross section ( fig [ fig : pp ] ) . the tuned proton wavefunction is an equilateral triangle of dipoles with a radius of 3  gev@xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that once the cross section is tuned for a total and elastic cross section at a given energy , the energy dependence of the cross sections depends very weakly on the tuning , so it is a direct result of the evolution in our model .",
    "the fourier transform of the elastic amplitude then gives also @xmath32 . as the elastic amplitude is calculated through the optical theorem ,",
    "only the imaginary part is included , which causes a dip to 0 amplitude at a certain @xmath33 . with",
    "the real part included , this dip would be smoothed out . the fact that it is possible to describe the energy dependence of the cross sections , as well as following @xmath32 over many orders of magnitude is a sign of the predictive power of the model",

    "the wavefunction can be calculated perturbatively and the cross section as function of @xmath4 and @xmath34 is predicted directly from the @xmath3 tuning .",
    "the results agree with data ( dotted line in fig [ fig : pg ] ) , showing that the model can predict data without being tuned to it .         for low @xmath4 ( below 5 - 10  gev@xmath35 ) the photon wavefunction will have important soft contributions .",
    "confinement suppresses too large dipoles , which can be taken into account by shrinking large dipoles coming out from the perturbative wavefunction .",
    "this can be compared to the confinement used in the evolution and can be estimated using the confinement scale @xmath22 from the evolution .",
    "the most important effect is when the quark - antiquark pair propagates as a vector meson , boosting the wavefunction at mesonic dipole sizes .",
    "this vector meson resonance is not well understood quantitatively , so it had to be parametrised and tuned to low @xmath4 total @xmath1 cross section data .",
    "the result with both soft effects included in the photon wavefunction is shown in the full line in fig [ fig : pg ] .    once the photon wavefunction was determined , also for low @xmath4 , the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) cross section can be calculated , using a @xmath36 photon wavefunction for the outgoing particle .",

    "the vector meson wavefunction can not be calculated perturbatively , but there are several models that estimate it , using normalisation and decay width to fix parametrisations .",
    "we used the dgkp @xcite and the boosted gaussian @xcite models in our calculations . for the light vector mesons , the @xmath4 and @xmath34 dependence on the total cross section agrees well with data , specially for the boosted gaussian model ( fig [ fig : rho ] ) .",
    "also the @xmath33 dependence agrees for high @xmath4 , while for lower @xmath4 , the slope is too steep .",
    "this is not surprising , as the vector meson dominance of the photon wavefunction dominates in this range .",
    "it was tuned only to the total cross section in @xmath1 , and we can not expect this parametrisation to correctly describe also the impact parameter profile that determines the @xmath33 dependence .",
    "possibly , this is also the case in dvcs , but since the available experimental data for @xmath33 dependence does not go below q@xmath38 8  gev@xmath35 , it is not observed .",

    "one source of uncertainty is the vector meson resonance correction to the photon wavefunction , which would have to be retuned for a charm pair fluctuating into a @xmath39 .",
    "more work is needed to achieve reliable results for heavy quark vector mesons .",
    "our dipole model has proven to describe a wide selection of data in both @xmath3 and in @xmath1 collisions .",

    "there are soft effects in the photon wave functions that we do not understand quantitatively , mainly the vector meson resonance .",
    "looking forward , we are currently working on using the information in the evolved states to determine not only the cross section , but also the exclusive final state .",
    "the evolution gives us the particles , their momenta , and even their colour connections .",
