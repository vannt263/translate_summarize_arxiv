    "einstein @xcite pointed out in 1905 that the lorentz force in electromagnetic fields can be deduced naturally from the self - evident force on a charge at rest in an electric field with his theory of special relativity .",
    "he has thereby provided a firm logical ground on the magnetic part of causing a deflection . however , this force is absent in the modern theoretical accomplishments of superconductivity , i.e.  the standard ginzburg - landau equations @xcite and the quasiclassical eilenberger equations @xcite derived microscopically from the gorkov equations.@xcite thus , our understanding on the magnetic lorentz force in superconductors has remained at a somewhat phenomenological level .",
    "we here wish to make an improvement on this fundamental issue , focusing our attention on equilibrium cases .",
    "london @xcite included the lorentz force as a necessary ingredient in his phenomenological equations of superconductivity .",
    "they predict that an equilibrium supercurrent @xmath3 in a magnetic field @xmath4 accompanies an electric field : @xmath5 with @xmath6 as the electron mass , @xmath7 @xmath8 as the charge , @xmath9 as the superfluid velocity , @xmath10 as the superfluid density , and @xmath11 as the light velocity .",
    "the second equality results from the london equation @xmath12 with the condition @xmath13 .",
    "the expression implies that one could estimate the superfluid density @xmath10 through the hall coefficient @xmath14 , which would diverge towards the transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , van vijfeijken and staas @xcite presented phenomenological two - fluid equations with the lorentz force , which modify eq .",
    "( [ e - p1 ] ) into @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron density .",
    "thus , the hall coefficient is predicted to stay constant up to @xmath2 contrary to the london theory .",
    "these considerations with the free - electron dispersion were extended by adkins and waldram @xcite to incorporate the electronic band structure from a somewhat different context of the bernoulli potential , with no explicit connection to the lorentz force .",
    "specifically , they considered how a uniform supercurrent at @xmath17 modifies the cooper pairing of non - spherical fermi surfaces to present an expression of the hall coefficient , which can take either sign just as the one of the normal state .",
    "hong @xcite and omelyanchuk and beloborodko @xcite later performed microscopic calculations of the equilibrium electric field due to an almost uniform supercurrent , also with no direct relevance to the lorentz force . using the gorkov equations with the free - electron density of states",
    ", they obtained an expression in favor of eq .",
    "( [ e - p2 ] ) together with an additional term .",
    "however , all the finite - temperature effects in their derivations originate from the subtle energy dependence of the free - electron density of states , so that they might be deduced to vanish for a constant density - of - states near the fermi level .",
    "it should be noted finally that no investigations seem to have been carried out for the cases of anisotropic pairings .    pioneered by onnes and hof in 1914 , efforts have also been made to detect an equilibrium / quasi - equilibrium hall voltage of superconductors.@xcite one can show with eq .",

    "for the experimental setup . however , early experiments @xcite observed null hall voltage contrary to the theoretical predictions .",
    "hunt @xcite and nozires and vinen @xcite later pointed out independently that voltmeters used in those experiments , which require direct contacts to the sample , are not appropriate to detect the electrostatic potential .",
    "indeed , voltmeters can only pick out the chemical - potential difference , but the chemical potential is constant in equilibrium throughout the sample .",
    "the difficulty was circumvented successively by applying capacitive couplings to the specimen.@xcite bok and klein @xcite performed a low - temperature measurement of the hall voltage with pb as well as nb and pbin below @xmath24 to obtain a good agreement of their results with eq .",

    "especially , no experiments seem to have been carried out on materials with anisotropic energy gaps such as high-@xmath2 superconductors where new physics may be expected .",
    "it was shown recently that the lorentz force can be incorporated appropriately into the quasiclassical equations of superconductivity starting from the gorkov equations in the keldysh formalism.@xcite the key procedures were : ( i ) an extension of the gauge - invariant wigner transformation introduced by stratonovich @xcite and fujita @xcite for the normal state to the nambu green s function ; and ( ii ) a derivation of the corresponding groenewold - moyal product@xcite for performing the gradient expansion .",
    "they have successfully removed the imperfect gauge invariance in a couple of preceding treatments.@xcite the resulting equations can describe both the equilibrium and dynamical behaviors of superconductors with the lorentz force such that the normal - state boltzmann equation is included appropriately as a limit . using them ,",
