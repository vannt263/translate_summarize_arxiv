    "soft , i.e. , small angle , pion - pion scattering at moderate energies above the prominent resonances falls into the domain of the regge theory . in the soft region",
    "the scattering amplitudes fall rapidly with @xmath5 because of the form factor effects .",
    "large - angle , hard , scattering will eventually be dominated by pqcd mechanisms .    at low and resonance energies one of important sources on @xmath0 scattering",
    "is the extraction of the pion exchange contribution to @xmath17 ( see e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there is only very limited information on @xmath18 scattering above resonances . here",
    "the information about the @xmath18 total cross section comes from the absorption model analysis of the experimental data on @xmath4 reactions @xcite .",
    "there are no direct experimental data on hard @xmath0 scattering which is of special interest within pqcd . at low @xmath5 the @xmath19-dependence of the scattering amplitude",
    "is controlled by the size of the beam and target hadrons .",
    "for instance , within the glauber - gribov multiple scattering theory of composite objects , the impulse approximation amplitude is proportional to the product of one - body form factors of the beam and target @xcite . within the same multiple scattering theory , elastic scattering of the @xmath20-body beam on the @xmath20-body target receives the special contribution form the n - fold rescattering in which different constituents of the beam scatter off different constituents of the target .",
    "this special contribution does not depend on the size of the beam and target , i.e. is free of the form factor suppression . in the realm of pqcd",
    "such a three - gluon exchange mechanism of @xmath21 scattering has been discussed by landshoff @xcite . in scattering of the two - body pions",
    "the related glauber - gribov - landshoff ( ggl ) mechanism emerges already at the level of the two - gluon exchange , i.e. , in the born term for the pqcd hard pomeron exchange . for this reason",
    ", one can expect a precocious dominance of the ggl mechanism in hard @xmath22 scattering .    in this communication",
    "we discuss the onset of the dominance of the ggl mechanism in @xmath0 scattering at @xmath23 10 gev .",
    "such an analysis requires an understanding of the large-@xmath5 tail of soft elastic scattering , which we evaluate within the regge absorption models .",
    "the glauber - gribov arguments for the absence of the form factor suppression of the ggl amplitude were implicitly based on the nonrelativistic ( nr ) approximation for composite systems .",
    "we find that in contrast to nr approximation , in the light - cone approach there is a residual , albeit weak , form factor suppression of the ggl amplitude .",
    "although the direct experimental study of hard @xmath0 elastic scattering is not feasible , this process can contribute via final state interaction to hard charge exchange reaction @xmath24 which has been observed experimentally @xcite with the cross section much larger than perturbative qcd quark - exchange predictions @xcite .",
    "new , preliminary data from delphi @xcite suggest even stronger excess with respect to pqcd .",
    "our interest in hard @xmath0 scattering has been motivated by this missing strength of pqcd predictions , because soft @xmath25 process followed by hard @xmath0 elastic scattering could account for the missing strength .",
    "the presentation of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with the evaluation of the pqcd 2 g exchange amplitude in section 2 . in section 3 , assuming regge factorization , we derive parameters of soft @xmath18 scattering , based on experimental data for @xmath3 and @xmath26 scattering .",
    "the role of multiple soft and hard rescatterings on angular distributions of pions is discussed in section 4 .",
    "let us start with evaluation of the pqcd two - gluon contribution to the elastic pion - pion scattering .",
    "we treat the pion as the quark - antiquark state .",
    "the relevant pqcd diagrams which contribute to the pion impact factor are shown in fig.[fig_gluon ] .",
    "a calculation of born amplitudes in the non - relativistic approximation for the target and beam hadrons can be found elsewhere @xcite . in the present communication",
    "we use both nonrelativistic and the light - cone description of the pion .    making use of the sudakov technique @xcite , one readily obtains the impact factor representation of the pion - pion scattering amplitude @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the exchanged - gluon momenta , which are purely transverse , 2/9 is the qcd color factor for the @xmath0 scattering process considered and @xmath29 is the qcd strong charge",

    "we observe a huge difference between the opposite - sign and same - sign pion - pion scattering for the ( soft@xmath76soft component , which is caused by a substantial contribution from the secondary reggeon exchange .",
    "this difference is further illustrated in fig.[fig_im_a ] , where we present for the decomposition of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic @xmath77 scattering ( left panel ) and the same - sign pion scattering ( right panel ) at w = 4 gev ( solid lines ) into single- ( dash - dotted line ) and double - scattering contributions ( dashed line ) terms .",
    "a destructive interference of the single- and double - scattering contributions is much weaker for the same - sign pions than for the opposite - sign pions .",
    "this property is also seen in the table 2 , where we show the total elastic cross section calculated for several energies in the regge impulse approximation without , @xmath78 , and including , @xmath79 , absorption corrections ( we notice in passing that the effect of the pqcd 2g - exchange on total elastic cross section is marginal and does not exceed 10 per cent ) .",
    "the two evaluations do practically coincide for the same - sign pions , but for the opposite - sign pions the effect of absorption on elastic cross section is strong .",
    "that will lead to a pronounced difference for the corresponding cross sections in the soft - hard interference region of intermediate @xmath5 .    in fig.[fig_1st_2nd ]",
    "we show the decomposition of the differential cross sections of elastic scattering ( solid line ) into the contributions of single- , including both the sift and 2 g exchange contributions , and double - scattering terms , shown by the dashed and dotted lines , respectively ( the interference term is not shown ) .",
    "one observes quite a different pattern of destructive interference of single- and double - scattering for the opposite - sign ( left panel ) and the same - sign ( right panel ) pion - pion scattering .",
    "the diffractive dips for the opposite - sign pion - pion scattering occur at values of @xmath19 at which the contributions to differential cross section from single- ( dashed line ) and double - scattering ( dotted line ) are about identical . whereas the origin of different diffractive structures for the same - sign and opposite - sign pions is clear and the onset of pqcd hard regime in the same - sign pion scattering is substantiated by this analysis",
    ", one must conclude that model - dependence of the double - scattering amplitude makes the large-@xmath5 results and the dip positions for the opposite - sign case numerically unstable .",
    "this point is corroborated by the energy dependence of differential cross section shown in fig.[fig_diff_energies ] : while for the same - sign pions ( the right panel ) it is very weak in accordance to the small contribution from secondary reggeons to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude , for the opposite - sign @xmath77 case ( the left panel ) the substantial energy dependence of the secondary reggeon contribution entail very strong energy dependence at large-@xmath19 . only at very large @xmath80 4",
    "gev@xmath70 the @xmath77 indicates an onset of weak energy dependence . this masking effect of subleading reggeon exchanges persists up to rather high @xmath81 10 - 20 gev .",
    "the above shown results were for the exponential reggeon - pion vertices with @xmath82 gev@xmath83 .",
    "the sensitivity of the forward diffraction peak to the parameterization of the reggeon - pion vertices is shown in fig.[fig_eff_slope ] , where we plot the effective diffraction slope @xmath84 for the @xmath77 scattering .",
    "these plots demonstrate clearly a substantial enhancement of the diffraction slope by absorption corrections : systematically @xmath85 , see also the results for the diffraction slope shown in table 2 .",
    "notice the rise of @xmath86 with increasing @xmath5 for the exponential parameterization , which is driven by destructive interference of the single- and double - scattering amplitudes ( the same trend is obvious from the convex shape of the @xmath77 differential cross section in fig .",
    "10 ) . on the other hand , the diffraction slope obtained with the monopole parameterization for the reggeon - pion vertex decreases with rising @xmath5 in close semblance to what has been observed experimentally in the proton - proton and pion - proton scattering @xcite .",
    "still , at large @xmath5 the monopole form factor gives a soft amplitude which does not vanish much faster than pqcd asymptotic predictions @xcite and , consequently , should not be applied beyond the small @xmath19 region .",
    "this shows that there is no simple one - parameter functional form which would be preferable for both small and large @xmath5 .",
    "in the present analysis we have explored the onset of pqcd hard mechanism for elastic pion - pion scattering in the region of intermediate energies w = 3 - 5 gev .",
    "the glauber - gribov - landshoff mechanism is shown to dominate hard two - gluon scattering at large @xmath5 .",
    "we have shown that while in the non - relativistic approximation for the pion the ggl amplitude is free of the form factor suppression at large @xmath5 , this is not so in the relativistic lightcone approach .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between the transverse and longitudinal motion of quarks inherent to the lightcone treatment makes the ggl amplitude free of the end - point contributions .",
    "assuming dominance of soft physics and regge factorization at small @xmath5 we have predicted the total cross section for pion - pion scattering consistent with experimental values extracted in the literature .",
    "we analysed the impact of large-@xmath5 tail of soft hadronic scattering on the onset of pqcd hard mechanism . within the conventional regge",
    "absorption models , there emerges a rather complex interplay of soft - hard interference . specifically , pqcd hard scattering is found to dominate elastic scattering of the same sign pions at @xmath873 gev@xmath70 .",
    "however , in the case of the opposite - sign pions the destructive soft - hard interference remains strong up to at least @xmath874 gev@xmath70 .",
    "the effects discussed here are important in the context of a recently reported deficit of pqcd result at large - angle scattering in @xmath88 as compared to the experimental data measured at electron - positron colliders .",
