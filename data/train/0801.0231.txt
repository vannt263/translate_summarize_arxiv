    "the flavor diversity in the electroweak interaction continues to attract theoretical curiosity for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "pioneer work of ref.@xcite has shown a natural mechanism to suppress the unwanted neutral flavor changing process mediated by the higgs exchange .",
    "recent activities address the general structure of the minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) @xcite .",
    "it is noticed that octet - colored scalars are able to respect mfv .",
    "the general yukawa interaction is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 refers to the three families of left - handed quark doublets , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 the three families of the up - type and down - type right - handed quark singlets .",
    "the new set of octet - colored scalars @xmath4 and @xmath5 couple to quarks in an analogous fashion of the usual higgs @xmath6 and @xmath7 by the yukawa coupling matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 with additional proportional coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as well as the color generator @xmath12 .",
    "all higgs bosons @xmath13 and @xmath14 carry the weak hypercharge @xmath15 , in the convention @xmath16 .",
    "the usual conjugation operation @xmath17 is adopted .",
    "all interactions respect a @xmath18-symmetry , in which down - type fields @xmath7 , @xmath5 , @xmath19 are odd , @xmath20 , but up - type fields @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath21 are even .",
    "the symmetry is used to keep the desirable pattern of interaction that obeys the rule of the minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 can produce cp violating vertices for the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron .",
    "however the neutron edm is masked with uncertainty of the hadronic matrix evaluations .",
    "it is interesting to ask the question of any contribution to the electron edm , reached by ongoing and future experiments@xcite .",
    "it turns out that one - loop or two - loop contributions to the electron edm are absent if there is only one octet - colored scalar electroweak doublet .",
    "nonetheless , in this article we show that with two of these octet - colored scalars , the electron edm occurs through an amplitude @xmath22 of the pseudoscalar neutral higgs boson @xmath23 into a pair of octet - colored charged scalars .",
    "then , a cp even amplitude for @xmath24 appear even though @xmath23 is cp - odd . as @xmath23 and one of the photon touch down to an electron line ,",
    "the electron edm emerges via barr - zee@xcite mechanism in an overall two - loop diagram , as shown in fig .  1 .        in the past",
    ", the electron edm via barr - zee two - loop mechanism has been exhaustively studied in scenarios of multi - higgs doublets@xcite ( without octet - colored scalars ) or supersymmetric particles@xcite .",
    "our current study uses similar bosonic contribution as in @xcite .",
    "we have found that the present limit of the electron edm has already restricted the parameter space of cp violation of the octet - colored scalars .",
    "as we know that if a cp - odd scalar couples to a conjugated pair of bosons , cp conservation is violated , just like the case in @xmath26 .",
    "we are going to find such a coupling in the mfv scenario with two colorless doublet higgs @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and two octet - colored higgs @xmath4 , @xmath5 . rotating the basis of colorless higgs , @xmath27",
    "we achieve that @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "the relevant vertices , allowed by the exact @xmath30 , are @xmath31 we start with the first term @xmath32 we single out the pseudoscalar higgs @xmath23 from im(@xmath33 ) , or @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 including the @xmath38 coupling , we combine results and obtain @xmath39 now we look at the charged components of the color octets .",
    "the light and heavy mass states @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by the diagonalization of the mass matrix @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are real , and the complex off - diagonal mass squared @xmath45 , @xmath46 we can absorb the phase @xmath47 of latexmath:[$(\\eta'-\\eta ) \\equiv",
    "@xmath25 coupling matrix becomes real and antisymmetric , but the remaining phase @xmath49 in the off - diagonal mass squared is genuine and not removable .",
    "the unitary diagonalization transformation is usually complex , @xmath50 where the @xmath51 unitary matrix is denoted as @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 note that diagonal entries arise due to the cp violating phase @xmath54 .",
    "traceless is a consistent check .",
    "we denote @xmath55 .",
    "the relevant diagonal @xmath25 interaction becomes @xmath56 the interaction can produce the electron edm via barr - zee mechanism with the charged octet higgs @xmath57 in the inner loop .",
    "also note that if masses of eigenstates @xmath40 and @xmath41 become equal , the cp violating effect disappears .",
    "other quartic couplings not given in eq.([quartics ] ) do not generate the interaction between @xmath23 and the @xmath57 pair .    as the neutral pseudoscalar @xmath23 is not constrained very much from lep data",
    ", we can choose a light value , for example @xmath58 about 100 gev in our numerical analysis .",
    "the four degrees of freedom in the two real @xmath43 and @xmath59 and the complex @xmath60 can be replaced by the other four parameters , two masses @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the light and heavy charged octet higgs , and two angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the cp violating short distance physics induces the effective vertex of the electric dipole @xmath65 of the fermion @xmath66 coupled with the electromagnetic field strength @xmath67 , @xmath68 the two - loop barr - zee diagram also involves the pseudoscalar coupling of @xmath23 to fermions , @xmath69 a   \\ , \\ ] ] where the electron shares similar pattern of the yukawa coupling as the down quark .",

    "the relevant function is defined by @xmath71 which has asymptotic behaviors , @xmath72 the electron edm is evaluated as the difference between two contributions from the light and heavy color octets @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "2 the edm component due to the light @xmath40 pretending @xmath73 for given @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "the horizontal double - line is the present experimental upper bound .",
    ", width=576 ]    similarly , we can obtain the quark edm by rescaling parameters , @xmath78 we can also work out@xcite the associated color dipole moment ( cdm ) @xmath79 of the quark @xmath80 in the effective vertex by replacing color factors and couplings . on the other hand , ref.@xcite , has studied the contribution of the color octet to the gluon dipole@xcite , known as the weinberg operator@xcite , which is subjected to large renormalization suppression@xcite .",
    "due to the sophisticated hadron physics , we only have a qualitative relation between the neutron edm and the cp violating coefficients , mainly based on naive dimensional analysis@xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the electron edm is well predicted because it is independent of the hadronic structure .",
    "the octet - colored scalars if exist will be copiously produced@xcite by lhc in coming years because of its strong interaction and its larger color representation . when their masses and couplings are determined , the electron edm measurement is the key to disclose its nature of the cp violation .",
    "we show in this paper that the electron edm measurement is sensitive to the cp violating phase in the octet - colored scalars .",
