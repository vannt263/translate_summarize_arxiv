    "since the work of seiberg and witten @xcite several programs have emerged allowing one to compute the stable spectrum of bps solitons at any given point in the moduli space .",
    "a knowledge of central charges allows one to compute the location of walls of stability where solitons _ might _ decay but one must work harder to show that a given soliton really does decay .",
    "this was first done in @xcite , indirectly , by using global properties of the moduli space .",
    "one may compactify a type ii string on a  threefold @xmath4 to obtain a theory in four dimensions with a nonperturbative nonabelian gauge symmetry .",
    "the systematics of obtaining a particular gauge group with a particular matter content are well understood @xcite . by going to a particular corner of the moduli space @xcite one",
    "can then decouple gravity to obtain a supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills field theory .",
    "one says the field theory has been `` geometrically engineered '' @xcite from a type ii string theory .",
    "one would then like to obtain the spectrum of bps solitons of the yang ",
    "mills theory from a knowledge of the bps states in the type ii string theory  namely bps d - branes .",
    "bps d - branes occur in two types on a threefold .",
    "the a - branes may be navely pictured as special lagrangian 3-manifolds in @xmath4 , while b - branes may be navely pictured as holomorphic subspaces of @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that neither of these statements is quite right makes d - branes on  threefolds a very interesting area of current research .    in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) a method of analyzing solitons as a - branes in this context was given . in recent years",
    "many other approaches to analyzing the bps spectrum have appeared , including @xcite to name but a few . in this paper",
    "we will directly analyze the soliton spectrum yet another way , by using b - branes , the derived category of coherent sheaves and @xmath2-stability .",
    "we justify this in several ways :    * we believe that ultimately this provides a relatively simple way of determining soliton spectra , even though one has to first learn the machinery of the derived category .",
    "* one can view this paper as a test of the idea of @xmath2-stability , which it passes beautifully .",
    "* this is probably the easiest example of @xmath2-stability to understand completely .",
    "* one might argue that the degree of rigour in the b - brane picture compares very favourably with most of the other methods .",
    "for example , at this point in time it is probably safe to say that b - branes are better - understood than a - branes , since the topological a - model is subject to world - sheet instanton corrections .",
    "recent progress in the derived category picture @xcite appears to promise a substantially complete understanding of b - branes in the limit of weak string coupling .",
    "in particular it incorporates all @xmath5-corrections .",
    "since we wish to analyze the stability of solitons , the key question for us to analyze will concern the _ stability _ of objects in the derived category .",
    "this is the subject of `` @xmath2-stability '' .",
    "criteria for @xmath2-stability have been discussed in @xcite with further examples discussed in @xcite .",
    "the technique consists of starting at large radius limit , where one may use the classical picture of b - branes as holomorphic submanifolds , and then following the relative `` gradings '' of the stable branes as one moves along paths in the moduli space .",
    "this is quite a formidable computation in general , but it has been pursued on some cases ( see @xcite for example ) . in the model studied in this paper ,",
    "the  threefold is a k3-fibration over a @xmath3 .",
    "much of the analysis can be described using the derived category of @xmath3 , rather than that of the whole  threefold , which results in a relatively simple determination of the stable spectra .",
    "the derived category can be a technically intimidating subject to those unfamiliar with the language of homological algebra . in this paper",
    "we attempt to keep the technical details to a minimum .",
    "while this paper was derived as consequence of the results of a previous paper @xcite , we hope this paper can be understood to a large extent without a knowledge of this earlier work .",
    "we should note that the paper @xcite is similar to this paper in many ways .",
    "there the bps spectrum was obtained by using quivers and @xmath6-stability in the same geometric engineering context that we use .",
    "@xmath2-stability is a more general picture than @xmath6-stability so this paper can be thought of as a completion of the work in @xcite to the whole moduli space .    in section [ s : mod ]",
    "we review the basic setup of the geometrical engineering required to analyze the seiberg  witten theory .",
    "section [ s : stab ] consists of the analysis of the stable spectrum .",
    "this analysis is performed for three regions of the moduli space .",
    "firstly , in section [ ss : weak ] , near the large radius limit .",
    "then we cross the line of marginal stability into the strongly - coupled regime in section [ ss : strong ] , and then , lastly , we push through back into the weak - coupling region in section [ ss : mon ] . for this last computation",
    "we are required to go beyond the derived category of @xmath3 as we explain in section [ ss : vs ] .",
    "in this section we quickly review how to obtain a pure @xmath1 supersymmetric yang  mills theory from a type iia string compactified on a  threefold @xmath4 .",
    "assume @xmath4 is a k3 fibration over a base @xmath7 with a section .",
    "if @xmath8 ( i.e. the section ) is large , then we may expect any nonabelian gauge symmetry to arise essentially from the type iia string compactified on a k3 @xcite .",
    "one way for this to occur is the appearance of an a - d - e singularity in the k3 fibres .",
    "another way is that the k3 fibres acquire just the right volume .",
    "these situations are essentially t - dual to each other ( see , for example , @xcite for a review ) .    in the case that singularities appear in the k3 fibres",
    "one may focus attention near these singularities and analyze this non - compact region .",
    "this is generally the method used in `` geometric engineering '' @xcite .",
    "while we could do that here , for simplicity of exposition , we will use the case where the k3 fibres acquire a particular volume to achieve an enhanced gauge symmetry .",
    "we will use the well - known example of @xcite , where @xmath4 is a degree 8 hypersurface in the resolution of the weighted projective space @xmath9 .    in order to analyze the quantum - corrected moduli space of complexified khler forms on @xmath4 we require an analysis of the mirror @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath10 is given as a @xmath11 quotient of the same hypersurface with defining equation @xmath12 the `` algebraic '' coordinates on the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath10 are then given by @xmath13 now use the mirror map to relate these coordinates to the complexified khler form on @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath14 represent the component proportional to the area of a curve in the k3 fibre , and let @xmath15 represent the component giving the area of the base @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath16 where the higher - order terms are obtained from the picard ",
    "fuchs equations in the usual way .",
    "next we compute the locus of `` bad '' conformal field theories @xmath17 , which can also be thought of as the locus where @xmath10 becomes singular",
    ". the `` primary '' component of @xmath17 can be computed as @xmath18 there is also another component @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the enhanced gauge symmetry will not actually appear unless one is at the limit where @xmath8 becomes infinitely large , i.e. @xmath21 . for such a nonperturbative effect we must lie on the discriminant locus , forcing @xmath22 .    to probe the quantum effects of @xmath1 yang ",
    "mills theories we copy the trick from @xcite and do a double scaling limit to zoom in on this point @xmath23 . in particular we set @xmath24 and take the limit @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 now intersects the @xmath27-plane at @xmath28 .",
    "this is the @xmath27-plane of seiberg and witten @xcite .",
    "we will now use monodromy to establish which solitons are becoming massless where .",
    "traditionally this is done using matrices denoting the monodromy action on _ charges_. we want to know the monodromy action on the solitons themselves rather than just the charges , so we use fourier  mukai transforms .",
    "in particular we rely heavily on the results and conjectures of @xcite .",
    "first set @xmath21 and perform monodromy around @xmath22 .",
    "as described in the main example of @xcite , this corresponds to an `` ez - transform '' @xcite associated to the fibration @xmath29 . according to @xcite _ the d - branes on @xmath4 which become massless at this point are generated by @xmath30 , the derived category of @xmath8_. in particular",
    ", the basic objects of interest in @xmath31 are @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "this statement is key to this paper . because of the scaling limit we are taking , any d - brane which is not massless at @xmath23 has effectively infinite mass and",
    "will be ignored .",
    "thus all the solitons of interest in @xmath1 gauge theory are associated to the derived category of @xmath7 .",
    "the simplicity of the soliton spectrum of @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theory is thus related to the fact that the derived category of @xmath3 is easy to analyze .",
    "one can not ask for a simpler nontrivial space to analyze as far as the derived category is concerned .",
    "in fact , one may build all objects in @xmath30 from two basic objects : @xmath34  the structure sheaf of @xmath8 , and @xmath35  the skyscraper sheaf of a point @xmath36 .",
    "that is , all objects can be constructed by binding together ( in a sense to be described ) and translating these basic ingredients .",
    "in order to analyze the stability of solitons we need to find the central charges of the relevant objects in the derived category .",
    "these central charges are determined by periods , and so we need to solve the picard  fuchs equations . for our calabi ",
    "yau threefold @xmath4 the relevant picard ",
    "fuchs differential operators are ( with @xmath37 , and similarly for @xmath38 ) @xcite @xmath39    following the analysis of @xcite we introduce the variables @xmath40 for the field theory limit we scale @xmath41 , while @xmath42 assumes arbitrary values .    in terms of the new variables , the second picard ",
    "fuchs operator in ( [ eq : e1 ] ) becomes @xmath43    for brevity we focus on the semiclassical regime of the gauge theory , i.e. @xmath44 , although , as pointed out in @xcite , the monopole and dyon regimes allow for a similar treatment .",
    "accordingly , the solutions we seek are power series expansions around @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that the picard  fuchs system ( [ eq : e1 ] ) has four solutions with index @xmath46 and two solutions with index @xmath47 .",
    "instead of listing all the solutions , we focus on the most interesting one : @xmath48 + x_{{2}}^{3/2 } \\left [ 84+o ( x_{{1 } } ) \\right]+ o ( x_{{2}}^{5/2})\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : ser1}\\ ] ] up to a constant , these are the first few terms of the seiberg - witten period @xmath49 , at least to leading order in @xmath50 .",
    "we specialize our analysis for this solution as follows . in the @xmath41",
    "limit the leading terms of ( [ eq : e3 ] ) are ) vanishes identically in this limit . ]",
    "@xmath51 and this results in the relevant part of the solution ( [ eq : ser1 ] ) satisfying the ode @xmath52 recalling that @xmath53 , we can make a final change of variables @xmath54 , transforming ( [ eq : e4 ] ) into @xmath55    the central charge of a d - brane is a function of the d - brane charge .",
    "the d - brane charge is measured by k - theory .",
    "the k - group of @xmath3 is @xmath56 , generated by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we may take the two generators of @xmath30 , namely @xmath34 and @xmath35 , to be the generators of the k - group .",
    "the chern characters of the sheaves generate @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "we therefore require only two basic central charges @xmath59 to determine the central charges of all solitons .",
    "the notation has been chosen to coincide with seiberg and witten @xcite .",
    "the central charges should be ratios of periods , i.e. , ratios of solutions to ( [ eq : e1 ] ) .",
    "in the geometric engineering case , the `` denominator '' period in these ratios is taken to be the one associated to the 0-brane , which is constant in the scaling limit .",
    "this means that the central charges must satisfy ( [ eq : swde ] ) _ up to an additive constant_. this agrees with seiberg ",
    "witten theory ( see @xcite for a review and references ) .    @xmath49 and @xmath60 may be determined by monodromy as follows . at @xmath28 the primary component of the discriminant hits the @xmath27-plane . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "there is considerable evidence that the structure sheaf @xmath61 corresponds to a massless soliton in this case .",
    "this statement is basepoint dependent however .",
    "what we should really do is choose a basepoint close to , say , @xmath62 and say that @xmath63 becomes massless there .",
    "thus @xmath64 at @xmath62 .",

    "exactly which d - brane becomes massless depends on the path from the basepoint to @xmath65 .",
    "let us focus on the `` direct '' paths which do not encircle @xmath62 .",
    "then we have essentially two choices of path which go either side of @xmath62 . as explained in detail in @xcite , for example , the fourier ",
    "mukai transform associated to monodromy around @xmath65 may be derived by composing other fourier  mukai transforms . in our case",
    ", these rules dictate that @xmath66 becomes massless at @xmath65 depending on our choice of path as shown in figure [ f : paths1 ] .",
    "since @xmath67 , this amounts to @xmath68 vanishing at @xmath65 .",
    "up to an overall multiplicative constant , this determines @xmath49 and @xmath60 uniquely to coincide with those given in @xcite .",
    "this identification with the original work by seiberg and witten shows that the structure sheaf @xmath61 corresponds to the `` magnetic monopole '' , i.e. , the 6-brane wrapping @xmath4 .",
    "the other generator @xmath69 has the right d - brane charge to be associated with the electrically charged `` w - boson '' . in section [ ss : weak ]",
    "we will see that it really is the w - boson since it is stable .",
    "if @xmath70 is the k3 fibre over the point @xmath36 , then @xmath69 is the structure sheaf of @xmath70 extended by zero over the rest of @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath69 is a 4-brane wrapped around a k3 fibre .",
    "this is consistent with the general assumption ( for example in @xcite ) that the w - bosons arise from d - branes wrapping the k3 fibres ( or curves within the k3 fibres ) .",
    "classically we have a whole family of w - bosons since we may move @xmath71 to be any point in @xmath8 .",
    "however , as argued in @xcite in this case , quantum mechanics implies that one should count states by computing the cohomology of the moduli space .",
    "this means that there is really only one w - boson  not a whole @xmath3 s worth .",
    "note that the above analysis shows that the _ rank _ of a sheaf on @xmath3 gives the `` magnetic charge '' while the _ degree _ of a sheaf gives the `` electric charge '' .",
    "we are now in a position to establish the spectrum of d - branes at any point in the @xmath27-plane . we know that the d - branes in question must be generated by pull - backs to @xmath4 of objects in the derived category of @xmath8 .",
    "we also know the central charges of such objects .",
    "armed with @xmath2-stability we can solve this problem by determining which objects are stable .",
    "note that the words `` generated by '' above are a little loaded .",
    "we may need to consider morphisms outside @xmath30 but we postpone this fact until section [ ss : mon ] .",
    "objects in the derived category are complexes of sheaves . for any such complex @xmath72 we may define @xmath73 $ ] simply as the same complex shifted ( or `` translated '' ) @xmath74 places left . as explained in @xcite a simultaneous shift of all d - branes by @xmath74 is a gauge symmetry with an odd @xmath74 representing an exchange of d - branes with anti - d - branes .",
    "relative shifts do matter however .",
    "an open string stretched between @xmath72 and @xmath75 is only the same as an open string stretched between @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath75 if @xmath76 .    in the derived category picture ,",
    "open strings between a d - brane @xmath72 and a d - brane @xmath75 are given by maps in @xmath77,\\mathsf{b})$ ] for any value of @xmath74 .",
    "the maps in @xmath78,\\mathsf{b})$ ] are of particular interest as giving these strings a vacuum expectation value forms a `` bound '' state of @xmath72 and @xmath75 as explained in @xcite .",
    "mathematically this new object formed by the bound state is called the `` cone '' of the corresponding map @xmath79\\to\\mathsf{b}$ ] . a nice explanation for this language is given in @xcite . in derived category language",
    "this leads to a `` distinguished triangle '' : @xmath80|{[1]}&\\\\ \\mathsf{a}[-1]\\ar[rr]^f&&\\mathsf{b}.\\ar[ul ] }    \\label{eq : abc}\\ ] ] any vertex of this triangle is a potential bound state of the other two vertices .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details . whether or not each state really is bound or not depends upon the mass of the open string forming the map on the opposite edge of the triangle .",
    "only when this open string is tachyonic do we achieve a bound state .",
    "the `` @xmath81 $ ] '' on the arrow in ( [ eq : abc ] ) means that a left - shift of one is included in the map .",
    "this `` [ 1 ] '' may be shuffled around to any edge of the triangle if the objects at the vertices are shifted accordingly .",
    "such shuffles will occur frequently in the computations below .",
    "the rules of computing the masses of these open strings arise from @xmath2-stability as follows @xcite .",
    "each stable d - brane is given a `` grade '' @xmath82 which varies continuously over the moduli space .",
    "it is not single - valued over the moduli space however .",
    "it is defined mod 2 by the central charge @xmath83 and @xmath84)=\\varphi(\\mathsf{a})+n$ ] . to complete the definition of @xmath85",
    "one can declare that the grade of a coherent sheaf lies in some fixed range ( say , between @xmath86 and 0 ) near the large radius limit @xcite .",
    "the mass of an open string stretched from @xmath87 $ ] to @xmath75 is then proportional to @xmath88 as explained in @xcite . in this way",
    "we may determine the regions of stability for all potential d - branes .",
    "points of marginal stability in the @xmath27-plane can appear wherever @xmath89 . given ( [ eq : phidef1 ] )",
    "this means that the ratio of the central charges of @xmath72 and @xmath75 is real . for pure @xmath1",
    "there is only a two - dimensional lattice of possible d - brane charges , i.e. , all central charges are linear combinations of @xmath49 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus the only possible points of marginal stability occur when @xmath90 is real . as is well - known @xcite , the set of such points forms a near - ellipse passing through @xmath28 .",
    "we show this as a dotted line in figure [ f : paths1 ] and refer to it as the `` ms - line '' .",
    "let us begin `` outside '' the ellipse of marginal stability .",
    "since this is the only ms - line of concern , we may move to very large @xmath91 without effecting the stable spectrum . in terms of @xmath4 , this allows us to move to the large radius limit of @xmath4 where all @xmath5-corrections are very small .    in the large radius limit",
    "we expect the classical analysis of d - branes such as in @xcite to hold true and b - type d - branes should correspond to stable holomorphic vector bundles over complex analytic subspaces of @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "coherent sheaves that are locally free over some complex subspace of @xmath4 ( possibly all of @xmath4 ) and zero elsewhere .",
    "our interest is in sheaves of particular type : those that can be written as the pullback of a sheaf on @xmath8 described by the previous sentence .",
    "as explained earlier , only these sheaves will correspond to solitons associated to the @xmath1 theory in question .",
    "the classification of such sheaves on @xmath3 is very easy .",
    "first we have @xmath35 , the skyscraper sheaf of a point .",
    "this is classically stable since it has no subsheaves .",
    "this pulls back to @xmath4 to give the structure sheaf of a k3 fibre .",
    "as seen in section [ ss : idz ] , this stable soliton is identified with the w - boson .",
    "the only remaining possibilities are stable vector bundles over @xmath3 .",
    "thanks to a theorem of grothendieck @xcite all vector bundles of rank @xmath92 over @xmath7 are isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles @xmath93 for integers @xmath94 .",
    "such bundles of rank one are stable . to show this we could use classical @xmath95-stability which is related to @xmath2-stability at large radius @xcite .",
    "we choose to employ @xmath2-stability directly to keep a more consistent language throughout this paper .",
    "near the large radius limit we use @xcite @xmath96 and fix @xmath97 .",
    "it follows that @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a some small positive real number which goes to zero in the large radius limit , and @xmath101 is a @xmath102 dependent constant .",
    "note that this need not agree with the corresponding values computed by using the @xmath49 and @xmath60 basis of section [ ss : idz ] since the central charge has been left undefined up to an overall constant .",
    "what is true however , is that the relative _ differences _ between grades determined by @xmath49 and @xmath60 must agree with this large radius limit .    in order to destabilize @xmath103",
    "we need to build a distinguished triangle with @xmath103 at one corner .",
    "this requires a map @xmath104 for some stable sheaf @xmath105 .",
    "no map exists for @xmath106 .",
    "suppose @xmath107 for some @xmath92 .",
    "a map @xmath108 only exists if @xmath109 . the case of @xmath110 is trivial as this corresponds to @xmath103 decaying into itself plus nothing !",
    "we may therefore assume @xmath111 .",
    "as far as sheaves are concerned , distinguished triangles amount to short exact sequences completed into a triangle by adding the arrow with a `` [ 1 ] '' in it .",
    "this leads to a triangle @xmath112|{[1]}&\\\\ \\o_c(r)\\ar[rr]^g&&\\o_c(s),\\ar[ul ] }    \\label{eq : rk1}\\ ] ] where , by a slight abuse of notation , @xmath113 is the skyscraper sheaf of @xmath114 points . but @xmath115 which is less than zero showing stability .",
    "thus rank one bundles are stable against decay into other rank one bundles or skyscraper sheaves .",
    "we will soon see that higher rank bundles are unstable so we do not need to consider them as possible decay products of rank one bundles .    but",
    "the reason higher rank bundles are unstable is because they will be shown to decay into rank one bundles .",
    "such analysis will implicitly assume that the rank one bundles are indeed stable , so we have a circular argument .",
    "to be rigorous we should turn to @xmath95-stability . here",
    "a bundle can only be unstable with respect to a subbundle .",
    "clearly a rank one bundle can not have a higher rank subbundle and so we immediately rule out such decays .",
    "what is at work here is that sheaves form an _",
    "category and allow the notion of a subobject .",
    "the derived category has no notion of subobject and so @xmath2-stability is always plagued by such circularity .",
    "the importance of abelian categories to establish a set of stable solitons at least at some basepoint in the moduli space was emphasized by douglas @xcite .",
    "we now consider the stability of rank 2 bundles .",
    "the bundle @xmath116 fits into the triangle @xmath117&\\\\ \\o_c(s)\\ar[rr]|(0.6){[1]}^f&&\\o_c(t),\\ar[ul ] }    \\label{eq : rk2}\\ ] ] where @xmath118)=\\ext^1(\\o_c(s),\\o_c(t))$ ] .",
    "the direct sum @xmath116 occurs when the map @xmath119 is the zero map .",
    "if @xmath119 is any other map , it will deform the direct sum into some other extension of @xmath103 by @xmath120 according to the usual theory of extensions @xcite .",
    "but @xmath121 has dimension @xmath122 if @xmath123 and is trivial otherwise .",
    "now @xmath124 this implies that if @xmath125 then we have no open string along the bottom edge of ( [ eq : rk2 ] ) and the direct sum @xmath116 remains as it is , at least according to this triangle .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath123 , then , according to ( [ eq : stbind ] ) , we have a tachyon along the bottom edge of the triangle ( [ eq : rk2 ] ) . one",
    "might therefore be tempted to say that the top vertex of the triangle is stable , but we need to think carefully about this .    the fact that the open string given by @xmath119 is tachyonic means that it wishes to acquire a nonzero expectation value .",
    "that is , we need to `` turn on '' @xmath126 to make a nontrivial extension .",
    "this will deform the direct sum @xmath116 into a rank 2 coherent sheaf , which turns out to be another rank 2 bundle @xmath127 @xcite , which is another extension of @xmath103 by @xmath120 .",
    "but by grothendieck s theorem , all rank 2 bundles are of the form @xmath128 , for some integers @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "that is , we have a nontrivial extension @xmath131 by looking at degrees , it is clear that @xmath132 , while surjectivity of the map @xmath133 in ( [ eq : extg ] ) forces @xmath134 . now",
    "if @xmath135 then we may repeat the process since we will still have a tachyon .",
    "it is clear then that we only achieve stability when @xmath136 equals 0 or 1 .",
    "clearly the rles of @xmath137 and @xmath138 can be exchanged in this discussion so we arrive at the conclusion that _ the rank two bundle @xmath139 will `` decay '' into @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "_    so suppose we have a rank two bundle @xmath139 with @xmath143 .",

    ", a sheaf @xmath147 will have dyon charge @xmath148 .",
    "thus two dyons of charge @xmath149 and @xmath150 will have a tachyonic string between them and will therefore be `` attracted '' to form a bound state .",
    "the resulting dyon will have charge @xmath151 .",
    "this latter state is composed of dyons of charge @xmath152 and @xmath153 which do not interact by open strings and are free to fly apart .    clearly we may generalize this result to higher rank .",
    "any higher rank bundle will decay into a set of line bundles whose degrees differ by at most one .",
    "this uniquely identifies the decay products of any bundle .",
    "any dyon of charge @xmath154 for @xmath155 is therefore unstable to decay into dyons with @xmath156 . by a similar reasoning",
    "there are no stable states of charge @xmath157 for @xmath158 .",
    "these would have to correspond to a bound state of skyscrapers @xmath35  but clearly these skyscrapers all have the same grade @xmath85 and so we could never develop tachyons between them .",
    "the only stable states therefore are @xmath147 and @xmath35 which have dyon charge @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively .",
    "as always , we also have all the translates given by @xmath161 $ ] and @xmath162 $ ] for any @xmath74 which includes the corresponding anti - particles .",
    "this spectrum is in agreement with known results @xcite .",
    "now that we have established a stable set of d - branes near large radius limit , we may venture to cross the ms - line and see what @xmath2-stability tells us . this may be determined purely from the properties of d - branes from the last section , i.e. , d - branes stable at large radius .",
    "one might fear that , as we cross the ms - line , a new stable soliton appears that is a bound state of formerly _ unstable _ solitons .",
    "fortunately , thanks to an analysis of the octahedral axiom in @xcite , this need not be considered .",
    "the formerly unstable solitons must themselves have been some unbound state of stable solitons which may instead be used as the constituent particles for the desired new soliton as we cross the ms - line .",
    "naturally , what happens as we cross the line of marginal stability depends on the path taken .",
    "let us first assume that we cross the _ upper _ half of the line of marginal stability by taking the upper path of figure [ f : paths1 ] .    integrating the differential equation ( [ eq : swde ] ) we find that this portion of the ms - line corresponds to @xmath163 a real number with @xmath164 at @xmath165 continuously decreasing to @xmath166 at @xmath65 .",
    "we now try to define @xmath167 as a real number varying continuously in the @xmath27-plane in order to obtain the @xmath85 s of our d - branes . at large radius limit",
    "we may use ( [ eq : lrl ] ) to establish that @xmath168 , fixing the @xmath169 ambiguity . as we approach the ms - line this number increases steadily to @xmath170 .",
    "that is , slightly above this line of marginal stability @xmath167 is a little less than @xmath170 .",
    "as we move past the line , @xmath167 passes through @xmath170 . to define a continuous function , consistent with the grading",
    ", we say that @xmath167 is a little bit greater than @xmath170 .    in order to establish the spectrum of stable d - branes",
    "as the ms - line is crossed we need to consider all possible distinguished triangles with vertices corresponding to the stable d - branes found in the last section .",
    "all of our objects are of the form @xmath32 for some @xmath33 .",
    "unfortunately it is not true that all morphisms @xmath171 in the derived category of @xmath4 can be obtained by pulling back a morphism @xmath172 as we discuss in section [ ss : vs ] . for this section , however , it turns out that we can get away with making this assumption and we need only consider distinguished triangles in the derived category of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact we only need to consider a single distinguished triangle to obtain the result .",

    "but @xmath182 itself will also decay into @xmath34 and @xmath179 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath181 will actually decay into @xmath34 and two copies of @xmath179 $ ] , assuming that these final products are stable .",
    "anyway , at this point we have shown that all states @xmath147 for @xmath180 will decay .    now consider @xmath133 .",
    "one obtains @xmath183 now if @xmath184 , this difference is close to @xmath177 and so we have stability .",
    "however , if @xmath185 then this difference will increase through 0 as we cross the ms - line .",
    "thus @xmath178 will then decay into @xmath147 and @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , all states @xmath147 for @xmath158 will decay by this route .    at this point",
    "we see that @xmath147 is only stable if @xmath186 or 1 . thus to check for stability of @xmath35 using the map @xmath119 in ( [ eq : tri ] ) we need only consider @xmath186 .",

    "that is , @xmath35 decays into @xmath188 and @xmath189 $ ] .",
    "the final result is that the only stable solitons after we cross the ms - line are @xmath34 and @xmath188 ( and their translates corresponding to anti - solitons ) .",
    "thus , in the example above , @xmath181 would actually decay into three copies of @xmath34 and two copies of @xmath190 $ ] .",
    "note that we have only dyon charges @xmath191 and @xmath192 in agreement again with known results @xcite .",
    "we may repeat the above analysis for the _ lower _ half of the ms - line by taking the lower path of figure [ f : paths1 ] .",
    "the only difference in the analysis is that now @xmath193 when we hit the ms - line .",
    "the result now is that the only stable solitons consist of @xmath34 and @xmath182 .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that monodromy around the monopole point @xmath62 transforms @xmath188 into @xmath194 $ ] .",
    "suppose now we continue our journey and pass through the other wall of the region bounded by the ms - line and return to the weakly coupled region as shown by the path in figure [ f : paths2 ] .",
    "one should return to a set of stable solitons physically equivalent to those found in section [ ss : weak ] , but they may not actually be the same elements of the derived category .",
    "that is , we undergo some monodromy in the spectrum .",
    "monodromy has been analyzed extensively using fourier ",
    "mukai transforms ( see @xcite and references therein ) but , rather than use this technology , we will just continue the above analysis .",
    "( 240,200)(-120,-100 ) ( -100,0 ) ( 100,0 ) ( 103,-8 ) ( -140,-8 ) ( 140,40 ) ( 144,40 ) ( 0,0)(140,40 , 50,70 , 0,-100 ) ( 50,90 ) ( -50,0 ) ( 2,-103 )    all the distinguished triangles in @xmath30 are basically obtained from ( [ eq : tri ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , if we use the analysis of section [ ss : strong ] , then nothing happens to the spectrum as we cross back into the weakly - coupled region .",
    "in particular , the open string corresponding to a map @xmath195 has mass squared proportional to @xmath196)$ ] , which simply gets larger and larger as we follow the path in figure [ f : paths2 ] . the bound state , which gives @xmath35 , becomes unstable as we enter the strong coupled region and is even more unstable as we leave again .",
    "the problem is that we now need to worry about open strings arising from morphisms that can not be pulled back from @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath197 , one can show that @xmath198 where @xmath199)$ ] .",
    "that is , we have a 2-dimensional hilbert space of open strings from @xmath200 $ ] to @xmath201 $ ] .",
    "now , analysis of the periods shows that @xmath202)-\\varphi(\\pi^*\\o_c(1))$ ] decreases as we follow the path and falls below zero as we hit the lower portion of the ms - line in figure [ f : paths2 ] .",
    "thus we acquire new bound states of @xmath203 and @xmath201 $ ] which we call @xmath204",
    ". classically we have a @xmath3 s worth of these states @xmath204 just like the old @xmath35 s .",
    "this is very reminiscent of the 0-branes living on flopped @xmath3 s analyzed in @xcite .",
    "@xmath204 sits in the following distinguished triangle : @xmath205|{[1]}&\\\\ \\pi^*\\o_c(1)[-1]\\ar[rr]&&\\pi^*\\o_c[2].\\ar[ul ] }    \\label{eq : trix}\\ ] ] consider this to be a special case of the following distinguished triangle @xmath205|{[1]}&\\\\ \\cy_m\\ar[rr]&&\\cy_{m+1},\\ar[ul ] }    \\label{eq : trixn}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 $ ] and @xmath207 $ ] .",
    "this may be used to define @xmath208 inductively as a bound state of @xmath209 and @xmath204 , or @xmath210 as a bound state of @xmath209 and @xmath211 $ ] .",
    "this defines ( at least up to isomorphism ) objects @xmath209 in @xmath31 for @xmath212 .",
    "working through the gradings using the rules of @xcite it is not hard to show that _ all _ of the @xmath209 s become stable as we pass below the ms - line back into the weak - coupling regime .",
    "there are no other homomorphisms between these stable objects of the right relative grades to produce any new stable states .",
    "thus the stable spectrum consists of @xmath204 and @xmath209 for all @xmath213 .    of course these states",
    "should correspond to the original set of stable states under monodromy around @xmath62 , i.e. , the primary component of the discriminant .",
    "one can use the transforms discussed in @xcite to show that this is indeed the case .",
    "it is easy to compute the dyon charges of @xmath204 and @xmath209 as @xmath214 and @xmath215 respectively which is in agreement with the known monodromy matrices @xcite .",
    "it is worth dwelling on a couple of points raised in the analysis of this section .",
    "first let us consider the `` cascade '' of new states coming from ( [ eq : trixn ] ) as we crossed the ms - line .",
    "the rules of computing grades analyzed in @xcite said that when a new bound state is formed , the grade of the new state is identical to the grades of the constituent states ( shifted by 1 as necessary ) . thus if @xmath72 can bind to @xmath75",
    "then the grades would imply @xmath72 can bind to the resulting bound state .",
    "thus @xmath72 appears able to bind an arbitrary number of times to @xmath75 . however , this can only happen if open strings exist to produce the necessary bindings .",
    "in particular , just because there is a morphism from @xmath72 to @xmath75 , there might not be a morphism from @xmath72 to the bound state of @xmath72 and @xmath75 .",
    "then only one copy of @xmath72 would be able to bind to @xmath75 .",
    "the relationship between the dimensions of the various hom groups can be computed using long exact sequences associated to the triangles .",
    "the magic that happens in ( [ eq : trixn ] ) is that these long exact sequences work out just right to make @xmath216)$ ] and @xmath217 independent of @xmath213 .",
    "it is this property that allows us to add @xmath204 s indefinitely to the d - branes @xmath209 .",
    "the other point is that the original set of states at weak coupling all look nice in the sense that they have clear interpretations in terms of d - branes wrapped on cycles in @xmath4 , whereas after monodromy we have more exotic objects in the derived category that can not ( except for @xmath218 and @xmath219 ) be written as sheaves .",
    "thus if we sit in the strong coupling region there seems to be an asymmetry between moving up or moving down into the weak coupling regime",
    ".    however , if we view things purely in the derived category they look more symmetric .",
    "when we sit in the strong - coupling region we have only two stable d - branes which we denote @xmath72 and @xmath75 . as we move across the ms - line into the weak coupling regime these two solitons",
    "can form a bound state @xmath220 which plays the rle of the w - boson . crossing the ms - line",
    "upwards this bound state is formed by condensing a tachyon given by the open string associated to the map @xmath221 .",
    "crossing the ms - line downwards is exactly the same except this time @xmath220 is formed from the open string @xmath222 $ ] .",
    "this is essentially serre duality at work and is very similar to the examples studied in @xcite for finding exotic solitons on the quintic threefold .",
    "it is also entertaining to note that the `` 3 '' appearing here shows that the intrinsic structure of the solitons in seiberg  witten theory `` knows '' that it should be associated with a  of dimension three !",
    "once we have crossed into the weak coupling regime , @xmath220 may bind to an arbitrary number of copies of @xmath72 or @xmath75 to form the remaining stable solitons .",
    "this description is valid independent of any basepoint chosen .",
    "the basepoint is only required to explicitly describe the solitons as complexes of sheaves .",
    "finally let us note again that in sections [ ss : weak ] and [ ss : strong ] we were able to couch our description of the d - branes purely in terms of the derived category of the base @xmath7 of the k3-fibration .",
    "this explains the relative simplicity of the analysis of solitons in seiberg ",
    "witten theory .",
    "the complete description , in terms of @xmath31 , may add more morphisms than are seen in @xmath30 but these extra open strings play no rle in tachyon condensation near large radius .",
    "once we venture `` too far '' however by looking at monodromy in section [ ss : mon ] we need the full derived category of @xmath4 to obtain the correct soliton spectrum .",
    "this may be understood schematically as follows . for two objects @xmath223 and @xmath224 in @xmath30 we have @xmath225 and thus the difference between the open strings in @xmath30 and the open strings in @xmath31 essentially corresponds to the difference between @xmath224 and @xmath226 .    at the large radius limit",
    "we assume that all b - type d - branes correspond to sheaves , i.e. , complexes in @xmath31 which have only one nonzero entry .",
    "we also confine the relative grades to small range @xmath227 .",
    "now @xmath226 is usually a longer complex than the single entry @xmath224 but in order to `` see '' the new terms in the complex in terms of tachyon condensation one needs larger relative grades .",
    "thus one needs to travel a large distance from the large radius limit to detect the new terms in @xmath226 .",
    "this is precisely what happened in section [ ss : mon ] .",
    "the purely @xmath30 morphisms gave us `` enough '' information to cover the whole moduli space once .",
    "it was only monodromy issues that showed @xmath30 s inadequacies .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the pure @xmath30 picture of the solitons in seiberg  witten theory persists for more complicated examples of @xmath0 theories beyond the pure @xmath1 theory considered here .",
