    "psr j04374715 has been observed intensively since its discovery by @xcite .",
    "it is the brightest and nearest observed millisecond pulsar , and has also been studied in the optical @xcite , ultraviolet @xcite , and x",
    " ray @xcite bands .",
    "the high rotational stability and close proximity of this pulsar  white dwarf binary system make it an excellent probe of general relativity ( gr ) and alternative forms of gravitational theories .",
    "the measurement of its shapiro delay by @xcite , where the radio waves from the pulsar are delayed as they pass through the gravitational potential of the companion , is one such test which has shown consistency with gr predictions .",
    "the search for the low frequency stochastic gravitational wave background ( gwb ) using pulsar timing arrays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is another test of gr which is facilitated in part by timing of j04374715 .",
    "although variation of newton s gravitational constant @xmath0  with time is forbidden in gr , this is not required in alternate formalisms of gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have measured the rate of change of orbital period @xmath5  in the j04374715 system to better than 2% precision and shown that the agreement of the derived kinematic distance with the parallax distance derived from timing limits the time variation of @xmath0  to less than 3 parts in @xmath6 . in this letter , we present a new very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) determination of the position , proper motion , and parallax of psr j04374715 and show that this improves the previously published @xmath7  limit derived from this system by an order of magnitude , approaching the best published limit ( @xmath8  yr@xmath2 ) , which is derived from lunar laser ranging ( llr ; * ? ? ?",
    "our vlbi observations and results are presented in ",
    "[ sec : vlbi ] and  [ sec : results ] respectively and the limitations on apparent accelerations ( due to @xmath7  or other possible causes such as unseen massive planets ) are derived in ",
    "[ sec : anomacc ] . in ",
    "[ sec : gwb ] , we investigate the impact of the stochastic gwb on our results and derive an independent limit on the gwb amplitude .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "details of the observational , correlation , and post  processing strategies used are covered in detail in @xcite and only a brief summary is presented here .",
    "four observational epochs ( mjd 53868 , 54055 , 54181 , 54416 ) spanned 1.5 years , with each epoch lasting 12 hours and utilizing all available antennas from the australian long baseline array ( lba ) .",
    "these were the three atnf antennas ( atca , parkes , mopra ) , the two university of tasmania antennas ( hobart and ceduna ) and , when available , one of the nasa deep space network ( dsn ) antennas at the tidbinbilla station .",
    "observations were made at 8.4 ghz , and four 16 mhz bands were used , quantized at two bit precision to give a total data rate of 256 mbps .",
    "phase referencing was conducted using the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) source j04394522 , a bright ( several hundred mjy flux at 8 ghz ) and compact radio source less than 2@xmath9  from psr j04374715 , whose position is known to 1 mas @xcite .",
    "a six minute target / calibrator cycle was employed , with observing time divided equally between the target and calibrator .",
    "the well  studied blazar pks 0537441 was used for bandpass calibration .",
    "the data were correlated , using matched filtering ( gating ) on pulse profiles , with the difx software correlator @xcite . due to the extremely narrow pulse profile of psr j04374715 at 8.4 ghz ,",
    "this gating improves the output signal to noise ratio ( snr ) by a factor of 7 compared to ungated data .",
    "the pulsar ephemeris used to set gates was taken from @xcite .    due to the relatively high frequency used for these observations ,",
    "several of the calibration steps described in @xcite proved unnecessary .",
    "data reduction was performed with and without gps  based ionospheric correction , and the small ( @xmath10as ) corrections which resulted from ionospheric correction gave a poorer parallax fit overall , with double the estimated systematic errors . given the uncertainty of gps  based corrections at these southern latitudes , the ionospheric corrections were therefore not applied . additionally ,",
    "the effect of scintillation was negligible at these higher frequencies , so the scintillation correction detailed in @xcite was not applied .    attaining single epoch accuracies of @xmath11as , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , required post - correlation corrections to the visibilities due to the proper motion of the pulsar ( @xmath12as in each 12 hour observation ) .",
    "additionally , the orbital motion of psr j04374715 causes a peak to peak displacement of @xmath13as .",
    "compensation for this displacement in the single  epoch positions improved the quality of the proper motion and parallax fit , reducing the estimated systematic error contribution by 3% .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the optimal weighting for visibility points when imaging the pulsar to fit for position depends on the ratio of thermal noise to residual systematic errors . for strong targets systematic errors dominate the error budget , meaning the use of equally weighted visibilities ( as opposed to weighting visibilities by baseline sensitivity ) produces superior results . for psr j04374715 the snr of a typical single  band , single ",
    "epoch detection was @xmath14 , well above the threshold of @xmath15  identified in @xcite , and thus we would expect equally weighted visibilities to produce superior results . to confirm this ,",
    "the parallax was determined from two separate datasets , which were produced using sensitivity  weighted and equally weighted visibilities .",
    "as expected , the equally weighted dataset produced a better fit , with smaller errors on fitted parameters and smaller estimated systematic error contributions .",
    "the data were fitted using an iterative approach designed to estimate and account for systematic errors , described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting parameter values are shown in table  [ tab : results ] along with the @xcite timing measurements ; the vlbi fits to pulsar motion and observed positions are shown in figure  [ fig:0437radec ] .",
    "all errors are 1@xmath16  unless otherwise stated , and include the covariances between fitted parameters . over this short timespan ,",
    "the covariance between parallax and proper motion is significant , and constitutes approximately half of the quoted parallax uncertainty .",
    "the average total single  epoch error of 132@xmath17as is the best relative astrometry performed by the lba to date , and is similar to other recent vlbi astrometric results ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by way of comparison ,",
    "the limiting accuracy for evn observations at 8.4 ghz has been simulated by @xcite to be 83@xmath17as with a 1@xmath9calibrator  target separation , at a declination of 50@xmath9 .",
    "the evn has similar sensitivity to the lba , but somewhat better uv coverage and longer baselines .",
    "our derived distance of @xmath18pc is the most accurate distance measurement ( in both absolute and fractional distance ) for a pulsar to date and approaches the most accurate distance measurements made of objects outside the solar system ( t tauri , @xmath19 : * ? ? ?",
    "previously , the highest ",
    "precision vlbi pulsar distance determinations were those made by @xcite , who measured the distance of psr j0953 + 0755 to an accuracy of 5 pc , along with 8 other northern hemisphere pulsars .",
    "the two previous parallax measurements made using a southern array , of psr j08354510 @xcite and psr j14566843 @xcite , had 1@xmath16distance errors of 19 and 70 pc respectively .      to compare the vlbi and timing positions , we have re ",
    "fitted the timing data of @xcite to obtain the position of psr j04374715 at our reference epoch ( mjd 54100 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] shows that the timing and vlbi positions at mjd 54100 differ by over two mas , many times the formal errors shown .",
    "however , the formal errors are negligible compared to the 1 mas uncertainty in the vlbi phase reference calibrator position and the potential constant offsets due to phase  referencing errors such as station position errors ( known to exist at the cm level for the lba ; * ? ? ?",
    "discrepancies between interferometric and timing positions of even larger magnitudes have been found using the de200 frame @xcite , and differences at the mas level still exist for the position psr j04374715 calculated using the newer de414 solar system ephemeris , as compared to the de405 ephemeris used by @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the vlbi and timing position difference is consistent with the uncertainty in the calibrator position and the offset between the solar system frame and the icrf .",
    "the values obtained for the vlbi proper motion differ by @xmath20  in both right ascension and declination from the timing values .",
    "a likely cause for this discrepancy is small changes in the centroid position of the phase reference source due to intrinsic source variability , which would be absorbed into the proper motion fit .",
    "the phase reference source , which is modeled by a @xmath21mas fwhm gaussian with additional delta components within 5 mas of strength 2% and 0.2% of peak flux , shows no gross evidence of variability ( width / positions of primary / secondary components constant to @xmath22as , and secondary fluxes are constant to @xmath21mjy ) , but as it is only barely resolved ( the beamsize is @xmath23mas ) variability at the @xmath10as level would be difficult to detect .",
    "@xcite show that some icrf sources exhibit apparent proper motions of hundreds of @xmath17as yr@xmath2 for periods of several years , and",
    "while a detailed vlbi history of this source is not available , calibrator measurements from atca show that the flux density has declined by a factor of three over a five year period , implying some variability . the higher proper motion precision obtained with the timing data ( a factor of 57 times better than the vlbi results ) reflects the fact that the timing data spans a time baseline 7 times longer than the vlbi dataset .",
    "the parallax value obtained from vlbi is consistent with that derived from timing , and yields a distance which is consistent with the kinematic distance of @xmath24  pc derived from the orbital period derivative @xmath5 .",
    "however , the vlbi parallax measurement is an order of magnitude more precise than the timing measurement , and yields a distance which is a factor of two more precise than the kinematic distance .",
    "the newly measured parallax of @xmath25mas allows an improved measurement of any anomalous acceleration of either the solar system or psr j04374715 .",
    "specifically , the apparent acceleration due to time variability of newton s gravitational constant @xmath0 and the mass of an undetected trans - neptunian planet near the line of sight to the pulsar can be limited .",
    "as first described by @xcite , a precise measurement of a binary pulsar s orbital period derivative , @xmath5 , can be used to constrain a variation of the gravitational constant , @xmath0 . however , as @xcite pointed out , for psr j0437@xmath264715 a precise distance needs to be known in order to correct @xmath5  for the shklovskii acceleration caused by its proper motion @xcite .",
    "this analysis has been performed , based exclusively on timing data , by @xcite , whose limit was dominated by the uncertainty in their parallax measurement .",
    "our vlbi parallax value , however , improves this limit by a factor of nearly 10 down to @xmath27  yr@xmath2  at 95% certainty .",
    "this value compares well to the most stringent limit currently published : @xmath28  yr@xmath2 , derived through lunar laser ranging @xcite . since @xmath29 and @xmath5  are now both measured to similar precision , both measurements will have to be improved for a further significant increase in @xmath7  sensitivity .",
    "additional vlbi observations and continued timing could see this limit improve upon the existing llr limit early in the next decade .",
    "an alternative source of anomalous acceleration is heavy planets in a wide orbit around the sun or the pulsar .",
    "building upon the initial analysis of @xcite , our parallax measurement can be combined with the timing results from @xcite to derive the following result : @xmath30  at the @xmath31 level .",
    "this improves the limit published in @xcite by an order of magnitude and makes psr j04374715 a more sensitive solar system accelerometer than psr j1713 + 0747 , the most precise pulsar listed by @xcite . from this , the limit for 50% of the skyof the line of sight towards and away from psr j04374715 ] can be calculated as : @xmath32 ( 95% certainty ) .",
    "this acceleration limit can be used to exclude massive bodies within a given radius of the sun ; for example , at kuiper  belt radii ( 50 au ) it excludes a planet more massive than uranus over 50% of the sky , while jupiter  mass planets are excluded within 226au over 50% of the sky .",
    "using tools recently developed by @xcite , we have simulated the effect of a gwb with spectral index @xmath33 ( as predicted for gwbs caused by black hole  black hole mergers ) and dimensionless amplitude @xmath34  ( the best published gwb limit ; @xcite ) on the observed value of @xmath5  from pulsar timing . the simulated gwb causes the kinematic distance to be inconsistent with the vlbi parallax distance at the 2@xmath16 level in @xmath35 of trials .",
    "thus , although these observations can not improve upon the present gwb limit , they are consistent with it . simulations with a gwb with amplitude of @xmath36 show inconsistencies between the kinematic and vlbi distances at the @xmath37 level in @xmath38  of trials , providing an independent exclusion of a gwb with an amplitude at or above this value .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the precise limit on @xmath7  presented in ",
    "[ subsec : gdot ] would be impossible in a universe with a strong gwb . in the simulations with gwb amplitude @xmath36 ,",
    "the observed @xmath7  value is inconsistent with 0 in @xmath39  of cases , merely due to the gwb - induced corruption of the timing measurements .",
    "thus , the stochastic gwb must eventually limit the accuracy of measurements of @xmath7  in the fashion outlined in this paper .",
    "we have observed psr j04374715 using the lba and obtained the most precise pulsar distance determination to date , with an error @xmath40pc . combined with accurate timing data ,",
    "this has enabled us to confirm that @xmath41  yr@xmath2 , the most stringent limit not obtained though solar system tests . alternatively , assuming an unchanging gravitational force , the results can be interpreted as excluding any unseen jupiter  mass planets within 226 au of the sun in 50% of the sky .",
    "finally , the agreement between vlbi and timing results in this single case implies an upper limit to the stochastic gwb amplitude which is within an order of magnitude of the best limit derived from observations of ensembles of pulsars .",
