    "understanding the current accelerated expansion of our universe has become one of the most important issues of modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , as so far , we still know little about the nature of current accelerated expansion . in general , from the phenomenological points of view , the possible models can be classified by the form of friedmann equation .",
    "one is @xmath7 where the extra energy component(s ) is(are ) added on the right hand of einstein s equations , and @xmath8 is a function of energy density @xmath9 which can be composed from dark matter and extra energy components . here",
    "@xmath10 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the other is @xmath11 where the energy component(s ) is ( are ) invariant and the _ gravity theory _ or equivalently the relation of hubble parameter @xmath10 with the conventional matter ( dark matter at late time ) can be altered , @xmath12 is a function of @xmath13 or @xmath10 . for recent reviews about dark energy and an accelerated expansion universe ,",
    "please see @xcite .    in this paper , we will consider a leading modified gravity model , dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) brane model @xcite , for the review",
    ", please see @xcite .",
    "in dgp brane model , a tensionless four - dimensional brane ( a hypersurface with a vanishing cosmological constant ) is embedded in a five dimensional bulk which is a flat minkowski space - time , where the gauge forces are confined on the brane and gravity can propagate in all dimensions freely . below the crossover scale @xmath14 , the gravity appears four - dimensional .",
    "however , above the scale @xmath14 the gravity can leak into the extra dimension and make the conventional four - dimensional gravity altered .",
    "it is due to the leakage of gravity , the current universe appears an accelerated expansion phase .    in the past years",
    ", the dgp model has been constrained by cosmic observational data sets , for recent constrained results , please see @xcite in geometrical side and @xcite in dynamical side .",
    "importantly , lombriser _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite constrained dgp brane model exhaustively by adopting a parameterized post - friedmann description of gravity , where all of the cmb data , including the largest scales , and its correlation with galaxies in addition to the geometrical constraints from supernovae distances and the hubble constant were utilized .",
    "of course , it is more important and necessary to constrain a cosmological model by using all of cmb data and its correlation with large scale structure , say galaxy .",
    "however , it is much complicated when we have to resort to some kinds of boltzmann - codes , say the famous * cmbfast * and * camb*. it would be interesting , if this complication is avoided , and a relative stronger prediction is arrived . in this paper , we will investigate this kind of possibility by combining the geometrical and dynamical perspectives without the above mentioned complication . via this combination ,",
    "the constraint becomes much tight and efficient because it relies on both gravity theory and background geometry . on the geometrical side",
    ", we will consider the luminosity - distance relation of sn and grb , the standard rulers from bao , x - ray gas fraction and cmb , also the lookback time of high redshift galaxy .",
    "for the dynamical perspective , we mainly consider the growth function @xmath15 of the linear matter density contrast as a function of redshift .",
    "as well known , the data points of growth function were obtained with the help of @xmath4cdm model and the reliability will be reduced when it is used to constrain other cosmological models , however this problem can be evaded in the dgp model if it has similar expansion history to that of @xmath4cdm @xcite .",
    "in fact , the use of redshift - distance relation of @xmath4cdm ( with @xmath16 for the data point at @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the remained five data points ) makes the the data points of growth function weak to constrain other cosmological model @xcite . in @xcite , to use these data points to find the growth index of dgp model , the dgp model parameters were selected properly to make redshift - distance relation be the same as that of @xmath4cdm model .",
    "in fact , we can firstly neglect this weak point and just use these data points as dynamical constraint beyond @xmath4cdm model .",
    "after it was done , we can check the consistence via investigating the possible departure from @xmath4cdm model with the best fit values of model parameters .",
    "if the departure is large , the data points must be discarded and the data fitting is not reliable .",
    "in fact , one will find that the redshift - distance relations of @xmath4cdm and dgp model are almost the same and the relative departure from @xmath4cdm model is up to @xmath19 in terms of @xmath20 when @xmath21 varies in the range @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath18 is fixed in @xmath4cdm model .",
    "when the values of @xmath21 increase , the relative departure becomes small . and the departure is smaller than the errors of growth function data points .",
    "based on this point , the data points of growth function can be used safely to constrain dgp model . also , when the data points of growth function are used to confront other cosmological models , the consistence must be checked .    for the dgp model ,",
    "the modified friedmann equation is given as @xcite @xmath23 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the so - called crossover scale , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are four- and five - dimensional reduced planck mass respectively , @xmath9 is the cosmological fluid which includes conventional matter contents and radiation , @xmath27 is three dimensional spatial curvature factor . in terms of the dimensionless density parameters ,",
    "the friedmann equation can be rewritten as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a constant which respects to the constraint equation @xmath31 for the spatially flat case ( @xmath32 ) , the above equation reduces to @xmath33 .",
    "in our calculations , we have taken the total likelihood function @xmath34 to be the products of the separate likelihoods of sn ( with and without systematic errors ) , bao , cmb , grbs , cbf , lt and gf",
    ". then we get @xmath35 @xmath36 where the separate likelihoods of sn , bao , cmb , grbs , cbf , lt , gf and the current observational datasets used in this paper are shown in the appendix [ app : obervations ] .    in our analysis",
    ", we perform a global fitting to determine the cosmological parameters using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the mcmc method is based on the publicly available * cosmomc * package @xcite and the * modified cosmomc * package @xcite , including the x - ray cluster gas mass fraction . for our models",
    "we have modified these packages to add some subroutines , for example the code calculating the growth function likelihood etc .",
    "the following basic cosmological parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) are varying with top - hat priors : the physical baryon density @xmath39 $ ] , the physical dark matter energy density @xmath40 $ ] . and ,",
    "in the data fitting process another seven parameters ( @xmath41 ) included in the x - ray gas mass fraction @xmath42 are treated as free parameters . as a byproduct the best fitting values of these parameters are obtained . and , these values",
    "can also be taken accounted as a check of data fitting .    from the observational results listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : fobs ] , one has noticed that the datum at @xmath43 is odd in some degree for its value is above @xmath44 .",
    "so in data fitting process , we have considered two cases with and without inclusion of @xmath43 data point .",
    "the constrained results are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dgp ] ( with sn systematic errors ) . from tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] , one can easily see that the value of @xmath45 is smaller and the constraint is tighter without @xmath43 data point than that with it . under this status",
    ", one would constrain a cosmological model without the inclusion of @xmath43 data point . for the non - flat dgp model , we summarize the model parameters",

    "[ tab : resultsnonflat ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dgpnonflat ] ( with sn systematic errors ) . as a comparison , using the same combination ( with sn systematic errors ) to the flat @xmath4cdm model , we have the results @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "one can see that the best fit values of @xmath21 and @xmath49 errors of model parameters are enlarged when sn systematic errors are included . as contrasts , the current hubble values and @xmath45 are lower in the case of sn systematic errors included .",
