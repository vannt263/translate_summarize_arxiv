    "surface tension of ionic solutions strongly depends on their salt composition and , in general , increases with ionic strength for low salt concentrations  @xcite .",
    "wagner  @xcite was the first to connect this finding with the dielectric discontinuity at the air / water interface , suggesting that dielectric image charge interactions could explain the increase in surface tension .",
    "this suggestion was implemented in the pioneering work of onsager and samaras ( os ) , who used the debye  hckel theory for electrolytes  @xcite .",
    "the os result presents a universal limiting law for the excess surface tension .",
    "it depends on the dielectric mismatch at the interface and on the bulk salt concentration  @xcite , and implies that the increase in the surface tension would be independent of the ion type .",
    "this simplified observation , however , turned out to be violated in many experimental situations  @xcite , and led over the years to numerous investigations of non - electrostatic _ ion - specific _ interactions between ions and surfaces  @xcite , and their role in modifying the surface tension of ionic solutions  @xcite .    in fact , ion - specific effects date back to the late 19th century , when hofmeister  @xcite measured the amount of protein precipitation from solution in presence of various salts , and found a universal series of ionic activity . the same _",
    "hofmeister series _ emerges in a large variety of experiments in chemical and biological systems  @xcite . among others",
    ", they include forces between mica or silica surfaces  @xcite , osmotic pressure in the presence of ( bio)macromolecules  @xcite , and more specifically , measurements of surface tension at the air / water and oil / water interfaces  @xcite . for simple monovalent salts , the surface tension ( in particular at the air / water interface )",
    "was experimentally found  @xcite to depend strongly on the type of anion , while the dependence on the cation type is much weaker .",
    "this finding is consistent with the fact that anion concentration at the air / water interface exceeds that of cations .",
    "furthermore , for halides  @xcite , the lighter ions lead to a larger excess in surface tension in a sequence that precisely corresponds to the _ reverse _ of the hofmeister series .",
    "discrepancies between the os predictions and the observed ion - specific surface tension motivated numerous attempts to modify the original os model . here",
    ", we limit ourselves to briefly review some of the more recent works on surface tension of ionic solutions  @xcite , which are directly related to the present study .",
    "dean and horgan  @xcite calculated the surface tension of ionic solutions to first order in a systematic cumulant expansion , where the zeroth order is equivalent to the debye - hckel ( dh ) linear theory  @xcite .",
    "the specific ion - surface interactions are modeled via an ionic exclusion ( stern ) layer of finite thickness .",
    "thus , the interaction of ions with the interface contains only a length scale without any energy scale .",
    "this model is solved via a formal field - theoretic representation of the partition function .",
    "the os result is reproduced exactly , and ion - specific effects are described in terms of the thickness of the salt - exclusion layer . in",
    "yet a separate study by the same authors  @xcite , a system of two interacting surfaces including a cation - specific short - range surface interaction was addressed .",
    "the consequences of this cation - specific interaction on determining the effective charge , as well as the disjoining pressure as a function of the separation between the surfaces were studied in detail .    in a series of papers levin and coworkers  @xcite calculated the solvation free - energy of polarizable ions at air / water and oil / water interfaces .",
    "their mean - field theory ( mft ) modifies the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory by adding an ion - surface interaction potential .",
    "the modified potential is based on several ion - surface interaction terms that are added in an _ ad hoc _ way to the pb equation .",
    "these interactions include the image charge interaction , stern exclusion layer , ionic cavitation energy and ionic polarizability . while the additional interaction terms may represent some physical mechanisms for ion - specific interaction with the surface , one can not , in general , simply add such terms to the mft potential in a self - consistent way .",
    "these terms , which are sometimes mutually exclusive , are neither completely independent nor can they be obtained from a mft formulation  @xcite .",
    "computing numerically the surface tension for an homologous series of sodium salts , levin and co - workers fitted their predictions to the hofmeister series .",
    "they used the hydrated size of the sodium ion as a single fit parameter .",
    "furthermore , the surface tension at the oil / water interface was fitted for another series of potassium salts  @xcite . in order to apply their theory to the different interface , a second fit parameter",
    "was used to account for the dispersion forces at the oil / water interface .",
    "a different line of reasoning was initiated by netz and coworkers  @xcite , who calculated the surface tension for both charged and neutral surfaces using a two - scale ( atomistic and continuum ) modeling approach .",
    "explicit solvent - atomistic molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations furnished non - electrostatic ion - specific potentials of mean force .",
    "these interaction potentials were then added to the pb theory that provides the electrostatic part of the potential of mean force . within this framework , netz and coworkers were able to show that the polarity of the surface may reverse the order of the hofmeister series .",
    "the fitted results agree well with experiments performed on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces .",
    "although many works  @xcite tried to generalize the seminal os theory , it nevertheless remains largely misunderstood what is the accurate theoretical framework of the os theory .",
    "the os theory makes use of the ( linearized ) pb equation in the presence of a planar dielectric boundary , to obtain the one - dimensional image charge potential of mean force , [ see eq .",
    "( 4 ) in ref .  ] .",
    "it should be stated that the latter is _ not _ a solution of the one - dimensional pb equation .",
    "in fact , the pb solution can not describe any image charge effects on its own .",
    "this subtle , yet essential point , gets often irreparably lost when generalizations of the os theory are attempted based on elaborate decorations of the pb equation itself .    if the os theory is not simply a redressed version of the pb theory , then what exactly is the relation between them ?",
    "while the os theory can not be obtained from the mean - field theory , it is deduced from the thermodynamic fluctuations of the instantaneous electric fields around the pb solution  @xcite .",
    "the free energy is expanded in a loop expansion and only the one - loop correction to the mft result is retained .    while the detailed formal derivation ( as shown below ) is complex , we believe that its physical basis is quite simple and straightforward .",
    "the os result does not generalize the pb equation to include image charge effects at an interface between two dielectric media , but rather it solves the problem on a higher level of approximation by going beyond the mft level .",
    "we consider this conceptual clarification to have large importance on generalizations of the os theory itself .    in this paper",
    "we introduce two important modifications , relevant to the calculations of the surface tension of electrolytes .",
    "first , we demonstrate that the os contribution is effectively fluctuational in nature , and follows from the one - loop expansion of the coulomb partition function around the mean - field solution .",
    "second , we propose a phenomenological approach that consistently describes ion - interface interactions in the form of a coupling term in the free energy .",
    "this new formulation allows us to obtain a simple analytical theory that reunites the os pioneering result , which does not agree with experimental data , with the ionic specificity of the hofmeister series .",
    "we take ionic specificity into account through the ionic size and an ion - surface interaction .",
    "each ionic species is characterized by a phenomenological adhesivity parameter  @xcite .",
    "specifically , short - range non - electrostatic effects such as the ion chemical nature , size and polarizability , as well as the preferential ion - solvent interaction  @xcite , are introduced by adding one phenomenological parameter to the free energy .",
    "this allows us to obtain a modified pb mean - field theory and to evaluate the contribution of fluctuations ( beyond mean - field ) to the surface tension .",
    "the latter includes the dielectric image charge effects ( os ) , as well as the couplings between image charge effects and surface - specific interactions .",
    "our analytical surface tension prediction fits well a variety of interfacial tension data at the air / water and oil / water interfaces .",
    "using one fit parameter per electrolyte it reproduces the reversed hofmeister series for several types of monovalent anions .",

    "another possible origin for the adhesivity is the cavitational energy  @xcite .",
    "the ion interferes with the water structure by breaking hydrogen bonds .",
    "this costs energy , leading to an effective attraction of the ion to the interface .",
    "other effects such as the ion polarizability  @xcite or dispersion forces  @xcite might also play a role in the ion - surface interaction .",

    "<S> we derive analytically the surface - tension dependence on the ionic strength , ionic size and ion - surface interaction , and show consequently that the onsager - samaras result is consistent with the one - loop correction beyond the mean - field result . </S>",
    "<S> our theory fits well a wide range of salt concentrations for different monovalent ions using one fit parameter per electrolyte , and reproduces the reverse hofmeister series for anions at the air / water and oil / water interfaces . </S>"
