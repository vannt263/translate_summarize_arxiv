    "<S> the 1d regime , however , is not subject to these instabilities . </S>",

    "<S> the dispersive shock solution is similar to that observed in bec theoretical and experimental studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key physical difference after filtering is the distinct center bulge created in the dissipative problem . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersive solution , on the other hand , forms a smooth , expanding well between the two constant states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the one - dimensional collision problem provides a clear distinction between dissipative and dispersive regularizations .    </S>",

    "<S> we know that bec is regularized by dispersion , yet a bulge is still produced . </S>",
    "<S> one possible interpretation is that the proliferation of quantized vortices and quantum turbulence in the fully 3d case yields an effective viscosity for the larger scale dynamics , even though the underlying model is dissipationless . similarly , fully 3d experiments in a ufg may not provide a definitive determination of the underlying hydrodynamic regularization mechanism unless imaging resolution is significantly improved . </S>",
