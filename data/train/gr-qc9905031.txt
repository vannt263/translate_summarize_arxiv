    "there appear to be deep connections between phenomena at the microscopic quantum level and those at the macroscopic level described by general relativity .",
    "these connections were first elucidated by studies of quantum field theory in the classical curved spacetime of general relativity , particularly those involving particle creation by strong gravitational fields , such as exist in the early universe and near black holes @xcite .",
    "the framework of quantum field theory in the classical curved spacetime of general relativity appears to be quite robust , and is the one we employ in our present study .",
    "we are particularly concerned with certain non - perturbative gravitational contributions to the vacuum energy of quantized fields @xcite .",
    "we show that these contributions may account for the recent observations @xcite of type - ia supernovae ( sne - ia ) that seem to imply that there is an acceleration of the recent expansion of the universe . in our model ,",
    "the key new ingredient needed to account for the observations is the existence of a particle having a very small mass of about @xmath1 ev .",
    "this could be a scalar particle or one of higher spin , such as a graviton .",
    "it is well - known that in a robertson - walker universe , the linearized einstein equations obeyed by the graviton field take the same form ( for each polarization in the lifshitz gauge ) as the equation of a minimally coupled massless scalar field @xcite .",
    "inclusion of a mass of about @xmath1 ev in these equations would give effects similar to the ones studied here , and would evidently not conflict with other observations .",
    "we consider a scalar field for simplicity .",
    "the effects we investigate stem from the discovery @xcite that a covariant infinite series of terms in the propagators of quantum fields in curved spacetime can be summed in closed form , to all orders in the curvature .",
    "the summed infinite series of terms are _ all _ those that involve at least one factor of the scalar curvature , r , ( together with any number of factors of the riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives ) in the schwinger - dewitt proper - time series for the propagator",
    ". we will refer to this partially - summed form of the propagator as the r - summed form of the propagator .",
    "although only the first several terms in the proper - time series have been calculated ( because of their complexity ) , the r - summed form can be derived by means of mathematical induction @xcite .",
    "a further reason to expect the r - summed form of the propagator to contain information of physical significance , is that the leading term in the r - summed form of the propagator follows directly from the feynman path - integral expression for the propagator by means of a gaussian integration about the dominant path @xcite .",
    "our results flow from the effective action that is obtained from the r - summed form of the propagator .",
    "we leave for a later paper , the contribution of these non - perturbative gravitational effects to early inflation at the grand - unified scale and associated particle creation . in this paper",
    ", we focus on possible consequences of these non - perturbative terms in the effective action that may be observed today . as noted earlier , we find that these non - perturbative effects in the presence of an ultralight particle having a mass of about @xmath1 ev , give a good fit to the observed sne - ia data points .",
    "the effective action of our model has a single free parameter determined by the mass of the particle and its curvature coupling constant . in addition , there are two more parameters which characterize the solutions to the effective gravitational field equations .",
    "these can be taken to be the present hubble constant and the present matter density .",
    "the hubble constant is determined by low redshift measurements as usual .",
    "the mass of the particle , and the present matter density are given by a fit to the sne - ia data .",
    "the age of the universe , and the cosmic time , or red - shift , at which the non - perturbative contributions of the ultralight particle first become significant , follow from these parameters .",
    "our model involves a renormalizable free field theory in curved spacetime , and apart from the supposed existence of an ultralight mass , is based on previously discovered non - perturbative terms .",
    "furthermore , it requires no cosmological constant in the usual sense of the term ; and no fine - tuning of the value of the current cosmic time is necessary to explain the current observed value of the matter density .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we calculate , by zeta - function regularization , the renormalized effective action that follows from the r - summed propagator . this confirms the result found with dimensional regularization by parker and toms @xcite , and generalizes it to include the case when there is an imaginary part of the effective action .",
    "variation of this effective action gives the einstein gravitational field equations , including vacuum contributions of quantized fields .",
    "in addition , an imaginary part of the effective action implies a rate of particle creation in the same way as it does in quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the effective action has infrared - type divergences which are treated separately in appendix a.    the effective action at low curvatures gives rise to induced gravitational coupling constants , as is well - known .",
    "these constants depend on a renormalization scale parameter . in section iii",
    ", we consider the dependence of the induced gravitational constants on the renormalization scale , and identify the renormalized constants with their known values at low curvature .",
    "this identification is used to fix all the coupling constants in the effective action , in terms of their low curvature values , except the field mass @xmath4 and its curvature coupling @xmath5 . in this context , the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite are explored in greater detail and generalized here .",
    "variations of various terms in the effective action are listed in appendix b.    in section iv , we clarify the meaning of exact and perturbative solutions to the semiclassical einstein equations .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that a perturbative treatment in @xmath6 must be done in such a way that only genuine quantum corrections are treated in a perturbative manner , while factors of @xmath6 which occur in the `` classical '' klein - gordon action are not treated perturbatively .    in section",
    "v , we display a set of constant curvature ( de sitter ) solutions , which exist even in the absence of an explicit cosmological constant term in the effective action .",
    "we show that , for @xmath7 , such solutions typically have planckian curvatures and are therefore not of much physical interest . on the other hand , for @xmath8",
    ", we show that there exist de sitter solutions with scalar curvature approximately equal to @xmath9 , and that such solutions exist for a wide range of values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "as argued in later sections , these solutions could play a vital role at the present time , if there exists an ultralight particle with @xmath8 . in section",
    "vi , we carry out perturbative calculations of the scalar curvature about a classical robertson - walker universe , containing classical matter and radiation .",
    "we find that quantum corrections to the classical scalar curvature of the universe can become significant at an epoch determined by the mass scale @xmath10 , for @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , we find that the quantum corrections tend to drive the scalar curvature to a constant value .",
    "these considerations lead to a scenario , presented in section vii , in which quantum corrections to a matter - dominated universe cause a transition to a de sitter solution of the type discussed in section v. the various cosmological parameters in such a model universe are expressed in terms of three basic parameters to be determined by observation : the mass scale @xmath12 , the present ratio of matter density to critical density @xmath13 , and the present hubble constant @xmath14 .    in section viii , we develop this scenario further , using it to obtain magnitude - redshift curves , and comparing these curves to recent data from high - redshift type 1a supernovae @xcite .",
    "the mass scale @xmath12 is determined to be roughly equal to @xmath1 ev , while @xmath13 is found to be less than @xmath15 . in section ix",
    ", we derive from these parameters the age of the universe in our model , which is found to be greater than about @xmath3 gyr .",
    "finally , in section ix , we conclude with a discussion of our results and comment on future work .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized in eqs .",

    "here we derive the regularized effective action based on the propagator for a scalar field in curved space .",
    "parker and toms @xcite define the effective action via dimensional regularization of the feynman green function and by integrating the green function with respect to the square of the mass . here",
    "we will define it by zeta - function regularization .    to this end , consider a @xmath18-dimensional scalar field theory in curved spacetime , with classical action s= -d^d x ( x ) h(x ) ( x ) , where @xmath19 , and we have ignored boundary contributions .",
    "the one - loop effective action , @xmath20 , is defined by the functional integral [ def ] e^iw^1 z = de^is , and is related to the transition amplitude for evolution from the `` in '' vacuum state at early times to the `` out '' vacuum state at late times @xcite : e^iw^1 = 0_out0_in . for free fields , as considered here , the one - loop effective action , @xmath20 , gives the _ full _ quantum contributions of the matter field to the effective action . by formally performing the functional integral in eq .",

    "such solutions must therefore be regarded as physical solutions .    for these reasons",
    ", we believe that exact solutions that do not arise from perturbative reduction must be included in a complete analysis of solutions of the semiclassical einstein equations , at least when a mass scale is present in the theory .",
