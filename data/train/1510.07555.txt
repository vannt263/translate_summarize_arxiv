    "we use this spectral information and damping rate to retrieve @xmath2 and the size of a nanodiamond .    in the regime where the oscillation amplitude of a trapped particle is small ,",
    "the trapping potential of an optical tweezer can be approximated as harmonic @xcite . under this condition",
    ", the motion of a levitated object can be expressed as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the displacement of a trapped particle from the center of the trap along the @xmath14-axis .",

    "@xmath19 is a gaussian random force exerted by the gas molecules on a trapped particle with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath23 is the cm temperature of a trapped particle , and @xmath24 is the dirac delta function @xcite .",
    "similar analyses for the remaining two axes are also valid . after performing a fourier transform and rearrangement , the power spectral density ( psd ) of ( [ eqn1 ] ) can be written as    @xmath25    we fit ( [ eq2 ] ) with the experimental data .",
    "figure [ fig1]b shows the psds corresponding to the measured voltage signals from a levitated nanodiamond for different trapping powers along with the respective fits ( solid lines ) of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) at @xmath26 mb . for the purpose of comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b we have also included the relevant theoretical psds ( dashed gray lines ) . in plotting the theoretical psds we have assumed that all parameters are identical to the measured psds except @xmath23 which has been taken equal to @xmath27 k. figure [ fig1]c demonstrates the measured damping rate as a function of pressure at a constant trapping power of @xmath28 mw .",
    "later , we use this damping rate to find the size of a nanoparticle .",
    "to study the behavior of diamond below atmospheric pressure , after levitating a nanodiamond with the minimum possible trapping power ( @xmath28 mw ) , we gradually take it to different levels of vacuum whilst continuously monitoring its scattering intensity ( size ) using a camera .",
    "figure [ fig2]a shows a typical plot of scattering intensity versus pressure ( pink circles ) from a levitated nanodiamond ( for more data points see supplementary information ) . it can be observed that as we evacuate the trapping chamber , the scattering intensity diminishes : a levitated nanodiamond shrinks in size as the pressure is reduced .",
    "we attribute this reduction in size to the removal of physisorbed water and organic substances such as the carboxyl groups ( nanodiamonds as obtained from the supplier are in water and are coated with carboxyl groups for stabilization ) present on the surface of nanodiamonds down to @xmath26 mb where the temperature reaches @xmath29 k ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "physisorbed water and organic impurities normally disappear@xcite at or below @xmath30 k. this is further confirmed when we keep a levitated nanodiamond in a vacuum of less than @xmath10 mb for an extended period of time ( about an hour ) and take it to back to atmospheric pressure ( red squares in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) and bring it down to the low pressures again .",
    "in the second round of evacuation , the scattering intensity remains constant down to @xmath10 mb .",
    "this unaltered scattering intensity in the second round of evacuation indicates the absence of substances which evaporate / burn at relatively lower temperatures .",
    "the reduction in size below @xmath26 mb is attributed to the burning of amorphous carbon or diamond .",
    "amorphous carbon is generally found as an outer layer on the surface of nanodiamonds @xcite .",
    "the burning temperature of amorphous carbon @xcite at atmospheric pressure varies between @xmath31 k - @xmath32 k while the oxidation temperature of nanodiamonds@xcite ranges from @xmath32 k to @xmath33 k. also , the exact oxidation temperature of nanodiamonds depend on the surface quality , the crystallographic faces , and the densities of impurities in nanodiamonds @xcite . to confirm the presence of amorphous carbon as well as diamond in the nanoparticles that we have used in our experiments",
    ", we performed raman spectroscopy using a @xmath34 nm laser . at this wavelength amorphous",
    "carbon is more sensitive than diamond @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2]b presents the relevant data .",
    "this figure clearly shows the presence of amorphous carbon and diamond peaked at @xmath35 @xmath36 and at @xmath37 @xmath36 , respectively @xcite given that amorphous carbon is a strongly absorbing material @xcite , trapping light ( @xmath11 nm ) absorption and hence raised @xmath2 and consequent burning in an air environment is highly probable .",
    "this burning of nanodiamond in air can potentially be a major hurdle in applications where vacuum is inevitable .",
    "based on the idea that an oxygen - less environment may be a cure to this problem , we have studied the behavior of levitated nanodiamonds in a nitrogen environment .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a as blue crosses for a constant trapping power of @xmath27 mw .",
    "it can be observed that at pressures @xmath38 mb the scattering intensity hence the size of a nanodiamond remains unchanged ; even though temperature is quite high ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that for burning to occur , a nanodiamond requires oxygen which is absent in a nitrogen rich environment .",
    "however , if the pressure is reduced below @xmath10 mb , the scattering intensity of the nanodiamond gradually diminishes .",
    "given that there is almost no oxygen in the chamber and the reduced pressure means less cooling due to gas molecules and hence higher internal temperature , we believe this is the onset of graphitization of the nanodiamond . at atmospheric pressure graphitization of nanodiamonds",
    "starts in the temperature range @xmath39 k and depends on the surface quality of nanodiamonds @xcite .",

    "solid blue and green lines represent linear fits.,width=321 ]",
    "to verify that a levitated nanodiamond reaches such high temperatures in moderate levels of vacuum , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present @xmath2 obtained from the same nanodiamond used in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of trapping power in air ( blue circles ) at @xmath26 mb . in measuring @xmath2",
    "we have assumed that a levitated nanodiamond is at room temperature at @xmath40 mb .",
    "also , since fitting uncertainties increase with the increasing pressure , @xmath2 has been plotted as a function of trapping power at a constant pressure and it was measured during the @xmath41 round of evacuation at which a levitated nanodiamond maintains its size .",
    "constancy in size / mass is a requirement of the psd analysis . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] one can see that the internal temperature reaches @xmath42 k at @xmath43 mw of trapping power in air .",
    "this is well within the reported burning temperature of amorphous carbon or diamond @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have also included @xmath2s obtained from a levitated nanodiamond submerged in a nitrogen environment . in this case",
    "@xmath2 reaches approximately @xmath44 k at the maximum trapping power . at pressures below @xmath26 mb",
    ", temperatures are expected to be higher given that the cooling due to gas molecules becomes less effective while the absorption remains constant .",
    "it is noteworthy that the fluorescence from nv@xmath0 centers in diamond decreases significantly at temperatures beyond @xmath45 k and by @xmath46 k it reduces to @xmath47 of the room temperature value @xcite . also , at @xmath48 k , nv@xmath0 center s fluorescence lifetime and the contrast between electron spin resonances reduce below @xmath47 of the room temperature value @xcite . at a temperature above @xmath49",
    "k , the spin coherence time of the nv@xmath0 center decreases as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the highest temperature that we have measured here , using trapping powers higher than those have been used by neukirch et al .",
    "@xcite , rules out the possibility of melting diamond as suggested in ref .",
    "diamond usually melts at temperatures @xmath51 k and requires pressure above atmospheric pressure @xcite . a slight difference between the temperatures at a constant power such as at @xmath27 mw in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] between different environments can be attributed to the variation in surface qualities and the densities of impurities in different nanodiamonds @xcite .",
    "additionally , it has been demonstrated that bigger particles heat up rapidly compared to smaller particles under the same experimental conditions @xcite . as a result ,",
    "variation in the internal temperatures is expected unless all the attributes of different particles are identical . however , due to the inherent nature of levitated experiments , it is difficult to levitate particles with the same attributes in different runs of an experiment .",
    "this is further worsened by the polydispersity of nanoparticles .",
    "for example , the average size of the nanodiamonds that we have used in our experiment is quoted to be @xmath8 nm by the manufacturer . a representative scanning electron microscope ( sem )",
    "image of this nanodiamond is shown in fig .",
    "nanodiamonds from a few tens of nanometers to a few hundred nanometers are visible . consequently",
    ", trapping different sizes of nanodiamonds in different runs of an experiment is possible .",
    "nevertheless , to be consistent throughout the experiment , we levitate nanodiamonds of similar size by monitoring their scattering intensities . also , next we present a way of determining the size of an individual levitated object from the measured damping rate ( @xmath16 ) that it encounters while oscillating inside the trap . for the purpose of following calculations",
    ", we assume that a levitated nanodiamond is of spherical shape .",
    "the effective damping rate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c can be expressed as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the damping rates due to the impinging and emerging gas molecules , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 can be written as @xmath55 while @xmath54 is related to @xmath53 by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the radius of a trapped particle , the number density of gas molecules at pressure @xmath61 , molecular mass , and the mean thermal velocity of impinging gas molecules , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 can further be expressed as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number of gas molecules per cubic meter at atmospheric conditions and @xmath64 is the atmospheric pressure . on substitutions of various terms",
    ", one can express @xmath57 as    @xmath65    where @xmath15 has been expressed as @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the mass density of diamond .",
    "given that the levitated nanodiamonds burn , equation ( [ eq18 ] ) gives the ultimate size of a nanodiamond for which we previously found temperatures .",
    "that is , it is the size of the nanodiamond after the first round of evacuation .",
    "the actual size of a nanodiamond before burning can be found using scattering theory .",

    "[ fig2]b ) at different pressures , we can find the actual size of a nanodiamond using equation ( [ eq22 ] ) :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the radius and the scattering intensity of the particle at pressure @xmath61 , respectively .    as examples , using the model developed here",
    ", we estimate the sizes of the nanodiamonds for which we have presented internal temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . using equations ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) , and parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 k , @xmath77 k , @xmath78 kg/@xmath79 , @xmath80 kg , @xmath81 mb and @xmath82 radian with the minimum trapping power of @xmath28 mw , fig .",
    "[ fig5]b shows the radius of the trapped nanodiamond at various pressures in air .",
    "it can be observed that when the nanodiamond was initially trapped at atmospheric pressure , its diameter was @xmath83 nm .",
    "similarly , for the nitrogen case using the same parameters except @xmath84 radian and @xmath85 k , we get the ultimate diameter of the nanodiamond is @xmath86 nm . given the uncertainty in the shape of nanodiamonds as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , the nanodiamonds that we have used to find @xmath2s in air and nitrogen ambients are of similar size .",
    "this is also in good agreement with the technique ( initial scattering intensities ) that we have utilized to trap similar size nanodiamonds in different runs of an experiment .",
    "furthermore , even though the actual dimensions of a nanodiamond will be different from @xmath57 due to its asymmetric shape , the estimated size provided by our model is well within the distribution visible in the sem image ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",
    "lastly , we believe that the method developed here for the determination of size of an individual particle can be used in any levitated experiment .",
    "we have demonstrated that nanodiamonds burn in air while they graphitize in a nitrogen ambient by absorbing trapping laser ( @xmath11 nm ) light as the cooling due to gas molecules becomes less effective with decreasing pressure .",
    "we believe that amorphous carbon , a strongly absorbing material , present on the surface of nanodiamonds is a key reason for this .",
    "we also think that purer nanodiamonds instead of the currently available hpht synthesized nanodiamonds can be a cure to this problem .",
    "our brownian motion based analysis has shown that the internal temperature of a levitated nanodiamond can reach up to @xmath44 k. this rules out the possibility of melting diamond which requires @xcite a temperature @xmath51 k.",
    "lastly , exploiting the damping rate that a particle encounters while in motion , we have developed a new way of determining its size .",
    "we consider that this new technique will be useful in present and future levitated experiments where the traditional electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering based size determinations are not suitable .",
    "nanodiamonds containing @xmath7 nv@xmath0 centres ( nd - nv-@xmath8 nm ) were bought from adamas nanotechnology inc , usa . the average size of the nanodiamonds quoted by the manufacturer is @xmath8 nm . to prevent agglomeration",

    "the trapping chamber is continuously monitored by a cmos camera ( thorlabs inc ) .",
    "once a nanodiamond is trapped , the trapping chamber is evacuated to study the behaviour of nanodiamonds in vacuum .",
