    "recent observations by @xcite have shown that the lyman-@xmath0 forest is polluted with metals at very low densities .",
    "the distribution of metal is very strongly dependent on overdensity , with median metallicity values ranging from @xmath12 = -4.0 $ ] at log  @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is defined as ( @xmath15 ) to @xmath12 = -2.5 $ ] at log  @xmath16 using their fiducial uv background model .",
    "their observations show little evidence for metallicity evolution of the lyman-@xmath0 forest over the redshift range @xmath17 .",
    "the lack of observed evolution in metallicity is suggestive of a very early epoch of stellar evolution .",
    "recent observations by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe suggest an epoch of star formation in the redshift range of @xmath18 @xcite , which is consistent with the simulation results of @xcite and @xcite , which suggest that the first generation of stars ( known as population iii , or pop iii ) formed in the redshift range @xmath19 .",
    "the abel et al . results , which are the highest - resolution simulations of formation of the first generation of primordial stars to date , also suggest that pop iii stars are very massive - on the order of @xmath20 .",
    "stars that are in this mass range will die in extremely energetic pair - instability supernovae and can eject up to 57 m@xmath21 of @xmath22ni .",
    "the formation site of pop iii stars is in halos with total masses of @xmath23 .",
    "these halos have escape velocities which are on the order of 1 km / s . due to the shallowness of the potential wells that pop iii stars form in",
    ", @xcite suggests that ejecta from a massive pop iii supernova can propagate to very large distances ( far greater than the halo virial radius ) , a result which is supported in simulations performed by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe the results of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations which address whether or not a population of massive primordial stars can be responsible for metal enrichment of the lyman-@xmath0 forest to the level and dispersion seen today .",
    "we examine the most optimistic possible scenario for pop iii star formation and enrichment in order to establish an upper limit on metal enrichment of the lyman-@xmath0 forest due to population iii stars .",
    "the simulations were set up using the concordance cosmological model ( @xmath24,@xmath25 , @xmath26 and a hubble parameter of @xmath27 where h is in units of 100 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 .",
    "initial perturbations in the dark matter and baryon density were created with an @xcite power spectrum with @xmath29 and @xmath30 using the zeldovich approximation @xcite in a box which is 0.7 @xmath31 comoving mpc on a side . in our simulations",
    "we use a computational box with @xmath32 grid cells with a comoving spatial resolution of @xmath33 kpc and a dark matter mass resolution of 1477 @xmath31 @xmath34 .",
    "the simulation was initialized at z=99 and was allowed to evolve to z=15 using the eulerian adaptive mesh refinement code enzo @xcite .",
    "the simulation was stopped at @xmath35 and all halos with dark matter mass m@xmath36 m@xmath21 were found using the hop halo - finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "this yielded 184 halos , each of which we assume produces one pair instability supernova .",
    "note that we are ignoring negative feedback , which raises the minimum halo mass which can form pop iii stars @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our desire to simulate a best - case scenario .",
    "we discuss this and other assumptions in section  [ discussion ] .    at this point ,",
    "two separate cases are considered . in the first case ( referred to as case ` a ' ) , spheres of uniform metal density 1 kpc ( proper ) in radius with 127 @xmath34 of metal are placed in the simulation , centered on the cell of highest dark matter density of each halo .",
    "this corresponds to a mass averaged metallicity in the volume of @xmath37 @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are total metal and baryon masses in the simulation volume ) , which remains constant throughout the simulation .",
    "no other modifications to the data were made  in particular , the baryon density , temperature and peculiar velocities and dark matter density were unmodified .    in the second case ( case ` b ' ) , the spheres of uniform metal density are placed down in the same manner . in addition , the baryon gas in the corresponding volume is smoothed to the cosmic mean ( @xmath41 ) , and the temperature of the baryon gas is set to 10@xmath42 k. this corresponds to the net smoothing and heating of baryons in primordial halos due to pair - instability supernovae .",
    "the mass averaged metallicity in this case is slightly greater , @xmath43 z@xmath21 .",
    "this is due to a small net loss in baryon mass when the densities are smoothed . as in case",
    "a , peculiar velocities and dark matter density are unmodified .    the simulations",
    "are then evolved to z=3 , following the evolution of the gas using non - equilibrium chemistry and cooling from hydrogen and helium and their ions @xcite .",
    "metal line cooling is ignored . at z = 7",
    "we initialize a uniform metagalactic ultraviolet background field @xcite with a slope of @xmath44 that is ramped to a pre - computed value by a redshift of z = 6 .",
    "@xcite determined that such a prescription can reproduce the gunn - peterson effect in the hydrogen ly-@xmath0 lines by a redshift of 5.5 .",
    "self - shielding of the gas is not explicitly included in the assumed uv background .",
    "it is important to note that the box size , at 0.7 h@xmath28 mpc , is somewhat small .",
    "statistical results are reliable at @xmath3 . however , by @xmath5 ( when the simulations are terminated ) the box is too small to be statistically reliable .",
    "we also performed a simulation in eight times the volume at the same mass and spatial resolution ( i.e. @xmath45 cells / particles ) , which gave results indistinguishable from what follows .",
    "nonetheless , all results at late times should be considered qualitative .",
    "the general evolution of our simulation after injection of metal bubbles at @xmath3 is as follows : beginning at @xmath3 , the bubbles of metal track the flow of gas onto and along dark matter filaments .",
    "the competing effects of advection along the filaments and the collapse of filaments during this period essentially cancel out , with little net effect on the fraction of the volume occupied by metal enriched gas ( also referred to as the volume filling factor , or vff ) .",
    "regions of relatively high metallicity ( @xmath46 ) , corresponding to the densest regions of filaments , decrease their volume filling factor significantly from z=15 to z=6 . case a shows more of a decrease in vff at relatively high metallicities ( from a vff of @xmath47 to @xmath48 ) than case b does ( which has a minimum vff of 10@xmath49 ) due to the higher initial densities and lower initial temperatures of polluted regions in case a. figure  [ fig.pic ] shows snapshots of the metal distribution in the simulation volume taken at 4 different redshifts , and figure  [ fig.vff ] shows the volume filling factor for three metallicity thresholds as a function of redshift .    a uniform metagalactic ultraviolet background is switched on at @xmath50 .",
    "photoheating raises the mean temperature of the baryon gas . in the lyman-@xmath0 forest overdensity regime ( @xmath51 ) , which roughly corresponds to the filamentary structure observed in figure  [ fig.pic ] , the temperature is raised to",
    "@xmath52 10,000 k. the local thermal speed of the baryon gas then exceeds the escape velocity of the filaments , resulting in significant expansion of the volume occupied by the gas in those filaments .",
    "this includes the gas polluted by metals .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in the third and fourth panels of figure  [ fig.pic ] .",
    "figure  [ fig.vff ] shows the sharp increase in metal vff in a more quantitative way .",
    "gas which has been polluted above a metallicity of @xmath53 ( corresponding to essentially the entire volume of gas polluted by metals ) increases in vff to 0.048 for both case a and 0.046 for case b. this corresponds to 28% ( 26% ) of the baryon mass being enriched for case a ( case b ) .",
    "the two cases are essentially indistinguishable with regards to the total mass and volume of gas polluted by metals .",
    "examination of gas with higher metallicity ( @xmath46 ) shows some difference between the cases , with a maximum vff of @xmath54 for case a and @xmath55 for case b ( corresponding to 1.5% and 1.9% of the total gas mass , respectively ) .",
    "this difference is due to the initial smoothing and heating of baryons in case b.    in figure  [ fig.c ] we estimate the amount of carbon contained within the primordial metallicity field at @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the carbon abundance in the metal density is equal to @xmath56 , which is taken from the supernovae metal yield of a massive primordial star of approximately 260 @xmath34 as computed by @xcite .",
    "we then compute the mean and median carbon metallity , @xmath12 = $ ] log  @xmath57_{\\odot}$ ] ( where @xmath12_{\\odot}=-3.45 $ ] ) in bins of constant logarithmic overdensity between log  @xmath58 and plot this in panel a of figure  [ fig.c ] . altering the effects of @xmath59 results in this figure",
    "being scaled along the y - axis by a factor of log@xmath60 .",
    "the solid green line is the fit to the observations of @xcite using their fiducial model .",
    "the dashed - green line is the fit of the lower bound lognormal scatter of their data .",
    "the results of our simulation yield that the population iii carbon content in the igm at @xmath5 is below the observed limits across the entire overdensity range .",
    "in panel b of figure  [ fig.c ] we plot the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for both simulation cases in the overdensity range log  @xmath13 to @xmath61 .",
    "the vertical lines correspond to the mean ( solid ) and median ( dashed ) values of the [ c / h ] values .",
    "the distributions corresponding to the two cases are statistically indistinguishable within one standard deviation .",
    "the small variation between the two cases in the range [ c / h]=-4 to -2 is due to the difference in their mean initial metallicity per bubble ( caused by the difference in treatment of of the baryon density field in the region initiallly polluted by metals in the two cases ) .    in order to determine the observability of the primordial metallicity field , we postprocess our data to compute the fraction of civ to neutral hydrogen ( hi ) for each cell in our computational volume . obtaining the quantity @xmath62 within constant overdensity bins , in the range @xmath63 ,",
    "allows the determination of the lognormal average @xmath64 at each redshift . at z=3 our analysis yields @xmath65 for case a  ( b ) .",
    "we can then approximate the civ optical depth due to popiii stars as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the oscillator strengths and rest - frame absorption wavelengths for the two species ( civ & hi ) . using our mean values for @xmath64 at z=3",
    "we obtain an estimated optical depth , due to civ , of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) . @xcite",
    "computed @xmath71 in the ly-@xmath0 forest overdensity range .",
    "if the above value corresponds to the total metallicity at z=3 then the contribution of the primordial component to the total optical depth of civ is about @xmath72 .",
    "this result is somewhat sensitive to the shape of the uv background  see @xcite for more details .",
    "statistical correlations between popiii civ and hi absorbers and more detailed examination of spectra due to ejecta from population iii stars will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this paper we use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to examine the evolution of metals ejected by an early population of massive primordial stars .",
    "we show that , in the absence of further star formation , photoevaporation of baryons bound to dark matter filaments during reionization is the most important mechanism in determining the volume filling fraction by @xmath5 . our two study cases ,",
    "although different in their initial setup , give the same results for the global distribution of the primordial metal field by @xmath5 , suggesting that our result is insensitive to small - scale dynamics .",
    "comparison of our results to observations of carbon in the lyman-@xmath0 forest by @xcite show that at @xmath5 the median value of the pop iii carbon metallicity for both cases considered fall within the low end of the scatter range of the observed data for log  @xmath73 . for log",
    "@xmath74 the population iii carbon metallicity is below the observed values , with the schaye result showing a much stronger increase in metallicity with overdensity , resulting in the median value of @xmath12^{popiii}$ ] becoming an increasingly smaller fraction of the total observed [ c / h ] .",
    "our results depend strongly on two factors , namely , the total number of population iii stars formed in our volume and the metal yield per star . in these simulations",
    "we make the assumption that all halos with mass @xmath75 form a massive primordial star by @xmath3 , which was guided by the simulations performed by @xcite and @xcite , which show that this is the characteristic dark matter mass of a halo which forms a star in the early universe .",
    "simulations by @xcite and semianalytical calculations by @xcite show that a soft uv background produced by the first pop iii stars effectively dissociates @xmath76 , which is the primary cooling mechanism in primordial star formation .",
    "this so - called negative feedback effect raises the minimum halo mass that can form a primordial star within it and therefore reduces the number of halos which will form population iii stars at a given epoch .",
    "@xcite find that negative feedback reduces the number of star forming halos by a factor of 5 - 10 relative to what we used .",
    "on the other hand , suppression of pop iii star formation by negative feedback would be compensated by an extended epoch of pop iii star formation . at present , we do not know when pop iii star formation ceases .",
    "we view our choice of @xmath77 at @xmath3 as a hedge between competing effects .    the decision to place spheres of metal in the simulation volume at @xmath3 was guided primarily by the wmap polarization results .",
    "this choice may have resulted in an underestimation of the number of population iii stars ( and therefore metal pollution due to pop iii supernovae ) because there are dark matter halos which form after @xmath3 but may still be unpolluted by metals .",
    "however , results by @xcite suggest the existence of a `` critical metallicity '' of @xmath78 above which a solar imf dominates , and it has been argued that this metallicity is reached by @xmath79 . @xcite the choice of @xmath3 for our epoch of instantaneous metal enrichment seems to be a reasonable compromise",
    ".    the physical properties of the metal `` bubbles '' can have a possible effect on our results .",
    "the choice of a 1 kpc ( proper ) radius for the metal bubbles is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "several calculations have been performed that suggest that ejecta from the most massive pair - instability supernovae can propagate to large distances @xcite , but the maximum propagation distance is unclear .",
    "additionally , @xcite suggest that the ejecta from pair - instability supernovae still has substantial peculiar velocities ( @xmath80 km / s ) at 500 pc .",
    "the metal spheres in this calculation have no initial outward peculiar velocity , which may result in a smaller volume filling factor than if this were taken into account .    the second factor that strongly affects our result",
    "is the choice of the amount of metals created per population iii supernova .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both suggest that the first population of stars will be very massive .",
    "the mass function of the first generation of stars is unclear , due to lack of resolution and appropriate physics .",
    "the main - sequence mass of the star strongly affects its ultimate fate : stars with the range of @xmath81 detonate in pair instability supernovae , which are much more energetic ( up to @xmath82 ergs compared to 10@xmath83 ergs for a standard type i or type ii supernova ) and produce more metal ( up to 57 m@xmath21 of @xmath22ni and almost 130 m@xmath21 of total metals for a 260 m@xmath21 primordial star ) .",
    "however , stars between @xmath84 and above @xmath85 form black holes without first ejecting significant quantities of nucleosynthesized material . @xcite .",
    "the amount of metals placed into the simulation volume is scalable - if the mean amount of metals ejected by population iii stars were lower ( due to some substantial fraction collapsing directly into black holes , for instance ) , all of the results shown in figure  [ fig.vff ] and panel a of figure  [ fig.c ] scale linearly with the mean amount of metal produced per star .",
    "our results for [ c / h ] vs. overdensity ( using carbon as a proxy for metallicity ) agree with the results of @xcite to within one standard deviation for the lowest observed densities ( log  @xmath86 ) .",
    "these are the densities that are the most likely to remain unpolluted by later generations of stars , which form in deeper potential wells .",
    "further study of the lower density regions of the lyman-@xmath0 forest could yield more constraints on the mass and total number density of massive population iii stars .",
    "an additional factor to consider is that the nucleosynthetic yields of very massive primordial stars are much different than that of metal - enriched stars .",
    "@xcite . due to this , it may be possible to disentangle the effects of massive primordial stars and their metal - polluted descendants , as discussed by @xcite .    due to our choices of low minimum halo mass and high metal yield per supernova ,",
    "our result is a strong upper limit on the pollution of the lyman-@xmath0 forest due to population iii stars , unless we have severely underestimated the duration of the population iii epoch .",
    "the simulation volume is relatively small . though a reasonable statistical representation of the universe at @xmath3 , the results obtained at later times ( @xmath87 ) should be considered qualitative due to the small box size .",
    "a much larger simulation volume is required for adequate statistics at @xmath87 . however , simulating a much larger volume which would still have reasonable spatial and dark matter mass resolution on a single grid is computationally prohibitive at the present time .",
    "all of the simulation results described in this paper are performed without further star formation or feedback . having a single episode of star formation at @xmath35 means that metal evolution after that time is passive ,",
    "whereas in reality there would be continuous star formation and feedback .",
    "a logical extension of this work is the inclusion of later epochs of star formation and their resulting feedback of metals and energy into the igm .",
    "these results will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we would like to thank robert harkness for invaluable suggestions and technical assistance , and the referee , volker bromm , for suggestions which have significantly improved the quality of this manuscript .",
