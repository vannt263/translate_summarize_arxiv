    "[ bands]a , the band crossing below the fermi energy occurs along the @xmath27-@xmath28 direction when there is no existence of the anomalous orbital order ( aoh ) , @xmath29 , and electron and hole pockets are formed at the fermi energy . in the presence of a small value of the aoh term ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "the band crossing is lifted and the four bands are formed into two disentangled groups . however , the fermi pockets remain .",
    "furthermore , when the topological order is strong enough ( fig .",
    "[ bands]a with @xmath31 ) , an indirect band gap is open directly at the fermi energy and the bulk system becomes insulating , from which no superconducting pairing can emerge .",
    "now , we construct a strip geometry to study the electronic states at the edge with periodic ( fig .",
    "[ bands]b , d ) and open ( fig .  [ bands]c , e ) boundary conditions .",
    "since there still exists the translational invariance along the strip direction ( that is , @xmath32-direction ) at the original lattice constant , the momentum along this direction is a good quantum number , which allows to solve the problem for each given wave vector @xmath33 independently .",
    "we can see that the edge bands show up by comparing fig .",
    "[ bands]b , d and c , e . in the metallic / topological - metallic states(@xmath34 ) without the superconducting order , the edge bands have curved features across the fermi surface as highlighted in red in fig .",
    "[ bands]c .",
    "for @xmath29 the non - superconducting ( nsc ) edge states are four - fold degenerate ( including two spin orientations and two edges ) at a given @xmath33 near the region of @xmath35 . when @xmath36 , the degeneracy of edge bands near @xmath35 is reduced to two fold ( that is , only two - fold spin degeneracy ) at a given @xmath33 .",
    "however , these bands are still crossing the fermi energy .",
    "we now turn on the @xmath37-wave pairing ( @xmath38 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ bands]d , e ) . in the absence of the topological order ,",
    "the edge states have no zero - energy modes , which means the quasiparticle states are always gapped . only in the presence of a sufficiently large topological order ,",
    "can the edge states appear to cross the fermi energy ( see fig .  [ bands]e with @xmath39 ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath30 , the normal state is metallic and the superconducting pairing is physically feasible .",
    "therefore , we will focus on the case of @xmath30 in the next section . for @xmath31",
    "( see third row of fig .",

    "however , we include this case to show the structure of edge states in response to a `` superconducting '' particle - particle pair .     and * b * , @xmath30 .",
    "the high - symmetry momentum points of @xmath28 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined according to the brillouin zone of a 1-site per unit cell .",
    "the superconducting order parameter @xmath38 is taken . ]",
    "the tsc property can also manifest in the local electronic structure around a single impurity .",
    "the use of a single impurity is a powerful method to probe the superconducting pairing symmetry  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a universal impurity - induced mid - gap state has also been predicted as a clear signature of topological superfluids  @xcite , where the near - zero - energy bound state follows closely follow the symmetry of that of majorana fermions .",
    "inspired by the observation of a robust zero - bias conductance peak in the stm experiments around an interstitial - fe - impurity on the surface of the fe(te , se ) compound  @xcite , we construct a microscopic model for the local adsorbed impurity within our model .",
    "figure  [ ifi]a shows the 2d lattice structure for a pristine system , where @xmath42-orbital orientation is considered ; while fig .",
    "[ ifi]b shows an adsorbed fe atom and its effective local hopping with the neighboring fe atoms in the parent compound .",
    "we write down the total hamiltonian with the local effect of absorbed site , @xmath43 + { \\mathcal{s}}_z^{imp}[\\,j\\,]\\;,\\ ] ] in which @xmath44 is the local hopping term from the impurity site to its nearest neighboring fe atoms in the parent system with tunable hopping parameter @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ ifi]b ) , @xmath46 describes the local spin - polarized energy levels on the impurity site with an exchange parameter @xmath47 .",
    "see more details for @xmath44 and @xmath48 in the * methods * section .",
    "we will focus on the local density of states ( ldos ) for fixed topological order @xmath49 and sc pairing strength @xmath50 with varying @xmath45 and @xmath47 .    in the regime of a weak hybridization",
    ", one can anticipate that the resulting peaks in the ldos on the adsorbed impurity site merely reflects the energy levels of an isolated atom . in our work",
    ", we are more interested in the regime where the coupling between the adsorbed impurity and its neighbors is relatively strong .",
    "figure  [ figldos]a shows the ldos calculated on the adsorbed impurity for various values of @xmath45 and @xmath47 but with fixed @xmath38 and @xmath30 . for comparison , we also show the ldos far away from the impurity site ( black line in fig .",
    "[ figldos]a ) , which resembles the dos in a pristine bulk . for @xmath51",
    ", since the local hopping is still finite , two in - gap peaks appears near the gap edges . with the increased @xmath47 , these in - gap peaks",
    "are shifted toward the fermi energy ( e.g. , in the range of @xmath52 $ ] for @xmath53 as shown in fig .",
    "[ figldos]a ) , and cross the fermi energy ( e.g. , at @xmath54 for @xmath53 as shown in fig .  [ figldos]a ) , and move toward the gap edges ( e.g. , in the range of @xmath55 $ ] for @xmath53 as shown in fig .  [ figldos]a ) .",
    "we also found a regime of @xmath56 $ ] , for which the in - gap quasiparticle peaks show up again . since in this large @xmath47 regime , the effect of the topological order becomes non - essential , our results are comparable with those in the early study on a magnetic impurity in an iron - based superconductor  @xcite",
    "therefore , we do not show here the results for this regime .",
    "the in - gap bound states can also be visualized in the band structure in the reduced brillouin zone of the supercell lattice  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figldos]b , all the sub - figures are plotted with varying @xmath47 for fixed values of @xmath57 , @xmath30 and @xmath38 .",
    "the localization nature of these in - gap states are investigated by different size of the supercell . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figldos]b , the dispersiveness of the in - gap states is suppressed with increased size of the supercell , suggesting that these in - gap states are truly bound states . to further investigate the consequence of the topological order",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ figldos]c the ldos on the impurity site in the absence ( @xmath29 ) and presence ( @xmath30 ) of the topological order .",
    "the zero - energy peak in the ldos in the absence of the topological order is much narrower ( accompanied with higher intensity ) than that in the presence of the topological order , suggesting a much shorter decay length of quasiparticle bound state in the former .",
    "this contrast is further confirmed by the spatial dependence of the ldos at zero - energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figldos]d .",
    "specifically , the zero - energy bound state has a longer decay length along the bond direction in a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "this difference can be understood from the band structure of the pristine system in an unfolded brillouin zone , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figbdgband ] , where one can find that the topological order reduces significantly the gap for the wave vector near the @xmath40 point along the @xmath58 path .",
    "we now discuss the relevance of our results to the recent stm experiment on fe(te , se ) compound for an adsorbed fe impurity  @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the fe(te , se ) compound as mentioned in ref .",
    "has the number of @xmath15-electrons corresponding to the half - filling in the two - orbital model , which is different from the highly electron - doped kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the chemical potential should be set to ensure the half - filling in our calculations .",
    "in addition , since the distance from the adsorbed fe site to its nearest neighbors are shorter than the fe - fe bonding distance of the parent compound , we anticipate that the local hopping parameter ( @xmath45 ) between the adsorbed fe atom and its neighboring fe atoms is larger than those for the parent compound . on the other hand ,",
    "since the superconductivity for iron - based compounds arises from the fe @xmath59-electrons on an essentially square lattice , the normal - state part of the model hamiltonian originally designed for doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  @xcite , to match the low - energy band structure from the lda calculations  @xcite , should also be applicable to the fe(te , se ) system .",
    "for the present purpose , we carried out the dft calculations for an fe atom adsorbed in the center of fe plaquette of a large real - space structure of fe(te , se ) compound .",
    "see the * methods * section for the calculation details .",
    "we have found that a spin - polarized fe atom adsorbed on the surface of an otherwise paramagnetic fese compound has a lower energy than a non - spin - polarized adsorbed fe atom .",
    "figure  [ figlda]a shows the calculation of ldos for both non - spin - polarized ( upper panel ) and spin - polarized ( lower panel ) adsorbed fe atom .",
    "the broadened peak of the ldos on the adsorbed fe atom itself and the smearing of ldos structure on its neighboring fe sites in the fese compound ( as compared with that on the fe site far way from the adsorbed fe atom ) suggests a strong coupling between the adsorbed fe and its neighboring fe sites .",
    "it supports the treatment of the local hopping parameters in our model calculations . for the case of the spin - polarized case",
    ", the magnetization is mostly localized on the adsorbed fe itself with a proximately induced moment on its nearest neighboring fe sites negligibly small . finally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figlda]b , each @xmath15-orbital is spin polarized and contributes to the total magnetic moment of 2.89 @xmath12b . however , among the total magnetic moment , only about 14.48% ( about @xmath60 ) arises from each of the @xmath23- and @xmath22-orbitals , which are relevant to the corresponding orbitals active in the pristine compound .",
    "these finding supports the use of a local magnetic impurity with a small spin polarization in our model calculations .",
    "our model study has shown the combined effect of the @xmath7 topological mirror order and the fully gapped @xmath37-wave sc .",
    "this @xmath7 argument extends the mirror symmetry in the mirror - chern representation  @xcite for the topological superconductivity of a 2d lattice .",
    "the coexistence of this topological and the superconducting order relies on the intrinsic band structure of the @xmath42 orbitals , which gives a topological metallic state . there",
    "the emergence of gapless edge states in the coexisting phase is a direct evidence for the topological order .",
    "in addition , the introduction of a spin polarized impurity can be regarded as a zero - dimension boundary to the 2d lattice , and it induces a similar quasiparticle behavior as around a vortex core center in the topological superconductor  @xcite .",
    "in addition , our model calculations of the local electronic structure have revealed the topological feature of a superconductor through the ldos peak intensity and the size of the impurity - induced in - gap bound states .",
    "finally , our dft calculations of an adsorbed fe atom on the surface of the fese compound has indeed shown the adsorbed impurity is spin polarized , making the findings in the present work relevant to the stm experiment on the fe(te , se ) compound .    _ note added . _",
    "as we nearly completed our research , we noticed a recent study by zhang  @xcite that described the in - gap bound state around an adsorbed fe atom on the surface of iron - based superconductors , within an anderson impurity model with non - spin polarized @xmath15-electrons on the impurity site . due to the mismatch of energy levels between the impurity and the fe - sites in the background , the qualitative agreement with the stm experiment  @xcite",
    "was obtained by adjusting the chemical potential in the pristine system in the strict condition of an unrealistically small hybridization between the adsorbed fe atom and its neighbors .",
    "the shifted chemical potential leads to the system in the highly electron doped regime , which is inconsistent with the fact that fe(se , te ) is in the half - filled regime in the two - orbital model .",
    "in addition , it can be easily understood that with such a small hybridization , the zero - energy peak at the adsorbed fe site has the character of the energy levels of an isolated atom so that the peak intensity is too high .",
