    "outflows constitute one of the most spectacular , emblematic , and relevant early manifestations of the star formation process ( e.g.  lada 1985 ; arce et al .",
    "2007 ) . by removing angular momentum , they allow accretion to proceed ( bodenheimer 1995 ) , and through their injection of mechanical energy",
    ", they can affect the overall evolution of star - forming regions ( reipurth et al .",
    "their morphologies can also provide clues on the properties of the driving sources .",
    "for instance , the degree of collimation of outflows is believed to correlate with the age and mass of the driving protostars ( machida et al .",
    "2008 ; arce et al .",

    "2008 ) in the eastern part of the ophiuchus complex .",
    "soon after its discovery ( walker et al .",
    "1986 ) , it was found to power two bipolar outflow structures ( mizuno et al .",
    "one is oriented in the north - east  south - west direction ( at a position angle of about 55@xmath2 and hereafter called the ne - sw flow ) , while the other is oriented nearly east - west ( p.a .",
    "@xmath1 110@xmath3 , hereafter the ew flow ) .",
    "the existence of at least two protostellar sources was also established early thanks to high resolution radio observations ( wootten 1989 , mundy et al .",
    "these objects are known as component a to the south - east , and component b to the north - west , and their projected separation is about 5@xmath0 ( figure 1 ) . while component b remains single even at the highest angular resolution available ( @xmath1 0.05 arcsec ; rodrguez et al .  2005 ; chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) , component a breaks up into two centimeter sub - components called a1 and a2 at resolutions better than about 0.2@xmath0 ( figure 1 ) . because the relative orientation of the a1/a2 pair at the time of its discovery was very similar to the direction of the ne - sw flow , a1 was initially believed to be an ejecta from a2 .",
    "however , analysis of the relative motion of a1 and a2 favors a scenario where these two sources trace the two stars in a binary system ( loinard 2002 ; chandler et al .",
    "2005 ; loinard et al .",
    "2007 , pech et al .  2010 ) .",
    "sub - arcsecond submillimeter continuum observations obtained with the sma ( submillimeter array ) revealed additional structure in component a ( chandler et al .",
    "while the emission is dominated by a bright compact source ( called aa ) centered almost exactly between a1 and a2 , an additional source ( ab ) was detected to the north - east of component a ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this source has not been detected at any other wavelengths so far , and its exact nature remains mysterious .",
    "the ne - sw outflow has long been known to originate in component a ( e.g.  hirano et al .",

    "this association was unambiguously confirmed , and was further constrained , when loinard et al .",
    "( 2007 ) witnessed , at radio wavelengths , the ejection from a2 of a bipolar system of ejecta which , subsequently , moved away from a2 roughly along the direction of the ne - sw flow ( pech et al .",
    "the ew flow was recently shown to also originate from within component a by yeh et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who presented sma co(2 - 1 ) and co(3 - 2 ) observations at an angular resolution of a few arcseconds .",
    "these sma data , however , have insufficient angular resolution to distinguish between a1 and a2 as the driving source for the ew flow .",
    "interestingly , there is little evidence for outflow activity from component b. jrgensen et al .",

    "letter _ , we present combined alma ( atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ) and vla ( karl g.  jansky very large array ) observations of iras  162932422 that help elucidate the origin and nature of the outflows in this complex young stellar system .",
    "iras  162932422 was observed at @xmath4 = 0.45 mm with fifteen 12-m antennas of alma on april 2012 , during the science verification data program .",
    "the 105 independent baselines ranged in projected length from 26 to 403 m. the primary beam of alma at 0.45 mm has a fwhm of 8@xmath0 , so the observations were made in mosaicking mode with half - power point spacing between field centers to cover both source a and source b. the digital correlator was configured in 4 spectral windows of 1875 mhz and 3840 channels each .",
    "this provides a channel spacing of 0.488 mhz ( @xmath1 0.2 km s@xmath5 ) per channel , but the spectral resolution is a factor of two lower ( 0.4 km s@xmath5 ) due to online hanning smoothing .",
    "observations of juno provided the absolute scale for the flux density calibration while observations of the quasars j1625@xmath6254 and nrao530 ( with flux densities of 0.4 and 0.6 jy , respectively ) provide the gain calibration .",
    "the quasars 3c279 and j1924 - 292 were used for the bandpass calibration .",
    "the data were calibrated , imaged , and analyzed using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) and karma software ( gooch 1996 ) .",

    "the visibilities at 7 mm were imaged both with natural weighting ( robust = @xmath122 ) to obtain the highest sensitivity ( at the detriment of angular resolution ) , and with intermediate weighting ( robust = 0 ) to obtain higher angular resolution ( at the detriment of sensitivity ) .",

    "the sub - millimeter continuum emission ( @xmath4 = 0.45 mm ) measured by alma reveals the usual double source structure of iras  162932422 ( figure [ fig : almacont ] ) .",
    "component b is resolved but compact , with a peak brightness temperature of about 160 k. the total flux measured here with alma ( @xmath1 12.2 jy ) is consistent with the trend observed at lower frequencies that the spectral index of source b is between 2 and 2.5 from centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths ( chandler et al .",
    "component a is elongated along the ne - sw direction , with its peak at the position of source aa , and the faint extension to the ne corresponding to the position of source ab reported by chandler et al .",
    "interestingly , the centimeter sub - components a1 and a2 are not identifiable in this image , although the angular resolution would be sufficient to separate them .",
    "the peak brightness temperature of the sub - millimeter emission in component a is about 30 k. the overall properties of the alma image of component a suggest that the sub - millimeter continuum is dominated by the circumbinary envelope rather than by the individual disks around the protostars .",
    "this is not particularly surprising since the individual circumstellar disks are expected to be heavily tidally truncated in this very compact binary system ( projected separation of order 40 au ) .",
    "in contrast , the continuum at 7 mm is dominated by free - free radiation from the bases of the thermal jets and enables us to pin - point the embedded sources a1 and a2 ( figure [ fig : jvla ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates the complementarity of alma and the vla to study young stellar sources .",
    "when it is reconstructed to optimize sensitivity , the 7 mm emission from source a also reveals a faint elongation toward the ne similar to that seen in the sub - millimeter map , and extended emission surrounding the sources a1 and a2 . like the sub - millimeter continuum",
    ", this extended emission likely traces the circumbinary envelope . the emission associated with the extension of source a to the north - east ( i.e.  with source ab from chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) contributes roughly 1.4 mjy at 41 ghz , 0.5 jy at 305 ghz ( chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) and 3 jy at 696 ghz ( all values with relative uncertainties of order 50% ) .",
    "this yields a spectral index of 2.7 @xmath26 0.5 , consistent with that of the more compact emission from source a ( chandler et al .",
    "we argue that this elongation traces faint extended emission from the circumbinary envelope ( possibly related to dust accumulated in that direction by the ne - sw flow ) , rather than a new protostellar source in the system .    both the 7 mm and the 4 cm continuum maps ( figure [ fig : jvla ] ) reveal a new compact source to the ne of source a2 .",
    "this is strikingly similar to the situation encountered in the 2006 image of iras  162932422 at @xmath4 = 1.3 cm ( loinard et al .",
    "2007 ) when a bipolar ejection from a2 was seen for the first time .",
    "the bipolar ejection that occurred in 2006 produced the sources a2@xmath23 and a2@xmath24 that are still clearly seen in the 4 cm image ( figure [ fig : jvla]c ) and , faintly , in the 7 mm map ( figure [ fig : jvla]a ) .",
    "they are moving away from a2 at projected velocities of several tens of km s@xmath5 ( pech et al .",
    "we interpret the new source to the ne of a2 ( which we shall call a2@xmath25 ) as a new ejection from a2 . in the high resolution 7",
    "mm image , there is a faint extension to the sw of a2 which might correspond to the bipolar counterpart of a2@xmath25 .",
    "we note that in the first image following the ejection of the a2@xmath23/a2@xmath24 pair ( loinard et al .  2007 ) , the sw ejecta ( a2@xmath23 ) was not immediately detached from a2 either .",
    "iras  162932422 has been regularly monitored at centimeter wavelengths since the late 1980s ( chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) and the 2006 ejection was the first to be detected .",
    "the new ejection reported here suggests that source a2 might be entering a period of enhanced outflow activity .",
    "regular observations in the coming years and decades will be required to confirm this possibility , and will enable a detailed study of the kinematics and behavior of the ejecta .",
    "interestingly , a2@xmath23 , a2@xmath24 , a2@xmath25 , and a2 itself are well aligned ( figure [ fig : jvla]c ) but the position angle ( @xmath1 70@xmath2 ) of the line joining them is somewhat larger than the position angle ( @xmath1 55@xmath2 ) of the large - scale outflow known to originate from a2 ( e.g.  figure 5 in mizuno et al .  1990 ) .",
    "this suggests that the jet driven by source a2 is precessing as a consequence of the a1-a2 binarity .",
    "we note , finally , that there is no detectable co(6 - 5 ) emission associated with the ne - sw flow in the alma observations ( figure [ fig : outflowa ] ) .",

    "( 2008 ) and confirmed by rao et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , there is very strong blue - shifted co emission to the south of source b ( the location of component b2 in yeh et al .",
    "figure [ fig : outflowb ] displays the first moment co(6 - 5 ) map of this component ( in colors ) overlaid with the 0.45 mm continuum image ( in contours ) .",
    "it is clear that the co emission defines a 3@xmath0-long bubble - like structure oriented along the south - east  north - west direction ( at p.a .",
    "@xmath1 130@xmath2 ) with source b at its north - west apex .",
    "this structure points from source b toward source a , but there appears to be no material connection ( i.e.  no bridge of emission ) between the two . in particular , its south - east apex ( corresponding to the point nearest to a ) is located about 2@xmath0 to the north - west of source a. we conclude that this structure is associated with source b , and unrelated to source a. we should point out , here , that there is a significant amount of extended co emission around the systemic velocity of iras  162932422 ( v@xmath28 @xmath1 4 km s@xmath5 ) in the alma observations . this emission is poorly recovered by the interferometer , and its structure can not be assessed ; we filtered it out by ignoring the velocity channels around 4 km s@xmath5 , but note that our fluxes ( as given , for instance , in figure [ fig : outflowb ] ) are clearly underestimated since they do not include the ambient gas .",
    "interestingly , rao et al .  ( 2009 ) recently reported on the possible detection of a new outflow in iras  162932422 seen in sio(8 - 7 ) along a position angle very similar to that of the co structure seen here . the structure seen in sio ,",
    "however , is most prominent south of source a , and entirely at positive velocities .",
    "while there is sio(8 - 7 ) emission in the general direction of the co structure reported here , it is at @xmath124 km s@xmath5 rather than at 4 km s@xmath5 .",
    "higher resolution sio observations will clearly be needed to establish the relation ( if there is any ) between the sio structure reported by rao et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and the co structure reported here .    to our knowledge ,",
    "ours is the first direct indication for the existence of an outflow driven by source b. interestingly , there is no strong redshifted counterpart to the north - west .",
    "while this might reflect an intrinsic asymmetry of the flow , it could also at least partly reflect the structure of the circumstellar environment . as discussed by pineda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and zapata et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    ", at sub - millimeter wavelengths , both the co lines and the continuum emission toward source b are optically thick , so the red - shifted emission might be at least partly hidden from view .",
    "alternatively , iras  162932422 might be located close to the back side of the cloud where it is located .",
    "besides explaining the lack of a red - shifted lobe , this would be consistent with the very high optical depth toward source b.     ( starting at and in step of 0.2 jy beam@xmath5 ) .",
    "the color - scale bar on the right indicate the lsr velocities in km s@xmath5 . the synthesized beam of the continuum image is shown in the upper left corner of the image . , scaledwidth=43.0% ]    since the systemic velocity of source b is about 3 km s@xmath5 ( jrgensen et al .",
    "2011 ) while the most negative velocities reached by the outflow are @xmath1 @xmath68 km s@xmath5 , the ( radial ) expansion velocity of the bubble relative to source b is about 10 km s@xmath5 . at the distance of ophiuchus",
    ", the angular extent of the bubble ( 3@xmath0 ) corresponds to 5.4 @xmath9 10@xmath29 cm ( 360 au ) , and the dynamical age of the flow is of order 200 years . while this calculation might only provide a crude estimate of the true age of the structure , similar calculations for the other outflows in the system ( mizuno et al .",
    "1990 ) yield much larger dynamical ages , of order 10@xmath27 years .",
    "this is consistent with the commonly held view that source b is the youngest object in iras  162932422 ( e.g.  chandler et al .",
    "it could be argued that the true angular extent of the outflow is significantly larger than reported here , because the co(6 - 5 ) line might only pick the most highly excited gas in the vicinity of source b. this is unlikely because lower j co observations ( e.g.  yeh et al .",
    "2008 ) did not reveal any conspicuous emission on larger scales along the direction of this structure .",
    "the 7 mm continuum emission around source b has usually been interpreted as a nearly face - on disk ( rodrguez et al .",
    "recent alma spectroscopic observations further revealed unambiguous evidence for infall and rotation ( pineda et al .",
    "2012 , zapata et al .  in prep .",
    ") toward that source , and the rotation is also consistent with a nearly face - on orientation . in this configuration ,",
    "the flow driven by source b ought to be oriented nearly along the line of sight , and the expansion velocity would be mostly radial .",
    "this suggests that the true expansion velocity of the flow is not significantly larger than the observed 10 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the overall morphology of the outflow driven by source b is qualitatively different from that of typical flows powered by low - mass young stars . in particular",
    ", there is no evidence for a collimated jet - like structure along the symmetry axis . instead , the highest ( i.e.  most negative )",
    "velocities are associated with the inner layer of the structure , while the outer layers are at less negative velocities ( typically at about @xmath62 km s@xmath5 ; see figure [ fig : outflowb ] ) .",
    "this behavior suggests that source b drives a moderately collimated wind , that impinges into the stationary circumstellar medium , in a situation resembling that described theoretically by shu et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the flow driven by source b has a number of peculiar properties .",
    "it is fairly slow ( @xmath1 10 km s@xmath5 ) , outburst - like , and only moderately collimated .",

    "in this _ letter _ , we used combined alma and vla observations to examine the outflow activity in the very young ( class 0 ) protostellar system iras  162932422 . the well - known ne - sw and e - w large - scale molecular flows are confirmed to be driven from within component a to the south - east of the system . the ne - sw flow can unambiguously be associated with source a2 which might be entering a phase of enhanced activity .",
    "the alma co(6 - 5 ) observations have enabled us to discover a new outflow toward source b with peculiar properties : it is highly asymmetric , resembles an outburst , is fairly slow ( 10 km s@xmath5 ) , and lacks a jet - like feature along its symmetry axis .",
    "in addition , its dynamical age is only about 200 years .",
    "we argue that these properties result from the extreme youth of source b , which might be one of the youngest known protostars .",
