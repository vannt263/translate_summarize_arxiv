    "a recent renaissance of interest in pairing correlations in atomic nuclei is linked to the search for a reliable microscopic theory for describing the structure of medium mass nuclei around the @xmath2 line where protons and neutrons occupy the same major shell and their mutual interactions are expected to strongly influence the structure and decay modes of such nuclei .",
    "the revival of interest in pairing correlations is also prompted by radioactive beam experiments , which are advancing the exploration of ` exotic ' nuclei , such as neutron - deficient or @xmath3 nuclei far off the valley of stability .",
    "likewise , such a microscopic framework is important for astrophysical applications , for example a description of the @xmath4-process in nucleosynthesis , which runs close to the proton - rich side of the valley of stability through reaction sequences of proton captures and competing @xmath5 decays @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that a simple but powerful group theoretical approach , with @xmath6 the underpinning symmetry , can provide a microscopic description and interpretation of the properties of pairing - governed @xmath1 states in the energy spectra of the even-@xmath7 nuclei with mass numbers @xmath8 where protons and neutrons are filling the same major shell . in this regard ,",
    "it is important to recall that @xmath9 @xcite ( with a lie algebra that is isomorphic to @xmath0 ) has been shown to play a significant role in the structure of @xmath10-shell @xmath2 nuclei @xcite .",
    "indeed , a model based on this symmetry group can be used to track the results of an isospin - invariant pairing plus quadrupole shell - model theory @xcite .    a theory that invokes group symmetries",
    "is driven by an expectation that the wave functions of the quantum mechanical system under consideration can be characterized by their invariance properties under the corresponding symmetry transformations . but",
    "even if the symmetries are not exact , if one can find near invariant operators , the associated symmetries can be used to help reduce the dimensionality of a model space to a tractable size . within the framework of the @xmath6 symplectic group , an approximate symmetry",
    "drastically reduces the model space , which allows the model to be applied in a broad region of the chart of the nuclides @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is adequate only for a certain class of phenomena , which in our investigation is related to significant isovector ( isospin @xmath11 ) pairing correlations in even-@xmath7 nuclei .",
    "while the model is not valid for all the states in the energy spectra of the @xmath12 nuclei we consider ( nor can any model achieve this ) , it does yield a realistic reproduction ( with only 6 parameters ) of the pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath1 state  spectra in medium mass nuclei where the valence protons and neutrons occupy the same major shell .",
    "the validity and reliability of the model with respect to the interactions it includes are confirmed additionally via a finite energy difference method that we employed to reproduce detailed nuclear structure , including @xmath2 anomalies , isovector pairing gaps and staggering effects @xcite .",
    "the present investigation shows the advantage of the algebraic @xmath0 approach over other theoretical studies .",
    "namely , the @xmath6 model , which is based on helmer s quasi - spin scheme @xcite , is both simpler and provides a better understanding of the fundamental nature of the nuclear interaction compared , for example , to the more general but also more elaborate @xmath13 model @xcite based on the conventional seniority scheme of racah and flowers @xcite .",
    "it also yields a better and more detailed microscopic description of isovector pairing correlations and proton - neutron interactions than mean - field theories and results extracted from semi - empirical mass formulae .",
    "in addition , it can be used in higher - lying shells where other approaches can not be applied .",
    "it has been recognized for a long time that ground states of even - even nuclei reflect strongly on the nature of the nuclear interaction , especially its propensity to form correlated , angular momentum @xmath15 pairs @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the low - lying energy spectrum of isotopes of a doubly magic core ( such as @xmath16ca or @xmath17ni ) can be well reproduced in terms of neutron pair [ @xmath18 addition to the spectrum of states of the core . in complete analogy with this , if one adds to the ground state of the core @xmath19 pairs of nucleons ( two protons @xmath20 , two neutrons @xmath21 , or a proton and a neutron @xmath22 ) , one would construct fully paired states that in general reflect the close interplay of like - particle and @xmath22 pairs .",
    "provided that the isospin is ( almost ) a good quantum number , which is typically the case for low - lying states in light and medium mass even-@xmath7 nuclei with valence protons and neutrons simultaneously filling the same major shell , fully paired @xmath1 states built in this way describe isobaric analog @xmath1 states ( _ ias _ ) in nuclei across the entire shell . in the mass range @xmath23 where the influence of shape deformation on these @xmath1 _ ias _ states is relatively weak , this notion of fully paired ( seniority zero ) states is a valid , albeit approximate picture . while in even - even nuclei within this region",
    "the ground states are such fully paired @xmath1 states , this it is not always the case for odd - odd nuclei .",
    "the strong proton - neutron interaction usually drives the state with the least symmetry energy ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is nuclear isospin ) lowest .",
    "however , it is not the purpose of this article to investigate such states .",
    "rather , we consider the isobaric analog @xmath1 state , which is typically higher in energy and is strongly influenced by isovector pairing correlations .",
    "even though the states are represented as @xmath15 pairs , the interaction that governs them is not exclusively pairing in the @xmath15 channel , but must also include the important @xmath22 @xmath26 isoscalar ( @xmath27 ) interaction .",
    "the significant interplay between these isovector and isoscalar interactions is evident in the low - lying structure of @xmath2 odd - odd nuclei and has been the focus of a large number of experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the zero seniority @xmath1 states can be constructed as ( @xmath11)-paired fermions @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the numbers of @xmath15 pairs of each kind , @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 , respectively , and @xmath30 denotes the vacuum state .",
    "the transition operator , which changes the number of particles in a pairwise fashion , @xmath31 , creates a proton - neutron ( @xmath22 ) pair , a proton - proton ( @xmath20 ) pair or a neutron - neutron @xmath32 pair of total angular momentum @xmath33 and isospin @xmath11 .",
    "each operator @xmath34 , together with its conjugate pair - annihilation operator , @xmath35 , and a pair number operator generate an @xmath36 subgroup of @xmath6 , which in the case of @xmath37 is the standard like - particle pairing kerman s @xmath14 group @xcite .    from a microscopic perspective , the pair - creation ( pair - annihilation ) operators , @xmath38 ,",
    "are realized in terms of creation @xmath39 and annihilation @xmath40 single - fermion operators with the standard anticommutation relations @xmath41 where these operators create ( annihilate ) a particle of type @xmath42 ( proton / neutron ) in a state of total angular momentum @xmath43 ( half integer ) with projection @xmath44 in a finite space @xmath45 .",
    "there are ten independent scalar products ( zero total angular momentum ) of the fermion operators : @xmath46 which form a fermion realization of the symplectic @xmath0 lie algebra .",
    "such an algebraic structure is exactly the one needed to describe isovector ( like - particle plus @xmath22 ) pairing correlations and isospin symmetry in nuclear isobaric analog @xmath1 states . in ( [ gen ] ) , @xmath47 are the valence proton ( neutron ) number operators . the generators @xmath48 and @xmath49 are associated with the components of the isospin of the valence particles and close on an @xmath50 subalgebra of @xmath0 . in terms of the generators of the @xmath6 group ( [ gen ] ) , the operator that counts the total number of valence particle @xmath51 is expressed as @xmath52 and the third isospin projection operator is @xmath53 .",
    "while the @xmath6 symplectic group embeds in itself the well - known symmetry of like - particle pairing , @xmath54 , it brings into the theory the significant interaction between protons and neutrons through the reduction chains @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( proton - neutron pairing symmetry ) and @xmath57 ( isospin symmetry ) .",
    "these group reductions allow the @xmath6-invariant degenerate energy states to split , which is the case of physical interest .",
    "such a dynamical symmetry that our model possesses provides for a natural classification scheme of nuclei as belonging to a single-@xmath43 level or a major shell ( multi-@xmath43 ) , which are mapped to the algebraic multiplets .",
    "this classification also extends to the corresponding ground and excited states of the nuclei .",
    "the general model hamiltonian with @xmath6 dynamical symmetry consists of one- and two - body terms and can be expressed through the @xmath6 group generators , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the isospin operator , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are interaction strength parameters and @xmath62 is the fermi level energy .",
    "this hamiltonian conserves the number of particles ( @xmath51 ) and the third projection ( @xmath63 ) of the isospin , while it includes scattering of a @xmath20 pair and a @xmath21 pair into two @xmath22 pairs and vice versa .    as we have shown in @xcite , the algebraic model hamiltonian ( [ clh ] )",
    "arises naturally within a microscopic picture . using relations ( 2 )",
    ", it can be rewritten in standard second quantized form , which in turn defines the physical nature of the interaction and its strength .",
    "for example , in this way , one can identify the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 in ( [ clh ] ) with the strength of the @xmath15 @xmath11 pairing interaction between two protons ( neutrons ) and a proton and a neutron , respectively .",
    "the @xmath61 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 parameters are related to the expectation value of an average @xmath68-independent interaction , which includes for example high-@xmath68 like - particle interaction with a strength specified by the parameters @xmath69@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath67 term in ( [ clh ] ) , together with the @xmath61 term , is related to the microscopic nature of the odd @xmath68 isoscalar ( @xmath70 ) interaction between a proton and a neutron , @xmath71 , where the first part comprises the @xmath68-independent @xmath22 isoscalar force .",
    "it is diagonal in the isospin basis and can be compared to @xcite .",
    "in addition , the quadratic in @xmath72 term can be understood as an average two - body interaction between the valence particles ( note that for @xmath51 equivalent particles there are @xmath73 particle couplings ) .",
    "from another perspective , the @xmath67-term can be related to the symmetry energy @xcite as its expectation value in states with definite isospin is of the form @xmath74 , which enters as a symmetry term in many nuclear mass relationships @xcite .",
    "we refer to the @xmath67-term as _ a symmetry term _ , although it is common to address the symmetry energy in a slightly different way : the @xmath75 term together with the isospin dependence of the isovector pairing term yield both symmetry ( @xmath76 ) and wigner ( @xmath77 ) energies @xcite . the first one was originally included in the bethe - weizscker semi - empirical mass formula @xcite and implies that the nuclear symmetry energy has the tendency toward stability for @xmath2 .",
    "the wigner energy is associated with proton - neutron exchange interactions and is responsible for a sharp energy cusp at @xmath2 leading to an additional binding of self - conjugate nuclei @xcite . in short , the symmetry energy together with the terms that are linear in @xmath78 ( [ clh ] ) can be directly related to a typical mass formula @xcite , while in addition our model improves the description of isovector pairing correlations and high @xmath68 identical - particle and @xmath22 interactions and uses an advanced coulomb repulsion correction @xcite .    in this way ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) includes an isovector ( @xmath11 ) @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath20 pairing interaction ( @xmath79 for attraction ) and a diagonal ( in an isospin basis ) isoscalar ( @xmath27 ) proton - neutron force , which is related to the so - called symmetry term ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "hence , the model hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) includes the dominant interactions that govern the @xmath1 states under consideration and provides for an exact solution of the present problem .    in addition , the @xmath66-term in ( [ clh ] ) introduces isospin symmetry breaking and the @xmath80-term accounts for a plausible , but weak , isospin mixing .",
    "while both terms are significant in the investigation of certain types of phenomena @xcite , the study of their role is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "these parameters yield quantitative results that are better than the ones with @xmath81 and @xmath82 : for example , in the case of the @xmath83 level the variance between the model and experimental energies of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath1 states   increases by @xmath84 when the @xmath66 and @xmath80 interactions are turned off . at the same time , the latter provide only fine adjustments compared to the main driving forces incorporated in ( [ clh ] ) . in this sense , a simpler isospin invariant @xmath85 model is suitable for a qualitative description of the isobaric analog @xmath1 state   energy spectra of nuclei .",
    "the interaction strength parameters are estimated in a fit of the minimum eigenvalue @xmath86 of the @xmath87 energy operator ( [ clh ] ) to the coulomb corrected @xcite experimental energies @xcite of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath1 states of even-@xmath7 nuclei ( ground states for even - even nuclei and some [ @xmath3 ] odd - odd nuclei ) .",
    "we use the coulomb correction @xmath89 derived in @xcite so that the coulomb corrected energies are adjusted to be @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the total measured ( positive ) energy including the coulomb energy and @xmath92 is the corrected energy of a nuclear core .",
    "analogously , the theoretically predicted energies that include the coulomb repulsion can be obtained as @xmath93 .",
    "[ tab : fitstat ]    the fitting procedure was performed separately for three groups of nuclei with valence nucleons occupying ( * i * ) the @xmath94 level with a @xmath95 core , ( * ii * ) the @xmath83 level with a @xmath96 core , and ( * iii * ) the @xmath97 shell with a @xmath98 core @xcite .",
    "the results reveal that the model interaction accounts quite well for the available experimental energies for a total of @xmath99 nuclei ( refer to the small value of the @xmath100-statistics in table [ tab : fitstat ] , where @xmath101 is the sum of squares , @xmath102 , divided by the difference between the number of data cases and the number of fit parameters ) @xcite .",
    "the values of the parameters in @xmath87 ( [ clh ] ) are kept fixed hereafter ( table [ tab : fitstat ] ) .    in the case of the @xmath97 shell ( * iii * ) , the parameters of the effective interaction in the @xmath6 model with degenerate multi-@xmath43 levels are likely to be influenced by the non - degeneracy of the single - particle orbits .",
    "nevertheless , as the dynamical symmetry properties of the two - body interaction in nuclei from this region are not lost , the model remains a good multi-@xmath43 approximation @xcite , which is confirmed with the use of various discrete derivatives of the energy function @xcite .",
    "= 3.4 in    while the optimum fit is statistically determined solely by @xmath100 , the physical aspect of the nuclear problem requires , in addition , the estimate for the parameters to be physically valid . indeed ,",
    "the values of the like - particle pairing strength @xmath103 , obtained by our @xmath6 model , yield consistent results @xcite with the experimental pairing gaps derived from the odd - even mass differences @xcite . in this way",
    ", the @xmath103 values are expected to reproduce the low - lying vibrational spectra of near closed - shell nuclei in the @xmath104 limit of the model ( like - particle pairing ) ( figure [ pairlimitenspectra ] ) . when the results from the three nuclear regions ( * i * , * ii * , and * iii * ) are considered , the pairing strength parameter is found to follow the well - known @xmath105 trend @xcite , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a coefficient of correlation and represents the proportion of variation in the strength parameter accounted for by the analytical curve ( figure [ paramfna ] ) .",
    "similarly , the values of the other strength parameters lie on a curve that decreases with nuclear mass @xmath7 ( figure [ paramfna ] ) @xmath108 as expected for a symmetry energy term , the @xmath105 dependence holds for the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath61 on the mass number @xmath7 suggests that the quadratic correction @xmath109 to the mean field may change slowly from one nucleus to another , which is consistent with the saturation of the nuclear force .",
    "although the data set used in the fitting procedure was rather small , the trend toward a smooth functional dependence of the interaction strength parameters on the mass number @xmath7 reveals their _ global _ character , namely the interactions in the model hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) are related to an overall behavior common to all nuclei .",
    "= 3.4 in    furthermore , the wigner energy @xcite , @xmath110 , is implicitly included in the @xmath6 theoretical energy , which in turn makes the estimation of its strength possible .",
    "the wigner energy appears as the term that is the linear in @xmath111 in the @xmath22 isoscalar force ( proportional to the symmetry term ) and in the isovector pairing through the second - order casimir invariant of @xmath0 . in a good - isospin regime ,",
    "the symmetry energy contribution is @xmath112 [ due to the @xmath113-term in ( [ clh ] ) ] , and the @xmath114 interaction strength parameter can be expressed through the model parameters ( table [ tab : fitstat ] ) as @xmath115 . in the framework of the @xmath6 model , the estimated values for @xmath114 from the three regions ( * i * , * ii * and * iii * ) are found to lie on a curve @xmath116 with a very good correlation coefficient @xmath107 and a remarkably close value to most other estimates : @xmath117 @xcite , @xmath118 @xcite , @xmath119 @xcite , @xmath120 @xcite and @xmath121 @xcite .    in short",
    ", the outcome of the optimization procedures shows that the effective interaction with @xmath6 dynamical symmetry provides a reasonable description of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath1 states , retaining the physical meaning and validity of its microscopic nature .      in all three nuclear regions ,",
