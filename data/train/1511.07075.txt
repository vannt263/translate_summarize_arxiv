    "rare @xmath7 decays mediated through the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath8 transitions not only provide a testing ground for the gauge structure of standard model ( sm ) but are also an effective way to look for the physics beyond the sm . as we know that in sm the wilson coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 at @xmath14",
    "are used to describe the @xmath15 transition .",
    "therefore , in these transitions , np effects can be incorporated in two different ways : one is through new contributions to wilson coefficients and the other is via the introduction of new operators in effective hamiltonian which are absent in the sm .",
    "though the decay distribution of inclusive decays such as @xmath16 is theoretically better understood but hard to be measured experimentally . in opposite , the exclusive decays such as @xmath17 are easy to detect experimentally but are tough to calculate theoretically as the difficulty lies in describing the hadronic structure , which are the main source of uncertainties in the predictions of exclusive rare decays .",
    "the exploration of physics beyond the sm through various inclusive @xmath7 meson decays such as @xmath18 and their corresponding exclusive processes , @xmath19 with @xmath20 etc .",
    ", have already been studied @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that the above mentioned inclusive and exclusive decays of @xmath7 meson are very sensitive to the flavor structure of the sm and provide an effective way to explore np effects .",
    "regarding this precise measurements of different experimental observables for @xmath21 decay such as branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry , various polarization asymmetries of the final state leptons , etc could be useful in establishing the status of new physics ( np ) in near future , specially at lhc .",
    "for this reason , many exclusive b meson processes based on @xmath22 such as @xmath23@xcite , @xmath24@xcite , @xmath25@xcite and @xmath26@xcite have already been studied .",
    "it has been mentioned in @xcite that measurement of many additional observables , would be possible by studying the simultaneous polarizations of both leptons in the final state , which in turn would be useful in testing the sm and highlighting new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it should be mentioned here that double lepton polariztion asymmetries in @xmath27@xcite , @xmath28@xcite , @xmath29@xcite and @xmath30@xcite have already been studied . along with other observables ,",
    "forward backward asymmetry is also an efficient observable to explore np beyond the sm . in this",
    "regard , double lepton polarization forward - backward asymmertries in @xmath31@xcite , @xmath28@xcite , @xmath29@xcite and in @xmath32@xcite have already been explored .",
    "we would like to emphasise here that the situation which makes @xmath33 decay more interesting than @xmath31 is the mixing of axial vector states @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are the @xmath36 and @xmath37 states respectively .",
    "therefore , it is also interesting to see that how polarized forward - backward asymmetries of @xmath30 are influenced in the presence of new physics .",
    "so in the present work polarized forward - backward asymmetry in the exclusive decay @xmath33 are addressed using most general effective hamiltonian , including all forms of possible interactions , similar to the case of @xmath38@xcite decay .",
    "the physical states @xmath39 and @xmath40 are superposition of the p - wave states in the following way @xmath41 if we define , @xmath42 then above eqs",

    "at the quark level @xmath48 decays are induced by the transition @xmath49 , which in the sm , is described by the following effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the projector operators and @xmath52 is the square of momentum transfer while @xmath53 are wilson coefficients .",

    "it is important to mention here that in our numerical calculations of asymmetries and their average values , we do not include @xmath59 , otherwise the asymmetries would be largely effected by the contributions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 resonance around @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
