    "the increase of wireless internet - of - things ( iot ) requires a large volume of vacant frequency bands that the current dedicated spectrum policy can not cope with . to handle the spectrum shortage ,",
    "the devices need to detect and access an unoccupied spectrum in an opportunistic manner @xcite , @xcite . however , most wireless iot devices are hard to perform precise spectrum sensing by themselves due to their limited hardware capability and less cost @xcite .",
    "spectrum sensors are essential as a part of the infrastructure for the sole purpose of interference monitoring @xcite .    the locational difference of an iot device and the corresponding sensor causes an observation error of spectrum occupancy .",
    "a mathematical model reflecting this spatial relationship is thus required . to this end",
    ", we derive a conditional interference distribution ( cid ) at an iot device for a given measured interference from the sensor using stochastic geometry ( sg ) .",
    "we find that its shape is skewed to the left of the sensor measurement and it has a long tail to the right side .",
    "this asymmetric tendency becomes intensified with increasing the measured interference level at the sensor . in other words ,",
    "the iot devices may experience less interference than the measured value with high probability . from the perspective of an opportunistic spectrum access",
    ", the iot device would has more chances to exploit the band while guaranteeing the quality of services ( qos ) of primary communications .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the existing interference distributions based on sg @xcite@xcite can not explain the above asymmetric spatial correlation between the sensors and the iot devices , which is a key to design cognitive radio iot networks .",
    "we propose a novel cognitive random access algorithm to adjust its transmission probability in a distributed manner according to the measured interference .",
    "based on the cid , the proposed algorithm improves an area spectral efficiency ( ase ) in return while satisfying the requirement of primary users .",
    "analytic and numerical results show that our algorithm outperforms conventional aloha @xcite and threshold based random access protocol with a hard decision , where an iot device can access the medium only when a measured sensor value is lower than the predetermined threshold .",
