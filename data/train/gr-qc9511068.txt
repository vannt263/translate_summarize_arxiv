    "the terms in the stress - energy tensor associated with nontrivial topology also experience this blue - shift @xcite . as a result , in the vicinity of the cauchy horizon ( even when a region we consider is flat and is located far from either mouth ) the behaviour of the energy density",
    "has nothing to do with what one could expect from the `` almost minkowski '' approximation @xcite .",
    "( the difference is so great that _ beyond _ the horizon we can not use the known quantum field theory , including its methods of evaluating the energy density , at all @xcite . ) consider , for example , the misner space with the massless scalar field in the conformal vacuum state . from the results of sec .",
