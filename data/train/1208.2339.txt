    "hadronic reactions in a nuclear medium can shed additional light on the hadronization process . in comparison with other reactions electroproduction",
    "has the virtue that energy and momentum of the struck parton are well determined , as they are tagged by the scattered lepton .",
    "study of hadron production in sidis on nuclear targets offers an opportunity to investigate the quark ( string , color dipole ) propagation in nuclear matter and the space - time evolution of the hadronization process . for this purpose",
    "we investigate the nuclear attenuation ( na ) , which is a ratio of differential hadron multiplicity on a nucleus to that on deuterium : + @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are energies of the final hadron and virtual photon , @xmath4 is the number of semi - inclusive hadrons at given @xmath3 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the number of inclusive dis leptons at given @xmath3 . subscripts @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) denote that reaction takes place on nucleus ( deuterium ) . in the above formula",
    "more variables like -@xmath9 ( the photon virtuality ) and @xmath10 ( hadron transverse momentum ) over which the na is averaged , are not written .",
    "the simple version of the string model , so called two - scale model ( tsm ) , was introduced in ref .",

    ", two versions were used : ( i ) the leading hadron distribution function , which corresponds to the term with rank equal one of the distribution function ; and ( ii ) the standard lund distribution function , which possible to sum analytically over all ranks of hadrons carrying momentum @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , more realistic symmetric lund distribution function it is not possible to sum over all ranks analytically .",
    "for this reason it was not included in the fit .",
