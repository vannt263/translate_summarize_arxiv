    "the ideas proposed in this paper have grown out of dissatisfaction with the existing interpretations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the problem is not that quantum mechanics does not yield the correct experimental _",
    "predictions _ , but rather that there is still no consensus about the _ metaphysical content _ of the theory , that is , the story that quantum mechanics tells us about reality .",
    "some people simply turn the tables and consider the lack of a clear , indisputable metaphysical interpretation not as a _ bug _ but rather a _ feature _ , denying the existence of objective reality altogether .",
    "doing so , however , appears to me as an act of resignation rather than a satisfying solution to the conundrum .",
    "the theory that i am going to propose offers a transparent and consistent interpretation of non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "measurements are taken to be ordinary processes , there is no objective `` collapse of the wavefunction '' , and the wavefunction is a convenient mathematical representation of a physically existing continuum of trajectories through configuration space , each one corresponding to an individual _",
    "world_. there is no distinction between a `` quantum system '' and a `` classical apparatus '' to explain the definite outcome of measurements and their probabilistic behavior .",
    "elementary particles have at all times and in all worlds a well - defined position in 3d space ; there are no such things as `` probability clouds '' and `` objective uncertainty '' .",
    "rather , probability emerges as the consequence of insufficient knowledge of observers about which world it is that they live in .",
    "the quantitative form of such epistemic probability does not rely on a `` quantum equilibrium hypothesis '' as in bohmian mechanics , or a `` branch weight '' as in everettian mechanics , but is derived from the concept of a _ substantial density _ of trajectories in configuration space , which is regarded as an objective feature of the physically existing universe ( or _ multiverse _ , if one prefers to say ) .",
    "more precisely , the universe ( multiverse ) is conceived of as a continuum of trajectories endowed with a certain density that determines how densely the trajectories are packed in different regions of configuration space .",
    "each trajectory corresponds to a _ world _ , and all worlds equally exist .",
    "my proposal is different from bohmian mechanics in that the wavefunction does not represent a physical field existing in addition to particles , and it is different from everettian mechanics in that the worlds are precisely defined and do not split ( figure [ fig : ontologies ] ) .",
    "the theory is based on ideas initially published as a preprint draft @xcite , which has been completely re - worked and enhanced , in particular by adding a logical framework to properly deal with propositions about physical systems in a multiplicity of worlds , and by providing the conceptual prerequisites for treating the collection of worlds as a continuous substance . after having finished and submitted an earlier version of this manuscript",
    ", i noticed that essentially the same theory , though with a stronger focus on formal aspects and less focus on ontological and epistemological matters , has independently been put forward by poirier and schiff @xcite .",
    "although already having been aware of , and having cited , these publications , i did not fully recognize how close their theory was to mine .",
    "the similarities have probably been masked from my eyes by the authors central emphasis on the elimination of the wavefunction from the theory , which was ( and is ) not an issue in my approach .",
    "the wavefunction in my approach is a generating function of , and thus a mathematical representative for , a continuum of trajectories identified as worlds , and so it has its own justification to remain within the theory .",
    "i will discuss the approach by poirier and schiff in some more detail in the last section , along with related approaches by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "everettian mechanics describes a universe of constantly branching , vaguely - defined worlds that evolve through hilbert space .",
    "bohmian mechanics describes a wavefunction plus one single precisely - defined world that both evolve through configuration space .",
    "the here - proposed theory describes the a continuum of precisely - defined worlds of varying density , which evolves through configuration space , and where each world corresponds to a bohmian trajectory .",
    "the wavefunction serves as a generating function for the continuum of trajectories , which constitutes the physically existing universe.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : logical - framework ] , a logical framework is proposed to properly deal with propositions evaluated in a multiplicity of worlds and at a multiplicity of times , whereby _ time _ and _ world _ are treated as so - called _ modes of existence_. the concept of a _ world continuum _ is introduced as a physically existing entity consisting of a continuum of worlds .",
    "also , the concept of an _ instance _ is introduced , which comes in three flavors . _",
    "a time - instance _ is an instance of an object at a specific time , a _ world - instance _ is an instance of an object in a specific world , and a _ time - world - instance _ is an instance of an object at both a specific time and in a specific world .",
    "the logical framework is then applied to the case of particles as the basic entities of the theory .",
    "it is postulated that each world corresponds to one and only one trajectory of the universe in configuration space , so that worlds can be identified with trajectories .",
    "each time - world - instance of the universe corresponds to the configuration of all particles in the universe at a specific time and in a specific world .    in section [ sec : probability ] , the notion of _ continuous substance _ is introduced and discussed to properly deal with a continuum of worlds later on .",
    "in particular , the _ substantial amount _ and the _ substantial density _ of a given substance are defined and discussed .",
    "subsequently , probability is put forward as an epistemic concept deriving from the insufficient knowledge of observers about which world it is that they live in . to this aim",
    ", the well - known laplacian rule is generalized to a continuous number of possibilities with the help of a measure that is specified as the substantial amount of worlds whose trajectories are crossing a certain region in configuration space .",
    "the role and the physical meaning of the wavefunction is discussed in section [ sec : wavefunction ] , as well as the role and the meaning of configuration space and of the world continuum .",
    "it is held that the wavefunction does not represent a physically existing entity itself but is rather to be considered an abstract generating function for the physically existing world continuum .    a minimal set of postulates",
    "is given in section [ sec : foundations ] to formally define the theory .",
    "measurement is introduced as a special case of an otherwise ordinary interaction between a system of interest and a measurement apparatus , yielding the born rule as a subjective measure of uncertainty about measurement outcomes obtained in individual worlds .",
    "the `` collapse of the wavefunction '' is derived as a useful but merely subjective description at the level of an individual world .    in the final section ,",
    "several aspects of my proposal and their relation to other proposals and criticisms found in the literature are discussed . in particular , the relation between objective reality and subjective experience in the presence of a multiplicity of worlds is addressed .",
    "my proposal is compared to bohmian mechanics , to tipler s formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , to the miw approach of hall et al .",
    "@xcite , to sebens newtonian qm @xcite , and to poirier and schiff s approach @xcite .",
    "i will also respond to criticisms raised by @xcite and @xcite against the idea of a continuum of worlds .",
    "after having long been ignored and ridiculed , the many - worlds interpretation has in recent years become a scientifically recognized and intensely discussed interpretation of quantum mechanics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for modern accounts )",
    ". among the main objections against the many - worlds interpretation is the criticism that it is too vague about the notion of _ worlds _ , and that the entire conception of many worlds existing in parallel is absurd in the first place ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , at first sight it appears problematic or even absurd to consider our world as one out of many worlds , for we usually speak of _ the _ world and understand it as _ everything that exists_. the inventor of many - worlds quantum theory , hugh everett iii , originally did not use the term `` world '' , and he named his theory the `` relative - state formulation of quantum mechanics ''  @xcite and `` the theory of the universal wavefunction '' @xcite .",
    "however , the notion of _ worlds _ became more and more popular in discussions of everett s theory ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and was eventually introduced to the public by dewitt  @xcite .",
    "i will stick to the now firmly established convention of using the term `` world '' , though i will use it in a very specific manner . in the extended logical framework that i will propose , there are two _ modes of existence _ , and these are _ time _ and _ world_. the key idea is very simple . in conventional logic , objects can not _ at the same time _ have a property and not have that property . in the proposed logical framework",
    ", objects can not _ at the same time and in the same world _ have a property and not have that property .",
    "so , while in conventional logic there is only one mode of existence , which is time , in the extended framework there are two modes of existence , which are _ time _ and _ world .",
    "_ we will first concentrate on the _ time _ mode and suppress the _ world _ mode .",
    "once we have clarified how to treat _ time _ in a logical framework , and once we have set up the terminology , we can straightforwardly extend the framework to also include the _ world _ mode .",
    "we shall see that _ world _ and _ time _ are treated in an analogous manner , and since we are already quite familiar with the concept of _ time _ ",
    "at least we have some intuition in using this concept  we will be able to understand how the concept of _ world _ can be understood as well . in a similar sense that classical mechanics can be understood as a",
    "_ many - times _ theory , non - relativistic quantum mechanics can be understood as a _ many - worlds _ theory in addition to its many - times aspect",
    ".    why should one take it that quantum mechanics , in contrast to classical mechanics , needs a _ world _ mode of existence in addition to the _ time _ mode ?",
    "because in quantum mechanics the worlds _ interfere _ with each other .",
    "this interference of worlds is responsible for the typical `` quantum '' phenomena that go beyond classical explanation .",
    "for example , an electron going through a double - slit produces an interference pattern because its trajectory in one world interferes with its trajectories in other worlds . in the classical theory",
    "there are no interference patterns produced by individual particles , so there is no need to consider additional worlds that interfere with each other .",
    "other experimental paradigms where a many - worlds interpretation yields a straightforward and transparent explanation is neutron interference @xcite , quantum computation @xcite and counterfactual measurement @xcite__. _ _ after all , the most important reason to favor a many - worlds interpretation is not simply to satisfy a somewhat romantic attitude but rather to better understand quantum phenomena and to avoid serious conceptual difficulties .",
    "let us begin with the more familiar concept of _ time_. physically existing objects have their properties each _ at a given instance of time_. an instance of time is also referred to as a _ time point _ ,",
    "but in the following we shall drop the explicit distinction between _ time points _ and _ times _ whenever there is no risk of confusion .",
    "that is , by saying that an object _",
    "@xmath0 _ has a particular property _ @xmath1 _ at a given _ time _",
    "@xmath2 , we mean that the object has the property at the _ time point _ @xmath2 .",
    "we denote this statement by the formula @xmath3=``@xmath4 '' and call it an _ anchored proposition .",
    "_ as usual in a physical theory , time points are represented by real numbers , so the set @xmath5 of all time points equals the entire real line , @xmath6 .",
    "the temporal anchor plays the role of the _ present time _ of an anchored proposition__. _ _ consider an _ unanchored _ proposition like `` the traffic lights are green '' . in one moment",
    "the traffic lights may be green , in another moment they may be red , or yellow , or something else .",
    "we can anchor an unanchored proposition by adding `` now '' to it , where `` now '' is an _ unspecified temporal anchor _ to be treated as a variable .",
    "formally , the partial expression `` @xmath7 '' occurring in the proposition @xmath3=``@xmath4 '' is the _ body _ of the proposition , and @xmath2 is the _",
    "( temporal ) anchor_. if the temporal anchor is unspecified , that is , it is not given by a real number but remains a variable , then the proposition remains _",
    "unevaluated_. we can evaluate it either by specifying a numerical value for @xmath2 , or by quantifying over @xmath2 , so that , for example , for a given time period @xmath8 the proposition `` @xmath9 '' is understood as `` object @xmath0 has property @xmath1 during @xmath10 '' , which is either true or false .",
    "the proposition is then anchored to the specified interval @xmath10 , which may also coincide with the entire time domain @xmath5 . in the latter case",
    "we may use the shorthand notation `` @xmath11 '' to mean `` @xmath12 '' , and similarly `` @xmath13 '' to mean `` @xmath14 '' .",
    "since real numbers form an ordered set , a temporal anchor @xmath2 can be set into relation with other time points , so that time points that are smaller or bigger than @xmath2 , in the usual order of @xmath15 , play the role of , respectively _ past ( earlier ) _ or _ future ( later ) _ time points relative to @xmath2 .",
    "we then can then formalize the proposition `` object @xmath0 will have the property @xmath1 '' as `` @xmath16 '' , and the proposition `` object @xmath0 never had the property @xmath1 '' as `` @xmath17 '' .",
    "the variable @xmath2 is then the unspecified anchor of both propositions and represents the `` now '' of the proposition , that is , the present time relative to which the body of each proposition is anchored in the future and the past , respectively .",
    "let us now extend the logical framework by adding _",
    "world _ as another mode of existence .",
    "that is , an object has properties only with respect to a particular time and a particular world .",
    "anchored propositions are then of the form @xmath18=``@xmath19 '' , which is understood as `` object @xmath0 has property @xmath1 at time @xmath2 and in world @xmath20 '' .",
    "the expression `` @xmath7 '' is , again , the _ body _ of the anchored proposition @xmath18 , and the expression `` @xmath21 '' is the _ anchor _",
    ", with @xmath2 being the _ temporal anchor _ and @xmath20 being the _ world anchor .",
    "_ just like the temporal anchor @xmath2 plays the role of the _ present time _ of the proposition , the world anchor @xmath20 plays the role of the _ actual world _ of the proposition__. _ _ let us denote the set of all worlds by @xmath22 and allow to quantify over both worlds and times , so that , say , for a given set @xmath23 the formal proposition @xmath3=``@xmath24 '' reads `` for all worlds in @xmath25 the object @xmath0 once had the property @xmath1 '' .",
    "that proposition involves the variable @xmath2 as an unspecified temporal anchor , and it remains unevaluated until @xmath2 is specified or quantified .",
    "consider another different example involving the variable @xmath20 as an unspecified world anchor : the formal proposition @xmath26=``@xmath27 '' reads `` in the actual world the object @xmath0 always has the property @xmath1 '' and remains unevaluated as long as the actual world @xmath20 is not specified or quantified .",
    "if the actual world of the proposition lies within some given set @xmath23 , then the proposition becomes @xmath28=``@xmath29 '' , which is understood as `` in all worlds contained within @xmath25 the object @xmath0 always has the property @xmath1 '' .",
    "the proposition @xmath28 contains no free variables and hence is an evaluated proposition . in the case",
    "@xmath30 we may shorten `` @xmath31 '' into `` @xmath32 '' , and `` @xmath33 '' into `` @xmath34 '' .",
    "there is yet another , logically equivalent , way of understanding anchored propositions , which might be favorable under certain circumstances .",
    "the occurrence of an object at a particular time and in a particular world can be considered an _ instance _ of that object .",
    "then , there are different instances of one and the same object at different times and in different worlds , but it is still the same object that is instantiated . in terms of instances ,",
    "thus , the formula @xmath18=``@xmath35 '' is understood as `` the instance @xmath36 has the property @xmath1 '' . note that the talk of instances and the talk of objects are just two different ways to read a proposition .",
    "we may switch back and forth between the two readings as we like and keep in mind that doing so does not affect the content of the proposition .",
    "there are three different ways of using instance talk .",
    "one of these ways is the talk of _ time - world instances _ that we have just encountered .",
    "another way is to translate only the _ time _ mode into an instance and leave the world mode as it is .",
    "thus , instead of speaking of an object having some property at a specific time and in a specific world , one may speak of a _ time - instance _ of the object having the property in a specific world .",
    "so , for example , instead of saying that `` joe went to school when he was six in world @xmath20 '' , one may say that `` six - year - old joe went to school in world @xmath20 '' . formally , a time - instance of joe is denoted as @xmath37 , and in the given example @xmath2 would denote some point in time when joe was six years old . the third way is to translate only the world mode into an instance , so that @xmath38 is the instance of joe in world @xmath20 .",
    "it is helpful to visualize objects as being _ extended _ into both the time mode and the world mode .",
    "that is , one may conceive of modes in a manner analogous to dimensions .",
    "instances then collapse objects along some of their modes .",
    "a time - instance collapses the object along the time mode , so that it remains extended along the world mode .",
    "for example , a time - instance of an electron is an _",
    "electron cloud_. a world - instance collapses the object along the world mode so that it remains extended along the time mode .",
    "for example , a world - instance of an electron is a _",
    "trajectory_. last , a time - world - instance collapses the object along both modes , so that it loses its modal extension and becomes a `` modal point '' .",
    "for example , a time - world - instance of an electron is a point located in 3d space .",
    "instances inherit the properties that the objects have at their instantiation .",
    "for example , a time - world instance @xmath39 of an electron @xmath40 is located at the position @xmath41 that the electron occupies at time @xmath2 in world @xmath20 . and",
    "as for joe , his time - world instance @xmath42 has the property of going to school .    it should have become clear from the setup of the framework and the chosen formulations that i understand neither the _ present time _ nor the _ actual world _ as absolute entities .",
    "rather , i regard all times and all worlds as equally existing , although they do not exist in the same sense in which objects exist .",
    "an object exists _ at _ a time and _ in _ a world . without a time and a world",
    "the object can not exist .",
    "so times and worlds are _ preconditions _ of existence , or more precisely , in the terminology of the here - proposed framework , times and worlds are _ _ modes of existence__.      as usual in a physical theory , we will from now on restrict the set of objects to systems of elementary particles__. _ _ technically , a system of particles is a _",
    "mereological sum _ of particles , that is , particles are in a part - whole relationship with systems .",
    "a one - particle system consists of only one particle , and an @xmath43-particle system consists of @xmath43 particles .",
    "if a particle is part of a system which is part of another system , then the particle is also part of the latter system .",
    "we shall not dive into the details of the theory of mereology , and the reader may be referred to textbook literature ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "systems of particles can not be naively identified with macroscopic objects .",
    "macroscopic objects ( ships , dogs , people ) , may lose or gain particles and still remain the same macroscopic object , which is not the case for systems .",
    "it is a highly nontrivial question how to define macroscopic objects and how to identify them across time . of course",
    ", it should be no less problematic to identify macroscopic objects across _",
    "worlds_. if in one world joe is lacking one hair compared to our world , it would appear natural to assume that it is still _ joe _ who is lacking a hair in that world , and not a completely different person .",
    "i believe these issues can somehow be settled , so that it makes sense to speak of one and the same object ( including people ) across different times and across different worlds .",
    "luckily , though , these difficulties do not affect the quantum theory that i am going to propose , as they do not arise for elementary particles .",
    "an elementary particle at different times simply _ is _ the same particle , only at different times , and a particle in different worlds simply _ is _ the same particle , only in different worlds .",
    "( recall that instances are no _ copies _ ; it is _ the same particle _ that only occupies different positions in space at different times and in different worlds . )    the symbol `` @xmath0 '' denoting a system of particles in a proposition like `` @xmath19 '' is taken as a _ rigid designator _ in a sense analogous to how kripke introduced the term into modal logic @xcite : the symbol refers to the same system at all times when it exists , and in all worlds where it exists .",
    "since we stay in the non - relativistic domain , there is no particle creation or annihilation .",
    "thus , if a particle exists in one world at one time , then it exists at all other times in that world .",
    "let us further demand particle conservation _ across worlds _",
    ", so that when a system @xmath0 exists at one time and in one world , it also exists at any other time and in any other world . there can be no particles missing and no particles being added to the system across worlds and across time .",
    "the system of _ all _ particles is identified with the _ universe _ , and the number of particles in the universe is assumed to be finite and equal to some fixed number @xmath43 .",
    "particles have a fundamental property , which is their position in three - dimensional space .",
    "a particle can at some time @xmath2 and in some world @xmath20 have the position @xmath44 , and at another time @xmath45 and in another world @xmath46 have the position @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the universe consisting of @xmath43 particles , and @xmath49 be a complete list of the positions of all particles . then this list of positions , which is called a _ configuration _ of the universe ,",
    "can mathematically be interpreted as a vector in the @xmath50-dimensional space @xmath51 , which is called the",
    "_ configuration space_. a point in the 3@xmath43-dimensional configuration space corresponds to the position of @xmath43 particles in the three - dimensional space ( _ 3d space _ , in short ) .",
    "there is a subtle but profound issue with defining the configuration space as the vector space @xmath52 , and this issue will later be discussed and addressed by re - defining the configuration space as the tensor space @xmath53 instead .",
    "the following considerations , though , are independent of this choice of definition .",
    "let @xmath54 be the property of having the configuration @xmath55 , then the proposition `` @xmath56 '' asserts that the universe has the configuration @xmath57 at time @xmath2 and in world @xmath20 .",
    "now let us assert that _ at every time there is for every world a unique configuration of the universe_. in propositional calculus this is translated into the conjunction of the following two propositions : @xmath58 the first proposition asserts that for every time and for every world there is ( at least ) one configuration of the universe , and the second proposition asserts that the configuration is unique .",
    "so there is a set of trajectories @xmath59 through configuration space , which is in one - to - one correspondence to the set of worlds @xmath60 , @xmath61 consequently , we may _ identify _ worlds and trajectories .",
    "this should not be taken to suggest that worlds literally _ are _ trajectories , in the sense of a synonym .",
    "the term `` world '' just has a different linguistic function than the term `` trajectory '' .",
    "but whenever the term `` world '' is used in the theory , we know that it _ corresponds _ to a unique trajectory .",
    "with regard to the considerations further above , a trajectory is a _ world - instance _ of the universe , that is , it is fixed to one specific world but extended into the time mode . a _",
    "time - world - instance _ of the universe would then be a particular _ configuration _ of the universe .    the uniqueness relations and imply that each trajectory is uniquely defined by any one of its points .",
    "so , we may _ parametrize _ the trajectories by their initial configuration at @xmath62 , yielding the _ trajectory function _ @xmath63 , so that each trajectory @xmath64 is related to the trajectory function via @xmath65 , which implies that @xmath66 .",
    "the trajectory function is a unique characterization of the continuous bundle of trajectories @xmath67 , and hence can be regarded as an alternative representation of the latter .    up to",
    "now there have been no further restrictions imposed on the actual _ form _ of the trajectories .",
    "they are not required ( so far ) to be continuous or differentiable or anything else ; they might be erratic and discontinuous , jumping around across configuration space from one moment to another in a fractal manner , resembling a random process rather than a deterministic evolution .",
    "the actual form of the trajectories is what the _ physical laws _ will yield .",
    "these laws are sorting out unphysical trajectories from physical ones , which leads us to a quite general definition of a physical law : a physical law is a restriction on the set of logically possible ways the universe may evolve in time .",
    "there are ( vastly ) more logically possible ways the universe may evolve than there are physically possible ways .",
    "consequently , the set of _ logically _ possible worlds is much bigger than the set of _ physically _ possible worlds .",
    "a physical theory essentially defines how the set of logically possible worlds is to be restricted to the set of physically possible worlds by conditions imposed on the corresponding trajectories , and these conditions come in the form of differential equations .",
    "the success of quantum mechanics is often regarded as evidence for _ objective probability _ and _ objective uncertainty_. quantum mechanics , so we are told , enforces a picture of nature not being decided about `` how to proceed '' when a measurement takes place , or even not being decided about `` how to be '' with respect to unobserved system properties .",
    "however , bohmian mechanics as well as everettian mechanics offers a different picture in this respect .",
    "both theories deny the necessity of objective probability .",
    "rather , the universe is at all times in a certain ( quantum ) state , and probability only comes into play as a consequence of _ incomplete knowledge _ of the observer , a concept of probability that is referred to as _ subjective _ or _",
    "epistemic probability_. in everettian mechanics , the world of an observer is splitting up into multiple worlds during a measurement process , and the observer does not know which world he or she ( as a macroscopic system capable of conscious experience ) will end up in after the measurement .",
    "there are puzzling issues with this kind of interpretation ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we will not get into detail here . in bohmian mechanics ,",
    "the particles in the universe are at all times in a certain configuration , but the observer does not ( precisely ) know which configuration that is . the challenge of both interpretations is not merely a philosophical one , but also how to get the empirically correct numerical values for the probabilities as given by",
    "_ born s rule_. for @xmath68 being a projector onto the eigenspace of some eigenvalue @xmath69 of an observable @xmath70 , born s rule says that for a system being at time @xmath2 in a state described by the wavefunction @xmath71 , the probability to find the observable @xmath70 obtaining the value @xmath69 in a measurement at time @xmath2 , is given by @xmath72 as for everettian mechanics , there are numerous attempts to derive born s rule using various approaches involving observer memory states @xcite , infinite ensembles @xcite , frequency operators @xcite , decoherence @xcite , consistent histories @xcite , and decision theory @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are still controversial . as for bohmian mechanics ,",
    "born s rule is derived on the basis of an additional _ quantum equilibrium hypothesis _ , whose status and justification are a controversial issue as well .",
    "the quantum equilibrium hypothesis ( qeh ) asserts that the probability density of the configuration of a system described by the wavefunction @xmath71 is at some time point @xmath2 given by @xmath73 in which case the system is said to be in _ quantum equilibrium .",
    "_ by virtue of the continuity equation , then , the probability distribution @xmath74 is guaranteed to satisfy relation for all times @xmath2 , a feature that is called _ equivariance_. as the here - proposed theory , which may be called the _ world continuum theory _",
    ", is a combination of bohmian and everettian mechanics , it may come to no surprise that it avoids objective probability in favor of an epistemic account .",
    "probability comes into play as a measure of the subjective uncertainty of an observer about the world _ he or she actually lives in _ , which is a somewhat sloppy way of saying that he or she does not precisely know which _ world mode _ is to be used when determining the trajectory of the universe that governs his or her own experience .",
    "we will use that sloppy talk since it is much shorter and simpler to grasp , but we shall keep in mind that it has to be understood in a more sophisticated sense .      the approach to probability that i am going to propose",
    "is based on the concept of _ continuous substance _ , which might appear straightforward or even trivial to some readers , yet unfamiliar or even absurd to others .",
    "the idea of continuous substance has somewhat come out of fashion .",
    "many of us have become so highly accustomed to the concept of discrete particles , quantum jumps , and energy quanta , that they can hardly imagine continuous substances . to them , the very concept of measuring the _ quantity _ of existing stuff is rigidly tied to its discrete nature . there is , so they believe , _ more _ stuff of a particular kind contained within some region @xmath75 than there is stuff contained within another region @xmath76 if and only if there are _ more particles _ of that stuff in @xmath75 than there are in @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast , children do in general not have any problems when comparing the quantity of different heaps of continuous stuff .",
    "`` bob has more ice cream than me '' , little alice may be heard to complain , and we can hardly expect her to be aware of the discrete structure of matter . in her mind there seems to be an intuitive concept of a `` more '' relation between heaps of stuff that is not rigidly tied to the counting of particles .",
    "to this intuitive concept i would like to appeal .",
    "in the case of a discrete substance we can compare two heaps of substance by counting and comparing the number of discrete constituents ( particles ) of the heaps .",
    "this is not possible in the case of continuous substance .",
    "anyway , the notion of comparing quantities of substance should be applicable also in this case .",
    "if there is continuous substance distributed in space , then there should be a sense in which there is _ more _ substance contained within some region in space than there is contained within another region .",
    "being able to compare quantities of substance is a minimal requirement to justify the notion of _ substance _ itself .",
    "note that by _ substance _ we do not necessarily mean _ matter_. substance , in the sense that we shall be using the term here , simply means anything that is _ objectively existing in physical space_. it might be matter , but it might as well be energy or an electromagnetic field .",

    "let us leave open the question whether the physical space is the traditional @xmath77 or rather the configuration space or still some other space .",

    "@xmath87 times more substance contained within @xmath75 than within @xmath104_. it is exactly this ability to numerically measure and compare the amount of substance contained in different regions in space , which justifies the physical notion of `` substance '' .",
    "if different heaps of a substance could not be measured and compared with respect to their quantity , the term `` substance '' would be inadequate .",

    "@xmath91 of a substance contained in a given region in space is not to be confused with the cardinal number of mathematical points within that region . while the cardinality is the set theoretic number of elements in a given set , @xmath91 is the _ integrated spatial density _ of a substance in a given region in space , and as such it is not a property of space itself , hence not an _ a priori _ measure , but rather a property of the physical substance being distributed in space , hence an _ a posteriori _ measure",
    ". a typical _ a priori _ measure of space would be the _ spatial volume _ as provided by the lebesgue measure .",
    "in contrast , the substantial amount @xmath91 is an _ a posteriori _ measure that captures the contingent spatial distribution of a physical substance under consideration .",
    "different measures @xmath91 would correspond to different spatial distributions of the substance . yet , to speak of a substance @xmath80 being distributed in space _ is just _ to speak of a particular measure @xmath91 on that space , so that @xmath112 yields the substantial amount of @xmath80 contained within the region @xmath75 .",
    "the substantial density and accordingly the substantial amount are _ physical _ properties of a substance in the same manner that , say , energy is a physical property of a system .",
    "energy has no mathematical meaning ; it only has a mathematical _ form_. same with the substantial density and the substantial amount : they have a mathematical form , and this form has mathematical properties .",
    "but the _ meaning _ of these notions is physical .",
    "the substantial amount can be regarded as a straight generalization of the number of particles of a discrete substance , which can be seen by considering a substantial density of the form @xmath113 for some finite number @xmath43 of point - like particles located at positions @xmath114 .",
    "then , the substantial amount of stuff concentrated within a finite region @xmath75 is proportional to the number of particles contained within that region , @xmath115 thus , discrete substances are really just a special case where the substantial density has singularities , which form discontinuities of the substantial amount , and these discontinuities are identifiable as _ particles _ of the substance .",
    "if we consider the trajectories across configuration space corresponding to different worlds as physically existing , they constitute a continuous substance , and we can apply the above concepts , so that @xmath88 now measures the density of trajectories in configuration space , and @xmath91 measures the amount of trajectories contained within a given region in configuration space .      in his famous `` essay on probability '' , laplace @xcite introduced probability as the degree of certainty , or credence , to obtain a desired outcome from a finite set of possibilities . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath116 is the set of favorable outcomes and @xmath117 is the set of possible outcomes , then the probability to obtain a favorable outcome is defined as @xmath118 where @xmath119 counts the number of elements .",
    "there are numerous ways to justify laplace s rule , but most of them are circular .",
    "for example , deriving laplace s rule from an assumption of uniform probability on the set @xmath117 only shows that laplace s rule is _ consistent _ with probability theory .",
    "the very notion of probability itself , though , can not be derived from probability assumptions .",
    "what laplace had in mind was to postulate a quantity called `` probability '' that applies to a certain kind of situation where we have to quantify our degree of certainty that something is the case .",
    "whenever we are completely _ indifferent _ which one of a given finite set of possibilities is actually realized , then we ought to apply laplace s rule .",
    "this conception of probability is an _ epistemic _ conception , that is , it relates to the knowledge of an observer .",
    "two observers with distinct states of knowledge may attribute distinct probability distributions to the same set of possibilities .",
    "there is no objective probability distribution , so probability is nothing existing `` out there '' ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "i adhere to this conception of subjective probability , and i think it is all one needs to also understand the probabilistic aspect of quantum mechanics",
    ".    the direct translation of laplace s rule to the situation of an observer in an objectively existing multiplicity of worlds would be to take @xmath117 as the set of all worlds , because each world may possibly be the world of the observer .",
    "however , in the here - proposed theory there is a continuum of worlds , so there is no such thing as the `` number '' of worlds , and the ratio would be ill - defined .",
    "we , therefore , have to generalize laplace s rule to infinite sets , but how may this be reasonably accomplished ?",
    "laplace did not give any _ reason _ why the probability should be equal to the ratio ; he simply defined it so .",
    "so let us fancy a justification .",
    "if @xmath116 and @xmath120 are two sets of possibilities , and there are _ @xmath87 times more possibilities _ in @xmath116 than there are in @xmath120 , then it should be _",

    "then we should expect that @xmath122 the final step is then a convenient normalization of probability , @xmath123 , so that we obtain @xmath124 the advantage of these considerations is that they do not rely upon the sets to be finite .",
    "whenever there is a reasonable concept of an `` amount '' of possibilities provided by a measure @xmath91 on the set of all possibilities @xmath117 , then there is a related probability measure @xmath125 on @xmath117 .",
    "of course , for different measures @xmath91 we would obtain different probability measures @xmath125 , so there needs to be an independent justification why a certain measure @xmath91 is the relevant one .",
    "such independent justification can not be provided by mathematics alone but has to be a _",
    "justification obtained within the framework of a physical theory .",
    "the important thing to note is that the physical theory does not have to provide the probability concept itself .",
    "these are independent reasonings .",
    "the physical theory yields the justification for a measure @xmath91 , and then the probability considerations apply independently . in the finite case",
    "the measure @xmath91 is naturally provided by the number of possibilities , but what is the relevant measure in the case of uncountably many worlds ?    in section [ sub : trajectories ] we have seen that there is a one - to - one correspondence between worlds and trajectories in configuration space . thus , for every world @xmath20 there is a unique trajectory @xmath64 in configuration space , and this trajectory is parameterized by the time parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the trajectory point @xmath126 is then the configuration of the universe in the world corresponding to @xmath64 at time @xmath2 .",

    "we shall get some more into detail .      for systems of more than one particle ,",
    "the wavefunction is a function not in the three - dimensional space but in the @xmath50-dimensional configuration space .",

    "intriguingly , thus , quantum mechanics is a nonlocal theory , on account of the mathematical definition of locality , but it is a local theory with respect to _ einstein locality _ , which amounts to the assertion that superluminal signaling is impossible . in other words ,",
    "nature as described by quantum mechanics is _ epistemically local _ , that is , it appears to observers as local , in the sense that they can not communicate or gain information in a nonlocal manner , but _ ontologically _ , with respect to sheer existence , nature is nonlocal .",

    "now , there is a widely ignored problem with interpreting the configuration space @xmath52 as the physical space , and it is that the three spatial dimensions of each particle are lumped together into one column vector with @xmath50 components .",
    "while for most physicists this might appear rather unproblematic , it makes the theory vulnerable against a subtle but profound criticism put forward by monton @xcite .",
    "as the author writes , the problem is essentially ``  that nowhere in the 3n - dimensional space is it specified which dimensions correspond to which particles '' , which leads the author to conclude that `` the wave function ontology is an undesirable ontology for quantum mechanics '' .",

    "it would also apply to the here - proposed theory if one favors the configuration space as the real space in order to pronounce quantum nonlocality as a natural phenomenon .",

    "we then define the _ world amount _ by @xmath190 so the total amount of worlds @xmath191 is constant in time and equal to @xmath97 .",
    "physically , the constancy of @xmath191 means that there are no worlds being destroyed or created during the evolution of the universe .",

    "the wavefunction as a generating function of the world continuum contains two redundant parameters , which is the _ global scale _ and the _ global phase_. this is because the bohm equation is symmetric under the transformation @xmath193 for @xmath194 and @xmath195 , so the trajectories do not depend on the global scale and the global phase .",

    "the measurement process is modeled in the same way as it is done in bohmian mechanics , and in a similar way as in everettian mechanics , except that the `` pointer basis problem '' of everettian mechanics does not show up , because we can adopt from bohmian mechanics the concept of pointer states as spatially separated wave packets .",

    "depending on the measurement duration @xmath249 and on the separation of the eigenvalues @xmath69 , the coupling constant @xmath259 must be chosen large enough , so that condition is met .",

    "so far the objective description .",
    "in order to see what happens in a particular world , we have to go to the subjective description from the perspective of a particular observer joe .",

    "thus , from the moment right after the measurement , the wavefunction that governs the future fate of @xmath274 s world becomes _ subjectively _ equal to the collapsed wavefunction @xmath290 , although the wavefunction is _ objectively _ uncollapsed . from now on , since the schrdinger equation is linear , the future fate of @xmath274 s world is subjectively governed by the time - evolved collapsed wavefunction @xmath291 where @xmath278 .",
    "in contrast to everettian mechanics , there is _ _ _ _ no splitting of worlds__. before and after the measurement the total amount of worlds is the same and given by @xmath191 , no worlds are being created or destroyed , split or combined .",
    "what happens is that due to the measurement process , the configuration space is _ partitioned _ into smaller volumes that contain those worlds where the individual measurement outcomes occur . as the theory is deterministic at the level of individual worlds , which follows from the unique solvability of the bohm equation  , the measurement result obtained in each individual world",
    "is determined from the very beginning ( see @xcite for a similar view on determinism in quantum mechanics , including a critical review on the ideas proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "it only _ appears _ to be random to the individual observer who spends their lifetime in a particular trajectory without knowing which one .",
    "the conundrum of the splitting of persons that occurs in everett s theory does not show up ( see * ? ? ? * for an intriguing analysis making the splitting of persons less bizarre ) .",
    "concluding , the here - proposed theory explains ( 1 ) the subjective occurrence of probabilities , ( 2 ) their quantitative value as given by the born rule , and ( 3 ) the apparently random `` collapse of the wavefunction '' caused by the measurement process and by the subjective experience of individual observers , while remaining an objectively deterministic theory .",
    "let me discuss certain aspects of my approach , in particular with respect to theories , ideas and concepts found in the literature , which are more or less close to the ideas put forward here .",
    "the following topics are not ordered by their importance or by the similarity of the discussed concepts to my approach , but rather the ordering tries to follow a thematic thread .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for excellent reviews ) , there are conceptual differences between the two theories , in particular with regard to certain critical issues .    the first issue is related to the empirically undeniable statistical character of the measurement results . just like everettian mechanics , bohmian mechanics",
    "is a _ deterministic theory _ , and there seems to be _ prima facie _ no reason why the particles occupy one branch of the post - measurement state rather than another , with a probability whose value is precisely given by born s rule  .",
    "the proponents of bohmian mechanics argue that the probability that appears in born s rule is an _ _ epistemic _ _ quantity related to the ignorance of the observer concerning the _ _ initial particle configuration__. in analogy to classical statistical mechanics , so their argument , one must then introduce a _ probability density _",
    "@xmath88 on configuration space that captures the ignorance about the _",
    "actual _ configuration which is a result of the ignorance about the initial configuration .",
    "the predictions of bohmian mechanics are indistinguishable from those of conventional quantum mechanics , exactly if @xmath292 for some arbitrary initial time @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical laws then guarantee that   holds for all times @xmath2 , a feature that is denoted as _",
    "equivariance_. so , born s rule is replaced by relation   which , in lack of a derivation , has the status of a _ hypothesis _ , and it is called the _ quantum equilibrium hypothesis_. from there , with the help of the dynamical laws , the born rule can be derived , so it no longer exists as an additional postulate . there are attempts to derive the quantum equilibrium hypothesis at least in an approximative manner .",
    "valentini has shown that any arbitrary initial probability density on the configuration space becomes eventually indistinguishable from @xmath293 at a coarse - grained scale @xcite .",
    "his theorem is partly analogous to boltzmann s famous h - theorem , which motivates valentini to name his theorem the _ subquantum h - theorem_. drr , goldstein and zanghi propose to consider the quantum equilibrium as a feature of _ typical _ initial configurations @xcite .",
    "however , i do not consider these justifications of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis satisfactory , for reasons that go beyond the scope of this paper and have to be outlined separately . in the world continuum theory",
    ", there is no quantum equilibrium hypothesis , and all probabilities emerge as epistemic probabilities caused by the ignorance of the observer about which world it is that they live in .",
    "the second issue with bohmian mechanics may at first sight appear rather harmless , but on a closer look it develops considerable destructive power : the issue of _ empty branches_. these are the components of the post - measurement state that do not guide any particles because they do not have the _ actual configuration _ in their support . at first sight , the empty branches do not appear problematic but on the contrary very _ _ helpful _ _ as they enable the theory to explain _ _ unique outcomes _ _ of measurements .",
    "also , they seem to explain why there is an effective `` collapse of the wavefunction '' , like in standard quantum mechanics . on a closer view , though , one must admit that these empty branches _ do not actually disappear_. as in bohmian mechanics the wavefunction is taken to describe a _ really existing field _ , all their branches _ really exist _ and will evolve forever by the schrdinger dynamics , no matter how many of them will become empty in the course of the evolution .",
    "this circumstance has led david deutsch to famously phrase that `` pilot - wave theories are parallel - universes theories in a state of chronic denial '' ( @xcite ; this is a comment on @xcite ; for a follow - up discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "every branch of the global wavefunction describes a complete world which is , according to bohm s ontology , only a _ potential world _ that _ _ would _ _ be actual if only it were filled with particles .",
    "exactly one branch at a time is occupied by particles , thereby representing the _ actual world _ , while all other branches , though really existing as part of a really existing wavefunction , are empty and thus describe some sort of `` zombie worlds '' with potential planets , oceans , trees , cities , cars , and potential people who would talk like us and behave like us , but who do not _ actually exist_. the empty branches of the wavefunction are still _ real _ , because the entire wavefunction is considered to be _ real , _ but they have no further influence on the particles .",
    "so , is there any convincing justification to consider empty branches still as _ real _ , beyond mere stipulation ? why is the _ effective _ collapse of the wavefunction not a _ real _ collapse ?",
    "if a many - worlds theory may be accused of ontological extravagance , then bohmian mechanics may be accused of ontological _",
    "wastefulness_. because , _ _ on top of",
    "_ _ _ _ the ontology of the wavefunction with all its branches comes the additional ontology of particles , whose actual configuration degrades the reality of most of the branches of the wavefunction into mere potentiality . yet",
    ", the actual configuration is _ _ never needed _",
    "_ _ _ for the calculation of the statistical predictions in experimental reality , for these can be obtained by mere wavefunction algebra . in the world continuum theory ,",
    "in contrast , there is no such thing as _ the actual configuration_. all configurations in the support of the wavefunction are equally real , and the objective description of the universe does not need a specification of one of these configurations being the actual one .",
    "probability comes into play not as the ignorance of observers about which configuration is _ the actual one _ , but rather as their ignorance about which configuration is _ the configuration of their world _ , in a sense that is precisely specified by the here - provided logical framework .",
    "the third issue with bohmian mechanics is the separate existence of wavefunction and particles , and the strange way that these entities interact with each other .",
    "while the wavefunction acts upon the particles , the particles do not act upon the wavefunction .",
    "so actually , there is no _ _ inter__action between the wavefunction and the particles ; the relation is asymmetric .",
    "however , although the particles never act back on the wavefunction , it is always the particles that define the unique outcome of measurements ; it is the particles that define which branch of the wavefunction is the relevant one while the other branches become empty and can be neglected .",
    "so , although the particles have the last word , they are yet so powerless that they can not even act upon the wavefunction . in the world continuum theory , in contrast , there is no separate existence of wavefunction and particles , and no bizarre one - way `` inter''-action between these entities .",
    "there is only one unified physically existing entity , the world continuum , and the wavefunction is just an abstract mathematical construct that contains all information needed to determine the _ form _ of the world continuum .",
    "moreover , in the world continuum theory , particles are not point - like entities like in bohmian mechanics , but rather all particles together constitute a continuous substance , the world continuum , and it is just the time - world instances of the world continuum that appear as discrete point - like particles . in the world continuum theory , thus , the dualism between the continuum and the discrete , between wave and particle , is resolved in a unique fashion . concluding ,",
    "although being formally equal to bohmian mechanics in many aspects , the world continuum theory draws an entirely different picture of the physically existing universe .",
    "i will not say anything about the relation between mind and world that goes beyond the absolute minimum .",
    "`` if there exist many worlds '' , the opponent might ask , `` then why is it that we experience only one of them ? ''",
    "the simplest answer is : `` for reasons analog to those that make us experience only one time point as the present time '' .",
    "a more elaborate answer requires one to agree that perception is a conscious process , and that conscious processes _ supervene _ on physical processes .",
    "that is to say , a conscious process is taken to be _",
    "uniquely determined _ by physical processes .",
    "if all physical processes are given then all conscious processes are also given .",
    "as all physical processes are determined by the movement of the particles in the universe , a conscious process is eventually determined by the temporal evolution of the configuration of the universe , which is given in each world by the universal trajectory in that world . in some world",

    "how many `` states '' or `` universes '' are there , in that situation , two or infinitely many ? such ambiguity and vagueness about the ontological meaning of the terms `` states '' , `` branches '' , `` worlds '' , `` universes '' , is somewhat idiosyncratic for everett - type theories . in the here - proposed theory , in contrast , worlds correspond to well - defined trajectories in configuration space and hence their total number is always uncountably infinite , and spin states are just components of the wavefunction and not labels for , or representatives of , worlds .",

    "i conclude that tipler s approach is conceptually different from mine .",
    "bohmian mechanics can be formulated , so that the bohm equation obtains a newtonian form @xmath304 for @xmath153 , involving the so - called _ quantum potential _ @xmath305 and with the initial velocity of the particles being restricted by @xmath306 in this formulation , which was presented by bohm himself @xcite , it becomes explicit how the motion of the particles is affected not only by classical forces but also by non - classical forces generated by the quantum potential , which vanishes in the classical limit @xmath307 .",
    "since the quantum potential is a function of the density @xmath167 , bohm interpreted the non - classical force as the force that the wavefunction exerts on the particles .    in a very interesting approach , @xcite propose to replace the density @xmath74 in with the empirical density @xmath308 of a discrete number of trajectories , identified as _ worlds _ , so that @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the number of worlds .",
    "that way , the one - way interaction between the wavefunction and the particles becomes a two - way interaction between _ worlds _ , in that the evolution of each world configuration @xmath311 is directly determined by all other world configurations .",
    "if the worlds are distributed by a probability density equal to @xmath293 then for @xmath312 the world density @xmath308 approaches ( in a distributional sense ) the standard density , @xmath313 , hence the theory would reproduce the predictions of standard quantum mechanics in the limit of infinitely many worlds .",
    "i find this proposal very fascinating , as it shows that quantum effects can be explained by the interaction between _ physically existing worlds_. i have only three criticisms .",
    "one is that i would prefer to call the relation between worlds not _ interaction _ but rather _ interference _ , because the difference between interaction and interference seems to me a categorical one .",
    "interaction is a relation between _ systems _ , while interference is a relation between _ worlds _ , that is , between trajectories of one and the same system .",
    "for example , an electron in a double - slit experiment _ interacts _ with the walls of the double - slit and with the detection screen behind the slits . on the other hand , a trajectory of the electron passing through one slit _ interferes _ with the trajectories of the same electron passing through the other slit .",
    "if one of the slits is closed , then the trajectories of the electron can not pass the region covered by the closed slit , and all trajectories go through the open slit , interfering with each other and producing a typical single - split diffraction pattern on the screen when the experiment is repeated many times .",
    "when the second slit is opened , the trajectories of the particle may pass both slits , and behind the double - slit they _ interfere _ with each other , producing a typical double - slit interference pattern on the screen . in each world there is only one trajectory passing through only one of the slits , but since the course of that trajectory is influenced by other trajectories , each belonging to a separate world , one is led to conclude that the typical wave phenomena of particles can be interpreted as the influence that individual worlds exert on one another .",
    "this special kind of mutual influence between worlds is different in nature from ordinary interactions between systems and , therefore , so my suggestion , should be distinctively identified as _",
    "interference_.    my second criticism of the approach of @xcite is , of course , that they assume a finite number of worlds . for one part ,",
    "if the predictions of standard quantum mechanics are reproduced in the limit of infinitely many worlds , then why not taking infinitely many worlds ?",
    "the here - proposed theory already involves right from the start an infinite number of worlds while being mathematically much simpler than the proposal by @xcite .",
    "the world continuum theory may be regarded as the limiting theory obtained from the many - interacting - worlds ( miw ) theory of @xcite by taking the number of worlds to infinity .",
    "my third criticism is that the miw relies , like bohmian mechanics , on a probability assumption .",
    "only if it is assumed that the finitely many worlds are at @xmath62 spatially distributed by @xmath314 , in the sense of a _ probability _ distribution , the predictions of standard quantum mechanics are approximately reproduced .",
    "thus , it is impossible to conceptually _ derive _ probability from the miw .",
    "nonetheless , the authors claim that the worlds are equally weighted , so that a probability argument analog to that of laplace would be applicable ( _ ibid _ , p 041013 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it is a remarkable feature of the miw approach that only a simple equal weighting of worlds , reflecting ignorance of which world an observer occupies , appears to be sufficient to reconstruct quantum statistics in a suitable limit . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    at a closer look , there are two types of probability brought into play here .",
    "one is the probability @xmath141 that world @xmath315 is the world of the observer , and the other is the probability density @xmath316 to find at time @xmath62 the configuration of world @xmath315 at @xmath57 . due to the observer s complete ignorance which world",
    "it is that they live in , the probability @xmath141 is equally weighted , so @xmath317 . in the same vein",
    ", the probability density @xmath318 is assumed to be equal for all worlds , so @xmath319 .",
    "importantly , while each world is given the same probabilistic weight with respect to its bare identity , which can be justified by an ignorance assumption , its possible configurations are _ not _ given the same probabilistic weight .",
    "some configurations are more probable than others , and there is no simple ignorance argument for such a non - trivial probability assumption .",
    "so my criticism is that the authors conceal a non - trivial and not justified probability assumption concerning the configuration of the world of the observer by a trivial and justified probability assumption concerning the bare identity of the world of the observer .",
    "they do not address the following question : why are some configurations more probable than others , and where does that non - uniform probability come from ? as a side remark : it does not help in this respect to formally parameterize the worlds by some parameter @xmath320 , so that @xmath320 becomes uniformly distributed , as is done by schiff and porier in their approach , which is conceptually very close to mine @xcite . for , the explanatory burden is now shifted towards answering the question : where does that parameterization come from ? it appears _ ad hoc _ to introduce a specific parameterization of worlds only to get the probability distribution over the new parameter @xmath320 uniform , as long as there is no _ physical _ justification for doing so .",
    "why should the observer apply the laplacian rule of indifference towards some fictitious parameter @xmath320 , when it is really and only the positions of particles , that is , the _ configuration _ of the world , which he can ( in principle ) measure ?",
    "the parameter @xmath320 is a merely theoretic , not an empirical , quantity that depends on the probability distribution over the possible world configurations , so it would be circular to use it for a derivation of that very probability distribution .    as i have argued in section [ sub : beyond - laplace ] , there is an epistemological explanation for the occurrence and the numerical values of quantum mechanical probabilities when interpreting @xmath293 not as a probability density but rather as the _ substantial density _ of a physically existing continuum of worlds .",
    "probability can then be conceptually derived , in a manner analogous to the classical derivation by laplace , from both the physical facts ( the empirically given distribution of the world continuum ) and the observer s indifference towards which one out of the continuously many worlds is actually the world of the observer .",
    "the configuration of the world of the observer is more likely to be found near the location @xmath57 than near another location @xmath321 exactly if @xmath322 , since at @xmath321 the worlds are _ more densely packed _ than at @xmath321 . as a discrete analogue",
    ": it is more probable to find a particular needle out of many needles in a haystack if you look at those places where there are more needles .",
    "you do not even have to _ know _ the distribution of needles in the stack . the probability to find your needle _",
    "is _ , as a matter of physical _ fact _ , bigger when you ( accidentally ) look at places where there are more needles . the probability itself is epistemic , but it derives from ontological facts .",
    "now , the interpretation of @xmath293 as a substantial density of worlds is impossible when considering an only finite number of worlds . as such",
    ", the substantial density is an empirical distribution , and if there were only finitely many worlds , the empirical distribution had to be a finite sum of delta functions , which does not apply for @xmath293 .",
    "@xcite considers a large but finite number of worlds in his proposal of a _",
    "newtonian qm_. he completely removes the wavefunction from the theory , leaving only the density @xmath172 and the velocity field @xmath323 , which together yield the flow @xmath324 . with the wavefunction having been removed , the newtonian equation for the movement of the particles can",
    "not , as in bohmian mechanics , be interpreted as the action of a classical potential and a quantum field on each particle . instead , the equation seems to describe the action of a classical potential and a classical continuous fluid described by the density @xmath88 on each particle .",
    "however , according to sebens construction of the theory , there is no continuous fluid but just a finite number of worlds , and the density @xmath88 is just an approximation obtained by averaging over a large enough number of worlds .",
    "hence , as sebens points out , can not be considered a fundamental equation , so that empirically testable deviations may occur .",
    "furthermore , as the wavefunction is no longer there to put restrictions on the density and the velocity field , there are combinations of the latter two that do not correspond to any underlying wavefunction and , therefore , do not represent empirically adequate scenarios . to restore the empirical adequacy of the theory ,",
    "sebens introduces an additional postulate , the `` quantization condition '' , which holds that @xmath325\\right\\ } = nh.\\ ] ] sebens admits that he has no satisfying justification for the additional postulate other than that it would naturally follow if one presumes the existence of an underlying wavefunction .",
    "however , with the wavefunction existing _ in addition _ to a large number of worlds , the theory blows up to an ontologically extravagant theory , _ prodigal qm _ , which does not offer interpretational advantages against standard bohmian mechanics .",
    "therefore , he introduces the wavefunction again , though holding that it does not represent a physically existing entity itself , but rather `` a convenient way of summarizing information about the positions and velocities of particles in the various worlds '' ( _ ibid _ , p. 9 ) .",
    "i find sebens approach and his interpretational analysis particularly useful in that it clearly shows at which points problems occur that have to be addressed by additional conceptual work .",
    "my own conclusions are : 1 ) to accept that there is a continuous infinity of worlds corresponding to bohmian trajectories ( here i differ from sebens ) , and 2 ) to interpret the wavefunction not as a physically existing field in addition to particles and worlds , but rather as a generating function for , and , therefore , as a mathematical representation of , a physically existing entity that already _ entails _ particles and worlds ( which is more or less what sebens also concludes ) .",
    "perhaps the approach closest to my proposal is poirier and schiff s reformulation of bohmian mechanics @xcite . in a sense ,",
    "their formulation and mine are two formulations of the same theory , only emphasizing different aspects of it .",
    "while my formulation puts a focus on the interpretation of the density function @xmath88 , as well as on the ontological and epistemological aspects of the theory , poirier and schiff s formulation explores formal aspects and their physical relevance .",
    "their main result is that one may completely get rid of the wavefunction , leaving only the trajectory function @xmath63 and the initial density function @xmath326 as a complete representation of the history of a closed system . at first",
    ", @xcite showed that the entire dynamics of a 1d system is captured by a partial differential equation ( pde ) for the trajectory function @xmath63 , involving temporal derivatives @xmath327 as well as spatial derivatives @xmath328 .",
    "he then showed that the system dynamics can be expressed in terms of a minimal - action principle on a generalized lagrangian density of the form @xmath329=\\rho_{0}(q)l[q,\\xi,\\dot{\\xi},\\xi',\\xi'',\\xi'''],\\ ] ] with the lagrangian @xmath330=\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{\\xi}^{2}-v[\\xi]-q[q,\\xi',\\xi'',\\xi'''],\\ ] ] and a rather complicated quantum potential @xmath128 .",
    "@xcite generalized the theory to the many-@xmath93 case , and they also considerably simplified @xmath128 and the pde by re - parametrizing the trajectory function @xmath331 to @xmath332 with the parameter @xmath320 being chosen so that it uniformizes the probability density @xmath333 to @xmath334 , where @xmath335 .",
    "the relevance of their work to the understanding of quantum mechanics is profound . for one part",
    "it shows that a complex - valued wavefunction need not be considered an indispensable ingredient to quantum theory . for another part , and alongside with @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the work of poirier and schiff shows that quantum phenomena can be regarded as being caused by the interaction ( or , as i would prefer to call it , by the interference ) of a multitude of equally existing trajectories . for , if one were to reject the idea of equally existing trajectories , then one would have to justify how and in what sense a lonely existing trajectory can possibly interact ( or interfere ) with other , non - existing , trajectories .",
    "although in my approach the wavefunction is still there , it is degraded to a mere `` generating function '' for the physically existing trajectories , with no reality on its own . in this respect ,",
    "both of our approaches go beyond what bohm and his adherents had , respectively , have in mind .",
    "the trajectories are the same in all three theories , and they form a continuum , so this is common ground , too .    however , what porier and schiff did not fully work out , and what is more closely addressed in my approach , is the physical meaning of the collection of trajectories and of the density function .",
    "porier and schiff refer to the collection of trajectories as an _ ensemble _ , which , however , remains a rather ambiguous reference . in statistical theories , an _ ensemble",
    "_ is a hypothetical , infinite collection of independent realizations of a random variable , and the probability distribution associated with the outcomes of the variable governs the relative frequencies of individual realizations within the ensemble .",
    "a statistical ensemble is in any case countably infinite , even for a finite number of possible values of the random variable under consideration .",
    "for example , the ensemble associated with a fair coin would be an infinite sequence of heads and tails , with the relative frequency of heads within a partial sequence converging towards one half as the length of the partial sequence goes to infinity .",
    "this is certainly not the concept of _ ensemble _ that poirier and schiff intend to invoke .",
    "rather , their `` ensemble '' of trajectories is the uncountably infinite collection of _ all possible _ trajectories , which are parameterized solutions of one and the same differential equation . in terms of a statistical theory ,",
    "their `` ensemble '' would rather represent the ( uncountable ) collection of all possible _ outcomes _ , not a ( countable ) collection of _ realizations _ , of a random trajectory .",
    "the density function @xmath88 would then represent the probability density on the collection of possible trajectories , with only one trajectory being realized .",

    "finitely - many - worlds theories based on the conception of worlds as trajectories in configuration space , are axiomatically _ more _ demanding than the world continuum theory , as they must specify , in addition to the wavefunction , the trajectories @xmath362 of those worlds that are taken as real , so that the objective state of the universe at time @xmath2 is given by @xmath363 for @xmath310 representing the number of objectively existing worlds , and with @xmath364 being the trajectory of the @xmath315-th world , whose configuration at time @xmath2 is given by @xmath311 . in the case @xmath365 one obtains bohmian mechanics .",
    "the here - proposed world continuum theory , in contrast , just needs the wavefunction @xmath175 to mathematically represent a continuum of trajectories and hence worlds , which are the solutions of the bohm equation .",
    "therefore , in the world continuum theory , just as in everettian mechanics , the complete history of the universe is specified by the wavefunction alone .",
    "in contrast to everettian mechanics , however , there is no ambiguity concerning the identity of the worlds , as they are given by precisely defined trajectories . to explain the empirical fact of the unique outcomes of measurements",
    ", the world continuum theory needs an _ actual configuration _ , just like bohmian mechanics , but it is taken as _",
    "epistemic _ rather than _",
    "ontic_. it specifies not _ the _ actual configuration of the universe , but rather the configuration that is actual _ to a particular instance of an observer_. with respect to _ his or her _ experience , and only so _",
    "_ , _ _ there is a unique measurement outcome and an actual configuration of the universe .",
    "in essence , a complete objective description of nature that complies with the empirical facts , requires also taking into account the subjective _ experience _ of nature .",
