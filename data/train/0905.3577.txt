    "one of the long - standing problems of modern strong - interaction physics is the origin of quark confinement @xcite .",
    "recently , results from theory and from lattice simulations @xcite have indicated the existence of a class of models based on @xmath0 gauge theories in which confinement can be understood using semiclassical arguments .",
    "the essential feature of this class of models is the deformation of the underlying gauge theory in such a way that the effective potential for the polyakov loop is minimized in a confining phase in which the polyakov loop apparently breaks @xmath0 to @xmath8 .",
    "the form of the polyakov loop in this phase in turn leads to the existence of monopole solutions , and an explicit connection between monopoles and confinement along the lines developed by polyakov @xcite .    in this class of models ,",
    "at least one euclidean direction is taken to be compact , of length @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath9 is decreased from infinity , the pure gauge theory undergoes a deconfining phase transition at a critical value of @xmath9 .",
    "confinement is restored for small @xmath9 by a deformation of the pure gauge action .",
    "the simplest deformation which does this is an addition to the gauge action of terms non - local in the compact direction @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations of this model are consistent with a smooth connection of the high - temperature confining phase to the confining phase of the pure gauge theory . a local action with similar properties is obtained by adding dirac fermions in the adjoint representation to the gauge action , and it is this model we will consider here .",
    "the novel feature of this model is that the adjoint fermions are given periodic boundary conditions in the finite direction , rather than the standard antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "recent lattice simulations of @xmath10 with periodic adjoint fermions @xcite observe many of the same features seen in @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the compact direction as the timelike direction , writing @xmath9 as @xmath11 , suggesting a system at finite temperature @xmath12 .",
    "this is slightly misleading , because the transfer matrix for evolution in the compact direction is not positive - definite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the timelike direction imply that the generating function of the ensemble , _",
    "i.e. _ , the partition function , is given by@xmath13\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the fermion number . this graded ensemble , familiar from supersymmetry",
    ", can be obtained from an ensemble @xmath15 $ ] with chemical potential @xmath16 by the replacement @xmath17 .",
    "this system can also be viewed as a gauge theory with periodic boundary conditions in one compact spatial direction of length @xmath18 . from this point of view",
    ", the transfer matrix is positive - definite , and the partition function is dominated by the ground state energy .",
    "we will use the language of finite temperature gauge theory because of the well - developed relation between @xmath2 symmetry breaking and the confinement - deconfinement transition .",
    "finite temperature gauge theories are advantageous in many respects for the study of confinement .",
    "the polyakov loop operator @xmath19 , given by@xmath20\\ ] ] represents the insertion of a static quark into a thermal system of gauge fields .",
    "it is the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in pure @xmath0 gauge theories , with @xmath21 in the confined phase , and @xmath22 in the deconfined phase .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition is associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath2 symmetry @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the generator of @xmath2 .",
    "the unbroken @xmath2 symmetry of the confined phase leads to a rich set of conditions that expectation values must satisfy .",
    "the character @xmath25 of each irreducible representation of @xmath0 transforms as @xmath26 under @xmath23 for some @xmath27 . in the confined phase , the expectation value @xmath28 is @xmath29 for all representations that transform non - trivially under @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , have @xmath30 . for each representation",
    "@xmath31 with @xmath30 , there is a timelike string tension @xmath32 associated with the large - distance behavior of the correlation function@xmath33.\\ ] ] on physical grounds , it is generally believed that all representations with the same non - zero value of @xmath6 have the same string tension @xmath34 .",
    "this timelike string tension @xmath34 can be measured from the behavior of the correlation function @xmath35\\ ] ] at sufficiently large distances , where @xmath36 represents the potential energy between widely separated groups of @xmath6 quarks and @xmath6 antiquarks .",
    "thus the study of confinement at finite temperature using the polyakov loop largely reduces to the study of @xmath2 symmetry and the existence of a mass gap in polyakov loop two - point functions , as opposed to the area law for wilson loops appearing in confinement at zero temperature .",
    "the addition of adjoint representation fermions to @xmath0 gauge theories preserves the global @xmath2 symmetry of the action . with normal antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions ,",
    "the perturbative effective action for the polyakov loop shows that the deconfined phase is favored at high temperature . as the adjoint fermion mass decreases from infinity , the critical temperature of the deconfinement transition decreases .",
    "with periodic boundary conditions for the fermions , however , this class of field theories can avoid the transition to the deconfined phase found in the pure gauge theory for sufficiently light fermion mass and high temperatures .",
    "if the number of adjoint fermion flavors @xmath37 is less than @xmath38 , these systems are asymptotically free at high temperature , and therefore the effective potential for @xmath19 is calculable using perturbation theory . as shown below",
    ", the system will lie in the confining phase at high temperature if the adjoint fermion mass @xmath1 is sufficiently light and @xmath39 .",
    "evidence from lattice simulations indicates that the high - temperature confining region is smoothly connected to the low - temperature confined phase of the pure gauge theory @xcite , indicating a continuous change in string tensions from one region to the other . in the high - temperature confining region , electric string tensions can be calculated perturbatively from the effective potential , and magnetic string tensions arise semiclassically from non - abelian magnetic monopoles .",
    "thus the high - temperature confining region provides a realization of one of the oldest ideas about the origin of confinement .",
    "the following section describes the calculation of the effective potential , and demonstrates the realization of confinement at high temperature .",
    "section iii derives the temporal string tensions via a perturbative expansion around the confining minimum of the effective potential . in section iv",
    ", we discuss spatial string tensions as measured by spatial wilson loops . as in the classic treatment of the three - dimensional adjoint higgs model by polyakov @xcite , monopoles are responsible for confinement . following the recent work of unsal and yaffe @xcite , we are able to calculate semiclassically the spatial string tensions , which exhibit a new string tension scaling law .",
    "a final section discusses our results and their possible confirmation by lattice simulation .",
    "an appendix details a mathematical identity useful for calculating the effective potential in the confined region .",
    "consider a boson in a representation @xmath31 of the gauge group with spin degeneracy s moving in a constant polyakov loop background @xmath19 .",
    "the one - loop effective potential at non - zero temperature and density is given by @xcite @xmath40\\ ] ] where periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "with standard boundary conditions ( periodic for bosons , antiperiodic for fermions ) , 1-loop effects always favor the deconfined phase . for the case of pure gauge theories in four dimensions , the one - loop effective potential can be written in the form @xmath41 where the trace is over the adjoint representation .",
    "this series is minimized , term by term if @xmath42 , so @xmath2 symmetry is spontaneously broken at high temperature .",
    "the same minima are obtained for any bosonic field with periodic boundary conditions or for fermions with antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the use of periodic boundary conditions for the adjoint fermions dramatically changes their contribution to the polyakov loop effective potential . in perturbation theory ,",
    "the replacement @xmath17 shifts the matsubara frequencies from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "the one loop effective potential is now that of a bosonic field , but with an overall negative sign due to fermi statistics @xcite .",
    "the sum of the effective potential for the fermions plus that of the gauge bosons gives@xmath45.\\ ] ] note that the first term in brackets , due to the fermions , is positive for every value of @xmath46 , while the second term , due to the gauge bosons , is negative .",
    "the largest contribution to the effective potential at high temperatures is typically from the @xmath47 term , which can be written simply as@xmath48\\left[\\left|tr_{f}p\\right|^{2}-1\\right]\\ ] ] where the overall sign depends only on @xmath37 and @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath50 and @xmath49 is sufficiently small , this term will favor @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath49 is sufficiently large , a value of @xmath19 from the center , @xmath2 , is preferred .",
    "note that an @xmath52 super yang - mills theory would correspond to @xmath53 and @xmath54 giving a vanishing perturbative contribution for all @xmath46 @xcite . in that case , non - perturbative effects lead to a confining effective potential for all values of @xmath11 . in the case of @xmath50 ,",
    "each term in the effective potential will change sign in succession as @xmath1 is lowered towards zero .",
    "this suggests that it should be possible to obtain a @xmath2 symmetric , confining phase at high temperatures using adjoint fermions with periodic boundary conditions or some equivalent deformation of the theory .",
    "the existence of a @xmath2 symmetric , confining phase at high temperatures has been confirmed in @xmath10 , where both lattice simulations and perturbative calculations have been used to show that a gauge theory action with an extra term of the form @xmath55 is confining for sufficiently large @xmath56 at arbitrarily high temperatures @xcite .",
    "this simple , one - term deformation is sufficient for @xmath57 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , in the general case , a deformation with at least @xmath58 $ ] terms is needed to assure confinement for representations of all possible non - zero @xmath6-alities .",

    "it is interesting to study the stability of the high - temperature confined region as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "myers and ogilvie have determined the phase diagram as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath5 up to @xmath87 by numerically minimizing @xmath86 as a function of all the polyakov loop eigenvalues @xcite .",

    "when @xmath5 is not prime , there are typically phases where @xmath2 center symmetry is spontaneously down to @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a factor of @xmath5 . in the case of @xmath5",
    "even , the confined phase gives way to a phase with unbroken @xmath90 symmetry as @xmath49 increases .",
    "the phase with unbroken @xmath91 is the `` least deconfined '' of the partially confining phases . in the appendix",

    "thus , we see that for any given @xmath97 and @xmath5 , there is a range of values of @xmath1 for which the system is in the confined phase .    for @xmath98 , the one - loop potential favors the deconfined phase , so there must be at least one phase transition as @xmath49 is varied . in the case of @xmath57 , there is indeed a single phase transition separating the confined and deconfined phases .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the transition is first - order between the high - temperature confined region and the deconfined phase .",

    "the one - loop potential predicts that one or more phases separate the deconfined phase from the confined phase . in the case of @xmath10 , a single new phase",
    "is predicted , and has been observed in lattice simulations . for higher values of @xmath5",
