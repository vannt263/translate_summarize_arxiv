    "the density pdf is a powerful tool for analysing astrophysical systems ; in both non - gravitating and strongly self - gravitating systems , it reveals key aspects of the underlying physical processes . for supersonic non - gravitating turbulent gas in an isothermal environment",
    "the density pdf is log - normal @xcite . when self - gravity becomes important , the probability of finding dense regions increases and a power - law tail develops on the high - density side of the pdf @xcite .",
    "recent observations of column - density pdfs support these theoretical predictions @xcite .    the density pdf can be used to evaluate key aspects of star formation , like the efficiency and the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we develop a model for the evolution of the density pdf , based on free - fall collapse .",
    "we start with the initial density pdf of a gaseous system , not specifying its spatial structure , nor how it evolved to this state .",
    "we then evolve the system in time with two approximations . in the first one we apply the free - fall analysis directly to the density pdf . in the second approach",
    "we assume that the system can be described by an ensemble of free - falling homogeneous spheres , such that the subsequent time evolution is solely determined by the collapse of the individual spheres .    using the time evolution of the pdf ,",
    "we derive the free - fall accretion rate , defined as the rate at which gas evolves above an arbitrary threshold density .",
    "this accretion rate can then be tuned to serve as an estimate for the star formation rate .",
    "the model is compared to observations of star - forming regions taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observed star formation rate is consistent with the values of the free - fall model at early stages of the collapse .",
    "comparing the observed column density pdfs with our model suggests that the star - forming cores are in free - fall .",
    "and the exact solution of equation  [ eq : exact - ff - solution].,width=302 ]    we begin with a review of the analytic solution for a uniform - density sphere in free - fall . the time evolution of the density can then be described by a simple approximate function and applied to the density pdf .",
    "the radius , @xmath2 , of such a sphere obeys @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is newton s constant , @xmath5 is the mass of the sphere , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the initial density and radius of the sphere at time @xmath8 , and the collapse starts from rest . using the free - fall time , @xmath9 as the characteristic time , and defining the dimensionless radius @xmath10 , and the dimensionless time @xmath11 , one obtains the equation , @xmath12 with initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "this can be solved to give @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this equation can not be inverted analytically , but a good approximation for @xmath17 can be obtained by setting @xmath18 equation  [ eq : approx - ff - solution ] deviates least from the exact solution ( equation  [ eq : exact - ff - solution ] ) if we substitute @xmath19 , and figure  [ fig : error - approx - solution ] shows the error , @xmath20 , that results from this and other substitutions .",
    "inverting equation  [ eq : approx - ff - solution ] yields @xmath21 we note that free - fall proceeds very slowly at the beginning .",
    "after 50% of a freefall time the radius has decreased by only 16% , and after 99% of a freefall time the radius is only an order of magnitude smaller . assuming the mass in the sphere , @xmath22 , to be constant during the collapse , equation  [ eq : approx - radius - solution ] gives @xmath23 with this equation",
    ", we can now explicitly compute the density as a function of time starting with an initial density @xmath6 .",
    "we note that a sphere with initially uniform density maintains the uniform density distribution during the entire free - fall collapse .",
    "in addition , the time derivative of the density , which we need later , is given by @xmath24 where we introduce @xmath25 to simplify many of the equations .",
    "the density pdf gives a statistical description of the distribution of density in a system . in the previous section we described a single sphere with uniform density distribution ,",
    "whose pdf is a dirac @xmath26 function , @xmath27 . in the following",
    "we therefore consider a large ensemble of uniform density spheres with different initial densities @xmath28.we must distinguish between the ( volume - weighted ) density pdf and its corresponding mass - weighted distribution , @xmath29 @xmath30 the distributions are normalised to the total volume , @xmath31 , and the total mass , @xmath32 , respectively , such that the integral over the pdf is unity , @xmath33 .    for free - fall from rest ,",
    "the density is a monotonic function of time such that , if we consider two separately collapsing uniform spheres having initial densities @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then for all times @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 , @xmath38 , i.e. the evolutionary paths , @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not cross .",
    "we can use this mathematical property to derive an analytic description for the time evolution of the density pdf . for a ( large )",
    "set of independently collapsing spheres with different initial densities we obtain an initial density pdf , for which we can use the discretisation illustrated on figure  [ fig : pdf - ff - time - evol - sketch ] . due to the conservation of probability density , the area of a bin on this plot stays constant over time , and so @xmath41 starting with an arbitrary but fixed @xmath42 at time @xmath43 , the value for @xmath44 at time @xmath45 can be calculated from the analytic function for @xmath46 , as demonstrated below .",
    "we can transform @xmath47 to @xmath48 using @xmath49 combining this with equation  [ eq : vw - pdf - time - evolution ] , we obtain @xmath50    the bin width @xmath44 can be written in terms of @xmath42 , @xmath6 and @xmath36 , using equation  [ eq : approx - density - solution ] , @xmath51 in the limit as @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 where we have defined @xmath54 for convenience in subsequent analyses .",
    "we now make use of the simple approximation for @xmath46 ( equation  [ eq : approx - ff - solution ] ) , to derive the time evolution of the density pdf and , in particular , we focus on the high - density part . in this context",
    ", it is convenient to use logarithmic scaling .",
    "specifically we need to determine @xmath55 as a function of density , @xmath56 , and time , @xmath36 .",
    "the high - density slope of the pdf is then given by the limit as @xmath57 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : pdf - time - evol - split ] is @xmath58 and vanishes as @xmath57 , because the second term in the brackets dominates .",
    "for the first term on the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : pdf - time - evol - split ] we need to distinguish between @xmath47 and @xmath48 . using equations  [ eq : vw - pdf - time - evolution ] and [ eq : mw - pdf - time - evolution ] the derivative for the first case takes the form @xmath59 and for the latter one it takes the form @xmath60 the term containing @xmath54 in equations  [ eq : pdf - vw - split ] and [ eq : pdf - mw - split ] reads @xmath61 and diverges as @xmath57 , because of the first term in the brackets .",
    "this means that at late times ( @xmath57 ) the right - hand sides of equations  [ eq : pdf - vw - split ] and [ eq : pdf - mw - split ] are both dominated by the second term , @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , as long as it is finite , the slope of the initial pdf has very little influence on the late - time evolution of the high - density tail .",
    "finally , the last term in equation  [ eq : pdf - mw - split ] is given by @xmath63 the slope of the high - density tail of the pdf at time @xmath36 is calculated by multiplying the individual terms and taking the limit for @xmath57 .",
    "as long as the slope of the initial pdf is finite , this yields slopes @xmath64 @xmath65 hence , at late times the tail of the pdf has a universal slope , independent of the slope of the initial pdf , provided this is finite . substituting @xmath19 , the slopes of the tail are @xmath66 for @xmath47 , and @xmath67 for @xmath48 .",
    "it is remarkable that the slope of the initial pdf does not influence the slope of the tail at late times .",
    "this can be understood by examining the evolution of a discretised bin of the pdf ( see figure  [ fig : pdf - ff - time - evol - sketch ] ) . moving from low to high densities",
    ", the width of the bin is stretched .",
    "rewriting equation  [ eq : time - evol - factor - q ] as a function of density contrast @xmath68 ( see equation  [ eq : approx - density - solution ] ) , and computing the limit for large density contrast , we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "this means that the initial slope is stretched over @xmath70 orders of magnitude for every order of magnitude that the density contrast increases .",
    "thus , initial features of the pdf are stretched out and become negligible by the time the gas reaches high density .",
    "what remains is then the result of _ how _ bins are stretched .",
    "this stretching is given solely by the intrinsic properties of gravity , encrypted in the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : example - pdf - evolution - high - dens - tail ] , where we plot late - time density pdfs for two different initial functions , one starting with a log - normal pdf , and one with a sinusoidal pdf , where we followed the evolution according to our approximate relations ( equations  [ eq : approx - radius - solution ] and  [ eq : approx - density - solution ] ) .",
    "in addition , we perform a monte - carlo simulation of independent collapsing spheres .",
    "we set up an ensemble of spheres with initial radii @xmath72 and densities @xmath73 such that the combined density pdf is log - normal .",
    "the number of spheres is varied from @xmath74 to @xmath75 per ensemble .",
    "we then let the spheres start to collapse simultaneously and follow the time evolution of the radius according to equation  [ eq : approx - radius - solution ] and the density according to equation  [ eq : approx - density - solution ]",
    ". spheres with higher initial density collapse quickly leading to the formation of the power - law tail as expected .",
    "once a sphere @xmath76 with initial density @xmath77 has collapsed entirely ( @xmath78 ) , we exclude it from the ensemble .",
    "figure  [ fig : monte - carlo - high - dens - slopes ] shows the measured pdfs after @xmath79 of the gas is collapsed . after an initial formation phase ( see figure  [ fig : lognormal - tail - development ] ) the tail of the pdfs shows the expected slope until the majority of the spheres have collapsed and the distribution is dominated by fluctuation effects due to small number statistics .",
    "up to this point , we only considered the spherically symmetric collapse of a sphere with uniform density and the collapse of an ensemble of spheres in the monte - carlo simulation , respectively .",
    "however , both real as well as simulated systems of gravitationally unstable gas are more complicated .",
    "there are many physical aspects that influence the gaseous region such as turbulence , self - gravity , magnetic fields , chemical , or thermal effects . as the main assumption of our model is the condition of free - fall",
    ", we need to discuss whether this condition is fulfilled in real and simulated systems , respectively .        on of the most important processes in the fragmentation of a gaseous region",
    "is turbulence @xcite .",
    "turbulent motions create a hierarchy of structures that break up ordered systems into smaller subsystems .",
    "turbulent regions are therefore not spherically symmetric and do not have uniform density distributions as a whole .",
    "rather , they form elongated structures with local overdensities as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : hydro - turblence - with - cores ] , a column density snapshot from a hydrodynamical simulation of self - gravitating turbulent gas .",
    "the large - scale supersonic motions break up and cascade down to transsonic motions in the dense cores , which is confirmed by theory as well as observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once the densest cores start collapsing by passing the jeans instability ( see appendix  [ sec : thermodynamics ] ) , the collapse from cores down to stars , i.e. , the star formation process , occurs within a free - fall time .",
    "although the individual fragmentation of cores is still a matter of debate , there is a consensus that the collapse time scale in real and simulated systems is the free - fall time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it seems appropriate to apply a free - fall model .",
    "apart from the fact that cores collapse in free - fall one can ask whether the fragments of a collapsing sphere can again be described by a sphere , i.e. , whether the fragmentation in this idealised picture is self - similar .",
    "@xcite found that perturbations in the density structure of a uniform sphere lead to fragmentation of the sphere and that all perturbing wavelengths grow equally .",
    "the resulting fragmented structure will thus depend on the fourier transform of the perturbation field .",
    "if one assumes perturbations of equal amplitude in random directions , the resulting pattern in real space reveals clumpy roundish structures .",
    "@xcite extended the work by @xcite and investigated the fragmentation of a uniform spheroid .",
    "they conclude from a linear perturbation analysis that the spheroid most likely fragments by slicing parallel to the axis .",
    "the lack of spherical symmetry also leads to the conclusion that the dominant perturbations are of the order of the jeans length or larger , resulting in a small number of large fragments rather than in a large number of small fragments .",
    "all together it seems reasonable to assume that the collapsing and fragmenting sphere breaks up into large clumpy objects that are unstable themselves , i.e. , that the fragmentation can be assumed roughly self - similar .",
    "the slope of the tail of the pdf has been measured in numerical simulations of turbulent self - gravitating clouds . in the high - density collapsing regime",
    "the pdf is observed to subscribe to a power - law , @xmath80 .",
    "the slope was measured for the first time by @xcite who found @xmath81 , which agrees very well with our analytic prediction .",
    "high - resolution simulations by @xcite reveal a slope of @xmath82 at intermediate to high densities , and @xmath81 at very high densities .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed simulations of magnetised clouds , and find slopes ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , steeper than in the purely hydrodynamic case ; the stronger the magnetic field , the steeper is the tail of the pdf",
    ".    we can understand this behaviour qualitatively by investigating the influence of the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "although @xmath71 is introduced as a simple mathematical device , to match the approximate function ( equation  [ eq : approx - ff - solution ] ) to the true collapse solution , we can mimic other physical effects by changing its value .",
    "figure  [ fig : collapse - radius - different - a ] shows the radius of the collapsing sphere , and its time derivative , as a function of time for different values of @xmath71 .",
    "it would be ideal to have a complete description and derivation of the slope of the pdf as a function of initial collapse velocities incorporated in the initial differential equation  [ eq : free - fall - dgl ] .",
    "however , the simple approximation and the subsequent derivative of the slope of the pdf is not possible any more in an analytic way .",
    "we therefore stick to this crude approximation to newton s law .",
    "for @xmath85 , the collapse is delayed initially , but speeds up towards the end .",
    "this is qualitatively what happens in marginally unstable density regimes , where the early phase of the collapse is still influenced by stabilising effects like thermal pressure or magnetic fields . at later stages of the collapse",
    ", gravity becomes increasingly dominant .",
    "hence , structures with different densities are influenced differently by stabilising effects .",
    "the collapse of gas with initial density @xmath86 is more strongly delayed than the collapse of gas with initial density @xmath87 .",
    "this results in a larger stretching of the density bin @xmath88 , compared with the case of free - fall .",
    "the larger the stabilising effects , e.g. , the magnetic field strength @xcite , the larger is the stretching and the steeper the tail .",
    "conversely , the tail is shallower if collapse is faster than pure free - fall .",
    "this is the case in converging flows , where the collapse does not start with zero velocity , but instead with an initial converging velocity field @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion rate is defined as the rate at which mass evolves above a threshold density @xmath89 . in the free - fall approximation",
    "this is @xmath90 and the problem is to evaluate the derivatives on the right side of equation  [ eqn : accnrate ] , as functions of @xmath89 and @xmath36 .",
    "following the argument in section  [ sec : analytic - description ] allows us to express the first term on the right hand side as a function of @xmath91 , where @xmath45 corresponds to the time , when the gas reached the density @xmath89 .",
    "it is important to note that the bins of constant volume in figure  [ fig : pdf - ff - time - evol - sketch ] do not conserve mass over time .",
    "the first term on the right side of equation  [ eqn : accnrate ] therefore needs to be adjusted to ensure mass - conservation of the system .",
    "the mass of the bin increases by a factor of @xmath92 which we have to correct for yielding @xmath93    in order to determine the rate at which mass evolves above @xmath89 at time @xmath36 , we need to solve for the initial density @xmath6 that evolves to @xmath89 at this time , i.e. to solve @xmath94 and obtain @xmath95 .",
    "if we set @xmath96 , equation  [ eq : approx - density - solution ] can not be inverted analytically to obtain @xmath95 .",
    "however , if we set @xmath97 ( which still only deviates from the exact collapse solution by less than @xmath98 , see figure  [ fig : error - approx - solution ] ) , equation  [ eq : approx - density - solution ] becomes @xmath99 and can be inverted analytically to give @xmath100    this solution for @xmath101 can then be used to calculate @xmath48 ( equation  [ eq : mw - pdf - accretion - time - evolution ] ) and the time derivative of the density ( equation  [ eq : density - time - derivative ] ) , for substitution into equation  [ eqn : accnrate ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : accretion - plus - error ] shows the resulting accretion rate , and the deviation arising from using the approximate solution ( equation  [ eq : approx - ff - solution ] ) with @xmath102 , in place of the exact solution ( equation  [ eq : exact - ff - solution ] ) .",
    "the dip in the lower plot is due to the switch from a positive to a negative deviation .    , and the fractional deviation between this rate and the exact solution.,width=302 ]",
    "although according to our approximation the high density slope is unaffected by the functional details of the initial pdf , we need to adopt an initial functional form of the pdf in order to apply the free - fall model to the accretion rate of a collapsing system .",
    "isothermal non - self - gravitating gas develops a log - normal pdf in response to driven supersonic turbulence ( see introduction ) .",
    "although astrophysical systems are often not isothermal and are always self - gravitating , a significant fraction of the interstellar medium is dominated by kinetic motions . under this circumstance ,",
    "thermal effects and self - gravity play a minor role , and the density pdf approximates to a log - normal form @xcite .",
    "this overall highly dynamical state of clouds and cloud complexes seems to be in contrast to our model of collapsing spheres from rest .",
    "however , the large scale turbulent motions cascade down to transsonic or even subsonic motions , such that many of the dense cores that populate the high - density extreme of the pdf appear to start their collapse from relatively quiescent initial conditions , in which the turbulence is at best transsonic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our assumption of a negligible net effect of the initial turbulence on the contraction of the spheres is clearly a deficiency that needs to be extended in a future work with a more general theory .",

    "the column - density pdf for the central region ( 3 ) shows a flat power - law tail at high column - densities , with slope @xmath164 , corresponding to free - fall conditions .",
    "in contrast , the column - density pdf for the quiescent region ( 6 ) appears not to be contracting at all .",
    "we have developed an analytic description for the evolution of the density pdf , based on free - fall collapse of a sphere .",
    "we use a simple analytic approximation to describe the collapse in closed functional form . from this",
    "we derive the slope of the high - density tail of the density pdf , and the star formation rate as a function of time .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows .    * in the freefall approximation , the high - density tail of the density pdf asymptotes to a power - law with slope @xmath165 for the ( volume - weighted ) density pdf , and @xmath166 for the mass - weighted equivalent .",
    "the only condition is that the initial density pdf , at the start of the collapse , have finite slope . *",
    "the power - law tail appears first at high densities and steadily extends to lower densities as time proceeds .",
    "if the initial density pdf at the beginning of the collapse is known , the star formation efficiency can be related to the threshold density at which the high - density tail begins .",
    "* physical processes that retard the collapse in marginally unstable density regimes , such as thermal pressure or magnetic fields , steepen the slope of the high - density tail .",
    "although these retarding processes are not explicitly included in our analysis , we can mimic them by varying the parameter @xmath71 in the approximate collapse solution .",
    "conversely , processes that accelerate the collapse , relative to free - fall , such as driven converging flows , flatten the high - density tail of the pdf .",
    "* we derive analytic descriptions for the free - fall accretion rate , based on the density pdf .",
    "the corresponding star formation rates are highly sensitive to the initial width of the density pdf .",
    "star - forming regions with low turbulent motions , corresponding to narrow density pdfs , lead to retarded star formation and low star formation rates . in contrast , highly turbulent systems , corresponding to broad density pdfs , result in an early and fast star formation process , i.e. , a bursting mode of star formation . *",
    "comparisons to observations of star - forming regions are in reasonably good agreement with our model .",
    "the observed star formation rates are consistent with the model during the early stages of collapse , i.e. , for a very low star formation efficiency . assuming that observed clouds approximate to spherical symmetry , the power - law tails of their column - density pdfs suggests that they are contracting with speeds close to free - fall .",

    "we can estimate the stability of a cloud with the jeans analysis .",
    "the critical mass above which thermal effects can not prevent the gravitational collapse is the jeans mass @xcite , @xmath167 computed as a sphere with the diameter of the jeans length , @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath170 the temperature , @xmath155 the molecular weight of the gas , @xmath171 the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath56 the average density of the cloud .",
    "the important relation to note is the dependency of the jeans mass on the temperature and the density . in molecular clouds ,",
    "the temperature decreases with increasing density as shown in figure  [ fig : temperature ] up to a density of @xmath172 and stays roughly constant above that threshold up to a density of @xmath173 . as a result , the jeans mass decreases with a scaling of @xmath174 below @xmath172 and @xmath175 between @xmath176 . for a non - fragmenting cloud with constant mass",
    "this means that the cloud becomes more unstable during the collapse and the assumption of free - fall collapse becomes more appropriate during the collapse . if a cloud fragments into many subsystems and the mass of the individual fragments decreases faster due to fragmentation than the density increases due to the collapse , the free - fall approximation eventually breaks .",
    "depending on the degree of fragmentation , our analysis might break down for certain systems .",
    "however , the fragmentation of clouds is a subject on its own as it depends on the properties of the turbulence , the physical processes involved , and the initial conditions , which goes beyond the scope of this paper . at this point",
    ", we therefore stick to the simplified jeans analysis and the conclusions concerning the stability .",
    "for a spherically symmetric power - law density distribution with exponent @xmath142 , @xmath177 the ( volume - weighted ) density pdf takes the form @xmath178 and mass - weighted equivalent @xmath179 hence , there is a logarithmic scaling with the density , @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively .",
    "the projected column density distribution reads @xmath182 from this we can derive the area - weighted column - density pdf , @xmath183 and mass - weighted column - density pdf , @xmath184 the corresponding logarithmic scalings are @xmath185 and @xmath186"
