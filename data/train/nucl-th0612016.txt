    "one of the main challenges in theoretical nuclear physics is a microscopic description of the properties of finite nuclei , using realistic nuclear forces . for a given interaction model ,",
    "appropriate observables showing impact on different features of the nuclear potential need to be tested in a many - body system through direct comparison with experimental data . in few - particle systems , where the quantum many - body problem of nucleons can be solved exactly both for bound and scattering states",
    ", one has an optimal setting to probe off - shell properties of different potentials .    for photodisintegration of light nuclei ,",
    "exact calculations predict a slightly different behavior when using different two - body realistic interactions , while a more evident effect of three - body forces is found . however , the experimental situation is still unsatisfactory , as the data are not sufficiently precise to discriminate clearly among different interactions models . among light nuclei ,",
    "the photoexcitation of the alpha particle has recently attracted much attention both in theory , where a calculation with realistic two- and three - body forces was carried out @xcite , and in experiments @xcite , where the aim was to further clarify whether @xmath1he exhibits a pronounced giant dipole resonance or not , a question that was raised in the first microscopic calculation of the reaction @xcite , where semirealistic two - body forces where used .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data do not yet lead to a unique picture . nevertheless , a comparison of the impact on observables of different potentials on a theoretical level is already instructive .",
    "these exact calculations of the photodisintegration cross section can also offer valuable theoretical guidance in a class of astrophysical studies .",
    "nuclear absorption of high - energy @xmath4-rays through excitations of giant resonances may potentially become an important diagnostic tool for the dense environments of compact astrophysical sources .",
    "for example , black holes emit an intense high - energy @xmath4-ray continuum , against which nuclear absorption features would uniquely probe the baryonic - matter density , and possibly some compositional information , near the source .",
    "since the dependency on the potential model used in our calculations turns out to be small in comparison to the discrepancy in experiments , our precise microscopic reaction calculations can help to investigate interstellar gas , mostly isotopes of hydrogen and helium , surrounding the astrophysical @xmath4-ray source @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the total photodisintegration cross section of light nuclei using the potential constructed within the unitary correlation method ( ucom ) , denoted with @xmath2 .",
    "this is aimed at testing for the first time this interaction in a continuum reaction , where many disintegration channels are open , and simultaneously studying the capability of describing electromagnetic reactions via non - local two - body interactions _ versus _ local two - and three - body models .",
    "exact calculations are performed making use of the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) approach  @xcite , which enables to fully take into account the final state interaction , while circumventing the difficulties arising from the continuum many - body scattering states .",
    "the problem is in fact reduced to the solution of a bound - state - like equation , which we solve with an hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) basis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "different models for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction are found in the literature , as _",
    "e.g. _ the argonne v18 potential ( av18 ) @xcite , the cd bonn @xcite and the nijmegen @xcite potentials .",
    "these modern two - body interactions reproduce the experimental nn data with high precision , but they underbind nuclei with @xmath5 .",
    "this drawback has traditionally been overcome introducing phenomenological three - body forces fitted to reproduce experimental binding energies and first excited states of light nuclei .",
    "furthermore , chiral perturbation theory can provide a systematic way to build two- , three- and more - body forces @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned potential models , including two- and three - body forces have been used to calculate bound state properties of light nuclei ( up to @xmath6 and more ) , mainly within the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method @xcite and the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) approach @xcite .",
    "however , the addition of a three nucleon potential requires a very intensive computational effort when used in many - body systems . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that different , but phase equivalent two - body interactions are related by a unitary non - local transformation .",
    "it is expected that the addition of non - locality to the nn interaction could reduce or even cancel the need of three - body force , leading to a big simplification of many - body calculations .",
    "based on this idea , a new category of nn potentials has then emerged , among them one can recall : ( i ) the inside non - local outside yukawa ( inoy ) interaction by doleshall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , ( ii ) the j - matrix inverse scattering potential ( jisp ) by shirokov _",
    "_ @xcite and ( iii ) the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) by feldmeier _",
    "the @xmath2 potential derived from the av18 interaction has already been used as universal input in quite a variety of many - body techniques , ranging form hartree - fock calculations @xcite , to random phase approximation @xcite and to nuclear structure calculations in the framework of fermionic molecular dynamics , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .    in the ucom framework",
    "the dominant short range - correlations , induced by the repulsive core and by the tensor part of the nn interaction , are explicitly described by a state independent unitary transformation . when the correlation operator is applied to the hamiltonian , a phase - shift equivalent correlated interaction is obtained .",
    "a correlated operator is defined via a similarity transformation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the unitary radial and tensor correlation operators , respectively .",
    "the correlator @xmath10 introduces a radial distance - dependent shift which keeps nucleons away from each other when their uncorrelated distance is smaller than the range of the strongly repulsive core of the nn interaction .",

    "the effect of this approximation was tested in the framework of ncsm , where one can perform exact few - body calculations @xcite .",
    "in particular , in this reference it was shown that the omitted three- and more - body terms of the cluster expansion can be tuned changing the range of the tensor correlators in order to compensate the genuine three - body force to a large extent , still preserving the phase shift equivalence . the value of the tensor `` correlation volume '' @xmath16 fm@xmath0 ( for details see @xcite ) was found to give the best description of binding energies of @xmath0h and @xmath1he on the tjon line . in this paper",
    "we will use this very same value of @xmath18 in order to investigate whether the non - local two - body @xmath2 interaction , that minimizes the effect of three - body forces on the binding energies , can also describe the continuum photoabsorption cross section .    as already pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "phenomenological non - local interaction terms introduce modifications on the electromagnetic current operator , conserved by gauge invariance .",
    "in fact , if the nuclear potential @xmath19 does not commute with the charge operator , then two - body currents , usually called meson exchange currents ( mec ) , have to be introduced , for consistency . in case of phenomenological non - local potentials the explicit construction of a consistent mec",
    "could be rather involved .",
    "the study of electromagnetic reactions at low energies , where one can use the siegert theorem ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , allows to investigate the role of implicit electromagnetic exchange mechanisms without requiring an explicit knowledge of the two - body current operator . for this reason ,",
    "the test of a given potential model on the prediction for photoabsorption cross section is very important .",
    "the total photoabsorption cross section is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and , at low photon energy @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the inclusive unpolarized dipole response function , generally defined as : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 indicate the total angular momentum of the nucleus in its initial ground state and its projection , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote wave function and energies of the ground and final states , respectively .",
    "the dipole operator is @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the third components of the position in the center of mass reference frame and isospin of the @xmath32-th particle , respectively .",
    "the dipole approximation has been proven to be very good at low photon energy for the deuteron @xcite and for the triton case @xcite . with the dipole operator the major part of the meson exchange currents ( mec )",
    "is implicitly taken into account , via the siegert theorem .    in the lit method @xcite",
    "one obtains @xmath23 after the inversion of an integral transform with a lorentzian kernel @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the unique solution of the inhomogeneous `` schrdinger - like '' equation @xmath35 because of the presence of an imaginary part @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and the fact that the right - hand side of this equation is a localized state , one has an asymptotic boundary condition similar to a bound state .",
    "thus , one can apply bound - state techniques for its solution .",
    "the response function @xmath23 is recovered via an inversion of the integral transform of eq.([2 ] ) ( for inversion methods see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) . up to now",
    "this method has allowed calculations of electromagnetic reactions for @xmath0h and @xmath0he @xcite and recently even for @xmath1he @xcite with realistic two- and three - body forces .",
    "nuclei with six- @xcite and even seven nucleons  @xcite have been investigated with semirealistic interactions .",
    "a similar formalism has been applied to describe exclusive electromagnetic processes in the four - body system with semirealistic potentials @xcite .",
    "recently , the method has been also applied to the harmonic oscillator basis in the framework of ncsm @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the lit using an hh expansion of the internal wave function . for the antisymmetrization of the wave function we make use of the powerful algorithm developed by barnea _",
    "_ @xcite . the hh approach , which is natural in coordinate space for a local interaction , has been recently extended to the use of non - local potentials given in terms of two - body matrix elements between harmonic oscillator ( ho ) states @xcite , like the jisp potential . in this paper",
    "we will make use of the same method using as input the correlated ho matrix elements of the av18 potential , constructed within the ucom .",
    "[ sec : results ] we begin the discussion with the results for the ground state energies of @xmath1he and @xmath0h calculated in the hh expansion with @xmath2 .",
    "even if the starting point is the local av18 potential , the correlated @xmath2 contains derivative operators . in principle",
    ", one could extend the hh formalism to the use of such terms and consider the rather involved operator form of the @xmath2 , the result being a more intensive numerical computation for each matrix element .",
    "the alternative approach we use , consists in representing the two - body potential operator on an ho basis , similarly to the case of the jisp potential .",
    "the input of our hh calculation are the correlated relative two - body ho matrix elements , @xmath37 where @xmath11,@xmath38 and @xmath39 are radial quantum number , orbital angular momentum , spin and total angular momentum of the two - body sub - system , respectively ( isospin is omitted for the sake of simplicity ) . in the operator form",
    "the ucom is independent on the ho parameters , therefore the ho representation should be viewed as a parameterization rather than a formulation of the potential .",
    "in fact , we expand the two - body potential as @xmath40 the sum over two - body quantum numbers @xmath41 and @xmath42 has to be performed up to maximal value of @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the radial quantum number and angular momentum , respectively .",
    "the expansion has to be pushed forward , till independence of observables , like binding energies , on the ho parameters is reached .",
    "we find out that good convergence of the angular part is reached with @xmath45 , while at least @xmath46 oscillator quanta are needed for the radial part .",
    "since we work in an hyperspherical harmonics many - body hilbert space , convergence as a function of the hyperspherical grand angular momentum @xmath47 needs to be further investigated .",

    "the @xmath2 potential predicts a very similar @xmath48 for @xmath0h and a lower @xmath48 for @xmath1he .",
    "this fact is also reflected in the size of the radii of eq.([oddo ] ) . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we summarize the situation : for @xmath0h we present only the proton radius , since the there is no proton - proton radius , while for @xmath1he we show the squared mass radius ( @xmath50 if isospin mixing is neglected ) and @xmath51 .",
    "one can see that @xmath2 leads almost to the same proton radius as av18+uix within a @xmath52 deviation , but smaller radii for the alpha particle are obtained , if compared to av18+uix . a consequence of that is the lower @xmath1he peak cross section found with @xmath2 with respect to av18+uix .",
    "the trk sum rule is of interest since it contains information on the exchange mechanisms induced by the non - commuting part of the potential @xmath53 .",

    "_ @xcite are unfortunately too big to allow us to discriminate among the different potential models .    in case of the alpha particle the experimental situation is more involved .",
    "close to threshold several data were taken in different experiments , which unfortunately show fairly large discrepancies . only the data from arkatov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite cover a larger energy range .",

    "finally , at higher energies the measurements are precise enough to conclude that av18+uix and @xmath2 can explain , within the error bars , the photoabsorption cross section , in contradistinction to the jisp potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that a possible reason of this discrepancy of the jisp model could be due to the probably incorrect long range part of the potential , whose construction is not constrained by the meson exchange theory . regarding this issue",
    "we can only state that @xmath2 , which explicitly contains the long - range pion exchange term of av18 , unchanged by the short range action of the correlations , exhibits a correct tail behavior in the photoabsorption cross section of light nuclei . here",
    "we would also like to point out that the consideration of large hilbert spaces ( large @xmath47 and @xmath43 ) is essential to achieve a stable and ho - independent result on the whole photon energy range .",
    "the fact that the jisp potential is constructed on a small ho basis , for defined @xmath43 and @xmath58 values , could limit the correct description of the tail of this sensitive observable .",
    "we have presented the results of an _ ab initio _ calculation of the @xmath0h , @xmath0he and @xmath1he photodisintegration cross section with the @xmath2 potential .",
    "the difficulty of the scattering continuum problem is circumvented via the lorentz integral transform method , where the final state interaction is fully taken into account .",

    "the sensitivity of the photoabsorption cross section on non - local terms of the interaction is investigated . with respect to the traditional local av18 potential , a reduction of the peak and an enhancement of the tail of the cross section",

    "the comparison between the av18+uix potential model and @xmath2 allows to investigate , whether the omission of a genuine three - body force can be replaced by a non - local interaction on a continuum observable .",
    "though binding energies of very light nuclei are well described by @xmath2 with a @xmath59 difference with respect to the av18+uix model , the situation is different in the photodisintegration cross section below pion threshold .",
    "our analysis shows that the @xmath2 potential leads to a very similar result as the av18+uix for high photon energy , while in the region close to threshold larger differences are found , particularly in case of @xmath1he .",
    "the larger deviation in @xmath1he with respect to the @xmath0h case could be related to the fact that smaller mean square radii are obtained with the @xmath2 .",
    "the higher density of the alpha particle makes it certainly more sensitive to characteristic short range properties of the three - body force and non - local parts of the nn interaction , magnifying the differences .",
    "the similarity of the high - energy cross section shows that also in the continuum genuine three - body forces can be partly simulated with the non - local @xmath2 potential .",
    "but the differences found at low - photon energies point out that the two potential models are not completely equivalent .",
