    "ion traps have promising potential in the field of quantum information science @xcite , and in particular micro - structured paul traps are well suited for this purpose .",
    "they can have multiple zones for trapping , processing and storing of atomic ions @xcite .",
    "scaling such traps up for quantum information processing requires a large number of independent high bandwidth , low noise voltage signals .    in this approach , a register of quantum bits ( qubits )",
    "is stored in the internal states of laser - cooled trapped ions ( forming a wigner crystal ) , and in some implementations in motional states of their normal modes @xcite .",
    "wigner crystals of increasing length become difficult to cool and to protect against environmental influences and thus are subject to decoherence .",
    "this is detrimental for tasks that rely on the computational power of quantum superpositions and entanglement . splitting the quantum register into crystals of manageable size and entangling them on demand in a quantum network",
    "is regarded as a promising and straight - forward solution .",
    "this can be achieved in segmented ion traps where storage , shuttling and processing zones @xcite are realized by a large number of dc electrodes .",
    "these type of traps are often regarded as a prerequisite to scalable quantum information processing using trapped ions .",
    "specific implementations of such a partitioned quantum register require shuttling of ions in order to be able to exchange information between independent crystals and this is ideally done with low heating of the motional state @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by shuttling of the ions in an adiabatic fashion , at the expense of long shuttling times @xcite , or in an tailored diabatic way which can be optimized for low heating @xcite .",
    "the latter requires voltages with a fast update rate .",
    "another building block of this type of quantum information processing is splitting and merging strings of ions , again requiring precise control over a large number of voltages @xcite .",
    "various proposals for processing quantum information exist , among others the network model @xcite , or measurement based quantum computation @xcite , relying on highly entangled graph states , which could be generated in ion traps @xcite .    shuttling and the tailoring of interactions",
    "can not only be done by manipulating the dc voltage , but also the rf voltage used for radial trapping of an ion string @xcite .",
    "a general purpose quantum processor would be a field programmable trap array ( fpta ) .",
    "independent arbitrary time - dependent potentials ( e.g. , sums of dc and rf voltages ) can be applied to each element of the fpta , allowing for the creation of arbitrary trapping potentials ( compared to designs optimized for a fixed lattice @xcite ) and the investigation of various lattice types and quantum simulations thereof with a single programmable trap ( a similar concept is discussed in ref.@xcite ) . for certain types of ions and trap sizes the device presented here already fulfills all the necessary requirements . this type of application might require  depending on the selected ion and trap design  higher amplitudes or update rates than supplied by the device described here , and , to reduce heating , narrow band filtering of the rf component .    similarly , quantum simulators require a high degree of control to simulate the features of other quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the interaction between trapped ions could be tailored to mimic an entirely different quantum system , for example by shaping the axial trapping potential @xcite .",
    "this application , too , requires a large number of independent voltages .",
    "furthermore , in the field of experimental quantum optics , laser fields are often used to manipulate the internal or motional state of atoms , and need to be shaped in time and space . shaping the temporal profile of laser pulses",
    "can be realized using acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) , where control signals can be used to generate arbitrary amplitude and frequency patterns of a laser @xcite .",
    "the spatial profile of a laser beam can be manipulated by a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , typically implemented as a liquid crystal display ( lcd ) or digital micro - mirror devices .",
    "the slms often take digital signals for control using pulse width modulation , but analog implementations exist @xcite potentially requiring again a large set of independent voltages . in the same fashion",
    "the spectral and accordingly temporal profile of large bandwidth lasers and frequency combs can be manipulated @xcite .",
    "other applications in the quantum optics community , for example , the generation of control signals to shape magnetic or dipole traps for neutral atoms @xcite and using slms for wave front sensing , adaptive imaging , and holography also require a large number of individual voltages .",
    "commercially available devices do not meet the requirements of precise enough voltages combined with a fast update rate as needed for quantum optics experiments .",
    "this article reports on the design , development , and characterization of a scalable , fast and multichannel arbitrary waveform generator ( mawg)@xcite that meets the requirements of advanced quantum optics experiments .",

    "the full depth of the dp - sram is divided into 16 logical segments of 8k words each , which in practice reduces the width of address bus to access the memory from 16 to 4 bits and hence results in a reduced digital noise on the daughter - card at the expense of discrete access to the memory only at start - addresses of the 16 segments @xcite .",

    "an exemplary command sequencer is given in table[table : datacmdexample ] .",
    "a few exemplary chosen demo - waveform signals generated by the mawg are displayed in fig.[fig : waveforms ] to demonstrate capability of the mawg .",
    "fig.[fig : waveforms]a presents an abrupt change of voltage from the minimum to the maximum accessible value which shows the amplitude span , the large slew rate , and no visible ringing .",
    "fig.[fig : waveforms]b presents a sequence of small fast voltages steps with 80ns dwell time demonstrating the large bandwidth .",
    "fig.[fig : waveforms]c shows the generation of an arbitrary waveforms ( here a bessel function ) .",
    "fig.[fig : waveforms]d presents a triangular waveform showing a good linearity of the output .      the low - noise op - amp ( ad8021 ) has a linear output current limit of 70ma which determines the maximum output voltage amplitude depending on the value of the termination resistor . a resistor value that needs the amount of current larger than the specified current limit of the op - amp will cause saturation of the output voltage .",
    "on the other hand , for higher bandwidth output a proper impedance matching between the shielded - pair transmission - line ( with characteristic impedance of 110@xmath0 ) and the termination resistor value on the end of the line is obligatory to minimize the output - signal distortion due to signal reflections . as depicted in fig.[fig : termination_drift]a the impedance matching scheme with 120@xmath0 termination resistor provides a maximum signal amplitude range of 8.5v . * * though , for low - speed signals of less than 1msps * * , * * the termination resistor can be increased to 333@xmath0 , resulting in a less demand for the driving current and consequently providing higher maximum signal amplitude of nearly 10v practically without compromising the signal waveform quality .",
    "the measured output impedance of the mawg channel , determined from fig.[fig : termination_drift]a at half of the maximum signal amplitude , amounts to 65@xmath0 .",
    "another op - amp ( ths4631d ) is tested to provide higher current and hence higher output voltage resulting in maximum output voltages of 13v and 11v for the low- and high - speed signals respectively and an output impedance of 45@xmath0 and a thermal dependence of around 200v / c .",

    "the characterization of the device and results presented are based on the op - amp ( ad8021 ) with a termination resistor of 333@xmath0 .",
    "the mawg device has a linear output signal amplitude behaviour over full range of the operation .",
    "a discrepancy between the expected and obtained voltages is found to be below 4mv with a standard deviation of 0.81mv ( possibly limited by the measurement device ) .",
    "the discrepancies vary randomly among different channels due to manufacturing imperfections of the components and can be compensated by a software calibration of each channel . the main contribution to the output voltage discrepancy",
    "is the offset of the output voltage , which results from an intrinsic op - amp input - offset - voltage of typically 0.4mv which results in 4mv after amplification .",
    "the mawg device is characterized by dynamic update rates from 25msps down to dc - signal generation .",
    "long - term stability of dc output signals is of particular interest for applications in quantum information processing .",
    "the static operation of the mawg channel is determined mainly by the performance of our dac component , which is specified by the vendor for output signal update rates from 1msps to 200msps .    in the _ stopped - clock _ mode of operation the updating of the dac",
    "is suspended during static output voltages , resulting in an idle state of digital switching .",
    "this mode reduces the clock noise on the output signal at the expense of a voltage drift of up to several mv for long term operation with some variations among different channels . on the other hand , in the _ continued - clock _ mode of operation ,",
    "the dac is updated continuously with a user - defined clock and hence gives an output voltage with higher stability , however with a tradeoff on noise .",
    "an output signal fluctuating around the set voltage with a maximum deviation less than 150v over a period of 2h and long term drift with a slope below 10v / min is observed when the clock is operated with the minimum specified clock update rate of 1mhz ( fig.[fig : termination_drift]b ) .",
    "a combined operation of both modes can be used to get optimum performance .",
    "for example , in a particular experiment , the device can be operated in the _ stopped - clock _ mode to get the low - noise output during the measurement and then can be switched to the _ continued - clock _ mode to get the low - drift output during waiting time between two consecutive measurements .",
    "the overall thermal dependence of the mawg output voltage is around 70v / c and is measured by a gradual increase of temperature by up to 14c starting from the ambient air temperature .",
    "the analysis of the mawg output voltage noise is based on the spectral noise density ( snd ) @xmath1 of the device measured with the _ stopped - clock _ mode of operation .",
    "the snd of the mawg is determined for the full range of its output voltages by taking several voltage spectra for different dc output voltages , whereas a wider spectral range from 1hz to 200mhz was covered by using two different spectrum analysers and later concatenating the resulting spectra for each of the cases ( fig.[fig : snd_2d_3d]a ) .",
    "the snd spectra are calculated using the relation    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the noise voltage and rbw is the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyser for a particular frequency scan .",
    "the snd spectra of the output of a channel of the mawg , in the _ stopped - clock _ mode of operation , as a function of the frequency are shown in fig.[fig : snd_2d_3d]a for a couple of positive and negative output voltages .",
    "the spectrum labelled as `` 333@xmath0 '' is taken using the bare load - resistor and represents noise contributions from the measurement .",
    "the spectra show discrete contributions mainly from 50hz and its harmonics in low frequencies .",
    "some additional noise components are visible at frequencies higher than 1mhz which are identified as a combined effect of power supply output and pick - up of externally generated radio frequencies .",
    "the smooth noise floor of the output voltage has a direct dependence on absolute output voltage up to a frequency of 100khz whereas for rest of the observed spectrum this dependence is negligible .",
    "a measurement for the mawg input noise density including power supply output and the 2 m long , multi - pole , interconnect cable is plotted in fig.[fig : snd_2d_3d]b which explains the peaks present in the spectra at higher frequencies and hence can be avoided by using a storage power supply and/or implementing a proper low - pass filter at output of the mawg . in the following analysis ,",
    "contributions appearing above 100khz are therefore neglected .",
    "the increasing noise floor with increasing output voltage ( fig[fig : snd_2d_3d]c ) is caused by an asymmetry between two complementary output currents of the dac ( see section [ sub : a - channel ] ) which are symmetric for 0v output and become asymmetric otherwise .",
    "the asymmetry increases proportionally to the absolute value of the output voltage .",
    "a noise cancellation between complementary outputs occurs in the differential op - amp , with a maximum noise reduction for the symmetric case and a lower otherwise . on the other hand ,",
    "the noise floor for each of the output voltage settings decreases strongly with rising frequency . in fig.[fig : snd_rms_snr]a the snd is shown as a function of channel output voltage at a couple of frequencies ( other than the frequencies corresponding to the 50hz harmonics ) .",
    "the root - mean - square noise @xmath4 of a channel of the mawg is calculated using the relationship    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the difference of two consecutive frequencies obtained in the snd measurements .",
    "the output voltage noise @xmath4 as a function of the output voltage ( @xmath7 ) for different frequency spans is plotted in fig.[fig : snd_rms_snr]b which shows a linearly increased @xmath4 with increase in output voltage amplitude of the mawg and reaches a maximum level of nearly 250v at 9v for the frequency span of 100khz .",
    "similarly an increased frequency span results in a corresponding increase in the root mean square noise which remains consistent for all different output voltages .",
    "the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the mawg output is calculated for different output voltages using the relationship    @xmath8    the snr as a function of output voltage @xmath7 is plotted in fig.[fig : snd_rms_snr]c for the same frequency spans .",
    "the dependence of the snr on the output voltage is more pronounced for higher bandwidth whereas for constant bandwidth the dependence is strongest on smaller voltages .",
    "the bandwidth of 100khz has a snr greater than 90db for the output voltages larger than 2v .",
    "the mawg is a general purpose dac - based system designed to provide multichannel voltage signals characterized by the high dynamic range of both signal amplitude and signal update rate , as well as by a low signal noise and a very good long - term signal stability .",
    "the mawg is characterized by a large range of signal amplitudes of up to 9v , a wide dynamic range of update rates from 25msps down to dc signal generation , as well as a low signal - to - noise ratio of + 90db and long - time stable output signal amplitude within 0.3mv .",
