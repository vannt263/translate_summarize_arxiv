    "k - dwarfs are ideal for galactic chemical evolution studies because they are not biased by stellar death ( lifetimes of k - dwarfs are greater than the age of the galaxy ) .",
    "these cool dwarf stars have convective envelopes and , therefore , they experience granulation ( small - scale convective motions associated with temperature and density fluctuations ) in their photospheres .",
    "however , classical model atmospheres of k - dwarfs ( e.g. , atlas , marcs ) are static and homogeneous , i.e. , incompatible with granulation , yet they are extensively used in stellar abundance work .",
    "granulation affects line profiles and line strengths , which are the basis for chemical abundance determinations from stellar spectra .",
    "severe inconsistencies in k - dwarf abundance studies for key elements such as fe and o have been reported recently in the literature ( e.g. , morel & micela 2004 , schuler et al .",
    "2006 , ramrez et al .",
    "2007 ) , which may originate in the inadequacy of standard spectral line - formation calculations that use classical model atmospheres",
    ".    we aim at detecting and quantifying the signatures of granulation in very high resolution spectra of k - dwarfs .",
    "the doppler shifts introduced by the convective motions result in asymmetric absorption line - profiles whose central wavelengths are shifted with respect to their rest values ( e.g. , allende prieto et al .",
    "2002 , dravins et al .",
    "1981 , dravins 1987 , gray 1982 , 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast , classical model atmospheres predict non - shifted and perfectly symmetric lines .",
    "furthermore , we use a state - of - the - art three - dimensional radiative - hydrodynamical model atmosphere to explore the impact of granulation on standard abundance studies of k - dwarfs . in this paper , we present preliminary results from our study .",
    "a small sample of bright k - dwarfs has been observed with the 2dcoud spectrograph ( tull et  al .",
    "1995 ) on the 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the wavelength coverage of these data is complete in the interval @xmath2  and the spectral resolution ( @xmath3 ) ranges from 150,000 to 210,000 .",
    "very high signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath4 ) were achieved by carefully coadding several exposures of the same object .",
    "observations from the hobby - eberly telescope are also being used in this study .",
    "details on the data reduction and post - reduction processing will be given in a forthcoming publication ( ramrez et  al .",
    "similar high quality data for a small sample of stars across the hr diagram will be analyzed in a future study ( ramrez et  al .",
    "2008b ) .    a three - dimensional radiative - hydrodynamical model atmosphere of parameters @xmath5k , @xmath6 , and [ fe / h]=0 was computed using the prescription described in stein & nordlund ( 1998 , see also asplund et al . 2000 ) .",
    "several absorption lines were calculated using the 3d model and have been used to determine theoretical line - bisectors and central wavelength shifts ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "in particular , in fig .",
    "2 we show the relation between central wavelength shift and equivalent width ; we used 10 lines of different wavelength and ep values to construct this trend , which has an intrinsic line - to - line scatter of only 10  ms@xmath1 .",
    "details will be given in ramrez et  al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "by looking at a few iron lines in our observed spectra we find that the theoretical line profiles predicted by the 3d model are reasonably consistent with the observations .",
    "1 shows an example of this .",
    "furthermore , the central wavelength shifts predicted by the 3d model are in remarkable agreement with the observations , as it is shown in fig .  2 for the case of hip  86400 , our sample star with parameters closest to that of the 3d model .",
    "although the scatter is large , the standard deviation of that distribution ( @xmath7130  m  s@xmath1 ) is fully explained by errors in the dispersion solution ( @xmath725  m  s@xmath1 ) , merging of spectral orders and setups ( @xmath750  m  s@xmath1 ) , uncertain laboratory wavelengths ( @xmath875  m  s@xmath1 ) , and finite signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath790  m  s@xmath1 ) .      .",
    "note that the observed bisector ( dotted line ) becomes severely affected by small blends as one approaches the continuum level .",
    "residuals ( observation  model ) , expanded by a factor of 2 , are shown at the bottom.,width=384 ]    using the small set of and lines computed with the 3d model and comparing their strengths with those predicted by a standard spectrum synthesis procedure using a classical 1d kurucz model , we find that the impact of 3d effects on the abundance of fe is very small ( see fig .  3 )",
    "and it is unlikely that 3d effects will solve the problems reported by the studies cited in sect .  1 .        ) and excitation potential ( ep ) .",
    "the equivalent widths predicted by the 3d model were computed with a unique fe abundance ( @xmath9 ) . when used in the 1d analysis ,",
    "the resulting abundance was @xmath10 for lines and @xmath11 for lines .",
    "the fact that the abundances from and lines are consistent ( within 0.01  dex ) and no significant trends with ep or rew are introduced in the 1d analysis suggests that the impact of 3d effects on the fe abundance determination in k - dwarfs is negligible.,width=307 ]      allende prieto , c. , asplund , m. , garca  lpez , r.  j. , & lambert , d.  l. 2002 , , 567 , 544 asplund , m. , nordlund ,  , trampedach , r. , et  al .",
