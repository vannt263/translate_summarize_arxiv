    "the semiclassical treatment of the hawking radiation was introduced by kraus and wilczek in @xcite after which several developments followed .",
    "the main interest of the treatment is to provide a method to compute the back - reaction effect of the radiation on the black hole , or in different words a method which keeps into account the conservation of energy , an effect which is completely ignored in the the external field treatment of the phenomenon @xcite . the main idea is to replace the free field modes of the radiation by the semiclassical wave function of a shell of matter or radiation which consistently propagates in the gravitational field generated by the back hole and by the shell itself .",
    "the shell dynamics was studied in detail in many papers ( see @xcite where also a more complete list of references is found ) . in the original semiclassical treatment @xcite the spectrum of the hawking radiation",
    "is extracted through the standard fourier analysis of the regular modes .",
    "later such a treatment was related to the tunneling picture ; such an approach gave also rise to several proposals and to controversy @xcite and @xcite for a vast list of references .",
    "we think that the mode analysis is still the clearest and safest way to extract the results in the semiclassical approach .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a detailed analysis of the construction of the semiclassical modes and their time fourier transform .",
    "the action related to the modes which are regular on the horizon is defined through mixed boundary condition , i.e. a condition on the value of the conjugate momentum at @xmath2 and a condition at time @xmath3 on the coordinate @xmath4 . while it is easy to prove that the variational problem in which coordinates are given both at time @xmath5 and @xmath3 does not present caustics",
    ", i.e. at most one motion satisfies the variational problem , we prove that for the above mentioned mixed boundary condition problem in general caustics arise i.e. in general more that one trajectory in phase space satisfies the mixed boundary conditions .",
    "qualitatively this phenomenon is due to the fact that the time to reach the final value @xmath6 of the radius is an increasing function the mass of the black hole given an initial value @xmath7 , but such initial value @xmath7 through the condition on the initial momentum is also an increasing function of the mass of the black hole thus giving rise to two counteracting effects .    on the other hand",
    "we prove that if the end point @xmath6 , at which the time fourier analysis will be performed , is less that a critical value , caustics to not occur and we give also a rigorous lower bound on that critical value .",
    "in the original paper @xcite it was argued that the semiclassical approximation is expected to be valid , for not too large values of @xmath6 .",
    "if we stay below the critical value @xmath0 we are in the favorable situation of absence of caustics where the semiclassical wave function is well defined .",
    "it is well know on the other hand that the time fourier analysis gives result independent of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we come now to the computation of the action as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "such a problem corresponds to the solution of a system of two highly non linear equations where the two unknown are the value @xmath8 of the hamiltonian , which even if a constant of motion depends on the time @xmath3 of the boundary condition , and the shell position at time @xmath2 , @xmath7 which also depends on the mixed boundary conditions . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "a discussion was given of a simplified system of equations obtained by keeping only the most singular terms in the exact equations ; even if such a truncation does not remove the high non linearity of the system it simplifies it a lot .",
    "instead here we treat the full exact system of equations . by introducing an implicit time variable",
    "we show that for large times such a system of equations is equivalent to an other non linear equation which can be solved by a convergent iterative procedure .",
    "we show that the first two terms of the convergent iterative procedure are sufficient to provide the leading spectrum of the radiation and its back - reaction correction terms of order @xmath9 .",
    "the treatment is detailed enough to show directly how at late times , higher and higher momenta of the regular modes on the horizon contribute .",
    "from the general viewpoint confining ourselves to large times is not a limitation .",
    "the reason , as well known , is that the hawking radiation is a late - time phenomenon .",
    "this feature was particularly enlightened in the treatment of @xcite where the hawking radiation is extracted by the fourier analysis of the modes on a bounded space - time region fixed in space but translated at asymptotically large times .",
    "in fact the persistence in time is one of the key features of the black hole radiation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sections [ choicegauge ] to [ equationmotion ] are devoted to the gauge choice , to the description of the reduced action for the shell dynamics and the ensuing equations of motion . in section [ caustics ]",
    "we prove the existence of caustics and give a rigorous bound on the value of the critical radius @xmath0 below which no caustic develops .",
    "section [ latetimeexpansion ] is devoted to the non linear system of equations related to the regular modes and to its solution through a convergent iterative procedure .",
    "section [ saddlepoint ] deals with the saddle point calculation of the bogoliubov coefficients and discusses the region of validity for such a procedure . in section [ conclusions ] we give some concluding remarks . in the appendix",
    "we collect the most important formulae relative to the shell dynamics .",
    "as it is usual in this field , we work with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; it means that time , momenta , mass and energy are all measured in units of length .",
    "in the general expression of the metric @xmath12 all quantities @xmath13 are supposed functions only of the radial variable @xmath4 and @xmath3 thus realizing spherical symmetry .",
    "the semiclassical approach is best developed in the painlev - gullstrand metric characterized by setting @xmath14 in ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "such a metric has the advantage of being non singular at the horizon .",
    "after fixing @xmath14 one has still a gauge choice on @xmath15 . in presence of a shell of matter one can not choose @xmath16 .",
    "one has several choices ; for a discussion see @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we will use the `` outer gauge '' which is defined by @xmath16 for @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the shell position . at @xmath19 ,",
    "@xmath15 is continuous as all the other functions appearing in ( [ metric ] ) , but its derivative is discontinuous . for the reader",
    "s convenience we report in the appendix the main results on the shell dynamics which are necessary in the following developments .    the first step is to go over from the standard hilbert - einstein action added to the action of the matter shell , to the action expressed in hamiltonian form .    as usual in gravity it is better to work on a bounded region of space - time",
    ". the radial coordinate will range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 while time ranges from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .    after solving the constraints one can rigorously express the action in reduced form i.e. a form in which only the coordinate @xmath18 of the shell and a conjugate momentum appears , in addition to the boundary terms . as",
    "always these are essential in gravity , where the boundary terms play the role of the hamiltonian .",
    "the reduced action in the outer gauge is given by @xcite ( see also the appendix ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the generating function @xmath26 as a consequence of the constraints",
    "the quantity @xmath27 which appears in ( [ ffunction ] ) is constant in @xmath4 except at the position of the shell where it is subject to a discontinuity . @xmath28 and @xmath8 are the the value of the quantity @xmath27 below and above the shell position and thus at @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "one can consider either @xmath28 or @xmath8 as a given datum of the problem . in the outer gauge for which the action has the form ( [ reducedaction ] ) it is simpler to consider @xmath28 as a datum of the problem which to be consistent with the gravitational equations has to be constant in time @xcite ; so the term proportional to @xmath29 disappears and we reach @xmath30 as in the variation , the components of the metric have to be kept constant at the boundaries , action ( [ reducedaction2 ] ) with the normalization @xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath32 even though the kinetic momentum of the shell @xmath33 ( see appendix ) is a gauge dependent quantity , the conjugate momentum @xmath34 appearing in the reduced action is a gauge invariant quantity @xcite .",
    "it can be computed both for a massive or massless shell @xcite ; as we shall in this paper be interested in the massless case we report below its expression only for the massless case @xmath35 one has to keep in mind that @xmath34 is not the kinetic momentum of the shell but the conjugate momentum with respect to @xmath18 of the whole system .",
    "as in the following of the paper only @xmath18 would appear , we will for notational simplicity denote @xmath18 ( the shell position ) simply by @xmath4 without any possibility of confusion .    at the semiclassical level",
    "the modes which are invariant under the killing vector @xmath36 are simply given by    @xmath37    with @xmath38 the square of the planck length and @xmath39 as is well know such modes have the feature of being singular at the horizon ; this is immediately seen from the expression of @xmath34 eq.([pc ] ) which diverges at @xmath40 .",
    "the vacuum given by @xmath41 , being @xmath42 the destruction operator relative to the described modes gives rise to a singular description at the horizon , while a free falling observer should not experiment any singularity @xcite .",
    "instead the true vacuum should be described in term of modes which are regular at the horizon @xcite .",
    "thus the main object which intervenes in the semiclassical treatment is the semiclassical expression of the modes regular at the horizon i.e. the action of the system which describes an outgoing shell of matter and has the following boundary conditions",
    "@xcite : i ) at time @xmath5 the conjugate momentum is a given value @xmath43 ; ii ) at time @xmath3 the shell position @xmath4 is a given value @xmath6 .",
    "the expression for such an action was already given by kraus and wilczek in @xcite .",
    "with the two conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 the action is @xmath46 t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equality is due to the fact that @xmath8 along the motion is a constant despite @xmath8 depends on the boundary conditions as explicitely written .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the value of @xmath4 at time @xmath5 ; also such a quantity depends on the imposed boundary conditions .",
    "taking into account that @xmath4 and @xmath34 depend both on the final time @xmath3 and on the running time @xmath47 , and denoting with a dot the derivative with respect to @xmath47 one has @xmath48 similarly @xmath49 the action ( [ kwaction ] ) has to be computed on the solution of the equation of motion , satisfying the described boundary conditions .",
    "in the outer gauge @xcite , that we adopt here , the equation of motion for @xmath4 has the form @xmath50 while @xmath51 can be obtained substituting @xmath52 in eq.([pc ] ) .",
    "eq.([dotr ] ) can be integrated in the form @xmath53 the boundary condition at @xmath2 gives @xmath54 where @xmath55 ; eq.([kequation ] ) together with eq.([tequation ] ) should determine completely the motion .",
    "however as we mentioned in the introduction we shall find that for sufficiently large @xmath6 caustics arise , i.e. there exist values of @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath43 for which the boundary conditions are satisfied by more than one motion .",
    "at @xmath2 we have @xmath56 which is regular at the horizon and in virtue of the equations of motion @xmath57 remains regular in the time development .",
    "it is very easy to show that the standard variational problem in which @xmath4 is fixed to @xmath7 at time @xmath5 and to @xmath6 at time @xmath3 presents no caustics .",
    "in fact from @xmath58 we see that @xmath3 is an increasing function of @xmath8 .",
    "thus there is at most one @xmath8 which satisfies the boundary conditions .",
    "but the value of @xmath4 at @xmath3 and @xmath8 determine completely the motion for an outgoing shell .",
    "on the other hand the problem ( [ kwaction ] ) which has mixed boundary conditions is more complicated .",
    "first we note that being , from eq.([kequation ] ) @xmath59 we have that at fixed @xmath43 , @xmath8 is a single valued function of @xmath7 and viceversa @xmath7 a single valued function of @xmath8 .",
    "moreover we have @xmath60 with @xmath61 combined with eq.([dkdh ] ) it gives @xmath62 to investigate the occurrence of caustics we shall compute the derivative of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath7 under the constraint of constant @xmath43 .",
    "first we note that from eq.([timeequation ] ) @xmath63 and @xmath64 thus @xmath65\\ ] ] with @xmath66 it is easily seen that @xmath67 the value of eq.([dtdr0 ] ) for @xmath68 , due to the vanishing of @xmath69 , is the finite negative value @xmath70 with @xmath71 solution of eq.([kequation ] ) in which @xmath7 has been substituted with @xmath6 . on the other hand given a value of @xmath43 and of @xmath7 ( which through eq.([kequation ] ) gives a value of @xmath8 with @xmath72 ) , there will always be @xmath6 large enough as to make the product @xmath73 larger that @xmath74 ; this because @xmath69 diverges when the lower integration limit goes to zero .",
    "thus at that point eq.([dtdr0 ] ) becomes positive while ( [ dtsdr00 ] ) still has to hold .",
    "summarizing we found that for a given @xmath43 , for large enough @xmath6 the derivative ( [ dtdr0 ] ) , when @xmath7 moves from @xmath6 to @xmath75 changes sign , thus vanishing at at least one intermediate point .",
    "this implies the occurrence of caustics @xcite .",
    "in fact the vanishing of the derivative ( [ dtdr0 ] ) at the value @xmath76 implies that there will be points @xmath77 and @xmath78 on the right and on the left of @xmath79 which give rise to the same value of @xmath3 .",
    "thus we shall have pairs of distinct motions with the same @xmath43 which reach @xmath6 at the same time @xmath3 .",
    "( one can also give numerical examples of such pairs of motions ) .",
    "in constructing caustics we took @xmath6 large enough .",
    "we will show now that for @xmath80 where @xmath0 is a critical value , no caustic arises , for any @xmath43 .    below we give a simple procedure to give a rigorous lower bound on @xmath0 .",
    "it is very simple to show that for @xmath81 both @xmath82 and @xmath69 are equal to @xmath74 . setting @xmath83",
    "we will prove that @xmath84 for @xmath6 less than a value @xmath85 independently of the value of @xmath43 .",
    "then being @xmath86 and @xmath87 we have @xmath88 and thus @xmath89 always negative .",
    "thus for @xmath90 there will be no caustic i.e. @xmath85 will constitute a lower bound on @xmath0 . with regard to the proof of ( [ suminequality ] ) explicit computation of the integrals",
    "gives @xmath91 where in writing the two inequalities we used repeatedly @xmath92 .",
    "the last term in eq.([inequality ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath93 and it is less that zero for @xmath94 .",
    "thus we do not have caustics for @xmath95 and as a consequence we have rigorously @xmath96 for the critical value @xmath0 . a numerical search of eq.([dtdr0 ] )",
    "gives the wider bound @xmath97 . in @xcite the approximate system of equation obtained by retaining in eqs.([tequation],[kequation ] ) only the singular terms i.e. only the logarithms was considered .",
    "also for this approximate system of equations , caustics occur for @xmath6 sufficiently large .",
    "the occurrence of caustics for @xmath98 hints at a failure of the semiclassical approximation when we move too far from the horizon as the modes would show a discontinuity in @xmath6 at the point where more than one trajectory in phase space start contributing . on the other hand",
    "we will show in section [ latetimeexpansion ] , that for any given pair @xmath99 even for @xmath98 for @xmath3 sufficiently large no caustic occurs .    in @xcite",
    "it was proposed to perform the time fourier analysis at a point @xmath6 not too far from the horizon , the reason being that there one should expect the semiclassical approximation to be reliable .",
    "we showed above that for @xmath80 there are no ambiguities in the definition of the action and in addition it is well known the time fourier transform gives results independent of @xmath6 ; thus we shall work with @xmath80 .",
    "in this section we shall give the solution of the equations for @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the form of a series convergent for large times .",
    "large times are also the relevant times for the treatment of the hawking radiation .",
    "we recall that @xmath55 . then from eq.([tequation ] ) for @xmath6 fixed , @xmath102 implies @xmath103 looking now at eq.([kequation ] ) we must have in the same limit @xmath104 and as @xmath72 we have also @xmath105 .",
    "we introduce now the implicit time variable @xmath106 which due to the bounds on @xmath8 , for @xmath107 tends to @xmath5 .",
    "eq.([tequation ] ) becomes @xmath108 it will be useful for the following developments to use the notation @xmath109 and set @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 functions of @xmath113 do be determined .",
    "eq.([tequation ] ) becomes @xmath114 with @xmath115\\ ] ] and eq.([kequation ] ) becomes @xmath116 with @xmath117 we want to express @xmath118 as a function of the implicit variable @xmath113 .",
    "first we note that for @xmath119 the system of the two equations @xmath120 has the unique solution @xmath121 where @xmath122 and that @xmath123 and @xmath124 in a polydisk around @xmath119 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 are analytic functions of @xmath127 .",
    "we have @xmath128 and thus according to the implicit function theorem @xcite , in a neighborhood of @xmath129 , @xmath112 will be an analytic function of @xmath113 and @xmath111 . substituting in @xmath123 we obtain the equation @xmath130 at @xmath119 , @xmath125 we have @xmath131 and",
    "thus @xmath111 will be an analytic function @xmath132 of @xmath113 in a neighborhood of @xmath119 .",
    "recalling now the definition of @xmath111 we have @xmath133 summing up we found that in a neighborhood of @xmath119 from the equations @xmath120 eq.([implicit ] ) follows .",
    "eq.([implicit ] ) due to the definition of @xmath134 is still an implicit equation .",
    "we show now that eq.([implicit ] ) can be solved by a convergent iterative procedure .",
    "being @xmath132 analytic with @xmath135 , @xmath136 will be in a neighborhood of @xmath137 a non negative function of @xmath113 of lipschitz type , i.e. @xmath138 for @xmath139 belonging to such a neighborhood .",
    "moreover @xmath140 .",
    "for @xmath3 such that @xmath141 the r.h.s . of eq.([implicit ] ) maps the domain @xmath142 into itself .",
    "we start the iterative process with @xmath143 . we must give a bound on @xmath144 .",
    "we have for @xmath145 latexmath:[\\[|h_{n+1}-h_{n}|\\leq c e^{-\\frac{t}{2h^2_n}}(1 -e^{-\\frac{t}{2 } ( \\frac{1}{h^2_{n-1}}-\\frac{1}{h^2_n})})\\leq c e^{-\\frac{t}{2h^2_n } } ~t~\\frac { h_n - h_{n-1}}{h_n h^2_{n-1}}\\leq \\frac{c}{m } \\frac{t}{m^2 } e^{-\\frac{t}{2r_1 } }    result .",
    "thus for @xmath3 satisfying eq.([injection ] ) and @xmath147 we have a contraction mapping and according to banach fixed point theorem @xcite eq.([implicit ] ) has one and only one solution given by the convergent sequence @xmath148 .",
    "we give in fig.1 a qualitative graph of the behavior in time of @xmath149 and @xmath101 .     and",
    "@xmath101 ]    we work out now explicitely the first two terms of such an iteration procedure ; they will be sufficient to give the @xmath1 corrections to the hawking distribution . with @xmath143 and @xmath151",
    "we have @xmath152 and thus for @xmath100 @xmath153 due to eq.([dsodt ] ) the time dependence of the mode which is regular at the horizon , for fixed @xmath6 is @xmath154 with @xmath155 i.e. for the semiclassical mode we have @xmath156/l_p^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is the square of the planck length .",
    "thus @xmath57 at large times behaves as @xmath158 independently of @xmath43 . on the other hand",
    "the fourier time analysis of @xmath159 contains frequencies which are above and below the value @xmath28 and this is the well known fact that the mode of the system which is regular at the horizon does not represent an eigenvalue of the energy as measured by a stationary observer at space infinity .",
    "the deviations from the value @xmath28 represent the positive and negative frequency content of the radiation mode .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the action which appears in ( [ actionexp ] ) refers to the whole system , which includes both the shell and the core . if we want to analyze the modes of the radiation we have to subtract from the exponent the background term @xmath158",
    "as well known and discussed in @xcite the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath160 and @xmath161 are given by @xmath162 as discussed in section [ caustics ] we will work with @xmath80 .",
    "the above integrals will be computed using the saddle point method where @xmath163 plays the role of asymptotic parameter @xcite . from what we derived in the previous section , the exponent appearing in the integrands , multiplied by @xmath164 apart from @xmath165 which is constant in time and common to both coefficients , are respectively @xmath166 where we used the notation of eq.([notation ] ) , for the @xmath160 case ( i.e. upper sign ) the saddle point is given by the value of time @xmath3 which satisfies @xmath167 which being @xmath168 has solution for real @xmath3 and thus at a real value of the exponent in eq.([alphabeta ] ) .",
    "on the contrary for the @xmath161 case ( lower sign ) , the saddle point equation @xmath169 has solution for complex @xmath3 .",
    "at such a value of time the exponent ( [ reducedexponent ] ) ( lower sign ) equals @xmath170 the solution of eq.([betasaddlepoint ] ) to second order in @xmath171 , which is the order we are interested in , is given by @xmath172 from eq.([betaexponent ] ) we see that to find the imaginary part of such exponent to order @xmath173 we simply need the imaginary part of @xmath3 to first order in @xmath171 . using ( [ tau1solution ] ) we have @xmath174 substituting into eq.([betaexponent ] ) we find @xmath175 which according to ( [ alphabeta ] ) has to be divided by @xmath163 .",
    "thus we have @xmath176 which is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "we see from eq.([h(t ) ] ) that for @xmath177 , @xmath100 tends to @xmath28 and thus the time fourier transform of the exponential of the action ( [ actionexp ] ) which refers to the whole system has a singularity at the frequency @xmath28 . recalling that @xmath8 ( outer mass ) represents the energy of the whole system",
    ", we identify the parameter @xmath28 with the mass of the black - hole before the decay .",
    "using the property of the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath178 one reaches for the flux of the hawking radiation @xcite @xmath179 this completes the explicit derivation of the @xmath173 correction to the hawking formula from the time fourier transform of the semiclassical modes .",
    "an alternative way to derive ( [ beta2oalpha2 ] ) was given by keski - vakkuri and kraus @xcite where it is proven that for the @xmath161 coefficient the imaginary part of the action at the saddle point ( [ betasaddlepoint ] ) is given by @xmath180 which is equivalent to eq.([imb ] ) .",
    "the importance of equation ( [ kvkrelation ] ) is to show directly how the `` tunneling '' is due only to the imaginary part of the `` space part '' of the action .    with regard to the validity of the expansion we see from the saddle point value ( [ alphasaddlepoint],[betasaddlepoint ] ) @xmath181 that the series if effectively an expansion in @xmath9 and thus expected to hold for @xmath182 . from eq.([explicit ] ) we see that for a given @xmath171 , large values of the wave number @xmath43 contribute at times @xmath3 which grow like @xmath183 .",
    "the typical @xmath171 for the radiation emitted by a black hole of mass @xmath28 is according to eq.([beta2oalpha2 ] ) ( wien s law ) @xmath184 and thus the approximation expected to be reliable at the typical frequency ( [ typicalfreq ] ) or below for @xmath185 i.e. for black holes of mass of a few planck masses or of higher mass .",
    "in this paper we gave a detailed treatment of the late - time expansion which occurs in the semiclassical approach to the hawking radiation .",
    "we find that the variational problem defining the action related to the modes which are regular at the horizon allows in general more than one solution , due to the presence of caustics .",
    "we prove however that for radii below a critical value @xmath0 the variational problem has only one solution and we give a rigorous lower bound on @xmath0 .",
    "thus for @xmath6 less that @xmath0 where the semiclassical approximation is expected to be accurate there are non ambiguities in computing the action and the time fourier transform can be applied to extract the bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "the hamiltonian depends on the boundary condition through a system of two highly non linear equations .",

    "we work out explicitely the first two steps of such iteration which are sufficient to compute the @xmath9 correction to the hawking spectrum .",
