    "the x - ray background ( xrb ) was discovered before the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , but only now is its origin being fully understood .",
    "the hard ( @xmath9 ) xrb has been nearly completely resolved into individual sources ; most of these are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , but there is a minor contribution from the hot , intergalactic medium in rich clusters of galaxies ( rosati et al . 2002 ; cowie et al . 2002 ; & mushotzky et al .",
    "in addition , the spectra of these faint x - ray sources are consistent with that of the `` diffuse '' xrb .",
    "if current models of the luminosity functions and evolution of these sources are reasonably correct , then the xrb arises from sources in the redshift range @xmath10 , making them an important probe of density fluctuations intermediate between relatively nearby galaxy surveys ( @xmath11 ) and the cmb ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "while there have been several attempts to measure large scale , correlated fluctuations in the hard xrb , these have only yielded upper limits or , at best , marginal detections ( e.g. barcons et al .",
    "2000 , treyer et al . 1998 and",
    "references cited therein ) . on small scales ,",
    "a recent correlation analysis of 159 sources in the chandra deep field south survey detected significant correlations for separations out to @xmath13 ( giacconi et al .",
    "( at the survey flux level , these sources comprise roughly two thirds of the hard xrb . ) on much larger scales , a recent analysis by scharf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claims a significant detection of large - scale harmonic structure in the xrb with spherical harmonic order @xmath14 corresponding to structures on angular scales of @xmath15 the auto - correlation results we describe here complement this analysis , indicating clustering on angular scales of @xmath16 to @xmath17 , corresponding to harmonic order of @xmath18 .",
    "however , all three detections have relatively low signal to noise and require independent confirmation .",
    "the dipole moment of the xrb has received particular attention , primarily because of its relation to the dipole in the cmb , which is likely due to the earth s motion with respect to the rest frame of the cmb .",
    "if this is the case , one expects a similar dipole in the xrb with an amplitude that is 3.4 times larger because of the difference in spectral indices of the two backgrounds ( boldt 1987 ) . in the x - ray literature , this dipole is widely known as the compton - getting effect ( compton & getting 1935 ) .",
    "in addition , it is quite likely that the xrb has an intrinsic dipole due to the asymmetric distribution in the local matter density that is responsible for the earth s peculiar motion in the first place .",
    "searches for both these dipoles have concentrated on the hard xrb , since at lower energies the x - ray sky is dominated by galactic structure .",
    "there have been several tentative detections of the x - ray dipole ( e.g. scharf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) , but these have large uncertainties",
    ". a firm detection of an intrinsic dipole or even an upper limit on its presence would provide an important constraint on the inhomogeneity of the local distribution of matter via a less often used tracer of mass and a concomitant constraint on cosmological models ( e.g. , lahav , piran & treyer 1997 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2 we describe the hard x - ray map used in the analysis , the determination of its effective beam size , and cuts made to remove the foreground contaminants . in section",
    " 3 , we describe the remaining large scale structures in the map and the determination of their amplitudes .",
    "the dipole is of particular interest , and is the topic of section  4 .",
    "the correlation function of the residual map and its implications for intrinsic correlations are discussed in section  5 . in section",
    " 6 , we compare our results to previous observations and discuss the cosmological implications of these results in  7 .",
    "there has been much recent progress in understanding the x - ray background through instruments such as rosat , chandra and xmm . however , these either have too low an energy threshold or have too small a field of view to study the large scale structure of the hard x - rays .",
    "the best observations relevant to large scale structure are still those from the heao1 a2 experiment that measured the surface brightness of the x - ray background in the @xmath20 band ( boldt 1987 ) .",
    "the heao1 data set we consider was constructed from the output of two medium energy detectors ( med ) with different fields of view ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and two high energy detectors ( hed3 ) with these same fields of view .",
    "these data were collected during the six month period beginning on day 322 of 1977 .",
    "counts from the four detectors were combined and binned in 24,576 @xmath23 pixels .",
    "the pixelization we use is an equatorial quadrilateralized spherical cube projection on the sky , the same as used for the cobe satellite cmb maps ( white and stemwedel 1992 ) .",
    "the combined map has a spectral bandpass ( quantum efficiency @xmath24 ) of approximately @xmath25 ( jahoda & mushotzky 1989 ) and is shown in galactic coordinates in figure [ fig : heao ] .",
    "for consistency with other work , all signals are converted to equivalent flux in the @xmath26 band .",
    "because of the ecliptic longitude scan pattern of the heao satellite , sky coverage and therefore photon shot noise are not uniform .",
    "however , the variance of the cleaned , corrected map , @xmath27 , is much larger than the variance of photon shot noise , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( allen , jahoda & whitlock 1994 ) .",
    "this implies that most of the variance in the x - ray map is due to `` real '' structure .",
    "for this reason and to reduce contamination from any systematics that might be correlated with the scan pattern , we chose to weight the pixels equally in this analysis .      to determine the level of intrinsic correlations , we must account for the effects of beam smearing and so it is essential to characterize the point spread function ( psf ) of the above map .",
    "the psf varies somewhat with position on the sky because of the pixelization and the asymmetric beam combined with the heao1 scan pattern .",
    "we obtained a mean psf by averaging the individual psfs of 60 strong heao1 point sources ( piccinotti 1982 ) that were located more than @xmath30 from the galactic plane .",
    "the latter condition was imposed to avoid crowding and to approximate the windowing of the subsequent analysis ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the composite psf , shown in figure [ fig : psf ] , is well fit by a gaussian with a full width , half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath31 .",
    "as a check of this psf , we generated monte carlo maps of sources observed with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( fwhm ) triangular beams appropriate for the a2 detectors ( shafer 1983 ) and then combined the maps with quadcubed pixelization as above .",
    "the resulting average psf from these trials is also well fit by a gaussian with a fwhm of @xmath32 , i.e. , about @xmath33 less than that in the figure [ fig : psf ] .",
    "considering that the widths of the triangular beams given above are nominal , that the triangular beam pattern is only approximate ( especially at higher energies ) , and that we did not take into account the slight smearing in the satellite scan direction ( shafer 1983 ) , the agreement is remarkably good . in the following analysis , we use the @xmath31 fit derived from the observed map ; however , changing the psf fwhm by a few percent does not significantly affect the results of this paper .      to remove the effects of the galaxy and strong extra - galactic point sources ,",
    "some regions of the map were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the dominant feature in the heao map is the galaxy ( see figure [ fig : heao ] ) so all data within @xmath34 of the galactic plane or within @xmath35 of the galactic center were cut from the map .",
    "in addition , large regions ( @xmath36 ) centered on @xmath37 discrete x - ray sources with @xmath38 fluxes larger than @xmath39 ( piccinotti 1982 ) were removed from the maps . around the sixteen brightest of these sources ( with fluxes larger than @xmath40 )",
    "the cut regions were enlarged to @xmath41 . further enlarging the area of the excised regions had a negligible effect on the following analysis so we conclude that the sources have been effectively removed . the resulting `` cleaned '' map ( designated map a ) has a sky coverage of @xmath42 and is our baseline map for further cuts .    to test the possibility of further point source contamination",
    ", we also used the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) bright source catalog ( voges et al .",
    "1996 ) to identify relatively bright sources .",
    "while the rass survey has somewhat less than full sky coverage ( @xmath43 ) , it has a relatively low flux limit that corresponds to a @xmath26 flux of @xmath44 for a photon spectral index of @xmath45 .",
    "every source in the rass catalog was assigned a @xmath26 flux from its b - band flux by assuming a spectral index of @xmath46 as deduced from its hr2 hardness ratio .",
    "for fainter sources , the computed value of @xmath47 is quite uncertain ; if it fell outside the typical range of most x - ray sources , @xmath46 , then @xmath47 was simply forced to be @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear that extrapolating rass flux to the @xmath26 band is not accurate , so one must consider the level to which sources are masked with due caution .",
    "however , we are only using these fluxes to mask bright sources and so this procedure is unlikely to bias the results .",
    "we considered maps where the rosat sources were removed at three different inferred @xmath26 flux thresholds .",
    "first , we identified sources with fluxes exceeding the piccinotti level , @xmath39 .",
    "thirty - four additional , high galactic latitude rass sources were removed , resulting in a map with sky coverage of @xmath50 ( designated map b ) . in order to compare more directly with the results of scharf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( see  6 ) we removed sources at their flux level , @xmath51 . the map masked in this way has @xmath52 sky coverage ( compared to the @xmath53 coverage of the scharf et al .",
    "analysis ) and is designated map c. finally , to check how sensitive our dipole results are to the particular masking of the map , we lowered the flux cut level to @xmath54 , which reduced the sky coverage to @xmath55 .",
    "the map resulting from this cut is designated map d in table 3 .    as an alternative to using the rass sources ,",
    "the map itself was searched for `` sources '' that exceeded the nearby background by a specified amount .",
    "since the quad - cubed format lays out the pixels on an approximately square array , we averaged each pixel with its eight neighbors and then compared this value with the median value of the next nearest sixteen pixels ( ignoring pixels within the masked regions ) . if the average flux associated with a given pixel exceeded the median flux of the background by a prescribed threshold , then all 25 pixels ( @xmath36 ) were removed from further consideration . for a threshold corresponding to 2.2 times the mean shot noise in the map",
    "approximately 120 more `` sources '' were identified and masked resulting in a sky coverage of @xmath56 .",
    "this map is labeled map e in table 3 . finally , we used an even more aggressive cut corresponding to 1.75 times the mean shot noise which resulted in a masked map with @xmath57 sky coverage .",
    "this map is labeled map f.",
    "there are several local sources of large - scale structure in the heao map which can not be eliminated by masking isolated regions .",
    "these include diffuse emission from the galaxy , emission ( diffuse and/or faint point sources ) from the local supercluster , the compton - getting dipole , and a linear time drift in detector sensitivity .",
    "since none of these are known _ a priori _ , we fit an eight parameter model to the data .",
    "of course , the compton - getting dipole is known in principle if one assumes the kinetic origin of the dipole in the cosmic microwave background ; however , there may also be an intrinsic x - ray dipole that is not accounted for .",
    "( see  4 below . )",
    "only one correction was made _ a priori _ to the map and that was for the dipole due to the earth s motion around the sun ; however , this correction has a negligible effect on the results .",
    "a more detailed account of the model is given in boughn ( 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray background has a diffuse ( or unresolved ) galactic component which varies strongly with galactic latitude ( iwan et al .",
    "this emission is still significant at high galactic latitude ( @xmath58 ) and extrapolates to @xmath59 at the galactic poles .",
    "we modeled this emission in two ways .",
    "the first model consisted of a linear combination of a secant law galaxy with the haslam @xmath60 full sky map ( haslam et al .",
    "the latter was included to take into account x - rays generated by inverse compton scattering of cmb photons from high energy electrons in the galactic halo , the source of much of the synchrotron emission in the haslam map . as an alternative galaxy model we also considered the two disk , exponentially truncated model of iwan et al .",
    "our results are independent of which model is used .",
    "in addition to the galactic component , evidence has been found for faint x - ray emission from plane of the local supercluster ( jahoda 1993 , boughn 1999 ) .",
    "because of its faintness , very detailed models of this emission are not particularly useful .",
    "the model we use here is a simple `` pillbox '' , i.e uniform x - ray emissivity within a circular disk of thickness equal to a @xmath61 of the radius and with its center located @xmath62 of a radius from us in the direction of the virgo cluster ( see boughn 1999 for details ) .",
    "the amplitude of this emission , while significant , is largely independent of the details of the model and , in any case , has only a small effect on the results .",
    "time drifts in the detector sensitivity can also lead to apparent structure in the reconstructed x - ray map .",
    "at least one of the a-2 detectors changed sensitivity by @xmath59 in the six month interval of the current data set ( jahoda 1993 ) . because of the ecliptic scan pattern of the heao satellite , this results in a large - scale pattern in the sky which varies with ecliptic longitude with a period of @xmath63 . if the drift is assumed to be linear , the form of the resulting large - scale structure in the map is completely determined .",
    "a linear drift of unknown amplitude is taken into account by constructing a sky map with the appropriate structure and then fitting for the amplitude simultaneously with the other parameters .",
    "we investigated the possibility of non - linear drift by considering quadratic and cubic terms as well ; however , this did not significantly reduce the @xmath64 of the fit nor change the subsequent results .",
    "the eight parameters that characterize the amplitude of these structures are used to model the large - scale structure in the heao map .",
    "let the x - ray intensity map be denoted by the vector @xmath65 , where the element @xmath66 is the intensity in the @xmath67 pixel .",
    "the observed intensity is modelled as the sum of eight templates with amplitudes described by the eight dimensional vector @xmath68 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an @xmath71 matrix whose elements are the values of each template function at each pixel of the map . as discussed above ,",
    "these template functions include : a uniform map to represent the monopole of the x - ray background ; the three components of a dipole ( in equatorial coordinates ) ; the large - scale pattern resulting from a linear instrumental gain drift ; a galactic secant law ; the haslam @xmath60 map ; and the amplitude of the `` pillbox '' model of the local supercluster .",
    "the noise vector @xmath72 is assumed to be gaussian distributed with correlations described by @xmath73 .    as discussed above (  2 ) , we chose to weight each pixel equally since the shot noise is considerably less than the `` real '' fluctuations in the sky .",
    "for the purposes of fitting the map to the above model we consider both photon shot noise and fluctuations in the xrb ( see figure [ fig : acf ] ) to be `` noise '' .",
    "this noise is correlated and a minimum @xmath64 fit must take such correlations into account . however ,",
    "for simplicity , we ignore these correlations when finding the best fit model amplitudes and perform a standard least squares fit by minimizing @xmath74 on the cleaned heao map . from the standard equations of linear regression the values of the parameters that minimize this sum are @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a symmetric eight by eight matrix",
    ". this would be the maximum likelihood estimator if the correlation matrix were uniform and diagonal .",
    "though this fit ignores correlations in the errors , it is unbiased and is likely to be very close to the minimum @xmath64 ( maximum likelihood ) fit , since the noise correlations are on a much smaller scale than the features we are attempting to fit .",
    "the correlated nature of the noise can not be ignored when computing the uncertainties in the fit since there are far fewer noise independent data points than there are pixels in the map .",
    "it is straightforward to show that errors in the estimated parameters @xmath77 are given by @xmath78 this error is likely to be only slightly larger than would be the case for the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "@xmath79 is a combination of the uncorrelated shot noise and the correlated fluctuations indicated in figure [ fig : acf ] .",
    "we assume it to be homogeneous and isotropic , i.e. , that @xmath80 depends only on the angular separation of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 pixels .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]      the dipole amplitude and directions are from the 8-parameter fits in @xmath83 units and galactic coordinates .",
    "map c is for the map of table [ tab : comp ] ; map d is masked at a source level of @xmath84 ; map e is masked with internal source identification ; and map f is masked with a lower level of internal source identification ( see  2 for full details ) .",
    "also listed are the amplitude and direction of the compton - getting dipole ( g - p ) as inferred from the cmb dipole .",
    "the constrained amplitudes are for dipole models fixed to the direction of the cmb dipole .",
    "even though we find no evidence for an intrinsic dipole in the xrb , it would be useful to place an upper limit on its amplitude .",
    "we define the dimensionless dipole by writing the first two moments of the x - ray intensity as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a vector in the direction of the dipole .",
    "there are various approaches one could take to find an upper limit , and the problem is complicated somewhat because the error bars are anisotropic ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the dipole in the @xmath87 direction is less constrained than in the other directions because of the anisotropic masking of the map . here",
    "we take the limits on the individual components of the intrinsic dipole and marginalize over the dipole direction to obtain a distribution for its amplitude . for this",
    ", we use a bayesian formalism and assume a uniform prior on the amplitude , @xmath88 .",
    "we find @xmath89 at the 95 % c.l .",
    "if the direction of the dipole is fixed to be that of the cmb dipole then the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits on the dipole amplitudes fall in the range @xmath90 to @xmath91 for the fits listed in table [ tab : dipole ] .    the same sort of problem arises when trying to attach an error bar to the amplitude of the dipole fits to the maps which include the compton - getting dipole .",
    "it seems clear from table [ tab : comp ] that we find evidence for a dipole at the 2 @xmath92 level .",
    "this is supported by the six parameter fits of table [ tab : dipole ] , where the various maps indicate positive detections at a 2 to 3 @xmath92 level .",
    "however , in the eight parameter fits , the dipole amplitude is a non - linear combination of the fit components .",
    "there are two approaches we can take in converting the three dimensional limits to a limit on the dipole amplitude .",
    "we can either fix the direction in the direction of the cmb dipole , which results in the constrained limits shown in table [ tab : dipole ] .",
    "alternatively , we can marginalize over the possible directions of the dipole , which will necessarily result in weaker limits than when the direction is fixed .",
    "this is particularly true here , where the direction of greatest uncertainty in the dipole measurement is roughly orthogonal to the expected dipole direction . in the case of the compton - getting dipole ,",
    "there is a strong prior that it should be in the cmb dipole direction , so our limit is stronger than it would be if we did not have information about the cmb .",
    "in addition to the upper limit on the intrinsic dipole amplitude , we can also constrain the underlying dipole variance , which can , in turn , be used to test theoretically predicted power spectra .",
    "while the observed amplitude is related to the dipole variance , @xmath93 , there is large uncertainty due to cosmic variance .",
    "the dipole represents only three independent samplings of @xmath94 . to constrain @xmath94 ,",
    "we again take a bayesian approach and calculate the likelihood of observing the data given the noise and @xmath94 , @xmath95 where the product is over the three spatial directions and we have ignored the small off - diagonal noise correlations ( see table [ tab : corrm ] ) . with a uniform prior on @xmath94 , its posterior distribution implies a 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit of @xmath96 .",
    "this is twice as high as would be inferred from the limit on the dipole because of the significant tail in the distribution due to cosmic variance .",
    "the limit implied by the dipole ( of map c ) , @xmath97 is at the 80% c.l .",
    "the difference between the limits arises because occasionally a small dipole can occur even when the variance is large .",
    "the bottom line is that we have detected the dipole in the xrb at about the 2 @xmath92 level and that it is consistent with the compton - getting dipole .",
    "there is no evidence for any other intrinsic dipole at this same level .",
    "we will discuss the apparent detection of an intrinsic dipole by scharf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in  6 .",
    "a standard way to detect the clustering of sources ( or of the emission of these sources ) is to compute the auto - correlation function ( acf ) , defined by @xmath98 where the sum is over all pairs of pixels , @xmath99 , separated by an angle @xmath2 , @xmath66 is the intensity of the @xmath100 pixel , @xmath101 is the mean intensity , and @xmath102 is the number of pairs of pixels separated by @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig : acf ] shows the acf of the residual map after being corrected with the 8-parameter fit and for photon shot noise in the @xmath103 bin .",
    "the error bars are highly correlated and were determined from monte carlo trials in which the pixel intensity distribution was assumed to be gaussian with the same acf as in the figure .",
    "there is essentially no significant structure for @xmath104 once local structures have been removed , as is evident in figures [ fig : acf ] , [ fig : resid ] , and [ fig : intrin ] .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : acf ] that the residuals of map a possess significant correlated structure .",
    "it must be determined how much , if any , is due to clustering in the xrb and how much is simply due to smearing by the psf of the map .",
    "it is straightforward to show that an uncorrelated signal smeared by a gaussian psf , @xmath105 , results in an acf of the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the gaussian width of the psf in figure [ fig : psf ] ( @xmath108 ) the dashed curve in figure [ fig : acf ] is essentially this functional form , modified slightly to take into account the pixelization . in the plot ,",
    "its amplitude has been forced to agree with @xmath103 data point , while a maximum likelihood fit results in an amplitude about 5% lower ( a consequence of the correlated noise ) . for @xmath109",
    ", the acf of the data clearly exceeds that accountable by beam smearing and this excess is even more pronounced with the maximum likelihood fit .",
    "the reduced @xmath64 for the fit to the first eight data points ( @xmath110 ) is @xmath111 for six degrees of freedom which is another measure of the excess structure between 3 and 9 degrees .",
    "note , this is a two parameter fit since the photon shot noise ( which occurs only at @xmath103 ) is also one of the parameters .",
    "while it is apparent that there is some intrinsic correlation in the x - ray background , it can not be estimated by the residual to the above two parameter fit since that overestimates the contribution of beam smearing in order to minimize @xmath64 .",
    "instead , we also include in the fit a form for the intrinsic correlation and find its amplitude as well .",
    "since the signal to noise is too small to allow a detailed model of the intrinsic clustering , we chose to model it with a simple power - law @xmath112 .",
    "this form provides an acceptable fit to the acf of both radio and x - ray surveys on somewhat smaller angular scales ( cress & kamionkowski 1998 , soltan et al .",
    "1996 , giacconi et al .",
    "this intrinsic correlation was then convolved with the psf and applied to the quadcube pixelization of the map ( e.g. , boughn 1998 ) .",
    "finally , it is important to take into account the effects of the 8-parameter fit used to remove the large - scale structure as discussed in  3 .",
    "if the x - ray background has intrinsic structure on the scale of many degrees , the 8-parameter fit will tend to remove it in order to minimize @xmath64 .",
    "since the model is composed of relatively large scale features , the greatest effect is expected for the largest angles .",
    "the significance of this effect was determined by generating monte carlo trials assuming a gaussian pixel intensity distribution with the same acf as in figure [ fig : acf ] .",
    "the 8-parameter model was then fit and each trial map was corrected accordingly .",
    "the acfs computed for these corrected maps indicate that , as expected , the value of the acf is significantly attenuated for larger angles .",
    "the attenuation factor for @xmath113 is already 0.55 and decreases rapidly for larger angles .",
    "the errors indicated in figure [ fig : acf ] were also determined from these monte carlo trials and , as mentioned above , are highly correlated .",
    "we model the auto - correlation function as a sum of three templates and fit for their best amplitude .",
    "much of the analysis parallels the discussion for the fits of large scale structure in the map , with the exception that here the number of bins is small enough that it is simple to calculate the maximum likelihood fit .",
    "again , we model the observed correlation function vector as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a @xmath116 matrix containing the templates for shot noise ( @xmath117 ) , beam smearing ( @xmath118 ) , and intrinsic correlations in the xrb ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the amplitudes are given by the three element vector @xmath120 and the noise is described by the correlation matrix determined from monte carlo trials , @xmath121 .",
    "shot noise contributes only to the first bin ( zero separation ) of the acf and has amplitude given by its variance , @xmath117 .",
    "beam smearing contributes to the acf with a template that looks like the beam convolved with itself , so appears as a gaussian with a fwhm a factor of @xmath122 larger than that of the beam and has amplitude denoted as @xmath123 .",
    "finally , the intrinsic correlations are modelled as @xmath124 , which is then smoothed appropriately by the beam .",
    "its amplitude is denoted by its inferred correlation at zero separation , @xmath125 we fit using a range of indices , @xmath126 , which cover the range of theoretical models of the intrinsic correlation .",
    "both the psf template and the intrinsic template are modified to include the effects of the attenuation at large angles as discussed above .    minimizing @xmath64 with respect to the three fit parameters , @xmath120 , results in the maximum likelihood fit to the model if one assumes gaussian statistics .",
    "this assumption is reasonable by virtue of the central limit theorem since each data point consists of the combination of the signals from a great many pixels , each of which is approximately gaussian distributed . in the presence of correlated noise , @xmath64 is defined by @xmath127 it is straightforward to show that the value of the parameters that minimize @xmath64 are given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 because of the large attenuation of the acf at large angles , we chose to fit to only those data points with @xmath130 , i.e. , @xmath131 , even though there appears to be statistically significant structure out to @xmath132 .",
    "the results of the fit of the @xmath133 model to the acf of the residuals of map a are listed in table [ tab : acf ] and plotted in figure [ fig : acf ] .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the correlation matrix of the fit parameters is given by , @xmath134 so the errors given in table [ tab : acf ] are given by @xmath135 and the normalized correlation coefficients by @xmath136 .",
    "the correlations are as expected , i.e. , @xmath119 and @xmath123 are highly correlated , while @xmath117 is relatively uncorrelated with the other two parameters .    from the results in table [ tab : acf ]",
    "it appears that intrinsic correlations in the x - ray background are detected at the 4 @xmath92 level for sources with flux levels below @xmath39 .",
    "of course , if we have not successfully eliminated sources with fluxes larger than this , then the clustering amplitude might well be artificially inflated .",
    "it was for this reason that we used the rass catalog to identify and remove additional sources with intensities @xmath137 , the result of which was map b ( see  2 ) .",
    "the fits to map b are also listed in table [ tab : acf ] .",
    "the clustering amplitude , @xmath119 , of the fits to this modified map were only @xmath138 less than that of map a , i.e. , considerably less than 1 @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath64s of both fits are acceptable .",

    "it is likely that current models of the luminosity function will have to be substantially modified as further deep observations of the sources of the xrb are made .",
    "however , as pointed out above , the isw is relatively insensitive to the exact shape of the redshift distribution of luminosity .",

    "its clear that firming up the value of @xmath268 and determining how it varies with scale and redshift will be required before the isw effect can be unambiguously interpreted .",
    "the above limit may be compared to what we found from cross correlating cobe with the nvss radio galaxy survey ( boughn & crittenden 2002 ) .",

    "radio galaxies and the x - ray background are , indeed , correlated with each other ( boughn 1998 ) .",
    "an important source of noise in the cross correlation of figure 7 is instrument noise of the cobe dmr receivers .",
    "in addition , the relatively poor angular resolution of the cobe radiometers reduce , somewhat , the amplitude of the isw signal .",
    "therefore , some improvement can be expected by repeating the analysis on future cmb maps , such as that soon to be produced by nasa s map satellite mission .",
    "if such an analysis still finds the absence of an isw effect , then the current @xmath3 model would be in serious conflict with observational data if the x - ray bias can be similarly constrained .",
    "on the other hand , a positive detection would provide important evidence about the dynamics of the universe even if the x - ray bias remains uncertain .",
    "by carefully reconstructing the heao beam and analysing its auto - correlation function , we have been able to confirm the presence of intrinsic clustering in the x - ray background .",
    "this gives independent verification of the multipole analysis of scharf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the level of clustering we see is comparable .",
    "the clustering we see is in excess of that predicted by standard cold dark matter models and indicates that some biasing is needed .",
    "the amount of biasing required depends on the cosmological model and on how the bias evolves over time ; if the bias is constant , typical models indicate that @xmath270 the biases of galaxies , clusters of galaxies , radio sources , and quasars have yet to be adequately characterized and so whether or not the above x - ray bias is excessive is a question that , for the present , remains unanswered .",
    "we have also confirmed , at the 2 - 3 @xmath92 level , the detection of the compton - getting dipole in the x - ray background due to the earth s motion with respect to the rest frame of the cmb .",
    "however , we have been unable to confirm the presence of an intrinsic dipole in the xrb and have actually been able to exclude a significant part of the range reported by scharf et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "while our dipole limit is still too small to conflict with any of the favored cdm models , combining our dipole limit with observations of the local bulk flow enable us to constrain @xmath271 . for constant bias models",
    ", this suggests a relatively large matter density , as is also seen in for other velocity studies ; however , the uncertainty in this limit is still considerable .    with the observed x - ray clustering ,",
    "large @xmath272 models predict a detectable correlation with the cosmic microwave background arising via the integrated sachs - wolfe effect . that we have not observed this effect suggests @xmath273 .",
    "this is beginning to conflict with models preferred by a combination of cmb , lss and snia data ( e.g. , de bernardis et al . 2000 & bahcall et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this work gives strong motivation for further observations of the large scale structure of the hard x - ray background .",
    "better measurements of the full sky xrb anisotropy are needed , as is more information about the redshift distribution of the x - ray sources . this will be essential for cross correlation with the new cmb data from the map satellite and to bridge the gap between the cmb scales and those probed by galaxy surveys such as 2-df and sdss",
