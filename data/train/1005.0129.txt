    "transition function_. let @xmath4 stand for the collection of all finite words over the alphabet @xmath2 , including the empty word .",
    "the function @xmath5 extends to a function @xmath6 ( still denoted by @xmath5 ) in the following natural way : for every @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we set @xmath9 if @xmath10 is empty and @xmath11 if @xmath12 for some @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "thus , via @xmath5 , every word @xmath8 acts on the set @xmath1 .",
    "a dfa @xmath0 is called _ synchronizing _ if the action of some word @xmath8 resets @xmath15 , that is , leaves the automaton in one particular state no matter at which state in @xmath1 it is applied : @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "any such word @xmath10 is said to be a _ reset word _ for the dfa .",
    "the minimum length of reset words for @xmath15 is called the _ reset length _ of @xmath15 .",
    "synchronizing automata serve as transparent and natural models of error - resistant systems in many applications ( coding theory , robotics , testing of reactive systems ) and also reveal interesting connections with symbolic dynamics and other parts of mathematics . for a brief introduction to the theory of synchronizing automata",
    "we refer the reader to the recent surveys  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the so - called ern conjecture that constitutes a major open problem in this area .    in  1964",
    "ern  @xcite constructed for each @xmath18 a synchronizing automaton@xmath19 with @xmath20 states whose reset length is @xmath21 . soon after that he conjectured that these automata represent the worst possible case , that is , every synchronizing automaton  with @xmath20 states can be reset by a word of length @xmath21 .",
    "this simply looking conjecture resists researchers efforts for more than 40 years . even though the conjecture has been confirmed for various restricted classes of synchronizing automata(cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) , no upper bound of magnitude @xmath22 for the reset length  of @xmath20-state synchronizing automata  is known in general .",
    "the best upper bound achieved so far is @xmath23 , see  @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties that one encounters when approaching the ern conjecture is that there are only very few _ extreme _ automata , that is , @xmath20-state synchronizing automata  with reset length @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , the ern series @xmath19 is the only known infinite series of extreme automata . besides that",
    ", only a few isolated examples of such automata have been found , see  @xcite for a complete list . moreover , even _",
    "slowly _ synchronizing automata , that is , automata with reset length close to the ern bound are very rare .",
    "this empirical observation is supported also by probabilistic arguments .",
    "for instance , the probability that a composition of @xmath24 random self - maps of a set of size @xmath20 is a constant map tends to  1 as @xmath20 goes to infinity  @xcite . in terms of automata",
    ", this result means that the reset length  of a random automaton with @xmath20 states and at least @xmath24 input letters does not exceed @xmath24 . for further results of the same flavor see  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is no hope to find new examples of slowly synchronizing automata  by a lucky chance or via a random sampling experiment .",
    "we therefore have designed and performed a set of exhaustive search experiments .",
    "our experiments are briefly described in section  [ experiments ] while the main body of the paper is devoted to a theoretical analysis of their outcome .",
    "we concentrate on two principal issues . in section  [ matrices ]",
    "we discuss a similarity between the distribution of reset lengths of synchronizing automataand the distribution of exponents of primitive digraphs .",
    "section  [ sss ] presents a few series of slowly synchronizing automata .",
    "most of these series have been expanded from new examples discovered in the course of our experiments . in our opinion ,",
    "the proof technique is also of interest ; in fact , we provide a transparent and uniform approach to all sufficiently large slowly synchronizing automata  with 2  input letters , both new and already known ones .",

    "as mentioned in section  [ intro ] , this paper has grown from certain observations made when we analyzed experimental results .",
    "one such observation has been a similarity between the `` upper parts '' of two sequences : the sequence of possible reset lengths of 2-letter synchronizing automata  with @xmath20 states and the sequence of possible exponents of primitive digraphs with @xmath20 vertices . as it is clear from theorem  [ dulmage ] ,",

    "this , however , does not suffice to explain similarities such as in table  [ 9 states ] because many of slowly synchronizing automata``responsible '' for non - zero entries in the third row can not be obtained as colorings of primitive digraphs with large exponents corresponding to non - zero entries in the second row . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate some new connections between primitive digraphs with large exponents and slowly synchronizing automata  with two input letters . in this way",

    "first we prove that the automaton @xmath149 is synchronizing and its reset length is @xmath91 .",
    "it is routine to verify that the word @xmath151 , whose length is @xmath152 , is a reset word for @xmath149 .",
    "now let @xmath10 be a reset word of minimum length  for @xmath149 .",
    "since the letter @xmath50 acts as cyclic permutation of @xmath1 , the word @xmath10 ends with @xmath49 .",
    "the action of @xmath49 sends the states @xmath20 and @xmath26 to the state 2 .",
    "therefore the action of @xmath10 also brings the automaton to the state @xmath46 and so does the action of the word @xmath112 for any @xmath111 .",
    "hence , for every @xmath113 , there is a path of length @xmath114 in @xmath147 from any given vertex @xmath115 to  2 . in particular , setting @xmath116 , we conclude that for every @xmath113 there is a cycle of length @xmath114 in @xmath147 .",
    "the digraph @xmath147 has only three simple cycles : one of length @xmath20 and two of length @xmath117 .",
    "since each cycle of @xmath147 must be composed from these three cycles , every number @xmath113 must be expressible as a non - negative integer combination of @xmath20 and @xmath117 .",
    "then lemma  [ sylvester ] implies that @xmath118 .",
    "suppose that @xmath119 .",
    "then in @xmath147 there should be a path of this length from the vertex  1 to the vertex  2 .",
    "the only outgoing edge of  1 is @xmath120 , and thus , in the path it must be followed by a cycle of length @xmath121 .",
    "no cycle of such length may exist by lemma  [ sylvester ] .",
    "hence @xmath122 .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath153 .",
    "there should be a path of this length from the vertex  @xmath117 to the vertex  2 .",
    "since @xmath50 is a cyclic permutation , the first letter of @xmath10 must be @xmath49 but @xmath49 sends @xmath117 to @xmath26 .",
    "therefore in @xmath147 there is a path of length @xmath90 from the vertex  @xmath26 to the vertex  2 .",
    "in the previous paragraph we have shown that this is not possible .",
    "hence @xmath154 .",
    "now we show that the automaton @xmath150 is synchronizing and its reset length is @xmath90 .    again , the word @xmath155 of length @xmath156 is easily seen to be a reset word for @xmath150 .",
    "now let @xmath10 be a reset word  for @xmath150 . then",
    ", as above , each @xmath113 must be the length of a cycle in the digraph @xmath147 whence @xmath118 by lemma  [ sylvester ] .",
    "the series @xmath149 is of interest because for @xmath157 it yields the maximum known value of reset length beyond the ern series @xmath19 and also the maximum known value of reset length for synchronizing automata  without loops .",
    "the series @xmath150 also enjoys an extremal property : it provides the maximum known value of reset length for synchronizing automata  in which no letter acts as a permutation .",
    "one more series of slowly synchronizing automata  related to the digraphs @xmath147 has reset length @xmath146 .",
    "it will be presented in an extended version of this paper .    except the ern series @xmath19 , the only infinite series of 2-letter slowly synchronizing automata  published so far was the series @xmath158 ( @xmath78 is odd ) constructed in  @xcite .",
