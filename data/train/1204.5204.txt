    "quasars were first discovered by maarten schmidt in 1963 as very distant , highly energetic stellar objects with a star like appearance . since the discovery of the first quasar , astronomers have been trying to reveal and understand the conditions of birth and existence of these immensely powerful objects .",
    "today , it is believed that quasars are the extremely luminous cores at the centers of distant galaxies , surrounding supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "binary quasars are pairs of quasars bound together by gravitational forces .",
    "binary quasars , like other quasars , are thought to be the products of galaxy mergers .",
    "recent observations indicate that a large number of bright quasars are hosted in massive spiral galaxies with really prominent disks ( letawe et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "in an early paper ( papadopoulos and caranicolas , 2005 ) , a simple dynamical model with a rotating disk and a massive nucleus was presented , in order to study the properties of motion in a quasar .",
    "furthermore , there is strong evidence ( letawe et al . , 2007 ) that interacting galaxies host powerful quasars with strong emission lines .",
    "it is also found that about @xmath0 of the observed host galaxies display signs of interaction , which are consistent with previous studies ( see hutchings & neff , 1992 ; bahcall et al .",
    ", 1997 ; boyce et al . , 1999 ; kaspi et al . , 2000 ; floyd et al . , 2004 ; jahnke et al . ,",
    "2004 ) . because most such mergers would have occurred in the very distant past , binary quasars and their associated galaxies , are very away and therefore , difficult for most telescopes to resolve .",
    "today , the only well known close binary pair of smbhs is oj 287 ( see sillanp et al . , 1988 and also later papers on oj 287 ) .",
    "sillanp et al .",
    "( 1988 ) conducted numerical experiments , using an @xmath1-body simulation code in order to study the mass flows .",
    "these simulations revealed that the inflow into the center of a black hole will produce an outburst .",
    "tidal interaction and thus the luminosity of the binary system , would be greatest in the last stages which is consistent with oj 287 being one of the brightest quasars .",
    "moreover , under the tidal triggering hypothesis , binary galaxies with morphological signs of interaction in their disks , should be more likely to display seyfert or quasar activity in their cores ( see byrd et al .",
    "1986 ; sundelius et al .",
    "1987 and references therein about accretion in interacting galaxies ) .",
    "therefore , it seems very challenging to construct a gravitational model of three degrees of freedom ( 3d ) , in order to study the dynamical properties in a pair of interacting disk galaxies hosting quasars .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in section 2 we present our gravitational dynamical model , which describes the motion in binary quasar stellar system . in section 3",
    "we provide an analysis of the 2d system , considering orbits in the galactic plane @xmath2 . in the next section ,",
    "we study the character of motion in the 3d system , using different kinds of dynamical methods .",
    "some interesting semi - numerical results are also provided in the same section . in section 5",
    "we use a 3d time dependent model , in order to follow the evolution of orbits as the host galaxies develop massive and dense quasars in their centers .",
    "we conclude with section 6 , where the discussion is presented and a comparison between the present theoretical results with observational data is made .",
    "our gravitational model consists of a pair of disk galaxies , each having a dense , massive and spherically symmetric nucleus .",
    "the potential which describes the motion in the first host galaxy ( hereafter galaxy g1 ) is given by the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the mass of the nucleus and the disk of galaxy 1 respectively , @xmath6 is the disk s scale length , @xmath7 is the disk s scale height , @xmath8 is the core radius of the disk halo , while @xmath9 is the scale length of the nucleus . the second host galaxy ( hereafter galaxy g2 )",
    "is described by the potential @xmath10 where again @xmath4 , @xmath11 is the mass of the nucleus and the disk of galaxy 2 respectively , @xmath12 is the disk s scale length , @xmath13 is the disk s scale height , @xmath14 is the core radius of the disk halo , while @xmath15 is the scale length of the nucleus .",
    "the disks of the two host galaxies are represented by the well known miyamoto - nagai model ( miyamoto & nagai , 1975 ) .",
    "the plummer sphere we choose to describe each nucleus , has been used many times in the past , in order to study the effects of the introduction of a central mass component in the core of a galaxy ( see hasan and norman , 1990 ; hasan et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "in our study we shall use the theory of the circular restricted three body problem ( see caranicolas and inanen , 2009 ; caranicolas and papadopoulos , 2009 ; caranicolas and zotos , 2009 ) .",
    "the two bodies move in circular orbits in an inertial frame oxyz , with the origin at the center of mass of the system , with a constant angular frequency @xmath16 , given by kepler s third law @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total mass of the system , while @xmath19 is the distance between the centers of the two galaxies .",
    "a clockwise , rotating frame oxyz , is used with axis oz coinciding with the axis oz and the axis ox coinciding with the straight line joining the two bodies . in this frame , which rotates with angular frequency @xmath20",
    ", the two galactic centers have fixed positions @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the total potential which is responsible for the motion of a star in the dynamical system of the binary quasar is @xmath23 where @xmath24 \\ \\ \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 with @xmath26    the angular frequency @xmath20 is calculated as follows : the two bodies move around their common mass center of the system with angular frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , given by @xmath29 as the two bodies are not mass points the two angular frequencies are not equal , in general .",
    "however , this issue can easily be resolved .",
    "the angular frequencies of the two bodies , can become equal under reasonable assumptions .",
    "this is justified , if the final set of the parameters has physical meaning and represents satisfactorily the dynamical system .",
    "the equation @xmath30 leads to an eightfold infinity of solutions in the eight unknowns @xmath31 .",
    "if one chooses proper values ( representing the dynamical system ) , lets say for the seven parameters @xmath32 , then equation @xmath30 gives only two values for the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "one value is positive , while the other is negative and is rejected .",
    "the author would like to make clear that , after choosing properly the parameters , the deviation between the two angular frequencies is negligible , so that @xmath33 is of order of @xmath34 or even smaller and @xmath35 or @xmath36 is of order of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , we consider the two angular frequencies practically equal , that is @xmath38 . moreover , the treatment of large bodies with spherical symmetry as mass points is very common in celestial modeling .",
    "this method is quite familiar to those measuring the masses of disk galaxies .",
    "the fact that the two bodies ( host galaxies ) , are sufficiently apart from each other , allow us to assume that the tidal phenomena are very small and therefore negligible .    in this rotating frame",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath39 where the dot indicates derivative with respect to the time .",
    "the only integral of motion for the system of differential equations ( 9 ) , is the jacobi integral given by the equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the momenta per unit mass conjugate to @xmath42 , while @xmath43 is the numerical value of the jacobi integral .",
    "all numerical outcomes of the present work , are based on the numerical integration of the equations of motion ( 9 ) , which was made using a bulirsh - ster routine in fortran 95 , with double precision in all subroutines .",
    "the accuracy of the calculations was checked by the consistency of the jacobi integral ( 10 ) , which was conserved up to the eighteenth significant figure .    in this article , we shall use a system of galactic units , where the unit of length is 20 kpc , the unit of mass is @xmath44 and the unit of time is @xmath45 yr .",
    "the velocity unit is 197 km / s , while @xmath46 is equal to unity ( see vozikis & caranicolas , 1992 ) . in these units",
    ", we use the values : @xmath47 .",
    "the values of the above quantities of the dynamical system remain constant during this research , while the values of @xmath48 and @xmath19 are treated as parameters .",
    "the above numerical values of the constant dynamical quantities of the system , secure positive density everywhere and free of singularities .",
    "figure 1a - c shows the contours of the projections of the iso - potential curves @xmath49 , on the @xmath50 planes respectively .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "lighter colors indicate higher values of @xmath43 .",
    "figure 2 shows the contours of the iso - potential curves @xmath49 , on the @xmath53 plane , with some additional details regarding the stability and the structure of the dynamical system .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 are the five lagrange equilibrium points , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the centers of the two galaxies at a distance @xmath57 . at these equilibrium points",
    "we have @xmath58 @xmath59 are the unstable saddle equilibrium points , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the triangular points ( see binney & tremaine , 2008 ) .",
    "in this section we shall investigate the properties of motion in the hamiltonian system of two degrees of freedom ( 2d ) .",
    "this can be derived from equation ( 10 ) , if we set @xmath62 .",
    "then the corresponding hamiltonian writes @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the numerical value of @xmath65 . as",
    "the dynamical system is now 2-dimensional , we can use the classical method of the @xmath66 poincar surface of section , in order to determine the regular or chaotic character of motion .",
    "the results obtained from the study of the 2d system , will be used in order to help us to understand the structure of the more complicated phase space of the 3d system , which will be presented in the following section .",
    "figure 3a shows the @xmath67 phase plane , when the distance between the centers of the two galaxies is @xmath57 .",
    "the values of the other parameters are : @xmath68 .",
    "the value of the jacobi integral is @xmath69 .",
    "we observe that the regular motion is confined around the stable retrograde periodic point , in the galaxy 1 ( g1 ) , while in the galaxy 2 ( g2 ) there are regular regions around both , the direct ( i.e. in the same direction as the rotation ) and the retrograde periodic points .",
    "the rest of the phase plane is occupied by a large unified chaotic sea surrounding both host galaxies .",
    "there are also some small islands , corresponding to secondary resonances .",
    "another interesting point in fig .",
    "3a , is the high velocities , observed near the the centers of the two host galaxies .",
    "this results from the presence of the dense nucleus in each galactic core and it is characteristic of nuclear galactic activity . figure 3b is similar to fig .",
    "3a , but when @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "as the total mass of the system is conserved , this means that now the mass is on the disks of the two galaxies . in this case",
    ", the pattern has one main difference from the pattern shown in fig . 3a . here",
    "the chaotic regions are low near the center of each galaxy and the velocities near the two galactic cores are smaller compared to those of fig .",
    "therefore , one can say , that the structure of chaos in both galaxies is not only a result of galactic interaction , but it is also a result of nuclear galactic activity . in other words , the presence of the quasars in each galactic core affects drastically the character of motion in the host galaxies .",
    "moreover , the absence of the quasars reduces the velocities near the centers of the two host galaxies .",
    "figure 4a is similar to fig .",
    "3a but when the distance between the centers of two the galaxies is @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this case",
    "the two galaxies do not communicate directly in the @xmath67 phase plane and therefore , we can observe two separate regions of motion around each galaxy . the majority of orbits around the direct and retrograde periodic points in each galaxy is ordered .",
    "there is a considerable chaotic region , mainly near the central regions of each host galaxy .",
    "high velocities are once more observed , near the galactic cores of the two host galaxies , while some secondary resonances are also present .",
    "figure 4b is similar to fig . 3b but when the two host galaxies ( g1 and g2 ) are quiet . here , the secondary resonances look more prominent . furthermore , as the quasars are absent ,",
    "the velocities near the center of the two galactic cores are smaller than those observed in fig . 4a .",
    "figure 5a is similar to fig . 2a but when the distance between the centers of the two galaxies is @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "once more , there are two separate regions of motion around each host galaxy .",
    "there is a relatively small chaotic layer , confined mainly near the central region of each galaxy , while the rest of the phase plane is covered by regular orbits circulating around the stable direct and retrograde periodic points .",
    "some small sticky regions are also present in both galaxies .",
    "figure 5b is similar to fig .",
    "3b , but when the two host galaxies ( g1 and g2 ) are quiet .",
    "all orbits in both galaxies seem to be regular .",
    "chaotic motion was not observed and , if present , is negligible .",
    "therefore , we can say that , the two interacting host galaxies , for large separations , do not show chaotic motion when the quasars are not present in their galactic cores .",
    "our numerical results suggest that there are two kinds of chaotic orbits : ( i ) chaotic orbits approaching both galaxies and ( ii ) chaotic orbits that approach only one of the two host galaxies . later in this section",
    ", we will see that whether a chaotic orbit approaches the two galaxies or only one of them , strongly depends on the integration time of the particular orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "the ordered orbits circulate around only one of the two host galaxies .",
    "it would be of particular interest , to find regular orbits that could circulate around both host galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , this kind of ordered orbits does not exist in our gravitational model , which describes a system of two interacting galaxies that host quasars in their cores .",
    "figure 6a shows the percentage @xmath76 of the @xmath67 phase planes covered by chaotic orbits as a function of the distance between the centers of the two active host galaxies .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath77 , while the value of the jacobi integral is @xmath69 . in this case",
    ", the quasars are present in the cores of two host galaxies g1 and g2 .",
    "the value of the angular frequency @xmath20 is calculated for each particular value of the distance @xmath19 from equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the range of values regarding the distance between the centers of the two galaxies is @xmath78 .",
    "this particular range was chosen so as the two galaxies do not communicate with each other directly , producing two separate @xmath67 phase planes , in order to be able to calculate the chaotic percentage of each phase plane more easily .",
    "the lower limit of the above range , is the minimum distance between the centers of the two galaxies , for which we have two separate @xmath67 phase planes as those shown in figs . 4a and 5a .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "6a that the percentage @xmath76 decreases exponentially , as the distance @xmath19 increases , for both active galaxies g1 and g2 .",
    "figure 6b is similar to fig .",
    "6a but for the case when the quasars are not present in the cores of the two galaxies .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath79 , while the value of the jacobi integral is @xmath69 . here again the the percentage @xmath76 decreases exponentially , as the distance @xmath19 increases , for both quiet galaxies g1 and g2 . a more detailed view of figs .",
    "6a and 6b reveals that for each particular value of the distance @xmath19 , the chaotic percentage @xmath76 is always smaller when the quasars are not present , in both host galaxies g1 and g2 . we must point out , that the percentage @xmath76 is calculated as follows : we choose 1000 orbits with different and random initial conditions @xmath80 in each phase plane and then divide the number of those who produce chaotic orbits to the total number of orbits .",
    "figure 7a shows a plot of the average value of the maximum lyapunov characteristic exponent - lce ( see lichtenberg and lieberman , 1992 ) as a function of the distance between the centers of the two active host galaxies .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath77 , while the value of the jacobi integral is @xmath69 . in this case , the quasars are present in the cores of two host galaxies g1 and g2 . the value of the angular frequency @xmath20 is calculated for each particular value of the distance @xmath19 from equation ( 3 ) .",
    "one can see , in fig .",
    "7a , that @xmath81 decreases linearly as the distance @xmath19 increases for both cases ( g1 and g2 ) .",
    "figure 7b is similar to fig .",
    "7a but for the case when the quasars are not present in the cores of the two galaxies .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath79 , while the value of the jacobi integral is @xmath69 . here",
    "again @xmath81 decreases linearly , as the distance @xmath19 increases , for both quiet galaxies g1 and g2 .",
    "once more , as we have pointed out in figs .",
    "6a and 6b , for each particular value of the distance @xmath19 , the average value @xmath81 is always smaller when the quasars are not present , for both galaxies g1 and g2 .",
    "here we must note , that it is well known that the value of lce is different in each chaotic component ( see saito & ichimura , 1979 ) . as we have in all cases regular regions and only one unified chaotic sea in each @xmath67 phase plane",
    ", we calculate the average value of lce by taking 500 orbits with different and random initial conditions @xmath80 in the chaotic sea in each case .",
    "note that , all calculated lces were different on the fifth decimal point in the same chaotic region .",

    "figure 8a shows an orbit circulating around host galaxy 1 , with initial conditions : @xmath82 , while the value of @xmath83 is obtained from the jacobi integral ( 12 ) for all orbits .",

    "a regular orbit starting at the center of galaxy 1 , with initial conditions : @xmath90 , is given in figure 8h .",
    "the values of all other parameters for this orbit are as in fig .",
    "all regular orbits were calculated for a time period of 150 time units .",
    "figure 9a - d shows four different chaotic orbits of the 2d dynamical system . in figure 9a we can see a chaotic orbit with initial conditions : @xmath91 , approaching only host galaxy 1 . the time interval of the numerical integration for this orbit is 180 time units .",
    "figure 9b shows a chaotic orbit approaching only host galaxy 2 .",
    "the initial conditions are : @xmath92 , while the time of the numerical integration is 110 time units . in figure 9c we observe a chaotic orbit approaching both galaxies .",
    "the initial conditions are : @xmath93 , while the time of the numerical integration is 300 time units .",
    "so far , one may conclude that there are two kinds of chaotic orbits , as we have mentioned previously .",
    "however , numerical simulations of a large number of chaotic orbits ( about 1000 ) with different initial conditions @xmath94 , show that inevitably all chaotic orbits will approach both galaxies , after a certain time interval .",
    "therefore , the crucial factor is the time interval of the numerical integration .",
    "this can be shown better in figure 9d .",
    "this chaotic orbit has the same initial conditions as the orbit shown in fig .",
    "9a , but the time of the numerical integration this time , is equal to 250 time units .",
    "we can see that now the orbit approaches both host galaxies .",

    "when the centers of the two galaxies located at distances @xmath19 such as they do not communicate directly in the @xmath67 phase plane ( see figs .",

    "one way to overcome this problem , is to project the surface of section to space with lower dimensions .",
    "in fact we will apply the method introduced by pfenniger ( 1984 ) ( see also revaz and pfenniger , 2001 ) .",

    "the projected points on the @xmath118 plane shows nearly invariant curves around the periodic points at @xmath119 , as long as the coupling is weak .",
    "when the coupling is stronger the corresponding projections in @xmath118 plane shows increasing departure of the plane periodic point , up to making a direct orbit a retrograde one and vise versa .",

    "if consequents in the @xmath118 section of the 3d orbit drop in one of the two domains of the corresponding section of 2d orbits at the same value of the jacobi integral @xmath43 , we can distinguish between direct and retrograde motion .",
    "orbits which visit both domains are intermittently direct or retrograde .",
    "figure 12a - d shows four typical @xmath118 sections of 3d orbits , starting with initial conditions close to different periodic points on the @xmath120 phase planes of the 2d system . in order to obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "12a we have taken the point @xmath121 representing approximately the position of the retrograde periodic point in the @xmath120 phase plane of fig . 3a for the active host galaxy 1 .",

    "the position of the periodic point this time is @xmath124 .",
    "note that in all cases the numerical results indicate , that for small values of @xmath110 the motion is regular , while for larger values of @xmath110 the motion become chaotic .",

    "we must emphasize that the results shown in fig .",
    "12a - d are rather qualitative and can be considered as an indication that the transition from regularity to chaos in 3d orbits , occurs as the value of @xmath110 increases . in order to form a more complete and accurate view of the phase space in the 3d system , we computed a large number of 3d orbits ( approximately 1000 ) near in each periodic point of the @xmath120 phase planes of 2d system , for different initial conditions @xmath94 and also for different values of @xmath110 .",
    "our target was to determine the average minimum value of @xmath110 for which the nature of a 3d orbit changes from regular to chaotic .",

    "3a - b , 4a - b and 5a - b , for three different values of distance between the centers of the two host galaxies @xmath19 . from table 1",
    "we can induce three important results .",
    "( i ) . in every case",
    "( active or quiet galaxy ) the minimum value of @xmath110 in the regions near the retrograde stable periodic points , is always larger than the corresponding of the regions of the direct periodic points .",
    "if we compare each set of galaxies regarding their nuclear activity , ( active g1,2 with quiet 1,2 ) for the same distance @xmath19 , we observe that when the quasars are not present at the galactic cores ( quiet - non active galaxies ) , the 3d orbits can approach higher values of @xmath110 and remain regular . on the other hand , when the quasars are present , the value of @xmath125 is smaller .",
    "as the distance between the centers of the galaxies increases , the minimum initial value of @xmath110 for which a 3d can remain regular , increases in both cases ( active and quiet galaxies ) .",
    "this means that as the two galaxies are in large distances , their mutual interactions are weak enough and therefore the majority of 3d orbits are ordered .",
    "moreover , in large distances one can conclude that the main responsible for the observed chaotic motion is the nuclear activity of the quasars in the cores of each host galaxy .",

    "in the present article , we have constructed a simple 3d gravitational model , in order to study the character of motion in a binary quasar dynamical model . in particular , we present a model for a binary pair of galaxies , following a circular orbit with galactic disks that are aligned with the orbital plane . each galaxy is assumed to host a massive black hole at its core .",
    "the motion of a test particle ( star ) , in the gravitational field of this system is studied and various techniques are used to identify regular and chaotic motion .",
    "we have chosen the host galaxies , in our dynamical model , to be disk galaxies due to the fact that the belief that bright quasars reside in massive ellipticals ( dunlop et al . , 2003 ) , must be revised as recent observations indicate that the majority of bright quasars are hosted in disk galaxies ( letawe et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "observational data regarding radial velocities have shown that the masses of the large spirals are about @xmath126 solar masses .",
    "this mass is consistent with the mass of our disk galaxy 1 . as observational data reveal that about @xmath0 of the host galaxies show signs of gravitational interactions , we have decided to present a binary quasar dynamical model of three degrees of freedom , based on a pair of two interacting host galaxies .",
    "a binary system of interacting galaxies hosting quasars in their cores is very complex and therefore , we need to assume some necessary simplifications and assumptions , in order to be able to study the orbital behavior of such a complicated stellar system .",
    "thus , our model is simple and contrived , in order to give us the ability to study different aspects of the dynamical model but nevertheless , contrived models can provide insight into more realistic stellar systems , which unfortunately are very difficult to be studied if we take into account all the astrophysical aspects . here",
    ", we must point out the main restrictions and limitations of our gravitational model .",
    "( i ) the two host galaxies are assumed to be coplanar and orbiting each other in the same plane on circular orbits .",
    "( ii ) our dynamical model only deals with the non - dissipative components of the host galaxies , stars or possibly dark matter particles .",
    "it may be that gas accretion would be even more important to the question addressed in the present study .",
    "( iii ) the potentials we use are rigid and do not respond to the evolving density distribution in a more realistic way .",
    "this is because our gravitational model which describes the binary system of the host galaxies is not self - consistent .",
    "self - consistent models are usually deployed when we want to conduct @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "obviously this is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "once more , we have to state that the above restrictions and limitations of our model are necessary because otherwise , it would be extremely difficult or even impossible to apply the extensive and detailed dynamical study presented in our study .",
    "in our research , two different cases were investigated : the time independent model and the evolving model , that is the case when mass is transported from the disks of the galaxies to their centers forming a massive and dense quasar in each galactic core . our numerical calculation indicate that there are several factors responsible for the observed chaotic motion , in the time independent model : ( i ) the galactic interaction , ( ii ) the galactic activity , that is the presence of the quasars and ( iii ) the lindblad resonances .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the quasars increases the velocities near the central regions of the host galaxies .",
    "the value of the velocity depends on the mass of the dense nucleus and the value of its scale length .",
    "regular motion corresponds to low central velocities , while chaotic motion is characterized by high velocities .",
    "all the above , strongly indicates that in the centers of active galaxies chaotic motion in high velocities is expected . on the other hand",
    ", it was found that the two interacting galaxies , for large values of the distance between their centers @xmath19 , do not present chaotic motion , when the massive quasars are not present in their cores .    as we have mentioned previously ,",
    "one of the factors responsible for the chaotic motion and other resonance phenomena , such as islandic motion , are several inner lindblad resonances @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 indicate the circular and the epicycle frequency of the star respectively , while @xmath130 and @xmath131 are integers .",
    "the main resonances for the two hosts galaxies in both cases ( active and quiet ) together with the corresponding resonance radii @xmath132 and @xmath133 , when @xmath57 and @xmath134 are given in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 20a shows a plot of the curves @xmath135 for the active host galaxy 1 , as a function of the radius @xmath136 .",
    "the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 indicate the curves @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "the straight lines are the curves @xmath139 .",
    "the values of all the other parameters are as in fig .",
    "figure 20b is similar to fig .",
    "20a but for the active host galaxy 2 . as we can see there is a considerable number of resonance radii for both the direct and retrograde orbits in both host galaxies .",
    "details regarding the resonances and the resonance radii can be obtained form tables 2 and 3 . in other words , all the lindblad resonances given in tables 2 and 3 , are also responsible for the chaotic motion in the two host galaxies .",
    "things are very similar when the quasars are not present in the cores of the two host galaxies .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the above resonances produce large chaotic regions for small values of the distance @xmath19 , while for larger values of @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "5a - b ) the chaotic regions are small , although the resonance radii are still present .",
    "this means that in this case the distance between the two galaxies precedence the lindblad resonances .    in order to explore and understand the nature of orbits in the 3d dynamical system",
    ", we have used our knowledge obtained from the study of the 2d system .",
    "of particular interest was the determination of the regions of initial conditions in the @xmath140 phase space that produce regular or chaotic 3d orbits .",
    "as the value of @xmath83 was found from the jacobi integral ( 10 ) , we have used the same value of @xmath43 , as in the 2d system and took initial conditions @xmath141 such as @xmath142 lies in the chaotic regions of the 2d system .",
    "it was found that the motion is chaotic for all permissible values of @xmath110 . on the other hand , in the case when @xmath142 was inside a regular region around the direct and retrograde periodic points ,",
    "the corresponding 3d orbits are regular for small values of @xmath110 , while for larger values of @xmath110 the orbits become chaotic .",
    "the particular values of @xmath110 for which the transition from regularity to chaos in 3d orbits is occurred were different for each regular region of the 2d system .",
    "of particular interest are the results given in table 1 , where we define the average minimum value of @xmath110 for each case near the direct and retrograde periodic points , in both host galaxies .",
    "an important role is played by the @xmath143 component of the test particle s angular momentum .",
    "it was found that the values of @xmath144 for regular 3d orbits are larger , than those corresponding to chaotic 3d orbits .",
    "thus , the @xmath143 component of the angular momentum is a significant dynamical parameter connected with the regular or chaotic character of orbits in both 2d and 3d dynamical systems .    in order to estimate the degree of chaos in the 2d as well as in the 3d dynamical system ,",
    "we have computed the average value of the maximum lyapunov characteristic exponent - lce , for a large number of orbits with different initial conditions in the chaotic regions in each case , for a time period of @xmath145 time units .",
    "note that all the calculated lces were different on the fifth decimal point in the same chaotic region .",
    "the numerical results indicate that the degree of chaos in the 3d binary quasar system is smaller than in similar 2d systems .",
    "it is of great interest to follow the evolution of orbits as the quasars are formed in the central regions of the host disk galaxies . in this procedure , mass is transported from the disks to the nuclei of both galaxies and therefore the quiet galaxies become gradually active , following equations ( 19 ) .",
    "we observe that the final character of the 3d orbits strongly depends on the particular initial conditions @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , regular orbits can turn to chaotic and vice versa , or maintain their character ( ordered or chaotic ) during the quasar s formation and since the quasars have been formed .",
    "it was observed that a number of regular quasi periodic orbits , starting near the central regions of each host galaxy , become chaotic .",
    "this can been seen in a velocity vs. time plot , where the asymmetric profile of the total velocity is in agreement with observational data ( see grosbl , 2002 ) , where an increase of the stellar velocity is expected , in regions with significant chaoticity .",
    "moreover , observations show that an asymmetric velocity profile indicates chaotic motion .",
    "an interesting question is whether interactions is essential in order to trigger the mass transportation and therefore the galactic activity .",
    "this question remains unsolved as observational astronomers have found binary systems with disk galaxies ( see letawe et al . , 2006 )",
    "showing no signs of interaction at all but harboring active nuclei .",
    "forty years ago , galactic activity and interactions between galaxies were viewed as unusual and rare .",
    "nowadays , they seem to be segments in the life of many galaxies . from the astrophysical point of view , in the present work , we have tried to connect galactic activity and galactic interactions with the nature of orbits ( regular or chaotic ) and also with the behavior of the velocities of stars in host disk galaxies .",
    "we consider the outcomes of the present research , to be an initial effort , in order to explore the dynamical structure of the 3d binary quasar system , in more detail .",
    "as results are positive , further investigation will be initiated to study all the available phase space , including orbital eccentricity of the small host galaxy ( the galaxy with the smallest value of the total mass ) and its inclinations to the primary host galaxy .",
    "moreover , we shall use the outcomes obtained from this initial dynamical study so as to conduct computer @xmath1-body simulations in a system of interacting galaxies , in order to reveal the change in their orbital properties , throughout merger processes and tidal effects , which are out of the scope of our present work .",
    "i would like to express my warmest thanks to the anonymous referee for his careful reading of the manuscript and also for his very useful suggestions and comments , which improved greatly the quality and the clarity of the present paper ."
