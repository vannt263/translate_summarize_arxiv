    "a highly motivated and well defined problem in computational astrophysics is to compute the non - linear structure of dark matter halos .",
    "this is especially timely given the abundance of new high resolution data that probe the central structure of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", a standard cosmological paradigm has been defined that gives a well defined framework within which to perform numerical calculations of structure formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this subject has developed rapidly over the past few years , building upon the pioneering results obtained in the early 1990 s by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , the systematic study of many halos at a low resolution led to the proposal that the profile of an ` average ' cold dark matter halo in dynamical equilibrium could be fit by an universal two parameter function @xcite , with a slope of that asymptotically approaches @xmath5 as @xmath6 . at the same time , the study of a few halos at high resolution questioned these results ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these latter authors claimed that of the order a million particles within the virialised region where necessary to resolve the halo structure to 1% and the slopes at that radius could be significantly steeper . just within the last few months , we have seen several groups publish reasonably large samples of halos simulated with the necessary resolution that we can finally determine the scatter in the density profiles across a range of mass scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "much of the recent controversy in the literature has been due to limited statistics and the lack of agreement over what is a reliable radius to trust a given simulation with a given set of parameters .",
    "several studies have attempted to address this issue ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "integration and force accuracy can be understood using controlled test simulations .",
    "however , discreteness is probably the most important and least understood numerical effect that can influence our numerical results which is exacerbated due to the lack of an analytic solution with which to compare simulations .",
    "our particle sampling of the nearly collisionless fluid we attempt to simulate can lead to energy transfer and mass redistribution , particularly in the central regions that we are often most interested in .",
    "collisional effects in the final object or in the early hierarchy of objects can be reduced by increasing the number of particles @xmath7 in a simulation @xcite .",
    "the limitation to the phase space densities that can be resolved due to discreteness in the initial conditions can also be overcome by increasing the resolution @xcite .",
    "as we increase the resolution within a particular non - linear structure , we find that the global properties of the resolved structure is retained , including shape , density profile , substructure mass functions and even the positions of the infalling substructures .",
    "this gives us confidence that our @xmath7-body calculations are not biased by using finite @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the fact that increasing the resolution allows us to resolve smaller radii is important since the baryons often probe just the central few percent of a dark matter structure - the latest observations of galaxy and clusters probe the mass distribution within one percent of the virial radius , which until recently was unresolved by numerical simulations .",
    "forthcoming experiments , such as veritas @xcite and magic @xcite will probe the structure of dark matter halos on even smaller scales by attempting to detect gamma - rays from dark matter annihilation within the central hundred parsecs ( @xmath8 ) of the galactic halo ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these scales are still below the resolution limit of todays cosmological simulations , the estimates of the dark matter densities in these regions are still based on extrapolations which introduce large uncertainties    a simple estimate of the scaling of @xmath7 with time shows remarkable progress over and above that predicted by moore s law .",
    "the first computer simulations used of the order @xmath9 particles and force resolution of the order of the half mass radii @xcite . today we can follow up to @xmath10 particles with a resolution of @xmath11 of the final structure . the increase in resolution is significantly faster than predicted by moore s law since equally impressive gains in performance have been due to advances in software .",
    "we are finally at the stage whereaby the dark matter clustering is understood at a level where the uncertainties are dominated by the influence of the baryonic component .",
    "it is therefore a good time to review and compare existing results from different groups together with a set of new simulations that we have carried out that are the state of the art in this subject and represent what is achievable with several months of dedicated supercomputer time . for certain problems , such as predicting the annihilation flux discussed earlier , it would be necessary to significantly increase the resolution .",
    "this is not possible with existing resources and new techniques should be explored .",
    "we begin by presenting our new simulations in section 2 .",
    "section 3 discusses convergence tests and the asymptotic best fit density profiles . in section 4",
    "we compare our results with recently published results from four other groups mentioned above .",
    "table [ tab1 ] gives an overview of the simulations we present in this paper . with up to @xmath12 particles inside the virial radius of a cluster and an effective @xmath13 timesteps , they are among the highest resolution @xmath0cdm simulations performed so far .",
    "they represent a major investment of computing time , the largest run was completed in about @xmath13 cpu hours on the zbox supercomputer.stadel/zbox/ ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have carried out a series of six very high resolution calculations of the structure of cluster mass objects in a hierarchical universe .",
    "the clusters contain up to 25 million particles and have force softening as small as @xmath14 .",
    "a convergence analysis demonstrates that for our treecode with our integration scheme , the radius beyond which we can trust the density profiles scale according to the mean interparticle separation . in the best case we reach a resolution of about @xmath15 .",
    "neither of the two parameter functions , the nfw and m99 profiles , are very good fits over the whole resolved range in most clusters .",
    "one additional free parameter is needed to fit all six clusters : the asymptotically flat profile from @xcite and an nfw profile with variable inner slope provide much improved fits .",
    "the best fit inner slopes are @xmath4 .",
    "_ below _ the resolved radius the two fitting formulas used are very different .",
    "future simulations with much higher resolution will show which one ( if either ) of the two is still a good approximation on scales of @xmath14 and smaller .",
    "we compare our results with simulations from other groups who used independent codes and initial conditions .",
    "we find a good agreement between the cluster density profiles calculated with different algorithms . from @xmath16",
    "the scatter in the profiles is nearly constant and equal to about 0.17 in logarithmic slope . at one percent of the virial radius (",
    "defined such that the mean density within @xmath17 is @xmath18 ) the slope of the density profiles is @xmath19 .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for many useful comments and detailed suggestions .",
    "we are grateful to toshiyuki fukushige , eric hayashi , argyro tasitsiomi and paul bode for providing the density profile data from their cluster simulations .",
    "we thank the swiss center for scientific computing in manno for computing time to generate the initial conditions for our simulations .",
    "all other computations were performed on the zbox supercomputer at the university of zurich .",
