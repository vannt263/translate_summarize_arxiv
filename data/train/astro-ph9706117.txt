    "the wind of massive stars is primarily driven by the interaction with stellar radiation in many lines ( lucy & solomon @xcite ) . based on this concept , the theory of castor , abbott , and klein ( @xcite hereafter cak ) can explain many aspects of hot star winds .",
    "but the basic model of cak fails to describe the strong winds observed in some massive stars , including wolf - rayet stars . beside multiple scattering effects ( gayley et al.@xcite ) a rotating magnetic field as driving force were proposed ( friend & macgregor @xcite , poe et al .",
    "@xcite , maheswaran & cassinelli @xcite , and biermann & cassinelli @xcite ) to overcome this problem .",
    "we emphasize , that the observations of nonthermal radio emission from ob ( bieging et al .",
    "@xcite ) and wolf - rayet stars ( abbott et al.@xcite ) give clear evidence for non neglible magnetic fields on these stars . on the other hand direct observations",
    "give only rather high limits on the magnetic field ( landstreet @xcite ) , especially for very early - type stars .",
    "landstreet s sample contains only one o - star ( o9.5 ) , which is not massive enough to form a wolf - rayet star later .",
    "further indirect hints for a strong magnetic field come from radio observations of supernova explosions ( biermann & cassinelli @xcite , biermann et al.@xcite , biermann @xcite ) .",
    "more observations ( e.g.ignace et al .",
    "@xcite ) are necessary , before our model can be verified or ruled out .",
    "previous models for rotating magnetic stars suffer from one serious problem : a sufficient enhancement of the wind is connected to a severe loss of angular momentum .",
    "the star would spin down faster than is allowed from stellar evolution .",
    "but maheswaran & cassinelli ( @xcite ) argued that a massive star could even reach the wolf - rayet phase as a fast magnetic rotator .",
    "magnetic fields may also play an important role in rotationally compressed winds ( cassinelli et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    another important feature of hot star winds is the instability of the radiation force , which leads to a highly perturbed wind .",
    "the stability and propagation of linear hydrodynamical waves in the radiation field of the star were analyzed by owocki & rybicki ( @xcite hereafter or , and @xcite ) , who unified prior work by macgregor et al.(@xcite ) and abbott ( @xcite ) .",
    "they found that the linear waves grow very rapidly and therefore can not be neglected in an overall model .",
    "the resulting waves can influence the stellar wind in two ways : ( i ) they can gain momentum and energy from the radiation field , transport it , and later dissipate it into the wind .",
    "this can help to drive the unperturbed wind ( koninx @xcite ) e.g.  by increasing the real @xmath1 at the base of the wind , where shocks might not have formed yet .",
    "( ii ) waves can also steepen into shocks and influence the observation of fundamental wind parameters : the _ observed _ terminal velocity @xmath2 is inferred from the blue edge of p - cygni lines",
    ". this _ maximal _",
    "velocity has to be compared with the unperturbed @xmath2 plus the velocity amplitude of the waves or , if _",
    "outward _ running waves have already steepened into outward running shocks , to the unperturbed @xmath2 plus the shock speed .",
    "the last scenario is more probable due to the high amplification rates found in or .",
    "krolik & raymond ( @xcite ) and macfarlane & cassinelli ( @xcite ) analyzed the structure of a single outward running shock shell in a nonmagnetic wind and found that the shock shell is driven by the radiation field to a velocity much higher than the velocity of sound .",
    "the _ observed _ values for the mass loss rate @xmath1 are influenced by waves in two ways : ( i ) @xmath1 is inferred from observed values of the density @xmath3 by @xmath4 .",
    "an overestimated @xmath2 therefore leads to an overestimated @xmath1 .",
    "( ii ) the values for @xmath3 are inferred from observed radio or uv fluxes .",
    "a matter distribution perturbed by waves or shocks generates higher fluxes , which lead to higher values for @xmath3 if the perturbations are not taken into account properly ( abbott et al .",
    "@xcite and hillier @xcite ) .",
    "shocks are also a good source for the observed x - rays from hot stars .",
    "lucy ( @xcite ) developed a heuristic model consisting of a chain of outward running forward shocks mainly in order to describe the x - ray emission from hot stars . but owocki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found in a nonlinear time - dependent calculation , that waves in the stellar wind are dominantly running inward and steepen into inward running , reverse shocks . in this case",
    "the arguments about @xmath2 and also koninx s model do not apply , so that such waves can not significantly help to explain the high values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 observed in the wind of massive stars .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show in the limit of a linear analysis that the objections of owocki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) do not apply , if a strong magnetic field and rotation are present .",
    "therefore we join the ideas of a rotating magnetic field ( maheswaran & cassinelli @xcite,@xcite ) and of unstable waves ( owocki & rybicki @xcite(or ) ) in the wind of a massive star and do a linear stability analysis .",
    "we show that the magnetic field increases the number of wave modes and changes their properties significantly .",
    "high phase velocities can be achieved due to the high alfvn velocity .",
    "therefore inward running waves will not be advected outward and will not steepen into reverse shocks anymore , which dominate at large radii . furthermore outward and inward",
    "running waves have the same growth timescale in the short wavelength regime where both modes are unstable .",
    "so we can expect outward running waves far from the star and forward shocks in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this model does not exclude multiple scattering as described e.g.  by lucy & abbott ( @xcite ) or gayley et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "rather both could be joined to create a model for an even stronger wind .    in sect .  2 we derive the dispersion relation for radiatively amplified waves in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "in sect .  3 we discuss our unperturbed wind models . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the waves we found for the wind models of sect .  3 . in sect .  5",
    "we discuss the observational consequences of our model . and in sect .",
    "6 we describe some conclusions .",
    "to analyze waves in the wind of hot stars we start from the equations of magnetohydrodynamics for a compressible , nonviscous , perfectly conducting fluid as described in jackson ( @xcite ) and add the analytic description of or for the influence of the stellar radiation on the plasma . or was criticized by lucy ( @xcite ) for the neglect of damping due to diffuse radiation . but owocki & rybicki ( @xcite ) showed that this effect reduces the amplification rate only by approximately 50% at one stellar radius and 20% at infinity . in this initial paper",
    "we emphasize the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore we choose the simple description of or instead of the more exact but also more involved description of owocki & rybicki ( @xcite ) or the description of gayley & owocki ( @xcite ) , who analyzed the instability in optically thick winds .",
    "we start with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the force term due to radiation pressure .",
    "now we express the pressure @xmath7 by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the speed of sound , and replace @xmath3 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 by sums of a equilibrium value and a perturbation . in the comoving reference frame",
    "@xmath12  refer to the unperturbed wind .",
    "] this is : @xmath13 equations [ basiceqn1][basiceqn3 ] give to first order in small quantities : @xmath14 we assume now , that the radiative force acts only in radial direction and depends only on the radial velocity .",

    "if we use the result of or for the linear perturbation of the radiative force , we can get a dispersion relation from this wave equation for plane waves : @xmath18 equation [ waveeqn ] then becomes : @xmath19 -\\frac{\\omega k_r}{{\\bar{\\chi}}+ { { \\rm i}}k_r}\\omega ( { \\delta{\\vec{v}}}\\cdot{\\vec{e}_r}){\\vec{e}_r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we used the analytic form of the perturbation of the radiation force derived in or .",

    "we have @xmath35 .",
    "this leads to higher phase velocities for both modes and reduces the relative difference between inward and outward waves .",
    "additionally inward running waves are not advected outward by the average wind motion any more , because their phase velocity is higher than the velocity of the unperturbed wind . in the short wave length limit @xmath36",
    "we find @xmath37 these waves propagate , if @xmath38 is less than @xmath39 , with the same phase velocity inward and outward .",

    "the rotating magnetic field provides an additional driving force , which changes the properties of the wind drastically .",
    "the terminal velocity decreases and the mass loss rate increases .",
    "the wind efficiency @xmath52 is 3.8 , which is much higher than for a purely radiatively driven wind in the single scattering limit , where the efficiency can not be higher than unity . in spite of the known spin down problem we choose a strong magnetic field and a high rotation rate in order to emphasize the influence of these parameters . for this model",
    "we use the equations derived by biermann & cassinelli ( @xcite ) , which do not assume that the magnetic field is radial close to the star .",

    "therefore we expect a strong influence of the magnetic field on nonlinear perturbations as well .",
    "our speculative scenario for waves in the wind of hot stars is the following : waves are predominantly generated close to the star where the stellar radiation field is strong and the sobolev length is short .",
    "waves with a wavelength short compared to the sobolev length are generated predominantly , because they have the shortest amplification timescale . inward running waves",
    "run into the star and disappear because their phase velocity is higher than the unperturbed wind velocity .",
    "outward running waves , which have , for short wavelengths , the same growth timescale than inward running waves , can run over many stellar radii and grow . for the outward running waves @xmath28 and @xmath73 are in phase .",

    "but we can derive some estimates from our calculations .    from fig .",
    "[ f : modb : b].b we see that the phase velocity of the outward running waves and possibly shocks in the rest frame of the star is at least twice the terminal velocity of the unperturbed wind . in the outward running waves the oscillations of @xmath74 and @xmath3 are in phase .",
    "therefore a significant amount of matter , but presumably not all matter will escape at this or a higher velocity , if the outward running waves steepen into forward shocks .",
    "the terminal velocity will then be overestimated at least by a factor of two in the observation . for our model  c",
    "this would be @xmath75 .",
    "krolik & raymond ( @xcite ) found that in a nonmagnetic wind shock shells are running much faster than the phase velocity of the waves . in an unperturbed magnetic wind model such a high value for @xmath2 combined with an reasonable high value for @xmath1",
    "can only be obtained with a very high magnetic field and fast rotation , which leads to a spin down problem .",
    "the influence of our model on @xmath1 is more difficult to estimate .",
    "we gain a real factor on 28 in @xmath1 between our model a&b and model  c even in the unperturbed wind due to the driving force of the rotating magnetic field .",

    "but to calculate the clumping factor @xmath76 at large radii , where radio observations are made , it would be necessary to do a nonlinear calculation including large radii , because the waves steepen into shocks very rapidly due to the short amplification timescales .",

    "magnetic rotator models for hot stars are often criticized for their short spin down times .",
    "we reduced this problem by using the equations of biermann & cassinelli ( @xcite ) for our unperturbed wind model  c. these equations do not assume that the magnetic field is radial close to the star .",
    "therefore we find a smaller value for the alfvnic radius @xmath53 , which controls as a lever arm the angular momentum loss .",
    "the magnetic field increases the angular momentum loss in the equatorial plane compared to a nonmagnetic star with the same rotation rate by @xmath77 , which is 3.2 for our model  c.    in order to decide , wheter the increased angular momentum loss would rule out a rotating magnetic field as an important component of the wind of these stars , one would need a detailed stellar evolution model .",
    "such a model must e.g.consider the angular momentum structure and evolution inside the star , which is yet unknown in the case of a strong magnetic field .",
    "it is also not clear , wheter the magnetic field is present in the wind from the beginning of the stellar evolution , or wheter it is generated later , as was suggested by biermann & cassinelli ( @xcite ) and biermann ( @xcite ) even for stars with convective cores and radiative envelopes .",
    "the angular momentum loss from the wind outside the equatorial plane is also not calculated yet . due to these serious uncertainties in this issue",
    "most people ( including the authors ) use the very simple spin down formula of friend & macgregor ( @xcite , eq .",

    "this formula guesses the angular momentum of the star by assuming , that the star is a _ rigidly _ rotating _ sphere _ of _ constant _ density .",
    "all these three assumptions are of course wrong . the angular momentum loss from outside the equatorial plane is just guessed from the value in the equatorial plane using a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "even if we could accurately calculate the current spin down @xmath80 and mass loss @xmath81 timescales , @xmath82 does not automatically mean that post main sequence star does not rotate significantly .",

    "the outward running waves will also lead to an overestimation of @xmath1 due to wind clumping and the overestimated @xmath2 .",

    "we argued that even for a magnetic field with @xmath88 the spin down time is consistent with the lifetime of the star inferred from the mass loss rate considering the uncertainties in the stellar structure . from the observation of nonthermal radio emission in many ob and wolf - rayet stars we know that these stars have a nonneglible magnetic field .",
    "further direct observations are necessary to infer the actual strength of these fields .",
    "we showed that a luminous fast magnetic rotator model plus wind perturbations by waves or shocks can help to explain the observed high values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 without being ruled out by the spin down problem .",

    "<S> we use a luminous fast magnetic rotator model to analyze the influence of a magnetic field on the linear waves induced in the wind of a massive star by the radiative instability . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a twisted magnetic field can drive a strong wind with a wind efficiency @xmath0 even without multiple scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation amplified waves in the wind are modified by the twisted magnetic field so that they can enhance the wind and lead to overestimates for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we argue that the spin down time might be consistent with the lifetime derived from the mass loss rate within the uncertainties regarding the stellar structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our model may help to explain high , observed values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 without being ruled out by the spin down problem . </S>"
