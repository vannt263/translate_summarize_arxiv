    "the definition of quantum fields on a curved background is an hard task , because of the impossibility to define a unique ( up to unitary equivalence ) hilbert space structure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , equations of motion for such fields can be extended to the curved case and semi - classical tools can be applied at least formally .",
    "this way , the interaction of the gravitation field with quantum degrees of freedom is inferred , in a regime where quantum gravity effects are not yet relevant and a particle - like description is recovered . this coupling may be tested experimentally by studying the trajectories of elementary particles .    here",
    "we address the point whether the interaction between quantum spin and the geometry reflects that of classical spin tensors .",
    "in fact , from the semi - classical limit of spinor fields , we expect a non - trivial coupling between their internal degrees of freedom and the curvature , so that a non - geodesics dynamics is expected .",
    "these deviations with respect to the structure - less case are going to be compared with those ones coming from the papapetrou formulation for spinning particles @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows : at first the papapetrou formulation for classical spinning particles is presented , and then the semi - classical limit of the dirac equation is performed .",
    "papapetrou @xcite performed the classical analysis on the motion of a body in general relativity on a fixed background .    in his formulation ,",
    "the body is described in the space - time as a thin tube inside which there is a non - vanishing energy momentum tensor .",
    "as soon as a curve @xmath0 is identified as the center - of - mass world - line , the multi - pole expansion consists in neglecting all moments of the energy - momentum distribution with respect to @xmath1 from a certain one .    at the lowest order a geodesics dynamics",
    "is found and this is consistent with basic principles of general relativity . at the next order ,",
    "the pole - dipole approximation , a characterization of the body internal structure is given by the spin tensor @xmath2 , whose expression is the following one @xmath3    @xmath4 being the deviation with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the system of equations describing the dynamics is @xmath5    and it outlines that for rotating bodies    a generalized momentum @xmath6 arises and , in general , it is not aligned with the 4-velocity ;    the spin tensor is subjected to a precession around the generalized momentum ;    the trajectory deviates with respect to a geodesics motion , as a consequence of the interaction between the spin tensor and the gravitational field .",
    "however , in the system ( [ pap ] ) there are thirteen unknown quantities and ten equations only .",
    "hence , to provide a solution three conditions must be added . in literature one",
    "finds the following three possible choices , @xmath7 the corinaldesi - papapetrou @xcite , the pirani @xcite and the tulczyjew @xcite consistency conditions , respectively .",
    "all of them expresses the spatial nature of the spin .",
    "the investigation on the coupling between quantum degrees of freedom and gravity requires the extension of the quantum fields formulation to a curved space - time .    as far as spin-@xmath8 particles are concerned",
    ", the dirac algebra must be extended to non - minkowskian spaces .",
    "this can be done by introducing vier - bein vectors @xmath9 and defining dirac matrix as @xmath10 , @xmath11 being those ones of the flat case .",
    "furthermore , generalized derivatives must be defined @xcite , such that the dirac equation in curved space - time reads as @xmath12 @xmath13 $ ] being generators of the lorentz group , while @xmath14 .      the notion of a classical trajectory",
    "is recovered for @xmath18 by a localization along the world - line @xmath19 , which is the integral curve of @xmath20 .",
    "the localization is obtained by assuming a gaussian dependence of the following kind      even though the spread @xmath22 grows during the notion , nevertheless it can be shown that for a reasonable set of initial conditions there exists a macroscopic region where a classical trajectory can be defined @xcite .      in order to make this formulation closer to the papapetrou one",
    ", we are going to perform a spacial integration , taking as space - like coordinates @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ those ones of the space orthogonal to @xmath25 .",
    "the localization here works by allowing us to neglect any term containing first and second derivatives of the gaussian .",
    "furthermore , in agreement with the assumption that any dependence on spatial coordinates has been included into the gaussian , we take for the spinor @xmath26 @xmath27                          we stress that a papapetrou - like interaction between the spin tensor and the riemann tensor comes out . furthermore , being the generalized momentum aligned with the 4-velocity , the conservation of the spin tensor is consistent with a papapetrou - like dynamics ."
