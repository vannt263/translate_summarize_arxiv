    "the atacama b - mode search ( abs ) aims to probe the physics of the early universe through measurements of the cmb polarization anisotropies .",
    "models of inflation predict that a gravitational - wave background existed in the early universe .",
    "such a background would leave its imprint on the cmb in the form of a pseudo - scalar b - mode component in the cmb polarization anisotropies , whereas most other sources of cmb polarization only create vector - like e - modes @xcite . detecting a b - mode component of the cmb anisotropies",
    "is a primary goal of a number of current and upcoming experiments .",
    "the abs experiment is designed for rapid deployment to a high - altitude site in the atacama desert of chile .",
    "the entire experiment will be assembled inside a modified shipping container in north america and shipped to chile ready to rise out of the container roof and observe soon after it arrives .",
    ".experimental parameters for abs [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     abs will observe two 250-square - degree patches around the south galactic pole with @xmath1 beams spread over a @xmath2 instantaneous field of view . to reduce systematic errors , a warm half - wave plate ( hwp ) will modulate the incoming polarization before the radiation enters the beam - forming optics , allowing for better discrimination of atmospheric and instrumental noise sources .",
    "abs is projected to be most sensitive to b - modes in the @xmath3 range , as shown in figure [ sensitivity ] .",
    "cdm cosmology with parameters currently favored by wmap @xcite .",
    "the bottom two solid black curves are the projected bb power spectra for tensor - to - scalar ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 and optical depth @xmath6 .",
    "projected foregrounds include polarized galactic dust ( blue curve ) , estimated from @xcite , and b - modes from lensing ( red curve ) .",
    "estimated binned errors for the ee spectrum and the bb spectrum with @xmath4 are shown as hashed red boxes . ]",
    "the abs receiver is shown in figure [ dewar ] .",
    "the detectors need to be cooled to 300 mk to operate .",
    "in addition , abs will have its primary and secondary mirrors cooled to 4 k to reduce thermal loading on the detectors , provide a cold and stable surface for beam spillover , and eliminate cryogenic lenses . to achieve this ,",
    "the abs cryostat is cooled by two pulse tube cryocoolers , each of which has a 40 k and a 4 k cold head .",
    "cryogenic stages at 1 k and 300 mk are provided by @xmath7he and @xmath8he absorption fridges , respectively .",
    "in addition , the cryogenic system for abs was designed to accommodate two levels of magnetic shielding in addition to the shielding directly around the detectors at the focal plane .",
    "a mu - metal shield at room temperature and a cryoperm shield at 4 k should provide a shielding factor of at least 100 .",
    "abs will use 60-cm mirrors in a compact crossed - dragone configuration @xcite , which allows for both mirrors to be kept inside the cryostat at a temperature of 4 k. in addition , the crossed dragone design was optimized to give good focus and low cross polarization over a large focal plane .",
    "the optical design was initially optimized using codev , a geometric ray - tracing software package .",
    "further analysis was carried out using dadra @xcite , which performs full numerical calculations including diffraction .",
    "the simulated beams on the sky in the center of the abs passband at 145 ghz from dadra are shown in figure [ beams ] .    in order to accomodate a focal plane of 240 feedhorn - coupled detectors , large throughput",
    "input optics are required .",
    "a vacuum window 330 mm in diameter will be made of ultra - high molecular weight polyethylene ( uhmwpe ) anti - reflection coated with expanded ptfe . a warm sapphire half - wave plate ( hwp ) , also 330 mm in diameter ,",
    "will be rotated in front of the vacuum window to modulate the polarization of incoming radiation .",

    ", the receiver will be tilted at approximately 45@xmath9 so that the pulse tubes are vertical . ]    . ]",
    "the 240 abs detectors are grouped into triangular pods bolted into a copper support structure that mechanically supports the pods and conducts heat away .",
    "each abs pod consists of ten feedhorns that are supported by an aluminum interface plate .",
    "the interface plate sets the polarization angle , which is unique for each pod , of each feedhorn and forms part of an overall superconducting magnetic shield , along with an aluminum lid on the back of the pod .",
    "the detector chips are glued on the back of the feedhorns , at the output of a circular section of waveguide .",
    "wirebonds connect the detector chips to a custom flexible / rigid readout circuit that carries the signals to microfabricated chips which house the shunt resistors , nyquist inductors , and the first two stages of multiplexing superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) amplifiers for the pod .",
    "the readout circuit has two rigid triangular pieces bridged by a short flexible section , which allows the circuit to fold over itself in a compact arrangement . a further flexible section on the circuit carries the critical lines from the pod , out a thin slot in the aluminum lid , and to zero insertion force connectors on another board .",
    "from there superconducting wires carry the signals to a squid series array for amplification at 4 k and then on to room temperature .",
    "additional magnetic shielding at 300 mk is provided by 0.5-mm - thick niobium sheets above and below the board containing the squid amplifiers .",
    "the feedhorns for abs were designed with aid from simulations in the conical corrugated horn analysis ( ccorhrn ) program . because of the small dimensions involved , machining restrictions required that the feedhorns be machined in two pieces .",
    "a beam - testing setup has been built to test each feedhorn assembly individually to make sure that it is free of chips or defects . a composite beam map from the first 42 feedhorns is shown in figure [ beam_maps ] .",
    "the beams match theoretical predictions at the level of a few percent .",
    "the abs detectors are fabricated at nist and were designed and tested as part of a collaboration between nist , princeton university , the university of chicago , and the university of colorado at boulder . as shown in figure [ chip ] , each detector consists of a planar ortho - mode transducer ( omt ) that couples the two orthogonal polarizations of light onto separate microstrip lines .",
    "the omt , which has triangular niobium probes suspended on a thin silicon nitride membrane , couples incoming radiation from a corrugated feedhorn through a coplanar - waveguide - to - microstrip transition . after passing through on - chip lowpass filters ,",
    "the microstrip lines terminate in lossy meanders that deposit power onto separate tes bolometers . for more details on detector design and characterization see @xcite . extrapolating data taken from dark tests and assuming a 50% optical efficiency",
    ", the abs detectors should achieve a sensitivity of 300 @xmath0 in the field .",
    "the tes bolometers will be time - domain multiplexed and amplified through three stages of squids , read out by a multi - channel electronics ( mce ) system provided by the university of british columbia .",
    "this will allow for the 240 polarimeters in abs to be read out with a minimum of wiring to room temperature , which is important in reducing thermal loading on the 300 mk stage of the cryogenics .",
    "the abs design and construction is underway and on schedule for deployment in 2010 .",
    "we would like to thank our collaborators in the detector development at the kavli institute for cosmological physics and the university of colorado at boulder .",
    "we also gratefully acknowledge bill dix and glenn atkinson for skillfully machining many parts of the experiment , notably the mirrors and feedhorns , as well as jennifer lin , who designed the feedhorns .",
