    "the aim of this paper is to define and provide sources of examples of stable anti - yetter - drinfeld modules .",
    "they play the role of coefficients for hopf - cyclic theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we claim that modular pairs in involution of connes and moscovici are precisely 1-dimensional stable anti - yetter - drinfeld modules .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is a hopf algebra with a bijective antipode . on the one hand ,",
    "the bijectivity of the antipode is implied by the existence of a modular pair in involution , so that then it need not be assumed . on the other hand , some parts of arguments might work even if the antipode is not bijective .",
    "we avoid such discussions .",
    "the coproduct , counit and antipode of @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . for the coproduct we use the notation @xmath4 , for a left coaction on @xmath5",
    "we write @xmath6 , and for a right coaction @xmath7 .",
    "the summation symbol is suppressed everywhere .",
    "we assume all algebras to be associative , unital and over the same ground field @xmath8 .",
    "the symbol @xmath9 stands for the algebra of polynomial functions on @xmath10 .",

    "all authors are grateful to t.  brzeziski and m.  furuta for their help and comments , and to d.  perrot for the french translation .",
    "it turns out that , in order to incorporate coefficients into cyclic theory , we need to alter the concept of a yetter - drinfeld module by replacing the antipode by its inverse in the yetter - drinfeld compatibility condition between actions and coactions .",
    "we call the modules - comodules satisfying the thus modified yetter - drinfeld compatibility condition _ anti - yetter - drinfeld modules_. just as yetter - drinfeld modules come in 4 different versions depending on the side of actions and coactions ( see @xcite for a general formulation ) , so do the anti - yetter - drinfeld modules .",
    "all versions are completely equivalent and can be derived from one another by replacing a hopf algebra @xmath0 by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "+    [ ayd ] let @xmath0 be a hopf algebra with a bijective antipode @xmath3 , and @xmath5 a module and comodule over @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath5 an anti - yetter - drinfeld module iff the action and coaction are compatible in the following sense : @xmath14       to make cyclic theory work , we also need to assume that the action splits coaction , i.e. , for all @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , for the left - left , left - right , right - left , and right - right versions , respectively .",
    "we call modules satisfying this condition _ stable_. let us emphasize that it is the anti - yetter - drinfeld condition rather than the yetter - drinfeld condition that makes the homomorphism @xmath20 @xmath0-linear and @xmath0-colinear",
    ". therefore the stability condition @xmath21 suits the former and not the latter .",
    "the first class of examples of stable anti - yetter - drinfeld  modules is provided by modular pairs in involution @xcite . since such pairs occur naturally in different contexts , lemma  [ 1dim ] and lemma  [ affine ] guarantee ample amount of examples of anti - yetter - drinfeld  modules .",
    "+    [ 1dim ] let the ground field @xmath8 be a right module over @xmath0 via a character @xmath22 and a left comodule over @xmath0 via a group - like @xmath23 . then @xmath24 is a stable anti - yetter - drinfeld  module _ if and only if _ @xmath25 is a modular pair in involution .",
    "the anti - yetter - drinfeld modules do not form a monoidal category themselves , but rather a so - called @xmath26-category over the category of yetter - drinfeld modules ( see @xcite for details ) . more precisely",
    ": +    [ affine ] let @xmath27 be a yetter - drinfeld module and @xmath5 an anti - yetter - drinfeld   module .",
    "then @xmath28 is an anti - yetter - drinfeld   module via @xmath29 , @xmath30 , for the left - left case , and via @xmath31 , @xmath32 , for the left - right case .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 is an anti - yetter - drinfeld  module via @xmath34 , @xmath35 , for the right - left case , and via @xmath36 , @xmath37 , for the left - right case .",
    "note that , just as the right - right yetter - drinfeld modules are entwined modules @xcite for the entwining @xmath38 , the right - right anti - yetter - drinfeld modules are entwined with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "( other cases are completely analogous . )    an intermediate step between modular pairs in involution and stable anti - yetter - drinfeld modules is given by matched and comatched pairs of @xcite .",
    "whenever the antipode is equal to its inverse , the difference between the yetter - drinfeld and anti - yetter - drinfeld  conditions disappears . for a group ring hopf algebra @xmath40 ,",
    "a left @xmath0-comodule is simply a @xmath41-graded vector space @xmath42 , where the coaction is defined by @xmath43 .",
    "an action of @xmath41 on @xmath5 defines an ( anti-)yetter - drinfeld module if and only if for all @xmath44 and @xmath45 we have @xmath46 .",
    "the stability condition means simply that @xmath47 for all @xmath48 , @xmath45 .",
    "a very concrete classical example of a stable ( anti-)yetter - drinfeld module is provided by the hopf fibration . then @xmath49 and @xmath50 . since @xmath51",
    ", we have a natural left action of @xmath52 on @xmath53 .",
    "its pull - back makes @xmath5 a left @xmath0-comodule . on the other hand",
    ", one can view @xmath53 as the set of all traceless matrices of @xmath52 .",
    "the pull - back of this embedding @xmath54 together with the multiplication in @xmath55 defines a left action of @xmath0 on @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that the equivariance property @xmath56 guarantees the anti - yetter - drinfeld  condition , and this combined with the injectivity of @xmath57 ensures the stability of @xmath5 .",
    "this stability mechanism can be generalized in the following way .",
    "+    let @xmath5 be an algebra and a left @xmath0-comodule .",
    "assume that @xmath58 is an epimorphism of algebras and the action @xmath59 makes @xmath5 an anti - yetter - drinfeld  module .",
    "assume also that @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath5 is a stable module .",
    "another source of examples is provided by hopf - galois theory .",
    "these examples are purely quantum in the sense that the employed actions are automatically trivial for commutative algebras .",
    "to fix the notation and terminology , recall that an algebra and an @xmath0-comodule is called a comodule algebra if the coaction is an algebra homomorphism .",
    "an @xmath0-extension @xmath61 is called hopf - galois iff the canonical map @xmath62 , @xmath63 , is bijective .",
    "the bijectivity assumption allows us to define the translation map @xmath64 , @xmath65}\\otimes_bh^{[2]}$ ] ( summation suppressed ) .",
    "it can be shown that when everything is over a field ( our standing assumption ) , the centralizer @xmath66 of @xmath67 in @xmath68 is a subcomodule of @xmath68 .",
    "on the other hand , the formula @xmath69}ph^{[2]}$ ] defines a right action on @xmath70 called the miyashita - ulbrich action .",
    "this action and coaction satisfy the yetter - drinfeld compatibility condition ( * ? ? ? * ( 3.11 ) ) .",
    "the following proposition modifies the miyashita - ulbrich action so as to obtain stable anti - yetter - drinfeld modules .",
    "+    [ mu ] let @xmath71 be a hopf - galois @xmath0-extension such that @xmath67 is central in @xmath68 . then @xmath68 is a right - right stable anti - yetter - drinfeld  module via the action @xmath72}p(s^{-1}(h))^{[1 ] } $ ] and the right coaction on @xmath68 .",
    "the simplest examples are obtained for @xmath73 .",
    "a broader class is given by the so - called galois objects @xcite",
    ". then quantum - group coverings at roots of unity provide examples with central coinvariants bigger than the ground field ( see @xcite and examples therein ) .",
    "finally , one can generalize proposition  [ mu ] to arbitrary hopf - galois extensions by replacing @xmath68 by @xmath74 $ ] ( * ? ? ? * remark  4.2 ) .",
    "for finite - dimensional hopf algebras , the yetter - drinfeld modules can be understood as modules over the drinfeld double @xcite .",
    "much in the same way , the anti - yetter - drinfeld modules can also be understood as modules over a certain algebra .",
    "this makes the usual notions and operations for modules , like projectivity or induction , directly available for anti - yetter - drinfeld modules . to this end",
    ", the comodule structure of an anti - yetter - drinfeld module has to be converted into a module structure over the dual hopf algebra  @xmath75 , so that from now on we assume that the hopf algebra  @xmath0 is finite - dimensional .",
    "+        note that the above product differs from the product in the drinfeld double of  @xmath0 @xcite only by the additional squared antipode in the second factor .",
    "to relate the modules over  @xmath79 with anti - yetter - drinfeld modules , recall first that every right @xmath0-comodule  @xmath5 becomes a left @xmath75-module via @xmath80 .",
    "conversely , any left @xmath75-module yields a right @xmath0-comodule via @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is a basis of  @xmath0 and @xmath83 is the dual basis .",
    "( of course , this comodule structure does not depend on the choice of a basis . ) using this , we get the following connection between the modules over  @xmath79 and anti - yetter - drinfeld modules : +    let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional hopf algebra .",

    "here @xmath82 is a basis of  @xmath0 and @xmath83 its dual basis .",
    "the claim of lemma  [ affine ] is reflected in the fact that although @xmath79 is not a hopf algebra itself , it can be shown that the formula @xmath87 makes @xmath79 a right comodule algebra over the drinfeld double  @xmath88 .",
