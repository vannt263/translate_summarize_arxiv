    "in the case of the kauffman polynomial bound , the equivalent condition was conjectured by fuchs in @xcite , and is precisely the existence of an ( ungraded ) ruling of a front diagram for @xmath4 .",

    "can distinguish knots with identical classical invariants .",
    "on the contrary , our result shows that in the ungraded case the complete ruling invariant is given by certain coefficients of @xmath17 depending only on @xmath6 , hence depends only on topological knot type and classical invariants ( as conjectured in @xcite ) . for knots ,",
    "the 2-graded ruling invariant is realized in coefficients of the homfly polynomial .",
    "together these results clarify the relationship between these two upper bounds in an interesting way .",
