    "the development of waveguide optical amplifiers based on rare earth ( re ) doped silicon based matrix is of great interest for the semiconductor research community@xcite .",
    "erbium ions are particularly interesting due to an optical transition at @xmath9 which coincides with the maximum of transmission in optical glass fiber@xcite . however , in the case of erbium this transition involves the ground level , which may limit the achievable gain due to reabsorption mechanisms@xcite . to overcome this critical issue , neodymium ion has been recently proposed because its emission scheme makes it more suitable for achieving higher gain@xcite . in such a system , the amplification is commonly achieved through re level population inversion by an appropriate optical pumping .",
    "one main drawback of re ions is their low absorption cross section .",
    "however this can be overcome by the use of sensitizers that are characterized by a larger absorption cross section .",
    "those sensitizers have shown an efficient transfer of energy to re ions in their vicinity .",
    "several sensitizers of re have been proposed in literature .",
    "et al _ @xcite shows the sensitization of @xmath1ions by different kinds of sensitizers such as ytterbium ions , metal ions and silicon nanograins ( si - ng ) .",
    "the work of macdonald _ et al _ @xcite presents the sensitization of @xmath0ions by si - ng .",
    "in this paper we present a comparative study of waveguides with an active layer containing si - ng and doped either with erbium or neodymium ions .",
    "the typical composition and structure of such waveguides is presented in section [ description waveguide ] .",
    "the electromagnetic field and level populations of si - ng and re ions have been computed using an algorithm published in a previous paper @xcite and briefly detailed in section [ calculation method ] .    in section [ rare earth ] , we describe levels populations equations associated with si - ng , erbium ions and neodymium ions . for the two re ions , due to their different transition time properties , two particular ways of calculation will be detailed . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present for both re population inversions , population map and optical gain as a function of optical pump power .",
    "we conclude by the comparison of the optical gain of two waveguides doped either with erbium or neodymium ions as a function of the pump power .      or @xmath1ions.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the waveguide is composed of three layers ( fig .",
    "[ waveguide ] ) .",
    "the bottom cladding layer is composed of pure silica . in order to ensure optical confinement of modes , this layer is about 5 to 8 @xmath10 m thick in a typical experimental waveguide doped either with @xmath0ions @xcite or @xmath1ions @xcite . in this modeling method",
    "the thickness of bottom cladding layer was taken equal to @xmath11 in order to limit the use of memory .",
    "the @xmath12 active layer constituted of silicon rich silicon oxide ( srso ) contains si - ng and re ions .",
    "a pure silica strip layer is stacked on the top of the srso layer . the static refractive index (",
    "_ i.e. _ refractive index which remains constant with wavelength ) of the active layer ( @xmath13 ) has been chosen greater than the one of the strip and bottom cladding layers ( @xmath14 ) to ensure the guiding conditions .    in order to investigate which is the most suitable re between @xmath0and @xmath1for achieving high gain ,",
    "both waveguides are pumped continuously ( cw ) by the propagation in the active layer of a pump mode at 488 nm .",
    "a signal mode is co - propagated in the active layer in order to investigate the achievability of amplification by stimulated emission .",
    "this signal corresponds to a transition occurring between electronics levels of re , either at 1532 nm for erbium ions or at 1064 nm for neodymium ions@xcite .",
    "the waveguide dimensions are identical for erbium or neodymium ions and according to the experimental conditions we propagate the fundamental transverse electric mode ( @xmath15 ) for the pump and signal along z direction .",
    "the calculation and the injection of mode profiles in ade - fdtd method for all wavelengths considered here are described in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic fields ( @xmath16 ) and poynting vector ( @xmath17 ) as well as re and si - ng populations in steady state are computed by the algorithm described by fafin et al@xcite .",
    "this algorithm is based on finite - difference time - domain method ( fdtd ) and auxiliary differential equations ( ade ) .",
    "the fdtd method consists in the discretization in time and space of the electromagnetic fields@xcite according to the k. yee algorithm@xcite .",
    "the ade makes the link between electromagnetic fields and absorption and emission processes by the use of a set of polarisation densities @xmath18 following a lorentz electronic oscillator model@xcite . a typical polarisation equation ( eq .",
    "( [ polarisation ] ) ) between two level populations @xmath19 and @xmath20 is described below : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transition linewidth including radiative , non - radiative and de - phasing processes@xcite , and @xmath23 is the resonance frequency of this transition .",
    "@xmath24 used in @xcite depends on the transition lifetime @xmath25 and on the optical index n.    the time evolution of levels populations for each emitter ( re , si - ng ) is described by a rate equation which depends on polarisation densities of considered transitions , lifetimes , transfer coefficient and levels populations . since in visible wavelength range",
    ", the electromagnetic field has a characteristic time of the order of @xmath26 s and the levels populations of emitters have characteristic lifetimes as long as a few milliseconds @xcite , a classical ade - fdtd calculation is impossible in a reasonable time@xcite .",
    "indeed with the classical ade - fdtd method the equations of populations are calculated simultaneously with the electromagnetic field leading to about @xmath27 iterations .",
    "we have recently overcome this multiscale issue @xcite after splitting the classical ade - fdtd single loop into two interconnected loops separating short time and long time processes .",
    "the electromagnetic fields and polarisation densities are calculated in the short time loop and the rate equations in the long time one .",
    "this method allows us to reduce drastically the number of iterations from @xmath27 to @xmath28 and consequently reduces the calculation time to more reasonable duration ( 7 days for the present waveguide at bi - processors quad - core intel nehalem ep @ 2.8 ghz ) .",
    "moreover , in order to minimize phase velocity error and velocity anisotropy errors inherent to the fdtd method , the algorithm was set up with the time and space steps introduced in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the excitation mechanism of the erbium and neodymium ions and the numerical calculation of the levels populations at the steady state .           we model silicon nanograins ( si - ng ) as a two levels system ( fig .",
    "[ schema excitation ] ) where the ground and excited levels populations ( respectively @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are given by the rate equations eq .",

    ", we assume the excitation of one single exciton by si - ng , therefore the si - ng population will correspond to the exciton population .",
    "after non - radiative transitions in the conduction band , the exciton may either radiatively recombine or excite an emitter in its vicinity .",
    "this energy transfer may occur if the energy gap between conduction and valence band of si - ng matches the energy gap between the re fundamental level and an upper level leading to a possible emission . according to literature @xcite the lifetime of excited level @xmath30",
    "is chosen at @xmath31 . since few papers studied the energy transfer coefficient in si - ng and erbium ions @xcite and to our knowledge",
    "no study was made on this coefficient in si - ng and neodymium , this energy transfer coefficient between si - ng and both re is assumed identical and taken equal to @xmath32 .",
    "we took the same concentration of si - ng equal to @xmath33 for both active layers doped either with @xmath1or @xmath0ions . in order to simulate a realistic absorption and emission cross section equal to @xmath34 the linewidth @xmath22 and the number of polarizations @xmath35",

    "consequently , the preferred method would be an analytical calculation of populations by setting @xmath39 .",
    "however , this is only applicable in case of neodymium levels equations .",
    "moreover , the up - conversion term in erbium rate equations leads to equations that are hardly analytically solvable . in that case",
    ", the steady states of population levels are reached by a finite difference method .",
    "this calculation was possible using a reasonable time step of @xmath40 ten times lower than the shortest lifetime ( @xmath41 ) considered in this model .",

    "this interaction is governed by the transfer coefficient k , which is the same for both re , but also by specific transitions lifetimes of each re .",
    "the larger population inversion observed for erbium than with neodymium is consequently due to the difference of lifetimes between these re ( table [ erbium parameters ] and [ neodymium parameters ] ) .",

    "the three categories of commercially available optical amplifier on c - band ( edfa , edwa and soa ) present a gain level about 20 to 25 db with a working length ranging from cm to few meters for edfa and for a power consumption mainly dedicated to optical or electrical pumping of about few watts @xcite . since we found a low gain and a short length of positive population inversion by modeling of @xmath1doped based waveguide on the broad range of pump power .",
