    "even though all the weak bi - doublets @xmath177 contained in the @xmath33 submultiplets @xmath178 of @xmath179 have gut scale masses , it is necessary to clarify how their induced vevs contribute to the dirac masses of all fermions in a manner analogous to minimal susy @xmath1 @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we clarify how by keeping only the desired minimal number of particles below the gut scale , vev of different weak bi - doublets are made available to generate fermion masses withot disrupting gauge coupling unification .    the added @xmath180 doublet fields @xmath181 will have a new contributions to the superpotential which include ,    w_h= m_^t_d + + _1^t_d _ d+ ( _2^t_d + _3)h_d ........ where ellipses denote couplings to other higgs representations and subscript d stands to indicate a @xmath180doublet .",
    "since @xmath182 and we need no fine - tuning of parameters @xmath183 to maintain gauge hierarchy , it immediately follows that all the components of the @xmath180 doublet pair ( including the weak bi - doublets and triplets ) acquire masses at the gut scale and they do not upset gauge coupling unification . denoting the full superpotential as @xmath184 ,",
    "the @xmath185term due to @xmath186 now contributes the following terms to the scalar potential , v&=&(_2_0 + _ 3)h_0_0_0 + & & + ( _2^t_d + _3)h_d_0_0 .",
    "[ induced ] this has the implication that whenever the rh - triplets in @xmath187 and the weak doublet in @xmath188-singlet @xmath189 aquire vevs @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively , where the latter is approximately of the order of the weak scale , the weak doublets in @xmath192 gets an induced vev . on the otherhand , in addition to @xmath190 , the vevs of the @xmath193 doublet components @xmath194",
    "generate induced vevs in the weak doublets in @xmath195 .",
    "the order of magnitudes of all the three induced vevs can now be expressed as , ^_i= v_r^2m_u^2_iy_i , ( i=0,1,2).[qivev ] where , as defined subsequently in this section , @xmath196 stands for the product of @xmath197 vev and the respective yukawa coupling @xmath198 .",
    "one major difference from the minimal susy @xmath1 is that in addition to the vevs of up- and down type doublets of @xmath199 , the vevs of nontrivial @xmath200 representations also enter into the rhs of eq.([qivev ] ) .",
    "the next point that needs explanation is how only the six bi - doublets lighter than @xmath43 acquire nearly electroweak - scale vevs while five of them have masses near @xmath47 scale and only the remaining bi - double has mass near the electro - weak scale to supply the up - type and the down - type mssm doublets ( @xmath201 ) .    in order to achieve this objective",
    "we introduce two @xmath1-singlet scalar fields , @xmath202 and @xmath203 which transform as doublet and triplet , respectively , under @xmath29 .",
    "these will make additional contribution to the superpotential ,    w_h= _",
    "s_s h_0h_d + _s_s h_0h_t + ....    we assign order @xmath47 scale vevs to @xmath202 and @xmath203 to break the @xmath29 symmetry at the intermediate scale and generate @xmath204 and @xmath205 mixings .",
    "then using bi - unitary transformation on the six doublet fielda to diagonalize the bi - doublet mass matrix at the intermediate scale , we treat only one linear combinations of the weak bi - doublets to have mass at the electro - weak scale while the remaining five linear combinations are treated to acquire mass at the intermediate scale .",
    "this would involve only one fine - tuning of the new parameters of the superpotential .",
    "once the lightest linear combination of all the six bi - doublets is constructed in this manner to supply the mssm higgs doublets ( @xmath201 ) , the electroweak vevs of the latter imply vevs of approximately the same order for all the bi - doublet components in @xmath206 .",
    "then the induced vevs of weak bi - doublets at the gut - scale contained in @xmath207 , already discussed in eq.([qivev ] ) follow in a straight - forward manner .    to have a rough idea of the order of the vevs involved , using eq.([qivev ] ) and taking the respective yukawa couplings in the range @xmath208 and @xmath209 gev , @xmath210 gev to @xmath19 gev , @xmath211 gev",

    "although @xmath213 gev has been assumed with a view to obtain the right - handed neutrino mass @xmath214 gev for @xmath93 , we note that it is difficult to visualise any such value of @xmath190 substantially lower than the gut - scale in a single - step breaking scenario ; hence the desired value of @xmath47 is not obtainable without adjusting the value of the majorana coupling to @xmath215 .",
