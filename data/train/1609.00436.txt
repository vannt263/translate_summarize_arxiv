    "non - self - adjoint schrdinger operators can appear in a variety of settings .",
    "these settings can range physical problems to purely mathematical ones .",
    "such examples include the study of the ginzburg - landau equation in superconductivity @xcite , @xcite , the orr - somerfeld operator in fluid dynamics @xcite , @xcite , the theory of scattering resonances @xcite , or non - self - adjoint perturbations of self - adjoint operators @xcite . in the self - adjoint case",
    ", the spectral theorem provides a powerful tool to control the resolvent of schrdinger operators . however , there is no suitable analog to this for non - self - adjoint operators .    in this paper , we study semiclassical non - self - adjoint differential operators , and are thus concerned with the behavior of the resolvent as the semiclassical parameter @xmath0 tends towards @xmath1 .",
    "the general difficulty is that for non - self - adjoint semiclassical operators the spectrum does not control the resolvent , which may become very large far away from the spectrum as @xmath2 . by a theorem of davies @xcite and dencker , sjstrand , and zworski @xcite , for a non - self - adjoint semiclassical schrdinger operator of the form @xmath3 , for @xmath4 , and any @xmath5 of the form @xmath6",
    "where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath5 is an  almost eigenvalue \" of @xmath9 , in the sense that there exists a family of functions @xmath10 for which @xmath11 .",
    "thus , when @xmath12 we should not generally expect to have much control over the resolvent of such an operator in the interior of the right half - plane .",
    "so instead we will study resolvent estimates of such operators when the spectral parameter @xmath5 is near the boundary of this region .    in this paper",
    "we show that for a broad class of non - self - adjoint semiclassical schrdinger operators there is an unbounded parabolic region near the imaginary axis where the resolvent is well controlled .",
    "let us now introduce the precise assumptions on our operators .",
    "let @xmath13 be such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 with @xmath16 real valued and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "we place the following conditions on the potential @xmath20 : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 here , and throughout the paper , we use the notation `` @xmath24 '' to denote that there exists a constant @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .",
    "we define the weyl quantization of a symbol @xmath27 by @xmath28 and the semiclassical weyl quantization by @xmath29 where @xmath30 . note that @xmath31 we first prove the following a priori estimate for this operator .",

[ thm2 ] for @xmath32 as above , @xmath9 , the @xmath45-graph closure of @xmath46 on @xmath47 is the maximal realization of @xmath46 equipped with the domain @xmath48 . for @xmath49 , @xmath0 and @xmath5 as above",

    "similar resolvent estimates have been attained for different classes of semiclassical non - self - adjoint operators .",
    "herau , sjstrand , and stolk proved a similar resolvent estimate for the kramers - fokker - planck operator under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "we use a multiplier method inspired by one used in @xcite , but our proof proceeds quite differently .",
    "theirs uses the fbi transform in a compact region of phase space and and weyl - hrmander calculus with a suitable metric near infinity , while ours works globally using the wick quantization and some standard weyl calculus .",
    "hitrik and sjstrand attained a similar estimate for certain one - dimensional non - self - adjoint schrdinger operators @xcite , with ellipticity assumptions on the potential .",
    "also , dencker , sjstrand , and zworski showed that for non - self - adjoint semiclassical operators , under suitable assumptions including ellipticity at infinity , the resolvent can be similarly estimated in a small region near a boundary point of the range of the symbol , away from critical values of the symbol @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes our result , in addition to the relatively direct proof , is that we have fairly loose conditions on the potential , with no requirement of ellipticity , and we attain a resolvent estimate for @xmath5 in an unbounded region .    to demonstrate the applicability of this result , here are some examples of cases where it can be used .",
    "let @xmath52 for @xmath53 any quadratic form with @xmath54 .",
    "by diagonalization we can see that @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is constant so we can apply the above theorems to @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",

    "let @xmath65 be given by @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath67 so applying the above to @xmath68 with @xmath69 and any @xmath35 yields , for some @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath70 for all @xmath40 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath62 .    for a broader example we also have the following :    let @xmath73 be a morse function with finitely many critical points that satisfies .",

    "away from critical points and @xmath88 , @xmath89 is bounded below away from 0 and @xmath90 is bounded above , so @xmath63 here as well .",

    "we will construct a bounded weight function @xmath96 to be used in proving theorem [ thm1 ] . then in section 3 we will provide a brief overview of the wick quantization . in section 4",
    "we prove theorem [ thm1 ] by using the weight function as a bounded multiplier to prove an estimate for the wick quantization of @xmath32 and use the relationship between the wick and weyl quantizations as well as some weyl symbol calculus to get the desired estimate . in section 5",
