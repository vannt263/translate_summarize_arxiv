    "the number density of these heavily obscured agns is estimated to be of the same order as that of moderately obscured agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "compared to the above methods , which utilize observational data directly and determine the selection criteria empirically , @xcite adopted a generally different approach to find obscured agns .",
    "they selected candidates with significantly higher ir - based ( also including the component corresponding to the transmitted uv emission ; see  2.1 below for details ) star formation rates ( sfrs ) than their uv - based ( after correcting for dust extinction ) sfrs .",
    "the amount of excess in the ir - based sfr is a measurement of the excess in the ir emission , which is likely caused by reprocessed emission from the dusty torus of a heavily obscured agn .",
    "this relative ir sfr excess ( isx ) selection method requires and utilizes redshift information to measure the ir excess effectively , and it appears to isolate a different ir sample from the methods above @xcite .",
    "a few of the candidates in @xcite have been reliably identified as ct agns @xcite .",
    "the isx sample is also contaminated by star - forming galaxies due to uncertainties in the calculation of sfrs ; the heavily obscured agn fraction in the @xcite sample is estimated to be @xmath16 @xcite , and the rest of the objects are likely star - forming galaxies .    in this paper ,",

    "the net source counts are then given by @xmath106 , and the s / n is @xmath107 ; we note that the numbers of source and background counts are large ( @xmath108 ) , and thus the s / n can be calculated using gaussian statistics .",
    "the 3-diameter aperture does not encircle the full point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "thus we determined an encircled - energy fraction ( eef ) for each source in each band by interpolating an eef table given the aperture radius , angle , and photon energy .",
    "the eef table was derived from the psf images of the sources in the 4  ms cdf - s generated by acis extract ( ae ; @xcite ) that uses the marx ray - trace simulator ; psf images at five different photon energies ( @xmath1098.5 kev ) for each source in each _ chandra _  observation were provided by ae ( see  3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we created the eef table by calculating the eefs at different aperture radii , off - axis angles , and photon energies , averaged over all the observations weighted by exposure time .",
    "the eefs calculated this way are the best representative of the real cdf - s data .",

    "x - ray sources with very flat spectral slopes ( @xmath118 ) are almost exclusively identified as heavily obscured agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus a significant contribution from obscured agns is required to produce this kind of hard x - ray signal for the isx sample .",
    "we note that the isn sample may still contain a fraction of low - luminosity agns with soft spectra comparable to those of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these agns are generally unobscured and are not of primary interest to this study . in figure  3 , we show the adaptively smoothed stacked images for the isx and isn samples .",
    "it is clear that the isx sample has a much harder x - ray signal than the isn sample .",
    "the difference between the isx and isn samples is also apparent via comparison of their fluxes ; the isx sb flux is @xmath119 smaller than the isn sb flux , while the isx hb flux is @xmath14 times higher than the isn hb flux .",
    "the stacked x - ray signal ( @xmath120 ) for the isx sample indicates the existence of embedded agns and is consistent with x - ray emission from heavily obscured or ct agns modeled with a reflection spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a spectrum from a toroidal reprocessor @xcite .",
    "however , we can not derive the average agn properties using the stacked signal directly , as the isx sources have a range of redshifts and the sample is likely contaminated by star - forming galaxies ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ f01 ] ) .",
    "we thus performed monte carlo simulations to assess the fraction of heavily obscured agns / ct agns in the sample , using a procedure refined from that discussed in @xcite . for a given agn fraction , we ran 10000 simulations to estimate the expected x - ray emission from both the star - forming and agn activities of the sample , and we then compared the average simulated results to the observed stacked signal .",
    "we first used the isn sample ( 58 star - forming galaxies ) to test our simulation method .",
    "for galaxies , a number of studies have found an approximately linear correlation between the sfr and rest - frame 210 kev x - ray luminosity @xmath121 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , later studies have pointed out that the x - ray ",
    "sfr correlation is likely to have significant scatter due to the fact that sfr only relates to the population of relatively young high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , and the older population of x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) likely relates to the galaxy stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we assumed an x - ray power - law photon index of @xmath129 ( given the stacking results ) and no intrinsic absorption for the star - forming galaxies , and then converted the predicted 210 kev x - ray luminosity to the observed sb and hb fluxes using the individual redshifts of the sources .",
    "as none of the isn sources is individually x - ray detected , we required that the simulated fluxes in the sb and hb of each source do not exceed the sensitivity limits at the source position .",
    "the x - ray sensitivity limits are derived following @xcite , by calculating the minimum flux at each pixel ( converted from the minimum number of counts ) required for detection under the catalog source - detection criteria .",
    "we added a small gaussian dispersion of 0.1 dex to the sensitivity limits to account for statistical fluctuations ( estimated using the few cdf - s x - ray sources with fluxes below the nominal sensitivity limits ) .",
    "if the simulated x - ray fluxes are greater than the sensitivity limits , we made another random generation of the source properties ( in this case , only eq .",

    "we performed 10000 simulations , and the average numbers of output counts are @xmath130 for the sb and @xmath131 for the hb ( the errors are the standard errors of the mean ; the 1  @xmath17 dispersions for the average numbers of counts are both @xmath132 ) , matching well with the observed stacked counts ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 )",
    ". therefore we can successfully reproduce the x - ray emission from star - forming activity with this simulation approach .",
    "we then performed simulations for the 23 sources in the isx sample adopting a similar approach , calculating x - ray emission from both the star - forming and agn activities of the sample . assuming an agn fraction in the range of @xmath4690% , the x - ray emission from the star - forming galaxies in the sample was derived following the same procedure as above .    for a source selected as an agn , its x - ray emission and ir emission consist of both a star - formation component ( host galaxy ) and an agn component",
    "for the star - formation component , we estimated its ir - based sfr to be @xmath135 , where the factor @xmath136 is randomly drawn from a gaussian function with @xmath96 ( blue histogram in fig .  [ f01 ] ) to account for the scatter of the calculated sfr .",
    "the intrinsic sfr of the star - formation component was then estimated as @xmath137/2 $ ] , and the corresponding x - ray emission was calculated . for the agn component , the intrinsic 210 kev luminosity , @xmath138 , can be estimated from the rest - frame 6  @xmath32 m luminosity of the agn , @xmath139 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the relation in @xcite was derived using a sample of local agns with the 6 @xmath32 m agn continua decomposed from the ir spectra .",
    "here we used the luminosity - dependent version of the relation which takes into account the possible luminosity dependence @xcite , @xmath140 a gaussian dispersion of 0.4 dex was added to account for the scatter of the relation , estimated based on the range of intrinsic x - ray - to - mid - ir luminosity ratios for local agns @xcite .",
    "we note that this relation is consistent with the x - ray - to - mid - ir luminosity ratios of a sample of x - ray selected obscured quasars ( sturm et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that it is applicable for deriving the intrinsic luminosity of heavily obscured or ct agns . to derive the rest - frame 6  @xmath32 m monochromatic luminosity coming from the agn , we first computed the agn 24  @xmath32 m flux by subtracting the star - formation contribution from the observed 24  @xmath32 m flux ; the star - formation contribution to the 24  @xmath32 m flux was estimated using the ir - based sfr ( @xmath141 ) above and the @xcite ir sed templates .",
    "the residual 24  @xmath32 m flux was then converted to the rest - frame 6  @xmath32 m flux using the ir sed of the local ct agn ngc  1068 ( sed data from @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the observed 24  @xmath32 m wavelength corresponds to rest - frame 1216  @xmath32 m for our sources , and the conversion factor to the rest - frame 6  @xmath32 m flux is @xmath1420.3 .",
    "we adopted an intrinsic photon index of @xmath100 for the agn and an @xmath101 value randomly drawn from the @xmath101 distribution shown in figure  7 of @xcite , in which about half of the agns are ct .",
    "the adopted @xmath101 distribution has only a small impact on the final @xmath101 distribution , as will be discussed later .",
    "given the intrinsic 210 kev luminosity , absorption , and photon index , we estimated the observed absorbed sb and hb fluxes using the mytorus model @xcite implemented in xspec .",
    "the mytorus model is a recently developed spectral - fitting suite for modeling the transmitted and scattered x - ray spectra from a toroidal - shaped reprocessor , and it is especially designed to treat the spectra of ct agns . compared to the commonly used disk - reflection model for ct agns ( e.g. , the _ pexrav _ model in xspec ; see @xcite ) , the mytorus model is more physically motivated and takes into account absorption and scattering simultaneously .",
    "we only considered the continuum output from mytorus for simplicity , neglecting the fluorescent iron emission lines which contribute less than 8% of the hb continuum flux .",
    "two basic parameters describing the geometry of the model are the angle of the torus and the inclination angle ( 0   corresponds to a face - on observing angle ) .",
    "the angle was set at 37 , corresponding to a scenario where the number of obscured agns is four times the number of unobscured agns ; such an obscured agn fraction ( @xmath6 ) for moderate - luminosity agns at @xmath34 has been reported in several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we randomly chose an inclination angle between 37  and 90  ( probability weighted by solid angle ) for each source .",
    "other parameters , such as the relative cross - normalizations of different components , were set at the default values ( see  8.2 of the mytorus manual ) .",
    "the @xmath101 value in the mytorus model has an upper limit of @xmath143  @xmath1 . for column densities beyond this limit ,",
    "the observed spectrum is highly geometry dependent , and the scattered flux is likely dominated by scattering in any optically thin parts of the torus , even if the effective solid angle of the optically thin gas is tiny ( t. yaqoob and k. d. murphy 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "the above parameterization of the model can not reproduce the exact environment of real obscured agns , which could be much more complicated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we consider it to be the best available approximation of the average properties .",
    "we then combined the emission emerging from this obscured agn component with that from the star - formation component to derive the expected observed emission .",
    "as for the simulations of star - forming galaxies , we required that the observed sb and hb fluxes do not exceed the sensitivity limits at the source position .",
    "we would continue randomly regenerating the source properties ( e.g. , @xmath101 value ) until this requirement is satisfied .",
    "this is a strong constraint on the simulated source properties , and it generally requires the agn to be heavily obscured or ct . finally , we converted the fluxes into counts in the extraction aperture , and added the sb and hb counts from every source as the output of a single simulation .",
    "we again performed 10000 simulations , and the average output counts were compared to the stacking results in table  2 .",
    "the simulation results are shown in figure  4 , with the simulated sb and hb counts at different assumed agn fractions .",
    "as the agn fraction increases , the band ratio also increases and the simulated spectrum becomes harder .",
    "we note that the simulated sb photons almost exclusively originate from star - forming galaxies and agn hosts ( their star - formation components ) , while the hb photons are mainly from the agns ; the increase of band ratio with agn fraction is largely due to the increase in the hb counts .",
    "however , we did not include a soft - scattering component in the spectra of heavily obscured agns , which has been observed to provide significant sb emission in most of the local ct agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the normalization of this component to the intrinsic power - law continuum is around 1% but has large object - to - object variations and uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resulting contribution to the sb emission relative to the host - galaxy contribution depends on both this normalization and the intrinsic x - ray luminosity . therefore the sb simulated counts should be considered lower limits , and we use only the hb results to determine the agn fraction . as shown in figure  4 , an agn fraction of @xmath4 can produce the observed hb counts ( see table  3 ) .",
    "star - forming galaxies can still host low - luminosity agns , as long as the agn x - ray luminosities are not comparable to their host galaxies ; this kind of agns is not the focus of this study . ]",
    "the error on the agn fraction was determined given the error on the observed hb counts .",
    "the @xmath144 agn fraction is in good agreement with the fraction of extra sources ( 73% , shaded area ) in the @xmath94 distribution plot in figure  2 . for this best - fit agn fraction",
    ", we also computed the stacked and simulated signals in several sub - bands , and the comparisons are shown in table  3 .",
    "the simulations reproduced well the stacked counts in general .",
    "the cumulative @xmath101 distribution for the 75% of agns in the 10000 simulations is displayed as an inset of figure  4 , where @xmath5 of the agns are heavily obscured , and @xmath6 are ct .",
    "the ct agn fraction in the entire isx sample is thus @xmath23 .",
    "the isx agns have moderate x - ray luminosities . the median intrinsic 210  kev luminosity derived from the simulations is @xmath145  erg  s@xmath10 ; this value would be @xmath24 higher if the intrinsic luminosity was calculated ( equation 6 ) using the observed ir flux ( without subtracting the star - formation contribution ) .",
    "the interquartile range of the x - ray luminosities is ( 0.94)@xmath146  erg  s@xmath10  [ ( 15)@xmath146  erg  s@xmath10 ] for the heavily obscured ( ct ) agns .",
    "we explored how the agn fraction could change by varying some of the assumptions in the simulations .",
    "first , we tried the commonly used disk - reflection model instead of the mytorus model to compute obscured agn emission .",
    "an absorbed power - law ( _ zwabs*zpow _ in xspec ) plus reflection ( _ pexrav _ in xspec ) model was used .",
    "the absorbed power - law component typically dominates in the compton - thin ( @xmath148  @xmath1 ) regime , and the reflection component dominates in the ct regime .",
    "we note that the _ pexrav _ model has non - negligible uncertainties on some of its parameters , such as the reflection scaling factor . for simplicity",
    ", we adopted the same parameters used in @xcite to model the xrb ; we assumed a cut - off energy of 200 kev , a reflection scaling factor of 0.37 , and an inclination angle of 60  for the reflecting material .",
    "the hard x - ray flux produced with this model is about three times higher than that from the mytorus model @xcite , and thus the required agn fraction in the isx sample is smaller .",
    "the fraction drops from @xmath4 to @xmath149 , still indicating a substantial agn contribution .",
    "again , almost all ( @xmath5 ) of the agns are heavily obscured .",
    "simply increasing the @xmath138-to-@xmath139 ratio in equation  [ irlxagn ] also reduces the agn fraction .",
    "for example , if we adopt the relation used in @xcite , which gives an x - ray luminosity that is @xmath142 dex more luminous than ours , the resulting agn fraction is @xmath150",
    ". the initial @xmath101 distribution input into the simulation will affect the agn fraction slightly .",
    "we adopted an alternative initial @xmath101 distribution that has only @xmath151 ct agns , which is similar to the @xmath101 distribution for high excitation - line galaxies in @xcite .",
    "the derived agn fraction is @xmath152 with @xmath153 being ct .",
    "the ct agn fraction in the entire isx sample ( @xmath154 ) is thus comparable to that ( @xmath23 ) for the best - fit result above . even in an extreme case where the initial @xmath101 distribution has only 10% ct agns , an agn fraction of @xmath23 and a ct agn fraction of @xmath154",
    "are still required to produce the stacked x - ray emission and satisfy the requirement that the simulated sources can not be individually detected in the sb or hb .",
    "we note that the adopted photon index for star - forming galaxies ( @xmath129 ) has little effect on the estimated agn fraction as these galaxies produce mainly sb counts and we do not consider sb counts to be constraining .    in general , the requirement that the simulated sources can not be individually detected places a strong constraint on the final results , and an agn fraction of @xmath155 ( mostly heavily obscured ) is always expected .",
    "we also caution that the simulation results were taken to be the average of 10000 tests , and thus they ( as well as the following analyses based on these results ) only represent the most probable scenario of the isx source properties and might deviate from the real source properties .",
    "we consider that this is the best available approach to probe the nature of isx sources given the x - ray and multiwavelength data available .",
    "given the simulation results for the isx sample , we can estimate the space density of heavily obscured agns at @xmath21 and calculate their contribution to the xrb at high energies ( 1030 kev ) .",
    "there are @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) heavily obscured ( ct ) agns expected in the stacking isx sample .",
    "these objects are located within the central 6-radius region of the cdf - s ; the corresponding area is 0.029  deg@xmath158 after excluding the regions masked by x - ray sources .",
    "we further correct the number of sources by 10% to account for the fraction removed due to blended 24 @xmath32 m photometry .",
    "therefore the sky density of heavily obscured ( ct ) agns in our isx sample is @xmath159  deg@xmath20 ( @xmath160  deg@xmath20);1 x - ray agns from the original 5237 galaxies in the same region for the 4  ms cdf - s is @xmath161  deg@xmath20 . ] the corresponding space density is @xmath162  mpc@xmath12 [ @xmath11  mpc@xmath12 ] given the comoving volume between redshift 0.5 and 1 .",
    "note that there are several factors affecting the estimated space density above .",
    "the expected number of agns in the isx sample may be up to @xmath164 lower if different assumptions are made in the simulations (  3.2 ) , and thus the space density will be reduced by the same fraction . on the other hand ,",
    "there is probably a small fraction of sources excluded from the parent sample with stellar mass @xmath165 (  2.2 ) that also host heavily obscured agns .",
    "also , the stacking isx sample was selected in a relatively small area , and thus we have missed a few rare but intrinsically luminous agns , which is also suggested by the moderate ir luminosities of all the isx sources in table 1 . moreover ,",
    "the x - ray spectra of heavily ct ( @xmath166  @xmath1 ) agns can not be modeled by mytorus and an upper limit of @xmath143  @xmath1 was used for the column density ; if these heavily ct agns are present in the isx sample , we could have overestimated their x - ray emission and thus underestimated the agn fraction and space density .",
    "most importantly , we define the isx sample conservatively ( @xmath97 ) to avoid significant contamination from star - forming galaxies in the sample . there will be additional heavily obscured agns among those sources that are not in the isx or isn sample ( @xmath167 ; see  [ appsamples ] below for x - ray stacking results ) ; the expected number is nearly comparable to that in the isx sample given the fraction of excess sources in the distribution of @xmath94 in figure  2 .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties and incompletenesses , we expect that the true space density of heavily obscured agns at @xmath21 is @xmath1682 times that estimated above . in the following analyses",
    ", we still use our conservative estimation as it is difficult to determine the exact correction factor .",
    "we show in figure  5 the space densities of ct agns selected in this work and some previous studies ( mainly ir based ) , as well as those from model predictions by @xcite . the ct agn space density for the @xcite cdf - s sample with and @xmath169  erg  s@xmath10  is estimated to be @xmath170  mpc@xmath12 ;",

    "the interquartile range of the intrinsic 210  kev luminosities is ( 15)@xmath146  erg  s@xmath10for the ct agns in our sample , while it is ( 310)@xmath174  erg  s@xmath10  for the @xcite sample .",
    "we thus selected mainly moderate - luminosity and more typical ct agns ; this is largely attributed to the much higher sensitivities of the mid - ir and x - ray observations in the cdf - s . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that we have missed some rare , unrepresentative objects due to the smaller area of the cdf - s .",
    "we note that the data points in various studies and model predictions have been derived with different assumptions ( see , e.g. ,  3.2.2 ) and are thus not strictly comparable .",
    "we estimated the expected xrb flux in the 1030 kev band provided by the heavily obscured agns in the isx sample .",
    "we used the mytorus model to calculate the emergent flux from these agns , given their redshifts , assumed power - law photon index ( @xmath100 ) , intrinsic x - ray luminosities , and column densities ( the latter two quantities are from the simulation results ) . on average ,",
    "these agns produce a flux of @xmath175  kev  @xmath1  s@xmath10  sr@xmath10 in the  kev band , @xmath176 of which is from ct agns .",
    "the total xrb flux in this band is about 44  kev  @xmath1  s@xmath10  sr@xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , this population of @xmath21 heavily obscured ( ct ) agns selected using the isx method is expected to contribute @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) of the total xrb in the 1030 kev band .",
    "observations have not directly resolved the xrb at energies @xmath90  kev ; however , theoretical predictions have been made by population - synthesis models about the contributions from unobscured , moderately obscured , and heavily obscured agns .",
    "for example , @xcite concluded that @xmath179 of the xrb in the 1030 kev band ( the missing xrb ) is produced by ct agns , while @xcite considered the total contribution from ct agns to be @xmath180 .",
    "the predicted contribution from the ct agns selected here ( @xmath178 ) is thus @xmath181 @xcite or @xmath182 @xcite of the missing xrb in the 1030 kev band .",
    "given the expected properties ( luminosity , redshift , column density ) of the isx sources , the @xcite model predicts that @xmath183 of the missing xrb comes from such objects , agreeing well with our results .",
    "the remaining missing xrb is largely attributed to luminous ( @xmath184@xmath185  erg  s@xmath10 ) ct agns at @xmath186 @xcite ; the stacking isx sample selected here appears to have missed some of the high - luminosity objects due to the limited volume surveyed .",
    "heavily obscured agns are expected also to contribute to the xrb at energies @xmath187  kev , though with a smaller contributed fraction than that for the 1030 kev band ( see , e.g. , fig .  15b of @xcite ) .",

    "four sources in the sb and two in the hb are removed this way ; the final stacking samples include 385 sources in the 0.51 and 12 kev bands , and 387 sources in the three @xmath191 kev bands .",
    "for the optical galaxies , we chose @xmath45-band sources in the goods - s _ hst _ version r2.0z catalog @xcite with a 5 @xmath17 limiting ab magnitude of @xmath192 .",
    "we stacked the x - ray undetected optical galaxies in the central 6-radius region .",
    "galaxies within twice the 90% encircled - energy aperture radius of any known x - ray source are also removed from the stacking to avoid x - ray source contamination .",
    "there are 18272 optical sources included in the stacking .",
    "note that this galaxy sample contains all of the 23 sources in the x - ray stacking isx sample .",
    "the stacking results are shown in figure  [ xrbfrac ] .",
    "the 1  @xmath17 errors on the stacked fluxes were calculated following @xcite including measurement errors and a 3% _ chandra _  flux - calibration error . for the stacking of the x - ray sources",
    ", there is an additional poisson error due to the limited number of sources below the bright - end flux cut @xcite .",
    "taking into account both the x - ray source contribution and bright - end correction , the resolved xrb fractions are @xmath14480% in all the energy bands , indicating that the average photon index of the x - ray sources is @xmath193 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the majority of the x - ray sources in the cdf - s are obscured agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the x - ray undetected optical galaxies ,",
    "significant detections are found in all the bands except the 46 kev band , where there is only a 1  @xmath17 signal ( corresponding to a @xmath194 chance that the signal was created by poisson noise ) .",
    "we thus calculated 3  @xmath17 upper limits on the stacked counts and resolved xrb fraction in this band . in the 68 kev band ,",

    ", x - ray sources and galaxies can account for @xmath196@xmath197 of the xrb .",
    "the remaining unresolved fraction is probably due to cosmic variance in the narrow cdf - s region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it could also be partially contributed by extended x - ray sources ( e.g. , galaxy groups or clusters ) in the cdf - s .    the 2.5  @xmath17 stacked signal from galaxies in the 68 kev band ( @xmath195 of the xrb ; we refer to this as the galaxy ct xrb ) , combined with the weak signal in the 46 kev band ( @xmath198 of the xrb ) , suggest an underlying population of heavily obscured agns among the x - ray undetected galaxies ; emission in the 46 kev band is more heavily absorbed than that in the 68 kev band . as a subsample of the optical galaxies ,",
    "the 23 isx sources produce a stacked signal that is @xmath199 of the total xrb flux in the 46 kev band ; the stacked signal in the 68 kev band is weak ( 1.4  @xmath17 ) , and we estimated a 3  @xmath17 upper limit that is @xmath200 of the total xrb . therefore ,",
    "in the 68 kev band , the isx sources contribute @xmath15 of the galaxy ct xrb .",
    "it is expected that there are some additional heavily obscured agns not selected with the isx method among the optical galaxies ( see  4.1 and  4.3 ) .",
    "the number density of such objects is of about the same order of magnitude as the isx sources .",
    "based on the model in @xcite , we derived that heavily obscured agns below the 4  ms sensitivity limit are responsible for @xmath201 of the xrb in the 68 kev band ( we refer to this model prediction as the model ct xrb ) .",
    "this model ct xrb is only @xmath164 of the galaxy ct xrb , due to possible cosmic variance in the and uncertainties in the model assumptions ( e.g. , assumptions about the spectral shape , ct agn number density , and obscured fraction ; see  9 of @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "we also note that the @xcite model does not include low - luminosity ( @xmath202  erg  s@xmath10 ) agns .",
    "ir studies suggest that the agn fraction in low - mass galaxies may be significantly higher than previously reported using optical spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the obscured agn fraction also increases as luminosity decreases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is thus probable that low - luminosity heavily obscured agns have a significant stacked contribution to the galaxy ct xrb .",
    "these agns are faint in the x - ray band and challenging to identify even in deep _",
    "chandra _  observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their ir luminosities are more likely to be dominated by host - galaxy emission and thus are difficult to detect with the isx method ( or any ir - based method ) .",
    "we extracted three additional x - ray stacking samples with @xmath167 to test whether there are agns among these sources .",
    "we further break the isx sample into two subsamples to explore how the stacking results depend on the @xmath94 threshold value .",
    "the threshold cuts in @xmath94 for these samples ( samples a1a5 ) are listed in table  2 , and they were chosen so that each sample has a similar number ( @xmath46 ) of sources .",
    "we performed x - ray stacking analyses on the two subsamples and three additional samples following the same procedure as that for the isx and isn samples .",
    "the results are presented in table  2 . due to limited sample sizes ,",
    "these samples have less - significant detections in the hb than the isx sample .",
    "however , the band ratios and effective photon indices for samples all suggest heavily obscured agn contributions to the stacked x - ray signals .",
    "a plot of the effective photon index as a function of the average @xmath94 is shown in figure  7 ; in general , the larger the @xmath94 threshold value ( more ir excess ) , the harder the stacked signal .",
    "similar behavior has also been observed by @xcite , and it is likely due to less contamination from star - forming galaxies at larger threshold values ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "given the stacking results for these additional samples , it is not likely that the hard x - ray stacked signal of the isx sample was produced by coincidence .          a potentially straightforward way to detect distant heavily obscured or ct",
    "agns is via hard observations at @xmath46100  kev .",
    "several future hard x - ray missions , such as _ nustar _ ( planned launch year 2012 ; @xcite ) and _ astro - h _ ( planned launch year 2014 ; @xcite ) , have as one science goal to detect hard x - ray emission from distant heavily obscured agns .",
    "for the three typical hard x - ray bands of _ nustar _ , , 1030 kev , and 3060  kev , the expected sensitivity limits are @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath10  for a 1  ms exposure , respectively .",
    "these flux limits are about two orders of magnitude more sensitive than those of previous missions .",
    "the sensitivities are expected to be comparable to those for _ nustar_. the angular resolutions ( half - power diameters ) of _ nustar _ and are expected to be @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "positional accuracy is expected to be @xmath208 for strong sources . to assess",
    "if the agns in our isx samples at @xmath21 will be detectable , we utilized the properties for sources in the x - ray stacking isx sample from the best - fit simulations ( for the 74% agn fraction ) and the mytorus model to calculate their expected fluxes in the _ nustar _ bands . only a tiny fraction ( @xmath209 ) of the simulated sources in our 10000 simulations",
    "have fluxes above the _ nustar _ sensitivity limit in its most sensitive band ( ) ; this corresponds to no detected sources expected within the @xmath156 heavily obscured agns in the stacking isx sample ( or one detectable source among all the 242 isx objects ) . the median simulated flux in the  kev band ( @xmath210  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath10 ) is about two orders of magnitude below the sensitivity limit .",
    "this result is a natural consequence of the requirement that the sources are not individually detected in the 28 kev band of the 4  ms _ chandra _  exposure ; the extraordinarily high sensitivity of the 4 ms cdf - s places a tight constraint on the intrinsic luminosities of the isx sources and prevents them from being detected by _",
    "nustar_. therefore , it is not likely that _ nustar _ or _ astro - h _ will detect any of the isx sources presented here .",
    "however , they will probably detect some of the x - ray selected ct agn candidates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in hard x - rays ; such detections will be useful for a clear determination of the intrinsic spectral shape and power of these sources .",
    "one other approach to identify heavily obscured or ct agns is via x - ray spectroscopy at relatively low energies ( @xmath187  kev ) complemented by multiwavelength data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emission of these objects is characterized by a flat continuum and often a strong rest - frame 6.4  kev iron k@xmath127 fluorescent line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the isx sources presented here , spectroscopic analyses are probably not feasible due to the small number of counts expected",
    ". however , it is worth performing a further study of the selected ct agn candidates in @xcite , which were previously studied using only the 1  ms cdf - s data . with the current 4  ms cdf - s data and the 3  ms observations on the cdf - s",
    ", we will be able to constrain better their nature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of the cdf - s receiving further _ chandra _  exposure ( e.g. , 10  ms total ) , some ( @xmath182 ) of the heavily obscured agns in the isx sample could be detected in the hb , given the simulated properties and expected 10  ms sensitivity .    given the above , the majority of the heavily obscured agns in the isx sample will remain undetected in the x - ray , and the few percent of the xrb at @xmath46100  kev produced by these agns can not be directly resolved in the near future .",
    "we note that x - ray absorption variability appears common among local seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a few sources have even exhibited ct to compton - thin transitions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , a fraction of the isx agns may be detectable in the future if they become less obscured due to absorption variability .",
    "also , optical / mid - ir spectroscopy has been shown to be a promising technique for identifying distant heavily obscured agns , particularly when combined with sensitive x - ray constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "future optical / ir instruments such as the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ ) , extremely large telescopes ( elts ) , and atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will provide great opportunities for detecting the remaining sources .",
    "we have identified a population of heavily obscured / ct agns at @xmath21 in the cdf - s and e - cdf - s utilizing the isx selection method .",
    "the key points from this work are listed below :    1 .",
    "we have improved the isx method from @xcite by deriving the dust extinction via sed fitting and studying sources at lower redshifts with no bias in their ir - luminosity calculation .",
    "the isx method can be well applied to the x - ray undetected galaxies in the cdf - s region at @xmath21 , given the superb multiwavelength data available .",
    "the parent sample of 1313 galaxies were defined from an initial sample of 5237 optically and 24  @xmath32 m selected sources in the e - cdf - s , with the requirements of selected redshift interval , excellent multiwavelength coverage , high stellar mass , and no x - ray detection (  2 ) .",
    "2 .   we have identified 242 isx sources in the cdf - s and e - cdf - s at @xmath21 ; these sources tend to be hosted by evolved galaxies with high stellar mass and little dust (  2.2 ) .",
    "an x - ray stacking analysis of 23 of the objects in the central cdf - s region resulted in a very hard x - ray signal with an effective photon index of @xmath3 , indicating a significant contribution from obscured agns (  3.1 ) .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations to estimate the agn fraction in the isx sample and assess the intrinsic properties of the obscured agns .",
    "we modeled the observed x - ray flux considering both the star - formation and agn contributions , and we utilized the mytorus model to treat the spectra of heavily obscured agns .",
    "the requirement that the sources are not individually detected in the 4 ms cdf - s sets strong constraints on their intrinsic properties .",
    "we infer that @xmath4 of the isx sources are obscured agns , within which @xmath5 are heavily obscured and @xmath6 are ct (  3.2 ) .",
    "the heavily obscured ( ct ) agns discovered in our isx sample have moderate intrinsic x - ray luminosities ; the interquartile range of the intrinsic 210  kev luminosities is  erg  s@xmath10  [ ( 15)@xmath146  erg  s@xmath10 ] .",
    "the space density of the heavily obscured ( ct ) agns is @xmath162  mpc@xmath12 [ @xmath11  mpc@xmath12 ]",
    ". these heavily obscured ( ct ) agns are expected to contribute @xmath211 ( @xmath178 ) of the total xrb flux in the 1030 kev band . in the 68 kev band ,",
    "the 23 isx sources provide @xmath212 of the xrb flux .",
    "the x - ray undetected optical galaxies in the cdf - s produce a 2.5  @xmath17 stacked signal in the 68 kev band , accounting for @xmath195 of the xrb flux , which is about the entire unresolved xrb fraction .",
    "the space density of the isx agns and their contribution to the xrb could be increased by a factor of @xmath2132 due to our conservative isx definition (  4 ) .",
    "these heavily obscured or ct agns will probably not be detected by hard x - ray observatories under development such as _ nustar _ or _ astro - h _ due to their moderate intrinsic x - ray luminosities and significant obscuration .",
    "most of the hard x - ray sources that will be detected by these facilities are likely already detected in the 4 ms cdf - s given the extremely high sensitivity of _ chandra _  to point sources (  4.4 ) .",
    "the isx selection method presented in this paper can be applied to other survey fields with good optical - to - ir coverage , and it can be expanded to higher redshifts if the ir luminosity can be estimated reliably , e.g. , combining mips 24  @xmath32 m data with data from deep _ herschel _ surveys at 100 and 160  @xmath32 m ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
