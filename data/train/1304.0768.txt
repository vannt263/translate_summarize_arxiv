    "over the past decade , measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ) at redshift @xmath3 have extended the observed population to a time when the universe was matter dominated @xcite . at these lookback times of @xmath4gyr ,",
    "the predicted effects of dark energy are small , while the typical conditions under which sne form are increasingly different from local environments .",
    "these characteristics may allow observations at high redshift to constrain an evolutionary change in snia brightness independent of our understanding of dark energy .",
    "this type of systematic shift in magnitude could be caused by changing metallicity or progenitor masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such an effect could be present at a lower level in intermediate - redshift sn samples ( @xmath5 ) , and therefore be a source of uncertainty in the determination of the dark energy equation - of - state parameter ( @xmath6 ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of high - redshift sneia could also place constraints on the binary companions of sn progenitors .",
    "the two most likely snia progenitor models are the single - degenerate scenario , where a white dwarf accretes matter from a main - sequence or giant companion , and the double - degenerate scenario , where sne occur through the merging of two carbon - oxygen ( c - o ) white dwarfs .",
    "a substantial difference between these mechanisms , however , is the typical time interval from progenitor formation to explosion ; progenitors would likely take @xmath7yr to reach the chandrasekhar limit by mass transfer from a nondegenerate companion , but would more often take less time in a system of two c - o white dwarfs ( for a recent review of snia progenitors , see @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of times between formation and explosion , known as the delay - time distribution ( dtd ) , can therefore be used to set constraints on sn progenitor models .",
    "observations of sn rates measure the convolution of the dtd with the cosmic star - formation history , and high - redshift rates are the most sensitive to delay times @xcite .    due to the high sensitivity and angular resolution of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    ", its advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) has been the most effective instrument for observing and monitoring sne out to @xmath8 .",
    "to find sne at higher redshifts in the rest - frame optical , where they are brightest and we understand them best , searching in the near - infrared ( ir ) with the recently installed wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) allows sn surveys to reach unprecedented depths not accessible from the ground ( f160w limiting vega magnitude @xmath9 , equal to the peak observed brightness of a typical snia at @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath11 from the center of the host galaxy ( 2 acs pixels ) .",
    "the contours plotted on the difference image of the sn ( upper left ) show the regions containing 68% and 95% of the host galaxy light .",
    "the center of the nearest neighboring galaxy , which causes minimal lensing of the sn ( see  4.1 ) , is located @xmath12@xmath13 away.,width=321,height=321 ]    in this paper we present observations of a snia at @xmath14 ( sn uds10wil ) , the highest - redshift snia discovered to date .",
    "it was found in the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , pi : faber & ferguson ; @xcite ) .",
    "the full candels sn sample is designed to measure sn rates and to study sn systematics at redshifts greater than 1.5 .",
    "similar to sn primo , a @xmath15 wfc3-discovered sn @xcite , uds10wil  also has spectroscopic evidence for classification .",
    "we present the discovery of sn uds10wil  in  2 .",

    "we remeasured the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the sn uds10wil  host galaxy , including photometry from late - time wfc3 and acs templates as well as subaru , ukirt , and irac data .",
    "the balmer break is between the subaru @xmath28 band and the wfc3 @xmath29 band , making the most likely redshift between 1.8 and 2.2 ( see the lower - left panel of fig . [",

    "however , the grism spectrum can not resolve the doublet , as the spectrum is convolved with both the shape of the host galaxy and the point - spread function ( psf ; combined full width at half - maximum intensity @xmath31 ) and sampled at a resolution of only 46.5pixel@xmath32 .",

    "we classified sn uds10wil  by analyzing its light curve and spectrum , informed by the host redshift .",
    "as detailed below , we first examined the light curve , finding that it is consistent only with a snia .",
    "in particular , the combination of its early - time colors with its rapid late - time decline rate does not agree with cc sn models .",
    "we then used the spectrum to independently rule out sneii . while the spectral absorption features alone are unable to convincingly distinguish between a snia and a snib / c , sneii have features that are inconsistent with the data ( see @xcite for a review of sn spectra ) .      to classify sn uds10wil",
    "we compared the observed uds10wil  light curve against monte carlo simulations of type ia and cc sne at redshift 1.91 , generated with the supernova analysis software ( snana ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used a least - squares fit to scale the magnitude of the simulated light curves to match our data , thus allowing us to examine how our data compare to the shapes and colors of simulated sne while removing any assumptions on cosmology or intrinsic sn luminosity .",
    "we then measured the @xmath33 statistic for each simulated sn compared to our data and converted these @xmath33 values into a type ia sn classification probability using a simple bayesian framework , similar to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the full bayesian formalism , along with a description of the simulations and our bayesian priors , is presented in the appendix .",
    "our procedure gives us a very high probability that sn uds10wil  is a snia . as such , varying our priors on parameters such as shape , color , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or sn rates has a very minor effect on the outcome .",
    "the reliance on only 43 ccsn  templates constitutes the greatest uncertainty in our procedure .",
    "however , using a classification procedure very similar to ours , @xcite found that classification using only 8 ccsn templates still returns snia classification purities of @xmath36% .",
    "we find that the probability of a snia was 99.98% , with a snib / c probability of @xmath37 ( ruled out at @xmath383.7@xmath26 ) and a snii probability of @xmath39 ( ruled out at @xmath385.3@xmath26 ) .",
    "this indicates that the type ia model dominates the probability calculation , and no ccsn  models can adequately describe the observed photometric data .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows the best - fit light curves , along with the flux range of simulated sn light curves encompassing 95% of the bayesian evidence for each sn type .",
    "the best - fit light curves for types ia , ib / c , and ii sne return @xmath40 values of 18.6/11 , 35.5/11 , and 51.1/11 , respectively . note that these @xmath33 values are only illustrative of the quality of the match for each model .",
    "they represent the best match from a large but limited number of random simulations , so one can not use these values in @xmath33 goodness - of - fit tests for model rejection . by contrast",
    ", the final classification probability relies on the weight of evidence from all realizations of each model .",
    "our best - fit @xmath41 and @xmath42 values for the type ia model were @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "[ sec : lightcurve ] ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "we note that if we increase the errors such that the snia @xmath47 ( accounting for the possibility that we underestimated the uncertainties ) , the type ia probability is still as high as 99.84% .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows that the nearly 100% probability of classification as a snia ( and the superior best - fit @xmath33 value ) arises because the snib / c and snii light - curve fits are unable to match the combination of sn uds10wil s high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) discovery - epoch colors and its rapid light - curve decline rate .    as a verification of this light - curve classification",
    ", we used the photometric supernova identification software ( psnid ; @xcite ) , finding that it also prefers a snia with a slightly higher 4.1@xmath26 confidence .",
    "the difference in probability is primarily due to our conservative cc model uncertainties ( see the appendix ) , which reduce the @xmath33 values of ccsne .",
    "although it only uses 8 ccsne , the purity of psnid classifications has been robustly tested using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) sne , and it obtained the highest figure of merit in the sn photometric classification challenge @xcite .    [",
    "sec : colors ]      spectroscopic confirmation of sne has proven challenging at these redshifts ( see the discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) , due to the difficulty of obtaining high s / n observations and the paucity of defining features in the available window ( for uds10wil , @xmath481.65@xmath49 m ; rest frame @xmath505660 ) . in the case of sn uds10wil ,",
    "the sn was separated from its host galaxy by only @xmath22@xmath11 , contaminating the sn spectrum with host - galaxy light .",
    "we removed the host galaxy from the spectrum by subtracting a section of the galaxy free from sn light , but the combined noise from the sn and host - galaxy spectra made a spectral classification inconclusive , even with substantial host - galaxy smoothing .",
    "as an alternative approach that avoids adding additional host - galaxy noise to the sn spectrum , we generated a noise - free synthetic host spectrum .",
    "we fit seds , using a library of spectral templates , to optical and near - ir subaru , acs , wfc3 , and ukirt host - galaxy photometry following @xcite .",
    "we then simulated the observed grism host spectrum with the axesim software package . ]",
    "the axesim software convolves the sed with the shape of the host galaxy and _ hst _ psf and samples the spectrum at the g141 spectral resolution of 46.5pixel@xmath32 .",
    "one would not necessarily expect emission lines to be the same strength in the template as in the real galaxy due to its differing metallicity , star formation rate , and population of massive stars .",
    "therefore , we replaced the pixels covering the [ ] line in our simulated host galaxy with those covering the prominent [ ] line from the grism spectrum .",
    "we omitted these pixels ( the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) when we later fit spectral templates to the sn spectrum , as we did not have a sn - free line measurement to subtract from the observations .",
    "we then rescaled the axesim output spectrum to match the f160w magnitude of the host galaxy as measured in the last epoch of follow - up imaging after the sn had faded .",
    "our simulated host - galaxy spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : spec ] ( upper left ) .",
    "after subtracting the host - galaxy model from the sn spectrum contaminated with host light , we used the supernova identification ( snid ) code ] from @xcite to match the uds10wil  spectrum with type ia , type ib / c , and type ii sn template spectra to determine the best - fit spectrum for each class . for snia fits , we only used templates within @xmath51 rest - frame days of the age of the sn uds10wil  spectrum",
    ". the age is based on the salt2 fit in  4.2 , which gives @xmath52 day after maximum ( rest frame ) .",
    "for ccsn fits , we used any templates which put the time of maximum between the first two epochs of observation ( the same as our prior in  3.1 ) .",
    "when fitting the spectrum to templates , snid removes the continuum using a high - order polynomial fit and only matches the spectral features , making the fit independent of reddening and brightness .",
    "snid returns the _",
    "_ r__lap parameter , which is meant to quantify the quality of the correlation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that _ _ r__lap values less than 5 are inconclusive .",
    "note that snid does not apply a broadening symmetric function @xcite , which should be used when the widths of sn features are comparable to the resolution of the spectrum . as the rest - frame g141 resolution is",
    "@xmath53  pixel@xmath32 and significant sn features have a typical width @xmath54 , this is not a major concern",
    ". however , the inclusion of this function for grism data could improve future snid classifications , especially those at lower redshift .",
    "the right side of figure [ fig : spec ] shows the best - fit type ia , ib / c , and ii sn templates with _ _ r__lap values of 4.8 , 2.7 , and 1.9 , respectively .",
    "we show median bins to emphasize the spectral features , but we fit spectra to the unbinned data .",
    "the data can be fit by 6 other normal sneia with @xmath55lap values of at least 4 .",
    "five other snib / c fits have an @xmath55lap of at least 2 , and only two other snii fits have an @xmath55lap of greater than 1.5 .    the @xmath33 values for the fits , now including continuum , to type ia , ib / c , and ii sne are 95.9 , 97.9 , and 104.0 ( respectively ) with 106 degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that both sneia and sneib / c can provide good fits , although the former give a slightly better match .",
    "however , all snii templates yield a poor correlation ; the rest - frame features at @xmath56 and @xmath57  ( which are created by neighboring , , , and absorption in sneia ; @xcite ) are not well fit by the spectra of sneii .",
    "we note that although not all of the snid sneii are as featureless as the best - fit spectrum shown in figure [ fig : spec ] , they all have difficulty matching the strength or location of the spectral features .",
    "even type ii - p templates , which typically have stronger features , have a maximum @xmath55lap of only 1.4 .",
    "because the best @xmath55lap value is less than 5 , this sn can not be considered to be spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "in addition , the `` lap '' parameter , which describes the overlap in wavelength space between the template and sn spectrum , is 0.39 for each of the best - fit snia and ccsn templates .",
    "this is below the minimum lap of 0.4 used by @xcite for spectral confirmation .",
    "however , the sn uds10wil  spectrum still favors classification as a snia and its @xmath55lap is comparable to that of other high - redshift sneia .",
    "sn primo ( @xcite ; @xmath15 ) had an @xmath55lap of only 3.7 .",
    "we also fit the spectrum of sn scp-0401 ( @xcite ; @xmath58 ) , finding that it is best matched by featureless snid type ia and type ib / c spectra . however",
    ", if we require a match to at least one spectral feature or a lap value greater than 0.1 , the maximum snia @xmath55lap is 4.6 ( sn 1993ac , @xmath59 days ; lap of 0.2 ) .",
    "snid templates begin at @xmath60 , so the first @xmath61  of the sn scp-0401 spectrum were not included in the snid fit .",
    "taken together , the photometric evidence suggests that uds10wil  is a snia with high confidence .",
    "the spectroscopic evidence independently favors a type ia classification . we now proceed to derive its shape and color - corrected magnitude , taking into account the possibility that the sn light has been gravitationally lensed by foreground structure .",

    "gravitational lensing can significantly magnify the sn , altering our measurement of its distance .",
    "sn uds10wil  is close in projection to another galaxy ( see fig . [",

    "therefore , it is necessary to estimate the possible magnification of the sn which could lead to a bias in the derived snia distance .",

    "wfc3 now allows the cosmological study of sneia at higher redshifts than ever before .",
    "the analysis presented above is enabled by the photometric classification methods we employ . however , sn science , especially cosmology , has in the past relied heavily on spectroscopic evidence for classification .    at @xmath2 , deriving a spectral classification with _",
    "hst _ requires a large number of orbits to obtain a high s / n .",
    "in addition , the _ hst _ ir grisms cover a relatively small rest - frame wavelength range . in the case of sn uds10wil , the g141 grism wavelength range ( @xmath481.65@xmath49 m ; rest frame @xmath505660 ) does not include either the absorption at @xmath99  or the h&k trough at @xmath100 , which are some of the deepest snia features ( the features have equivalent widths @xmath101 ) .",
    "this means that spectral classifications of high - redshift sne using snid will have lower - significance correlations with snia template spectra , and thus often yield @xmath55lap values much less than the suggested minimum of 5 @xcite",
    ".    host - galaxy contamination can be a significant source of noise in high-@xmath28 sn grism spectra . in this work",
    "we have used axesim to remove host - galaxy light from the sn+host spectrum . however , even in a situation where a sn is well separated from its host galaxy , spectral evidence alone may not be enough to unequivocally classify the sn as type ia .",
    "figure [ fig : expspec ] shows the number of _ hst _ orbits with the g141 ir grism that are needed for snid to correctly distinguish a snia from a snib / c or a snii 90% of the time , in the redshift range 1.52.3 . for this figure , we used axesim to simulate 100 snia observations per unit redshift with 2.6ks per orbit , from 0 to 100 orbits ( 2-orbit intervals ) .",
    "the background flux was set to 95e@xmath102s@xmath32 , and the simulated sn magnitude was fixed at the peak magnitude of sn primo ( an f160w vega magnitude of 23.98 ; primo was observed closer to maximum than uds10wil ) .",
    "each simulated grism spectrum was then processed with snid , and the classification was deemed correct if the best @xmath55lap for a snia template was larger than the best snib / c or snii @xmath55lap ( we allow @xmath55lap @xmath103 5 )",
    ".    figure [ fig : expspec ] shows that , similar to the case of sn uds10wil , ruling out a snii possibility requires only @xmath38510 orbits ( 1.5 @xmath104 2.3 ) . for a large program like candels , with 200 follow - up orbits and a desired sample of @xmath3810 sne , this is a feasible number .",
    "ruling out a snib / c , however , can require up to 25 orbits , becoming most costly at those redshifts where and h&k are not completely visible .",
    "at very high redshift , such as @xmath1052.3 , figure [ fig : expspec ] shows that the g141 exposure time required to distinguish a snia from a snib / c begins to drop . the value of spectroscopic confirmation for such high - redshift sne may warrant the necessary investment of orbits , especially if additional high - value targets can be simultaneously observed within the grism field of view .",
    "we note that simulating ccsn observations shows that snid can occasionally misclassify ccsne as sneia , an effect we have not taken into account in this analysis .",
    "the g102 grism can also be useful for picking out features such as and h&k in the redshift ranges where the g141 grism does not contain them .",
    "unfortunately , the consequence of its more limited wavelength range ( @xmath1061.15@xmath49 m ; rest frame @xmath1073950  at @xmath14 ) is that a snib / c template is more likely to match a snia g102 spectrum well .",
    "_ hst _ grism spectroscopy can be good at determining sn redshifts or host - galaxy properties .",
    "however , for reliable sn classification , photometric evidence is often important .",
    "in the case of sn uds10wil we improved upon the photometric methods of @xcite by introducing a quantitative bayesian method that returns probabilities for each sn type . with both photometric and spectroscopic methods",
    ", we can be confident in our classification and subsequent analysis .",
    "at a redshift of 1.914 , sn uds10wil  is the most distant snia yet known .",
    "classification of this sn rests on photometry and grism spectroscopy , which rules out the possibility of a cc sn .",
    "the spectral evidence alone disfavors the possibility of a snii , while supporting a snia or snib / c hypothesis .",
    "the combined sn colors and rapid decline rate are inconsistent with a cc sn and in good agreement with a snia model .",

    "an alternative fit with mlcs @xcite is slightly brighter than @xmath1cdm , but consistent at 1.15@xmath26 .",
    "when the full analysis of the candels sne is complete and combined with the data from the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( pi : postman ; @xcite ) , we expect that sn uds10wil  will be one of a sample of @xmath108 sneia above a redshift of 1.5 to be found by these programs .",
    "this sn is an example of an object in a new area of sn cosmology , one which has only begun to be explored in the last few years with the advent of wfc3 on _ hst _ and one with unique classification challenges .",

    "we began our classification procedure by using snana @xcite to generate a monte carlo simulation of 30,000 sne at redshift 1.91 .",
    "10,000 simulated sneia were based on the salt2 model @xcite , with values of the shape parameter @xmath41 drawn uniformly in the range @xmath109 to 3 and the color parameter @xmath42 from @xmath110 to 0.6 .",
    "these ranges cover the observed distribution of salt2 parameter values @xcite , and the @xmath42 term accounts for both intrinsic sn color and host - galaxy extinction @xcite .",
    "the remaining 20,000 simulated sne were split evenly between the two principal ccsn  classes , with light curves based on 16 type ib / c and 27 type ii sn templates that comprise the snana non - snia library ( including subtypes ib , ic , ii - p , iin , and ii - l ) .",
    "host - galaxy reddening was applied to each simulated ccsn  using  = 3.1 , with a random draw of  in the range 0 to 7mag using the @xcite reddening law .",
    "for both the snia  and the ccsn   simulations we chose random values for the date of the light - curve peak , using a range spanning the first to the second epoch of uds10wil  observations .        where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the fluxes and uncertainties for each observation .",
    "here @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the fluxes and uncertainties ( respectively ) for a single simulated sn on each observation date .",
    "the variable @xmath117 is a scaling parameter , described below . for sneia ,",
    "most of their intrinsic variability can be described by the salt2 model s shape and color parameters .",
    "additional variability causes scatter about the hubble diagram , and is given by @xcite as 8.7% in distance modulus .",
    "we treat this variability as approximately equal to the model uncertainty , which in flux space translates to @xmath118 .",
    "ccsne have greater heterogeneity , such that our relatively small set of discrete templates can not describe the entire population . by setting a nonzero @xmath119 ,",
    "our limited ccsn template library can more accurately represent this diverse class . considering a similar problem , @xcite estimated @xmath119 by measuring the flux difference between all possible pairwise comparisons of templates of the same subclass and taking the median .",
    "we classify sn uds10wil  using more templates than @xcite , such that the ccsn population is better sampled and less uncertainty is present . however , we adopt their value of @xmath120 as a conservative estimate . we next chose the optimal distance or absolute magnitude of every simulated sn , therefore removing the assumptions on cosmology and sn luminosity functions that are built into the snana simulations . here",
    "we have multiplied @xmath115 by @xmath117 , a free parameter that introduces a coherent flux scaling across all bands .",
    "we find a separate value for @xmath117 with each of the 30,000 comparisons , using @xmath33 minimization to match the simulated magnitudes to the data with the equation      we then converted the measured @xmath33 values into a type ia sn classification probability using a simple bayesian framework , similar to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the _ likelihood _ that the data ( @xmath122 ) match a simulated sn of type @xmath123 with parameters @xmath124 ( shape @xmath41 , color @xmath42 for sn ia or @xmath34 for ccsn types , and time of maximum light ) is given by      where @xmath33 is given in equation 1 .",
    "multiplying by prior probability distributions for each of the model parameters then gives us the _ posterior probability _ for each point in parameter space , @xmath126 .",
    "as we are interested in model selection , not parameter estimation , we can marginalize over all of the nuisance parameters @xmath124 . approximating the marginalization integral with a discrete sum ,",
    "the probability of sn type @xmath123 given the model is      for snia parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we applied gaussian priors based on the values given by @xcite ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) . for the cc sne parameter @xmath34",
    ", we used the monte carlo recipe provided by @xcite and implemented by @xcite for a random galaxy orientation .",
    "the distribution is peaked at @xmath128 mag and falls off quickly such that @xmath129mag is very unlikely .",
    "we used a flat prior for the time of peak brightness .",
    "note that for computational efficiency we have used snana to sample the multi - dimensional model parameter space using a monte carlo simulation with uniform sampling distributions ( instead of the more typical approach , using a grid of parameter values ) .",
    "thus , we must approximate @xmath130  the vector of step sizes along each dimension of parameter space  using the range over which each parameter is sampled :      where @xmath132 is each range , @xmath133 is the number of simulated sne in the class ( we used 10,000 ) , and the product is over @xmath134 , the number of parameters @xmath135 for the model : 3 for sneia ( @xmath41 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) and 2 for ccsne ( @xmath34 , @xmath137 ) .",
    "lastly , we multiplied each model by a sn rate prior @xmath138 .",
    "this prior is the fraction of sne at redshift 1.91 that we expect to be a given type .",
    "we began by adopting the rate measurement from @xcite for sneia and the local rates from @xcite for ccsne .",
    "we scaled the ccsn rates according to the cosmic star - formation history of @xcite using the form of @xcite and a modified salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "the normalized rates showed , as an estimate , that one could expect only @xmath23% of sne at this redshift to be of type ia .",
    "the sn uds10wil  host galaxy sed (  3.2 ) is consistent with a starburst galaxy , so it is possible that these average rates overestimate the snia rate in this galaxy .",
    "in addition , sn rates are very uncertain at this redshift , and the @xcite rates at this redshift are consistent with 0 sne ia ; however , we note that lowering this rates prior by an order of magnitude still returns a classification probability greater than 99% . thus the result is largely independent of the uncertainty in snia rates .        where the summation is over type ia , ib / c , and ii sn models ( @xmath123 ) . in the case of sn uds10wil , our likelihood function is sufficiently narrow that the priors have only a minor effect .",
    "thus , we found that allowing @xmath35 , salt2 parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 , or parameter ranges to vary does not substantially alter the high probability that this sn is of type ia ."
