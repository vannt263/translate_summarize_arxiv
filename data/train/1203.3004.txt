    "the homotopy theory of simplicial sets was developed mostly by kan in the 1950 s .",
    "his work made homotopy theory independent of general topology . in the 1960 s quillen",
    "[ 13 ] organized the homotopy theory of simplicial sets in the framework of model categories which is a modern foundation of homotopy theory . the category of simplicial sets is not only an example of a model category but also an indispensable ingredient of model category theory ( cf .",
    "[ 4 - 6 ] ) .",
    "thus simplicial sets and their model structure have become essential in various field of mathematics as model categories have been important in abstract homotopy theory and its applications [ 2 , 7 , 10 - 12 ] .",
    "the organizing theorem of simplicial homotopy theory asserts that simplicial sets form a model category . by definition",
    "a model category is just an ordinary category with three specified classes of morphisms , called fibrations , cofibrations and weak equivalences , which satisfy several axioms .",
    "thus the proof of the organizing theorem is nothing but verification of the model axioms for the category of simplicial sets and it is , as goerss and jardine [ 4 , p. 2 ] say,``still one of the more difficult proofs of abstract homotopy theory '' ( see also [ 6 , p. 73 ] ) .",
    "quillen s method [ 13 ] of verification is purely simplicial .",
    "but he was `` unable to find a really elementary proof '' ; it uses even the classification theory of principal bundles due to barratt - guggenheim - moore [ 1 ] ( [ 13 , introduction of chapter ii ] ) .",
    "thus goerss and jardine [ 4 , chapter i ] appeal to topological methods to show the organizing theorem of simplicial homotopy theory ( especially note the definition of a weak equivalence [ 4 , p. 60",
    "] and the result on the realization of a kan fibration [ 4 , pp .",
    "54 - 59 ] ) .",
    "but the principle of simplicial homotopy theory is to develope homotopy theory excluding topological methods , hence the proof of the organizing theorem should be purely simplicial but not topological .",
    "main objective of this paper is to give a proof of the following organizing theorem of simplicial homotopy theory which is elementary in the sense that it does not use the classifying theory of principal bundles or appeal to topological methods .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the category of simplicial sets",
    ". if @xmath6 is a kan complex , the homotopy set @xmath7 $ ] is defined as the set of homotopy classes of maps from @xmath8 to @xmath6 ( see section 2 ) .",
    "define a map @xmath9 in @xmath5 to be ( 1 ) a fibration if the map @xmath10 is a kan fibration , ( 2 ) a weak equivalence if the map @xmath10 induces a bijection @xmath11 \\longrightarrow [ x , z]$ ] for any kan complex @xmath6 , and ( 3 ) a cofibration if the map @xmath10 has the left lifting property with respect to each map which is both a fibration and a weak equivalence .",
    "then with these choices @xmath5 is a model category .",
    "in fact we show that the category @xmath5 with the specified classes of morphisms satisfies stronger model axioms , which are adopted in [ 5 ] ( c.f .",
    "section 2 ) .",
    "in other words the category @xmath5 is complete and cocomplete , and the factorizations described in the so - called factorization axiom are functorially constructed .",
    "we adopt the definition of a weak equivalence different from those of quillen [ 13 , 3.14 in chapter ii ] and goerss - jardine [ 4 , p. 60",
    "] , which is a key to simplifying the proof of the organizing theorem . we also check that our model structure coincides with theirs .",
    "the model structure of @xmath5 in theorem 1.1 coincides with those of quillen and goerss - jardine .",
    "the difficulty of checking the model axioms for the category @xmath5 is having to deal with general simplicial sets which need not to be kan complexes , which is different from the case of the category of topological spaces .",
    "thus we make effective use of the powerful theory of minimal fibrations whose topological analogue does not exist ( see the arguments used in the proofs of lemmas 2.4 and 3.3 ) .",
    "the proof of theorem 1.1 is given in section 2 ; a purely simplicial proof of lemma 2.4 is crucial . in section 3 ,",
    "we investigate cofibrations and weak equivalences in the category @xmath5 .",
    "the investigation of cofibrations implies proposition 1.2 .",
    "an alternative proof of lemma 2.4 , which is the heart of the proof of theorem 1.1 , is given in section 4 .",
    "one of the advantage of this proof is that it does not need any knowledge of higher homotopy groups and homotopy exact sequences .",
    "refer to [ 4 ] for the fundamental notions and results of simplicial homotopy theory and [ 3 ] for the basic facts and the terminology of model category theory .",
    "( see also [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] for more details on model categories . )",
    "the recently published book [ 9 ] by may and ponte is also relevant to our subject .",
    "it contains another simplified proof of the organizing theorem of simplicial homotopy theory , which makes a little use of topology .",
    "we begin by recalling the standard notations and fundamental notions of the theory of simplicial sets .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the @xmath13 @xmath14-@xmath15 and @xmath16 its @xmath17-@xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the @xmath22 and the @xmath23-@xmath18 @xmath24 of @xmath12 respectively .",
