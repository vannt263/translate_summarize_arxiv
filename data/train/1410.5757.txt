    "<S> in this paper we investigate constant mean curvature surfaces with nonempty boundary in euclidean space that meet a right cylinder at a constant angle along the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> if the surface lies inside of the cylinder , we obtain some results of symmetry by using the alexandrov reflection method . when the mean curvature is zero , we give sufficient conditions to obtain that the surface is part of a plane or a catenoid . </S>"
