    "increasing the shell thickness @xmath0 leads to an increase in the critical current density @xmath49 due to partial screening of the applied field @xmath5 by supercurrents , so that a higher current must be applied in order to produce a lorentz force sufficient for vortex / antivortex depinning .",
    "the shape of the curves @xmath64 reveals several regimes .",
    "( i ) at relatively low magnetic fields , no vortices appear in the cylinder , so that the values of @xmath49 actually correspond to the transition from the meissner state to the normal state .",

    "( iii ) at even higher fields , vortices and antivortices are present in the cylinder already at @xmath65 .",
    "the critical current density decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath5 [ both due to an increase of the depinning lorentz force , proportional to @xmath5 , and an enhanced mutual repulsion of the increasing number of vortices ( antivortices ) ] .",
    "( iv ) when approaching the second critical field ( @xmath66 ) , the number and density of vortices ( antivortices ) become so large that the distances between the vortex cores are smaller than the vortex size .",
    "the resulting enhancement of mutual repulsion between vortices ( antivortices ) leads to a rather fast decrease of @xmath49 with @xmath5 in this field range . at @xmath66",
    "the curves @xmath64 exhibit a pronounced minimum .",
    "( v ) at @xmath67 , the critical current density first sharply increases and then slowly decreases . in this field range ,",
    "normal regions are formed in the cylinder around @xmath7 and @xmath68 , and the vortex dynamics involves the entrance of vortices and antivortices from the normal regions to the superconducting regions , which requires relatively high applied current densities .",

    "( iv ) can be relevant for revealing the effect of persistent currents , induced by the field @xmath4 , on vortex dynamics . as illustrated by fig .",

    "the accuracy of the shown @xmath21-values is determined by a limited averaging time in the performed calculations . when switching @xmath4 to a new value , a time interval @xmath69 , ranging from 100 to 500 , is reserved in the computational program for transient processes . within this time interval ,",
    "no calculation of @xmath21 is performed .",
    "then the voltage drop @xmath21 is averaged over a time interval @xmath70 , ranging from 500 to 5000 in the present calculations .",
    "however , our analysis shows that in the multi - vortex system under consideration the full period of vortex - antivortex generation / recombination processes can be rather long , so that in general this period is not much smaller than the used time intervals @xmath70 .",

    "the voltage @xmath21 takes maximum values for vanishing persistent currents induced by the field @xmath4 , i.e. for @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , while the sharp minima of @xmath21 approximately correspond to the maximum magnitude of the persistent currents , i.e. to @xmath75 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "in other words , the shape of these oscillations is `` inverted '' as compared to the little - parks oscillations  @xcite . the oscillating behavior of @xmath76 , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , can be explained in terms of the distortion of vortex / antivortex trajectories due to the lorentz forces caused by the persistent currents and the magnetic field @xmath5 . in figs .",
    "[ figure4](a ) to [ figure4](c ) , we plot the distributions of the streaming parameter @xmath77(a ) , in the case of @xmath13 , and hence in the absence of the corresponding persistent currents , the vortex / antivortex trajectories in the middle part of the cylinder follow a circular cross - section of the cylinder , with vortices moving from @xmath48 to @xmath78 and antivortices moving from @xmath79 to @xmath78 all at the same value of @xmath6 .",
    "vortex - vortex interactions cause only slight deviations from ideal circles .",

    "[ figure4](b ) ] or paramagnetic [ @xmath81 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure4](c ) ] currents in the cylindrical shell , these currents cause a rather pronounced deformation of vortex / antivortex trajectories , so that the path of a vortex ( antivortex ) from @xmath48 ( @xmath82 ) to @xmath47 partly follows the ellipse traced out by a slanted cross - section of the cylinder .",
    "this represents an appreciably longer path than for @xmath13 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath76 at the applied current density @xmath83 , which only slightly exceeds the critical current density @xmath84 at @xmath13 , implies that  in addition to oscillations of @xmath76 at a fixed @xmath10-value  also the critical current density @xmath49 is an oscillating function of the applied parallel magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "however , our calculations show that the corresponding oscillation amplitudes are very small . for the parameters under consideration",
    "the critical current at @xmath85 is @xmath86 , i.e. the oscillation amplitude for @xmath49 does not exceed 0.6% .",
    "thus we conclude that the voltage @xmath76 is a better indicator than the critical current to reveal the ab oscillations in vortex trajectories .     for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and different values of the applied parallel magnetic field :",

    "[ figure4],width=80 ]    besides pronounced oscillations of the voltage @xmath76 with period @xmath72 , one can see in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] several smaller features in the behavior of @xmath76 .",
    "many of those features are irregular and reflect the limited computation accuracy . however , some others are rather regular and periodic in @xmath4 . in particular , for @xmath93 ,",
    "small peaks of @xmath76 emerge at magnetic fields slightly above @xmath94 .",
    "those features can be attributed to the fact that the ( time - averaged ) number of vortex - antivortex pairs in the cylinder depends not only on the applied current density [ see figs .",
    "[ figure1](b ) and [ figure1](c ) ] but also on the parallel field @xmath4 . at the same time ,",
    "the time - averaged voltage drop @xmath21 as well as the critical current @xmath49 are , of course , sensitive to the number of vortices in the cylinder .",
    "this sensitivity leads , in particular , to the appearance of the peaks of @xmath76 for @xmath83 and @xmath4 slightly above @xmath95 .    from fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , one can also observe that the curves @xmath76 are not fully symmetric with respect to the points @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ figure3 ] , the aforementioned weak peaks of @xmath76 at @xmath93 are present at magnetic fields just above @xmath97 , but no similar peaks appear below @xmath94 . in our numerical simulations , we ramp up the magnetic field @xmath4 and calculate how the order parameter adapts to the increased field .",
    "geometric pinning of vortices in the cylinder leads to hysteresis effects and results in asymmetries in the curves . a similar pinning in superconducting spherical nanoshells",
    "has been shown to cause a pronounced hysteresis in the dependence of the number of vortex - antivortex pairs on the applied magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "also in the cylindrical shells under consideration the number of vortex - antivortex pairs and hence the curves @xmath76 demonstrate hysteretic behavior .",
    "the presence of such a hysteretic behavior is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , where we compare the dependences @xmath76 , calculated for increasing and decreasing fields @xmath4 . as seen from this inset , in the case of a decreasing field @xmath4 , small peaks of @xmath76 appear to the left from @xmath98 . within the error bars , the whole pattern of @xmath76 , where the field @xmath4 goes either up or down , looks symmetric with respect to @xmath98 .    as further seen from fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , the shape of the curve @xmath76 becomes more regular and symmetric when increasing the applied current density to the value @xmath99 , which is considerably higher than the critical current density @xmath49 .",
    "however , relatively pronounced additional features , caused by variations of the ( time - averaged ) number of vortex - antivortex pairs in the cylinder , reappear in the curve @xmath76 at @xmath100 ( fig .  [ figure3 ] ) , when  as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ figure4](d )  some precursors of phase - slip - line formation can be already seen in the order parameter pattern .",
    "remarkably , within the whole range of current densities considered here , the oscillation amplitude of @xmath76 remains appreciably large .    from fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , the magnitude of the resistivity oscillations is @xmath101 in the used units .",
    "this is about 0.5% of the normal - state resistivity , which equals 12 in our units  @xcite , so that the predicted oscillations should be observable through 4-probe measurements similar to those reported in ref .  .",
    "our calculations show that the self - inductance of the cylinders under consideration has a relatively weak effect on the resistivity oscillations ; as follows from fig .",
    "[ figure5](a ) , for @xmath102 , @xmath61 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 the oscillation magnitude is about 0.07 .",
    "this magnitude tends to decrease when increasing the radius of the cylinder and/or when decreasing its length down to values @xmath107 [ cp .",
    "[ figure5](b ) to fig .  [ figure3 ] ] .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath102 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 our calculations predict an oscillation magnitude as large as 0.01[see fig .",
    "[ figure5](b ) ] .",
    "of course , in very short cylinders with @xmath112 , which can not accommodate vortices , the predicted voltage oscillations become impossible .     as a function of an increasing magnetic field @xmath4 in the cases of ( a ) @xmath113 , @xmath15 , @xmath114 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and ( b ) @xmath113 , @xmath115 , @xmath16 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "[ figure5],width=80 ]    it seems worth emphasizing that the material and geometric parameters , required to observe the predicted resistivity oscillations , are achievable experimentally .",
    "for example , with @xmath116  nm ( close to the values of @xmath117 for al hollow cylinders in ref .  ) , the dimensionless parameters @xmath15 and @xmath118 would correspond to a hollow cylinder with radius about 640 nm ( a few times larger than the cylinder radii in ref .  ) and",
    "wall thickness about 60 nm ( twice that in ref .  ) .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that in hollow superconductor cylinders , subjected to a tilted magnetic field , the resistance , caused by vortex motion , should manifest measurable oscillations as a function of the magnetic field component parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "this effect can provide a robust tool to probe experimentally the oscillating persistent currents , related to the aharonov - bohm effect , in a wide range of parameters , in particular , much below the superconducting critical temperature .",
