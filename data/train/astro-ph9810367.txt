    "hot gas in the 30 dor nebula was first detected by the _ einstein _",
    "observatory ( wang & helfand 1991 ; chu & mac low 1990 ) .",
    "the nebula apparently consists of blisters of hot gas surrounded by h@xmath0-emitting filaments .",
    "stellar winds and supernova explosions are presumably responsible for the heating of the gas .",
    "recently , the nebula has been observed with instruments on board the _ rosat _  and _ asca _  x - ray observatories .",
    "x - ray images from some of these observations have been presented ( chu 1993 ; wang 1995a ; wang & gotthelf 1998 ) .",
    "but detailed analysis of the data is still ongoing . in this writing - up of my talk ,",
    "i review some preliminary results on hot gas properties and discuss implications on various relevant physical processes .",
    "1 shows a state - of - art high resolution x - ray image of the 30 dor nebula ( wang 1998 ) . in its core region , two point - like sources with 0.1 - 2.4",
    "kev luminosities of @xmath1 stand out and are most likely wolf - rayet + black hole binary systems ( wang 1995a ) .",
    "the presence of such systems indicates that supernovae have occurred in the recent past of 30 dor . the x - ray contribution from the central star cluster r136",
    "is also detected ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the image shows no evidence for other point - like x - ray sources which may be related to 30 dor .",
    "the detection limit is @xmath2 .",
    "there is also no correlation between the x - ray intensity and the stellar distribution .",
    "the x - ray emission is thus predominantly diffuse in origin .",
    "a three color composite image of the nebula in h@xmath0 , uv , and x - ray can be found at http://www.astro.nwu.edu/astro/wqd/images/30d.htm .",
    "wang & gotthelf ( 1998 ) have presented an overlay of x - ray contours on an h@xmath0  image and _ asca _  sis data in two energy bands .",
    "in addition , chu ( 1993 ) has shown a _ rosat _  pspc image of the nebula .",
    "these observations show that the 30 dor nebula is an interacting complex of massive stars , dense molecular clouds , photoionized hii  filaments , and diffuse hot gas .",
    "young massive stars are concentrated in r136 .",
    "but a few smaller clusters within the central region ( @xmath3 ) may also contribute significantly to the energetics of the nebula .",
    "dense molecular clouds typically appear in regions that are relatively dim in soft x - ray , apparently a result of displacement and/or x - ray absorption .",
    "the central region , in particular , shows hot gas bubbles surrounded by ionization fronts at boundaries of dense molecular clouds ( fig .",
    "an archival _ asca _  observation ( fig .",
    "3 ) provides x - ray spectroscopic information about hot gas in the 30 dor nebula ( wang 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of individual emission lines ( e.g. , ne , mg , and si ) confirms that x - ray emission in the 0.5 - 2  kev band is predominantly thermal in origin .",
    "the flat spectrum at higher energies , however , suggests the presence of a nonthermal component .",
    "a power law of energy slope equal to one describes this component well , although the exact spectral shape is uncertain because of the limited energy coverage and statistics of the data . using the raymond & smith thermal plasma to characterize the thermal portion of the spectrum",
    ", i find that at least two temperature components are needed for a reasonable good fit .",
    "these two components characterize a range of hot gas temperature 0.2 - 1 @xmath4  k in the nebula .",
    "the high temperature component dominates in the energy band @xmath5  kev , and arises primarily in the core region around r136 ( @xmath6 ; wang & gotthelf 1998 ) .",
    "the total inferred thermal energy and mass of hot gas are @xmath7  ergs and @xmath8 , contained primarily in the low temperature component .",
    "the thermal energy in the hot gas is balanced by the expected mechanical energy release from stellar winds and supernovae in the nebula .",
    "the stellar winds from r136 alone has an energy release rate of @xmath9 ( e.g. , chu & kennicutt 1992 ) . over the lifetime of r136 ,",
    "the integrated energy release is @xmath10  ergs , a large fraction of which should have been converted into the thermal energy of hot gas .",
    "there could also be tens of supernova explosions , although the exact number is difficult to estimate .    the thermal structure of the nebula",
    "is directly related to the cooling of hot gas .",
    "the radiative cooling rate of the hot gas is about @xmath11 , a reasonable fraction of the estimated energy input rate .",
    "the shocked stellar wind has a temperature @xmath12  k and is not effective in x - ray emission . as hot gas moves from the core to the halo of the nebula , adiabatic",
    "cooling may be important .",
    "the average pressure @xmath13 is about @xmath14 in the core and is a factor of @xmath15 lower in the halo .",
    "however , the corresponding adiabatic temperature drop of a factor @xmath16 is not adequate to explain the temperature difference in the two regions .",
    "the adiabatic expansion should also rarefy the gas by a factor of @xmath17 . but",
    "the measured mean hot gas densities are comparable in the two regions . therefore , mass loading needs to be considered .",
    "the most effective mass loading process is likely the dynamic mixing of hot gas with hii  gas . while the mass efficiency of massive star formation is typically only 5 - 10% ( e.g. , mckee 1989 ) , much of the parent giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) of the ob association ngc 2070 is being eroded via photon - evaporation .",
    "as the 30 dor nebula has entered the so - called champagne phase ( wang 1995b ) , the photon - evaporated hii  mass can be estimated as ( whitworth 1979 ; york et al .",
    "1989 ) @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the ionizing flux of the ob association , its effective age with the present flux , and the mean density of the gmc . only if @xmath25 of this photon - evaporated hii  gas is loaded to the shocked wind materials in the core of the nebula , can the temperature of hot gas there be explained . over the lifetime of the nebula ,",
    "the total evaporated mass is @xmath26 . in order to account for the total mass of hot gas",
    ", the mass loading over the nebula must be substantial .",
    "the dynamic mixing is evident , right within the central cavity around r136 .",
    "the cavity is clearly open to the east .",
    "the size of the cavity , as manifested by ionization fronts , is about half arcminute radius , or @xmath27  pc . multi - filter _ hst _  wfpc2 images ( scowen et al .",
    "1998 and this volume ) clearly demonstrate the presence of evaporative flows from the ionizing fronts into the interior of the cavity .",
    "such flows result from the strong pressure gradient ( a factor of @xmath28 ) between the ionization fronts and the interior of the cavity .",
    "both the interaction between stellar winds and evaporative flows and the interface between the outflows of hii  and hot gases are highly unstable .",
    "the dynamic mixing is bound to occur .",
    "supernova blastwaves can further sporadically heat large amounts of hii  gas .",
    "the high pressure in the core region tends to drive the heated gas out to the halo , leading to the blister - like morphology of the nebula .    clearly , the study of 30 dor has strong implications for the understanding of giant hii  regions in general .",
    "the early mass loading , in particular , may determine hot gas properties of supergiant bubbles and galactic chimneys , which are all evolved from giant hii  regions ( wang 1995b ) .",
