    "we assumed a fit for @xmath24 of the form @xmath77 and determined @xmath74 by optimizing the goodness of fit , or by minimizing the reduced @xmath84 of the fit , which is defined as the residual sum of squares weighted against the variance ( square of the error ) at each point , divided by the number of data points less the number of fit parameters , @xmath147 here @xmath148 is the variance , n is the number of data points and m is the number of fit parameters , which in this case is 1 since @xmath74 is manually adjusted .",
    "weighting against the variance allows us to incorporate the error in each @xmath35 measurement in our fit , while dividing by @xmath149 normalizes for the degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduced @xmath84 was calculated for several values of @xmath74 , and the results are shown in the inset of fig . 4 ( main text ) , where the minimum as determined by a quadratic fit is @xmath78 . as mentioned in the main text , an angular offset of one degree ( @xmath150 ) is sufficient to account for this value of @xmath74 when fitting to equation [ fitting ] .",
    "the intent behind using the reduced @xmath84 is not to determine the goodness of fit relative to other models , but to extract an estimate for @xmath74 and its error given the model that we propose .",
    "thus , it is the robustness of the _ minimum _ of the reduced @xmath84 that we require , not its absolute value . to ensure that our value of @xmath74 is insensitive to random error",
    ", we have examined the effect of masking various points .",
    "the removal of any one point from the data set resulted in a change in @xmath74 of @xmath151 on average , less than our uncertainty in @xmath74 of 0.021 .",
    "addtitionally , we compared our results with a similar analysis using other measures for goodness of fit ( e.g. , @xmath152 ) and found @xmath74-values within @xmath153 of 0.036 , which is again within our error estimate .",
    "here we compute the bounds that our nonlinear susceptibility measurement place on the magnitutude of the in - plane tetragonal symmetry breaking . for a single domain , broken tetragonal symmetry breaking",
    "manifests itself through the development of a finite off - diagonal component of the magnetic susceptibility , denoted by @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the volume of the domain , @xmath156 is the volume of a unit cell and @xmath157 is the magnetization per cell .",
    "now the bulk off - diagonal magnetic susceptibility involves an average over many different domains , which is zero : @xmath158 where the overbar denotes a domain average .",
    "however , the domain fluctuations in the susceptibility remain finite , given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the total volume of the sample , and it is these fluctuations that give rise to a component of @xmath53 .",
    "now the change in the bulk basal - plane nonlinear susceptibility ( i.e in the ab - plane , perpendicular to the c axis ) in the hidden order phase is then given by @xmath161 substituting in ( [ c1 ] ) , we then obtain @xmath162 thus the inter - domain fluctuations in the symmetry - breaking component of the nonlinear susceptibilty are expected to generate a contribution to @xmath163 .    to set bounds on this , we compare the anomalous basal - plane component of the nonlinear susceptibility with the nonlinear susceptibility along the z - axis , given by @xmath164 now the susceptibility in the z - direction of a single domain is given by @xmath165 so that we can write @xmath166^{2}\\frac{1}{t}\\ ] ] taking the ratio of ( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ c3 ] ) we obtain @xmath167 where we have removed the superscript `` @xmath168 '' in the ratio between basal - plane and c - axis susceptibilities in the last term .",
    "we thus see that the magnitude of the anomalous basal plane nonlinear susceptibility is substantially reduced by the squared ratio of the bulk basal - plane and c - axis susceptibilities .",
    "we can rearrange this equation to set bounds on the in - plane tetragonality as follows : @xmath169 putting in numbers , the anisotropy in the linear susceptibility is at least five , @xmath170 while the error bounds on the measurement of the in - plane nonlinear susceptibility are given by @xmath171 so that @xmath172 which sets a bound which is two orders of magnitude larger than the anisotropy measured by torque magnetometry in micron - sized tiny samples .",
    "thus there is no inconsistency between our nonlinear susceptibility measurement and previous torque magnetometry measurements .",
    "we also see that an order of magnitude improvement in the nonlinear susceptibility measurements would make it possible to observe the in - plane anisotropy using a bulk probe ."

    "<S> -0.2 cm    we now discuss the implications of these results . at the very simplest level , </S>",

    "<S> however , these simple conclusions have implications for the microscopic physics . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , we can link the ising anisotropy of the microscopic hamiltonian to the single - ion properties of the @xmath93 ions in uru@xmath0si@xmath0  , where the zeeman coupling @xmath94 is a sign of vanishing matrix elements @xmath95 . from a single - ion standpoint , </S>",
    "<S> an almost perfect ising anisotropy is a strong indication of an _ integer spin _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath96 @xmath97 ground - state with @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> high - spin ising configurations of the alternative @xmath99 @xmath100 ionic configurations are ruled out because the coupling of the local moment to the tetragonal environment mixes configurations by adding angular momenta in units of @xmath101 , for example @xmath102 and @xmath103 , leading almost inevitably to a non - zero transverse zeeman coupling when the angular momentum @xmath104 is half - integer . </S>",
    "<S> although the precise crystal - field configuration of the u ions is still uncertain @xcite , both dynamical mean - field calculations@xcite and high - resolution rixs measurements @xcite confirm the predominantly @xmath96 picture .    </S>",
    "<S> yet a single - ion picture is not enough , for the sharpness of the specific - heat anomaly , the sizable entropy and the gapping of two - thirds of the fermi surface associated with the hidden order transition@xcite all suggest an underlying _ itinerant _ ordering process . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable feature of our data is that the jump @xmath23 that reflects the itinerant ordering process exhibits a strong ising anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> this result links in with the observation of multiple spin zeroes in dhva measurements , which detect the presence of itinerant heavy quasiparticles with an ising g - factor @xmath105 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> our new results suggest that these same quasiparticles survive all the way up to the hidden order transition . in the landau theory </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify the ising - like coupling between ho and the magnetic field in terms of the squared g - factor @xmath106 .    reconciling the single - ion and itinerant perspectives , </S>",
    "<S> both supported strongly by experiment , poses a fascinating paradox . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest possibility is that the ising anisotropy of the f - electrons is a one - electron effect resulting from a renormalized , spin - orbit coupled f - band that develops at temperatures well above the hidden order transition . in this purely itinerant view , </S>",
    "<S> the hidden order is a multipolar density wave that develops within a pre - formed band of ising quasiparticles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically such quasiparticles are renormalized one - particle f - orbitals formed from high - spin orbitals with half - integer @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> provided only one @xmath108 is involved , the transverse matrix elements of the angular momentum operator @xmath109 identically vanish , leading to a perfect ising anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> such ising quasiparticles have been observed in strong spin - orbit coupled systems , but only at high symmetry points in the brillouin zone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in a tetragonal environment , when an electron resonantly scatters off an f - state , @xmath110 is only conserved @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a mobile heavy bloch wave must actively exchange @xmath112 units of angular momentum as it propagates through the lattice , leading to bloch states composed of a mixture of @xmath110 states , such as @xmath113 this inevitably gives rise to a finite transverse coupling and a finite @xmath74 in the phenomenological landau theory , ( @xmath114 ) that is ruled out by these experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative is that the itinerant f - quasiparticles carry _ integer _ angular momentum , inheriting the ising anisotropy of a localized @xmath96 local moment of the u atoms via a phase transition rather than a crossover . in this scenario , even though @xmath110 is conserved @xmath115 , ising anisotropy is preserved since the up - spin and down - spin configurations differ by at least two units of angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> however , this picture requires that the half - integer conduction electrons hybridize with the underlying integer f - states , which can only occur in the presence of a spinorial or `` hastatic '' order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the hastatic order scenario predicted the @xmath116 observed in this experiment , although theoretical efforts to develop a microscopic theory of hastatic order predicted a small transverse moment that has been shown to be absent in high - precision neutron scattering experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing of the anisotropy constant ( @xmath117 ) in our nonlinear susceptibility measurements combined with the null result reported by neutron scattering represents a fascinating challenge to our future understanding of hidden order .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuation of the ising anisotropy well above @xmath10 is also remarkable . </S>",
    "<S> while single - ion physics can give a negative ising anisotropic @xmath4 , for an isolated ising ground state doublet , or a positive , but more isotropic @xmath4 , if there are several singlets in the temperature range of interest , there is no way to explain the positive ising anisotropic @xmath4 emerging below 60k with single ion physics . </S>",
    "<S> instead , this response indicates ising anisotropic order parameter fluctuations extending up to more than three times @xmath10 , an extraordinarily large fluctuation regime .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question raised by our work is whether bulk nonlinear susceptibility measurements can be used to detect microscopic broken tetragonal symmetry that has been reported in torque magnetometry measurements @xcite . in principle , were the hidden order to possess domains with broken tetragonal symmetry , inter - domain fluctuations in the basal - plane susceptibility would manifest themselves through a finite value of @xmath118 below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the large ising anisotropy suppresses the precision for in - plane susceptibility measurement : our current work places an upper bound on the microscopic symmetry - breaking susceptibility @xmath119 such that @xmath120 that is two orders of magnitude larger than that measured by torque magnetometry on @xmath121 m size samples@xcite ( see supplementary materials ) , and thus our negative results are not inconsistent with their positive finding . </S>",
    "<S> however improvement in resolution in future measurements could make it possible to address this issue .    in summary , we have presented a detailed survey of the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility as a function of angle and temperature in the hidden order compound uru@xmath0si@xmath0  . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements showcase the unique ising anisotropy , and imply that it is a key feature of the hidden order parameter . while previous quantum oscillation measurements indicated the presence of ising quasiparticles , this ising anisotropy persists not only to the transition temperature , but all the way up to 60k , putting serious constraints on the theory of hidden order </S>",
    "<S> . it would be quite interesting to examine the nonlinear susceptibility anisotropy in and above the antiferromagnetic phase , which could be done in uru@xmath122fe@xmath123si@xmath29@xcite .    </S>",
