    "calculations of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrino - nucleon cross sections @xmath1 @xcite have attracted attention for many years since , on the one hand , uhe neutrino fluxes are predicted by cosmological models but have not yet been measured experimentally and , on the other hand , theoretical models exist for the evaluation of these cross sections .",
    "neutrino telescopes are the most promising tools for probing the distant stars and galaxies . due to their high stability and neutrality ,",
    "neutrinos arrive at a detector on a direct line from their sources , undeflected by intervening magnetic fields , with expected energy up to @xmath13 ev .",
    "whereas high - energy photons are completely absorbed by a few hundred grams/@xmath14 of material , the interaction length of a 1 tev neutrino is about 250 kilotonnes/@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "an important scientific goal of large - scale neutrino telescopes is the detection of uhe cosmic neutrinos produced outside the atmosphere , i.e. neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic rays interacting with interstellar gas , and extra - galactic neutrinos .",
    "high neutrino energy brings a number of advantages  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the charged - current cross section increases as @xmath15 for @xmath16 ev and is believed to rise as @xmath17 for higher @xmath18 .",
    "( in this paper we question the last point . ) secondly , the background of atmospheric neutrinos decreases as compared to the flux from extra - galactic sources , approximately as @xmath19    another important and promising aspect of uhe neutrino physics is the possibility to study the production of exotic objects , such as supersymmetric particles  @xcite or black holes  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of uhe neutrinos and their detection depend on the neutrino - nucleon total cross section , which has been calculated in the standard model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a striking feature of these calculations is the continued power - law growth of the cross sections with @xmath18 at highest energies .",
    "the rise with @xmath18 , on the other hand , is directly related to the very low-@xmath20 behavior of the nucleon parton distributions derived from e.g. the hera data .",
    "problems related to the unitarity bound have been discussed in  @xcite .    at ultra - high neutrino energies the total cross section is completely dominated by its deep inelastic component . the energy dependence of neutrino - nucleon cross section , as suggested from the small-@xmath20 nucleon structure functions ( sf ) measured at hera , should show a rapid increase with energy , like @xmath21  @xcite , where @xmath22 scales as @xmath23 and ranges approximately in the interval @xmath24 for @xmath25 gev@xmath26 gev@xmath27 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the highest available @xmath28 energy at hera , @xmath29 gev , is still too low as compared to the expected uhe neutrino - nucleon collision energies . for the neutrino energy @xmath30 gev ,",
    "the relevant @xmath20-region is @xmath31 , while the hera measurements extend now to @xmath32 ; however such low values of @xmath20 are measured at @xmath33 gev@xmath27 . for the interesting region of @xmath34 , sf are measured only up to @xmath35 in the d0 experiment of inclusive jets  @xcite . since studies of the uhe @xmath36 cross sections began nearly a decade ago  @xcite our knowledge about quark distributions and nucleon sf improved significantly  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we study the uhe behavior of the neutrino - nucleon charged - current cross section starting from models where nucleon sf have a milder increase .",
    "our analysis relies strongly on recent progress and our previous experience in the studies of the nucleon sf  @xcite , based on phenomenological fits , extended by qcd evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly review the steps involved in the determination of the neutrino - nucleon cross section and illustrate our approach ; in section  3 we study the asymptotic behavior of the total neutrino - nucleon cross section ; in section  4 we discuss the implications of our results for the observation of uhe neutrinos in future experiments and finally in section  5 we draw some conclusions .",
    "in order to compute the cross section for neutrino - nucleon interactions at high energies , one needs a detailed description of the quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "the special challenge of the uhe neutrino - nucleon cross section is that the @xmath37-boson propagator emphasizes smaller and smaller values of @xmath20 as the neutrino energy @xmath18 increases . in the uhe domain ,",
    "the most important contribution to the @xmath36 cross section comes from @xmath38 and hence the greatest uncertainty in the predictions comes from the small-@xmath20 extrapolation .",
    "deep inelastic scattering of uhe neutrinos is unique in the sense that it explores extreme regions of the @xmath39 phase space where no accelerators data exist .",
    "one thus must rely on predictions or assumptions regarding the nature of these distributions , in particular in the region of ultra - low @xmath20 and low @xmath40 , as well as in the region of low @xmath20 and low @xmath41    let us consider the double differential cross section for the deep inelastic scattering of neutrinos on an isoscalar target for charged - current processes .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the leading order corrections to the simple parton model and hence all parton model formulas remain unchanged except that the parton distributions now depend on @xmath20 and @xmath40 and not only on @xmath20 . in particular , the callan - gross relation , @xmath42 or @xmath43 ,",

    "the contribution of @xmath55 can in fact be neglected at ultra - high energies .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data for the neutrino sf do not extend to the `` deep sea '' region , i.e. to @xmath20 smaller than 0.001 , and to large @xmath40 .",
    "both these limits , for the electromagnetic structure functions @xmath56 , are subject of debate regarding the presence of possible saturation effects at small @xmath20 and discrepancies in the @xmath40 evolution for large @xmath40 .",

    "parametrizations exist  @xcite that allow for a simplified evolution until very large @xmath40 , while maintaining a soft dependence on the bjorken @xmath20 . as an example we will consider a structure function @xmath62 of the form @xmath63 ( 1-x)^{\\nu(q^2 ) } \\label{n5}\\ ] ] and derive for it an explicit approximate evolution starting from @xmath64 .",
    "the main motivation for our choice of the model is that at small @xmath40 there is similarity between the small-@xmath20 behavior of the structure function and the @xmath50-dependence , @xmath65 , of the hadronic total cross section at high energies .",
    "the alternative approach , with a power behaved dependence , has been discussed in the literature in several publications .",
    "the differences between the two approaches can be significant and will be discussed in section  3 .",
