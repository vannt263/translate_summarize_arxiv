    "we have recently shown that in a rotating , turbulence - free and isothermal gaseous nebula with a density function that maximizes locally , the combined effect of gas drag and pressure gradients at hydrostatic equilibrium , causes solids to migrate toward the locations of local density enhancements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hb03 ) .",
    "the motions of solids in hb03 were restricted to the midplane of the nebula and the variation of the gas density along the direction perpendicular to the midplane was neglected .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations of the dynamics of micron - sized dust grains to 100 meter - sized objects indicated that the radial motions of such solids could be quite rapid when their sizes range from 1 cm to 1 m.    in this paper , we extend our previous analysis to three - dimensional motions and study the radial and vertical migrations of solids subject to gas drag and the gravitational attraction of a solar type star in a non - uniform gaseous nebula .",
    "study of the motions of solids in gaseous mediums has long been of particular interest to astronomers . because of the great diversity in the applicability of the results of such studies , in particular , to the process of formation of planetesimals ,",
    "the literature in this area has become so rich that it makes it virtually impossible to cite all the related articles here . for a short review of the history of such studies",
    "we refer the reader to hb03 and the references therein . of direct relevance to this study , however , are two classic papers by @xcite and @xcite , an article by @xcite on the study of the orbital evolution of solids in a turbulent protostellar disk with application to the formation of icy planetesimals in the outer region of the nebula and a recent paper by @xcite on the radial migration of dust grains in an accreting solar nebula .",
    "our model nebula is turbulence - free and isothermal .",
    "we assume that it consists of pure molecular hydrogen and follows the equation of state of an ideal gas .",
    "an enhancement in the pressure of the gas in such a nebula appears where the density of the gas is locally enhanced . to focus attention on the rate of migration of solids and its dependence on their sizes and physical properties , the density of the nebula is assumed to have an azimuthally symmetric maximum on the midplane . along the vertical axis ,",
    "the gas density changes in a way that the vertical component of the pressure gradients balances the vertical component of the gravitational force of the central star .",
    "the direction of radial motions of solids in our model nebula depends on their initial positions relative to the location of the maximum gas density and their vertical migration is always toward the midplane .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start by explaining our physical model in @xmath0 2 and present the equations of motions of solids in @xmath0 3 . in @xmath0 4 , we present the results of our numerical simulations and in @xmath0 5 , we conclude our study by reviewing the results and discussing their applications .",
    "we consider a rotating , turbulence - free , and isothermal gaseous nebula of pure molecular hydrogen with a sun - like star at its center . at hydrostatic equilibrium and in a cylindrical coordinate system with the star at its origin and the midplane of the nebula as its polar plane , the gravitational attraction of the star at a point with a position vector @xmath1 is related to the pressure gradients of the gas as @xmath2 in @xmath3-direction and @xmath4 along the @xmath5-axis . in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,",

    "the velocity of a solid relative to the gas is equal to @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the velocities of the solid and gas molecules , respectively . in the cylindrical coordinate system considered here , @xmath43 has the following components .",
    "@xmath44 where we have assumed that the gas molecules do not move along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "it is important to mention that it is the @xmath3 and @xmath5 components of @xmath43 that play important roles in the radial and vertical migrations of solids .",
    "they also dominate the magnitude of @xmath43 when the object is small .",
    "the transverse component of the relative velocity , @xmath45 , will have a dominating effect in the magnitude of @xmath43 for larger objects and it plays an important role in changing the angular momenta of such solids which can have significant contributions when accretion is considered .    from equations ( 11 ) to ( 13 ) , the equation of motion of a solid with a unit mass can be written as @xmath46 in equations ( 14 ) to ( 19 ) , the hat sign indicates a dimensionless quantity .",
    "we have followed our convention presented in hb03 and have chosen two quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 to represent the units of length and time , respectively , in such a way that @xmath49 .",
    "the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the dimensionless radial , vertical and angular momenta of the object , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "to start integrating equations ( 14 ) to ( 19 ) , numerically , we take the mass of the central star to be equal to one solar mass and we choose , @xmath54 and @xmath55 g @xmath33 . as in hb03 , the azimuthal symmetry of the gas density on the midplane of our model nebula allows us to set @xmath56 au which implies @xmath48=0.16 years .",
    "an important quantity that has to be determined at the beginning of our integrations is the drag coefficient , @xmath35 . as mentioned in the last section ,",
    "this quantity is a function of the reynolds number of the gas as given by equation ( 9 ) . at the beginning of the integration , the initial functional form of @xmath35",
    "is determined by calculating the initial value of @xmath37 . during the course of integration , the value of @xmath37",
    "is constantly monitored .",
    "once the range of this quantity changes , the integration is continued by adjusting the drag coefficient to its new functional form .",
    "we integrated equations ( 14 ) to ( 19 ) for different values of solids radii and densities and also for different values of the gas temperature . the objects were initially placed on circular orbits at different radial positions .",
    "the initial height @xmath5 of an object was taken to be one - tenth of its initial radial distance and @xmath57 . the initial velocity along the @xmath5-axis",
    "was set equal to zero .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the radial migration of objects with radii ranging from 1 micron to 1 meter .",
    "the densities of the objects are equal to 2 g @xmath33 and the temperature of the gas is 300 k. each object is once placed at ( 2,0.2 ) au with a radial distance larger than the radial location of the density enhancement on the midplane ( i.e. , @xmath58 au ) , and is once placed at a closer radial distance at ( 0.25,0.025 ) au . as expected , all objects migrate radially in / out toward @xmath58 au ( hb03 ) .",
    "smaller objects show the tendency of staying with the gas and undergo very slow radial migrations .",
    "larger objects , on the other hand , show more rapid motions . as in the case of the two - dimensional model ( hb03 )",
    ", a meter - sized object undergoes the most rapid radial migration .",
    "figures 2 and 3 also show that the rate of radial migration is greater for inward motions .",
    "a result that was also observed in two - dimensional simulations of hb03 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the rate of change of angular momentum for an object beyond the radial location of the density enhancement is larger than that of an object in a closer distance to the central star . as a result ,",
    "farther objects lose angular momentum faster , hence , their more rapid radial migration ( see hb03 for more detailed analysis ) .",
    "as mentioned before , as a result of the combined effect of gas drag and pressure gradients , it is expected that objects at radial distances larger than @xmath59 to undergo inward radial migrations",
    ". a closer investigation of the results shown in figures 2 and 3 , however , indicates that at the beginning of their radial motions , objects at @xmath60 au have , briefly , undergone outward migrations .",
    "figure 4 shows this for a millimeter- and a centimeter - sized particle .",
    "such a behavior can be understood by studying the structure of our model nebula . as given by equation ( 5 ) , the maxima of the gas density on planes parallel to the midplane at different heights @xmath5 will appear at different radial distances .",
    "figure 5 shows this for @xmath5 ranging from zero to 0.2 au . in the top graph of this figure",
    "we have plotted the density of the gas as a function of @xmath3 for constant values of @xmath5 . as shown here , the radius of the circular enhancement of the nebula increases from @xmath58 au on the midplane to larger values at higher vertical distances .",
    "the middle and the bottom graphs of figure 5 show the gas density enhancement at @xmath61 0.15 and 0.2 au , respectively . when an object is initially at a radial distance beyond 1 au , depending on its height from the midplane , it may be inside the circle of the local density enhancement at that height . in such cases",
    ", the object starts its radial motion by an outward migration while descending toward the midplane .",
    "once it passes the height where the radial distance of the local maximum density is smaller than its instantaneous radial position , the radial motion of the object reverses and it starts its inward migration .",
    "we also numerically integrated equations ( 14 ) to ( 19 ) for different values of a solid s density .",
    "figure 6 shows the radial migrations of 1 cm and 1 m solids for different values of their densities .",
    "the temperature of the gas is 300 k. similar to the results of two - dimensional simulations ( hb03 ) , increasing the solid s density results in a more rapid radial migration for a centimeter - sized or smaller particle .",
    "however , it has a reverse effect on the motions of meter - sized and larger objects .",
    "such different responses to the change of the density of a solid are the consequences of the contribution of gas drag in changing the rates of its radial migration .",
    "recall that , as mentioned in @xmath0 3 , the radial component of the velocity of an object relative to the gas is the dominant factor in its radial motion . for a centimeter - sized or smaller object",
    ", the magnitude of this component , given by equations ( 11 ) and ( 14 ) , also dominates the magnitude of the relative velocity of the object . increasing the density of an object while keeping its radius constant results in decreasing the magnitude of the drag force @xmath62 given by equation ( 8) .",
    "such a decrease in the magnitude of @xmath62 , in turn , causes the rate of change of the radial component of the relative velocity of the object ( equation [ 17 ] ) to increase , and as a result the object migrates more rapidly .",
    "the situation is not the same for meter - sized and larger objects . in such cases ,",
    "it is the transverse component of @xmath43 ( equation [ 13 ] ) that dominates its magnitude .",
    "that is , as opposed to small particles , the motion of a meter - sized or larger object is dominated by the rate of the change of its angular momentum . because the magnitude of @xmath62 decreases by increasing the solid s density , from equation ( 19 ) , a larger value for @xmath29 results in a smaller rate for the decrease / increase of the angular momentum of the object . in other words ,",
    "an increase of the solid s density will increase its reluctance in loosing / gaining angular momentum and hence a decrease in its rate of inward / outward radial migrations .",
    "numerical integrations were also carried out for different values of the gas temperature . figure",
    "7 shows radial migrations of a centimeter- and a meter - sized object with a density of 2 g @xmath33 for four values of the gas temperature . as shown here , increasing the temperature of the gas results in increasing the rate of radial migration .",
    "this is an expected result which is the consequence of an increase in the radial component of the pressure gradients of the gas .",
    "figure 8 shows this concept in more detail . in this figure , we have plotted the density of the gas as a function of @xmath3 on a plane parallel to the midplane at @xmath63 au . as a result of increasing the temperature of the gas from 50 k to 1000 k ,",
    "the maximum value of the gas density on this plane is increased by three orders of magnitude .",
    "such an increase implies an increase in the radial component of the pressure gradients of the gas which in turn results in more rapid radial migration .    from equation ( 5 ) ,",
    "the radial position of the maximum of the gas density at a certain height @xmath5 approaches smaller values by increasing the gas temperature .",
    "figure 8 shows this for @xmath610.2 au . for an object at this height and at an initial radial position of",
    "@xmath60 au , such a decrease in the radius of the local density enhancement causes the distance of the initial outward migration of the object to become smaller ( figure 7 ) .",
    "for the temperature of 1000 k , the radial location of the maximum gas density at @xmath63 au becomes smaller than 2 au and as a result , an object at ( 2,0.2 ) au does not undergo an initial outward migration .      while the combined effect of pressure gradients and the drag force of the gas causes solids to radially migrate toward the location of local density enhancement , the vertical component of the gravitational force of the central star attracts solids toward the midplane of the nebula .",
    "figure 9 shows the vertical motion of solids with different sizes .",
    "the dependence of the rate of vertical migration on the size of an object can clearly be seen from this figure . as shown here , except for when the objects are in the vicinity of the midplane , the rates of their vertical migrations increase by increasing their radii . in the vicinity of the midplane , however , while 10 centimeter - sized and smaller objects continue their smooth descent , the 1 meter - sized object undergoes an overshoot .",
    "such an overshoot and its corresponding damped oscillatory motion are more pronounced when the density of the object is increased .",
    "figure 10 shows the vertical migrations of a 1 centimeter - sized and a 1 meter - sized object for different values of their densities . as shown here , the rates of vertical descent of both objects increase by increasing their densities .",
    "once in the vicinity of the midplane , the meter - sized object undergoes a damped oscillatory motion whose amplitude increases by increasing the solid s density .",
    "figure 11 shows the three - dimensional paths of these two objects .",
    "the dynamical behavior of an object along the @xmath5-axis and in the vicinity of the midplane can be explained by studying equation ( 18 ) in more detail . in this equation ,",
    "the drag coefficient @xmath64 is the factor that determines the functional form of @xmath65 . substituting for the drag force of the gas from equation ( 8) and for the @xmath5-component of the relative velocity of an object with respect to the gas from equation ( 12 ) , equation ( 18 )",
    "can be written as @xmath66 { { \\hat p}_z}\\,.\\ ] ] in the following we study equation ( 20 ) for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the case of @xmath69 is not studied here since it corresponds to the motions of objects with sizes equal or greater than 100 m. as shown in hb03 , the rates of migrations of such objects due to gas drag and pressure gradient decrease by increasing their sizes . in this paper , we focus our study on rapid migration of small solids .      replacing @xmath71 and @xmath72 by their numerical values and considering spherical solids with masses of @xmath73 , equation ( 20 ) is written as @xmath74}\\ , { t^{1/2}}\\,{{\\hat p}_z},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is in kelvin . in the vicinity of the midplane , @xmath75 and equation ( 21 ) can be simplified to @xmath76}\\ , { t^{1/2}}\\,{\\dot{\\hat z}}+ { { \\hat z}\\over { { \\hat r}^3 } } \\simeq 0.\\ ] ]    equation ( 22 ) resembles the equation of a damped harmonic motion with a dimensionless frequency of @xmath77\\bigr\\}^{-2}}\\,.\\ ] ] equation ( 23 ) indicates that @xmath78 is a function of the solid s radius and density , the gas temperature and also the mean free path of the gas molecules , @xmath31 .",
    "we recall that @xmath31 varies with the gas density as mentioned in @xmath03 .    at any location in the vicinity of the midplane ,",
    "the type of the motion of an object depends on the sign of @xmath78 at that location .",
    "the left column of figure 12 shows the absolute value of the second term of equation ( 23 ) for a centimeter - sized object initially at ( 1.25,0.125 ) au .",
    "we chose @xmath79 cm as a representative of solids with @xmath67 since the results of our numerical integrations indicate that the first sign of a reynolds number larger than unity appears for an object with a radius of 10 cm . since for an object at ( 1.25,0.125 )",
    "au , @xmath80 varies between 0.512 and 1 , the graphs of @xmath81 , as shown in figure 12 , indicate that for a centimeter - sized object , @xmath78 is negative .",
    "a negative value for @xmath78 is an indication of an overdamped motion .",
    "increasing the density of the solid while keeping the gas temperature constant , @xmath78 becomes larger and approaches zero ( critically damped ) indicating that the overdamped nature of the vertical motion of the particle weakens and it may even change into an underdamped motion where @xmath78 is positive .    from equation ( 23 ) , the overdamping nature of the vertical motion becomes even more pronounced when the radius of the object is smaller than 1 cm .",
    "that means , the rate of vertical migration of a solid decreases by decreasing its size ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the left column of figure 12 also shows that for a constant value of the solid s density , increasing the gas temperature results in lower values for @xmath78 .",
    "that means , at higher temperatures , the overdamping of the vertical motion of the object becomes more pronounced ( top graph of figure 13 ) .",
    "this can be explained noting that from equation ( 5 ) and as shown in figure 15 , at any radial distance @xmath3 , the vertical distribution of the gas maximizes at @xmath82 ( i.e. , on the midplane ) . as shown in figure 14 , the width of the gas distribution function along the @xmath5-axis increases by increasing the gas temperature . as a result of this broadening ,",
    "the resistive effect of gas drag on the vertical motion of solids appear in a larger range of variable @xmath5 which results in a longer time for descending toward the midplane .",

    "one can also see from figure 12 that for a constant value of the solid s density , increasing the gas temperature will increase the numerical value of the second term of equation ( 26 ) .",
