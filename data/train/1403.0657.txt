    "the specific expressions of @xmath81 and @xmath123 are different in two distinct regimes ( see the main text ) : ( i ) the regime which was identified as the broken-@xmath0-symmetry phase for a purely optical structure @xcite , characterized by @xmath124 ; ( ii ) the regime with strong inter - cavity coupling @xmath125 , which for a purely optical system , was identified experimentally as the unbroken-@xmath0-symmetry phase @xcite .",
    "we note that only the supermodes with unbroken @xmath0-symmetry can be distributed evenly across the coupled resonators , hence enabling the compensation of loss with gain .",
    "in contrast to this , the @xmath0-broken supermodes become spontaneously localized in either the amplifying or lossy resonator , hence experiencing either net gain or loss ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) .    as fig.s3 shows ,",
    "the phonon lasing action can exist only in the @xmath0-symmetric regime where the optical supermodes are non - degenerate and thus can exchange energy through the phonon mode .",

    "@xcite ; nevertheless , here we show for the first time that the ultralow - threshold phonon lasing can exist only in the unbroken - symmetry regime , not in the broken - symmetry regime .",
    "we stress that , by increasing the optical coupling rate @xmath16 , one can realize the transition from the broken to the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric regimes . that is , realizing not only the exchange of two subsystems ( micro - resonators ) , but also changing the gain to loss and vice versa . by tuning the gain - loss ratio , one can realize the transition from linear to nonlinear regimes , i.e.the giant enhancement of the intracavity field intensity and then the mechanical gain .",
    "both of these two conditions ( strong @xmath16 and @xmath54 ) are required to observe the unidirectional wave propagation in a purely optical system @xcite and now the ultralow - threshold phonon laser in a com system .",
    "it is the presence of active gain which makes it possible to realize these two conditions simultaneously .      finally , we mention that in the vicinity of the gain - loss balance , the stability properties of the com system can also be significantly modified . to see this",
    "we need to study the role of thermal noise on the mechanical response .",
    "this is accomplished by linearizing eqs.(1 - 3 ) and then studying the fluctuations of the operators . with the equations of motion as eqs.(1 - 3 ) in the main text , including also the optical detunings @xmath126 @xmath127 between the two resonators and the input signal laser ,",
    "the mean values of the optical and mechanical modes then satisfy the following equation @xmath128with @xmath129 . from these equations",
    "we can obtain the following polynomial for the input power @xmath32 ,      where @xmath131 denotes the photon number inside the passive resonator . for a passive com system ,",

    "all relevant parameter values are given in the main text , including here also the optical detunings @xmath132 and @xmath133.,width=321 ]    now by applying the expansions : @xmath134 it is straightforward to linearize eqs.(1 - 3 ) to obtain @xmath135 for these fluctuations .",
    "the resulting solutions can be compactly written as @xmath136=\\chi[\\omega]\\,\\delta\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}},\\ ] ] where the susceptibility is in the form @xmath137=m\\left(\\omega^2_m-\\omega^2-i\\omega\\gamma_m + \\frac{2g^2}{m}|a_{2,s}|^2\\mathbf{re}\\mathbb{y}[\\omega]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a cavity factor @xmath138=-\\omega - i\\gamma+gx_s+\\frac{j^2}{\\omega - i\\kappa},\\ ] ] for a thermally - driven system .",
    "hence , by tuning the gain - loss ratio , com properties ( such as the mechanical susceptibility @xcite and the bistability features ) can be significantly modified . as a specific example",
    ", fig.s4 shows the stable and unstable parameter regimes , by applying the routh - hurwitz criterion @xcite .        where @xmath140 .",
    "for @xmath141 , the second inequality is always satisfied . with the help of these conditions ,",
    "the bistability lines can then be plotted by numerically evaluating the polynomial in eq.(s5 ) .",

    ", we include also optical detunings , ignored previously in order to focus on the role of optical gain .",
    "we see that , in general , for stronger input power , bistability appears for higher gain - loss imbalance , as in passive com systems .",
