    "<S> the vertical position of a shower is determined using the centroid method by taking an energy weighted average of the the tower positions : @xmath16 where the sum is over towers in the front part of the fnc , and the weights @xmath17 are functions of the energy deposits , @xmath18 , in each tower . </S>",
    "<S> the weights are chosen to minimize bias and to maximize resolution in the position measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest method of estimating @xmath9 corresponds to choosing weights which are linear in energy , @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> the logarithmic dependence of the @xmath17 more closely matches the true transverse profile of energy deposits in a hadronic shower than the linear dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this estimator is simple , but it has an undetermined free parameter @xmath24 which may be a function of the deposited energy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the optimal value of the cutoff parameter may depend on particle type , electron or hadron .    </S>",
    "<S> the vertical segmentation also allows us to estimate the size of the shower using the rms vertical shower width : @xmath25 since the width of electromagnetic showers is much less than the width of hadronic showers , this estimator enables us to distinguish incident electrons from incident hadrons </S>",
    "<S> . the optimal weights for the width determination are not necessarily the same as those for the position measurement . </S>",
    "<S> since we use the width @xmath26 to separate electromagnetic from hadronic showers , it is most convenient to have an estimator that does not depend on knowledge of the nature of the incident particle . otherwise an iterative procedure must be employed . </S>",
    "<S> as we will discuss in more detail below , linear weights for the shower size measurement give a hadron - electron separation which is close to that obtained with logarithmic weights whose cutoff parameter has been optimized .    </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal position of a shower can be estimated from the division of scintillation light between the left and right sides of the calorimeter : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the effective attenuation length of the scintillator strips , and @xmath29 is the charge from the left(right ) pmt . </S>",
    "<S> if the light attenuation behaves as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 are constants , and @xmath13 is the displacement of the incident particle from the center of the tower , then @xmath14 is independent of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .      </S>",
    "<S> the calorimeter was calibrated with 120 gev electrons incident on the center of each tower . </S>",
    "<S> the high voltage for the tubes in the front was adjusted so that their mean response to 120 gev electrons as measured in the lecroy adcs was 100 pc ( 400 counts ) . after lifting and rotating the calorimeter by 180 degrees to make electrons incident on the rear towers , the high voltage of each rear tube </S>",
    "<S> was set so that the response of the rear section to a muon passing through the calorimeter would approximately equal the response of the front section . since the ratio of the number of front layers to the number of rear layers is 95/39 , the gain is considerably higher in the rear ; however , the energy deposits in the rear for electrons and hadrons are small , so there is no saturation problem for the very high energy particles at hera . </S>",

    "<S> the energy resolution for electrons centered on a tower averaged 33%/@xmath34 independent of tower . </S>",
    "<S> electrons centered in the edge towers had an energy response reduced by 3% due to transverse energy leakage .    </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the energy resolution is degraded to 60%/@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are due to the narrowness of electromagnetic showers compared to the width of the region between strips .    </S>",
    "<S> the small width of the shower compared with the strip width , combined with the reduction in response at the tower boundaries , is responsible for the large bias towards the tower center in the measured electron vertical position shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ crack_pos ] . </S>",
    "<S> the bias grows with increasing cutoff parameter since for sufficiently large @xmath24 only the struck tower contributes to the sums in equations  [ eqn_y ] and  [ eqn_yw ] . </S>",

    "<S> the tower - to - tower average value of @xmath31 was found to be 1.08@xmath36 @xmath37 with a 3% rms spread , corresponding to an average effective attenuation length of 92 cm ; @xmath32 averaged 9.60@xmath38 @xmath39 with a 20% rms spread .    to compare the efficiencies of the wavelength shifting material in the front and rear section we measured the number of photoelectrons collected by the photomultiplier tubes , @xmath40 , which is related to the width , @xmath41 , of the difference distribution by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mean of the sum . by rotating the calorimeter 180 degrees to make electrons incident both front and rear , we found that although in the rear we averaged 92 pe / gev , in the front we obtained only 26 pe / gev . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is due to different wls lengths , wls material , and optical geometry between front and rear , and it worsens the @xmath13 position resolution by a factor of @xmath44 compared to the estimate in section  [ description ] . </S>",
    "<S> photostatistics makes only a small contribution to the energy resolution since , for 120 gev electrons and 26 pe / gev , the fluctuations are only about 2% .      </S>",
    "<S> electron showers penetrate only about an interaction length into the calorimeter . </S>",
    "<S> to refine the calibration constants determined by electrons , 120 gev pions were made incident on the center of each tower . using these data , correction factors were determined which equalized the response of each pmt to hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the correction factors for hadrons were forced to average 1.0 , and had an rms spread of 5% . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of deposited energy for 120 gev hadrons ( pions and protons ) incident on the center of the calorimeter , between towers 5 and 6 , is shown in fig .  [ energy]b . for pions incident in the center of each tower , the average response of the calorimeter </S>",

    "<S> the curves are quadratic in @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> leakage loss is important whenever the beam is outside the four central towers . </S>",
    "<S> when the beam is incident in the center of the calorimeter , between towers 5 and 6 , about 2.5% of the energy is lost compared to the case when the beam is in the center of tower 5 or 6 because of the gap between the scintillator strips ( see inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eofy ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> parameterized as @xmath46 , the energy resolution for hadrons incident at the center of towers 5 and 6 is 0.70/@xmath35 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ptower ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this improves to 0.62/@xmath35 for hadrons incident at the center of the calorimeter , between towers 5 and 6 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results can be compared to the results for electrons discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> the electron to hadron ratio @xmath47 is 0.96 when the beams are incident on the center of a tower , but it falls to about 0.9 when both are incident on the center of the calorimeter in the gap between towers 5 and 6 . for electrons centered on a tower , but hadrons incident on the center of the calorimeter @xmath48 ( see fig .  [ energy ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the electron calibration constants are used instead of the hadron calibration constants , @xmath47 changes by 0.01 . as expected from the ratio of lead to scintillator thickness , the calorimeter is over compensating . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is magnified for electrons by the gap between the scintillator strips ; however , since compared to the electrons the electromagnetic component of a hadronic shower is more spread out transversely , we expect the ` effective ' @xmath47 to be higher .    in order to study energy leakage and position resolution for hadrons , the face of the calorimeter </S>",
    "<S> was scanned with 120 gev pion over an @xmath49 grid . using this grid the effective attenuation length of the scintillator </S>",
    "<S> was determined with hadronic showers . the resulting average attenuation length , 91.9 cm , was in good agreement with the electron scan results .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ ys ] shows the true vertical position of the calorimeter as a function of its position determined using the centroid algorithm with linear weights ( @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the finite strip size is clearly evident in the oscillation superimposed on an average behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , towards the edge of the calorimeter the measured value falls below the true value because of leakage . </S>",
    "<S> the average behavior can be parameterized conveniently as @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the residuals , shown in the upper inset , follow an approximate sine curve with period 5 cm , the tower height .    the overall vertical resolution is determined by plotting the @xmath9 residuals for the centroid algorithm with the polynomial correction for all points of the grid . </S>",
    "<S> the residual distribution is well fit by a sum of two gaussian ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ yres]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the largest component has a weight of 0.91 and an rms width of 0.8 cm for 120 gev pions . </S>",
    "<S> because this width is larger than the size of the oscillation , the @xmath9 position can not be corrected for the oscillation on an event by event basis .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to linear weights , logarithmic weights depend on an arbitrary cutoff parameter @xmath24 which may be chosen to optimize the position resolution , minimizing bias . </S>",
    "<S> residuals for logarithmic weights with @xmath51 are shown in the lower inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ys ] and in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ yres]b . </S>",
    "<S> the bias due to leakage has been considerably reduced ( @xmath52 ) , and the resolution improved , compared with the use of linear weights .    </S>",
    "<S> a measure of the effective overall resolution is @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the variance of gaussian @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is its fractional contribution to the overall distribution . </S>",

    "<S> the best vertical position resolution for 120 gev pions is 8 cm/@xmath35 for @xmath58 , where the curve has a minimum .    like the @xmath9 residuals , the distribution of @xmath13 residuals is also well represented by a sum of two gaussians : 97% with @xmath59 cm/@xmath35 , and 3% with @xmath60 cm/@xmath35 , giving @xmath61 cm/@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution in @xmath13 is much poorer than in @xmath9 ; nevertheless , it is close to the value expected since for 1 gev incident energy @xmath62    the energy response varies over the grid as a result of two competing effects : a ) energy leakage , and b ) light enhancement . as the beam is moved towards the edge of the calorimeter , energy is lost due to leakage , and the measured signal tends to decrease . on the other hand , as the beam moves horizontally away from the center the light collected by the pmts increases because of the characteristic light attenuation of the scintillator strips : @xmath63 the net result is that the signal increases for horizontal displacements at fixed @xmath9 . </S>",

    "<S> a calorimetric measurement with the capability of distinguishing between electromagnetic and hadronic showers is important for physics studies . </S>",
    "<S> because electromagnetic showers are much narrower than hadronic showers , the measurement of the shower width allows a separation of particles by type . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath24 should be chosen to be about 10% for hadrons , but should be close to 0 ( no cutoff ) for electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> the choice of cutoff for the width measurement can be chosen to optimize the separation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers . to estimate the optimal value of @xmath24 we define @xmath65 as a measure of the electron - hadron separation , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the means and standard deviations , respectively , of the width distributions for hadrons ( @xmath68 ) and electrons ( @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all are implicitly functions of the cutoff @xmath24 , so the value of @xmath24 can be chosen to maximize @xmath70 .    </S>",

    "<S> figures  [ ehsep]c and  [ ywidthy]a show that mean and standard deviation of the shower width distribution for hadrons does not change significantly with the incident vertical position . a @xmath26 cut chosen in the range 2 - 4 cm will clearly separate electrons from hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> only 2.3% of hadrons incident at the center of the calorimeter will be lost with a @xmath26 cut of 3.5 cm ; the loss rises to 4.0% for hadrons incident at the center of a strip ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> charged particles , three scintillation counters were placed directly in front of the calorimeter . in addition , only showers near the center of the calorimeter were considered in order to reduce energy leakage . in summary </S>",
    "<S> the data were required to satisfy : @xmath80 where @xmath81 the shower position @xmath14 was determined by light division ; @xmath15 , by the centroid method with logarithmic weights .    the observed energy distribution is shown in fig .  [ neutron ] . </S>",

    "<S> the one pion exchange ( ope ) model of the reaction @xmath82 predicts that the cross section , integrated over scattering angles , is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the flux of virtual pions associated with the incoming proton ; @xmath85 is the total pion - target cross section for a virtual pion beam energy of @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> any dependence of @xmath87 on the virtuality of the exchanged pion has been ignored in equation  [ eqn_ope ] , so @xmath87 can be estimated using a parameterization ( @xmath88 gev ) , or an interpolation table ( @xmath89 gev)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several forms have been postulated for the flux factor @xmath84 in theoretical and phenomenological studies of ope . </S>",

    "<S> the ope prediction is normalized to the data by the number of events . as can be seen , agreement is good for energies larger than 100 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy scale was varied and then compared with the ope prediction for @xmath90 gev by computing the @xmath91 of the difference distribution . </S>",

    "<S> the minimum occurs for a scale factor of 0.985 . </S>",
    "<S> if the regge@xcite form for the flux factor is used instead , the same procedure yields a minimum at 1.003 , in complete agreement with the incident proton beam ; in this case , however , the minimum @xmath91 is worse ( 17 rather than 10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that using charge exchange neutrons the absolute energy scale can be determined to better than 1.5% with the chief source of error being the theoretical uncertainty on the form of the virtual pion flux factor . </S>"
