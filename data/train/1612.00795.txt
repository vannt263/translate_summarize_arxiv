    "susy models are indirectly supported by data in that ( 1 ) the measured values of the three gauge coupling strengths unify in the minimal supersymmetrized standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , ( 2 ) the top - quark mass is measured to lie in the range required by susy to trigger a radiative breakdown of electroweak symmetry  @xcite , and ( 3 ) the measured value of the higgs boson mass  @xcite lies squarely within the range required by the mssm  @xcite .",
    "however , so far no unambiguous signal for superparticles has emerged from lhc searches  @xcite . in the case of the gluino , @xmath18 , ( the spin-@xmath19 superpartner of the gluon ) , recent search results in the context of simplified models place mass limits as high as @xmath20 gev  @xcite for a massless lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , depending on the assumed decay of the gluino .",
