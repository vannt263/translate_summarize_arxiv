    "the single inclusive hadron nuclear suppression factor @xmath0 is defined as the hadron yield in heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions of given centrality , divided by the yield in p - p collisions , scaled with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions occurring in the heavy - ion case , @xmath3 it is by construction unity if there are neither initial nor final state interactions affecting hard quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) processes in a - a collisions .",
    "experimentally , the indication of @xmath4 has been taken as one of the crucial verifications of the collective nature of a - a collisions , as such an observation indicates significant final state interaction of hard partons with hot and dense matter .",
    "results for @xmath0 were the first indication of jet quenching in the rhic era @xcite and among the first reported findings at the start of the lhc heavy - ion program @xcite . unlike at rhic , the first results from lhc showed a strong rise of @xmath0 with @xmath1 with a minimum well below the rhic value . later results from the cms collaboration out to 100 gev @xcite then showed that the rise does not continue but rather appears to level off from about 40 gev onward at a value of @xmath5 .",
    "the strong rise of @xmath0 was unexpected for a number of models which tended to overestimate the expected suppression at the lhc ( e.g. @xcite ) but could be reproduced in others @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 has consequently been recognized as an important tool to distinguish models which yield near - identical results at rhic kinematics @xcite .",
    "there is , however , significantly less information available what physics drives the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 in various models and what particular scenarios are supported or disfavoured by the data .",
    "it is the aim of this work to illustrate the rich combination of various effects leading to the observed @xmath1 dependence at the example of the in - medium shower evolution code yajem @xcite",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , the most general representation of the partonic final state interaction in a hot medium is the medium - modified fragmentation function ( mmff ) @xmath6 , i.e. the distribution of hadrons @xmath7 given a parton @xmath8 with initial energy @xmath9 and initial virtuality @xmath10 where the hadron energy @xmath11 and the parton has traversed a medium along the path @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the medium transport coefficients relevant for the process .",
    "if the mmff can be computed , its convolution with the perturbatively calculable parton spectrum gives the medium - modified hadron yield .",
    "a frequently used simplification in the case of leading hadron observables is the so - called energy loss approximation    @xmath14    where the mmff is replaced by an energy loss probability distribution @xmath15 for the leading parton which is convoluted with the vacuum fragmentation function @xmath16 which only depends on the momentum fraction @xmath17 and the scale at which the process takes place .    using a very simple constant energy loss assumption , a qualitative argument why @xmath0 should generically increase with @xmath1",
    "can be made as follows @xcite : parton spectra in pqcd can be approximated by a power law as @xmath18 where @xmath19 for rhic kinematics and @xmath20 at lhc .",
    "assuming that one can approximate the effect of the medium by the mean value energy loss @xmath21 ( for realistic energy loss models , this is not a good approximation , as fluctuations around the mean turn out to be large ) , the energy loss corresponds to a shift in the parton spectrum prior to fragmentation ( note that this does not correspond to a realistic spacetime picture of the reaction  the uncertainty relation suggests that the scale evolution of the fragmentation function takes place in medium ) .",
    "the shift can be taken into account by the replacement @xmath22 in the expression for the parton spectrum .",
    "@xmath23 can then be approximated by the ratio of the parton spectra before and after energy loss as    @xmath24    and it is easily seen that this expression approaches unity for @xmath25 and that @xmath26 governs how fast this limit is aproached .",
    "in contrast , assuming a constant fractional energy loss @xmath27 leads to a suppression factor independent of @xmath28 in a power law approximation , as    @xmath29    however , in reality the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) parton spectrum is only locally approximated by a power law and the power @xmath26 of a local fit to the spectrum increases with @xmath28 in the kinematically accessible range .",
    "this implies that the constant energy loss scenario approaches unity more slowly for a real spectrum than for a simple power law approximation and that constant fractional energy loss leads to a _ decrease _ of @xmath0 with @xmath1 in the realistic case ( see e.g. @xcite for an explicit calculation ) .",
    "it follows that the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 is always determined from a _ combination _ of parton - medium interaction physics and shape of the primary parton spectrum .      as indicated above",
    ", a more realistic treatment of parton - medium interaction involves computing the mmff . in the following ,",
    "we illustrate the chief additional mechanisms generating @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 using the example of the in - medium shower evolution monte - carlo ( mc ) code yajem @xcite .    in the absence of a medium ,",
    "yajem is identical to the pyshow algorithm @xcite which evolves partons as a series of @xmath30 branchings in the energy fraction @xmath31 and the virtuality @xmath32 with @xmath33 mev , starting from an initial virtuality scale @xmath34 which is given by the momentum scale of the hard process .",
    "this series of branchings terminates at a lower scale @xmath35 , at which point non - perturbative dynamics is assumed to dominate and the lund hadronization model @xcite is used .    in yajem",
    ", it is assumed that the virtuality @xmath36 and energy @xmath37 of any intermediate shower parton @xmath38 is modified by the medium via two transport coeffients , @xmath39 and @xmath40 as    @xmath41    and    @xmath42    as the parton propagates along the path @xmath12 . to evaluate these equations",
    "requires a mapping of the shower evolution of pyshow in momentum space to the hydrodynamical evolution in position space and a model of the transport coefficients as a function of thermodynamical properties of the medium .",
    "the temporal structure of the shower evolution can be parametrically recovered by uncertainty arguments .",
    "the mean lifetime of a virtual parton @xmath43 coming from a parent @xmath38 is hence given as    @xmath44    in the mc simulation of the shower , the actual lifetime is determined from this mean value according to the probability distribution    @xmath45.\\ ] ]    two important observations follow : medium - induced changes of the shower kinematics are not significant if @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) . probing @xmath0 at higher @xmath1 corresponds to probing higher values of the initial virtuality scale @xmath34 and to higher values of parton energies @xmath9 , and thus both the partonic shower evolution as well as the part of the shower evolution in which @xmath46 grow with @xmath1 ( this is the mc shower equivalent of the qcd scale evolution of the fragmentation function ) . as a result , vacuum and on - medium shower evolution become progressively similar at high @xmath1 with the implication @xmath48 ( see @xcite for an explicit computation )  the qcd scale evolution thus has a generic tendency to increase @xmath0 .",
    "at the same time , effects at the lower scale @xmath35 also influence @xmath0 . as eq .",
    "( [ e - lifetime ] ) indicates , at sufficiently high @xmath49 the formation length of a branching eventually exceeds the dimenstions of the medium .",
    "if the medium is characterized by a length scale @xmath50 , the in - medium evolution of the shower will thus proceed only down to a scale @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that for jets with large @xmath49 the intermediate virtuality @xmath52 will never be small while the jet is still in medium and hence @xmath46 will always be realized . in essence , the fact that the length scale for shower evolution can exceed the medium dimensions also implies @xmath48 for sufficiently large @xmath1 @xcite .    while these two mechanisms have been discussed here in the specific context of yajem , they are in fact rather generic .",
    "the lower scale being set by the medium dimensions is a consequence of the uncertainty principle and thus difficult to avoid in any model , while the weakening influence of the medium for longer qcd scale evolution is based on a scale comparison and closely analoguous to the loss of sensitvity to the low @xmath53 non - perturbative parton distributions when an inital scale evolution is carried out to a high virtuality ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "there are yet more effects which shape the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 to some degree .",
    "one of them is the composition of the primary parton spectrum .",
    "since gluons carry a color charge different from quarks and interact with a factor @xmath54 more strongly , gluons also experience stronger medium - induced suppression than quarks",
    ". however , the ratio of quarks to gluons in the pqcd parton spectrum varies as a function of @xmath28 , while the low @xmath28 part is dominated by gluon production , at high @xmath28 quark production takes over . corresponding to this transition",
    ", there is a slight rise in @xmath0 reflecting the lower interaction strength of quarks @xcite .",
    "similarly , while one usually attributes the modification of inclusive hard hadron spectra to the final state interaction with the hot and dense medium which is not present in the case of p - p collisions , there is also a modest change of the initial state comparing p - p with a - a collisions , which is parametrized by the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55-dependence of the npdfs , mapped to a @xmath28 dependence in the parton spectrum after convolution of the initial state parton distributions with the perturbative hard scattering cross section , leads to a non - trivial @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 even in the absence of final state interactions and e.g. a sizable enhancement of a - a over p - p near the kinematic limit @xcite .    in the kinematic range of current lhc measurements of @xmath0 however , both the transition of the dominant parton type and the nuclear initial state effects change @xmath0 by less than 5% , hence we will in the following take the effects consistently into account but not discuss them in further detail .",
    "in order to obtain the medium - modified hadron yield , the mmff must be averaged over the medium geometry . in this work ,",
    "the medium evolution is taken to be a constrained 2 + 1d hydrodynamics evolution , extrapolated from rhic to lhc kinematics using the ekrt model @xcite .",
    "it is of some importance that a realistically evolving medium is utilized as a background , since embedding into e.g. a static background can lead to a core - corona scenario @xcite in which partons inside a certain geometrical region are strongly suppressed whereas partons produced in the corona escape the medium unmodified .",
    "such a geometrical suppression picture can alter the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 @xcite , however this is an unphysical artefact of unrealistic modelling .",
    "the probability density @xmath56 for finding a hard vertex at the transverse position @xmath57 and impact parameter @xmath58 is in leading order pqcd given by the product of the nuclear profile functions as    @xmath59    where the thickness function is given in terms of woods - saxon the nuclear density @xmath60 as @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the standard nuclear overlap function @xmath63 .",
    "if the angle between outgoing parton and the reaction plane is @xmath64 , the path of a given parton through the medium @xmath65 , i.e. its trajectory @xmath12 as a function of proper medium evolution time @xmath66 is determined in an eikonal approximation by its initial position @xmath67 and the angle @xmath64 as @xmath68 where the parton is assumed to move with the speed of light @xmath69 and the @xmath55-direction is chosen to be in the reaction plane .",
    "the transport coefficients used in yajem are then obtained from the hydrodynamical energy density @xmath70 as    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are parameters determining the overall normalization of the coefficients , @xmath74 is the local flow velocity of the medium and @xmath75 is the angle between parton propagation direction and flow direction . in the following , in order to focus on the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 and make the various influences discussed below comparable , @xmath72 is always adjusted such that @xmath0 at 10 gev reproduces the data .",
    "if @xmath76 is the mmff as computed in yajem for the path @xmath12 , then the medium - averaged mmff is obtained as    @xmath77    from this , the medium - modified production of hadrons is obtained from    @xmath78    from where @xmath0 can be obtained .",
    "as discussed above , the mmff is obtained from a partonic shower evolution in medium starting from a virtuality scale @xmath34 and extending down to a scale @xmath51 , followed by a further evolution in vacuum down to the non - perturbative hadronization scale @xmath79 , taken to be 1 gev in the following . in order to study the importance of the evolution of these scales with @xmath1 ,",
    "let us first consider the outcome of a calculation where the scales are held fixed .",
    "using @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 gev , we generate a mmff without scale dependence which is used throughout the kinematic range considered .",
    "since this resulting mmff , once averaged over the medium , retains only a dependence on the fractional momentum @xmath17 , all medium modification is necessarily formulated as function of @xmath17 as well .",
    "the alert reader will realize that this corresponds closely to a constant fractional energy loss scenario in which a _ decrease _ of @xmath0 is expected after folding with a pqcd parton spectrum . as fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] shows , this is indeed the case , resulting in a curve in striking disagreement with the data ( note that the earliest yajem results did not include scale evolution and show this trend @xcite ) .",
    "if the in - medium evolution is not terminated at @xmath82 gev but rather at the scale @xmath51 as dynamically computed given the parton initial position , path and energy in the mc simulation , with the initial scale @xmath34 still held fixed at 30 gev and vacuum evolution carried out between @xmath83 and @xmath79 , the trend reverts to a rise with @xmath1 and reasonable agreement with the data is found .",
    "likewise , if the lower scale is fixed to @xmath82 gev but @xmath34 is allowed to vary with initial parton energy @xmath49 ( corresponding to the usual qcd scale evolution of the fragmentation function ) , the decreasing trend reverts to a rising trend , albeit a weaker one as in the previous case which is not in agreement with the data .    finally , in the realistic case in which both scales are allowed to vary , a strong rise of @xmath0 with @xmath1",
    "is observed , overshooting the data in the region beyond 40 gev ( note that this corresponds to the curve published in @xcite .    while these results establish that the treatment of the shower evolution scales",
    "is a crucial influence on the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 , the outcome that the most realistic evolution scenario overshoots the data is somewhat unsatisfactory .",
    "while the qcd evolution of the mmff in terms of @xmath34 is a concept which is well understood in vacuum qcd , the determination of the lower scale @xmath35 is not on the same level or rigor .",
    "the expression @xmath51 is parametrically set by the uncertainty relation , but this implies that the expression is valid up to a factor @xmath84 and hence begs the question of precisely what @xmath49 and what @xmath50 should be inserted into it .",
    "for instance , rather than estimating the lower scale for the whole jet ( using the shower - initiating parton energy @xmath49 ) we might also the leading subjet based on the argument that we are considering an observable which is predominantly sensitive to the fragmentation of leading partons , and thus what determines the medium - modification of these is only the subjet in which the leading parton is found .",
    "this would argue for a relation @xmath85 with @xmath86 at rhic and @xmath87 at lhc .",
    "likewise , the in - medium distance is typically taken as the distance of the hard reaction vertex to the cooper - frye surface of the hydrodynamically evolving medium .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , there is no compelling reason to use precisely the cooper - frye surface . in the context of fluid dynamics",
    ", the cooper - frye surface is usually taken to be an isothermal surface representing an idealized separation of matter which is interacting so strongly that fluid dynamics is justified and matter interacting so weakly that free streaming is valid .",
    "in contrast , jet - medium interactions do not require medium particles to interact , they merely require the presence of scattering centers , and hard partons would interact also with a free streaming hadronic medium .",
    "this may indicate that a realistic @xmath50 would be somewhat larger than the distance to the cooper - frye surface .    estimating the decoupling of the jet to be on average 20% beyond the cooper - frye surface and taking only the subjet of the leading parton into account results in a plausible scenario with @xmath88 which we explore in fig .",
    "[ f-2 ] .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that using @xmath89 is just enough to compensate the effect of the qcd scale evolution in the kinematic range considered , resulting in a scenario which is in agreement with the data up to 70 gev while still overshooting the last two data points .",
    "thus , within plausible variations of the parametric expression for the lower scale , the realistic computation gives a fair account of the data .",
    "the question remains whether the trend indicated by the data is a plateau at high @xmath1 or not .",
    "there is no easy theoretical argument why @xmath0 should reach a plateau at around 40 - 60 gev .",
    "both upper and lower scale evolution arguments asymptotically imply @xmath48 .",
    "the increasing power @xmath90 of local power law fits to the pqcd spectrum imply also a decreasing sensitivity to parton energy loss at least up to @xmath91 ( beyond phase space restrictions become important @xcite ) .",
    "neither a constant energy loss nor a constant fractional energy loss would thus result in a constant @xmath0 , rather achieving a constant @xmath0 would require fine - tuning of the parton - medium interaction strength to just compensate for the effects from the shape of the parton spectrum and the scale evolutions .",
    "one idea which could provide such a mechanism is the energy dependence of the transport coefficient @xmath39 as suggested in @xcite . in order to explore this idea , we parametrize the result of @xmath92 for a temperature of 400 mev from fig .  9 in @xcite as    @xmath93    ( note that this neglects the temperature dependence of the evolution of the transport coefficient ) and use this expression to compute again hadron @xmath0 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f-3 ] .",
    "the factor @xmath94 2 increase in @xmath39 over the kinematic range leads to better agreement with the data points in the plateau region above 80 gev , however the overall shape agreement between data and calculation worsens ( note again that both curves are normalized to the data at @xmath95 gev ) .",
    "this indicates again that generating a plateau in single inclusive @xmath0 is in essence a fine - tuning problem .",
    "the cms collaboration has also measured the nuclear suppression factor of jets ( defined via clustering with anti-@xmath96 with a radius parameter of @xmath97 ) and observed a result rather independent of @xmath1 in a kinematic region comparable to the parton kinematics underlying the hadronic @xmath0 .",
    "this has been taken as independent confirmation of the existence of a plateau @xcite .",
    "one has to realize however that the physics underlying the suppression of single inclusive hadrons is rather different from the suppression of clustered jets .",
    "fundamentally , jets are much more robust against medium - induced radiation ( or indeed any radiation process ) since close - to - collinear radiation is always clustered back into the jet and only large - angle radiation processes outside the cone radius lead to a suppression of the jet rate @xcite .",
    "there is thus no _ a priori _ reason to expect that the mechanisms discussed above affect jet @xmath0 in the same way .",
    "jet @xmath0 is obtained using the same medium evolution scenario and the same pqcd calculation for the hard process itself as described above and used to compute hadronic @xmath0 . in the following , the parameter @xmath72 describing the overall medium quenching strength ( see eq .",
    "( [ e - qhat ] ) is taken directly from the corresponding hadron suppression scenario and no additional fit procedure for jet @xmath0 is used .",
    "the only difference is that in the following the output of yajem is clustered using the anti-@xmath96 algorithm of the fastjet package to obtain the probability distribution @xmath98 to cluster the shower from a parton with initial energy @xmath9 and virtuality @xmath34 into a jet with energy @xmath99 rather than the mmff .",
    "this probability distribution can then be averaged over the geometry and convoluted with the spectrum in the same way as the mmff .",
    "the different scenarios with upper and lower evolution scale held fixed or determined by the kinematics and spacetime position in the mc event are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f-4 ] in comparison with preliminary cms data @xcite .",
    "a striking difference to fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] is that jet @xmath0 is almost insensitive to the lower evolution scale .",
    "the very purpose of a clustering procedure is however to suppress physics at soft , non - perturbative scales and be sensitive only to hard , perturbative physics , thus such an insensitivity is to be expected .",
    "the remaining @xmath1 dependence is chiefly driven by the pqcd scale evolution , i.e. the initial virtuality scale @xmath34 as well as the fact that with increased jet energy jets become kinematically more and more collimated ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the role of collimation for the dijet imbalance ) , implying that it becomes increasingly difficult to radiate energy out of the jet cone and leading again to a trend @xmath48 asymptotically .",
    "the growth is somewhat slower than in the hadron @xmath0 case .",
    "another crucial observation is that a plateau - like shape with a very weak @xmath1 dependence over the kinematic range considered arises naturally for jet @xmath0 , thus unlike in the hadron @xmath0 case there is no fine - tuning problem , and thus one can not take the lack of strong @xmath1 dependence in jet @xmath0 as an indication that hadronic @xmath0 would level to a plateau .    no attempt to do",
    "a simultaneous global fit of hadron and jet @xmath0 to the data has been made , but it is clear from the results presented here that such a fit would result in a reasonably good agreement between model and data even without novel physics like an additional energy evolution of @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of the nuclear suppression factor @xmath0 is a consequence of a non - trivial interplay of several effects , chief among them the curvature of the primary pqcd spectrum , the scale qcd scale evolution of the mmff and the fact that the in - medium evolution of showers is restricted to a length scale set by the medium size .",
    "subleading effects include the change in dominant parton type with @xmath1 as well as effects from the nuclear initial state .",
    "many of these effects are fairly generic and do not depend on specific assumptions about the nature of parton - medium interaction ( but approximation schemes such as the energy loss approximation dropping the virtuality evolution of the shower in medium have been made in practice ) .",
    "the measured @xmath1 dependence poses significant and non - trivial constraints for models , and in particular identify approximations which can not be safely made ( for instance , dropping the qcd evolution of the mmff is clearly not a justified approximation ) .    within a reasonable parameter space of the precise details of embedding the shower evolution into a hydrodynamically evolving medium , fair agreement of the most realistic modelling case with both the measured single inclusive",
    "hadron and jet @xmath0 can be obtained . however ,",
    "if one interprets the data as exhibiting a @xmath1-independent plateau of suppression beyond 40 gev , then conventional pqcd mechanisms such as the scale evolution and the finite length effect are insufficient to account for the data , and novel physics is required . even in this case ,",
    "@xmath1 independence requires the cancellation of the known @xmath1 dependence of qcd effects and results in essence in a fine - tuning problem .",
    "jet @xmath0 is expected to have a generically weaker @xmath1 dependence and is hence no strong indicator for the presence or absence of a plateau . in this context , it should be kept in mind that no measured p - p baseline at 2,76 gev has been available at high @xmath1 for the cms publication @xcite .    future measurements with higher statistics and higher reach in @xmath1 will reveal if @xmath0 can be completely described by known pqcd effects or if novel physics mechanisms are indicated by the data ."
