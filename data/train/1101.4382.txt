    "arguably , the discovery that black holes should evaporate by emitting a planckian spectrum of particles , is the most important result of combining general relativistic with quantum mechanical notions  @xcite . as it is by now",
    "well known , hawking radiation is a kinematic effect ( that is , does not directly depend on einstein s equations ) , and so , much more general than its incarnation in general relativity . in any phenomenon in nature describable in terms of quantum excitations propagating in a lorentzian geometry with black - hole - like properties ,",
    "one expects to have hawking particle ( or quasi - particle ) production . in  @xcite ,",
    "for example , you can find a catalogue of systems and situations outside the general relativity realm in which hawking radiation is expected to appear . here , by black - hole - like properties we mean either the presence of trapping horizons or just the asymptotic approach towards configurations with horizons  @xcite .",
    "when the lorentzian geometry acquires the form of a stationary black hole , the temperature of hawking radiation becomes constant and proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole at the horizon  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this temperature only depends on this constant , leaving no trace of the history of the black hole geometry formation or preparation  @xcite . in the general relativity realm",
    "that we shall adopt in this paper , this surface gravity and so hawking temperature , happens to be inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole .    when investigating hawking radiation , it is customary to work on a simple static background geometry , namely the schwarzschild solution , neglecting any back - reaction on the geometry . in order to have hawking radiation at infinity ,",
    "it is necessary to set the quantum field in a particular quantum state : the unruh vacuum state  @xcite .",
    "this state is commonly described as being a vacuum state for observers freely falling at the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "it is a stationary state , describing a black hole which has always been and will ever be emitting radiation at hawking temperature at all times .",
    "therefore , it does not capture the process of the black hole formation in general relativity , in which hawking radiation switches on in the last stages of collapse .",
    "instead , in this paper we are going to analyse the characteristics of a different vacuum state , which might be called the collapse vacuum .",
    "this vacuum is appropriately chosen so as to mimic the process of switching on of hawking radiation .",
    "initially , there will be no radiation at infinity , but at some particular time , some radiation will start to be noticeable .",
    "after some rather quick transient regime , this radiation will become thermal with hawking temperature ( as in this paper we are not going to consider the effects of the evaporation , it will not be necessary to distinguish between the terms thermal and planckian , and we will use them indistinctively ) .",
    "our collapse vacuum interpolates between the boulware vacuum state  @xcite at early times and the unruh vacuum state at late times .",
    "it is well known that `` presence of particles '' is an observer - dependent notion  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will be specifically interested in analysing how the collapse vacuum state is perceived by different observers .",
    "in particular , we are going to consider ( i ) static observers at different radial positions of spacetime , ( ii ) observers undergoing a free - fall trajectory from infinity , passing through a fixed radial position at different times , and ( iii ) observers standing at rest at a radial distance until a moment at which they are released to fall freely towards the hole .",
    "a discussion about the different perceptions of the radiation from a black hole in the unruh state by freely - falling and stationary observers can be found in  @xcite .    in order to analyse this particle perception , we could use bogoliubov coefficients  @xcite , but these , except for a few particular simple cases , are difficult to calculate .",
    "instead , we could use the functional schrodinger formalism as in  @xcite , but it appears difficult to manipulate for non - stationary vacuum states . in this paper",
    "we will adopt a different strategy .",
    "following  @xcite , we shall define and calculate a time dependent effective temperature for each observer along its world line .",
    "then , abusing of the language we will describe the perception of the observer as experiencing a thermal radiation wind with a time dependent temperature .",
    "this effective temperature will only be a real temperature in situations in which an additional adiabatic condition is satisfied .",
    "we will also calculate when this condition is satisfied and when it is not . even in the cases in which the adiabatic condition is violated , and therefore the radiation spectrum differs from the planckian shape , it will be argued that the calculated effective temperature is still useful as an estimator of the amount of particles encountered by the observer at each instant of time .",
    "but it is important to remark that in these cases our method can not give information about the characteristics of the spectrum . in any case one",
    "should keep in mind that a precise calculation of the particle perception would require the construction of a particle detector , taking into account its spatial and temporal resolutions .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nonetheless , we will show that the physical image that emerges from our description is rather rich and compelling .",
    "for instance , it will allow us to clearly see that freely - falling observers at the horizon will not perceive vacuum unless ( a ) they closely follow the collapse or ( b ) they have instantaneously zero radial velocity at the horizon .",
    "we will also show that this result is not an artifact of the chosen vacuum , but that it is precisely a characteristic of the final unruh state .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in",
    ", we will start recalling the basic background ingredients needed for our analysis . in",
    ", we will describe and fix the vacuum state for the quantum radiation field of our problem .",
    "then , in , after describing what we mean by effective temperature and adiabatic control functions , we will study in detail the radiation perception associated with the already enumerated different observers .",
    "we will devote to the explanation of one of our most important results : the non - zero perception of radiation by freely - falling observers at the horizon , against the opposite naive expectation .",
    "after a brief comparison of the results with those that one would obtain in a pure unruh state ( ) , we will finally summarize and conclude .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the analysis of radiation emission in a schwarzschild black hole . in units where @xmath0 , the schwarzschild metric reads @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the mass of the black hole .",
    "moreover , we will only use the @xmath3 sector of the geometry . in double null coordinates",
    ", the corresponding @xmath4-metric can be written as @xmath5 here , @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath8      we are going to analyse the behaviour of a quantum field in this spacetime .",
    "for simplicity , we will only consider a klein - gordon massless scalar field ( analyses with other fields would yield qualitatively similar results ) . in this paper , we will only consider spherically symmetric configurations and ignore any backscattering of the scalar field in the geometry , so that our analysis will be equivalent to that in a @xmath4-dimensional conformally invariant theory ( here on , we will stick to a pure @xmath9 analysis ) .",
    "now , the @xmath9 klein - gordon equation in null coordinates reads @xmath10 so that its general solution can be written as @xmath11 owing to the conformal invariance of the @xmath9 klein - gordon equation , any relabelling @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( the subscript ` vs ' in these functions stands for _ vacuum state _ ; the reason for this notation will be understood later on ) can be associated with a mode decomposition of the quantum field of the form @xmath14 , \\label{mode.decomposition}\\ ] ] where the normalized modes in this expression are @xmath15 this can easily be seen by using the following form of the klein - gordon scalar product @xmath16 once the functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 have been defined , one can select a vacuum state @xmath17 by requiring that it satisfies @xmath18 for any other choice @xmath19 , @xmath20 , we can perform an analogue mode decomposition and also define a vacuum state , @xmath21 in general , the vacuum states @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be different .",
    "thus , an observer for which the vacuum is @xmath23 might detect particles corresponding to the vacuum @xmath22 .",
    "the particle content of the vacuum @xmath22 as seen by observers with an unprimed vacuum notion can be calculated through bogoliubov coefficients . in this paper",
    "we will only worry about outgoing radiation , so we will forget about the @xmath24 modes , which correspond to rays going into the black hole .",
    "for each frequency @xmath25 , we have ( see  @xcite ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bogoliubov coefficient defined by the scalar product @xmath28 with @xmath29 defined analogously to  .",
    "plugging the expressions for these modes into  , one arrives at @xmath30 or , integrating by parts the second term , at @xmath31 ( where we have eliminated an irrelevant boundary term ) .",
    "therefore , to determine the particle content , one only needs to know the relation @xmath32 .",
    "we are interested in analysing how hawking radiation is perceived by different observers in spacetime . in order to have hawking radiation in the first place ,",
    "we need to select an appropriate vacuum state . instead of making the obvious choice of the unruh vacuum , we shall choose as vacuum state a non - stationary state which somehow interpolates between the boulware state ( with no radiation at both past and future asymptotic infinities ) at early times and the unruh state at late times .",
    "this dynamical ( or non - stationary ) state in a schwarzschild static background will mimic what happens in a collapse process , in which the black hole is generated from an initially ( almost ) minkowskian spacetime . as opposed to what happens in the unruh vacuum , in this situation hawking radiation",
    "will not be present at early times , but will be switched on at a particular ignition time ( this would correspond to the time of the formation of the black hole ) .    to impose this vacuum state to the quantum field",
    ", we will consider a time - like geodesic observer falling into the schwarzschild black hole from infinity .",
    "we will then calculate how this observer would label in a natural way the different outgoing ( @xmath33 ) rays that he encounters in its way towards the horizon . this new label @xmath34",
    "will then be used to define the vacuum state via a positive - frequency mode expansion , as explained in [ see  ] .",
    "so let us first calculate the radial time - like geodesic trajectories by solving the geodesic equation @xmath35 with this aim we will take into account the relation @xmath36 \\label{metric.deriv}\\ ] ] that follows from the spacetime interval ( equivalently , we could use directly a variational principle for the spacetime interval ) .",
    "here , @xmath37 is the proper time of the trajectory , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the only non - vanishing christoffel symbols relevant for the calculation of radial trajectories , @xmath40 replacing them in the radial geodesic equation yields @xmath41 which has a form resembling newton s gravitational force .",
    "integrating once , we obtain @xmath42 in which we use the radius @xmath43 at which the velocity vanishes as an integration constant . for the time being , we are interested in describing a free - fall trajectory starting at radial infinity , that is , with @xmath44 .",

    "we can also find the behaviour of the time coordinate @xmath50 with respect to @xmath37 . indeed , dividing equations and ( with @xmath44 ) , we obtain @xmath51 which can be integrated to yield @xmath52 , \\label{t.of.r}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is an integration constant . finally ,",
    "replacing the relation   for @xmath54 in this expression , we obtain @xmath55^{1/3 } + \\frac{\\tau_0-\\tau}{4 m } + { \\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\frac{1}{2}}}}}\\ln \\left [ \\frac{(3 ( \\tau_0-\\tau ) / 4m)^{1/3 } - 1}{(3 ( \\tau_0-\\tau ) / 4m)^{1/3 } + 1 } \\right ] \\right\\}. \\label{t.of.tau}\\ ] ] now , having the pair @xmath3 as a function of @xmath37 in   and  , we can also write the quantity @xmath56 in   as a function of @xmath37 , @xmath57^{1/3 } + { \\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\frac{1}{2}}}}}\\left [ \\frac{3 ( \\tau_0-\\tau)}{4 m } \\right]^{2/3 } + \\frac{\\tau_0-\\tau}{4 m } \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ \\left . + \\ln \\left [ \\left(\\frac{3 ( \\tau_0-\\tau)}{4m}\\right)^{1/3 }   - 1 \\right ] \\right\\}. \\label{ub.of.tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an observer following this world line can naturally use its proper time @xmath37 to label the different rays he encounters in its way towards the horizon , namely , he can make the assignment of the label @xmath58 , given by the inverse of , to the ray @xmath33 that hits the observer at proper time @xmath37 .",

    "in this section , we will investigate what is the particle content of the vacuum state defined above for different types of observers , for which the notion of vacuum might or might not coincide with this one . more specifically , we are going to define yet another label @xmath69 associated , in each case , with a specific type of observer .",

    "let us describe now the particle perception of one of these observers throughout its entire life outside the horizon . from the definition of @xmath75 in  , it is easy to see that we can also write @xmath102 then , evaluating the derivatives we can obtain a close form for @xmath75 @xmath103 + 1 \\right\\}^{-4/3}. \\label{kappa.static}\\ ] ] solving numerically the relation @xmath32 from  , we can plot @xmath104 for different static observers ( ) .     for different static observers at @xmath105 ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) [ curves depicted respectively as ( , , , ) ] .",

    "only once the black hole is very close to formation one enters in the asymptotic regime  , and hawking radiation is switched on .",
    "we can estimate when this happen , but for that let us first describe the behaviour of the adiabatic control function in  .      from the definition of @xmath111 in",

    "this late time behaviour is consistent with the fact that then the quantum field is finally switched on , so that the radiation that a static observer sees is perfectly thermal . on the other hand , in the asymptotic past , @xmath111 becomes unbounded , but this does not mean a failure of the adiabatic condition , because @xmath113 there .",
    "again , we can numerically plot @xmath114 for different static positions ( ) .",
    "we can see that its value crushes to nearly zero when the temperature enters its asymptotic regime .     as a function of @xmath115 for different static observers at @xmath105 ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) [ curves depicted respectively as ( , , , ) ] .",
    "we use @xmath110 units . ]",

    "on the one hand , we can define an _ ignition time _ of the black hole as the moment at which @xmath116 .",
    "if one calculates this ignition time in terms of @xmath61 , it does not depend on the value of @xmath81 .",
    "this is perfectly reasonable , as the label @xmath61 corresponds to the single free - fall trajectory used to select the vacuum state .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this ignition time corresponds to @xmath117 , or equivalently to the time when the free - fall trajectory reaches @xmath118 . on the other hand",
    ", we can define a _",
    "thermality time _ as the moment from which the outgoing radiation can be assumed to have a planckian shape .",
    "this thermality time can be calculated in terms of @xmath61 through the condition @xmath119 , meaning that the adiabatic control function has reached a fiduciary value @xmath120 , that here we will take equal to @xmath121 .",
    "this specific condition happens at @xmath122 , which corresponds to the time when the free - fall trajectory reaches @xmath123 .",
    "let us give you some figures .",
    "if a neutron star with 1.5 times the mass of the sun ( schwarzschild radius equal to @xmath124 ) and a radius of @xmath125 started to undergo a free - fall collapse at schwarzschild time @xmath126 , it would reach @xmath127 at a time @xmath128 , and @xmath129 at a time @xmath130 . in this way",
    ", one can directly see that the detection of hawking quanta at infinity does not involve any long delay associated with the freezing of the collapsing structure as it approaches the horizon formation .",
    "finally , let us comment that for different observers the previous two times are seen to happen at different instants of their proper times ( their respective @xmath115 labels ) .",
    "the closer to the horizon , the later the observer will see hawking radiation to switch on and to become planckian .",
    "in this subsection , we will analyse particle creation as seen by observers which are freely falling from infinity . to find the relevant re - labelling @xmath131 ( where ` ffio ' stands for _ falling - from - infinity observer _ ) , we have to use the form of the radial time - like geodesic that starts at spatial infinity with zero velocity",

    "a physical doppler factor has to compare the velocity of the massive objects with the velocity of light , @xmath255 however , note that using @xmath256 coordinates the velocity of light is different from unity ; that is why we have included @xmath257 .",
    "the doppler factor   can be alternatively written as @xmath258 in this way , one would compare the real local velocity of the observer with respect to the local velocity of light ( which is always equal to one ) .",

    "only a hypothetical observer with zero radial velocity at the horizon ( the unruh observer there ) would see a zero @xmath158 , but because of the huge red - shift factor associated to its instantaneous trajectory ( this observer is instantaneously travelling with the null ray ) .",

    "for instance , one just has to approximate the @xmath270 in   for @xmath202 ( this is equivalent to assuming @xmath271 ) , which yields @xmath272\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\   \\times \\left\\{\\left [ \\left(1-\\frac{2m}{r_0}\\right)^{1/2 } + \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{r}}\\left(1-\\frac{r}{r_0}\\right)^{1/2 } \\right ] \\left(\\frac{r}{2m}-1\\right)\\right\\}^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\left[1 -\\left({2 m \\over r}\\right)^2 \\right ] , \\label{kappa.radius.dt.infinity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then see that it is precisely equal to @xmath273^{1/2 } \\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\left [ \\left(1 -{2 m \\over r_0}\\right)^{1/2 } - \\sqrt{2 m \\over r}\\left(1 -{r \\over r_0}\\right)^{1/2 } \\right]^{-1/2}. \\label{kappa.radius.dt.infinity2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with hindsight , we could have used this equality to obtain all the previous partial results .",
    "but we can go now even further : if we put @xmath274 instead of @xmath275 in  , then it is possible to see that we reproduce the entire formula for the effective temperature in  .",
    "this is because between two freely - falling observers at the same position the only difference is a doppler shift , and this fact has nothing to do with being in the unruh state or not .",
    "we checked this first for the unruh state because we wanted to explain the appearance of the final peak in @xmath158 , a peak whose appearance was in apparent contradiction with the vanishing value we expected for that state .",
    "one might worry that some of the results shown in this paper related with the late - time behaviour of the system , are peculiarities of an unusual choice of the vacuum state .",
    "however , this is not the case . in this section",
    ", we will briefly show that at late times this state is really equivalent to the unruh vacuum state .",
    "thus , all the properties found in the previous sections that applies for late times , are immediately present also in the unruh state .",
    "the equivalence between the states for late times can be directly seen from  . in that expression ,",
    "late times means just @xmath276 .",
    "so , as we did in  , we can reverse the approximate relation to find @xmath277 ^ 3 - 1 \\right\\ }   \\nonumber\\\\ \\approx { u_{\\rm h}}- 4 m \\exp \\left[{\\ensuremath{\\frac{1}{4 m } } } \\left({u_{\\rm h}}- 6 m \\right ) \\right ] \\rme^{-{\\bar{u}}/(4m)}. \\label{u.of.ub.future}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but this is precisely the relation which defines the coordinate @xmath61 that appears in the unruh modes  @xcite ( apart from the irrelevant origin of the coordinates ) .",
    "thus , if we are using this coordinate to define the vacuum state , we are in fact choosing the unruh state for late times .    nonetheless , just as an example",
    ", let us perform a specific calculation entirely based in the unruh state choice .",
    "for instance , let us calculate the case of a freely - falling observer from infinity . with this aim ,",
    "consider a redefinition of @xmath61 using the usual and simple form @xmath278 and take   as the definition of @xmath115 .",
    "that is , @xmath61 defines the vacuum and is the coordinate that appears in the unruh modes ; and @xmath115 is the proper time that a freely - falling observer from infinity uses to label the rays . replacing   in",
    "we obtain a relation @xmath32 , from which we can directly compute @xmath75 .",
    "the result is @xmath279^{-1/3 } + 2 \\left [ \\frac{3}{4 m } \\left({u_{\\rm h}}- u \\right ) + 1 \\right]^{-2/3 } + 1 \\right\\}. \\label{kappa.unruh.state}\\ ] ]    from here one can check the limits @xmath280 with the naked eye .",
    "the first limit is the usual hawking radiation temperature , which in the unruh state is always present , even at the asymptotic past .",
    "it is as if we extended the plateau to the @xmath92 limit ( see ) .",
    "the second limit is equal to the one obtained at the horizon crossing for long enough delays in [ see  ] , and also for far enough releasing radius in [ see  ] .",
    "thus , the final peak in the temperature is not something coming from an eccentric selection of the state : it is a characteristic of the unruh state .     for a freely - falling observer from infinity in the unruh state .",
    "we use @xmath110 units and @xmath154 . ]",
    "in this paper we have considered a quantum scalar field over a schwarzschild black hole geometry . as a first step ,",
    "we have set up the quantum scalar field in a specific vacuum state that interpolates between boulware vacuum state at early times and unruh vacuum state at late times .",
    "in other words , we have chosen a non - stationary vacuum state so that it simulates the physics of a dynamical collapse scenario . in this scenario , before the black hole forms there is no radiation at infinity but , after its formation , observers at infinity start receiving a hawking flux of radiation : the black hole hawking emission switches on at some particular ignition time ( of course , it is not an instantaneous event ) .",
    "this vacuum state has been fixed by requiring that a reference observer freely falling from infinity detects no radiation .    as a second step",
    ", we have analysed the radiation associated with this vacuum state in terms of how it is perceived by different observers : static observers at a fixed radius ; freely - falling observers from infinity , with different time delays with respect to the reference observer ; and observers maintained at a fix radius for some time , and then , after being surpassed by the reference observer in its way in , released to fall freely towards the horizon at different releasing times .",
    "the method used follows the recent analysis in  @xcite . for each observer",
    "we define a function @xmath158 varying along the observer s trajectory .",
    "we also define an adiabatic control function @xmath111 as @xmath281 . in the portions of the trajectory",
    "in which @xmath158 stays almost constant ( @xmath164 ) one can be sure that the observer detects thermal radiation at a slowly varying temperature @xmath282 .",
    "when this is not exactly the case , the radiation perceived is non - thermal , but still , we take the value of @xmath158 as an estimate of the amount of perceived radiation and , somewhat abusing of the language , we talk about a time varying effective temperature .    * _ static observers at fixed radius .",
    "_ we show that they perceived an effective temperature that starts from zero , at early times , and after a transient period , stabilizes at hawking s temperature @xmath283 multiplied by the gravitational blue - shift factor associated with the particular radial position of the observer .",
    "this description clearly reflects the _ ignition _ associated with the formation of a black hole we were seeking for .",
    "we also see that the transient period is quite sort : @xmath284 for a collapsing neutron star with 1.5 times the mass of the sun and a radius of @xmath125 , when detected from far enough positions .",
    "observers closer to the horizon will perceive this process with a slower pace due to the gravitational slow down of their clocks . * _ observers freely falling from infinity .",
    "_ when their delay with respect to the reference trajectory used to fix the vacuum state is small , they perceive almost no radiation at all . the physical picture is the following : if an observer sitting at the very surface of a star that is collapsing in free fall to form a black hole perceived vacuum at the beginning of the collapse , he would perceive vacuum during his entire collapsing trajectory ( this is reasonable , as he has not perceived any gravitational field ) .",
    "+ on the contrary , when the delay is long enough , the observer has time enough to see that the black hole is emitting hawking radiation .",
    "he first sees the switching on of this radiation .",
    "then , during some time he perceives an almost constant temperature radiation passing by .",
    "the temperature at this plateau is essentially the result of multiplying hawking s temperature by a doppler shift factor associated with the velocity of the observer . in this region",
    "the adiabatic condition is perfectly satisfied , so here to describe the perceived radiation as having a temperature is strictly correct . finally , in the last stages of his approach to the horizon , and surprisingly at first sight",
    ", the effective temperature rises reaching exactly four times hawking s temperature .",
    "the adiabatic condition is only mildly violated in these last stages , so although the perceived radiation is not exactly planckian , it is not hugely different from planckian either .",
    "* _ observers freely falling from a radius . _",
    "these observers are standing still at a fix radial distance @xmath165 from the horizon ( supporting themselves against the gravitational pull with some rockets ) till a release time ( when the rockets are switched off ) , which happens some waiting time after the reference observer , in free fall , has overtaken them .",
    "if this waiting time is long enough , the observers will see hawking radiation appear and settle down to a constant value , right in the same way as described above for static observers .",
    "once the observer is released , the value of the effective temperature undergoes a jump with a value equal to the surface gravity associated with position @xmath165 times the gravitational blue - shift factor associated with this same position .",
    "we calculated the value of the effective temperature after the release and called it @xmath285 . from the release time on , the effective temperature starts to rise , first slowly and later quicker , so as to reach a finite value at horizon crossing .",
    "the precise behaviour of the effective temperature depends on the release radius , and so does the asymptotic value of it , which becomes @xmath286 when @xmath205 .",
    "once hawking radiation is switched on , the value of @xmath287 , that is , the effective temperature as perceived by an observer freely falling at @xmath194 and with a vanishing instantaneous radial speed , interpolates from @xmath288 when @xmath289 to zero when @xmath290 .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the unruh state is vacuum for freely falling observers at the horizon .",
    "however , in general one has to be careful with this assertion .",
    "we have shown that after hawking radiation is switched on , generic freely - falling observers at the horizon _ do not perceive vacuum , but a finite effective temperature higher than their initial unruh effective temperature_. the reason is that the unruh observer experiences a doppler red - shift factor with respect to a generic observer ( due to their velocity difference ) , or in other words , a generic observer experiences a doppler blue - shift factor with the respect to the unruh observer .",
    "this doppler blue - shift factor diverges at the horizon in such a way that , when multiplied by the vanishing value of unruh s temperature at the horizon , results in a finite temperature for a generic observer .",
    "in fact , we have proved the following completely general result : for any freely - falling observer the exact effective temperature @xmath291 perceived at position @xmath194 is precisely the product of the temperature when released there @xmath292 by the doppler blue - shift factor associated with the radial velocity of the observer when passing through that position .    regarding the observability of hawking radiation , in pure theoretical terms the discussed results lead to the idea that the closer to the horizon one supports oneself against gravity , the better the chances of detecting its radiation , due to the gravitational blue - shift factor .",
    "however , in practical astrophysical scenarios the tiny hawking temperature of a stellar mass black hole , about a few nano - kelvins , will be masked by the @xmath293 kelvin of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this radiation would also experience a gravitational blue shift if detected by observers close to the horizon , so that going closer to the horizon would not improve in principle the chances of detection .",
    "another matter is the detection of hawking radiation in analogue models of general relativity .",
    "there exist quantum systems , as bose - einstein condensates , in which hawking temperature is not that much masked by the environment temperature . in",
    "those situations one could think that analysing the presence of radiation close to the horizon would improve the detection chances , but this is not that clear . these systems exhibit modified dispersion relations so that when blue shifting the modes , they would enter into the non - relativistic regime , behaving very differently to what has been found and discussed in this paper .",
    "in addition , the size of the entire system in the lab will be so small that to control the physics localized close to horizon , a tiny fraction of the total size of the system , seems implausible .",
    "other ways of detection that could prove better are the so called correlation measurements between outgoing and ingoing partners of the hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "let us finish the paper by mentioning that the results presented here will also constitute an adequate preparatory background material for a future work dealing with analyses of buoyancy over black hole horizons .    the authors want to thank s. finazzi , s. liberati , s. sonego and m. visser for enlightening comments during the elaboration of this paper .",
