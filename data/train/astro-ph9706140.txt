    "ngc 1068 is perhaps the ideal benchmark for studying gas composition in active galaxies .",
    "its proximity , high luminosity and inclination make spectroscopic studies easier than in most known seyferts . as a result ,",
    "the available spectroscopic information is of unusual quality and coverage .",
    "the optical and uv spectrum have been studied in numerous papers ( snijderes , netzer & boksenber ; 1986 , and references therein ) and the extreme uv spectrum has been observed by hut ( kriss  1992 and this volume ) .",
    "dozens of emission lines have been measured and soon to be published papers will include the first attempt at high spatial resolution long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "this will provide line ratios in regions of different levels of ionization and will enable a meaningful comparison with multi - component models .",
    "the x - ray information on this source is even more remarkable .",
    "bbxrt ( marshall  1993 ) and asca ( ueno  1994 ) observations revealed the presence of several strong x - ray lines .",
    "the iron  complex is clearly split into three components ( marshall 1993 ) , suggesting the presence of highly ionized x - ray heated gas .",
    "there is also evidence for several soft x - ray lines with equivalent width of at least 50100 ev .",
    "this is the first and best evidence for soft x - ray lines in any agn .",
    "the anlysis of the x - ray lines can be used to put limits on the fe / o abundance ratio .",
    "the complimentary information from uv studies provides limits on o / n and o / c .",
    "this paper discusses the gas composition in ngc 1068 .",
    "the x - ray aspects are reviewed in  2 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the uv spectrum is given in  3 with emphasis on recent hst and hut observations .",
    " 4 summarizes the most important findings of this work .",
    "the most detailed x - ray investigations of ngc  1068 are by marshall  ( 1993 ) and ueno  ( 1994 ) .",
    "previous ginga observations are described by awaki  ( 1990 ) and rosat imaging is described in wilson  ( 1992 ) .",
    "the analysis of the bbxrt data , by marshall  ( 1993 ) , suggests two different components that contribute to the iron  complex .",
    "1 . a `` warm '' component , with a temperature of about @xmath3k , which produces the 6.4 kev line",
    ". this gas is photoionized by the nuclear source and is also the `` mirror '' reflecting the optical - uv continuum and the broad balmer lines .",
    "2 . a hot , @xmath4k component , producing the  and  lines . according to marshall , the two contributes about equally to the scattered 6.4 continuum .",
    "a different combination of components is suggested by iwasawa  ( 1997 ) . in their scheme ,",
    "the 6.4 kev line is due to a compton thick gas , with very large column density , presumably the thick walls of the central torus .",
    "iwasawa   suggested also a second , hot component to explain the highly ionized iron lines . in their model ,",
    "the scattered 6.4 kev continuum is mostly due to the compton - thick gas and there is no explanation of the `` mirror '' .",
    "marshall  ( 1993 ) reported an upper limit on the   line which indicates a large oxygen under abundance .",
    "the most significant comparison is with iron since the observed  lines enables a simple determination of fe / h . the analysis suggests an iron over abundance , relative to solar , by a factor of 23 and oxygen under abundance by a factor of 35 .",
    "ueno ( 1994 ) confirmed the upper limit on the  line and the bbxrt measurements of the  lines .",
    "they assumed that most of the soft x - ray flux is from hot , collisionally excited plasma , in which all metals are highly depleted .",
    "netzer and turner ( 1997 ) reanalyzed the asca data .",
    "they measured several soft x - ray lines , such as , , h - like and helium like lines of magnesium , silicon , sulphur and argon , and several fe - l lines , and confirmed the two - component model .",
    "marshall  ( 1993 ) have also examined the uv spectrum of ngc  1068 and suggested more evidence for the small o / h .",
    "the observed optical -uv spectrum of ngc  1068 is described in snijders  ( 1986 ) .",
    "more recent , shorter wavelength ( 9001800 ) observations by hut are reported in kriss  ( 1992 ; see also g. kriss contribution in this volume ) .",
    "all large aperture data represent the spectrum over a region of roughly 20 arc - sec in diameter .",
    "the high resolution hst imaging , such as the one presented in this meeting ( e.g.z . tsvetanov contribution ) , clearly emphasize the limitation of large aperture observations .",
    "the hst archive contains some high spatial resolution spectroscopy of this galaxy .",
    "we have used one such unpublished data set , obtained by centering on an off - nucleus cloud , to try and separate the high and the low excitation lines . our line list ( table 1 ) is an average of several sources designed to represent an average ionization cloud .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  1068 indicates a substantial amout of reddening .",
    "snijders  ( 1986 ) used a galactic type extinction and estimated e@xmath5 mag .",
    ", mostly from the /  line ratio .",
    "the more recent hut observations of kriss   ( 1992 ) discovered two helium lines ,  and .",
    "their ratio , relative to , is inconsistent with a single extinction law .",
    "this has been discussed , extensively , by kriss  ( 1992 ) and ferguson  ( 1995 ) .",
    "ferguson  ( 1995 ) suggested a double reddening correction approach in which all lines with wavelength longer than 1640were corrected with one extinction curve and all lines with shorter wavelength were corrected with a different curve .",
    "unfortunately , there was a mistake in applying this procedure to the data ( ferguson , private communication ) and the reddening corrected line intensities in their table 1 are erroneous .",
    "the difficulty encountered by kriss  ( 1992 ) and ferguson  ( 1995 ) is due to the inconsistency in the observed flux of three heii lines at 4686 , 1640 and 1084 .",
    "the line intensities are predicted by simple recombination theory and are very reliable reddening indicators .",
    "ferguson  noted that continuum fluorescence ( the absorption of continuum photons by resonance lines ) can contribute significantly to several of the observed uv transitions .",
    "they have shown that the  and  intensities can considerably increase due to this process .",
    "our new calculations support this claim .",
    "they also show that   is significantly affected by this process . when including continuum fluorescence in the calculations of this line , with velocity broadening of 500 , we find that this can explain up to 50% of the observed 1084  flux .",
    "this cures the reddening anomaly and enables a single , self consistent reddening solution with a galactic - type extinction .",
    "we further note that some other lines can significantly be affected by continuum fluorescence .",
    "in particular , in large column density situations , there can be a large contribution at 1304 , 1039 , 1026 , 990 , 976 , and 972 , from oi resonance lines .",
    "some of the observed flux at around 1035 , 977  and 990 , can be due to this process , although the absence of a strong 1304  is problematic .",
    "examples are shown in table 1 .",
    "table 1 lists dereddened line ratios assuming galactic - type extinction and e@xmath6 mag .",
    "the calculated contributions to the 1084  feature , suggests this to be the most reliable reddening estimate .",
    "the listed uncertainties on the dereddened line intensities represent the 2@xmath7 intervals , as given in the original papers , without taking into account the uncertainty in reddening .",
    "the listed intensity of  has no assigned uncertainty due to the blending under geocoronal .",
    ".observed and calculated line intensities [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have used the photoionization code ion ( netzer 1996 and references therein ) to carry out extensive photoionization modeling of the nlr gas in ngc  1068 .",
    "we have assumed various densities and column densities , different geometries and dust distribution and allowed for abundance variations .",
    "the line list presented in table 1 is used for comparison and we have tried splitting it into high and low excitation lines to test the quality of the fit .",
    "two single component models are shown in the table .",
    "they have similar ionization parameter , density and column density , and differ by the assume amount of internal dust .",
    "the assumed turbulent velocity is 500 .",
    "the continuum used for the calculation is similar to the one used by marshall  ( 1993 ) , except for the soft x - ray part .",
    "it is made of a broken power - law with typical optical - uv slope and = 1.35 .",
    "this fits best with the overall energy budget as well as the observed hard x - ray flux .",
    "the main uncertainty is due to the shape of the unobserved uv bump . as argued by wilson  ( 1992 ) , there is a likely strong soft - x - ray contribution from an extended source , presumably a starburst region .",
    "this implies a weaker soft x - ray central source , compared with the one used in marshall .",
    "we have considered this possibility and have assumed a hard ( f@xmath8 ) x - ray continuum extending from 1 to 50 kev , normalized to the observed flux at 6.4 kev .",
    "the 1 kev point was connected to the lower energy continuum used by marshall .",
    "in anticipation of the unusual composition , and in accord with the x - ray analysis , we have modeled the nlr gas with he / h=0.1 and the following dust - free composition : + h : c : n : o : ne : mg : si : s : ar : fe= @xmath9:3:1:1.5:1:0.33:0.33:0.16:0.07:1.2 . + for the dusty nlr we have assumed gas phase composition of + h : c : n : o : ne : mg : si : s : ar : fe= @xmath9:1.6:1:1.5:0.6:0.16:0.016:0.054:0.016:0.016 .    imaging of ngc  1068 , through various narrow band filters ,",
    "clearly show ionization stratification .",
    "thus single component models , like the ones shown in the table , with `` mean ''",
    "properties , are poor representations of the more complex physical situation .",
    "the emphasis in this work is on the gas composition , and we do not list most of the calculated models .",
    "we also point out that the derived e@xmath10 is more appropriate to the high ionization component , since it is based on heii line ratios .",
    "any composite model must take into account the possibility that the high and the low ionization lines are affected in a different way by internal dust .",
    "in particular , internal dust is more important in high ionization parameter environment ( e.g. laor and netzer , 1993 ) .",
    "for example , in dusty models with much larger ionization parameter , the heii line ratio is affected too .",
    "however , the derived o / n and o / c abundance ratios ( see below ) are hardly affected .",
    "a key issue in the present study is the abundance of iron and oxygen .",
    "the iron abundance can be obtained from x - ray modeling since the equivalent width of the strong  lines is a direct measure of fe / h .",
    "the oxygen abundance can be determined by comparing oxygen , nitrogen and carbon emission lines . as argued by shields ( 1976 ) ,",
    "several ultraviolet semi - forbidden lines can be used in this analysis because of their similar excitation and level of ionization .",
    "the line ratios most suitable for our purpose are /  and /.",
    "the ionization structure of a gas cloud exposed to a typical agn ionizing continuum shows a large overlap of the c@xmath11 , n@xmath11 and o@xmath11 ionization regions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 1 for the assumed ngc  1068 continuum .",
    "given the similar ionization structure , we can use the observed line ratios , to deduce relative abundances .",
    "the theoretical ratios are @xmath12}\\lambda1663   ) } { { \\rm i(n iii]}\\lambda1750   ) } =       0.41 { \\rm t_4^{-0.04 } } \\exp ( -0.43/{\\rm t_4 } )          \\frac { { \\rm n(o^{+2 } ) } } { { \\rm n(n^{+2 } ) } } \\ ] ] and @xmath12}\\lambda1663   ) } { { \\rm i(c iii]}\\lambda1909   ) } =       0.15 { \\rm t_4^{0.06 } } \\exp ( -1.11/{\\rm t_4 } )          \\frac { { \\rm n(o^{+2 } ) } } { { \\rm n(c^{+2 } ) } } \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the temperature in units of 10@xmath14k .",
    "we further assume ( fig .",
    "1 ) that n(o)/n(n)@xmath15 and n(o)/n(c)@xmath16 .",
    "the observed intensities ( table 1 ) , combined with a typical @xmath13=1.5 , gives n(o)/n(n)=@xmath17 and and n(o)/n(c)=@xmath18 .",
    "these ratios are much below the solar values and confirm the large oxygen under abundance in this source .",
    "metal depletion on grains can not provide an explanation to this ratio unless the gas and dust composition are vastly different from their ism values .",
    "analysis of the composite spectrum of ngc  1068 clearly demonstrates the unusual oxygen line ratios .",
    "the examples shown in this work suggest that the nlr gas has extremely low oxygen abundance .",
    "the models listed in table 1 are not intended to represent the full physical conditions , only to demostrate the more important processes .",
    "they confirm the need for large turbulent motions ( ferguson ; 1995 ) and eliminate much of the problem raised by kriss  regarding the intensity of  and .",
    "they fall short of explaining the strong  and  lines and suggest that higher ionization components , perhaps of optically thin gas , may be important . in summary ,",
    "future models of ngc  1068 must take into account the following :    1 .",
    "the ionized gas is stratified and regions of different excitation must be combined in order to mimic the observed large aperture spectrum .",
    "2 .   large turbulent motions make continuum fluorescence an important process and can significantly increases the intensity of various resonance lines .",
    "this helps to explain the strong  and  lines ( ferguson ; 1995 ) , the anomalous 1084  feature ( this work ) and perhaps the strength of some ultraviolet oi lines ( this work ) .",
    "the process is likely to be more important in seyfert 2s , where the central continuum is obscured from direct view .",
    "when taking into account the  line , there is a good agreement with a single galactic - type extinction law , with e@xmath19 mag .",
    "dust mixed with the nlr gas is likely to be important in the nlr .",
    "the absence of the  line suggests oxygen under abundance , compared with nitrogen and carbon .",
    "this is in line with indications from x - ray ( netzer and turner ; 1997 ) and millimeter ( sternberg , genzel & tacconi ; 1994 ) observations .",
    "it is interesting to note the intensity of this line in other seyfert galaxies .",
    "is clearly observed in both ngc  4151 ( ulrich 1985 ) and ngc  5548 ( crenshaw  1993 ) during times when the broad emission lines are weak .",
    "the line is also observed in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  5525 ( tsvetanov , in preparation ) where it is stronger than . in all these cases , there are indications for solar o / c and o / n .",
    "finally , our recent hst study of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  3393 ( cooke ; 1997 ) does not show the  line .",
    "however , the fos spectrum is of moderate quality and the observed intensity is consistent with solar o / c and o / n .",
