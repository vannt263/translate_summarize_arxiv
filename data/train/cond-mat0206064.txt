    "[ fig : phasej0 ] well .",
    "there are several remarkable features in this phase diagram .",

    "an important point to be noted is that when @xmath69 the metallic state is remarkably stable against a transition to the insulator , and persists up to fairly large coulomb interactions .",
    "moreover , it becomes immediately unstable , once the parameters are away from the line @xmath78 .",
    "this tendency becomes more conspicuous in the regime of strong correlations .",
    "these remarkable properties about the metallic phase around the line @xmath78 are closely related to orbital fluctuations , as we will see momentarily in the following .",
    "the second point is that there are two insulating phases corresponding to the regions @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which are separated by the metallic phase for small @xmath81 , but are continuously connected to each other via the region of large @xmath81 .",
    "for example , let us observe phase transitions with @xmath82 being fixed . when @xmath83 with @xmath82 , the system is in the insulating phase caused by the intra - band interaction @xmath12 . introducing the interband coupling @xmath13",
    ", a phase transition occurs to the metallic phase , and further increase in @xmath13 induces the second transition to another insulating phase , which is dominated by the inter - band interaction @xmath13 .",
    "these two insulating phases should show different properties , though they can be adiabatically connected to each other in principle .      to clarify the above characteristic properties around the metal - insulator transition , we exploit a linearized version of dmft,@xcite which provides us with a transparent view of the phase transitions . in this scheme ,",
    "we introduce a specific anderson impurity model connected to only _",

    ", which corresponds to the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : and ] ) with @xmath84 .",
    "this extreme simplification even provides sensible results as far as low - energy properties near the transition point are concerned .",
    "namely , for low - energy excitations around the fermi surface , the green function for @xmath85-electrons may be approximated by a single pole as , @xmath86 where the residue @xmath87 corresponds to the quasi - particle weight .",
    "recall that for @xmath88 the ground state belongs to an insulating phase , while for @xmath89 to a metallic phase .",
    "we can thus determine the metal - insulator transition point from the condition @xmath88 , as has been done before .",
    "-4 mm    by combining the self - consistent eqs .",
    "( [ eq : self1 ] ) and ( [ eq : self2 ] ) , we iterate the linearized dmft .",
    "the self - consistent condition imposed on the hybridization now reads @xmath90 for the single - band hubbard model ( @xmath72 ) , the critical value @xmath91 was already estimated by the linearized dmft.@xcite    in this simplified model , the metallic ground state is in the spin singlet state drawn in fig . [",
    "fig : ponch ] ( a ) schematically .",
    "although the introduction of the interband coulomb interaction @xmath13 lowers the states ( b ) and ( c ) energetically , these states do not affect the ground - state properties up to a certain critical value of @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the relevant excitation gap is independent of @xmath13 in this approximation , and the residue of the green function around @xmath92 is given as , @xmath93 via a straightforward calculation .",
    "then the self - consistent eq .",
    "( [ eq : iter ] ) updates the hybridization via @xmath94 in each iteration process .",
    "therefore , when @xmath95 , the effective hybridization @xmath96 vanishes by the iteration , thereby stabilizing the insulating phase in this region .",
    "on the other hand , the hybridization is relevant for @xmath97 and thus the metallic phase is realized .",
    "note that the critical value @xmath91 obtained here is the same as that for the single - band hubbard model.@xcite we thus come to the conclusion that the inter - band coulomb interaction has little effect on the metal - insulator transition , which is essentially described by the mechanism for the single - band hubbard model , as far as the case of @xmath98 is concerned .",
    "this statement is indeed consistent with the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasej0 ] , namely , the phase boundary is rather insensitive to the change in @xmath13 for small @xmath13 .    on the other hand , in the special case @xmath78",
    ", the nature of the transition is totally changed in this approximation . in this case , the ground state is formed by three degenerate states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ponch ] , and not only spin but also orbital degrees of freedom play an important role .",
    "in fact , quantum fluctuations among these states decrease the effective mass , making the metallic phase more stable .",
    "the critical value @xmath99 estimated by the present scheme agrees with the numerical one in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasej0 ] .",
    "also this is consistent with the conclusion of quantum monte carlo simulations,@xcite which claims that the ground state in the single ( double ) orbital hubbard model belongs to the insulating ( metallic ) phase in the case @xmath100 .",
    "the present analysis also gives a clear picture for two types of the metal - insulator transitions : the insulating phase in the upper region of in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasej0 ] corresponds to the state of fig .",
    "[ fig : ponch](a ) , where the intra - atomic repulsion gives rise to the insulating phase , whereas the insulator in the lower region , corresponding to fig .",

    "is realized by the competition among almost degenerate singlet states ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) . in other words ,",
    "the metallic state is stabilized by orbital fluctuations .",
    "we now discuss the effects of the exchange coupling @xmath14 between orbitals , which plays an important role in real materials such as manganites and ruthenates . by performing similar calculations",

    "the inter - band coulomb interaction dominates electron correlations in the ground state when @xmath70 , which is schematically drawn as fig .",
    "[ fig : ponch ] ( b ) or ( c ) . for these configurations",
    "the hund coupling is irrelevant , which explains that the effect of @xmath14 is less important for @xmath80 .     and",

    "fluctuations between the orbitals are enhanced , which assist to stabilize the quasi - particle states up to @xmath107 .",
    "further increase in @xmath13 favors the doubly occupied state in the same orbital .",
    "therefore , the electron states around the fermi surface are pushed away to higher energy regions , as seen in the case of @xmath108 , and finally a quantum phase transition occurs from the metallic phase to the insulating phase . in the insulating phase for @xmath109 , we can clearly see the charge gap in the density of states in fig .",

    "this difference is explained by counting the number of effective degrees of freedom at each site in the presence of the exchange coupling . in the ferromagnetic case , the system has a tendency to form the @xmath112 state at each site , while in the antiferromagnetic case it favors the singlet state made of two orbitals .",
    "the resulting effective degrees of freedom give rise to the difference in the stability of the fermi liquid state : the metallic state with the ferromagnetic coupling is more stable than the antiferromagnetic case .",
