    "casimir interactions are macroscopic manifestations of the vacuum zero - point energy brought about by introduction of boundaries or changes in the topology of space .",
    "these modify the spectrum of zero - point fluctuations from their form for free space , which gives rise to experimentally detectable forces @xcite . although originally derived as an attractive interaction between perfectly conductive parallel plates induced by vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field @xcite , similar effects are present for other fields , boundary conditions , and geometries @xcite .",
    "analogous phenomena take place in classical physics due to equilibrium thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "although important in their own right , the existence of casimir interactions has a series of implications spanning various areas of science @xcite . for instance , the van der waals counterparts of these forces are crucial in understanding the phenomena of wetting @xcite . in nanoscale devices casimir attractions may lead to an undesirable effect of `` stiction '' of closely positioned parts of an apparatus @xcite .",
    "casimir forces can also be made useful ; the first micromachines employing them were recently built @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of the casimir force provide constraints on the existence of extra space dimensions and fundamental physics beyond the standard model @xcite , while dynamic versions of the phenomenon @xcite are related to the hawking radiation from black holes and unruh effect of radiation from accelerating objects .",
    "the casimir interaction @xmath0 can be defined as a difference between the vacuum energy @xmath1 of the system constrained by the boundaries or changes in topology and the vacuum energy of free space : @xmath2 the vacuum energies , in turn , are calculated from a harmonic field theory ( such as quantum electrodynamics in the case of the electromagnetic casimir effect ) , thus implying that @xmath1 is the sum of zero - point energies of a collection of simple harmonic oscillators with a spectrum @xmath3 : @xmath4 where the summation is performed over all branches of the spectrum and over all allowed wave vectors @xmath5 .",
    "the casimir interaction arises due to a difference between the allowed set of wave vectors @xmath5 of the constrained system and that of free space .    in any realization of the casimir effect ,",

    "the role of the parameter @xmath8 consists in suppressing the large-@xmath5 contributions into the vacuum energies to guarantee their convergence .",

    ", the outcome of this procedure gives a finite result that depends only on planck s constant , the speed of light and macroscopic length scale(s ) indicating that we are dealing with a long - wavelength phenomenon ; the same result has been obtained with different regularization schemes , so that it has a universal character .",
    "there is general agreement on the correctness of the result , and yet the route to it is subtle ; it is certainly possible to get other ( physically meaningless ) evaluations of the sum ( [ vacenergy ] ) .",
    "it is a little surprising that in the cancellations that provide a finite result for eq .",
    "( [ casimirdefinition ] ) , no trace of the possible differences between long - wavelength and short - wavelength physics survives , even though this would significantly affect the sum ( [ vacenergy ] ) .    to shed some light on this and other issues having their roots in diverging vacuum energy , volovik",
    "@xcite advocated an approach consisting in studying analog effects in condensed matter systems . here the role of the physical vacuum is played by the ground state of a condensed matter system , and casimir - type effects occur whenever the ground state is disturbed by boundaries or changes of space topology .",
    "the ground - state energy density of a condensed matter system is finite , and neither the harmonic approximation nor regularization are needed to calculate the casimir effect .",
    "this is because the underlying microscopic physics is governed by the well - established quantum mechanics of non - relativistic particles interacting via non - singular interactions . as a result",
    "any quantity of interest can be calculated , at least in principle .",
    "when the low - energy physics of a candidate condensed matter system is described by a harmonic field theory , we ought to find the same interaction as is predicted by a regularization scheme .",
    "there are numerous condensed matter systems whose low - energy physics is described by harmonic field theories .",
    "superfluid @xmath11 in its ground state is the simplest analog to the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics , where the role of photons is played by phonons propagating with sound velocity @xmath12 .",

    "placed a distance @xmath16 away from one of the box walls . for impenetrable box walls",
    "the ground - state energy of this system is identical to that shown in ( b ) : @xmath15 particles in a ring of circumference @xmath17 with two nearly - impenetrable partitions .",
    "regular and bold typefaces show correspondence between geometries ( a ) and ( b ) . ]",
    "volovik provided an example of an exactly - solvable toy condensed matter system @xcite where the casimir interaction seemed to disagree with the regularization - based conclusion ( which is a one - dimensional counterpart of casimir s original force between perfectly - conducting plates ) .",
    "he considered a one - dimensional gas of non - relativistic free spinless fermions in the geometry of fig.1a , where @xmath15 particles are placed inside an impenetrable box of length @xmath17 with a nearly - impenetrable partition ( shown in gray shade ) .",
    "although this is a non - interacting system , nontrivial correlations are built in via the pauli principle .",
    "the partition breaks the system into two nearly - impenetrable boxes of length @xmath16 and @xmath18 ; an infinitesimally small tunnelling transparency allows particle exchange between the boxes to minimize the energy .",
    "the number of fermions @xmath19 captured between one of the walls of the box and the partition can be found by minimizing the ground - state energy @xmath20 with respect to @xmath19 under the constraint that @xmath19 can only take on integer values . as a result",
    "the @xmath21 dependence has the form of a staircase with plateaus located at integer values of @xmath19 .",
    "the inter - plateau transitions are connected via resonant tunneling since the ground state here is degenerate : @xmath22 .",
    "volovik explicitly demonstrated that at the points of degeneracy the force exerted on the partition , @xmath23 , undergoes a discontinuity whose magnitude is parametrically larger than that of the ordinary casimir force implied by the regularization - based result  even in the limit of macroscopic occupancy of both boxes .",
    "he called this phenomenon the `` mesoscopic '' casimir effect because `` high - energy '' physics ( arising from the discreteness of the particles constituting the `` vacuum '' ) explicitly enters into the result even when the sizes of the boxes @xmath16 and @xmath18 are much larger than average interparticle spacing .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached for a one - dimensional model of `` ultra - relativistic '' spinless free fermions with a linear dispersion law @xcite .",
    "more recently the casimir interaction between two well - separated impurities immersed in a one - dimensional spinless quantum liquids was studied within an effective low - energy theory with a cutoff @xcite and in a lattice model @xcite .",
    "a closely related problem is that of the interaction between two vacancies in the one - dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "these studies are related to the @xmath24 limit of the ring geometry shown in fig.1b in the presence of two barriers .",
    "it is easy to realize that when the barriers become barely penetrable the ground - state energy of any quantum liquid in the geometry of fig.1a approaches that in fig",
    "thus for non - interacting fermions and strong impurities it should be possible to compare the conclusions of refs . @xcite and @xcite with volovik s findings @xcite .",
    "it was found @xcite - @xcite that the casimir interaction is a variable - sign oscillatory function of the impurity / vacancy separation @xmath16 , with maxima for the separations which permit resonant tunneling .",
    "the maxima of the casimir energy represent the points of discontinuity of the slope .",
    "qualitatively this agrees with volovik s results @xcite .",
    "we also note that an oscillatory interaction between various kinds of inhomogeneities immersed in an ideal three - dimensional fermi gas was found by bulgac _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is two - fold : first contributions of the effects of the particle discreteness into casimir - type phenomena are computed for an arbitrary spinless quantum liquid by employing the conventional macroscopic field - theoretical viewpoint .",
    "second , these phenomenological conclusions are verified through a rigorous microscopic analysis of the casimir effect for spinless free fermions . as a result",
    "we will be able to : ( i ) establish a relationship between the ordinary and mesoscopic casimir effects , and ( ii ) to link the macroscopic and microscopic approaches .",
    "in addition to these issues of principle , the problem considered here may be of practical interest as the casimir forces between impurities immersed in fermionic quantum wires realized with ultracold gases @xcite might be experimentally measured in the future .    before proceeding we hasten to mention that the effects calculated in this work should not be confused with the relativistic fermionic casimir effect ( with bag - model boundary conditions on the surface ) , which for parallel plates was first worked out by johnson @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we summarize conventional predictions of the harmonic theory and explain how the complications coming from particle discreteness can be accounted for phenomenologically within the harmonic theory .",
    "section iii turns to the non - interacting fermion system , showing how these results can be verified and confirmed via rigorous microscopic analysis .",
    "section iiia deals with the case of a segment whose ends are subject to either an arbitrary combination of the dirichlet and neumann or to periodic boundary conditions imposed on the many - body wavefunction . here",
    "the casimir effect manifests itself as a finite - size correction to the ground - state energy .",
    "the irrelevance of the effects of the particle discreteness in the segment or ring geometries allows us to probe only the continuum part of the casimir force .    a more complicated geometry where the effects of the particle discreteness come into play ( a segment with nearly - impenetrable partition or two nearly - impenetrable partitions inserted into a ring ) is studied in sections iiib and iiic .",
    "the former deals with the limit when the particle discreteness continues to be ignored . in close correspondence with the conclusions of section iiia , we reproduce the results of the effective theory for the case of the dirichlet boundary conditions enforced at the segment ends ( which is equivalent to the case of two partitions inside a ring ) .",
    "the effects of particle discreteness are incorporated in section iiic where macroscopic results of section iia are confirmed .",
    "we conclude ( section iv ) by discussing the correspondence between microscopic and macroscopic viewpoints and posing several questions for future study .",
    "volovik s fermion model exhibits large oscillations in the casimir energy , which arise from effects of particle discreteness . in the following subsections",
    "we show that these can be understood phenomenologically without resorting to microscopic analysis .",
    "we consider a generic harmonic spinless quantum liquid in the geometry of fig.1 .",
    "we begin with restating the well - known result @xcite that the long - wavelength low - energy dynamics of a translationally - invariant one - dimensional spinless quantum liquid comprised of interacting fermions or repulsive bosons of mass @xmath25 is governed by the harmonic ( luttinger liquid ) theory with the lagrangian @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the position , @xmath28 is the time , and @xmath29 is the number density .",
    "the field @xmath30 represents displacement of the particles with respect to the case of equidistant positions .",
    "the first term of ( [ action ] ) describes the kinetic energy while the second accumulates pertinent information about the interparticle interactions ( and statistics , in case of fermions ) parameterized by the sound velocity @xmath12 .",
    "this latter quantity is determined by the ground - state energy ; for spinless free fermions the sound velocity @xmath31 is identical to the fermi velocity .",
    "the description ( [ action ] ) is applicable for spatial scales exceeding the interparticle spacing @xmath32 , provided that the underlying interactions are sufficiently short - ranged and the strain is small ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the interactions due to finite size described above will have the universal casimir form but the boundary conditions also matter . in cases of interest",
    "the collective variable @xmath30 satisfies either the dirichlet condition @xmath34 , or the neumann condition @xmath35 .",
    "the former mimics the perfectly - conducting plate of the original casimir calculation @xcite while the latter corresponds to a plate of infinite magnetic permeability @xcite . if in the geometry of fig .",
    "1a the partition and the walls enforce `` like '' boundary conditions ( i. e. either dirichlet or neumann at all boundaries ) , then for any smooth regularization scheme ( and up to a constant ) the casimir interaction was found to be of the form @xcite @xmath36 the case of mixed boundary conditions is particularly interesting because boyer demonstrated @xcite that for the geometry of fig .",
    "1a the casimir interaction is repulsive @xmath37 when the partition and the walls enforce `` unlike '' boundary conditions @xcite ( i.e. either neumann at the walls and dirichlet at the partition or dirichlet at the walls and neumann at the partition ) .    for @xmath38 eq.([ocasimir ] ) gives @xmath39 which is a well - known result @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , while eq.([unlike ] ) predicts @xmath40 .",
    "regardless of the boundary conditions employed , the @xmath41 behavior of the casimir interaction @xmath0 can be understood via dimensional analysis .",
    "indeed , since the effect is both quantum - mechanical and `` relativistic '' , @xmath0 must depend on @xmath16 , @xmath42 and @xmath12 .",
    "if we additionally assume that the effect is universal , then @xmath0 can not depend on microscopic quantities such as the mass of the underlying particles or the wavevector cutoff @xmath29 .",
    "given @xmath0 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath16 one can form one and only one dimensionless combination @xmath44 which implies @xmath45 where the numerical constant is only determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ action ] ) describes the elastic theory of a one - dimensional solid .",
    "this viewpoint is acceptable because despite the fact that the long - range translational order is destroyed by the zero - point motion @xcite , algebraic correlations survive and typical strains remain small .",
    "quantum fluctuations are additionally suppressed under confinement as in geometries of fig.1 .",
    "a complication arises in the discussion of the elastic theory of a solid , in which the field variable describes the displacements of discrete particles from equilibrium positions . when we change the length of a box containing a certain number of particles , we change both the wavelengths of the excitations of the system and the equilibrium positions themselves : the solid experiences a strain , which changes the ground - state energy . when the strain becomes large enough",
    ", it can be relaxed ( as in geometries of fig.1 ) by adding or removing a particle , but this is a discrete effect .",
    "a second complication is that the introduction of the boundaries will cause particle displacements , no matter where they are put , because the particles might be attracted or repelled by the boundaries .",
    "these effects can be described within the harmonic theory ( [ action ] ) , as we will now demonstrate .",
    "the ground - state energy of a quantum liquid in the geometry of fig .",
    "1a can be obtained by minimizing the sum of the ground - state energies of separate arbitrarily populated boxes @xmath46 with respect to @xmath19 provided the latter is restricted to the integers . in the macroscopic limit @xmath47 when the discreteness of the underlying particles can be at first neglected , this condition reduces to the statement of the equality of the chemical potentials on the two sides of the partition .",
    "this in turn implies that the bulk densities ( and thus the sound velocities ) on the two sides of the partition are the same .",
    "the common density @xmath29 defines the reference zero - strain state , and the field variable @xmath48 in eq.([action ] ) describes displacements away from corresponding interparticle spacing @xmath32 .",
    "although the chemical potentials on the two sides of the partition are equal , the forces are not since the partition is not in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the corresponding osmotic force on the partition is the continuum casimir force implied by eq.([ocasimir ] ) and ( [ unlike ] ) .",
    "when the discreteness of the particles is taken into consideration , a particle exchange across the partition can only occur at the points of degeneracy of the ground state . as explained above",
    "generally this causes a strain which can be computed as follows .",
    "the number of particles captured between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , namely @xmath51 , is constrained to be an integer @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to the boundary condition @xmath52 here @xmath53 is a correction of order unity due to the disturbance of the density profile away from uniformity caused by the ends of the interval .",
    "this correction can not be computed within the harmonic approach since the latter fails in the vicinity of the left wall and the partition .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ boundarycondition ] ) implies that in general there will be a uniform static strain of the form @xmath54 the system can also have time - dependent motions in addition to the static strain ; these are described by the wave equation @xmath55 .",
    "for example , if the field @xmath56 obeys the dirichlet boundary condition at the @xmath49 wall , @xmath34 , then for @xmath57 the corresponding general solution to the wave equation satisfying the boundary condition ( [ boundarycondition ] ) is given by @xmath58 where the @xmath59 are arbitrary complex coefficients .",
    "the sum in eq.([configuration ] ) represents the field configurations responsible for the continuum casimir effect in an interval of length @xmath16 with dirichlet - dirichlet ( dd ) boundary conditions imposed at the segment ends . substituting the solution ( [ configuration ] ) into the lagrangian ( [ action ] ) we find @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the lagrangian corresponding to the sum in eq.([configuration ] )",
    "it is important to notice that the cross terms occurring in the evaluation of @xmath62 vanish upon integration over @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the term linear in @xmath27 and the sum in ( [ configuration ] ) contribute independently to the ground - state energy .",
    "therefore the portion of the casimir energy coming from the @xmath63 modes is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the first term of eq.([ocasimir ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath66 in the second term of ( [ portion ] ) can be recognized as the luttinger liquid exponent governing the low - energy behavior of the correlation functions in one - dimensional harmonic liquids @xcite ; the free - fermion case corresponds to @xmath67 .",
    "for the geometry of fig.1a there are two segments .",
    "the portion of the casimir energy coming from the modes in the segment @xmath68 is computed similarly . combining it with eq.([portion ] )",
    "we arrive at the expression @xmath69 where we specified to the case of the dirichlet wall at @xmath70 ( which explains the third `` d '' in the `` ddd '' superscript ) and employed the continuity of the field variable across the partition at @xmath50 .",
    "since the latter is slightly transparent to particles , the integer parameter @xmath19 can adjust to minimize this expression for any chosen value of @xmath16 .",
    "the result is that the ground - state energy of the system is an oscillatory function of the position of the partition .",
    "the usual casimir effect is the lower envelope of the function , while particle discreteness contributes parabolic cusps .",
    "it should be noted that the scale of the discreteness effect is comparable to the contribution from the zero - point motions .",
    "the conclusion ( [ edddgeneral ] ) is also applicable to the geometry of fig.1b ; in the @xmath71 limit it reduces to the casimir interaction between two strong impurities placed in an infinite luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "in the following subsections we will calculate the ground - state energy for a model of non - interacting spinless fermions . since the long - wavelength excitations of this system are described by a harmonic theory , the finite - size ( casmir ) effects",
    "are captured by the continuum theory as described in previous section . here",
    "we will be able to see how these macroscopic conclusions emerge from a completely different microscopic analyis of the exactly - solvable model .",
    "naturally this will not have the generality of phenomenological theory , however all the details , including the phase of the casimir oscillation @xmath53 in eq.([edddgeneral ] ) will be determined .",
    "there is again an issue of boundary conditions imposed on the many - body wavefunction ( hereafter indicated by the letters d or n ) .",
    "the ( d ) dirichlet boundary condition for the fermion wavefunction implies that no particles can reach the boundary , which is consistent with the dirichlet condition imposed on the collective variable @xmath56 ( i.e. @xmath34 at the boundary ) .",
    "however , the neumann condition for the collective variable ( @xmath72 ) allows a current through the boundary , while the ( n ) neumann condition for the wavefunction does not . at the same time",
    "the ( n ) neumann condition for the wavefunction is not inconsistent with the dirichlet condition imposed on the collective variable .",
    "these statements representing plausible guesses will be verified below ; they imply that the conclusions derived from microscopic analysis of the dirichlet and neumann geometries can be only compared with the macroscopic dirichlet results ( [ ocasimir ] ) and ( [ edddgeneral ] ) .      before directly addressing the geometries of fig.1 we find it useful to start with simpler segment and ring arrangements which may be viewed as reference states for those in fig",
    "the casimir interaction can be extracted as a finite - size correction to the bulk ground - state energy @xcite .",
    "it is intuitively clear and will be made explicit below that the rearrangements of the density profile caused by either dirichlet or neumann boundary condition represent strong perturbations which can not be correctly captured within the harmonic theory ( [ action ] ) .",
    "first consider @xmath19 fermions inside an impenetrable box of length @xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to the `` d '' boundary conditions enforced at the segment ends .",
    "the normalized single - particle wavefunctions for this problem are well - known : @xmath73 where the allowed wave numbers satisfy the condition @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the ground state is built by sequential occupation of the single - particle states beginning from @xmath76 and ending with @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting expressions for the ground - state energy @xmath78 and the particle density inside the box @xmath79 are well - known @xcite .",
    "since the latter is depleted near the box walls , the average bulk density , as evidenced by eq.([density ] ) , is @xmath80 rather than the naively expected @xmath81 .",
    "swiatecki @xcite emphasized the importance of this fact in separating the bulk contribution to the ground - state energy from those due to the boundaries .",
    "we made this explicit in eq.([eofma ] ) which has a form typical of the ground - state energy of a one - dimensional quantum system confined to a segment of length @xmath16 @xcite : the first term gives the bulk energy of the spinless free fermi gas of density @xmath82 while the second term , @xmath83 , represents the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "if both ends of the segment enforce `` n '' boundary conditions , the single - particle ground - state has zero energy and is characterized by a constant wave function , @xmath84 .",
    "the excited states are of the form , @xmath85 , and the allowed wave numbers are determined by @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "it is then straightforward to realize that the ground - state energy of the @xmath19-fermion segment follows from eq.([eofma ] ) by substituting @xmath86 for @xmath19 : @xmath87 the particle density is then given by @xmath88 eq.([freedensity ] ) makes obvious that fact that `` n '' boundary conditions promote particle accumulation near the segment ends where the density reaches the maximal value of @xmath89 .",
    "this is to be expected as the `` n '' boundary condition can be implemented via an attractive potential localized at the boundary . as a result",
    "the bulk density @xmath90 is smaller than @xmath81 .",
    "this is consistent with the expression for the ground - state energy ( [ freeesegment ] ) which implies an attractive casimir interaction of the expected @xmath91 form @xcite .",
    "although eqs.([eofma ] ) and ( [ freeesegment ] ) do not explicitly address the geometry of fig .",
    "1a to which eq.([ocasimir ] ) is supposed to be applicable , they certainly imply plausibility of eq.([ocasimir ] ) for like boundary conditions .      as a next step consider @xmath19 fermions belonging to a segment of length @xmath16 with the `` d '' boundary condition at @xmath49 and `` n '' boundary condition at @xmath50",
    ". then the single - particle wave functions are still given by eq.([wavefunction ] ) while the wave numbers selected by the `` n '' boundary condition at @xmath50 satisfy @xmath92 , @xmath75 .",
    "as a result the ground - state energy and the particle density inside the segment are given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively .",
    "the latter vanishes at the `` d '' end @xmath49 and reaches the maximal value of @xmath95 at the `` n '' end @xmath50 . as evidenced by eq .",
    "( [ unlikedensity ] ) , the particles pushed away from the `` d '' end accumulate at the `` n '' end , and as a result the bulk density @xmath29 takes on the naively expected @xmath81 value",

    "the ground state is built by placing one of the particles into the @xmath98 state while the remaining @xmath86 fermions symmetrically occupy the states beginning from @xmath99 and ending with @xmath100 .",

    "( [ eofmaring ] ) has a structure similar to eqs.([eofma ] ) , ( [ freeesegment ] ) and ( [ unlikeesegment ] ): the first term gives the bulk energy of spinless gas of free fermions of density @xmath102 ( which is everywhere uniform ) while the second term , @xmath103 , represents the casimir effect .",
    "the magnitude of the former in the ring geometry is four times larger than that for the segment @xcite .",

    "this brings up a qualitatively new aspect into the problem : the issue of particle discreteness .",
    "this was not relevant to the segment or ring geometries since the total particle number was fixed .",
    "now as the partition ( or partitions ) is adiabatically displaced , particle exchange across it has to be allowed  otherwise instead of the casimir effect one would be probing the bulk compressibility of the fermi gas .",
    "the effects of particle discreteness are largest when the partition is nearly - impenetrable , i. e. it enforces the `` d '' boundary condition . in what follows",
    "we will only focus on this case .",

    "this continues to be the case as @xmath16 adiabatically increases as long as the latter remains sufficiently small .",
    "thus the @xmath122 dependence is given by the @xmath123 branch of eq.([meso ] ) - it is an increasing function of @xmath16 reflecting the compression of @xmath15 fermions captured inside the box of decreasing size @xmath18 . as @xmath124 the force exerted on the partition ( fig.1a ) or the interaction force between two partitions ( fig .",

    "as @xmath16 continues to increase , the function @xmath122 first decreases because the associated falloff of the energy of localization of a fermion inside the box of size @xmath16 prevails over the increase of energy of the compressed @xmath130-fermion box .",

    "the macroscopic limit of the upper envelope of the casimir interaction continues to be given by eq.([energyenvelope ] ) .",
    "since this is the locus of the points of resonant tunneling , then we can argue that for a `` perfectly transparent '' partition and any combination of `` d '' or `` n '' wall boundary conditions enforced at the segment ends , the casimir interaction is given by eq.([energyenvelope ] ) .",
    "in this paper we employed a model of spinless free fermions in one dimension to complement the macroscopic approach to the casimir effect where it is derived from a regularized low - energy harmonic field theory . in the segment geometry with like ( either dd or nn ) or periodic boundary conditions",
    "when the discreteness of the underlying particles is irrelevant , we found an attractive casimir interaction of the @xmath187 or @xmath188 form , respectively , which is in agreement with well - known results of the conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "additionally we found an attractive casimir interaction of the @xmath187 form for the case of unlike ( dn or nd ) boundary conditions .",
    "when a nearly - impenetrable partition is inserted inside the segment , a redistribution of the particles takes place so as to minimize the system energy ; the discreteness of the fermions plays a major role in determining the casimir force exerted on the partition .",
    "however if the particle discreteness is ignored , then for any combination of the d and n boundary conditions enforced at the segment ends , the lower envelope of the casimir interaction is found to be universally given by eq.([ocasimir ] ) .",
    "particle discreteness gives rise to new effects beyond the conventional casimir force , as first noted by volovik @xcite .",
    "however , we disagree with his conclusion that for the example he proposed ( and we worked out ) `` the casimir vacuum pressure is not within the responsibility of the effective theory , and the microscopic ( trans - planckian ) physics must be evoked '' @xcite",
    ". this is demonstrated by showing how the effects of the particle discreteness can be understood macroscopically ; the result , eq.([edddgeneral ] ) , is in agreement with microscopic analysis of spinless free fermions .",
    "the arguments that led to eq.([edddgeneral ] ) highlight the aspects of the casimir effect in one - dimensional quantum liquids which are obscured in the exact microscopical treatment of non - interacting fermions :    first , the effect of particle discreteness accumulated in the @xmath189 term of eqs.([lagrangian ] ) , ( [ portion ] ) and ( [ edddgeneral ] ) is of nearly - classical origin because the magnitude of the effect does not explicitly depend on planck s constant @xmath42 .",
    "this fact is not obvious from the exact analysis of free fermions because the latter system does not have a classical limit ; the sound velocity @xmath12 in a free - fermion gas is determined by planck s constant @xmath42 .",
    "the only quantity which can be due to quantum effects is the phase of the casimir oscillation set by the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "second , the oscillatory part of the casimir effect is not an artifact of the fermionic model , as the low - energy theory ( [ action ] ) is applicable both to interacting fermions and repulsive bosons .",
    "third , the dependence of the effect on the square of @xmath190 in eqs.([parabola ] ) and ( [ parabolaunlike ] ) directly demonstrates that we are dealing with a phenomenon which is within the reach of the harmonic theory .",
    "moreover all the parameters entering eq.([edddgeneral ] ) , even the particle density @xmath29 ( which here arises from the reciprocal of the interparticle spacing rather than the wavevector cutoff ) , are macroscopic .",
    "thus there is no need to invoke microscopic physics to understand the effect .",
    "the only exception to this might involve the parameter @xmath53 which our macroscopic analysis did not determine .",
    "however there is an argument that concludes that for arbitrary harmonic liquid in the ddd geometry one has @xmath148 in the @xmath38 limit @xcite .",
    "the same value was found rigorously in this work for non - interacting fermions and an arbitrary relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "although more work is needed , it seems plausible that for an arbitrary harmonic liquid occupying the dirichlet segment of length @xmath17 with a nearly - impenetrable partition at @xmath50 one has @xmath148 .",
    "we see that the continuum contributions to the casimir effect agree with corresponding regularization - based conclusions , eq.([ocasimir ] ) ; the oscillatory part of the effect , up to its phase , is common to all the geometries studied , and is correctly described by the macroscopic result ( [ edddgeneral ] ) .    to summarize , we have demonstrated that in the macroscopic limit , the results of the rigorous analysis of the casimir effect in a one - dimensional gas of spinless free fermions are in agreement with the predictions of the bosonic low - energy field theory ( [ action ] ) if the walls are of the dirichlet type and if the particle discreteness is properly accounted for .",
    "the latter implements the physical fact of near impenetrability which means the number of particles captured on either side of the partition is quantized .",
    "the difference between eqs.([ocasimir ] ) and ( [ edddgeneral ] ) is due to the particle discreteness effect ; the comparison of eqs.([edddgeneral ] ) and ( [ parabola ] ) ( describing specific model under the same physical conditions ) shows that the casimir effect for a fermionic system is properly described by a macroscopic theory .",
    "although it seems unlikely that the neumann case will be any different , it would still be interesting to establish what kind of the wavefunction boundary condition corresponds to the neumann boundary condition imposed on the collective variables , and to repeat our analysis for this case .",
    "this is important because ( ignoring the effects of the particle discreteness ) all the examples we studied exhibited only attractive casimir interaction .",
    "additionally , it would be very useful to be able to derive ( rather than guess ) macroscopic boundary conditions starting from microscopic theory .",
