    "in [ 1 ] myers and perry obtained the multidimensional @xmath2-symmetric analogue of the well - known reissner - nordstrm charged black hole solution . in [ 2,3 ] the generalization of the myers - perry solution to the case of @xmath0 ricci - flat internal spaces was obtained .",
    "special cases of the solution [ 2,3 ] were considered earlier in the following publications : [ 4,5 ] ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , [ 6 ] ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 ) , [ 7 ] ( @xmath6 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "( in [ 8 ] the special case of solution [ 2,3 ] with zero electric and scalar charges was obtained . )    the model considered in [ 2,3 ] is described by the action @xmath7 -   \\frac{1}{2\\kappa^{2 } } \\partial_{m } \\varphi \\partial_{n } \\varphi g^{mn } - \\frac{1}{4}\\exp(2\\lambda \\varphi ) f_{mn } f^{mn}\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the metric , @xmath9 is the strength of the electromagnetic field and @xmath10 is the scalar field ( dilatonic field ) . here",

    "we consider as special case of the solution [ 2,3 ] a charged dilatonic black hole with @xmath0 internal ricci - flat spaces",
    ". objects of such sort are very popular in the literature ( see for example [ 2,6,10 - 14 ] . here",
    "we present bounds on the mass of this black hole . for @xmath16 , @xmath3 such",
    "a bound was obtained by gibbons and wells in [ 14 ] .",
    "we also consider an interesting special case of the charged black hole solution with infinite number of internal spaces @xmath17 .",
    "we note that to our knowledge the einstein equations in the infinite - dimensional space were considered first by kalitzin [ 15 ] .",
    "infinite - dimensional spherically - symmetric and cosmological solutions were also presented in [ 3 ] and [ 16 ] respectively .",

    "[ 3 ] are used .",
    "the solution [ 4 ] is defined on the manifold @xmath21 and has the following form @xmath22    \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i=1}^{n } f_{1}^{-1/{a}(\\lambda ) }   \\exp(2 a_{i}u + 2d_{i } ) g^{(i ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a @xmath26-dimensional space - time ( @xmath6 ) , the @xmath27 are ricci - flat manifolds ( @xmath28 is the metric on @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the canonical metric on the @xmath32-dimensional sphere @xmath33 . in ( 2.6)-(2.8 ) @xmath34,\\\\ { a}(\\lambda ) & = & d-3 + \\lambda^{2}(d-2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are constants and the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 satisfy the relation @xmath44",
    "now , we are looking for a black hole solution , that means for the special case of a configuration with external horizon .",
    "to do so , we take the solution ( 2.6)-(2.14 ) with the parameters @xmath45 @xmath46 introducing the parameters @xmath47 and reparametrizing the time and radial coordinates @xmath48 we get the following formulas for the solution ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50   + f_{- } ^{-2/{a}(\\lambda ) }   \\sum_{i=1}^{n }   g^{(i)},\\ ] ] @xmath51 we remind that we consider the case @xmath35 . due to",

    "we get the myers - perry @xmath20-symmetric charged black hole solution [ 1 ] . for @xmath3 , @xmath57",
    "the solution coincides ( up to redefinitions of the field variables ) with the 4-dimensional dilatonic charged black hole solution [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the solution ( 3.6)-(3.11 ) describes an @xmath20-symmetric charged dilatonic black hole with a chain of internal ricci - flat spaces .",
    "the charge of the black hole is @xmath58 and the mass @xmath59 is found from the time component of the metric ( 3.6 ) to be @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the effective gravitational constant ( @xmath63 is defined in [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . using the relation ( 4.1 ) and the inequalities ( 3.12 ) and ( 4.4 ) we get @xmath67 where @xmath68 this can be easily deduced from fig . 1",
    ".    the critical case corresponds to @xmath69 formula ( 4.6 ) agrees with the corresponding relation from ref .",
    "[ 14 ] in the case @xmath57 .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that in the critical case ( 4.7 ) we have a horizon , if and only if @xmath70 for these values of @xmath11 the inequality ( 4.5 ) should be replaced by @xmath71    in the strong coupling limit @xmath72 the critical mass ( 4.6 ) tends to zero .",
    "a possible interpretation of this effect seems to be screening by dilatonic field of the electric charge .",

    "we considered the @xmath20-symmetric charged dilatonic black hole solution with @xmath0 ricci - flat internal spaces .",
    "we obtained the bound on the mass of a black hole for all ( non - zero ) values of the coupling constant .",
