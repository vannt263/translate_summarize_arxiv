    "to map out the phase diagram of hot and dense matter has been a major goal of strong interaction physics during the last decades , both experimentally and theoretically . as is often the case ,",
    "these efforts have been accompanied by studies of drastically simplified , solvable model problems to sharpen the theoretical tools and get guidance for more realistic cases . among",
    "the few known field theories which are both solvable and possess a non - trivial phase structure , fermionic large @xmath0 models in 1 + 1 dimensions like the t hooft model @xcite or gross - neveu models @xcite are perhaps most instructive , as they share a number of properties with quantum chromodynamics ( for a pedagogical review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . given that these models have been formulated back in 1974 already , it is surprising that their phase diagrams as a function of temperature , chemical potential and fermion mass have not yet been fully established . as far as we can tell , the reason is not that these phase diagrams were considered to be uninteresting .",
    "rather , this situation reflects a shortcoming of the first round of theoretical investigations during the 80 s and 90 s with methods too crude to expose the full , rich phase structure . as a consequence ,",
    "there has been renewed interest recently in this topic with results which also have some bearing on low dimensional condensed matter systems , and the original phase diagrams are still in the process of revision right now . for an update on the current state of the art ,",
    "see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "in the present paper , we focus on the phase structure of the massive , chiral gross - neveu ( gn ) model at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "this model is nothing but the 1 + 1 dimensional nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite with @xmath0 fermion flavors and a bare mass term explicitly breaking the u(1)@xmath1u(1 ) chiral symmetry .",

    "we are only interested in the t  hooft limit ( @xmath4 ) in which classic no - go theorems can be bypassed and breakdown of continuous symmetries becomes possible in 1 + 1 dimensions . in spite of the fact that semiclassical methods for solving such models have been developed in the 70 s already @xcite ,",
    "the full phase diagram of the simple field theory with lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) is still largely unknown .",
    "consider first the chiral limit ( @xmath5 ) of the model . if one constrains the condensates @xmath6 to be spatially constant , the resulting phase diagram is identical to the one from the simpler gn model variant with discrete chiral symmetry and scalar - scalar coupling @xmath7 only .",
    "one finds two phases in the ( @xmath8 ) plane , a massless and a massive fermi gas , separated by 1st and 2nd order transitions @xcite .",
    "as soon as one allows for spatially inhomogeneous condensates , the system takes advantage of the peierls effect @xcite and opens a gap at the fermi surface .",
    "this results in a solitonic chiral crystal phase .",
    "the first crystalline solution of the hartree - fock ( hf ) problem which was found is the  chiral spiral \" with helical order parameter and a strikingly different phase diagram @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these results can also be understood readily in terms of bosonization .",
    "very recently however , they have been challenged by a more sophisticated candidate for the complex order parameter in the form of a chirally twisted crystal , using powerful resolvent methods to generate self - consistent solutions in closed analytical form @xcite .",
    "the implications for the phase diagram have not yet been fully worked out but promise an even richer structure of the solitonic crystal phase than previously thought .    turning to the massive chiral gn model ( @xmath9 ) , we first should like to remind the reader that the bare parameters @xmath10 in eq .",

    "the phase diagram assuming @xmath15-independent condensates only @xcite is once again indistinguishable from that of the massive discrete chiral gn model , but this is an artefact of the assumption of homogeneity @xcite . as far as inhomogeneous condensates are concerned , it is useful to start from the low density , low temperature limit governed by the isolated baryons of the model .",
    "baryons of the massive chiral gn model were first studied near the chiral limit by means of variational techniques @xcite and subsequently via the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "they turn out to be closely related to the sine - gordon kink . a recent numerical hf calculation , supplemented by analytical asymptotic expansions ,",
    "has been able to follow the baryon mass and structure to arbitrary @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this was actually done in preparation of the present study .",
    "unlike in the discrete chiral gn model , the self - consistent baryon potentials found were not reflectionless , a serious obstacle for a full analytical solution . aside from individual baryons",
    "relevant to the base line at @xmath16 of the ( @xmath17 ) phase diagram , the vicinity of the tricritical point ( @xmath18 ) has also been explored in some detail @xcite .",
    "the phase structure was deduced from a microscopic ginzburg - landau ( gl ) approach , based once again on the derivative expansion . in this work ,",
    "both first and second order critical lines between homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases were identified . as a result ,",
    "one already starts to see that the gn models with ( broken ) discrete and continuous chiral symmetry have totally different phase diagrams , as is indeed expected on the basis of universality arguments .    in the present paper",
    ", we report on a solution of the hf problem at finite @xmath19 for a whole range of @xmath13 values and construct a first candidate for the full phase diagram of the massive chiral gn model .",

    "we think that such an undertaking is worthwhile in the present situation , but should be followed up by efforts to identify alternative chiral crystal structures which might be thermodynamically more stable @xcite , or by further attempts to arrive at a full analytical solution as in the case of the discrete chiral gn model @xcite .",
    "the remaining paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sect2 ] is devoted to the hf calculation at zero temperature .",

    "we briefly outline the thermal hf approach to the grand canonical potential ( [ sect3a ] ) and recall previous results from gl theory ( [ sect3b ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sect3c ] , we describe in detail how we have obtained the perturbative , 2nd order critical sheet .",
    "the non - perturbative 1st order sheet represents the most difficult part of our analysis , since we can only determine it numerically at present .",

    "[ sect3d ] along with the final results . in the concluding sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] , we summarize our findings , compare the phase diagram with other related phase diagrams and identify areas where more work is needed .",
    "the hf calculation in the chiral gn model starts from the dirac hamiltonian @xmath21 with scalar and pseudoscalar potentials @xmath22 to be determined self - consistently . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a numerical hf study including the dirac sea has been used to construct the baryons of this model . for technical reasons ,",
    "the calculation was done in a finite interval of length @xmath23 with antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions , using a basis of free , massive spinors in discretized momentum space .",
    "now assume that @xmath22 are periodic with spatial period @xmath24 .",

    "to evaluate the energy density of the crystal at @xmath16 , we once again combine a numerical diagonalization with perturbation theory for states deep down in the dirac sea .",
    "the technical details like vacuum subtraction , double counting correction and renormalization are identical to those given in ref .",
    "@xcite and need not be repeated here .    a key element of the hf approach is self - consistency of the potentials @xmath22 .",
    "as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite this can be achieved by minimizing the hf energy at fixed fermion number with respect to the potentials , provided one varies the potentials without any bias . in the present work ,",
    "we assume periodicity , expand @xmath36 and @xmath37 into fourier series , @xmath38 and minimize the hf energy with respect to the fourier coefficients @xmath39 and the spatial period @xmath24 , using a standard conjugate gradient algorithm .",
    "the only other bias put in aside from periodicity are the symmetry relations ( [ a8 ] ) .",
    "if the true self - consistent potential @xmath40 would not be strictly periodic but carry a chiral twist , @xmath41 as proposed in a recent study of the massless chiral gn model @xcite , our calculation might still be useful as a variational calculation , but we could miss the true self - consistent potential .",
    "note however that there is so far no claim of non - periodic potentials in the massive model considered in the present work .      in the limits of low and high fermion density",
    ", the ground state energy can be calculated analytically . if the valence band is completely filled ( as is indeed found in the full hf calculation ) , the spatially averaged baryon density per flavor is related to the period @xmath24 via @xmath42 the last equation defines the fermi momentum @xmath43 . at very low density ,",
    "we expect the energy density to be determined by the baryon mass , @xmath44 the baryon mass is known already from ref .  @xcite . at high density on the other hand",

    "here , one does not see a crossing of the two curves .",
    "due to the limited numerical accuracy , one can not rule out a very weak first order transition , therefore it is difficult to locate the tricritical point precisely in this manner .",
    "the result of such a computation of the 1st order critical line at @xmath133 is shown in fig .",

    "the solid line is the perturbative 2nd order line from sec .",

    "the squares are numerically determined 1st order phase transitions . we only show those points for which we could unambiguously identify a 1st order transition . above @xmath134 , there was no visible line crossing anymore . in this way , a small gap between the 2nd and 1st order phase boundaries is left .",
    "all we can say is that the tricritical point lies on the 2nd order line above the last 1st order point shown , i.e. , at @xmath135 in the case at hand . for as much as we can tell ,",
    "the two critical lines are joined tangentially at the tricritical point .",
    "note that the base point of the 1st order line at @xmath16 drawn here is the baryon mass at @xmath133 taken from ref .",
    "the fact that the numerical points interpolate nicely between the baryon mass at @xmath16 and the perturbative phase boundary is a healthy sign , suggesting that the accuracy reached here is adequate .    in a lengthy numerical calculation with maple",
    ", we have determined a number of 1st order critical lines , see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "the solid curve at @xmath16 is the baryon mass from ref .",
    "the thin lines are the 2nd order critical lines from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the points are numerically determined 1st order transitions computed on a grid with resolution @xmath136 . also shown are two additional curves at very small @xmath13 ( 0.01 and 0.0001 ) obtained previously by means of the gl theory @xcite .",
    "these results confirm the picture discussed in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] and provide us with a first candidate for the full phase diagram of the chiral gn model .",
    "we find no indication of any further phase transitions beyond those which have been identified in the earlier study near the tricritical point @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we have also plotted a tricritical line where the 1st and 2nd order critical sheets are joined together . as is clear from the gap between the calculated 1st order sheet and this line , some extrapolation had to be used .",
    "we proceeded as follows . for a fixed value of @xmath13 , we move along the 2nd order instability line , starting well below the expected tricritical point .",
    "we then perform the hf minimization and follow in particular the evolution of the largest fourier components @xmath89 . at the tricritical point , these are expected to vanish with some power law @xmath137 . in order to find the relevant critical exponent @xmath138",
    ", we went back to the gl approach near @xmath63 @xcite and performed a similar analysis there .",
    "this has the advantage that we can work with a much higher numerical precision in this regime .",
    "let us first recall that to take advantage of simple scaling properties near the tricritical point , the variables @xmath8 have been replaced by the rescaled variables @xmath139 with @xmath140 in ref .",
    "we now move along the perturbative phase boundary plotted in fig .",

    "the effective action is minimized with respect to the fourier components of @xmath39 ( @xmath143 ) and the period .",
    "the resulting grand canonical potential is compared to the homogeneous calculation in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "[ fig13 ] then shows clearly that the fourier components @xmath89 vanish like @xmath144 .",
    "( notice that the grand canonical potential and the fourier components in figs .",

    "@xcite . ) as a by - product , we have determined in this way a more accurate value of the tricritical point near @xmath63 than in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath147 .",
    "coming back to the full hf calculation , we have located the point where @xmath89 vanish along the 2nd order instability curve assuming the same critical exponent @xmath148 for all @xmath13 .",
    "due to numerical limitations , the extrapolation is not as quantitative as in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , but still fairly straightforward .",
    "the result is the tricritical curve drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "to summarize , we have redrawn the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] in a way which shows more clearly the shape of the 2 critical sheets , see fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] . here ,",
    "we hide the  engineering details \" of the underlying construction still visible in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . whereas the vertical ( 1st order ) lines have actually been computed via hf ,",
    "the horizontal lines are composed of straight line segments joining neighboring points to guide the eye .",
    "the tricritical line separates 1st and 2nd order sheets .",
    "it is not completely smooth since this particular curve is the most difficult part of the whole calculation , exceptionally sensitive to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "it is interesting to compare this newly determined phase diagram of the massive chiral gn model to other related phase diagrams . for this purpose",
    ", we have taken the results for the discrete chiral gn model from ref .",
    "@xcite and plotted them at the same scale and under the same viewing angle as in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] . here",
    "the 2 critical sheets are both 2nd order and joined in a cusp rather than tangentially . the qualitative differences between figs .",
    "[ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] are due to the difference between continuous and discrete chiral symmetries of the two gn - type models , reflecting the corresponding universality classes .",
    "if one would only admit homogeneous phases as was done in the early works on these phase diagrams , the 2 models would give identical results .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the dark shaded sheet is 1st order , and there is only a single massive fermi gas phase at @xmath149 .",
    "let us finally comment on some open questions . as pointed out above , to determine the tricritical line of the chiral gn model requires some extrapolation of numerical results .",
    "the minimization becomes difficult close to the tricritical line where the effective potential is flat .",
    "independent analytical work on the tricritical line and the critical exponent @xmath138 discussed above would therefore be useful .",
    "one would also like to know the universality classes to which the different variants of gn models belong .",
    "another issue where further work is needed is related to the possibility of chiral twist in the massless case , recently discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the symmetry point of view",
    ", the situation in the chiral limit may be characterized as follows : the hamiltonian commutes with the generators ( @xmath150 ) of translations and vector / axial vector phase transformations of the fermions .",
    "a mass term ( like in the vacuum or any homogeneous phase ) breaks @xmath151 , reducing chiral symmetry to u(1 ) vector transformations with the appearance of a massless goldstone boson , the pion , and leaves @xmath37 unbroken .",
    "the chiral spiral solution breaks @xmath37 and @xmath151 , but leaves the linear combination @xmath152 unbroken .",
    "since one unbroken , continuous symmetry is left , one expects only one gapless excitation , a mixture of a phonon and a pion .",
    "if the twisted kink crystal is realized , the symmetry will be further broken down to one discrete combination of translation and @xmath153 phase rotation , cf .",
    "( [ a10a ] ) .",
    "such crystals should feature two different gapless excitations , the phonon and the pion . in view of these different physics implications , it is important to reconsider the phase diagram in the chiral limit once again and establish the thermodynamically most stable phases .    in the massive chiral gn model , chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken by the bare mass term , and @xmath151 does not commute with @xmath27 anymore .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the @xmath151 operator appears in a residual discrete symmetry of the condensates , as in the chirally twisted kink crystal .",
    "the only remaining issue is then the fate of translational symmetry and its generator @xmath37 .",
    "so far , we have tacitly assumed that translational invariance breaks down to a discrete subgroup with concomitant periodic potentials , as is common in condensed matter systems .",
    "if this assumption would turn out to be wrong , the present calculation should be regarded as a variational calculation rather than the exact solution of the model in the large @xmath0 limit , but such a scenario does not seem very likely to us .",
