    "among the deepest challenges in glass physics is understanding the temperature dependence of the stokes - einstein ratio in the neighborhood of the glass temperature @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an apparently related phenomenon is the stretched - exponential relaxation of density fluctuations and other correlations .",
    "both phenomena have been cited as evidence for dynamic heterogeneities @xcite , which supposedly provide rapid diffusion paths relevant to the first case , and a variety of localized , relaxation environments in the second @xcite .",
    "here , i offer a counterproposal  that these phenomena can be explained more systematically by the multi - species shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory that bouchbinder and i @xcite invoked to understand the broad range of time scales observed in viscoelastic experiments .",
    "a short account of this proposal has appeared in @xcite .",
    "the present version of the stz theory is an extension of the flow - defect theories of turnbull , cohen , spaepen , argon and others @xcite in which localized clusters of molecules undergo irreversible rearrangements in response to applied shear stresses . in more recent publications @xcite , my coworkers and",
    "i have argued that these flow defects , i.e. the stz s , must be dynamic entities .",
    "they are thermally activated , structural fluctuations that appear and disappear on time scales of the order of the @xmath1 relaxation time @xmath2 . in the presence of a shear stress ,",
    "they are the places where irreversible molecular rearrangements occur .",
    "the stz s also may be associated with self diffusion of a tagged molecule . at most times ,",
    "such a molecule remains in its cage , surrounded by its neighbors .",
    "it participates in a rearrangement involving these neighbors only when a thermally activated structural fluctuation  a shear transformation",
    " occurs at its location . when that happens , the tagged molecule jumps some distance , perhaps an intermolecular spacing @xmath3 , in some direction , while one or more of its neighbors jumps in the other direction .",
    "a sequence of such jumps becomes a diffusive trajectory .    in almost all of the earlier stz literature , for example in @xcite ,",
    "the main focus has been on nonlinear phenomena .",
    "we have computed the quasistationary responses of amorphous materials to strong , slow , driving forces , and have argued that the configurational states of such systems must necessarily be described by the effective temperatures of their structural degrees of freedom @xcite . here , in contrast , i focus on well equilibrated glassy systems , near their glass temperatures , subject only to infinitesimally weak perturbations .",
    "newtonian linear viscosity , self diffusion , and time dependent relaxation of small density fluctuations as seen in scattering experiments , all fall into this category . in this linear limit",
    ", the effective temperature is the same as the ambient temperature , and the noisy fluctuations that activate the creation and annihilation of stz s are purely thermal .",
    "therefore , this paper and its immediate predecessors @xcite probe different aspects of glass physics than usually have been discussed in connection with stz theory .    the most important way in which these papers differ from the earlier ones is in their introduction of multiple species of stz s . in @xcite ,",
    "bouchbinder and i argued that the stz s in well equilibrated , low - temperature systems predictably occur with a broad range of internal transition rates , and that the resulting multi - species theory accurately accounts for experimentally observed , frequency - dependent , viscoelastic response functions @xcite . in sec.[stz ] of this paper , i briefly summarize the linearized equations of motion for this class of stz theories .",
    "then , in sec.[stokes - einstein ] , i show that this multi - species theory predicts a strongly temperature dependent viscosity that , even in the absence of enhanced diffusion , is consistent with the observed stokes - einstein violations .",
    "the extension of this theory to self - diffusion is discussed in sec.[self - diffusion ] .",
    "there , i show that the presence of slowly responding stz s in the multi - species theory requires the existence of something like cascades of correlated hopping events in order that the theory be consistent with observations of normal fickian diffusion near the glass temperature .",
    "i also show that the distribution of stz transition rates predicts stretched - exponential decay of density fluctuations in apparent agreement with observations .",
    "i conclude in sec.[conclusions ] with remarks about ways in which these theoretical proposals need to be tested experimentally .",

    "the @xmath7 are the rates of forward and backward stz transitions .",
    "the symbol @xmath8 denotes the internal transition rate , defined for this purpose to be @xmath9 . writing eq.([ndot ] ) with this explicit @xmath8 dependence implies that a range of different species of stz s , with different values of @xmath8 , will be relevant to the phenomena of interest . in the following discussion ,",
    "i denote the probability distribution for the @xmath8 s by @xmath10 .",
    "the second pair of terms on the right - hand side of eq.([ndot ] ) are the rates of stz creation and annihilation .",
    "these are thermally activated processes , expressed in the form of a detailed - balance relation in which the equilibrium stz density is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temperature in energy units .",
    "@xmath13 is the stz formation energy which , to a first approximation , is the energy required to create the amorphous analog of a vacancy - interstitial pair .",
    "@xmath14 is the average volume per molecule , proportional to the cube of the average molecular spacing @xmath3 .",
    "the attempt frequency @xmath15 is best understood as a dimensionless , thermal noise strength .",
    "it is a super - arrhenius function whose strong @xmath16 dependence governs the equilibrium glass transition . because time is measured in molecular units , @xmath15 must be of the order of unity at large @xmath16 , where the attempt frequency is the molecular vibration frequency . as @xmath16 decreases through the glass temperature @xmath17 ,",
    "the rate of thermally activated structural rearrangements slows dramatically , and @xmath15 falls rapidly toward zero . the structural relaxation rate , @xmath18 ,",
    "is conventionally identified as the @xmath1 relaxation rate @xmath19 . for present purposes ,",
    "i take @xmath15 to be an observable but not necessarily predictable quantity .",
    "see @xcite for my best attempt to date to compute it from first principles .",
    "all of the phenomena to be considered here are technically `` slow '' in the sense that their characteristic time scales are much longer than the times on which the @xmath4 in eq.([ndot ] ) relax to quasistationary values .",
    "note that this was not true for the oscillatory viscoelasticity discussed in @xcite , where the broad range of driving frequencies included those that are fast as well as slow on intrinsic stz time scales . here",
    ", we are interested only in linear steady - state viscous flow , or in diffusional relaxation over times of the order of or longer than @xmath2 ; therefore , all of the information that we need can be obtained by setting @xmath20 on the left - hand side of eq.([ndot ] ) and solving for the @xmath4 .    in this quasistationary approximation , to first order in the stress @xmath5 , the steady - state plastic strain rate @xmath21 has the form @xmath22\\cr \\\\&= & \\epsilon_0\\,\\int_0^{\\infty } d\\nu\\,\\tilde p(\\nu)\\,{1\\over \\tau(\\nu)}\\,{\\cal t}(s),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and , to first order in @xmath5 , @xmath24 equation([gammadot ] ) comes directly from eq.([ndot ] ) with no additional assumptions .",
    "its structure implies that @xmath25 is the event rate for stz s of species @xmath8 . as explained in appendix [ appendix ]",
    ", @xmath25 is the frequency at which an stz is created in one of its internal states and annihilated in the other state , having made an arbitrary ( odd ) number of transitions between those states during its lifetime .",
    "there are several aspects of these equations that need emphasis .",
    "first , they assume that @xmath26 , the volume of the plastic core of a shear transformation , is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "second , the definition of @xmath2 introduced earlier and again in eq.([tau ] ) , is not tied directly to the temperature dependence of the viscosity @xmath27 .",
    "that is , @xmath27 is not always simply proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "third , @xmath29 is the stress - induced bias between forward and backward transitions .",
    "the final expression in eq.([calt ] ) is the classic einstein formula , deduced from the assumption that the underlying transition is a stress - enhanced , thermally activated process . in @xcite , this result was shown to follow from the second law of thermodynamics , with @xmath16 more generally being the thermodynamically defined effective temperature @xmath30 . a simple application of the preceding analysis to rapidly sheared systems , where the transverse diffusion constant is @xmath31 , confirms that @xmath30 is the same as the effective temperature determined by a fluctuation - dissipation relation , at least within the stz theory . ( see @xcite and references cited there . ) throughout the present paper",
    ", thermodynamic equilibrium implies that @xmath32 .",
    "in @xcite , bouchbinder and i derived a formula for the distribution @xmath10 starting with the assumption that the zero - stress transition rate has the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an activation energy .",
    "@xmath35 , in analogy to @xmath36 in eq.([ndot ] ) , is an attempt frequency that , in principle , can depend on both @xmath34 and @xmath16 . continuing this analogy",
    ", we argued that @xmath35 must be unity for small @xmath34 and large @xmath16 ( fast transitions ) , but becomes small in the opposite limit . because @xmath34 is measured _ downward",
    "_ from some reference energy , its probability distribution has the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a positive , @xmath16-independent constant that is less than unity .",
    "then , for small @xmath34 ( large @xmath8 ) , @xmath39 this distribution diverges at small @xmath8 and must be cut off there . to choose that cutoff , say at @xmath40",
    ", we argued that the internal transition rates can not be slower than the rate of spontaneous structural rearrangements .",
    "therefore , we chose @xmath41 , which , according to eq.([tau ] ) , is several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath36 for systems near their glass temperatures .",
    "the corresponding distribution over barrier heights , @xmath42 , as given in eq.([pdelta ] ) with a sharp cutoff at large @xmath34 , is roughly consistent with that found experimentally by argon and kuo @xcite .",
    "using these constraints , bouchbinder and i wrote a three - parameter @xmath8 distribution in the form @xmath43},\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a normalization constant .",
    "we used @xmath45 in accord with viscoelastic data for various materials near their glass temperatures @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath46 , which determines the sharpness of the cutoff at @xmath47 , is not sharply determined by experiment . for most purposes ,",
    "we have used @xmath48 .",
    "there was no need to specify the quantity @xmath35 in eq.([nudef0 ] ) ; its principal role is to provide a physical mechanism for producing very small values of @xmath8 without requiring unphysically large values of @xmath34 .",
    "these first - principles estimates of @xmath10 and @xmath47 , with no additional fitting parameters , are accurately confirmed by the experimental data .",
    "a central feature of the present analysis is that , as implied by eq.([tau ] ) and discussed in the appendix , there are two different limiting populations of stz s at low temperatures .",
    "there are `` fast '' stz s , with @xmath49 , for which @xmath50 .",
    "these stz s may make multiple , back and forth transitions between their two states during their lifetimes .",
    "there is also a substantial population of `` slow '' stz s with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which make at most one transition before disappearing .",
    "both populations are important for determining the inverse viscosity : @xmath53    equation ( [ eta ] ) makes it clear that the distribution @xmath10 plays a crucial role in determining the viscosity . at high temperatures ,",
    "@xmath47 is large , of the order of unity , and @xmath10 must be peaked at a comparably large value of @xmath8 . as a result , eq.([eta ] ) becomes a conventional formula in which @xmath54 . on the other hand , at temperatures near or below @xmath55 , the integration in eq.([eta ] ) is dominated by the slow stz s with @xmath56 , and the conventional formula for @xmath27 is enhanced by a factor that can be shown to be roughly proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "suppose , for the moment , that diffusion in this system is entirely normal , with a diffusion constant given simply by @xmath58 .",
    "then eq.([eta ] ) predicts that the stokes - einstein ratio is @xmath59^{-1 } \\equiv c_{se}(\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath60 . since @xmath2 has cancelled out of eq.([se ] ) , and @xmath10 is a function only of @xmath61 ( apart from a cutoff at large @xmath8 when necessary ) , the only temperature dependence of @xmath62 occurs via the ratio @xmath63 . in @xcite , we estimated that @xmath64 .",
    "that estimate has been used in evaluating eq.([se ] ) to plot the graphs of @xmath65 as functions of @xmath66 shown in fig .",
    "[ cse(t ) ] . the balance between the contributions of slow and fast stz s in eq.([se ] )",
    "is determined largely by the exponent @xmath38 in eq.([pnu ] ) , thus @xmath65 is shown in the figure for five different values of @xmath38 .",
    "this theory does not ( yet ) have enough microscopic physical content to make an accurate connection between low and high - temperature behaviors , or even to make material - specific predictions of the shape of @xmath10 or the length scale @xmath67 .",
    "if , as argued in the preceding paragraph , @xmath10 becomes peaked at large values of @xmath8 for high temperatures , then @xmath68 in that limit .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ cse(t ) ] imply stokes - einstein violations of roughly the magnitude seen experimentally , arising entirely from the anomalously large viscosity predicted by eq.([eta ] ) .",
    "turn now to the statistical problem of self diffusion . here , instead of averaging over probabilities of single events as above , we must consider sequences of multiple hopping events .",
    "the statistical weight assigned to any such sequence depends on how far the molecule moves and how long it takes to get there .",
    "technically , the molecule executes a `` continuous - time random walk '' ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "note that the model of stz - enabled diffusion steps contains no information about dynamics on sub - molecular space or time scales . in effect , it is coarse grained on the scale of the molecular spacing , and it `` knows '' nothing about fast vibrational motions other than that they carry the thermal noise that activates barrier - crossing transitions .",
    "therefore , this model can not describe @xmath70 relaxation or any details of how a molecule moves within the cage formed by its neighbors , or of how it escapes from that cage .",
    "the basic ingredient of the ctrw analysis is the one - step probability that , after waiting a time @xmath71 , an stz fluctuates into existence at the position of the tagged molecule , and the molecule jumps a distance @xmath72 .",
    "( there is no loss of generality in projecting the diffusion mechanism onto one dimension . ) for an stz with an internal rate @xmath8 , this normalized one - step probability distribution is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the probability of a jump of length @xmath72 . as indicated , @xmath74 may depend on @xmath8 . the crucial assumption here",
    "is that the time @xmath75 appearing in this formula is the same as the quantity defined in eq.([tau ] ) . in both cases",
    ", @xmath25 is the average rate at which stz s appear , make one net internal transformation ( perhaps after multiple back - and - forth transformations ) , and then disappear .",
    "this elementary fluctuation mechanism should be common to both plastic deformation and self diffusion .",
    "the probability of any random walk consisting of a sequence of such steps is a product of space - time convolutions of factors @xmath76 .",
    "if the stz events are uncorrelated  a major assumption  then each factor can be averaged independently over @xmath8 .",
    "the walk ends after a final time interval @xmath71 within which the molecule does not make a further jump ; thus the complete path probability contains one factor @xmath77 again included in the convolution integrals and averaged over @xmath8 .",
    "these space and time convolutions are converted into products by computing fourier and laplace transforms , in terms of which the multi - step walk probabilities can be summed to all orders . the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath78 , i.e. the @xmath79th fourier component of the diffusion profile , is given by an inverse laplace transform : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the laplace transform of the averaged @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the analogous transformation of @xmath76 .",
    "a crucial ingredient in these formulas is the jump - length distribution @xmath84 .",
    "if , according to the discussion following eq.([calt ] ) , each stz event moves the tagged molecule a mean - square distance @xmath85 , then it would be natural to choose a gaussian distribution @xmath86 independent of @xmath8 . with this choice , however , the slow stz s play the role of deep traps @xcite , effectively shutting down long - time diffusion . to see this ,",
    "compute the mean - square displacement @xmath87 , which , for a @xmath8-independent @xmath88 , becomes @xmath89_{k=0}= a^2\\,\\int { dw\\over 2\\,\\pi\\,i}\\ , { e^{w\\,t/\\tau_{\\alpha}}\\over w^2\\,\\tilde k(w)}.\\ ] ] if @xmath10 cuts off sharply at small @xmath8 , then @xmath90 is analytic at @xmath91 , and the long - time behavior is obtained by integrating around the pole there .",
    "the result is that @xmath92 , with @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , ordinary diffusion is suppressed by a factor @xmath94 . for @xmath95 in eq.([pnu ] ) , @xmath96 diverges , and @xmath97 vanishes .",
    "this result is manifestly inconsistent with the experimental data reported in @xcite , where fickian diffusion was observed near the glass temperature .",
    "given the @xmath10 determined by the frequency - dependent viscoelasticity @xcite , this discrepancy between diffusion theory and experiment appears to falsify the postulate of uncorrelated short jumps within the context of the present theory .",
    "it seems , instead , to indicate that the cascades of correlated stz `` flips '' seen in low - temperature numerical simulations ( see @xcite and earlier papers cited there ) are relevant to laboratory systems at temperatures near @xmath0 .",
    "a systematic generalization of the ctrw analysis to include strongly correlated sequences of jumps is beyond the scope of this investigation ; but it is plausible that such sequences might appear approximately in the form of anomalously long jumps initiated by individual slow events . unlike the fast stz s ,",
    "the slow ones are stable only in near - equilibrium glass formers at low temperatures , and they only occasionally undergo shear transformations during their lifetimes . their small values of @xmath8 imply that their internal energy barriers are high ; therefore , when they do make transitions , they release substantial amounts of energy that could trigger subsequent events .",
    "suppose , as a first guess , that a slow event sends a tagged molecule on a random walk that lasts for a time @xmath75 , during which the jump rate is @xmath19 .",
    "the mean - square displacement during this walk would be @xmath98 , which is equal to @xmath85 for fast stz s , but becomes substantially larger for slow ones .",
    "the corresponding jump - length distribution is @xmath99 this choice of @xmath84 , if correct , would solve the problem of overly slow diffusion . when eq.([fhat ] ) is used in eq.([fhat - w ] ) , the quantity @xmath100 in the denominator of eq.([zsquared ] ) cancels out , and @xmath101 at all times .",
    "this means that diffusion in this approximation is normal in the sense that @xmath58 , and that the assumption leading to the expression for the stokes - einstein ratio in eq.([se ] ) would be correct .",
    "finally , consider the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath78 given by eqs.([fhat - w]-[jdef ] ) . to evaluate @xmath78 numerically ,",
    "close the contour of integration in eq.([fhat - w ] ) around the branch cut on the negative real @xmath102 axis .",
    "some results are shown in fig.[ser-1 ] .",
    "the parameters correspond roughly to a metallic glass near @xmath0 : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the wavenumbers are @xmath105 , from left to right .",
    "all four curves exhibit stretched - exponential relaxation of the form @xmath106 $ ] , with @xmath107 , in the same order of decreasing @xmath79 .",
    "several features of these results are notable .",
    "first , there is a fickian limit at small @xmath79 , where @xmath108 approaches unity , and @xmath109 as shown by the dashed line in fig.[ser-1 ] for @xmath110 .",
    "second , there is a non - fickian limit at large @xmath79 , where the curves begin to lie on top of each other , and @xmath108 approaches @xmath111 .",
    "this limiting behavior occurs because any realistic choice of the factor @xmath84 vanishes at large @xmath79 , leaving the initial , @xmath79-independent function @xmath100 in the numerator of eq.([fhat - w ] ) as the only contribution to the relaxation function .",
    "note that @xmath112 has the form of a local relaxation function averaged over a distribution of environments with different relaxation times @xmath75 .",
    "the transition between large-@xmath79 and small-@xmath79 behavior is temperature dependent _ via _ the quantity @xmath113 in eq.([fhat - w ] ) , which produces a @xmath16 dependence here in much the way it did for the viscosity in eq.([eta ] ) . at fixed @xmath79 , according to these equations , the system changes from stretched - exponential to fickian as the temperature increases .",
    "it is not a coincidence that , in the large-@xmath79 limit given in eq.([kdef2 ] ) and at low temperatures , @xmath114 ; but @xmath115 is not even an exact result for all choices of @xmath38 and @xmath46 , nor is it exact in the limit of long times .",
    "in summary , the multi - species stz theory , with the transition - rate distribution @xmath10 derived directly from statistical principles , and with essentially no arbitrary parameters , has been convincingly successful in predicting frequency - dependent viscoelastic responses of glassy materials . as argued here in sec.[stokes - einstein ] , this theory predicts that the steady - state , linear viscosity is strongly temperature dependent in the neighborhood of the glass temperature .",
    "that prediction , in turn , suggests that observed anomalies in the temperature dependence of the stokes - einstein ratio are due to large viscosities , and not necessarily to the emergence of rapid diffusion paths at low temperatures .",
    "the multi - species theory also predicts stretched - exponential decay of density fluctuations , and further predicts temperature and wave - number dependences of the stretched - exponential function that appear to agree with observations .",
    "the outstanding uncertainty in this theoretical picture is that , in its simplest version , it predicts that the slow stz s act like traps and shut down fickian diffusion at low temperatures , in contradiction to experimental measurements @xcite . to resolve this discrepancy ,",
    "i have suggested in sec.[self - diffusion ] that the correlated cascades of stz - like events observed in low - temperature molecular - dynamics simulations @xcite need somehow to be incorporated into the diffusion analysis .",
    "this is done here , in an admittedly _ ad hoc _ way , by choosing a @xmath8-dependent jump size distribution @xmath84 in eq.([fhat ] ) .",
    "it is not clear whether eq.([fhat ] ) is a realistic approximation , or whether a more accurate description of correlated diffusion steps might modify the predicted stokes - einstein ratio .",
    "the analysis presented here calls for a unified investigation of stokes - einstein violations , stretched - exponential relaxation , and frequency dependent viscoelastic response functions , all in comparable glass - forming materials near their glass temperatures . checking the consistency of the various formulas shown here would test the theory as a whole and its interpretation of diverse dynamic phenomena . for example , it ought to be possible to measure viscoelastic responses ( or internal - friction functions ) using the same materials , under the same conditions , that are used for measuring @xmath78 in the large-@xmath79 limit shown in eq.([kdef2 ] ) .",
    "then , it should be possible either to deduce consistent approximations for @xmath10 , or else to falsify the predicted consistency .",
    "similarly , it would be useful to make the latter kinds of measurements for the same systems in which fickian diffusion is observed , and thus to test the approximation for @xmath84 in eq.([fhat ] ) .",
    "detailed studies of the @xmath79 and @xmath16 dependences of @xmath78 , again on the same systems for which other measurements are made , might further resolve the outstanding issues .",
    "to interpret the event rate @xmath25 defined in eq.([tau ] ) , it is useful to perform a continuous - time , random - walk analysis similar to that used for diffusion in sec.[self - diffusion ] , but now restricted to transitions back and forth between the internal @xmath116 states of a single stz .",
    "consider an elementary process in which an stz is created in a @xmath117 state and then , after a sequence of back and forth transitions , is annihilated in a @xmath116 state .",
    "the stz has made a single forward or backward step during its lifetime .",
    "the rates for these transitions are contained in the equations of motion , eq.([ndot ] ) , for the densities of @xmath116 stz s , @xmath4 . according to these equations",
    ", @xmath36 is the rate at which stz s ( of either sign ) are annihilated by thermal fluctuations , and @xmath7 is the rate at which @xmath117 stz s make transitions to @xmath116 stz s .",
    "now , use these rate factors to compute the probability of a @xmath117 stz either being annihilated or making a transition to its @xmath116 state at time @xmath118 , if it formed at @xmath119 .",
    "this probability is the normalized waiting - time distribution @xmath120 \\,e^{-\\bigl[\\rho + r(\\pm s)\\bigr]\\,t}.\\ ] ] the probability that this stz has _ not _ disappeared or changed its state at time @xmath71 is @xmath121\\,t}.\\ ] ]    now compute the probability per unit time for a sequence of such transitions .",
    "suppose , for example , that the stz starts in its @xmath122 state and makes one transition to its @xmath123 state before being annihilated at time @xmath124 .",
    "the probability per unit time for this particular sequence of transitions is @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the formation rate . for any such sequence of transitions ,",
    "the rate is a convolution of functions @xmath127 , multiplied by factors @xmath7 , and integrated over intermediate times @xmath128 , etc .. for simplicity , assume that @xmath5 is not a function of time .",
    "then we can perform all of these integrations by using the laplace transforms @xmath129 so that the laplace transform of the rate for any sequence of transitions is just a product of factors @xmath130 and @xmath7 .",
