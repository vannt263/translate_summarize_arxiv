    "observationally based estimates of the three - dimensional shapes of galaxies serve as a diagnostic of the physics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "galaxies can only be seen in projection against the sky ; thus , astronomers can only attempt to deduce their three - dimensional properties from their two - dimensional , projected properties .",
    "obviously , information about intrinsic shapes is lost in projection ; for instance , using only the two - dimensional surface photometry of a given galaxy , it is impossible to determine its intrinsic three - dimensional shape .",
    "elliptical galaxies have isophotes that are well approximated as ellipses ( hence the name `` elliptical '' ) .",
    "the shape of an ellipse is specified by its axis ratio @xmath0 , with @xmath3 .",
    "the three - dimensional isophotal surfaces of elliptical galaxies are generally modeled as ellipsoids .",
    "a stellar system whose isophotal surfaces are similar , concentric ellipsoids , without axis twisting , will have projected isophotes which are similar , concentric ellipses , without axis twisting @xcite .",
    "the apparent axis ratio @xmath0 of the projected ellipses depends on the viewing angle and on the intrinsic axis ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the ellipsoid . here",
    ", @xmath4 is the ratio of the intermediate to long axis , and @xmath5 is the ratio of the short to long axis ; thus , @xmath6 .",
    "beginning with @xcite , many attempts have been made to deduce the distribution of intrinsic shapes of elliptical galaxies , given their distribution of apparent shapes .",
    "the early assumption , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , was that elliptical galaxies were oblate spheroids , flattened by rotation @xcite .",
    "if elliptical galaxies were all oblate spheroids ( @xmath7 ) , or all prolate spheroids ( @xmath8 ) , and if their orientations were random , then it would be possible to deconvolve their distribution of apparent axis ratios @xmath9 , to find their distribution of intrinsic axis ratios @xmath10 .",
    "however , the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite led astronomers to abandon the assumption that elliptical galaxies are necessarily oblate .",
    "the shapes of ellipticals have been reanalyzed with the assumption that they are intrinsically prolate or triaxial , rather than oblate @xcite .",
    "statements about the intrinsic shapes of galaxies must be statistical in nature , since astronomers do not exactly know the distribution @xmath9 of axis ratios for a given class of galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we will be examining the apparent axis ratios for galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey(hereafter sdss ; york _ et al .",
    "the set of axis ratios we analyze constitute a finite sample drawn from a parent population @xmath9 . in this paper , we take into account the finite size of the sample in rejecting or accepting , at a known confidence level , two null hypotheses : that the galaxies are randomly oriented oblate spheroids , or that they are randomly oriented prolate spheroids . to accomplish this",
    ", we make a kernel estimate , @xmath11 , of the distribution of axis ratios and mathematically invert @xmath11 to find @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the estimated distribution of intrinsic axis ratios for a population of oblate spheroids and a population of prolate spheroids , respectively .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ data ] , we describe the sloan digital sky survey , and the methods by which the apparent axis ratios of the galaxies are estimated . in section  [ method ] , we present a brief review of the nonparametric kernel estimators used in this paper . in sections  [ dev ] and [ exp ] , we find the kernel estimate @xmath11 for galaxies with de vaucouleurs luminosity profiles and for galaxies with exponential profiles , and find the implications for their intrinsic shapes . in section  [ discuss ] , we discuss our results .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey which will , when completed , cover one quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic hemisphere , and produce a smaller ( @xmath14 ) but much deeper survey in the south galactic hemisphere .",
    "the photometric mosaic camera ( @xcite ; see also project book  4 , `` the photometric camera '' ) images the sky by scanning along great circles at the sidereal rate .",
    "the imaging data are produced simultaneously in five photometric bands ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ; @xcite ) with effective wavelengths of 3543 , 4770 , 6231 , 7625 , and 9134  , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 because the absolute calibration of the sdss photometric system is still uncertain at the @xmath24 level .",
    "the sdss filters themselves are referred to as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "all magnitudes are given on the @xmath25 system @xcite .",
    "for additional discussion regarding the sdss photometric system see @xcite and @xcite . ] .",
    "in june 2001 , the sdss presented early data release ( edr ) to the general astronomical community , consisting 462 square degrees of imaging data in five bands .",
    "the data are acquired in three regions ; along the celestial equator in the southern galactic sky ; along the celestial equator in the northern galactic sky ; and in a region overlapping the space infrared telescope facility first look survey .",
    "galaxies in the edr were analyzed with the sdss photometric pipeline _ photo _",
    "this code fits two models to the two - dimensional image of each galaxy .",
    "one model has a de vaucouleurs profile : @xmath26 \\right ) \\label{eq : dev}\\ ] ] which is truncated beyond @xmath27 to go smoothly to zero at @xmath28 , and with some softening within @xmath29 .",
    "the second model has an exponential profile : @xmath30 which is truncated beyond @xmath31 to go smoothly to zero at @xmath32 .",
    "each model is assumed to have concentric isophotes with constant position angle @xmath33 and axis ratio @xmath0 . before the model is fit to the data , the model is convolved with a double - gaussian fit to the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "assessing each model with a @xmath34 fit gives @xmath35 , @xmath0 , and @xmath33 for the best - fitting model , as well as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the likelihood associated with the best - fitting de vaucouleurs and exponential model , respectively .",
    "we use the model fits in the @xmath21 band to divide the galaxies into two classes : the `` de vaucouleurs '' galaxies are those with @xmath38 and the `` exponential '' galaxies are those with @xmath39 . in our data analysis we chose the likelihood @xmath40 for well behaved distribution of galaxies and the spectroscopic redshift @xmath41 , to reduce the effects of gravitational lensing of foreground objects .",
    "in addition , we require that a fit using one of the galaxy models is better than a pure psf fit .",
    "the spectroscopic sample of the edr contains 13092 de vaucouleurs galaxies , and 6081 exponential galaxies , based on these criteria . although the classification in the sdss is based purely on the surface brightness profile , it is generally true that galaxies classified as `` elliptical '' in the standard morphological schemes are better fitted by de vaucouleurs profiles than by exponential profiles  @xcite , while galaxies morphologically classified as `` spiral '' are better fitted by exponential profiles .",
    "the sdss photometric analysis also provides an independent measure of the axis ratio ; one based on the second moments of the surface brightness distribution . the stokes parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given in terms of the flux - weighted second moments as @xmath44 if the isophotes of the galaxy are indeed concentric ellipses of constant position angle and axis ratio , then the axis ratio @xmath45 is related to the values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 by the relation @xmath46 unlike the axis ratios @xmath47 found by fitting models , the values of @xmath45 do not attempt to correct for the effects of seeing .    for the galaxies in the sdss edr ,",
    "the value of @xmath45 is generally larger than @xmath47 as shown in figure  [ qsqm ] .",
    "to investigate the origin of this difference , we used the elliptical isophote fitting routine in imaging and reduction analysis facility ( iraf ) to plot @xmath0 versus @xmath48 for a subset of galaxies in the sample .",
    "figure  [ qvsr ] shows the result for just four of the de vaucouleurs galaxies examined .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines indicate @xmath45 plus and minus the estimated error @xmath49 in @xmath45 ; the horizontal dotted lines indicate @xmath47 plus and minus the estimated error @xmath49 in @xmath47 . for these four galaxies , as for most galaxies in the sdss , @xmath45 is greater than @xmath47 . as is also typical , @xmath50 found by fitting individual isophotes decreases as a function of radius ; most elliptical galaxies are rounder in their central regions than in their outer regions  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath45 , based on the luminosity - weighted second moments , are primarily indicating the axis ratio of the central regions of each galaxy , where the surface brightness is highest .",
    "the values of @xmath47 , by contrast , are more strongly influence by the axis ratio in the outer regions . since , in this paper , we are not primarily interested in the central regions of the galaxies , we will adopt @xmath47 as our primary measure of the axis ratio .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in the sdss edr is strongly bimodal in the @xmath51 versus @xmath52 color - color diagram @xcite .",
    "the optimal color separation between the two peaks is at @xmath53 .",
    "the detection of a local minimum indicates that the two peaks correspond roughly to early - type ( e , s0 ) and late - type ( sa , sb , sc , irr ) galaxies .",
    "the late - type galaxies are the bluer group , reflecting their more recent star formation activity .",
    "the color criterion of @xcite provides another means of dividing our data set .",
    "in addition to distinguishing between de vaucouleurs and exponential galaxies , we can also distinguish between red ( @xmath2 ) and blue ( @xmath1 ) galaxies .",
    "unsurprisingly , the de vaucouleurs galaxies are predominantly red and the exponential galaxies are predominantly blue . of the 13092 de vaucouleurs galaxies , 10898 are red , but only 2194 are blue . of the 6081 exponential galaxies , 4697 are blue , while only 1384 are red .",
    "we use a standard nonparametric kernel technique to estimate the distribution of intrinsic axis ratios .",
    "general reviews of kernel estimators are given by @xcite and @xcite ; applications to astronomical data are given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "here we give a brief overview , adopting the notation of @xcite . given a sample of axis ratios for @xmath54 galaxies , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the kernel estimate of the frequency distribution @xmath9 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the kernel function , normalized so that @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the kernel width , which determines the balance between smoothing and noise in the estimated distribution .",
    "one way of choosing @xmath62 is to use the value which minimizes the expected value of the integrated mean square error between the true @xmath63 and the estimated @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we follow @xcite in using the formula @xmath65 with @xmath66 , where @xmath49 is the standard deviation of the data and @xmath67 is the interquartile range . this formula for @xmath62",
    "minimizes the expected value of the mean square error for samples which are not strongly skewed @xcite .",
    "we choose a gaussian kernel , to ensure that @xmath68 is smooth and differentiable .    to obtain physically reasonable results , with @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we apply reflective boundary conditions @xcite . in practice",
    ", this means replacing the simple gaussian kernel with the kernel @xmath72 use of this kernel assures the correct normalization , @xmath73 .",
    "if we suppose that the @xmath54 galaxies in our sample are randomly oriented oblate spheroids , then the estimated frequency of intrinsic axis ratios , @xmath74 can be found by the mathematical inversion @xmath75 similarly , if the galaxies are assumed to be randomly oriented prolate spheroids , the estimated frequency of intrinsic axis ratios , @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 if the oblate hypothesis is incorrect , then the inversion of equation  ( [ eq : obl ] ) may result in @xmath78 which is negative for some values of @xmath5 . similarly ,",
    "if the prolate hypothesis is incorrect , @xmath79 , from equation  ( [ eq : pro ] ) , may be negative .    to exclude the oblate or prolate hypothesis at some statistical confidence level , we must take into account the errors in @xmath68 both from the finite sample size and from the errors in measuring @xmath0 for individual galaxies .",
    "the error due to finite sampling can be estimated by bootstrap resampling of the original data set . randomly taking @xmath54 data points , with replacement , from the original data set ,",
    "a new estimator @xmath68 is created from the bootstrapped data , and is then inverted to find new estimates of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . after creating a large number of bootstrap estimates for @xmath68 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ,",
    "error intervals can be placed on the original kernel estimates . in this paper",
    ", we did 300 bootstrap resamplings of each data set .",
    "an additional source of error in @xmath68 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the error that is inevitably present in the measured values of the apparent axis ratio .",
    "the sdss edr galaxies have an error @xmath80 associated with the axis ratio @xmath81 of each galaxy . to model the effect of errors , we replace the kernel width @xmath62 given by equation  ( [ eq : silver ] ) with a broader width @xmath82",
    "we can now apply the mathematical apparatus described in the previous section to our four subsamples of galaxies : red de vaucouleurs galaxies , blue de vaucouleurs galaxies , red exponential galaxies , and blue exponential galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , given the desirability of large @xmath54 in determining @xmath9 , not all the galaxies in the sdss edr are sufficiently well - resolved for their axis ratios to be reliably determined .",
    "a plot of @xmath47 versus @xmath35 , measured in units of the psf width ( psfw ) , as shown in figure  [ qmrepsfw ] , reveals that the galaxies with @xmath83 are mainly galaxies whose effective radius is not much larger than the psf width ( typically , @xmath84 ) .",
    "for instance , figure  [ allred ] shows the estimated distribution @xmath85 for all the red de vaucouleurs galaxies ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "in addition to the main peak at @xmath87 , there is a secondary peak at @xmath83 . to eliminate these spuriously round , poorly resolved galaxies , we retain in our samples only those galaxies with @xmath88 . after this purge of too - small galaxies , there are @xmath89 galaxies in the red de vaucouleurs subsample , @xmath90 galaxies in the blue de vaucouleurs subsample , @xmath91 galaxies in the red exponential subsample , and @xmath92 galaxies in the blue exponential subsample .",
    "the estimated distribution @xmath93 for the edited subsample of red de vaucouleurs galaxies ( excluding galaxies with @xmath94 ) is shown as the solid line in the upper panel of figure  [ reddev ] .",
    "note that the secondary peak at @xmath83 has disappeared .",
    "the dashed lines to either side of the solid line are the 80% confidence intervals , estimated by bootstrap resampling , while the dotted lines are the 98% confidence interval .",
    "the estimated distribution @xmath74 of intrinsic axis ratios , given the oblate hypothesis , is shown in the middle panel of figure  [ reddev ] .",
    "the 98% confidence interval drops below zero for @xmath95 ; thus the oblate hypothesis for this subsample of galaxies can be rejected at the 99% ( one - sided ) confidence interval .",
    "to produce as few nearly circular galaxies as are seen , there would have to be a negative number of nearly spherical oblate galaxies .",
    "the estimated distribution @xmath76 , given the prolate hypothesis , is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ reddev ] .",
    "the best estimate for @xmath79 , shown as the solid line , is positive everywhere .",
    "thus , the surface photometry of the red de vaucouleurs galaxies is consistent with their being a population of randomly oriented prolate spheroids .",
    "if they are all prolate , their average intrinsic axis ratio is @xmath96 although the shape distribution for red de vaucouleurs galaxies is consistent with the prolate hypothesis , it does nt require prolateness .",
    "the galaxies could also be triaxial and produce the same distribution of apparent shapes .",
    "plots of @xmath68 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are given in figure  [ bluedev ] for the 1784 blue de vaucouleurs galaxies .",
    "just as for the red de vaucouleurs galaxies , the oblate hypothesis can be rejected at the 99% confidence level , due to the scarcity of nearly circular galaxies in projection . the prolate hypothesis ,",
    "though , can not be rejected at the 90% confidence level for this sample ; see the bottom panel of figure  [ bluedev ] .",
    "if the blue de vaucouleurs galaxies are prolate , then @xmath79 yields an average intrinsic axis ratio @xmath97 , only slightly smaller than that for red de vaucouleurs galaxies . as a measured by kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test , however , the distribution of @xmath0 for blue de vaucouleurs galaxies is significantly different from that for red de vaucouleurs .",
    "the k - s probability from comparing the two samples is @xmath98 ; i.e. , the two samples are different at the 99.7% confidence level .",
    "unlike galaxies with de vaucouleurs profiles , which are generally smooth ellipticals , galaxies with exponential profiles are generally spiral galaxies , containing nonaxisymmetric structures such as spiral arms and bars .",
    "given such a large amount of substructure present in spiral galaxies , attempting to characterize their shape by a single axis ratio @xmath0 is a gross oversimplification .",
    "nevertheless , as long as it is not over - analyzed , the distribution @xmath11 contains useful information about the overall shape of exponential galaxies .",
    "for instance , figure  [ redexp ] shows the estimated value of @xmath93 for the 815 red exponential galaxies .",
    "the peak in @xmath68 is at @xmath99 , and relatively few red exponential galaxies have @xmath100 .",
    "the large apparent flattening of the galaxies in the red exponential subsample is a sign that they are not a population of randomly oriented disks .",
    "instead , the sample preferentially contains edge - on , or nearly edge - on disks .",
    "the red color of galaxies in this subsample is not the intrinsic color of the stars , but rather is the result of internal reddening by dust in the galaxy s disk . for a typical edge - on spiral galaxy like ngc 4594 ,",
    "the maximum reddening @xmath101 is 0.4 @xcite .",
    "then the corresponding reddening in the @xmath102 color will be @xmath103 1 , using the transformation @xmath104e(b - v)$ ] with @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , figure  [ blueexp ] shows the estimated value of @xmath93 for the 2263 blue exponential galaxies .",
    "the apparent shapes of blue exponential galaxies are very different from the apparent shapes of red exponential galaxies ; a k - s test comparing the two populations yields @xmath107 .",
    "the scarcity of exponential galaxies with @xmath108 is an indication that the exponential galaxies are not perfectly axisymmetric disks . indeed ,",
    "visual inspection of the sdss images reveals that most of the exponential galaxies contain readily visible nonaxisymmetric structure , in the form of spiral arms , bars , or tidal distortions .",
    "the galaxies in the sdss edr with de vaucouleurs profiles have a distribution of apparent shapes which is incompatible ( at the 99% confidence level ) with their being randomly oriented oblate spheroids .",
    "this is consistent with the result found by @xcite for a sample of 2135 elliptical galaxies with shapes estimated from survey plates of the apm bright galaxy survey . when the sdss survey is complete",
    ", it will provide a sample of galaxies @xmath109 times larger than the sdss edr .",
    "this increase in sample size will enable us to determine more accurately the distribution of apparent axis ratios @xmath9 .",
    "the kernel width @xmath62 will be decreased by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "the error intervals , which are essentially determined by the @xmath111 fluctuations in bins of width @xmath62 , will be reduced by a factor @xmath112 .",
    "although a simple increase in the sample size will not enable us to determine the true distribution of intrinsic shapes , it will enable us to make stronger statistical statements about our rejection or acceptance of the prolate or oblate hypothesis .",
    "the blue de vaucouleurs galaxies , with a mean axis ratio of @xmath113 , are only slightly flatter in shape than the red de vaucouleurs galaxies , with @xmath114 .",
    "thus , if the color of the blue de vaucouleurs galaxies is the result , at least in part , of recent star formation , we can conclude that the overall shape of the galaxies is not strongly affected by star formation .",
    "although elliptical galaxies with old stellar populations tend to be rounder than those with young stellar populations @xcite , this difference is only large at small radii ( @xmath115 ) , while the values of @xmath47 used in this paper emphasize the axis ratio at much larger radii ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the galaxies with exponential profiles have , by contrast , shapes which are strongly dependent on color , with the red exponential galaxies consisting predominantly of dust - reddened edge - on ( or nearly edge - on ) disks .",
    "a significant number of galaxies in the sdss edr appear to be edge - on late - type galaxies , with exponential profiles , rather than early - type galaxies , with de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "the number of red exponential galaxies ( @xmath91 ) is 14.4% of the number of red de vaucouleurs galaxies ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "thus , if we attempted to select out elliptical galaxies purely on the basis of color , we would have been faced with a significant contamination by reddened disks .",
    "spectroscopy or accurate surface photometry are required to distinguish between elliptical galaxies and disk galaxies .",
    "this analysis agrees very well with the result of @xcite and carries substantially more statistical weight .",
    "in summary , galaxies with de vaucouleurs profile have an axis ratio distribution consistent , at a high confidence level , with their being randomly oriented prolate spheroids ( though it is also consistent with their being triaxial systems ) .",
    "galaxies with exponential profiles have an axis ratio distribution which is dependent on color , suggesting that red exponential galaxies are nearly edge - on systems reddened by dust . since a fair number of red galaxies in the sdss edr are nearly edge - on exponential disks , it is dangerous to select elliptical galaxies purely on the basis of color .",
