    "the shell - like supernova remnant ( snr ) rx  j0852.04622 ( g266.21.2 ) at the south - east corner of the vela snr was discovered by aschenbach ( 1998 ) using data from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "high temperatures , @xmath8 k , obtained by aschenbach under the assumption that the snr spectrum is thermal , suggested that this is a young snr ( @xmath9 yr )",
    ". possible detection of the 1.156 mev @xmath10-ray line of the radioactive isotope @xmath11ti ( half - life @xmath12 yr ) with _ cgro _ comptel ( iyudin et al .  1998 ) may imply an even younger age , @xmath13 yr , at a distance of @xmath14 pc , estimated from the snr age and diameter , @xmath15 .",
    "aschenbach , iyudin , & schnfelder ( 1999 ) estimate upper limits of 1,100 yr for the age and 500 pc for the distance .",
    "thus , rx  j0852.04622 could be the remnant of the nearest supernova to have occurred in the recent human history . however , further observations with _ asca _ ( tsunemi et al .  2000 ;",
    "slane et al .",
    "2001 ) have shown that the x - ray spectra of the snr shell are nonthermal ( i.e. , the snr is not necessarily very hot ) .",
    "moreover , power - law fits of the spectra suggest that the hydrogen column density toward rx  j0852.04622 is an order of magnitude higher than that for the vela snr , implying that a plausible distance to the remnant is 12 kpc , so that an age of a few thousand years , inconsistent with the reported @xmath11ti line flux , is more likely .",
    "aschenbach et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that rx  j0852.04622 was created by a core - collapse supernova which left a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "aschenbach ( 1998 ) found a point - like source ( a1 hereafter ) in the rass data with a flux of @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 $ ] ) , off - set by @xmath18@xmath19 to the north from the snr center . a second rass source ( a2 ) ,",
    "even closer to the center , with a countrate of 0.12 s@xmath2 , was reported by aschenbach et al .",
    "if a1 or a2 is a ns , the low detected fluxes imply a very low surface temperature ( e.g. , @xmath20 k for @xmath21 @xmath3 , @xmath22 pc , and ns radius @xmath23 km ) or a large distance or a small emitting area .",
    "slane et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed an unresolved central source ( s ) surrounded by diffuse emission ; its position is marginally consistent with that of a1 .",
    "the blackbody ( bb ) fit of the s spectrum gives @xmath24 kev , @xmath25 , and unabsorbed flux @xmath26 in the 0.510 kev band .",
    "the power - law ( pl ) fit gives a photon index @xmath27 , @xmath287.5 , and @xmath29 .",
    "mereghetti ( 2001 ) observed the field with _ bepposax _ and detected a source ( m1 ) whose position is consistent with those of a1 and s. the spectral parameters and the flux values [ @xmath30 kev , @xmath31@xmath32 for the bb fit ; @xmath33 , @xmath31@xmath34 for the pl fit ] are consistent with those obtained by slane et al .",
    "mereghetti ( 2001 ) also reports detection of another source ( m2 ) , about @xmath35 north of m1 , which is seen at a @xmath36 level at @xmath37 kev .",
    "the flux of m2 is estimated as @xmath380.4 in the 210 kev band . because of its harder x - ray spectrum and higher x - ray - to - optical flux ratio , mereghetti considers m2 as a more likely candidate for the snr central source .",
    "based on the close positions of a1 , s and m1 and similar spectra of s and m1 , it is reasonable to assume that it is actually the same source .",
    "its nature has remained elusive because there are several stars within the x - ray error circles , including two bright early - type stars , hd 76060 ( @xmath39 ) and wray 16 - 30 ( @xmath40 ) , which could provide the observed x - ray flux .",
    "alternatively , this source could be a background agn or a compact remnant of the sn explosion , although it is not easy to reconcile its properties with those of `` canonical '' young nss .",
    "the nature of two other sources , a2 and m2 , is even more uncertain . to understand which ( if any ) of the three sources is a viable candidate for the compact remnant and infer its properties",
    ", we proposed observations of this field with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( _ chandra _ ) . in this letter we present the results of a 3 ks snapshot observation with the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al .",
    "1992 ; bautz et al .",
    "1998 ) and report optical observations of this field .",
    "the _ chandra _ acis observation was taken on 2000 october 26 ( 2,994  s effective exposure ) .",
    "the central part ( @xmath41 ) of the snr was imaged on four chips of the imaging array acis - i and two chips of the spectroscopic array acis - s .",
    "the data were acquired in timed exposure mode , with the default frame readout time of 3.24 s.    figure  1 shows a @xmath42 region of the acis - i image with the only point - like source ( marked x ) clearly detected in this observation , together with the error circles for the previously claimed detections of point sources .",
    "the source cxou  j085201.4461753 ( we will call it source x for brevity ) is centered at ra(j2000)@xmath43 , dec(j2000)@xmath44 .",
    "for the processing software version used , the rms error of celestial location is smaller than @xmath45 , although in some cases the offset can be as large as @xmath46 .",
    "source  x lies within the error circles of a1 , s and m1 , so that it is likely the same source .",
    "it is imaged on chip i2 , about @xmath47 off - axis .",
    "although it is embedded in a strip of enhanced background , no sign of a small - scale structure is seen around the source .",
    "5truept 10truept    we found 448 photon events ( standard grades 02346 ) within a @xmath48 radius circle ( which includes about 95% of point source counts ) .",
    "we estimate that such an aperture contains , on average , 0.56 background counts .",
    "thus , the observed source countrate ( in the 25 aperture ) is @xmath49 s@xmath2 .",
    "measuring the spectrum and the flux of the source is complicated due to two reasons .",
    "first , the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) distorts the spectrum and reduces the energy resolution , particularly for sources imaged on a front - illuminated chip far from the frame store , like our source . to correct for this distortion",
    ", we applied the cti corrector ( townsley et al .",
    "2000 ) to the level 1 data .",
    "the cti - corrected spectrum is somewhat harder than the uncorrected one , although the difference in spectral parameters is of the order of statistical uncertainties .",
    "more severe distortion of the data is caused by ccd pile - up , which results in a reduced count rate in the image core and hardening of the spectrum .",
    "the observed countrate of our source , 0.485 counts / frame , is high enough for the pile - up effects to be quite substantial . indeed , using the spectral parameters inferred from the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ data , we estimated , with the aid of pimms , that the acis - i countrate of 0.15 s@xmath2 after pile - up corresponds to 0.290.30 s@xmath2 ( 0.940.97 counts / frame ) before pile - up . therefore , the spectral parameters obtained from the acis spectra neglecting pile - up [ @xmath50 , @xmath51 kev , @xmath52@xmath53 km , @xmath54@xmath55 for the bb fit ; @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath54@xmath58 for the pl fit ] are inaccurate .",
    "we attempted to evaluate the spectral parameters using the codes xpsf ( chartas 2001 , in preparation ) and isis ( davis 2001 ) to correct for the pile - up effects .",
    "unfortunately , these codes are not very efficient when the number of source counts is small , so that we obtained only crude estimates : @xmath5912 , @xmath605 , for the pl fit ; @xmath616 , @xmath620.5 kev , for the bb fit ; the observed flux @xmath63@xmath643 in both cases .",
    "the spectral parameters are compatible with those obtained by slane et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and mereghetti ( 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath65 value obtained in the pl fit is close to the total galactic hi column density in this direction , @xmath66 @xmath3 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; estimated with the aid of the w3nh tool ) .",
    "the bb fit yields a lower @xmath65 , but it is still considerably greater than the highest value , @xmath67 , found by lu & aschenbach ( 2000 ) for the southern part of the vela snr . since bb fits give lower @xmath65 values than any other simple spectral model , we conclude that the observed source is well beyond the vela snr ( the distance to vela is @xmath68 pc  cha , sembach , & danks 1999 ) , but it should be closer than the vela molecular ridge at a distance of @xmath692 kpc ( see slane et al .",
    "2000 for a more detailed discussion ) .    to search for other sources in the image ,",
    "we have used the wavdetect tool .",
    "we find only two sources in the full - band image , the source  x and another source with a statistical significance of 2.4@xmath70 .",
    "since mereghetti ( 2001 ) found the source m2 at higher energies only , we divided the data into two energy ranges @xmath71 kev and @xmath72 kev , and ran wavdetect on the two images separately .",
    "we find that only the source  x shows up in both images . in the low energy image",
    ", there is an additional source detected at ra(j2000)@xmath73 , dec(j2000)@xmath74 , with total @xmath75 counts and a statistical significance of 3.1@xmath70 . in the high energy image",
    ", no other statistically significant source is found .",
    "no sources are detected by wavdetect at positions compatible with sources a2 and m2 .    to put an upper limit to the flux at the positions corresponding to the sources a2 and m2",
    ", we examined the brightest point - like background enhancements within the error circles corresponding to the two sources .",
    "we found upper limits of 4 and 5 source counts in a @xmath48 radius extraction circle for a2 and m2 , respectively .",
    "these upper limits are too low to be consistent with the reported countrates for a2 and m2 .",
    "for instance , using the parameters @xmath763 , @xmath77 , @xmath7810  kev)=0.30.4 , assumed by mereghetti ( 2001 ) for the m2 source , we estimate that acis - i would detect 50300 counts in a 3 ks exposure .",
    "similarly , the pspc countrate of 0.12 s@xmath2 , reported by aschenbach for a2 , is incompatible with the acis - i upper limit of 0.0013 s@xmath2 at any reasonable spectral parameters .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that a2 and m2 are either highly variable sources or misdetections .",
    "therefore , we believe there is only one viable candidate source x for the compact remnant .",
    "we have surveyed optical catalogs to search for a possible optical counterpart of source x. the two brightest optical stars in the field , hd 76060 and wray 16 - 30 , are immediately excluded as counterpart candidates because they are @xmath79 and @xmath80 away from the x - ray source , respectively .",
    "no counterparts were found in the usno a-2 catalog  the nearest object is @xmath81 away .",
    "the digitized sky survey ( dss ) plates , obtained with the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) , show one possible candidate ( we will call it star z ) whose position , determined with an accuracy of about @xmath82 , differs from the source x position by @xmath83 .",
    "we found a record for this source in the roe / nrl cosmos ukst southern sky object catalog ( yentis et al .",
    "according to this catalog , star z has a b magnitude of 18.7 , and its position differs by @xmath84 from the source x position .",
    "the field around source x was observed , at our request , by j.  allyn smith with the ctio 0.9-m telescope .",
    "three 10-min and three 5-min exposures with the sloan dss ( sdss ) g , r and i filters , taken on 2001 march 27 with the ccd detector tek2k_3 ( plate scale @xmath85 per pixel ) , allow us to calculate the position of star z more accurately and estimate its colors .",
    "we obtained a plate solution based on usno a-2 positions of 22 field stars and found the coordinates of star z : ra(j@xmath86 , dec(j@xmath87 , with an accuracy of @xmath88 . taking @xmath45 as a nominal uncertainty of the _ chandra _ source position , the optical to x - ray offset of 24 ( 22 west , 10 north  see fig .",
    "2 ) is significant at about @xmath89 level .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that the actual error of the x - ray position can be as large as the offset observed .",
    "since no standards were observed during the ctio observations , we can not directly measure the true magnitudes of star z. however , plots of empirical color - magnitude dependences for the observed field show that star z is well within the strips formed by field stars , i.e. , most likely it is a main - sequence star . to estimate its true magnitudes and colors , we found an object in the ctio images with approximately the same apparent g , r , i magnitudes as star z ( the differences do not exceed 0.12 mag ) and identified this object in the usno a-2 catalog , which gives @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "( the difference of 0.2 mag between the b magnitudes of this object and star z is less than the typical photometric error of usno a-2 of about 0.25 mag ) .",
    "we also measured the g , r and i magnitudes of 45 field stars for which the usno b and r magnitudes are known .",
    "using the transformation from the sdss system to the johnson ",
    "morgan  cousins system ( fukugita  et  al .",
    "1996 ) , we transformed the measured g , r and i magnitudes to corresponding b and r magnitudes and computed a linear regression fit for a transformation from the converted b and r magnitudes to the usno b and r magnitudes .",
    "using this fit , we found @xmath92 and @xmath93 for star z , compatible with those estimated above .",
    "5truept 10truept    adopting these magnitudes for star z , we could estimate its spectral type and distance if the interstellar extinction were known .",
    "the extinction could be estimated from the @xmath65 value ( e.g. , @xmath94 , @xmath95  savage & mathis 1979 ) , but this value remains highly uncertain .",
    "for instance , if we assume @xmath96 ( compatible with the bb fit of the x - ray spectrum ) , then the dereddened magnitudes are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and star z could be a g0v star at @xmath99 kpc . at @xmath100 ( a minimum value compatible with the x - ray spectrum )",
    ", it could be a k2v star at @xmath101 kpc . if @xmath102 is as high as 10 ( as obtained from the pl fit ) , then @xmath103 , i.e. , the dereddened spectrum is so blue that it can not be the radiation from an ordinary star .",
    "moreover , since @xmath104 for the total galactic hydrogen column density , this estimate of the dereddened color would be applicable if star z were an extragalactic source ( e.g. an agn ) .",
    "however , even bluest agns have @xmath105 ( d.  schneider , private communication ) , which means that star z is not an agn , too , i.e. , such an assumption on the @xmath65 value is unrealistic .",
    "if star z is not the optical counterpart , then limiting magnitudes corresponding to the x - ray source position can be estimated as @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the ctio 0.9 m images .",
    "the nature of source x can be constrained from the ratio of its x - ray and optical fluxes , @xmath106 .",
    "although we do not consider star z as a plausible optical counterpart , based on its colors and positional offset , we can not completely rule out the association and will use its optical flux to obtain a lower limit on @xmath106 . with @xmath54@xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath110 , @xmath111 for the observed fluxes ( i.e. , uncorrected for interstellar extinction ) . the ratios for unabsorbed fluxes strongly depend on the poorly known hydrogen column density and the model assumed for the x - ray spectrum .",
    "for example , assuming a bb model with @xmath112 kev , @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath113 , @xmath114 if the unabsorbed x - ray flux is estimated for the 0.510 kev band .",
    "the estimated lower limits are high enough to conclude that source x is not a main - sequence star , which means that if even star z is a main - sequence optical counterpart , x - rays emerge from a different object ( e.g. , from a compact companion of a binary system ) .",
    "the estimated flux ratio does not rule out the possibility that the putative optical - x - ray source is a magnetic cataclysmic variable ( mcv )  @xmath106 can be as high as @xmath115 for such objects ( see , e.g. , warner 1995 for references )",
    ". however , the observed x - ray spectrum is too hard to be a soft component ( @xmath1160.04 kev ) of an mcv spectrum , and it is too soft to be a hard component ( dominant , typically , at @xmath117 kev ) which usually fits a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath11840 kev ( versus @xmath1192 kev for source x ) . in addition , if it were an mcv , its radiation should be strongly variable , whereas the observed _ asca _ , _ bepposax _ , and _ chandra _ fluxes do not show appreciable differences .    if star z is just a field star , not related to source x , then @xmath120 , @xmath121 , which excludes any star , except for a ns or a bh , as a source of the observed x - ray radiation .",
    "one could assume that source x is an agn , heavily absorbed by the interstellar material in the galactic plane . in this case",
    ", the unabsorbed soft - x - ray flux is so large [ e.g. , @xmath122@xmath123 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath2 for @xmath54@xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 that such an agn would be seen as an extremely bright source if it were at a high galactic latitude ( e.g. , the _ rosat _ pspc countrate would be about 15 s@xmath2 for @xmath127 at the flux and photon index assumed above ) .",
    "the probability to find such a bright agn , which , in addition , has a spectrum much steeper , and @xmath128 much larger than a usual agn , within an area of a few square arcminutes is practically negligible .",
    "thus , we conclude that source x is not a field agn , and thus very likely it is the compact remnant of the supernova explosion .",
    "given the steep slope of the x - ray spectrum , low luminosity [ @xmath129@xmath130@xmath131 erg  s@xmath2 for the pl model ] , and the lack of a pulsar - wind nebula around source x , we do not expect it to be a young active ( radio- and/or @xmath10-ray ) pulsar . on the other hand",
    ", its bb temperature , @xmath132 kev , is too high for a cooling ns of a reasonable age , and the emitting radius , @xmath133 km , is too small to explain the radiation as emitted from the whole surface of an isolated ns .",
    "interestingly , the spectral properties of source  x resemble those of the compact central object in the very young cas a snr  e.g. , the bb fit of the cas a source spectrum gives a slightly higher temperature , @xmath134 kev , with a comparable emitting area and luminosity ( pavlov et al .",
    "the nature of the cas a central source remains elusive .",
    "various hypotheses ( an isolated ns with hot spots , an anomalous x - ray pulsar , a compact object slowly accreting from a fossil disk or a dwarf binary companion ) , which also pertain to source  x and some other radio - silent nss in snrs , have been discussed in literature ( murray et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) . to conclude ,",
    "the x - ray and optical observations show that cxou  j085201.4461753 , the only bright x - ray object close to the center of the rx  j08524622 snr , is most likely a compact remnant of the supernova explosion .",
    "its properties are different from those of a classical rotation - powered pulsar or a cooling ns with a uniformly heated surface .",
    "likely , it is a member of the newly emerging class of radio- ( and @xmath10-ray ) quiet young isolated nss in snrs . to elucidate the nature of this source , additional x - ray observations are required to get a more accurate spectrum and to search for periodic and aperiodic variability .",
