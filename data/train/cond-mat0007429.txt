    "the use of statistical mechanics tools to understand the main ideas underlying problems as diverse as biological , social and economic systems has become a common task , both theoretically and computationally @xcite .",
    "recently , these tools have been applied to computer science problems @xcite , not intending to solve them exactly , but to understand their complexity and the underlying mechanisms generating such complex behavior . in this paper",
    "we focus on the number partitioning problem , a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to apply the multicanonical method ( muca )  @xcite of statistical physics on this problem and study the behavior of nearly optimal solutions .",
    "this information is important for the development of new algorithms which try to find optimal solutions .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the number partitioning problem and its formulation as a spin glass problem .",
    "we also introduce the multi - partitioning problem and map it onto a @xmath2-states potts model . in section [ sec - esm ]",
    "we present the lee formulation of the multicanonical method and apply it to our problem . on section [ sec - conclusions ]",
    "we discuss our results both for the classical and for the multi - partitioning problem .",
    "the number partitioning problem ( npp ) is , according to garey and johnson @xcite , one of the six basic computer science problems . given a set @xmath4 with @xmath5 integer numbers ,",
    "the traditional npp consists of partitioning the set @xmath6 into two disjoint sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that the difference @xmath9 is minimized .",
    "if there are @xmath10 numbers in the set @xmath7 and @xmath11 numbers in the set @xmath8 , then @xmath12 is called the _",
    "cardinality _ of the set .    on the unbalanced npp",
    "the only condition is to minimize the cost function ( eq .  [ eq - unpp ] ) without any restriction to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the problem of finding good solutions ( whenever they exist ) for the unbalanced ( non - fixed @xmath1 ) npp was essentially solved by the deterministic karmakar - karp - korf complete algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was generalized by mertens for the balanced ( @xmath1 fixed ) case @xcite .",
    "some recent papers addressed the possibility of carrying a statistical analysis of this problem  @xcite obtaining interesting results , such as : the existence of an easy - to - hard transition @xcite , the non self averaging property of the ground state energy @xcite , the analytical derivation of the lower bounds for the energy as a function of the cardinality  @xcite and the equivalence of the npp to a random cost problem  @xcite .",
    "for that purpose , it was proposed a mapping of the npp problem onto a spin - glass model : associate to each number @xmath13 a new variable @xmath14 ( which we call `` spin '' ) such that if @xmath15 them @xmath16 , otherwise @xmath17 . with this mapping , we can search for a configuration of spins @xmath18 which minimizes the cost function ( or energy ) @xmath19 or its square , @xmath20 with @xmath21 , which we recognize as an infinite - range spin - glass hamiltonian .",
    "we can also write down the cardinality on a `` magnetization - like '' fashion @xmath22 finding an optimal solution for the number partitioning problem consists of finding the spin configuration of the fundamental state on the spin - glass problem .",
    "this is a very difficult task , mainly because of the great number of metastable states separated by a hierarchy of increasingly high energy barriers @xcite .",
    "a much more difficult problem is multi - partitioning .",
    "this problem consists of partitioning the set of numbers @xmath6 into @xmath2 disjoint sets such that the energy and magnetization associated to these partition assume the values @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this problem has several applications @xcite , such as the division of @xmath5 different jobs ( computer programs ) into @xmath2 computers .",
    "we can map this problem onto a potts spin - glass by assigning to each number @xmath13 a spin @xmath14 which can assume integer values from @xmath23 to @xmath2 .",
    "these spin magnitudes represent the set to which the number belongs .",
    "hence , the energy can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sum of the elements in the set @xmath26 . in the same way we define the magnetization as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of elements in the set @xmath26 .",
    "clearly this problem is much more complex than the traditional npp ( @xmath29 ) .    in the next section",
    "we show that the multicanonical method can be used to determine the spectral degeneracy of the problem , i.e. , the number of solutions @xmath30 which have a given energy @xmath0 and magnetization @xmath1 . in the statistical mechanics sense , this completely characterizes the problem since the ( adimensional ) entropy is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the multicanonical method was introduced in 1991 by berg and neuhaus@xcite , and the basic idea of this method is to sample micro - configurations of a given system performing a biased random walk ( rw ) in the configuration space which leads to another unbiased random walk ( i.e. with uniform distribution ) along the energy axis .",
    "this walk must have a visiting probability of each energy level @xmath0 which is inversely proportional to @xmath32 , the quoted spectral degeneracy .",
    "if one can measure the transitions probabilities from an energy level @xmath0 to all other energy levels , one is able to obtain @xmath32 .",
    "the multicanonical method has been shown to be very efficient in obtaining satisfactory results for @xmath32 in a large variety of problems such as evolutionary problems @xcite , phase equilibrium in binary lipid bilayer @xcite and optimization problems  @xcite ( for reviews of the method see @xcite ) . the entropic sampling method ( esm )",
    "@xcite , which we will use throughout this paper , has been proven to be an equivalent formulation of muca @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the multiparametric formulation of the multicanonical method , since we must obtain the spectral degeneracy @xmath30 @xcite as a function of two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the energy and magnetization associated to the microstate @xmath35 , the transition probability between two states @xmath36 and @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 }                  = \\frac{g(e_i , m_i)}{g(e_f , m_f)}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the entropy , @xmath39(@xmath40 ) is the energy of the initial ( final ) state , @xmath41(@xmath42 ) is the magnetization of the initial ( final ) state and @xmath30 is the spectral degeneracy .",
    "the transitional probability ( eq . [ estransition ] ) satisfies a detailed balance equation and leads to a distribution of probabilities where a state is sampled with probability @xmath43 .",
    "the successive visitations along the energy axis follow a uniform distribution , but unfortunately @xmath30 is not known _",
    "a priori_. one way of obtaining @xmath30 is to construct it iteratively , such as in the `` entropic sampling '' method proposed by lee  @xcite .",
    "this method can be summarized as follows :    _ step 1 : _ start with @xmath44 for all states ;    _ step 2 : _ perform a few unbiased rw steps in the configuration space and store @xmath45 , the number of tossed movements to each state with energy @xmath0 and magnetization @xmath1 ( in this stage all movements are accepted ) ;    _ step 3 : _ update @xmath46 according to    @xmath47    _ step 4 : _ perform a much longer mc run using the transitional probability given by eq .",
    "( [ estransition ] ) , storing @xmath45 .",
    "_ step 5 : _ repeat 3 and 4 .",
    "this is considered one iteration .",
    "usually , the number of monte carlo steps used in step 4 increases with the number of iterations . for a detailed description of the method see refs .",
    "we applied this algorithm to the problem of bi- and multi - partitioning in order to obtain the entropy @xmath46 , which is shown for the case of bi - partitioning in figure [ fig - entropy ] .",
    "these results were obtained for a single instance ( disorder realisation ) of @xmath48 integer numbers chosen randomly between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "all results shown are typical ones .",
    "it is important to stress that , after obtaining the entropy of the system through extensive simulations , all thermodynamic averages for different cardinalities @xmath1 can be executed with no need to any further computer effort .    in the next section",
    "we are going to analyze this entropy in order to recover well - known results concerning bounds of the @xmath51 curve for nearly optimal solutions . through analysis of the entropy of the multi - partitioning problem",
    "it will be clear that the change of complexity of this problem for @xmath3 is associated to fundamental changes of the entropy curve .",
    "in  @xcite , ferreira and fontanari have calculated through the replica trick analytical estimates for the average lower bound of the energy @xmath0 as a function of magnetization ( cardinality ) @xmath1 . by collapsing the @xmath52axis on the @xmath53 plane ( here the @xmath51 plane )",
    "we are able to see this limit and also the upper bound for @xmath0 . in figure [ fig - bounds ] we show our numerical results and the analytical prediction of ferreira and fontanari .",
    "the energy is normalized appropriately .    in computer science one",
    "is only interested in the optimal solutions , that is , the information contained on the first `` slice '' of the @xmath46 surface , the @xmath54 plane . in figure [ fig - em ]",
    "we show @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is our numerical tolerance , which we chose to be @xmath57 .",
    "one interesting feature we have observed numerically is that the maximum number of solutions does not occur for @xmath58 ; it is easier to find solutions where the number of elements on each set is not exactly equal .",
    "this feature is not characteristic of a particular instance .",
    "now we show our results for the multi - partitioning problem , where no reasonable deterministic algorithm that finds optimal solutions exists for any instance . as far as we know , there is no theoretical study of the npp for @xmath3 .",
    "if we look at the number of solutions @xmath59 ( or the entropy @xmath60 ) for different cardinalities , we observe a fundamental difference between @xmath29 and @xmath3 results ( figure [ fig - q ] ) .",
    "for the case @xmath29 , we confirm recent results obtained by mertens @xcite , who showed that the traditional number - partitioning problem ( @xmath29 ) is essentially equivalent to the random cost problem , the problem of finding the minimum in an exponentially long list of random numbers , where no other algorithm than random search can be more efficient . as the maximum of the entropy lies near @xmath61 in the npp ( @xmath29 ) problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig - entropy ] ) , any algorithm based on random movements will drive the system close to the fundamental state .    for @xmath3",
    "we have a completely different scenario .",
    "the maximum of the entropy is not near @xmath61 , indeed , @xmath61 is a minimum and the number of solutions with @xmath62 decreases , at least , exponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "this means that any algorithm based on random movements would drive the system away from the fundamental state on the @xmath3 case .",
    "the effects of this behavior for the construction of new algorithms have to be taken into account . on the traditional differencing scheme",
    "@xcite we can say that , if the number of nearly optimal solutions increases exponentially as @xmath63 , it is always possible to find better and better solutions , the computational time spent on the search being the only barrier . for the @xmath3 npp this kind of procedure does not seem to work , since the number of solutions _ decreases _ exponentially for @xmath64 .",
    "we showed in this paper that the multicanonical method for obtaining thermodynamic averages of statistical systems can provide a tool for assessing the complexity of computer science problems , such as the number - partitioning problem ( npp ) .",
    "this problem is one of the six basic computer science problems , according to garey and johnson @xcite , and can be formulated as a spin - glass problem .",
    "based on this analogy we proposed a statistical mechanics method for computing the spectral degeneracy of the npp problem which gives us information about the number of solutions for a given cost @xmath0 and cardinality @xmath1 .",
    "we have also studied an extension of this problem for @xmath2 partitions , where there exists no good deterministic algorithm which finds optimal solutions .",
    "we observed a fundamental difference between the classical ( @xmath29 ) and the generalized ( @xmath3 ) npp , which explains why it is so difficult to find good solutions for the latter case .",
    "this information can be very useful in the construction of new algorithms .",
