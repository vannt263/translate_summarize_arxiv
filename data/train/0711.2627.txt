    "a satisfactory theory of galaxy formation requires a good understanding of the complex physical processes governing the collapse of primordial density perturbations and the early galaxy evolution .",
    "measurements of the galaxy luminosity and stellar - mass functions up to substantial redshifts have highlighted that these functions show conspicuous differences with respect to the halo mass functions predicted by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory with the `` concordance '' cosmological parameters . at the low - mass end ,",
    "the halo mass functions is much steeper than the galaxy luminosity function . as discussed by many authors ( larson 1974 : dekel & silk 1986 ; cole 1991 ; white & frenk 1991 ; lacey & silk 1991 ; kauffmann et al . 1993 ; cole et al . 1994 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; granato et al . 2001 ; benson et al . 2003 ) , the relative paucity of low - luminosity galaxies may be attributed to the quenching of star formation in low - mass halos by energy injections from supernovae and stellar winds , and by photoionization of the pre - galactic gas .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that efficient star formation must await the collapse of massive halos .",
    "on the other hand , the above processes have little effect on very massive halos , which , in the absence of additional relieving mechanisms , would convert too large fractions of gas into stars , yielding too many bright galaxies , with wrong metallicities ( thomas et al .",
    "2002 ; see benson et al .",
    "2003 and cirasuolo et al .",
    "2005 for discussions of the effect of quenching mechanisms ) .",
    "an effective cure for that is the feedback from active nuclei ( agns ) , growing at the galaxy centers ( granato et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ; bower et al . 2006 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ) .    during their very early evolutionary phases ,",
    "massive proto - galaxies are expected to contain large amounts of hot gas , but the gas thermal history is obscure . according to the standard scenario ( rees & ostriker 1977 ; white & rees 1978 ) , the proto - galactic gas is shock heated to the virial temperature , but this view has been questioned ( katz et al .",
    "2002 ; binney 2004 ; birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere et al . 2005 ) , on the basis of independent approaches : analytic methods , a high - resolution one - dimensional code , smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "the general conclusion is that only a fraction , increasing with halo mass , of the gas heats to the virial temperature .",
    "the hot gas is further heated by supernova explosions and by the agn feedback , and may eventually be pushed out of the halo .",
    "kere et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and dekel & birnboim ( 2006 ) find that there is a critical shock heating halo mass of @xmath0 , above which most of the gas is heated to the virial temperature , while most of the gas accreted by less massive halos is cooler .",
    "the large thermal energy content of the hot proto - galactic gas in massive halos makes this crucial evolutionary phase potentially observable by the next generation of astronomical instruments through its free - free emission and the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effects ( oh 1999 ; majumdar , nath , & chiba 2001 ; platania et al .",

    "we investigate the detectability of this proto - galactic gas exploiting an up to date model . for the purposes of the present analysis",
    ", the adopted model can be taken as representative of the most popular semi - analytic models ( white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ; cole et al . 1994",
    "; somerville & primack 1999 ; benson et al . 2003 ) , that all adopt a similar mass function of dark matter halos , a cosmological gas to dark matter ratio at virialization , and assume that all the gas is heated to the virial temperature .    even if some single dish telescopes have the required theoretical sensitivity , especially at mm and sub - mm wavelengths ( e.g. lmt / gtm , gbt at 3 mm , rosa - gonzlez et al .",
    "2004 ) these continuum observations will be hampered by fluctuations in tropospheric emission .",
    "interferometric array observations offer a better trade off between angular resolution , sensitivity and control of systematics ( birkinshaw & lancaster 2005 ) together with larger fields of view , and allow us to work at lower frequencies where the sources of contaminations from backgrounds and foregrounds are lower and may be better estimated . for this reason we focus mainly on the capabilities of next generation interferometers : the square kilometer array ( ska ) , the atacama large millimiter array ( alma ) , the expanded very large array ( evla ) , the new 7 mm capability of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "we note that the situation for galaxy scale sz detection is quite different from that for cluster sz detection .",
    "cluster sz signals are stronger and have much larger angular scales than optimum for the interferometer arrays and are best observed with single dishes at high quality sites ( carlstrom , holder & reese 2002 ) .    the outline of the paper is the following : in @xmath1[sec : model ] we briefly describe our reference model ; in @xmath1[sec : counting ] , we present our predictions for the counts of proto - galaxies seen through their free - free emission and their thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effects ; in @xmath1[sec : survey ] we analyze the potential of the next generation interferometers for detecting such signals , describe possible survey strategies , and discuss possible contaminating emissions and confusion effects ; in @xmath1[sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we adopt a @xmath2-cdm cosmology with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , consistent with the results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) ( spergel et al .",
    "we adopt the semi - analytic model laid out in granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with the values of the parameters revised by lapi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to satisfy the constraints set by the agn luminosity functions . for the reader s convenience ,",
    "we summarize here its main features .",
    "the model is built in the framework of the standard hierarchical clustering scenario , taking also into account the results by wechsler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and zhao et al .",
    "( 2003a ; 2003b ) , whose simulations have shown that the growth of a halo occurs in two different phases : a first regime of fast accretion in which the potential well is built up by the sudden mergers of many clumps with comparable masses ; and a second regime of slow accretion in which mass is added in the outskirts of the halo , without affecting the central region where the galactic structure resides .",
    "this means that the halos harboring a massive galaxy , once created even at high redshift , are rarely destroyed . at low redshifts",
    "they are incorporated within groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "support to this view comes from studies of the mass structure of elliptical galaxies , which are found not to show strong signs of evolution since redshift @xmath8 ( koopmans et al .",
    "the halo formation rate at @xmath9 , when most massive early - type galaxies formed ( renzini 2006 ) , is well approximated by the positive term in the cosmic time derivative of the cosmological mass function ( e.g. , haehnelt & rees 1993 ; sasaki 1994 ) .",
    "we confine our analysis to galaxy halo masses between @xmath10 , close to the mass scale at the boundary between the blue ( low mass , late type ) and the red ( massive , early type ) galaxy sequences ( dekel & birnboim 2006 ) and @xmath11 , the observational upper limit to halo masses associated to individual galaxies ( cirasuolo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the complex physics of baryons is described by a set of equations summarized in the appendix of lapi et al .",
    "briefly , the model assumes that during or soon after the formation of the host dark matter ( dm ) halo , the baryons falling into the newly created potential well are shock - heated to the virial temperature .",
    "the hot gas is ( moderately ) clumpy and cools quickly in the denser central regions , triggering a strong burst of star formation .",
    "the radiation drag due to starlight acts on the gas clouds , reducing their angular momentum . as a consequence",
    ", a fraction of the cool gas falls into a reservoir around the central supermassive black hole ( bh ) , and eventually accretes onto it by viscous dissipation , powering the nuclear activity .",
    "the energy fed back to the gas by supernova ( sn ) explosions and agn activity regulates the ongoing star formation and the bh growth .",
    "eventually , the sn and the agn feedbacks unbind most of the gas from the dm potential well .",
    "the evolution turns out to be faster in the more massive galaxies , where both the star formation and the bh activity come to an end on a shorter timescale , due to the qso feedback whose kinetic power is proportional , according to the model , to @xmath12 .",
    "mao et al . ( 2007 ) found that , for the masses and redshifts of interest here , the evolution of the hot ( virial temperature ) gas mass , taking into account both heating and cooling processes , is well approximated by a simple exponential law @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gas mass at virialization , @xmath15 being the halo mass and @xmath16 the mean cosmological baryon to dark matter mass density ratio . the evolution timescale @xmath17 can be approximated as @xmath18 the model proved to be remarkably successful in accounting for a broad variety of data , including epoch dependent luminosity functions and number counts in different bands of spheroidal galaxies and of agns , the local black hole mass function , metal abundances , fundamental plane relations and relationships between the black hole mass and properties of the host galaxies ( granato et al .",

    "( [ eq : s_tsz ] ) and ( [ eq : s_ksz ] ) ] . such brightening is stronger for the thermal than for the kinetic sz .",
    "a consequence of such brightening is that the range of halo masses yielding signals above a given limit shrinks with decreasing redshift , as the minimum detectable halo mass increases .",
    "the upper limit on masses of galactic halos then translates in a lower limit to the redshift distribution for bright @xmath145 .",

    "however , already at 20 ghz the thermal dust emission becomes important for the highest redshift sources .",
    "such emission is more steeply increasing with frequency than the sz signal , even in the rayleigh - jeans region of the cmb , and rapidly overwhelms it at @xmath175ghz . the sz / contamination ratio increases with increasing halo mass ; therefore the sz detection is easier for the more massive halos .",
    "thus in the range 1035 ghz the thermal sz is expected to dominate over the contaminating signal at least for the most massive objects .",
    "it must be noted that the star forming regions are concentrated in the core of the spheroids , on angular scales of the order or less than @xmath176 , for the redshifts considered here .",

    "is necessary together with a good sampling of the largest ones : with the latter it might be possible to reconstruct the contaminated profile , subtract it from the former and produce an uncontaminated sz profile .",

    "further constraints to the detection of sz effects are set by confusion fluctuations .",

    "( [ eq : fomalont ] ) .",
    "we then have : @xmath185 where @xmath186 , in @xmath182jy , is the detection limit and @xmath187 is the solid angle subtended by the sz signal . equation  ( [ eq : conf ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath188 yielding a @xmath189 detection limit of @xmath190jy at 10 ghz and of @xmath191jy at 20 ghz .",
    "for the `` optimal '' survey depths at higher frequencies @xmath192 , implying that they are not affected by confusion noise due to radio sources .    on the other hand ,",
    "as noted above , at high frequencies the redshifted dust emission from distant star - forming galaxies becomes increasingly important ( de zotti et al .",
    "2005 ) . to estimate their contribution to the confusion noise",

    "thus at 20 ghz we have significant contributions to the confusion noise both from the radio and from the dust emission ; the overall @xmath189 detection limit is @xmath196jy . at 10 ghz",
    "the contribution of dusty galaxies to the confusion noise is negligible , while at 100 ghz the confusion limit is as high as 2 mjy , implying that the detection of the galactic - scale sz effect is hopeless at mm wavelengths .    although high-@xmath95 luminous star - forming galaxies may be highly clustered ( blain et al . 2005 ;",
    "farrah et al . 2006 ; magliocchetti et al .",
    "2007 ) , the clustering contribution to fluctuations is negligible on the small scales of interest here ( de zotti et al . 1996 ) , and can safely be neglected .",
    "in the standard scenario for galaxy formation , the proto - galactic gas is shock heated to the virial temperature .",
    "the observational evidences that massive star formation activity must await the collapse of large halos , a phenomenon referred to as _ downsizing _ , suggest that proto - galaxies with a high thermal energy content existed at high redshifts",
    ". such objects are potentially observable through the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effects and their free - free emission .",
    "the detection of this phase of galaxy evolution would shed light on the physical processes that govern the collapse of primordial density perturbations on galactic scales and on the history of the baryon content of galaxies .",
    "as for the latter issue , the standard scenario , adopted here , envisages that the baryon to dark matter mass ratio at virialization has the cosmic value , i.e. is about an order of magnitude higher than in present day galaxies .",
    "measurements of the sz effect will provide a direct test of this as yet unproven assumption , and will constrain the epoch when most of the initial baryons are swept out of the galaxies .    as mentioned in  [ sec : intro ] , almost all semi - analytic models for galaxy formation adopt halo mass functions directly derived or broadly consistent with the results of n - body simulations , and it is commonly assumed that the gas is shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "they therefore entail predictions on counts of sz effects similar to those presented here .",
    "on the other hand , the thermal history of the gas is governed by a complex interplay of many astrophysical processes , including gas cooling , star formation , feedback from supernovae and active nuclei , shocks . as mentioned in  [ sec : intro ] , recent investigations have highlighted that a substantial fraction of the gas in galaxies may not be heated to the virial temperature .",
    "also , it is plausible that the agn feedback transiently heats the gas to temperatures substantially above the virial value , thus yielding sz signals exceeding those considered here . the gas thermal history may therefore be substantially different from that envisaged by semi - analytic models , and the sz observations may provide unique information on it .",
    "we have presented a quantitative investigation of the counts of sz and free - free signals in the framework of the granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model , that successfully accounts for the wealth of data on the cosmological evolution of spheroidal galaxies and of agns ( granato et al . 2004 ; cirasuolo et al . 2005 ; silva et al . 2005 ; lapi et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we find that the detection of substantial numbers of galaxy - scale thermal sz signals is achievable by blind surveys with next generation radio interferometers .",
    "since the protogalaxy thermal energy content increases , for given halo mass , with the virialization redshift , the sz `` fluxes '' increase rather strongly with @xmath95 , especially for the thermal sz effect , partially compensating for the rapid decrease of the density of massive halos with increasing redshift .",
    "the redshift distributions of thermal sz sources are thus expected to have substantial tails up to high @xmath95 .",
    "there are however important observational constraints that need to be taken into account .",
    "the contamination by radio and dust emissions associated to the star formation activity depends on mass and redshift of the objects , but is expected to be stronger than the sz signal at very low and very high frequencies .",
    "we conclude that the optimal frequency range for detecting the sz signal is from 10 to 35 ghz , where such signal dominates over the contamination at least for the most massive objects .",
    "it must be noted however that contaminating emissions have typical scales of the order of those of the stellar distributions , i.e. @xmath197 at the redshifts of interest here ( see fomalont et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the sz effects show up on the scale of the dark matter halo , which is typically ten times larger .",
    "therefore arcsec resolution images , such as those that will be provided by the ska , will allow to reconstruct the uncontaminated sz signal .",
    "the coexistence of the hot plasma halo , responsible for the sz signal , with dust emission implies that the scenario presented in this paper may be tested by means of pointed observations of high-@xmath95 luminous star - forming galaxies detected by ( sub)-mm surveys .",
    "confusion noise is a very serious limiting factor at mm wavelengths .",
    "contributions to confusion come on one side from radio sources and on the other side from dusty galaxies . at 10 ghz only radio sources matter ; a modest extrapolation of the 8.4 ghz @xmath182jy counts by fomalont et al .",
    "( 2002 ) gives a @xmath198 detection limit @xmath196jy , for a sz signal subtending a typical solid angle of @xmath199 .",
    "fluctuations due to dust emission from high-@xmath95 luminous star - forming galaxies may start becoming important already at 20 ghz ; at this frequency , quadratically summing them with those due to radio sources we find again @xmath196jy , for the same solid angle . on the other hand ,",
    "the high resolution of the ska and of the evla will allow us to effectively detect and subtract out confusing sources , thus substantially decreasing the confusion effects",
    ". beating confusion will be particularly important for searches of the weaker kinetic sz signal .",
    "we are indebted to g.  l. granato for having provided the software to compute the cooling function and the halo mass function , to a. diaferio for explanations on the halo velocity function and its cosmological evolution , and to a. bressan for clarifications on the dependence of the radio - luminosity / sfr relation on the imf .",
