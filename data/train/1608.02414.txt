    "the electrical noise spectrum in quantum systems is accessible experimentally through very sensitive techniques such as spectrum analyzer  @xcite , use of a superconductor - insulator - superconductor tunnel junction as an on - chip spectrum analyzers  @xcite and measurement of photon emission spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it exists also a proposal to measure the heat statistics in quantum devices  @xcite .",
    "given the fast progress of detection techniques , it is not forbidden to imagine that in the next few years , the measurement of the noise correlator between the electrical current and the heat current ( mixed noise ) would be possible .    in parallel ,",
    "calculations of finite frequency electrical / heat mixed noise are needed for quantum systems . there",
    "exist very few works on the zero - frequency mixed noise  @xcite and not even one concerning the finite - frequency mixed noise .",
    "theoretically , the studies are limited to the electrical noise spectrum ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , to the energy noise spectrum  @xcite , to the statistics of the energy current in the presence of time - dependent excitation  @xcite , and to the heat noise spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this is regrettable since it has been shown recently that the zero - frequency mixed noise contains information on the thermoelectric response of the system  @xcite : it gives the figure of merit in the linear response regime and it is related to the thermoelectric efficiency in the weak transmission regime ( schottky regime ) . at finite - frequency , the mixed noise should bring information on the dynamics of the thermoelectric conversion , in particular on the thermoelectric response of time - modulated systems , which is the study of an increasing number of works @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we fill this lacuna by calculating the mixed noise spectrum of a quantum dot ( qd ) using the keldysh out - of - equilibrium green function technique .",
    "we focus on the non - symmetrized noise spectrum since this is the quantity which is relevant for quantum systems , due to the fact that the current operators do not commute with each other @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the model and give the definition of electrical and heat currents in sec .",
    "the results for the noise spectra are presented in sec .",
    "iii , and discussed in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "to model the qd connected to left ( l ) and right ( r ) reservoirs , we use the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 describes the energy of electrons in the reservoir @xmath2 , with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , the creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath5 describes the qd with a single energy level @xmath6 , with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) the creation ( annihilation ) operator , and @xmath9 describes the transfer of electrons from the reservoirs to the qd and vice versa .",

    "the non - symmetrized noise spectrum is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the current - current time - correlator , and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , the electrical ( @xmath29 ) or heat ( @xmath30 ) current operator from the reservoir @xmath2 to the central region through the barrier  @xmath2 . the finite - frequency non - symmetrized noise @xmath31 quantifies the correlation between the currents @xmath32 and @xmath33 at finite frequency @xmath34 .",
    "such a general definition embeds three types of noises : ( i ) the charge noise , @xmath35 , corresponding to the correlator between the electrical current and itself ; ( ii ) the mixed noises , @xmath36 and @xmath36 , corresponding to the correlators between the electrical current and the heat current , and ( iii ) the heat noise , @xmath37 , corresponding to the correlator between the heat current and itself .",
    "we first compute the time - correlator @xmath38 using the keldysh out - of - equilibrium formalism @xcite , and next calculate its fourier transform in order to get @xmath31 . to achieve this task , we insert the current operator , given by eq .",

    "equation  ( [ exp_noise ] ) gives the electrical noise when @xmath51 , it gives the mixed noise when either @xmath29 and @xmath52 , or vice versa , and it gives the heat noise when @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath31 is a real quantity when @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( auto - correlator ) , but can be complex otherwise ( cross - correlator ) .",
    "we have checked that the electrical noise @xmath35 extracted from eq .",

    "( [ exp_noise ] ) coincides with the existing results of the literature in the limit of energy independent transmission amplitude @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the mixed noises @xmath36 and @xmath56 are novels .",
    "this is the central result of this paper .",
    "it is valid at any frequency @xmath34 , coupling strength @xmath50 between the qd and the reservoirs , qd energy level @xmath6 , and for any temperature and voltage gradients between the left and right reservoirs .    in the following ,",
    "we choose first to restrict our study to the case where temperatures for the left and right reservoirs are equal , @xmath57 , and for @xmath58 , and we discuss the mixed noise spectrum in three situations : ( i ) at equilibrium , ( ii ) for energy independent transmission amplitude , and ( iii ) for an anderson - type transmission amplitude . in the latter case , we also discuss the spectral coherence in the presence of a temperature gradient between the two reservoirs .",
    "at equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the fermi energy for electrons in the reservoirs , and for equal left and right reservoir temperatures , i.e. , @xmath57 , we have from eqs .",

    ", we establish that the noises are related at equilibrium to the ac - conductances through the following fluctuation - dissipation relations @xmath70 through these relations , we can state that in a similar way that the finite - frequency electrical noise contains information on the dynamics of the charge transfer , the finite - frequency heat noise contains information on the dynamic of the heat transfer ( since @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the response to an excitation modulated in time ) .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ x ] ) confirms the key role played by the mixed noise @xmath73 to quantify the thermoelectric conversion .",
    "note that in the limit of zero - frequency , eqs .",
    "( [ g]-[k ] ) reduce to the relations given in ref .",
    ", since we have in that limit @xmath74 .      for an energy - independent transmission amplitude , @xmath75 ,",
    "the real parts of the electrical , mixed and heat noise spectra are given by fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] in the low temperature limit .",
    "we do not plot their imaginary parts whose magnitudes are smaller with a factor hundred comparing to the ones of the real parts .",
    "let us now discuss the features appearing on fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "first , we notice that similarly to the electrical noise , which cancels when the frequency is larger than the voltage , @xmath76 , the mixed and heat noises cancel as well .",
    "the reason is the following : knowing that the noise is called emission noise at positive frequency and absorption noise at negative frequency @xcite , we understand that the system can not emit an energy larger than the energy provided to it , here the voltage since temperature is taken small .",
    "second , we observe that the electrical noise varies linearly or by plateaus with both voltage and frequency , due to the fact that when transmission is energy independent , the system works in the linear regime .",
    "third , the mixed noise can change its sign whereas the electrical and heat noises keep a single sign .",
    "fourth , the electrical and mixed correlators between distinct reservoirs , @xmath77 , are equal in absolute values to the correlators in the same reservoir , @xmath78 , and nearly equal for the heat correlator @xcite .      in the limit of weak or perfect transmission , i.e. , @xmath85 or @xmath86 respectively , the integration over energy in eq .",
    "( [ exp_noise ] ) can be performed analytically ( see appendix  [ appendixb ] for the details of the calculation ) .",
    "the expressions of the noises , which are all real in these limits , are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "these expressions constitute a generalization of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to an out - of - equilibrium situation since the bose - einstein distribution function is estimated at frequency shifted by @xmath87 .",
    "concerning the electrical noise , its expression at @xmath85 is in full agreement with the result of perturbative calculations @xcite . concerning the mixed and heat noises expressions",
    ", there is no previous work to compare in the literature .",
    "note that at zero - voltage , the mixed noise cancels in both limits ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) but not in the intermediate regime : the mixed noise is then given by eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) which is a priori non - zero .",
    "it is also worth to notice that @xmath37 contains a contribution which is proportional to @xmath35 with a proportionality factor equal to @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the lorenz number . since in certain limits ,",
    "the heat noise is related to the thermal conductance and the electrical noise to the electrical conductance , as through eqs .",
    "( [ k ] ) and ( [ g ] ) at equilibrium for example , it is not surprising to find a relation which involves the lorenz number between the heat noise and the electrical noise thanks to the wiedemann - franz law , or between the thermal conductance and the electrical noise as obtained in ref .  .",
    "table  [ table1 ] gives also the sum over reservoirs of the electrical , mixed and heat noises , @xmath90 .",
    "contrary to the total electrical and mixed noises , which are equal to zero in the limits we consider ( no charging effect on the qd ) , the total heat noise takes a finite value which indeed corresponds to the heat power fluctuations . at zero - frequency , the power fluctuations is conserved , i.e. , the heat power fluctuations is equal to the electrical power fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is also true at finite - frequency provided that @xmath86 , since in that limit we have from table  [ table1 ] : @xmath91 . at zero - temperature ,",
    "we get for @xmath86 : @xmath92 , and for @xmath85 , @xmath93 at zero - voltage , and @xmath94 at zero - frequency in good agreement with ref .  .",
    ".expressions of the electrical , mixed and heat noises in the energy independent weak / perfect transmission limits @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath95 when @xmath96 , and vice versa .",

    "<S> using the keldysh green function technique , we calculate the finite - frequency correlator between the electrical current and the heat current flowing through a quantum dot connected to reservoirs . at equilibrium , we find that this quantity , called mixed noise , is linked to the thermoelectric ac - conductance by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . out - of - equilibrium , we discuss its spectrum and find evidence of the close relationship between the mixed noise and the thermopower . </S>",
    "<S> we study the spectral coherence and identify the conditions to have a strong correlation between the electrical and heat currents . the change in the spectral coherence due to the presence of a temperature gradient between the reservoirs </S>",
