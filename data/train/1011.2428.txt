    "these results suggest that there is also a broad range of unstable frequencies in the j2 regime but the frequency imposed by the pumping rate of the inner fluid selects the dominant one . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : syringepump ] , the transition from the j1 regime with no dominant frequency to the j2 regime , with extrinsic frequency selection , occurs at the flow rate where the frequency imposed by the syringe pump enters the range of unstable frequencies .",
    "these results are coherent with a convective nature of the flow instability in the second jetting regime .",
    "the frequency response of the system can be summarized from fig .  [",
    "fig : basestate](a ) . in the dripping regime",
    "there is only one , well defined frequency which is selected intrinsically , although not directly linked to the absolute frequency of refs .",
    "@xcite . in the jetting regime ,",
    "the zone of unstable frequencies is wider and with a less marked peak .",
    "the response of the j1 regime is typical of unselective noise amplification , with the whole range of unstable frequencies present in the spectrum , while the frequency selection in the j2 regime is extrinsic and is due to the frequency imposed by the syringe pump .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have given experimental evidence to confirm that the jetting regime in a confined co - flowing system is related to a convective instability of the inner thread .",
    "conversely , other mechanisms are likely involved in the dripping regime and determine the rate of drop formation .",
    "the frequency selection in this case could be influenced by a mechanism akin to the shear induced breakup described by umbanhowar et al .",
    "this would suggest that the influence of the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities of confined co - axial jets in this regime is less important than the local effect of shear at the nozzle , for our particular geometry .",
    "confirmation of the instability nature of the flow in the jetting regime is important to understand the mechanisms that control drop formation when capillary and viscous effects are in competition . in particular ,",
    "spatiotemporal stability analysis predicts high inherent dispersion in drop sizes in the jetting regime . this is because noise sources , such as micrometer sized fabrication defects of the channel walls or fluctuations in the pressure and flow rates , are unavoidably present .",
    "while this kind of perturbations are rapidly damped and usually negligible in microfluidics , they are exponentially amplified by a convectively unstable flow .",
    "understanding the flow nature provides a way to control this polydispersity by inducing the amplification of a preferred single frequency with a controlled forcing . here , we do so with periodic , localized laser heating , demonstrating the possibility of externally and dynamically tuning the frequency of drop formation and the drop size with low dispersion ."

    "<S> the dominant frequency of the jet oscillations as a function of the inner flow rate agrees qualitatively with the theoretical predictions in the jetting regime but not in the dripping regime . in the forced state , achieved with periodic laser heating , the dripping regime is found to be insensitive to the perturbation and the frequency of drop formation remains unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> the jetting regime , on the contrary , amplifies the externally imposed frequency , which translates into the formation of drops at the frequency imposed by the external forcing . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the dripping and jetting regimes are found to exhibit the main features of absolutely and convectively unstable flows respectively , but the frequency selection in the dripping regime is not ruled by the absolute frequency predicted by the stability analysis . </S>"
