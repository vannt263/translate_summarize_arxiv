    "the advent of the charge - coupled devices technology and , very recently , the availability of the refurbished _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) , coupled with the use of more and more sophisticated software for photometric analysis in crowded fields , have opened unique possibilities of using galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) as templates for testing the stellar evolution theories ( renzini and fusi pecci 1988rfp88 ) . in particular",
    ", the combined use of both colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and luminosity functions ( lfs ) derived from very accurate and complete photometric studies allows to reach levels of precision eventually suitable to check even the finer details predicted from updated theoretical models .    since the basic aim is to secure stellar samples _ as populous and complete as possible in any radial region _ of a cluster to yield statistically significant information on all the stellar evolutionary phases ( including the very short ones , @xmath10 yr ) and on the cluster as a whole ( f.i . taking into account also the cluster internal dynamics ) , proper ground - based observations in the outer areas",
    "must complement observations exploiting the photometry in the very central regions .    within this framework , we started a long - term project ( ground - based + ) to make m3 _ one of the first and best observed templates _ to verify in detail the model predictions ( buonanno 1986 , 1994 , rfp88 , ferraro 1993 , cacciari 1993 ) .",
    "why should m3 justify such a big effort ?",
    "there are many good reasons . among others , for instance : a ) since the early study by sandage ( 1953 ) , m3 is one of the proto - type pop ii clusters of intermediate - poor metallicity ; b ) it is rich of rr lyrae variables , and is usually adopted as oosterhoff ( 1939 ) class i prototype ; c ) it contains the first detected _ blue straggler stars _ ( bss ) , now suspected to have a bimodal radial distribution ( ferraro 1993 ) ; d ) its cmd displays a significant population in every branch , with an horizontal branch ( hb ) spanning a very wide range in color ( temperature ) , including extremely blue ( hot ) stars and post - asymptotic giant branch objects ( p - agb ) ; e ) it has been the target of recent spectroscopic studies ( including at high resolution , see for references carretta and gratton 1996a ) , yielding a new insight on its average metallicity and metallicity dispersion .",
    "the _ first _ step in our project has been a wide - field survey , based on the original sandage s photographic plates , of regions from 2 up to 7 arcminutes from the cluster center , whose results have already been published ( buonanno 1994ph94 ) . in that paper",
    "we published @xmath11,@xmath12 magnitudes for more than 10,000 stars , reaching about two magnitudes fainter than the main - sequence turnoff ( to ) , with internal photometric errors mostly smaller than 0.05 mag .",
    "as a _ second step _ , in this paper we present the results of a new bvi ccd - photometry for almost 10,000 additional stars measured in the inner parts of the cluster .",
    "third _ and final step to complete the survey will present the data secured on the cluster core ( proposal go 5496 , p.i .",
    "f. fusi pecci ) , whose reduction is currently in progress ( fusi pecci 1996 ) .",
    "a further paper specifically devoted to the bvi ccd - photometry of 65 rr lyrae variables is in preparation ( cacciari 1996 ) .    in section 2",
    ", we present the description of data acquisition and analysis , including tests for completeness and comparisons with our previous photographic results ( ph94 ) and with other data - sets . in section 3",
    ", we describe our results , with special emphasis on the features of the main bright branches of the cmd and , in particular , we deal with mean ridge lines , the so - called rgb - bump , star counts , population ratios , and an update of the overall blue stragglers population in m 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to conclusions and schematic summary .",
    "the ccd data were obtained at the 3.6 m cfht telescope on april 1991 by h. richer and r. buonanno within a wider collaborative program , using a 2,048 @xmath13 2,048 pixels detector with field of view of @xmath2 7 @xmath13 7. the observations consisted of two sets of bvi frames reported in table  [ t : obslog ] .",
    "the short exposures were specifically taken to survey the very inner regions , avoiding strong saturation effects . since the detector had a very poor response in the blue , ferraro ( 1993f93 )",
    "used the deepest @xmath12 and @xmath14 exposures to get a first hint on the bss population in the cluster central regions ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "the individual stars measured on the plates in the ph94 bright ( _ crosses _ ) and faint ( _ small dots _ ) sample are respectively plotted .    to give a global overview of the planned survey",
    ", we report in figure  [ f : f2 ] also the size and location of the three wfpc2 fields we observed with go 5496 .",
    "as it can be seen , there is a useful overlapping between the photographic , ccd , and considered areas . for comparison , we have also reported in the same figure ( _ dashed squares _ ) the fields covered by other recent photometric studies on m 3 , namely those by bolte ( 1995 ; hereinafter bhs ) , guhathakurta ( 1994 ; hereinafter gybs ) , and burgarella ( 1995 ) using the wfpc of before refurbishment .",
    "the data analysis was performed in bologna and rome using romafot ( buonanno 1979 , 1983 ) , whose standard procedures have been reported in other papers ( see for references ferraro 1990 , f93 ) .",
    "no special requirement has been involved either in the searching phase or in measuring the instrumental magnitudes .",
    "since the only wide set of standard stars available in the m3 field we observed were those measured with the photoelectric photometer by sandage ( 1953 , 1970 ) , later revised by sandage and katem ( 1982 ) , we put some effort to obtain an independent ccd - calibration .",
    "as a matter of fact , neither bhs ( they only presented instrumental magnitudes ) nor gybs ( who ultimately referred their magnitudes to auriere and cordoni 1983 and f93 ) obtained an independent calibration .",
    "the photometry of auriere and cordoni ( 1983 ) in the central regions was linked to star profiles ( king 1966 ) and can not be used for calibration .",
    "the data presented by scholz and kharchenko ( 1994 ) are referred to sandage ( 1970 ) .",
    "finally , paez ( 1990 ) in their ccd - study of the outer regions ( at about 5 arcmin from the cluster center ) did not get any independent calibration but referred their data to 41 stars in common with sandage and katem ( 1982 ) .    in ph94",
    ", we used the sequence of photoelectric standards from sandage ( 1970 ) to calibrate the photographic magnitudes to the standard @xmath16 johnson system . in f93",
    ", the cfht data were calibrated using two standard fields observed during the same nights in ngc 4147 and m 67 , with the well known problems related to the difficult handling of calibrated stars in crowded standard fields .",
    "eventually , we concluded that a new independent ccd - calibration was necessary starting from a proper set of primary standards .",
    "after several unfruitful runs ( due to bad weather , telescope failures etc . )",
    ", our new calibration is based on an observing run carried out at the 1.23 m telescope at the german - spanish astronomical centre , calar alto , spain .",
    "bvi ccd - frames of m 3 and of several landolt ccd standard areas were acquired under photometric conditions in the night of april 2 , 1995 , using a thinned 1024 @xmath13 1024",
    "tektronix chip ( 24 @xmath17 pixels , 0.50 arcsec / pixel ) , with ar - coatings .",
    "the @xmath14 filter is in the kron - cousin system , centered at 8020   .",
    "the calibration of the cfht ccd magnitudes was thus performed in two steps .",
    "first , we used 18 stars in 7 ccd standard areas ( landolt 1983 ) to link the calar alto instrumental magnitudes to the standard johnson system .",
    "the final equations we adopted for the b , v , and i filters are reported below and plotted in figure  [ f : f3 ] : @xmath18 ( @xmath190.029 ) ,    @xmath20    ( @xmath190.020 ) ,    @xmath21    ( @xmath190.026 ) ,    where b , v , i , are the instrumental magnitudes",
    ". will indicate the standard deviation of a single measurement , while the value after the symbol @xmath7 will refer to the standard deviation of the mean . ] the atmospheric extinction terms in each colour have been derived by observing the same standard field at different airmass during the night .    in the @xmath14 calibration",
    "we have used only the measurements having a sufficient s / n . in particular , this has led to exclude two of the bluest standard . because of this , we could exclude the existence of residual colour terms for the @xmath14 band .",
    "these equations have been used to calibrate the instrumental magnitude of a sample of @xmath2 100 isolated , unsaturated stars in the calar alto frames for which the aperture photometry has been performed .",
    "this set of stars has been used to correct the cfht magnitudes ( previously calibrated with the ngc 4147 and m 67 standard fields , see f93 ) .",
    "the relations linking the  old \" cfht calibration system to the new standard system ( ccd96 ) are :    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    following the above procedure we linked the whole cfht - ccd data set to the johnson system . in the next section we find the relation to transform the photographic data set to the new standard system here adopted .    in this respect",
    ", it is important to note that , after completion of our reductions , we became aware of the existence of a new independent photometric study of a very wide sample of m3 stars ( about 23,700 ) carried out by k.a .",
    "montgomery ( 1995  m95 ) as part of his ph.d .",
    "dissertation , based on 2048@xmath132048 ( t2ka ) ccd - frames taken with the 0.9-meter telescope at kpno . since with the f/7.5 secondary , the telescope produced an image scale of 0.68 arcsecs / px and a field of view of 23.2 arcminutes , and moreover 2@xmath132 mosaics of images were made with the centers offset by 10 arcminutes in both right ascension and declination , the total field covered by montgomery fully overlaps both our field and the outer field independently observed by stetson and harris ( 1988 ) , which being located outside the region we observed could not be used in our photometry .",
    "we will discuss in detail the results of the comparisons with this new data - set at sect .",
    "2.4 and 2.5 .",
    "more than 900 stars have been found in common between the ccd96 and ph94 ( bright and faint ) sample",
    ". however , due to the limited performances of the used ccd detector in the blue band , the photometric internal errors in the @xmath11 band are large and reduce the reliability of the transformations .",
    "for this reason only 532 bright ( @xmath26 ) stars in common have been used to derive the relations linking the photographic photometric system to the standard system here adopted .",
    "the final relations correcting the @xmath12 magnitude and the @xmath27 colours are :    @xmath28    @xmath29    these corrections have been applied to the whole ( bright + faint ) ph94 sample . a small residual non - linearity in the photographic data ( probably due to the original plate transformation ) has been corrected using a polynomial fit of 5@xmath30 order ( to yield @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the @xmath12 and @xmath11 filter , respectively ) .",
    "this additional correction is properly determined only for bright stars ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "resting on our own data alone , it would be impossible to check properly the linearity of the fainter ph94 measures .",
    "however , by comparing our data with the quite similar data - set obtained by m95 , we can extend the linearity test to fainter magnitudes , as explained in sect .",
    "2.4 . from this last comparison",
    "we have obtained further ( small ) corrections for the fainter stars ( see sect .",
    "2.4 ) using a similar procedure as adopted for the bright sample .",
    "then , to avoid any discontinuity at the junction between the bright and the faint ph94 samples , we have imposed coincidence between the corrections computed at the junction [ @xmath35 and @xmath36 from the two different ccd data - sets .",
    "fortunately , they actually turned out to be almost equal , and this reinforces both the validity of the procedure and the achievement of a good linearity allover the `` revised '' ph94 sample .    in figure",
    "[ f : f4 ] and figure  [ f : f5 ] , we present the ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) cmds containing only stars outside a radius of 20 \" from the cluster centre , excluding the variables which are however included in the lists . due to the low efficiency in the blue of the cfht ccd - camera we have plotted in figure  [",
    "f : f4 ] only the objects measured on our b ccd images with @xmath26 . in particular , the upper part of the @xmath37 cmd ( brighter than @xmath39 ) contains 2227 constant and 154 variable stars taken from the cfht ccd sample , plus 42 variable stars and 444 constant stars taken from the _ bright _ photographic sample outside the ccd field . for magnitudes fainter than @xmath39",
    ", we report the 9339 stars from the _ faint _ ph94 sample .",
    "the total number of stars in this cmd is therefore 12206 .",
    "the @xmath40 colour magnitude diagram contains 9647 stars including 155 variables that have both @xmath12 and @xmath14 magnitudes .",
    "all the available data ( magnitudes and positions ) are available upon request from the authors , and will also be sent to strasbourg data center . as in the ph94 paper , x ,",

    "coordinate transformation to other systems can be easily performed ; to help with cross - identification , we note that our bright stars no .",
    "8877 , 10052 and 12045 are the stars no . 9 , 3842 and 2267 , respectively , in the photometric catalogue of gybs .",
    "this allows conversion of our positions to equinox 2000 coordinates , since gybs s positions are in r.a . and dec",
    ". referred to the equinox 2000 .",
    "we compare here our ccd - calibrated photometry with the data taken from other studies for the stars in common .",
    "@xmath43 _ comparison with sandage and katem 1982 _    the comparison was made using 81 stars from tables i and ii of sk82 , cross- identified with our data .",
    "the results of this comparison , together with the least squares fits through the data , are shown in figure  [ f : f6 ] .",
    "as one can see , the overall agreement is good , but there are also important differences .",
    "first , there is a luminosity shift in both b and v , variable with varying the b - v colour .",
    "second , there is a quite noticeable colour term , in the sense that our data are @xmath2 0.08 mag redder at @xmath44 ( the bluest point of the hb ) , @xmath2 0.03 mag redder at @xmath45 ( corresponding to the middle of the instability strip ) , and @xmath2 0.08 mag @xmath46 at @xmath47 , @xmath48 at the termination of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "@xmath43 _ comparison with guhathakurta 1995 _    figure  [ f : f7 ] shows the results of a similar comparison with the @xmath12 and @xmath14 magnitudes of gybs for 634 stars , almost down to the completeness limit of the survey .",
    "gybs studied the central field of m 3 using the f555w and f785lp bands of the _ hst / planetary camera-1 _ , that are similar to the johnson @xmath12 and @xmath14 bandpasses , respectively .",
    "as explained below , this comparison is actually more useful for checking completeness since , after a first colour transformation from @xmath49 instrumental magnitudes , gybs linked their photometry to the available ground - based data .",
    "in particular , their final values include the application of zero - point offsets to the @xmath12 and @xmath14 data to match fiducial points of the upper parts of the cmds presented by auriere and cordoni ( 1983 ) and @xmath50 .",
    "the generally good agreement shown figure  [ f : f7 ] is thus obvious though the f93 ccd calibration was still based on the ngc 4147 and m67 standard areas .",
    "@xmath43 _ comparison with montgomery 1995 , and stetson and harris 1988 _    concerning the data - set obtained by m95 , we present here the results of the comparisons made using the still preliminary list of magnitudes and colors kindly made available to us by dr .",
    "since they could still be subject to further analysis and revisions , and will be eventually published in the near future ( janes and montgomery , 1996 ) , we schematically report on two main aspects which are of interest for the present study : the linearity test and the comparison of the zero - points .",
    "concerning the linearity test , after carrying out several different procedures , we decided to restrict the sample to a sub - set of the 7,152 stars in common ( from the rgb tip down to the faintest magnitude limit ) , which have unambiguous identifications , no detected companions in both photometries , and sufficiently low and well difined background .",
    "this implies that these stars lie mostly in the outer cluster regions and have good internal photometry in both studies .",
    "from the study of the residuals it is confirmed that , while no significant trend is evident after the corrections applied to the bright ph94 stars using our corresponding ccd data ( see sect . 2.3 ) , there is still a small residual non - linearity in the faint photographic ph94 data , quite similar in size and morphology to that detected for the bright stars with respect to our ccd measures .",
    "therefore , we have corrected the faint ph94 measures using again a polynomial fit of 5@xmath30 order ( computed over @xmath2 3,800 faint stars ) as done for the bright stars , and imposing coincidence of the ( small , @xmath20.01 - 0.02 mag ) linearity corrections at the junction between the bright and faint samples ( see sect .",
    "the comparison of the zero - points has also been made on a special sub - set of about 2,000 stars , chosen within the sample considered for the linearity test but with v@xmath51 ( to avoid low s / n data ) .",
    "the final figures for the differences , in the sense _ m95 ",
    "ours _ , are : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 mag , respectively . as can be seen , especially for the b - magnitudes , the residuals are quite large and somewhat worrying .    based on the description reported in table 2.1 and fig .",
    "2.3 of his thesis , montgomery observed standard star fields from landolt ( 1992 ) over the six night run at kpno , securing approximately 250 measurements with internal accuracy in the individual measure better than 0.05 mag .",
    "the kpno run standard deviations of the residuals he quoted were 0.018 in v and 0.024 mag in b , quite comparable with the figures from our own calibration ( see eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) ) .",
    "it is therefore difficult to explain the differences between the zero - points adopted in the two photometries based just on the formal errors . and",
    "it is also difficult to choose which of the two may be correct . to have further insight on this important aspect ,",
    "we have carried out a further comparison with the data obtained by stetson and harris ( 1988 , sh88 ) .",
    "since there is no overlap between our surveyed regions and the area observed by sh88 , we must use the comparisons ( for different sets of stars ) between m95 and sh88 on the one hand , and m95 and this study , on the other , to provide a link between sh88 and our photometry .",
    "so doing , we get that the differences between our data and sh88 ( in the sense _ ours  sh88",
    "_ ) are : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 mag .",
    "these figures are compatible with the residuals measured by montgomery with respect to sh88 . from fig . 2.13 and table 2.3 of montgomery ( 1995 ) one has in fact for the residuals _",
    "m95  sh88 _",
    "@xmath58 , @xmath59 mag , based on 27 stars in common with sh88 . as a matter of fact , the zero - points of sh88 turn out to be intermediate between the other two photometric calibrations .",
    "since we have only two frames in each colour with quite different exposure times , we can not use repeated measures of the same star to yield a direct estimate of the _ internal _ measuring errors .",
    "however , we can get some quantitative hints from the photometric parameters listed for each star within romafot ( which essentially trace the quality of the fit ) and from the comparison of the morphology of the individual branches in the cmd ( at different magnitude levels ) with those obtained in previous studies . in particular",
    ", using also as reference the error estimates discussed in ph94 , we are fairly confident that the _ internal _ errors in the present photometry are @xmath20.020.03 mag at @xmath60 , and @xmath20.05 at the to region .    concerning the _ systematic _ errors , we have already discussed the problems related to the zero - points and the colour transformations .",
    "there are now three independent calibrations referred to observations of landolt s ( 1992 ) standards .",
    "they are in marginal agreement , but it is difficult at the present stage to choose which is the best .",
    "since the calibration here adopted seems to be compatible with that obtained by stetson and harris ( 1988 ) ( they actually show a systematic difference of 0.04 both in b and v , yielding however no colour difference ) , we decided to keep using our calibration .    to be conservative and taking into account the size of the uncertainties ,",
    "we conclude however that we still can not exclude errors as high as 0.05 mag in the _ absolute _ values , both in magnitude and in colour ( particularly at the blue and red extremes ) .",
    "such a conclusion is quite disappointing in particular for what concerns the specific study of the rr lyrae variables ( cacciari 1996 ) , and further efforts to improve the absolute calibrations are urged .      besides the comparisons in colour and magnitude discussed above ,",
    "the bhs , gybs , and m95 samples can be also used to test in a quantitative way the degree of completeness actually achieved in the present photometric data set .",
    "these checks can be performed on different subsets , depending on the regions and the magnitude range covered in the different studies .",
    "@xmath43 _ comparison with bolte 1993 _    of particular interest is the comparison with the bhs s samples , since they were obtained with the same cfht telescope , `` under apparently photometric conditions and with excellent seeing '' .",
    "a careful check is feasible using all stars brighter than @xmath61 16.75 , the limit in @xmath12 used by bhs for the reference population in order to study the blue stragglers distribution ( see below ) .",
    "the result of this check is plotted in figure  [ f : f8 ] that compares the ( @xmath12 , @xmath62 ) cmd we have obtained from surveying the same area as bhs ( see figure  [ f : f2 ] ) with their ( @xmath12 , @xmath63 ) diagram .",
    "note that their instrumental @xmath12 magnitudes have been transformed to our system by using the brightest ( 12.5 @xmath64 17.0 ) 544 stars in common .",
    "in the region in common between the two samples , bhs have found 801 stars while we detected 831 objects , at @xmath65 . among these ,",
    "775 stars were successfully cross - identified , whereas 26 stars from bhs and 53 stars from our survey had no mutual correspondence .",
    "however , we must note that most of these residual stars lie on the faint rgb , just above the threshold ( @xmath66 ) adopted to carry out the comparison .",
    "therefore , the difference in the samples essentially depends on small variations in the arbitrary offset necessary to match the two data - sets in @xmath12 and on photometric errors . since the stars plotted in the cmd of figure  [ f : f8 ] are the same and the observing conditions of the bhs run were excellent , the overall appearance of the two cmds confirms also the good _ internal _ quality of our photometry .",
    "note that the width of the red hb ( in particular ) is due to the inclusion of randomly phased measures of the variable stars .",
    "@xmath43 _ comparison with guhathakurta 1995 _    a similar check has been carried out with the gybs data .",
    "figure  [ f : f9 ] presents the cmds for the stars independently detected and measured in the common area covered by the two studies ( see figure  [ f : f2 ] , @xmath67 1 ) . in this region ,",
    "we have found 340 stars while gybs list 339 objects . of them ,",
    "15 and 16 stars in the gybs and in our subsamples , respectively , do not have cross - identification . as for bhs , they mostly lie near the faint limit of the selected subsets , and the difference is thus due to the selection bias induced by the photometric scatter .    by inspecting figure  [ f : f9 ] ,",
    "it is also interesting to note the difference in photometric quality achieved in the two samples .",
    "since the gybs data have been obtained using the @xmath49 wfpc1 , the larger internal scatter is most likely due to the difficulty of measuring `` aberrated '' stars in the inner crowded region . on the other hand ,",
    "the excellent agreement in the total numbers of selected objects confirms the very high degree of completeness achieved in our ground - based survey ( note that the searching phase is almost `` perfect '' for the bright objects also with @xmath49 wfpc1 ) .",
    "the comparisons discussed above can be considered as _ external _ independent checks of the degree of completeness actually achieved in our searching phase , at least as far as the upper part of the cmd is concerned .",
    "the results of the comparison have shown that completeness is close to @xmath68 even using the @xmath49 sample as reference . since this comparison refers to the innermost regions of the cluster , where completeness is most problematic , we are confident that a similar very high degree of efficiency has been guaranteed by our searching routine in the more external fields .",
    "additional tests made adopting the usual `` artificial star '' procedure fully confirm this conclusion .",
    "@xmath43 _ comparison with montgomery , 1995 : the bright sample _",
    "the availability of the new catalog compiled by montgomery ( 1995 ) has offered the opportunity to carry out a preliminary check of completeness allover our observed field as his observations fully overlap our considered regions .",
    "since the limiting magnitudes of the two surveys vary with the cluster regions , we have separated the analysis of the bright sample from that of the faint one .",
    "figure  [ f : f9a ] shows the cmds obtained from the two photometries down to b@xmath69 , considering just the overlapping area . as can be seen , apart from a slightly larger scatter in m95 data , the overall morphology is very similar and also the total number of stars is comparable .",
    "this evidence by itself confirms that the degree of completeness achieved in the two studies is also similar and high .",
    "we have detected 2841 stars while m95 lists 2750 objects .",
    "however , to have quantitative hints of the completeness of our sample it is useful to check the number and properties of the objects which are present only in the m95 sample , as they could have been missed in our search .",
    "figure  [ f : f9bis ] shows the cmd ( _ panel a _ ) and the map ( _ panel b _ ) of the objects m95 detected on our field and we apparently missed .",
    "it is quite evident that they are mostly located in the very central regions where the resolving capability of the two surveys is different , our own being much better .",
    "a careful interactive analysis of a subset of these objects has shown that most of them are actually blended images which we resolved into two ( or more ) separated stars with off - center positions with respect to the blend . if we increase the size of the box ( from 0.5 to 1.0 arcseconds ) we get multiple identifications with the individual components .",
    "the few bright stars located at the outskirts of the considered field are lacking in our samples as they are `` field '' stars according to cudworth ( 1979 ) or because they are highly saturated standards .    to summarize the comparisons and to give a further insight on the mutual completeness of the four considered samples , we have plotted in figure  [ f : f10new ] the ratios between the number of stars measured by bhs ( _ panel a _ ) , gybs ( _ panel b _ ) , and m95 ( _ panel c _ ) , respectively , and the number of stars we measured per bin of 0.5 mag in @xmath12 .",
    "the comparison is obviously made on the areas in common between each quoted study and our own survey .",

    "the bright samples are substantially the same especially considering the effect of binning over cmds which have slightly different calibrations and local morphologies .",
    "in conclusion , based on the tests here carried out and on those already reported for the outer samples considered in ph94 , we can say that most likely all the objects brighter than @xmath66 have now been detected and measured in a circular annulus with 0.3 @xmath70 7 in m3 .",

    "_    the considerations made above are sufficient to assess the degree of completeness necessary in determining the populations of the bright rgb and agb ( down to @xmath71 mag below the hb ) .",
    "however , further discussion is required concerning the completeness of the faint , blue hb tail which plays a rle in the computation of the various population ratios we are going to discuss later .",
    "since we have specifically taken deep uv exposures with @xmath49 to study this aspect and a detailed paper is in preparation , we simply anticipate here the essence of the results .",
    "the preliminary reductions of the @xmath49 data confirm that their is no significant population in the hb blue tail fainter than @xmath72 ( for @xmath73 ) except for the objects we have detected with the present bvi ccd - survey and the old ph94 study .    in particular , in the area in common between the present sample and the @xmath49 survey , we have detected 8 objects in the ccd frames lying at @xmath74 , @xmath75 and 8 objects in the @xmath49 frames .",
    "although the detected population is small and the membership to the hb blue tail is somewhat uncertain given the photometric scatter , this ensures that the loss of candidate faint hb stars should be small and in any case quite negligible in the computation of the global population ratios ( see sect .",
    "outside @xmath76 , where hst - data are not availabe at present , we rest on the tests for completeness carried out on the photographic plates used in ph94 . on the other hand , with decreasing significantly the degree of crowding",
    ", the degree of completeness raises quite steeply .    in conclusion , from the available data there is no evidence that the stellar counts of the hb ( down to @xmath39 , with @xmath74 ) and the agb and rgb ( down to @xmath66 ) are affected at any significant level from incompleteness .",

    "the degree of completeness of that sample was checked using various techniques , but it was impossible at that time to make any comparison with similar observations in the same field .",
    "we have now the opportunity to directly compare our data with the m95 sample over the same annulus and get some useful information .",
    "figure  [ f : f9b ] presents the cmds for the objects measured in the two surveys in the considered annulus . as already noticed for the bright samples , they are very similar and consistent . of course",
    ", the total numbers of measured objects are different mostly because the limiting magnitude we reached is deeper .    to make a quantitative comparison it is therefore useful to compute the population ratios over magnitude bins large enough to avoid small number fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ f : f10a ] shows the distribution of the observed ratios as a function of the v magnitudes .",

    "since the lower part of the @xmath12 , @xmath27 colour - magnitude diagram ( composed only by re - calibrated photographic data ) was discussed at length in ph94 , we will concentrate here exclusively on the bright part of these cmds .",
    "the main aspects worth of note are the following :    1 .",
    "the main branches can easily be delineated in any radial bin , including the most internal region . in particular",
    ", the rgb and the agb can be separated quite easily at the agb base , located at @xmath78 .",
    "the giant branch can easily be traced up to the tip , which is located at @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( star @xmath81 4191 ) .",
    "the rgb - bump is also clearly detectable as a clump of stars at @xmath82 ( see below ) .",
    "2 .   despite the increased scatter in the ccd sample due to",
    "crowding in the inner regions ( and to the bright plate limit in the b cfht - exposures just above @xmath39 ) , the matching of the different samples is adequately smooth .",
    "the bulk of stars located just above the to - region within the colour range @xmath83 are most probably the result of _ optical blending _ of two bright ms - stars of similar colour yielding a blend approximately 0.75 mag brighter than the individual components .",
    "this conjecture is further supported by their progressive disappearance with distance from the crowded central regions .",
    "the difficulty of properly separating these objects represents a crucial problem in the study of the luminosity function of the sgb .",
    "as already discussed for instance by ferraro ( 1992a , b ) , some of these stars may also be blends of sgb objects and blue stragglers .",
    "the hb is narrow and , over the considered region ( @xmath84 ) , it contains 186 variable stars , which have not been plotted in figure  [ f : radbv ] and figure  [ f : radvi ] .",
    "the blue hb tail extends down to @xmath85 , about half a magnitude brighter than the to - level , and there is little doubt that this extremely blue hb population is quite clearly detached from the bulk of the other hb stars by a discontinuity in the population at @xmath8616.816.9 ( see also section 3.3 in ph94 ) .",
    "there are also a few stars about half a magnitude brighter than the average luminosity of the hb , @xmath87 , and located within 2 from the cluster center .",
    "while the possibility of field interlopers seems quite improbable given the high galactic latitude of the cluster , their presence could be due to `` optical blending '' between hb and rgb components or to the existence of a more evolved ( @xmath88hb ) population .",
    "4 .   several candidate blue stragglers have been detected and discussed in f93 .",
    "their distribution is better seen in the @xmath12 , @xmath62 cmds , where they trace , as expected , a continuation of the main sequence .",

    "the higher value ( @xmath99 ) is based on direct spectroscopic determinations of [ fe / h ] from individual stars , as opposed to the integrated indexes used by zinn and collaborators . the latest high resolution spectroscopic investigations , namely sneden _",
    "( 1992 ; skpl ) and carretta and gratton ( 1996a ; cg96 ) , show that the problem of the reliable measure of the metal abundance of this template cluster is not trivial at all .",
    "in fact , skpl found @xmath112 from the analysis of 7 stars ( and a slight different value of -1.42 by adding 3 other stars , see kraft 1995 ) , and cg96 derived @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) from 10 stars .",
    "both studies are based on high resolution , high signal - to - noise ccd echelle spectra of high quality . in particular cg96",
    "have re - analysed the equivalent widths published by skpl for m 3 and other clusters to obtain a new , homogeneous metallicity scale for 24 calibrating clusters .",
    "the main differences between the two quoted studies ( apart from minor changes in the adopted values for the microturbulent velocity ) are in the set of adopted atomic parameters ( in particular oscillator strengths @xmath115 for fe  i and fe  ii ) and in the choice of the model atmospheres used in the analysis .",
    "cg96 used the latest , updated models from the grid of kurucz ( 1992 ) , that allow an homogeneous comparison between solar and stellar abundances , alleviating a major drawback of any former analysis of abundances for globular cluster stars .",
    "in fact , as discussed by cg96 , all previous spectroscopic determinations of the [ fe / h ] content of globular cluster stars were actually systematically uncertain because of the large differences ( @xmath116  dex ) still existing in the reference solar value adopted in the absolute analyses .",
    "in particular , a significant discrepancy persists in the solar fe abundances as obtained using the holweger and mller ( 1974hm ) semi - empirical solar model ( usually considered to be the best reproduction of the solar atmosphere ) and the model atmospheres proposed by bell ( 1976 ) , generally adopted ( also in the skpl papers ) in the analysis of cool cluster giants ( see also leep et al .",
    "the crucial problem thus is to find a firm answer to the question : _ what is the correct solar abundance to adopt as reference for fe?_.    the recent analysis by cg96 has apparently settled the discrepancy as they have obtained a revised determination of the solar fe abundance which is very similar to the value given by the hm model .",
    "this result has been obtained by using the set of @xmath115 values discussed in cg96 and a solar model extracted from the same grid of kurucz ( 1992 ) models as used for the analysis of the cluster giants .",
    "consequently , the study of cg96 yields a systematic difference , @xmath117 @xmath118 ( @xmath119=0.08 over 162 stars analyzed ; 0.08 in the case of m 3 ) with respect to previous analyses , which used the bell ( 1976 ) models that are @xmath120  k cooler than hm in the line formation region .",
    "therefore , even if the observational material ( @xmath48 the equivalent widths ) is the same , the analysis of cg96 seems to be more self - consistent than that of skpl .    since the precise determination of the metallicity of m 3 has important implications on various items ( f.i . on the long - standing problem of the so - called sandage period shift effect , see sandage 1993 ) , it may be useful to analyse further the discrepancy between the value @xmath111 obtained via the zinn and west ( 1984 ) calibration and the significantly higher @xmath121 obtained from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "zinn and west ( 1984 ) based their estimates on integrated cluster features ultimately calibrated using old ( and sometimes uncertain ) abundances obtained from photographic high - dispersion spectra ( cohen 1983 ) .",
    "however , from more than 160 giants homogeneously analyzed in 24 calibrating clusters , cg96 have demonstrated that the zw metallicities differ significantly from these new results . in particular , they are about 0.10  dex higher for [ fe / h]@xmath122 , 0.23  dex lower for @xmath123[fe / h]@xmath124 , and 0.11  dex too high for [ fe / h]@xmath124 .",
    "this non - linearity of the zw scale is significant at 3@xmath119 level and can not be ignored when discussing astrophysical problems involving tiny metallicity differences among the clusters .    on the basis of the cg96 new scale , carretta and gratton ( 1996b )",
    "have also derived a new calibration of  in terms of . using the values of  from the compilation of michel and smith ( 1984 ) for 22 calibrating cluster on the new scale",
    ", they obtained a @xmath125order polynomial fit that closely resembles the theoretical calibration of demarque ( 1982 ) from evolutionary red - giant models .",
    "based on this new calibration , the metallicity of m 3 turns out to be @xmath126 , with a 1@xmath119 error bar of 0.18  dex , in good agreement with the spectroscopic determination reported by cg96 .",
    "in conclusion , from the detailed re - analysis discussed above , we are inclined to believe that the metallicity of m 3 is slightly larger than estimated so far and probably the best value to adopt at present is @xmath127 , where both the absolute figure and the size of the error are just the result of our global overview .",
    "theoretical evolutionary models predict the existence of a special feature along the rgb called the `` rgb - bump '' ( see e.g. thomas 1967 , iben 1968 , rfp88 ) . as discussed in detail among others by rood and crocker ( 1985 ) , the practical detection of such a feature requires the availability of very populous rgb samples .",
    "fusi pecci ( 1990 ) detected the rgb - bump in 11 globular clusters , including m 3 ( based on our early ph94 data ; see also ferraro 1992 ) .",
    "the use of our new data - base allows us to confirm the detection of the rgb - bump ( see figure  [ f : f4 ] , figure  [ f : bumptot ] ) located at @xmath128=15.45@xmath70.05 , i.e. exactly the same value as the previous measurement listed in table 4 of fusi pecci ( 1990 ) , and we thus refer to that paper for the discussion of this specific issue .      based on our bright sample , containing @xmath129 the stars brighter than @xmath39 and located within a square of about 7@xmath13 7 ( but with @xmath130 ) , the hb of m 3 spans a very wide colour range ( @xmath71 mag ) , from the red end at @xmath1310.7 to the bluest stars at @xmath132 . therefore the distribution in effective temperature",
    "is very wide , and , in turn , there is a wide spread in the hb mass distribution ( rood and crocker 1985 ) .",

    "in particular , the hb of m 3 has been _ dissected _ into sub - groups having presumably different evolutionary histories .",
    "the basic idea is that both the blue and the red extremes of the observed hb might include peculiar objects which are intrinsically different from _ genuine _ hb stars and are rather the result of the stellar and dynamical evolution of binary systems ( at least in part related to the blue stragglers ) , or are hb objects which keep track of interactions causing an `` extra - mass loss '' from the envelope during the previous evolutionary stages .    for the sake of brevity we refer to the quoted papers for a complete discussion and simply re - analyse the content of the boxes which have been defined in ph94 to describe the hb morphology .    as show in figure  [",

    ". their location in the cmd could well be due to large photometric errors or they could be non - members .",
    "most of them are confined within the inner 2 arcmin from the cluster center .",
    "if their photometry and membership are confirmed , they could represent good candidates to search for the possible descendants of late collisional mergers ( bailyn and iben 1989 , fusi pecci 1992 ) or they could be post - hb stars ( such as agb - manqu , see e.g. greggio and renzini 1990 , cacciari 1995 , dcruz 1996 ) .",
    "group eb _ : 10 stars ( 4 in ph94 ) .",
    "together with the 10 heb stars , this group constitutes a subset of 20 stars clearly segregated from the bulk of the hb stellar population .",
    "their total number and location seems sufficient to exclude the possibility that all of them are interlopers .",
    "hence , we are inclined to conclude that there is now clear - cut observational evidence for the existence of a very extended ( though sparsely populated ) blue hb tail in m 3 , possibly separated by a gap from the bulk of the _ normal _ hb objects .",

    "group b _ : 206 objects , ( 70 in ph94 ) .",
    "the population of this box includes presumably _ normal _ hb stars located above a small ( apparent ? ) gap at @xmath135 and bluer than the blue edge of the instability strip .",
    "the scatter of the points around the mean ridge line is compatible with the size of the observational errors ( note that the b exposures are short ) , but it could also partially reflect the effects due to evolution off the zahb for some stars .",

    "for the other 100 hb variables mean magnitudes and colours are not available from the present photometric data .",
    "consequently , their presence in the plotted cmd would introduce a `` confusing '' scatter of the points both in magnitude and in colour mostly due to a random - phase effect of the available measurements , which are insufficient to cover completely the light curve .",
    "+ a few of these stars could however also be evolved hb stars brighter than the zahb .",
    "finally , there are 17 constant stars which are located within the box because of photometric errors or due to the existence of some overlapping in colour of the variable and non - variable strips .",
    "this specific item will be dealt with in more details in a forthcoming paper .",
    "however , we have included them in the total number of hb stars .",

    "in turn , this allows one to get a deeper insight on unsolved problems like for instance the extent of the mixing phenomena , or to measure important basic quantities like the primordial helium abundance y ( see rfp88 ) .",
    "the approach to the problem is well established ( see e.g. rfp88 , ph94 ) : from the cmd one can measure a set of parameters to be used along with the appropriate calibrations based on theoretical models .",
    "the most frequently used are :    * @xmath137 , the ratio of the numbers of stars on the hb and on the rgb brighter than zahb luminosity at log@xmath138 ; * @xmath139 , which includes also the number of stars in the agb phase ; * @xmath140 ; * @xmath141 .    to preserve full homogeneity with the study of buzzoni ( 1983 , bfbc ) which is still the standard reference for this subject",
    ", we have adopted their prescriptions . in particular",
    ", we fixed the separation between hb and agb at @xmath142 , about 0.8 mag above the mean magnitude of the hb , and counted rgb stars brighter than @xmath143 , adopting a differential bolometric correction @xmath117b.c.=0.11 mag ( o. straniero , private communication ) between hb and rgb stars .",
    "the results for the star counts along the various branches and the derived parameters are listed in table  [ t : ratios ] .",
    "ll + n@xmath144 & @xmath145 414 + n@xmath146 & @xmath145 550 + n@xmath147 & @xmath145 69 + @xmath148 & @xmath145 1.33 @xmath7 0.12 + @xmath149 & @xmath145 1.14 @xmath7 0.10 + @xmath150 & @xmath145 0.17 @xmath7 0.03 + @xmath151 & @xmath145 0.12 @xmath7 0.02 +   +     + note : all counts and ratios refer to our bright complete sample ( bcs ) .",
    "[ t : ratios ]    the parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 essentially indicate the relative ratios of the lifetimes of the agb , rgb , and hb .",
    "since these lifetimes are basically driven by nuclear burning and mixing phenomena ( which may alter the `` local '' fuel quantity ) , different ratios are predicted from the models with varying mechanisms and extension of mixing for fixed properties of the nuclear burning . within the framework discussed by rfp88",
    ", the values here obtained for @xmath150 and @xmath151 are fully compatible with the predictions of `` standard and canonical '' models .",
    "the values for @xmath148 and @xmath149 can be used along with eqs .",
    "11 and 13 of bfbc to obtain an estimate of the primordial he abundance based on their calibrations of these parameters in terms of y. from the values listed in table  [ t : ratios ] ( the errors are just from count statistics ) , we obtain y@xmath152 and y@xmath153 , in excellent agreement with the mean value found by bfbc as well as with other estimates ( see e.g. boesgaard and steigman 1985 , olive and steigman 1995 and ref . therein ) . in the computation we have considered for the hb all the stars included in the samples er+r+v+r+eb+heb .",
    "this may not be fully correct if at least some of them are _ non - genuine _ hb stars ( in the sense that they are not evolving `` directly '' from the rgb ) .",
    "however , since their number ( including the few shb stars ) is so small , the result is practically unaffected taking into account the size of the errors .",
    "for instance , by deleting from the hb all the stars in the samples er+eb+heb , the computed ratios would become @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , which would leave the conclusions on @xmath158 unchanged .",
    "a comprehensive discussion on the bss population of m 3 has already been presented in f93 .",
    "therefore , here we shall only extend to the bss region the same kind of comparisons with the data - sets of other previous studies in order to verify the quality of the different samples in terms of completeness and selection bias .",
    "we anticipate that the problem of identifying a truly pure sample of bss candidates is far from being solved , in particular in the inner regions of the clusters where crowding undermines photometry and for the faint bss , whose separation from _ normal _ to stars is always difficult and somewhat subjective .",
    "we report below identifications and comparisons made with respect to bhs for the region in common with our newly re - calibrated cfht ccd data .",
    "the comparison will be based on @xmath12 and @xmath14 colours only , because of the poor response of the chip used for the observations in the @xmath11 filter .",
    "figure  [ f : bssp20 ] shows the result of the comparison with the sample obtained by bhs for @xmath130 .",
    "_ panel ( a ) _ shows the data from bhs ( kindly made available to us by dr .",
    "m. bolte ) with their instrumental magnitudes shifted to our system .",
    "the box reproduces the polygonal region used by bhs ( their figure 3 ) for selecting their bss candidates .",
    "open squares are the stars in the bhs sample that are the counterparts of our bss candidates on the bhs field .",
    "_ panel ( b ) _ displays our ccd - sample , restricted to the bhs field .",
    "the box is the same as we used to delimitate the region occupied by our ( f93 ) bss candidates and is identical to that in figure 3 of f93 .",
    "open squares are the stars of our sample which are counterparts of the bss candidates selected by bhs and falling outside our adopted limits . in both panels , black squares represent stars that are considered bss by both surveys .",
    "as can be seen , there are only 15 bss candidates in common ( the black squares ) , while there are 50 stars labeled as bss candidates in only one of the two surveys .",
    "could all of them be mis - selected ; could they actually be _ normal _ stars ?",
    "the answer is difficult to find , but some additional considerations may be useful .",
    "our 25 bss candidates not identified as such by bhs mostly fall between their bss box and their sgb .",
    "judging on the basis of the scatter in the to region , our photometry seems to display smaller internal errors .",
    "this may indicate that we can better separate the two populations because of the different quality of the photometry .",
    "another obvious explanation is , of course , that we reached too close to the ms in defining our bss box . on the other hand , the 10 stars identified as bss candidates only by bhs fall in _ panel ( b ) _ of figure  [ f : bssp20 ] at somewhat brighter magnitudes than the to region . since the quality of the ccd frames available to bhs seems to be better as far as seeing conditions are concerned",
    ", this might imply that we were unable to separate the optical blends formed by a bss - candidate and a sgb star .",
    "@xmath49-data should be suitable to settle the issue .",
    "we have presented the bvi ccd data for about 10,000 stars in the region 0.3",
    "@xmath159 4 of m3 . these data , along with our previous photographic photometry of additional @xmath3 10,000 stars in the external regions as far as 7 , provide a homogeneous and popolous data base for detailed population studies .",
    "completeness has been achieved for all objects with v@xmath318.6 .      *",
    "a new absolute photometric calibration has been obtained .",
    "the comparison with the absolute calibration adopted so far for the same field ( sandage and katem 1982 ) shows that there is a significant colour term , in the sense that our calibration is @xmath20.07 mag redder than sandage and katem ( 1982 ) in the blue range e.g. at b - v=-0.2 , slightly redder ( @xmath2 0.03 mag ) at the instability strip , and @xmath20.08 mag bluer in the reddest part of the cmd , e.g. at b - v=1.6 .",
    "this has important implications in the photometric determination of the metallicity , and in other items such as the period - shift effect which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper . * after completion of our reductions , we became aware of the availability of a new independent photometry of a very wide sample of m3 stars ( about 23,700 ) carried out by k.a .",
    "montgomery ( 1995  m95 ) , fully overlapping our considered regions .",
    "the use of this new catalog has also allowed us to get a link to the photometry presented by stetson and harris ( 1988 ) for an external area , outside our surveyed region . in synthesis",
    ", there are now three independent calibrations referred to observations of landolt s ( 1992 ) standards .",
    "they are in marginal agreement , but it is difficult at the present stage to choose which is the best .",
    "since the calibration here adopted seems to be compatible with that obtained by stetson and harris ( 1988 ) ( they actually show a systematic difference of 0.04 both in b and v , yielding however no colour difference ) , we decided to keep using our new calibration .",
    "* based on these new data and calibration , the metallicity derived from the photometric indicators @xmath5 and @xmath6 is [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 1.45 .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the value -1.66 commonly used for m3 , and is in very good agreement with the most recent metallicity determinations from high resolution spectroscopy of individual stars .",
    "* evidence has been found of the presence of a faint and blue extension of the hb , although scarcely populated .",
    "these stars , however , could be non - genuine hb members but rather the results of merging or collisions .",
    "more photometric and spectroscopic work is needed in order to assess the true nature of these objects .",
    "* from the population ratios of hb , rgb and agb stars we find a value for the helium content y=0.23@xmath70.02 .",
    "this confirms the previous determinations of helium content in globular clusters by this method .",
    "* a significant population of blue straggler stars has been detected and identified .",
    "however the exact number of bss must await hst data for a better space resolution in the most internal regions , for resolving optical blends that may turn pairs of to stars into bss , and in general for a better photometric accuracy .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up studies will be extremely important for a better understanding of the formation mechanisms of these stars .",
    "we wish to thank h. richer and g. fahlman for their collaboration in taking the obervations at the cfht .",
    "we are grateful to the cfht and the calar alto observatories for the kind hospitality and support provided during the observations .",
    "we are specially indebted to k. janes for providing us with his independent sample of m 3 stars in advance of publication , which has allowed us to perform important tests and corrections , and m.bolte for providing us with his data on blue stragglers stars .",
    "we are pleased to acknowledge r.t .",
