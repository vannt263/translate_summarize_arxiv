    "recently , the modified theories of gravitation have attracted the attention of a huge community of theoretical physicists due to their implication as an alternative framework for the successful proposal of dark energy .",
    "this modification is carried out in several ways by modifying the lagrangian of general relativity ( gr ) , for examples ricci scalar @xmath2 in the einstein - hilbert action must be replaced by @xmath3 ( see durrer and maartens 2010 ; de felice and tsujikawa 20210 ) . in gr and modified theories of gravity ,",
    "the gravitational effects could be described in term of contents of matter and curvature of spacetime .",
    "however , one can formulate an analogous theory of gr , which can be demonstrated in term of torsion instead of curvature .",
    "originally , einstein formulated this theory to unify the basic forces due to coulomb field and gravitational field einstein ( 1928 ) .",
    "this problem of unification remains unsolved in the new theory , but after many years the theory becomes much popular as an alternative theory of gr , this theory is known as teleparallel equivalent of gr ( tegr ) m@xmath4ller ( 1961 ) .",
    "the basic concept to formulate this theory is to take a such manifold that preserve torsion along with curvature .",
    "the complete riemann curvature tensor can be considered as zero , hence in this way gravitational field can be described by torsion .",
    "the appropriate technique is to utilize the tetrad fields @xmath5 weitzenb@xmath4ck ( 1923 ) .    during the current years",
    ", the researchers have carried out the study of tegr with some modification to explore some theoretical as well experimental problems of modern cosmology ( ferraro and fiorini 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "the comparison of @xmath3 gravity with @xmath1 gravity implies that later one is more convenient as in @xmath1 gravity , equations of motions are of second order while for metric @xmath6 gravity , these equations are fourth order . recently , a lot of work in @xmath7 gravity is devoted to investigate the observed data of the theoretical cosmology or to determine the constraint on the parameter of theory , so that the theoretical results may fit with the data obtained by some standard source like wmap etc .",
    "further , many researchers have investigated that a particular class of @xmath8 gravity models can explain some basic problems of cosmology like inflation and accelerated expansion ( bengochea and ferraro 2009 wu and yu 2010 ) .",
    "in addition to study the cosmology , @xmath1 theory has been used to examined the effects of @xmath1 models on the existence of black hole and compact objects in 3-dimensions . on the basis of this fact , the btz black hole model has been derived in @xmath1 theory of gravity .",
    "( zheng and huang 2011 ) .",
    "also , it has been proved that the first of black hole thermodynamics in @xmath1 gravity becomes invalid , due to the break down of lorentz invariance ( bengochea 2011 ) .",
    "further , some static vacuum solutions with charged source have been investigated in @xmath1 theory , such solutions leads to charged black hole solutions in @xmath1 gravity ( li et al.2011 ) . a large class of static perfect fluid solutions exhibit the existence of relativistic stars in @xmath1 gravity ( dent et al.2011 , rong - xin et al.2011 ; wang et al .",

    ", we shall introduce the basic concepts of the @xmath11 gravity theory .",
    "to this end , we define notation of the latin indices for the tetrad field and greek indices for spacetime coordinates . the line element of the manifold is given by @xmath12 this spacetime can be transformed to a minkowskian form by the matrix transformation as follows : @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
