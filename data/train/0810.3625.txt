    "an inflationary scenario @xcite may be termed successful if the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "the number of e - foldings is sufficient to resolve the horizon and flatness problems . 2 .",
    "the predicted temperature anisotropies , scalar spectral index @xmath4 , tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 , etc . , are in agreement with the observations .",
    "3 .   following inflation ,",
    "there exists a mechanism for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "4 .   the number density of superheavy magnetic monopoles in guts is suitably suppressed to agree with the upper bounds on their primordial abundance . 5 .   the model should offer a plausible cold dark matter candidate .",
    "it was shown a long time ago @xcite that non - supersymmetric gut inflation can be realized by employing a coleman - weinberg ( cw ) type potential for a scalar inflaton field which must be a gut singlet .",
    "the singlet condition ensures that radiative corrections from the gauge sector do not spoil the desired inflationary potential .",
    "the monopole problem is resolved by requiring that the gut symmetry breaking , associated with monopole production , takes place during inflation . a suitable coupling between the gut symmetry breaking field @xmath6 and the inflaton field @xmath7 is thus needed .",
    "this coupling also plays a crucial role in generating an appropriate cw inflationary potential for @xmath7 .",
    "the most recent wmap 5-year @xcite analyses seem to favor a scalar spectral index centered around 0.96 . within the cw framework",
    "this favors an energy scale for inflation which is close to ( 1 - 2)@xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "this result , as we will show here , has far reaching implications for the symmetry breaking scale of the underlying gut . in our cw examples below , primarily based on so(10 ) , the superheavy gauge bosons which mediate proton decay are typically a factor 2 - 4 larger in mass than the energy scale of inflation preferred by wmap5 . to phrase things somewhat differently , while the most recent proton lifetime limits from super - k ( @xmath9 years @xcite ) require that @xmath10 gev @xcite , the limits on @xmath11 from wmap seem to favor a value which is up to a factor 10 larger .",
    "we thus estimate a proton lifetime of around @xmath1-@xmath2 years .",
    "proton lifetime estimates of order @xmath1 years are achieved in some so(10 ) axion models which contain scalar leptoquarks ( 3,1,-2/3 ) with an intermediate mass of order @xmath12 gev .    as an alternative to the cw potential",
    ", we will also discuss inflation with a higgs potential @xcite , as well as implications for proton decay .",
    "as we will see , such a model predicts values for the scalar spectral index @xmath4 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 , the scale of vacuum energy and the proton lifetime that are quite similar to those predicted by the cw model .",
    "to simplify the presentation we begin with a brief summary based on su(5 ) , following references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model contains an su(5 ) singlet ( real ) scalar @xmath7 which develops a cw potential from its weak couplings to the adjoint and fundamental higgs fields @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "the tree - level scalar potential is given by    @xmath14    the coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are taken to be of order @xmath19 , so that most radiative corrections in the ( @xmath6 , @xmath13 ) sector can be neglected .",
    "we assume a somewhat smaller value for the coefficient @xmath20 and take @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the mass of the superheavy gauge bosons @xmath43 which mediate proton decay is given by    @xmath44    thus @xmath11 is estimated to be a factor 2 - 4 larger than the scale of vacuum energy during inflation .",

    "( [ cwp ] ) is typical for the new inflation scenario @xcite , where inflation takes place near the maximum .",
