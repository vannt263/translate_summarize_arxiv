    "evacuation through a doorway or a narrowing is a long - standing issue . in homer",
    "s _ odyssey _ , odysseus and his men need to escape from a cave without being noticed by its blinded guardian , polyphemus the cyclops , who relies on his sense of touch to mount guard ; they manage to do so by tying themselves to the undersides of sheep . nowadays",
    ", the possibility to evacuate quickly and safely from a public facility or building in emergency conditions should be ensured by the compliance with building codes @xcite .",
    "these codes may be prescription - based or performance - based @xcite , depending on whether they constrain certain design elements , e.g. , door widths , or set quantitative goals , such as permitting the evacuation of @xmath6 persons within a given time .",
    "a central issue is then the assessment of exit capacities @xmath1 , that is , the number of people who can walk through a given exit per unit time .",
    "often , @xmath1 is evaluated on the basis of tabulated values resulting from empirical observations or controlled experiments .",
    "the required amount of tabulated data can be reduced by defining a specific capacity @xmath7 , i.e. , a capacity per metre width , so that @xmath8 for a narrowing of width @xmath9 .",
    "this simplification relies on the assumption of a roughly linear growth of @xmath1 with @xmath9 , which is supported by some experimental evidence@xcite , at least at moderate pedestrian densities and for @xmath10 . when the exit width @xmath9 is varied , kretz et al .",
    "@xcite reported a moderate decrease of @xmath7 with @xmath9 , whereas seyfried et al .",
    "@xcite found a slight increase .",
    "reference @xcite stands out in the literature , in that it suggests a stepwise increase of the capacity with @xmath9 , due to the formation of equally spaced lanes , but this hypothesis stems from very limited evidence ( only two widths were studied ) . ]    unfortunately , as often emphasised in the literature @xcite , the tabulated capacities vary widely between handbooks or papers : for instance , for constrictions of width @xmath11 , we find @xmath12 in the sfpe handbook @xcite , @xmath13 in the `` planning for foot traffic flow in buildings''@xcite , @xmath14 in kretz et al.@xcite , and @xmath15 in seyfried et al .  @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are ascribed to various factors . to start with , the use of distinct measurement methods , e.g.",
    ", the recourse to either spatial or temporal averages to define the flow or the density , has been incriminated and can indeed lead to different results , especially at high densities , even in a simple single - file flow @xcite ; but zhang et al .",
    "came to the conclusion that this point only has a relatively minor impact at lower densities @xcite . besides this technical aspect",
    ", cultural differences between populations may play a role ; their importance is however debated , notably owing to the similarity in the measurements performed in the london underground ( uk ) and in osaka business district ( japan ) , as mentioned by seyfried et al.@xcite .",
    "the composition of the population and the associated morphological differences are arguably of greater importance , with higher flow rates for crowds consisting of children @xcite ( @xmath16 ) , due to their smaller size .",
    "furthermore , it was found that short bottlenecks ( mimicking the passage through a doorway ) allowed higher flow rates than longer ones , which simulate the entrance to a narrow corridor @xcite ; in the former case , it is possible to slither around the door jamb . perhaps for similar reasons , trying to predict an exit capacity on the basis of the peak value of the flow rate _ vs. _ density curve for a simple uni - directional flow ( the so called fundamental diagram ) tends to underestimate the actual capacity @xcite .",
    "even more notably , the density of the pedestrian crowd at the beginning of the evacuation strongly impacts the flow rate @xmath1 , with a faster flow for initially denser crowds @xcite . not unrelated to this dependence on the initial configuration",
    "is the question of the stationarity of the pedestrian flow @xcite : often the measurements are not performed in the stationary regime , which further complicates the interpretation of the results .    to study the evacuation dynamics in simpler , or experimentally more tractable , systems ,",
    "researchers have investigated constricted flows of less complex entities , such as vibrated grains@xcite , ants@xcite , and sheep @xcite , and brought to light similarities with pedestrians ( for ants , the analogy is however debated @xcite ) .",
    "but the complex psychology of humans adds a level of complexity to their response .",
    "in particular , on account of their individual characters , pedestrians exhibit diverse reactions to external stimuli and variable behaviours . in a series of repetitive evacuation experiments , habituation and boredom may lead to considerable variations between repetitions @xcite . besides , most of the aforementioned research focuses on pedestrian flows in normal , cooperative conditions , and competitive evacuation experiments are rare , probably because of the risks they present ,",
    "although in reality impatient , competitive , aggressive or vying behaviours are also observed in some situations @xcite . among but a few other examples , muir et al.@xcite simulated the evacuation from an aircraft , in which the participants competitiveness was whetted by the possibility of a reward ; nagai et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the evacuation of relatively competitive crawlers and walkers ; helbing et al . conducted panic - like evacuation experiments , but with only about 20 participants .",
    "( also see ref .",
    "@xcite for a study of uni - directional flows , with some prescribed participants behaviours ) .",
    "more recently , in a series of papers@xcite , garcimartn , zuriguel , and co - workers carried out a detailed analysis of controlled evacuations in which distinct levels of competitiveness were prescribed to the crowd .",
    "( also see @xcite for experiments in a virtual environment . )",
    "it is noteworthy that , compared to the values reported above for normal conditions , the specific capacities measured in those ( diversely ) competitive settings are considerably larger : @xmath17 in the work of nagai et al.@xcite and helbing et al.@xcite , @xmath18 in garcimartn et al.s paper@xcite for door widths of 70 to 80 cm .",
    "however , these evacuations were performed with crowds of homogeneous competitiveness . to get greater insight into the effect of the individual pedestrians behaviours , we conduct and analyse controlled evacuations through a narrow doorway with participants that are prescribed",
    "_ distinct _",
    "behaviours , namely , either a polite or a selfish behaviour .",
    "we also vary their eagerness to egress .",
    "although these behavioural aspects add yet another component to a complex problem , the global picture of the evacuation process is clarified by considering a ( well - nigh ) stationary regime and seeking robust `` microscopic '' characteristics of the flow .",
    "let us mention that a concise account of the _ global _ flow properties observed in these experiments was proposed in a preliminary report@xcite .",
    "the evacuation experiments were performed in the gymnasium of centro atmico bariloche ( cab ) , argentina , and involved more than 80 voluntary participants ( students and researchers ) , aged 20 to 55 for the greatest part , with a woman / man ratio of about 1:3 .",
    "the participants were asked to evacuate a delimited area through a @xmath19-wide door ; the geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "this doorway was created by moving @xmath20-thick sliding walls .",
    "safety was a central concern .",
    "accordingly , the door jambs were padded with training mats , which reduced the aperture to 72 cm . in addition , because of the possible ethics and safety issues , the protocol was validated beforehand by a local ethics committee and the experiments were prepared in collaboration with the safety and hygiene group of cab .",
    "the evacuation process was supervised by three staff members who could stop it at any moment by blowing a whistle .",
    "the experimental design is directly inspired by the experiments of zuriguel s group@xcite , but we introduced some important changes . in each evacuation experiment , a fraction @xmath21 of the participants was told to behave selfishly while the rest should behave politely .",
    "the selfish agents were selected randomly and varied between the experiments ; they were asked to wear a red headscarf to be recognisable on the videos .",
    "they were allowed to `` elbow their way through the crowd , with mild contacts but no violence whatsoever '' .",
    "their polite counterparts , on the other hand , were to `` avoid any contact and try to keep their distance '' . before each experiment , all participants were asked to walk as close as possible to the door , without crossing it .",
    "only then did we announce who would behave selfishly in the upcoming run .",
    "the session started with a mock evacuation .",
    "then , in a first series of experiments , here referred to as experiments with _ placid _ walkers , all participants were instructed to `` head for the door '' , without further specification . in the second series , they were told , in addition , to `` walk purposefully ( _ con ganas _ in spanish ) , but without running , pushing or hitting others '' ; in this case , the walkers are said to be _",
    "overall , the experiments lasted for somewhat more than one hour .    finally , the often reported lack of stationarity in the flow , along with the word of caution in ref .",
    "@xcite about the risk of faulty statistics with too small crowds , raised strong concerns in our minds about finite - size effects .",
    "to curb these effects , we decided to innovate by imposing `` periodic boundary conditions '' on the crowd : after egressing , participants followed a circuit that led to their re - injection into the room .",
    "in fact , to optimise the randomisation and limit the clustering of , say , fast participants , two re - injection circuits were set up , a short one and a longer one , and the evacuees were directed to either one alternatively . with this contrivance , about 250 passages through the door ( between 177 and 352 , to be precise ) were obtained in each experiment .",
    ", @xmath22 , and the door is @xmath19-wide .",
    "the short and long re - injection circuits are approximately @xmath23 and @xmath24 long , respectively . ]      to complement our controlled experiments , we filmed the egresses from a conference room at the various breaks of the trefemac conference , a three - day physics workshop held at cab .",
    "the participants were informed of the recording once and for all . some tendency to align before passing through the 82-cm - wide exit door",
    "was observed ; the door was opened at more than @xmath25 .",
    "the data , presented in fig .",
    "3e of the main paper , consist of about 260 individual passages .",
    "we also filmed two collective egresses from the auditorium of cab at the end of the weekly seminars .",
    "the 75-cm - wide door was fully open and the 50 to 100 participants were unaware of the recording",
    ". some were carrying a chair when passing through the doorway .",
    "the data , presented in fig .  3f , consist of about 150 individual passages .",
    "in these uncontrolled settings , large time lapses between egresses are irrelevant here , insofar as they are due to the foot - dragging of participants within the conference room , rather than to the dynamics at the exit .",
    "the controlled evacuations were recorded with two 60hz , large - angle go pro cameras and one standard 60hz camera .",
    "two cameras were placed above the door , and one filmed the crowd in the room from a more distant point of view .",
    "some of the videos are available as supplemental materials .    with respect to the image analysis ,",
    "a standard method to get the egress times is to build a time line of passages ( see supplementary fig .",
    "s1 ) by extracting a few lines of pixels just past the door from all video frames and then stitching them together . but to get more comprehensive information , we resort to a more exhaustive semi - manual analysis .",
    "we define the exit zone as the @xmath26 semi - circular area in front of the door shown in supplementary fig .",
    "s2 and we flick through all video frames , down - rated to 30hz , clicking on the participants heads when they enter the exit zone and pressing a dedicated key when they cross a line beyond the door .",
    "both methods agree very well regarding the exit times .",
    "thus , the density @xmath2 is assessed by detecting the pedestrians first entrance into the exit zone .",
    "this method creates a small artefact in the most competitive evacuations , in which a few participants were shortly pushed out of the zone , due to a crowd movement , before moving in again and passing the door , a possibility that is discarded in our routine , hence a slight overestimation of the density in the zone in these cases .",
    "moreover , no correction for optical distortion was performed , because we used the central part of the images . despite this central position",
    ", the parallax resulting from the camera not being strictly at the zenith ( owing to the impossibility to place it high enough ) implies that the moment of detection of a given participant s entrance into the exit zone somewhat depends on their height .",
    "this results in a slight inaccuracy with respect to the effective area of the zone in front of the door , hence the use of a pre - factor @xmath27 in the definition of the density unit ( @xmath28 ) .      wherever relevant ,",
    "we show error bars on the graphs to give an idea of the uncertainty due to the finite number of measurements we performed . in these cases ,",
    "the data points are obtained as averages over a sub - sample of our measurements ; the error bars are systematically @xmath29 on each side of the plotted data point , where @xmath30 is the standard deviation of the sub - sample and @xmath31 is the sub - sample size . under the reasonable assumptions that the sample points are approximately uncorrelated and that the central limit theorem applies , the error bar then represents a 95% confidence interval .",
    "note however that this definition of the confidence interval is valid only in the limit of large @xmath31 , whereas in our case @xmath31 is generally of order 100 - 300 ( in fig .  [",
    "fig : t_w](right ) , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the experiments went as planned , without incident .",
    "the re - injection process operated properly : the flow was limited by the passage through the doorway , and not by travel times in the re - injection circuits .",
    "some selfish agents tried to overtake the rest of the crowd by walking near the lateral boundaries of the delimited area , instead of going into the thick of the crowd .",
    "more generally , we observed the formation of files of a few selfish agents following each other and taking advantage of the ` voids ' opened by their predecessors .",
    "we believe that this follows from a general mechanism of clustering via a coupling between the structure of the medium and the motion of the particles ( for instance , the pairing of electrons in a superconductor @xcite ) , although it is true that , here , the formation of files may have been facilitated by the conspicuousness of the headscarf - wearing selfish agents .",
    "importantly , given that selfish agents made their way faster , they were re - injected into the room more frequently .",
    "accordingly , the effective fraction @xmath33 of selfish evacuees is generally larger than the prescribed ( nominal ) fraction @xmath0",
    ". the results below will be presented as a function of @xmath33 , where relevant , rather than @xmath0 .    for polite crowds ,",
    "i.e. , at low @xmath33 , the evacuation looks orderly and contacts between pedestrians are avoided .",
    "some polite participants yield deliberately and may even wave to their neighbours to go ahead .",
    "very generally , there is no more than one pedestrian crossing the door at each time . for larger @xmath33 ,",
    "the crowd in front of the door becomes more compact , contacts surge , and the flow looks more chaotic as several pedestrians try to walk through the door simultaneously .",
    "such endeavours sometimes lead to clogs due to the formation of ` arches ' of three to four participants across the door , particularly at @xmath34 . but these clogs are rapidly resolved , in about one second or less , and do not _ substantially _ delay the flow . in the most competitive evacuations ( @xmath35(purposeful ) and",
    "@xmath36(purposeful ) ) , some agents grasp the door jamb and use it to pull themselves past the door ; a few pedestrians spin around upon egressing , because of the contacts with their neighbours .",
    "to go beyond these general observations , we extract the exit times @xmath37 of each pedestrian @xmath38 , numbered according to their order of egress , regardless of their identity ( see methods for details ) .",
    "this allows us to compute the time - dependent flow rate @xmath39 , which is a moving average over a time window @xmath40 , for each evacuation , viz .",
    ", @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the heaviside function , viz .",
    ", @xmath43 if @xmath44 , 0 otherwise . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the curve @xmath39 is extremely jagged , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowrates_7](left ) .",
    "it consists of somewhat irregular spikes that are all the larger as the evacuation is competitive ( at large @xmath33 ) . but",
    "averaging over a larger time window , @xmath46 , yields a smoother curve , whose relative flatness proves that , macroscopically , the pedestrian flow is quasi - stationary .",
    "interestingly , this quasi - stationary is reached almost immediately after the beginning of the experiments and persists until at least a dozen seconds before their ends(purposeful ) is a slight exception , insofar as the flow rate wanes moderately in the last 30 or 40 seconds . ] .",
    "the density of pedestrians in the exit zone is also roughly stationary in general ( see supplementary fig .",
    "our observation of macroscopically quasi - stationary dynamics contrasts with the non - stationary flows found in a number of related works@xcite .",
    "we see two main reasons for this contrast : a 3-m - large gap ( 1-m - large in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in front of the exit was initially left free of participants in ref .",
    "@xcite , which explains the existence of a transient regime , and no re - injection of the participants was enforced in those earlier experiments .",
    "no matter how limited the transient effects are in our case , to further reduce them , we henceforth discard the first three and the last ten seconds of all experiments .",

    "the dots represent the experiments with placid participants and the triangles , the purposeful ones .",
    "the dashed line is the prediction of the naive model presented in the text .",
    "the geometrical prefactor @xmath51 in the density unit is due to experimental uncertainty . ]",
    "we now compute the global flow rates @xmath1 for each evacuation and list them in table  [ tab : global ] .",
    "overall , @xmath1 grows monotonically with the concentration @xmath33 of selfish agents , and a peak value of 2.4 persons per second is reached at @xmath36 . but",
    "@xmath1 also increases when the placid crowd is asked to walk purposefully ( irrespective of the individual behaviours ) : for the same value of @xmath33 , namely 71% , @xmath1 surges by almost 30% following this change .",
    "this sensitivity to the participants attitudes , while the geometry and the crowd are kept fixed , renders the divergence of published values for the exit capacity quite understandable .",
    "turning to a comparison with these published values , we see that the specific capacity corresponding to the placid polite crowd ( @xmath52 ) is comparable to the rather conservative specification of the sfpe handbook@xcite , namely , @xmath53 , while the specific capacity for the purposeful polite crowd ( @xmath54 ) is similar to kretz et al.s measurement @xcite ( @xmath55 ) for a flow through @xmath56-wide , @xmath57-long bottleneck in normal conditions , and comparable to the value @xmath58 reported by seyfried et al.@xcite for a flow through @xmath59-wide , @xmath60-long bottleneck in normal conditions . at the other extreme , the highest flow rate that we measured , @xmath61 for @xmath36(purposeful ) ,",
    "is slightly below , but similar to , the range of flow rates obtained in the more or less competitive evacuations of pastor et al.@xcite ( @xmath62 ) for a 69-cm - wide ( instead of 72 here ) door .",
    "the increase of @xmath1 with @xmath33 and with the agents purposefulness in our experiments points to the absence of ` faster - is - slower ' effect , or , better said , a ` more - competitive - is - slower ' effect .",
    "this may seem to be at odds with the conclusions of pastor et al .",
    "@xcite , but we claim that there is no contradiction : unlike @xcite , our experiments are not ( all ) above the threshold of competitiveness required to observe this effect . indeed , in @xcite , competitive participants were allowed to push each other with stretched arms , unlike in ours ; the larger competitiveness is also reflected by the larger flow rates that they measured .",
    "the granular analogy then helps clarify the consequence of this difference @xcite : in a granular hopper flow , as the panel supporting the grains is tilted and the effective gravity increases accordingly , in a first regime the flow becomes faster , because grains fall faster , but then it slows down under higher gravity .",
    "this slowdown is due to the stabilisation of clog - inducing arches by pressure .",
    "models for pedestrian dynamics premised on newton s equations with `` social forces '' predict a similar non - monotonic effect of the pedestrians desired velocity @xcite . as this velocity",
    "is increased , in a first regime the evacuation gets faster , but a second regime then emerges , where the repulsive forces between clustered pedestrians at the exit exceed the driving force associated with the desired velocity ; the ensuing congestion reduces the flow rate .",
    "we presume that the evacuations of @xcite are all within the second regime , whereas ours are not .",
    "we have already noted that the flow rate is not uniquely determined by @xmath33 in our experiments .",
    "following seyfried et al.s @xcite idea that the discrepancies between the exit capacities in the literature are largely due to different initial crowd densities , we investigate the dependence of @xmath1 on the density @xmath2 in the exit zone ( a @xmath63 semi - circular area in front of the door ) . some experimental uncertainty regarding our density measurements , detailed in the subsection _ video analysis _ of _ methods _ , notably leads us to introduce a pre - factor @xmath64 in the density unit ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the highest densities that we report , namely @xmath66 , may appear intriguingly large ; it should however be emphasised that here @xmath2 is not the average density in the crowd , but its _ local _ value near the exit , where pedestrians are most densely packed ; previous works have already shed light on the considerable deviations between the average density and its peak local value @xcite .    the graph @xmath67 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowrates_7](right ) confirms the relevance of the density parameter : the flow rates measured for different behavioural prescriptions collapse onto a smooth master curve .",
    "the monotonic increase of the flow rate @xmath1 with @xmath2 is remarkable . at low densities ,",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath1 and its growth with @xmath2 can be rationalised rather straightforwardly .",
    "first , notice that pedestrians in the exit zone are separated by @xmath68 on average .",
    "besides , they generally egress one by one and lower their velocity when the door is blocked by somebody else s passage . should one crudely assume that this produces a halt , after which they gather speed as @xmath69 with a final velocity @xmath70 and a response time @xmath71 , one will easily obtain the time interval required to walk a distance @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( provided that @xmath74 ) , hence a flow rate @xmath75 .",
    "this is undoubtedly a very crude model , but its prediction , represented as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowrates_7](right ) ) , is in broad agreement with the low - density data .",
    "much more surprisingly , @xmath1 keeps increasing up to high densities , @xmath76 , contrary to most fundamental diagrams in the literature , which predict its decline above much smaller densities@xcite ( see fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "the slight uncertainty in our assessment of the density can hardly be the cause of discrepancy : in the highest - density experiment , at @xmath77 , the crowd is tightly packed near the door , which is consistent with the reported density value .",
    "instead , it is likely that at such high densities the flow rate is not uniquely determined by @xmath2 , but strongly depends on other parameters , such as the pressure in the crowd .",
    "indeed , the tightly - packed crowd is nearly incompressible ; therefore , the mechanical pressure can increase vastly , hence stabilising clogs , while @xmath2 only changes little . crowd turbulence",
    "@xcite may also arise , thereby affecting the density and flow . in our settings , excessive mechanical pressures and turbulence",
    "were warded off thanks to the strict instructions given to the participants .",
    "importantly , the dependence of the flow rate on the density holds not only for the mean values of these quantities , but also for their temporal fluctuations . indeed , as exposed in the supplementary information ( supplementary fig .",
    "s4 ) , with 95% confidence , flow rate fluctuations are positively correlated with density fluctuations in the vast majority of the experiments , provided that one considers moving averages of these fluctuations over time windows @xmath78 .      on average , the flow rate is related to the mean time lapse @xmath79 between successive egresses via @xmath80 .",
    "but , since fluctuations are large , it is actually worth considering the full distribution @xmath81 of time lapses . figure  [ fig : time_lapses ] reveals substantial differences in these distributions when the crowd behaviour is varied .",
    "evacuations with a mostly polite crowd display a relatively sharp peak at a characteristic time @xmath82 slightly below one second , and a depleted region at low @xmath83 .",
    "interestingly , these features are also observed in uncontrolled collective egresses from conference rooms through doorways of similar widths , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_lapses]e - f ( these uncontrolled egresses are described in the supplementary information ) .    on the other hand , competitive egresses at large @xmath33 ( in our controlled experiments ) do not present a very well defined peak and the most frequent time lapses are shifted to smaller values .",
    "most conspicuously , they include a non - negligible fraction of very short time lapses @xmath84 , which correspond to quasi - simultaneous egresses .",
    "focusing on the large values of @xmath83 , caused by congestion , the data corresponding to our most competitive evacuation ( @xmath36 , purposeful ) seem to support garcimartin et al.s@xcite claim of a slow decay of @xmath81 at large @xmath83 , characterised by a power - law - like tail : we find a higher likelihood for the tail to be power - law - like than exponential ( @xmath85 for a continuous data set , according to the method of clauset et al.@xcite implemented in citealstott2014powerlaw ) .",
    "in other situations , our data are insufficient to validate this claim , and even tend to contradict it in the most polite evacuations .     between egresses for different evacuations .",
    "the first four panels correspond to experiments for ( a ) @xmath86(placid ) , ( b ) @xmath87(placid ) , ( c ) @xmath35(purposeful ) , ( d ) @xmath36(purposeful ) .",
    "the last two panels correspond to uncontrolled egresses ( see the text ) from ( e ) a conference room during a three - day congress and ( f ) the auditorium of cab at the end of the weekly seminars . ]",
    "the existence of short time lapses @xmath83 hints at bursty dynamics . here",
    ", passages through the door will belong to a burst of escapes if they are separated by less than 60% of the mean time lapse of the considered experiment , viz .",
    ", @xmath88 ( the results are obviously robust to small variations of this criterion ) .",
    "thus defined , bursts do not correspond to intervals of fast flow separated by long clogs ( only short - lived clogs were observed here ) , but to almost simultaneous escapes .",
    "the distribution @xmath89 of burst sizes is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : burst_sizes ] . as expected , evacuations of polite crowds consist of isolated escapes , with a small proportion of bursts of @xmath90 pedestrians or more ( @xmath91 , with probability @xmath92 ) , whereas bursts of up to @xmath93 pedestrians are observed with more selfish and competitive crowds .",
    "our data are perfectly compatible with the ( fast ) exponential decay of @xmath89 reported in @xcite , but are insufficient to be assertive in this regard .",
    "incidentally , note that , in all but one experiment ( @xmath94(purposeful ) ) , the average fraction of selfish agents in a burst increases with the size of the burst .",
    "this is particularly noticeable in the `` placid '' experiments .",
    "however , collecting statistics over the entire evacuation , we have not detected substantial temporal correlations in the behaviours of successively egressing participants .",
    "( i.e. , egresses coming in rapid succession ) in the evacuations with purposeful walkers . ]      although successions of @xmath91 short time lapses exist ( bursts of size @xmath91 ) , statistically anti - correlations between successive @xmath83 prevail by far , in all experiments but two ( @xmath95(placid ) and , to a lesser extent , @xmath96(placid ) ) .",
    "this is apparent in the negative dip in the correlation functions of successive time lapses @xmath97 ( ordered by the rank of egress ) , @xmath98 where the brackets denote an average over all pedestrians @xmath99 in the experiment , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_t_correl ] .",
    "this means that , in general , there is an alternation between shorter time lapses and longer ones .",
    "such an alternation has already been observed in cooperative pedestrian flows at the entrance of ( long ) bottlenecks @xcite .",
    "it was then ascribed to a `` zipper effect '' , whereby pedestrian lanes form in the bottleneck and need to be intercalated , because the bottleneck width does not allow pedestrians from different lanes to stand shoulder to shoulder . within each lane ,",
    "the headway that pedestrians maintain with respect to the walker just in front of them ( of order one second in @xcite ) imposes a finite minimal distance between the pedestrians .",
    "but this does not apply across lanes , so that a pedestrian may come close to contact with a walker from a neighbouring lane , without being able overtake this neighbour because of the constrained lateral space .",
    "however , in our experiments , strong anti - correlations are also seen in very competitive and disorderly evacuations , for instance at @xmath36(purposeful ) , in which no lanes whatsoever can form . to explain this , we believe that the `` zipper '' mechanism can be generalised : if some free space is available right in front of them , pedestrians will step forward and try to cross the door at ( almost ) the same time as their predecessor who comes from another direction . but they will not risk this manoeuvre if there is not sufficient headway just in front of them , in particular if a competition for the exit already blocks the door . to bolster our claim , let us study the pedestrians angles of incidence @xmath100 into the exit zone , the angle @xmath101 corresponding to normal incidence ( `` at the centre '' ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath100 are approximately flat over an interval of the form @xmath102 $ ] , where the maximal angle @xmath103 seems to increase with the competitiveness of the evacuation .",
    "more relevantly , we remark that the directions @xmath100 exhibit strong anti - correlations in time , pointing to the prevalence of alternations between small and large @xmath100 .",
    "this is striking , for instance , in the autocorrelation function , @xmath104 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_t_correl](right ) for @xmath36(purposeful ) , where the negative dip for successively egressing pedestrians ( @xmath105 ) lies more than @xmath106 below 0 , where @xmath30 is the standard deviation of the autocorrelations of @xmath100 ( whose average gives @xmath107 ) and @xmath31 is the number of points used to compute the average .",
    "moreover , if pedestrians @xmath38 and @xmath108 egress in fast succession ( @xmath109 ) , their angles of incidence differ more on average than if there is more delay between their egresses ( @xmath110 ) in strictly _ all _ experiments , with the most marked contrasts for polite crowds ( e.g. , @xmath111 vs. @xmath112 for @xmath86(purposeful ) ) .",
    "this confirms that the short time lapses correspond to a participant from _ another _ direction passing through the door very shortly after the previous one .",
    "conversely , the headway left behind a participant coming from the same direction is reflected by the fact that one systematically has to wait longer ( on average and in median ) to see another participant egress from the same direction ( within @xmath113 ) than from a randomly selected direction in the empirical distribution of @xmath100 .",
    "the foregoing discussion implies that time lapses @xmath83 longer than the median value are not due to slower , lazier , or more patient pedestrians , but result from the organisation of the constricted flow .",
    "we should mention that the alternations between short and long @xmath83 are absent from our data sets for uncontrolled egresses , where people generally passed through the door one by one , in an orderly and non - competitive way , sometimes even starting to align beforehand .     and",
    "@xmath114 , averaged over @xmath99 ( left ) and correlations between the angles of incidence @xmath100 of a pedestrian and his or her @xmath115-th successor ( right ) .",
    "the error bars represent 95% confidence intervals . ]",
    "so far we have focused on the time lapses between egresses .",
    "but , from the individual pedestrian s perspective , a possibly more relevant duration is the time they have to wait in the above - defined exit zone , of area @xmath116 , before they can egress .",
    "let us call this dwell time ( or waiting time ) @xmath117 .",
    "its mean value @xmath118 is related to the mean time lapse via @xmath119 ; the derivation is presented as supplementary information .     in the exit zone in evacuations with purposeful walkers .",
    "normalised histograms of @xmath117 for @xmath86(purposeful ) ( left ) and @xmath36(purposeful ) ( middle ) .",
    "the right panel shows the average dwell time for selfish , purposeful pedestrians as a function of the number @xmath120 of selfish participants in the zone , for distinct numbers of polite participants .",
    "the error bars are 95% confidence intervals . ]    sharply peaked distributions @xmath121 correspond to orderly evacuations , with approximately equal waiting times for all .",
    "this case is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_w](left ) , for @xmath86(purposeful ) . on the contrary , broad @xmath121",
    "reveal the presence of heterogeneity and/or disorder . for @xmath36(purposeful ) , since the crowd is behaviourally homogeneous , the breadth of @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t_w](right ) ) has to be ascribed to disorder . on the other hand , for inhomogeneous crowds , the overall distribution @xmath121 mingles the two distinct types of pedestrians .    to refine the analysis , we study the histograms of @xmath117 as a function of the pedestrian s behaviour , namely , whether they are polite agents ( pola ) or selfish moving agents ( selma ) , and their direction of incidence into the exit zone : from the left ( @xmath122 ) , from the centre ( @xmath123 ) , or from the right ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "an example of such a histogram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_w_dist_direc ] . beyond the statistical noise",
    ", we see that , in all cases , the distributions are peaked at a value around @xmath125 and , as expected , pola s distributions are shifted to larger @xmath117 , and stretched , compared to selma s . for either type of behaviour , the distributions look relatively similar for all incident directions,(purposeful ) , where the average waiting time differs by more than @xmath126",
    ". this could be due to statistical noise , individual preferences for one side , or a slight , unnoticed asymmetry in the setup . ] with a noticeable exception : polas display more frequent outliers at large @xmath117 if they come from the sides than if they come from the centre . indeed",
    ", pola tends to be swept along by the pedestrian stream if she comes from the centre , whereas she can be blocked at the sides of the door otherwise .",
    "there is no such a marked effect for selma , probably because the latter tries her hardest , and manages , to egress rapidly in any event .    .",
    "the stars indicate the mean value in each case . ]",
    "how do the @xmath117 depend on the population in the exit zone ( averaged over the pedestrian s dwell time ) ? figure  [ fig : t_w](right ) evinces that , in the purposeful experiments , selma s mean waiting time very generally grows with the number of selfish agents in the zone , for any fixed number of polite ones , and also increases when there are more polite participants , for a fixed number of selfish ones .",
    "these features hold true in the placid experiments ( supplementary fig .",
    "s6 ) , with the exception that @xmath127 seems to shorten in the competitive situations where 3 participants are simultaneously in the zone , perhaps due to a sampling bias . on the whole",
    ", these observations also apply for pola s waiting times , but the picture is less clear . the positive correlation between the waiting time and the occupancy of the zone is intuitive , but not entirely trivial , because escapes come in faster succession if the zone is more crowded .",
    "the aforementioned correlations are only valid in a statistical sense .",
    "we have not found any law that can accurately predict @xmath117 as a function of the local parameters .",
    "nevertheless , can some generally valid `` priority rules '' for the flow be unveiled ? making a list of the pedestrians that an agent of a given type yields to , that is to say , the pedestrians that entered the zone later than this agent but egressed before , we find that overall selma yields to fewer pedestrians than pola and that , for both types , it is more common to yield to selfish pedestrians than to polite ones , which is not so surprising .",
    "it should however be stressed that this tendency is not systematic : polite agents ( possibly carried along by the pedestrian flow ) also overtake their selfish counterparts from time to time . on the other hand , in virtually no instance",
    "does selma yield to a polite pedestrian coming from the same direction ( left , centre or right ) .",
    "this rule only suffers two exceptions over the whole set of experiments .      clearly , these `` priority rules '' are limited in scope and can not tell us how orderly the flow is . to quantify disorder ,",
    "we choose to compute the average difference @xmath128 between the order of entrance @xmath129 of pedestrian _ i _ in the zone and their order of egress @xmath130 , viz .",
    ", @xmath131 .",
    "the disorder estimator @xmath128 increases with @xmath2 ( see supplementary fig .",
    "s7 ) , but also with @xmath33 ; which of these two parameters is best correlated with @xmath128 is not obvious .",
    "but it is noteworthy that the crowd at @xmath35 has a larger @xmath128 value than that at @xmath36 , which points to the enhancement of disorder due to behavioural heterogeneity .    besides disorder ,",
    "another practically relevant feature of the evacuation is the pressure exerted applied on the participants , insofar as suffocation and compressive asphyxia , originating in the compression of the lungs , have been reported as a cause of death in major crowd disasters @xcite .",
    "accordingly , after each experiment , we asked a dozen randomly picked participants to rate the level of mechanical pressure that they experienced during the evacuation from 1 to 10 , for want of more objective measurements of pressure .",
    "the perceived pressure follows a clear trend , more precisely , a monotonic increase with the density @xmath2 in the exit zone ( and thus also with @xmath33 ) , as shown in supplementary fig .",
    "s8 ) . therefore ,",
    "competitive evacuations , associated with larger densities at the door , involve more disorder and higher pressure than their more cooperative counterparts .",
    "the most competitive ones even feature signs of incipient turbulence , in the form of `` vortices '' at the exit , i.e. , participants spinning around a full 360@xmath132 when egressing ( see table  [ tab : global ] and videos in the supplemental materials ) .",
    "in summary , we have performed evacuation experiments through a 72-cm - wide door , in which a ( variable ) fraction @xmath33 of the participants were asked to behave selfishly , while the rest behaved politely . irrespective of these behaviours , a first series of experiments was conducted with placid walkers and a second one with purposeful walkers . by re - injecting",
    "egressing participants into the room , we managed to improve the statistics . furthermore , despite instantaneous fluctuations , the pedestrian flow was found to be quasi - stationary at the macroscopic scale , unlike in other experiments @xcite .",
    "the flow rate @xmath1 gets higher for larger @xmath33 and with more purposeful walkers .",
    "the absence of a ` faster - is - slower ' effect does not contradict its possible occurrence effect@xcite when considering crowds above a competitiveness threshold .",
    "irrespective of the behaviours , the flow rate and other flow properties such as the disorder in the passages and the pressure perceived by the participants exhibit a simple dependence on the density @xmath2 in the exit zone .",
    "thus , our results suggest that in a coarse macroscopic approach , and for a given composition of the crowd , the behavioural aspects can be left aside in favour of the density @xmath2 ; this confirms the key role played by the latter in determining the flow rate @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , @xmath1 was observed to grow monotonically with @xmath2 up to close - packing ( @xmath3 ) , contrary to most fundamental diagrams in the literature @xcite .",
    "in fact , we believe that at high densities the global flow rate will strongly depend on other parameters , in particular , the pressure in the crowd , thus , to what extent people are pushing their neighbours . here , the participants were not allowed to push . yet",
    ", the evacuation dynamics clearly became more disorderly with increasing @xmath33 and increasing purposefulness .",
    "this disorder was notably reflected in the distribution @xmath81 of time lapses @xmath83 between successive escapes : @xmath81 displays a relatively sharp peak at @xmath133 of order @xmath134 for polite crowds . in more competitive evacuations the low-@xmath83 region",
    "gets populated ; bursts of quasi - simultaneous escapes occur and seem to be exponentially distributed in size . in the most competitive evacuations , some signs of incipient flow turbulence",
    "were even detected , e.g. , pedestrian `` vortices '' .",
    "shorter and longer time lapses @xmath83 were found to alternate between successive escapes in almost all experiments .",
    "we explained this in terms of a generalised zipper effect , whereby pedestrians strive to keep a finite headway behind an agent walking in the same direction , while coming close to contact with those from another direction .",
    "this idea is supported by the marked anti - correlations in the angles of incidence at the door .    finally , we investigated the pedestrians dwell time @xmath117 in the exit zone .",
    "the mean dwell time clearly increases with the occupancy of the zone , especially for selfish agents .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath117 is shorter and more narrowly distributed for selfish agents . also , polite pedestrians coming from the sides display more outliers at large @xmath117 .    several of the effects observed in our `` microscopic '' study of the evacuation dynamics are rather intuitive .",
    "but their quantitative characterisation opens the door ( so to speak ) to more thorough tests of evacuation models in constrained settings , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and , accordingly , more precise understanding of the process .",
    "our study may also prompt the idea that the effect of the pedestrians behaviours on the evacuation dynamics is amenable to a simple description .",
