    "this trend is evident in the cet@xmath2x@xmath3 systems , for which the expected lattice constant value due to the ln@xmath7 lattice contraction at room temperature is strongly depressed for the phosphides , is not depressed at all for the antimonides , and is intermediate for the arsenides.@xcite the affects of hybridization are particularly dramatic for ceru@xmath2sb@xmath3 which , until now , was the only filled skutterudite known to show non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior.@xcite in this compound , the nfl behavior is characterized at low t as follows : resistivity - @xmath0(t ) @xmath4 t@xmath5 , specific heat divided by temperature - c(t)/t @xmath4 -lnt or t@xmath8 , and magnetic susceptibility - @xmath1(t ) @xmath4 t@xmath9 , all of which suggest that ceru@xmath2sb@xmath3 is located near a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the value of the lattice constant for ceru@xmath2sb@xmath3 at room temperature indicates that the ce ions are nearly trivalent , suggesting a kondo lattice is the appropriate description of the physics .",
    "however , it should be noted that the unusual evolution of @xmath1(t ) with t signals a more complicated scenario where the ce ions may undergo a continuous valence transition from 3@xmath6 towards 4@xmath6 with decreasing t.    in this paper , we report nfl behavior in the filled skutterudite ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 , indicating that this compound is also near a qcp . however , in this case , the lattice constant at room temperature and the t dependence of @xmath1(t ) reveal that the ce ions have an intermediate valence between 3@xmath10 and 4@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 is one of only a few compounds where the appropriate description of the nfl behavior may be a valence fluctuation rather than a kondo lattice picture .",
    "we present measurements of @xmath0(t ) , c(t ) , @xmath1(t ) , and thermoelectric power s(t ) for the compound ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 , characterize the nfl behavior , discuss the evidence for intermediate valence on the ce ions , and compare to other ce based systems where the nfl behavior may be related to intermediate ce valence .",

    "the decrease of @xmath1(t ) with decreasing t from @xmath4 300 k down to @xmath4 90 k is consistent with the ce ions having an intermediate valence between 3@xmath10 and 4@xmath10 . in this picture",

    "however , for an intermediate valence state involving a temporal admixture of the 4f@xmath33 and 4f@xmath34 configurations , @xmath1(t ) is expected to be intermediate between @xmath1(t ) of the ce@xmath7 and ce@xmath31 integral valence states for t @xmath40 t@xmath38 and to exhibit an enhanced pauli - like susceptibility for t @xmath41 t@xmath38 .",

    "the upturn in @xmath1(t ) can be described by various functions at low temperatures , including a curie law for 1.9 k @xmath16 t @xmath16 5 k of the form ,    @xmath43    where @xmath1@xmath29 @xmath19 1.5@xmath1310@xmath44 cm@xmath18/mol and c @xmath19",

    "another possibility is that the low temperature curie - like upturn is due to other magnetic rare earth impurities such as gd@xmath7 . from the value of the curie constant obtained above , impurity concentrations equivalent to @xmath4 1500 ppm ce@xmath7 or @xmath4 500 ppm",
    "gd@xmath7 could account for the curie contribution to @xmath1(t ) .",
    "these concentrations seem rather large for paramagnetic impurities , and therefore suggest that the low temperature behavior is intrinsic to ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 .",

    "the unusual behavior seen in s(t ) below 5 k also supports the viewpoint that t@xmath29 is in this temperature range .    a comparison to typical heavy fermion systems may also be made by computing an effective wilson - sommerfield ratio r@xmath87 @xmath19 ( @xmath88@xmath54k@xmath54@xmath37/3@xmath89@xmath54@xmath90)(@xmath1@xmath29/@xmath56 ) . since unambiguous choices for @xmath1@xmath29 and @xmath56",

    "this value is similar to those found in f - electron materials that exhibit fermi liquid behavior with heavy quasiparticles .",
    "however , the relationship between @xmath1@xmath29 and @xmath56 in an nfl system remains unclear .",
    "in addition to nfl behavior , ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 appears to be characterized by ce ions with a valence intermediate between 3@xmath6 and 4@xmath6 .",
    "this observation is first suggested by the depressed room temperature lattice constant , as compared to the expected trivalent lanthanide contraction ( lc ) value for the mru@xmath2as@xmath3 series where m = la - pr.@xcite to emphasize this point , a comparison can be made to the related compounds mt@xmath2sb@xmath3 and mt@xmath2p@xmath3 where m = la - nd and t = fe , ru , and os . for mt@xmath2sb@xmath3 , there is no deviation from the expected lc value at room temperature and , therefore , the ce ions appear to have a valence near 3@xmath6 , although this does not preclude the possibility of an intermediate valence state below room temperature .",
    "this viewpoint is supported by xanes measurements of cefe@xmath2sb@xmath3 and ceos@xmath2sb@xmath3 where ce is shown to be in the trivalent state at room temperature.@xcite in contrast , mt@xmath2p@xmath3 compounds follow a lc except in the case m = ce where the lattice constant is severely depressed from the expected value . in this case , xanes measurements show that the ce ions in cet@xmath2p@xmath3 ( t = fe , ru ) are mainly 3@xmath6 with a small 4@xmath6 contribution at room temperature.@xcite it should be noted that xanes measurements of ce compounds may underestimate the 4@xmath6 compared to the 3@xmath6 component of the ce valence.@xcite since the lattice constant suppressions for the cet@xmath2as@xmath3 compounds are between that for the cet@xmath2sb@xmath3 and cet@xmath2p@xmath3 systems , it is likely that the valence of their ce ions are likewise intermediate .",
    "the intermediate valence picture is further supported by the unusual t - dependence of @xmath1(t ) for ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 which is similar to that seen for other intermediate valence compounds such as sms , smb@xmath91 , or la@xmath72th@xmath71 doped with ce impurities where the ce valence evolves from 3@xmath6 to an intermediate value as a function of th concentration.@xcite moreover , by comparison to ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 , it appears that ceru@xmath2sb@xmath3 may also develop an intermediate valence state below room temperature.@xcite although it appears that the ce ions in ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 have valence between 3@xmath6 and 4@xmath6 , additional characterization such as xanes measurements are required to verify this hypothesis .",
    "it should also be noted that a kondo volume collapse scenario could , in principle , account for the reduced lattice constant.@xcite    in typical discussions of nfl physics in f - electron materials , the phenomena are described in terms of interactions between the itinerant electrons and the magnetic rare earth ions .",
    "examples include ; ( 1 ) nearness to various types of magnetic quantum critical points where a second - order phase transition is suppressed to 0 k and quantum fluctuations govern physical properties , @xcite ( 2 ) kondo disorder where a range of kondo temperatures are allowed including t@xmath92 @xmath19 0 k , @xcite ( 3 ) the griffiths phase model , @xcite and ( 4 ) the quadrupolar kondo model.@xcite these pictures have been moderately successful in describing numerous nfl systems .",

    "@xcite the transition from a weakly insulating state for polycrystalline samples to semimetallic nfl behavior for single crystal samples further signals that ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 is near a qcp and that its physical properties are tuned by some parameter , such as ce filling or structural disorder , that is affected by sample growth technique or degree of crystallinity .",
    "a similar situation is seen for cerhsb@xmath72sn@xmath71 , where cerhsb is a kondo semiconductor and cerhsn exhibits nfl behavior.@xcite in this system , it is possible to tune through a kondo insulator - nfl quantum critical point as a function of dopant x. this situation may be analogous to the polycrystalline - single crystal ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 weak insulator - nfl evolution where the tuning parameter is defect site or ce concentration .",
    "it has been shown that measurements of @xmath0(t ) , @xmath1(t ) , c(t)/t , and s(t ) for single crystals of ceru@xmath2as@xmath3 conform to nfl phenomena at low temperatures . moreover",
