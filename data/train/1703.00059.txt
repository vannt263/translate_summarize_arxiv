    "a theorem of e. cartan ( @xcite , iv 3.2 and ii 2.6 ) states that the isometry group of a real symmetric space has a canonical structure of a lie group . over a non - archimedean field , the only known analogs of symmetric spaces are the drinfeld symmetric spaces and their products",
    ". in analogy to bounded symmetric domains , products of drinfeld spaces provide non - archimedean uniformization for shimura varieties , as shown by varshavsky and rapoport - zink ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine the group of analytic automorphisms of such a product .",
    "we let @xmath1 be a non - archimedean local field , @xmath2 a non - archimedean field containing @xmath1 , and @xmath3 finite extensions of @xmath1 , which are contained in @xmath2 .",
    "we will consider the @xmath2-analytic space ( in the sense of berkovich , see @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the drinfeld space of dimension @xmath7 over @xmath8 , defined as the open subset of the projective space @xmath9 obtained by removing all the @xmath8-rational hyperplanes .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following theorem :    [ t ] let @xmath10 be the permutation group @xmath11 .",
    "then we have @xmath12    the case @xmath13 of theorem [ t ] was proved in @xcite and also in @xcite in the zero characteristic case .",
    "the proof in @xcite and its extension here to the case of a product demonstrate the power and usefulness of berkovich spaces .",
    "for example , there is a natural , @xmath14-equivariant surjective map from the drinfeld symmetric space @xmath15 to the bruhat - tits building of @xmath16 .",
    "this well known map exists in the rigid analytic sense as well .",
    "but in the framework of berkovich spaces , this map has a right inverse : the building is naturally embedded in the symmetric space .",
    "the points of the building ( which is a euclidean object ) inside the @xmath0-adic symmetric space do not exist in the rigid analytic sense , but exist in the berkovich sense .",
    "this property is extremely helpful in finding the automorphism group of the symmetric space .",
    "let us overview the proof of theorem [ t ] , and start by recalling the strategy of the proof for the case @xmath13 , in @xcite : given an automorphism @xmath17 of @xmath18 , it is shown that the bruhat - tits building @xmath19 of @xmath16 ( viewed as a subset of @xmath20 ) is preserved by @xmath17 , and moreover , that @xmath17 induces a simplicial autopmorphism of @xmath19 . then",
    ", @xmath17 is composed with an element @xmath21 of @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 fixes an apartment @xmath24 of @xmath19 pointwise .",
    "it is then shown that @xmath20 can be projected onto @xmath24 , and that @xmath25 commutes with this projection , hence @xmath25 preserves the fibers of the projection .",
    "this , together with a lemma on bounded holomorphic functions on @xmath20 , enables to determine the automorphism @xmath17 .",
    "let us remark that there is a gap in the above proof .",
    "there are simplicial automorphisms of @xmath19 whose composition with any element @xmath26 does not fix any chamber @xmath19 pointwise ( see section [ labelling ] ) . hence , we can not assume that @xmath17 fixes an apartment pointwise . in the proof presented here , we will overcome this problem by indroducing a labelling on the vertices of @xmath19 and showing that an automorphism of @xmath19 is either _ label preserving _ , in which case its restriction to an apartment is induced by an element of @xmath26 , or _ label reversing _ , in which case it can be composed with a certain involution of @xmath19 which we construct , and then it is made label preserving .",
    "then , at the last stage of the proof we will show that in fact the second possibility can not occur .",
    "let us now describe our proof strategy in the case where @xmath27 and all the fields @xmath28 are equal .",
    "we embed the product of the corresponding bruhat - tits buildings ( which we still call @xmath19 ) in our space .",
    "we show , as before , that @xmath17 preserves @xmath19 and analyze the action of @xmath17 on a chamber of @xmath19 .",
    "a key ingredient in this analysis is the labelling of the building , and a counting argument which determines its interaction with @xmath17 . from this analysis",
    "it follows that after a permutation on the coordinates , and composing with the above involutions in some of the coordinates , an apartment is fixed pointwise",
    ". then , as before , we prove that @xmath17 acts on the fibers of the projection to the apartment .",
    "in the general case , the fields @xmath28 may not all be equal , and therefore we are not allowed to permute coodinates with different fields .",
    "we remedy this by embedding our building in a larger building , in which these permutations are allowed .    as a result of our main theorem",
    ", we prove the following rigidity theorem for quotients of such products by groups of automorphisms :    [ r ] if @xmath29 are finite extensions of @xmath1 which are contained in @xmath2 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are discrete and torsion free subgroups of @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , such that the quotients @xmath34 and @xmath35 are isomorphic as @xmath2-analytic spaces , then @xmath36 , and there exists a permutation @xmath37 such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , and @xmath30 and @xmath41 are conjugate in @xmath42 .",

    "2 .   similarly to the previous item , we can replace the infinite set of conditions in the definition of @xmath80 by a finite one .",

    "4 .   this follows immediately from the previous two claims .",
    "it follows from proposition [ open ] that the above description of the drinfeld space is compatible with its description elsewhere in the literature .",
    "in fact , under the fully faithful functor from hausdorff strictly @xmath2-analytic berkovich spaces to quasiseparated rigid analytic spaces ( ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.6.1 ) ) , the space @xmath66 corresponds to the rigid analytic drinfeld space as defined in @xcite , since the covering by @xmath80 maps to the admissible affinoid covering defined in @xcite .",
    "hence , the calculation here of the automorphism group is valid in the rigid analytic sense , and the same is true for products of such spaces",
    ".    finally , let us note that the group @xmath114 acts on @xmath106 by analytic automorphisms , and since we removed all the @xmath8-rational hyperplanes , this induces such an action of @xmath26 on @xmath66 .",
    "in this section we recall some definitions and facts on the bruhat - tits building of @xmath16 and its relation to the drinfeld space .",
    "more details and proofs can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will use the terminology introduced in @xcite , i.1 , regarding simplicial and polysimplicial complexes . let us recall it briefly . a polysimplicial",
    "complex is a set @xmath115 , together with a family @xmath116 of subsets of @xmath115 ( called faces ) , a partial ordering on @xmath116 and an affine structure on @xmath117 for any @xmath118 , such that :    1 .   the sets of @xmath116 form a partition of @xmath115 .",
    "2 .   for any @xmath119 , @xmath120 is a closed polysimplex ( i.e a finite product of simplices ) , in a compatible way with the affine structure and order relation .",
    "we call each @xmath120 a _ closed face_. 3",
    ".   the dimensions of the faces are bounded .",
    "we call a closed face of maximum dimension a _ chamber _ and a closed face of codimension @xmath121 a _ facet_. 4 .",
    "any two faces are connected by a sequence of chambers , such that consecutive terms intersect in a facet .",
    "such a sequence is called a _",
    "gallery_.    we order the closed faces by inclusion .",
    "the closed faces are in order preserving bijection with the faces , since @xmath122 .",
    "a polysimplicial complex has a topology , which is the gluing of the euclidean topologies on the closed faces along the inclusion maps .",
    "a morphism of polysimplicial complexes is a map of the underlying sets , carrying faces to faces , and preserving the affine structure .",
    "we call such a morphism _ chambered _ if , in addition , it carries chambers to chambers isomorphically .",

    "vertex _ , and a @xmath121-dimensional closed face an _",
    "edge_. a polysimplicial complex is called a simplicial complex if all its closed faces are simplices .",

    "it has two well known descriptions : a combinatorial one , in which the vertices are given in terms of lattices , and a euclidean one , in which the points are given in terms of norms .",
    "let us start with the combinatorial one .",

    "two norms @xmath143 on @xmath124 are called homothetic if @xmath144 for some constant @xmath145 .",
    "then the underlying set of @xmath127 ( which we denote by the same notation ) is the set of norms on @xmath124 modulo homothety .    for any basis @xmath146 of @xmath124 , let @xmath147 be the set of homothety classes of norms of the form    @xmath148    for some positive reals @xmath149 .",
