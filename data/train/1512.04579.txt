    "since the beginning of differential calculus , the question of what could be a derivative of non - integer order was pertinent and leibniz himself wondered about the derivative of order @xmath0 .",
    "liouville carried out a serious investigation on the subject , and presented a notion of fractional integrator operator .",
    "later , starting with cauchy s formula for an @xmath1-fold integral , riemann defined a fractional integration as it is known today , and become a basis for the fractional calculus theory . a different type of fractional operators have appeared in 1967 @xcite , due to michel caputo , and as proven to be applicable in many situations .",
    "it reveals two advantages : the derivative of a constant is zero and , when solving fractional differential equations involving this operator , it is not necessary to define fractional order initial conditions and we may consider ordinary ones . in the last years , fdes have revealed to model better some real phenomena , since these fractional operators contain memory and from experimental data , some dynamics of trajectories are modeled by non - integer order derivatives . because of this , they have found numerous applications in various research areas and engineering applications ( viscoelasticity , viscoplasticity , modeling polymers , transmission of ultrasound waves , etc ) @xcite . however , there is no effective and easy - to - use method to solve such differential equations .",
    "for this reason , we find in the literature a vast number of numerical methods in order to be able to solve them @xcite .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : fc ] with a short introduction to fractional calculus , as presented in e.g. @xcite . in section [ sec : theory ] , we present and prove the main result of the paper : under some smoothness assumptions , we can approximate a fractional derivative of arbitrary real order by a sum that involves integer - order derivatives only .",
    "an estimation for the error is also given .",
    "with this , we extend the main results of @xcite , by considering fractional derivatives of arbitrary real order . in section [ sec : examples ] , we present some examples ; first we test the efficiency of the method , by comparing the exact expression of the caputo fractional derivative of a given function with some numerical approximations . at the end , we exemplify how it can be useful to solve fractional differential equations .",
    "let us review some necessary definitions on fractional calculus .",
