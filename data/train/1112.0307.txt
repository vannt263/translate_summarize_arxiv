    "we argue that the general protocol in sec .  6 of that paper can be adapted to a fast protocol for implementing bipartite unitaries with similar entanglement cost .    in an instantaneous measurement protocol ,",
    "each of the two parties performs a local measurement on his / her input system and part of the shared entangled state , and possibly some local ancillary system , and then they both send the measurement outcomes via classical channels to a third party , who calculates the final outcome of the nonlocal measurement from the classical input he receives .",
    "it is not known if every instantaneous measurement protocol can be adapted to a fast nonlocal unitary protocol .",

    "alice teleports the @xmath283 subsystem to bob , and at the same time bob teleports the @xmath284 subsystem to alice .",
    "several steps after the teleportations are not shown in the figure : the parties communicate classically and find out where the actual output system is , and do local unitary corrections , then swap the respective part of output system to a fixed location.,width=9 ]    however , the general instantaneous measurement protocol in sec .  6 of @xcite can indeed be adapted to a fast unitary protocol .",
    "their protocol essentially does the following : first , perform a unitary ( we will call it the _ target _ unitary , since it is the unitary to be implemented in our adapted protocol ) on the combined input system of alice and bob , with its output possessed by one of the parties only ; and then alice and bob each does local measurements , and they send the measurement outcomes by classical means simultaneously to the other party . each party would have obtained enough information to figure out where the output of the target unitary was , and find out the outcome of the measurement on the output of that unitary , which is the outcome of their instantaneous measurement .",
    "our method of adapting the protocol is : remove the final measurement in the original protocol , and at the time when the `` target '' unitary is just implemented in the original protocol , do extra teleportations to distribute to each party one of the two subsystems of the output of the `` target unitary '' .",
    "these extra teleportations will be called `` delocalizing teleportations '' .",
    "the details of this adapting process are discussed in the two paragraphs below .",
    "we first describe the method for the simpler case of a single pauli rotation chain , where a pauli rotation chain is a sequence of local operations in the protocol in @xcite which applies a pauli rotation @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is a pauli string operator ( tensor product of pauli operators on qubits ) , and @xmath287 is a real number",
    ". if the target unitary is on two qubits , then it will be implementable by a single pauli rotation chain if and only if the unitary is of the form @xmath288 up to local unitaries , i.e. when it is of schmidt rank 2 .",
    "as illustrated in fig  [ fgr4 ] , the output state of the `` target unitary '' is located in the @xmath281 system or @xmath282 system , and our method requires that alice teleports @xmath283 to bob while bob teleports @xmath284 to alice , just before doing the final measurement in the original protocol .",
    "note that only one of the teleportations in the two directions will be actually sending the target state , because the target state will only be in the party that terminates `` earlier '' than the other party ( `` earlier '' is in the sense of the flow diagrams in @xcite ) , but neither party knows if the other party had terminated and hence needs to act as if the target state is in his / her own hands .",
    "then each party sends all the measurement outcomes ( from all steps of the protocol so far ) to the other party , and upon receipt of the classical messages each party figures out where the output system is .",
    "without loss of generality , assume alice terminated first .",
    "( for the case that bob terminated first , the local subsystems on which the following operations are carried out will be different , hence our method is safe but a bit costly : alice and bob would need to do the operations corresponding to both cases . ) by now the output system is already distributed to alice and bob , but still lacks two final local corrections , the _ first _ one is only on bob s side corresponding to alice s measurement outcomes in the last teleportation step we added , and the _ second _ one involves both parties and corresponds to the outcomes of bob s last measurement ( as a step of the original protocol ) .",
    "then alice and bob do these local unitary corrections , with the `` first '' correction being done first , since it corresponds to a later measurement .",
    "note that for the `` second '' local corrections to be local , the last measurement by bob should be as if he were teleporting the two subsystems ( belonging to alice and bob at the end ) individually , and this is indeed the way in @xcite that teleportation is done  individually on each qubit .",
    "of course , no final measurement on the output state is needed in our adapted protocol . in order for the output system to be at some fixed location no matter what the intermediate measurement outcomes are",
    ", a last step of the whole adapted protocol is that each of the two parties swaps his / her own part of the output system into a `` blank '' system at some fixed location .",
    "now let us discuss the more general case that more than one pauli rotation chain is used in the instantaneous measurement protocol .",
    "the pauli rotation chains are arranged in different levels , and each chain at a certain level is linked to many different chains in the next level . as a result , the final output state may be in many different places on the different chains on the final level .",
    "now the final delocalizing teleportations must be performed on all the final - level pauli - rotation chains , because each party can not be sure on which of these chains the true output state is located , as the location generally depends on the other party s measurement results at various stages of the protocol .",
    "for each final - level chain , the added teleportation on each party need only be performed once , which is the same as in the single - chain case .",
    "the final steps are also similar as before : each party sends all measurement outcomes to the other party and figures out where the actual output state is , and does the appropriate local corrections , and swaps the respective part of the output system to a fixed location .",
    "the extra entanglement cost resulting from the extra steps described above can be calculated as follows .",
    "suppose the target unitary acts on a @xmath289 space , then the part of the output system that needs to be teleported from alice to bob is of dimension @xmath14 , and the part that needs to be teleported from bob to alice is of dimension @xmath10 , and the last local swaps do not need entanglement , hence the extra entanglement cost is @xmath290 ebits times the number of final - level pauli rotation chains of alice , plus @xmath291 ebits times the number of final - level pauli rotation chains of bob .",
    "this quantity is not greater than the entanglement cost of the earlier parts of the protocol , hence the scaling behavior of the entanglement cost is the same as that of the instantaneous measurement protocol .",
    "now we compare the entanglement cost of the fast unitary protocols in ( or adapted from ) @xcite , and our protocols in this paper , for implementing bipartite controlled unitaries .",
    "it should be noted that our protocols in this paper are specifically designed for controlled unitaries , while these other protocols are for general unitaries , but we apply them in the restricted case of controlled unitaries , and we will discuss the actual entanglement cost of these protocols for controlled unitaries , which is smaller than the cost for general unitaries for some of these protocols .",
    "another point worth mentioning , since it will not be mentioned in the comparison of asymptotic entanglement cost in the following paragraphs , is that our controlled - group protocol performs well when the controlled operators form a representation of a small group .",
