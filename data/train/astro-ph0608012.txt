    "elliptical galaxies located in very low density environments are highly uncommon but hold important clues about galaxy formation and evolution . for example",
    ", current hierarchical models for galaxy formation predict that ellipticals in low density environments have stellar populations which are younger by 1 - 2  gyr than their cluster counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this framework ,",
    "isolated ellipticals are thought to be formed in mergers of galaxy pairs or small groups of galaxies @xcite . in the first case",
    ", the mergers will give rise to kinematical misalignments whilst , in the second , they will produce an increasing amplitude of rotation with galactocentric radius , and also rotation around the minor axis @xcite .",
    "detailed studies involving morphology , kinematics and/or stellar populations of isolated ellipticals have been restricted to nearby galaxies ( c@xmath2@xmath310000 km s@xmath4 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we perform an exhaustive analysis of cgcg 480 - 022 ( c@xmath2=14317 km s@xmath4 ) , which includes morphological , kinematical , stellar population and n - body simulation properties .",
    "we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that this galaxy suffered a major merger event .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with h@xmath5=71 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath6=0.3 and @xmath7=0.7 .",
    "optical and near - ir images were extracted from the dss and 2mass catalogues , respectively .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained with the dolores spectrograph on the 3.5 m tng telescope at la palma ( spain ) on october 3 , 2005 .",
    "we used the medium - resolution mr - b#2 grism , in the wavelength range @xmath83500 - 7000   , and a 1.1@xmath9@xmath1050@xmath9 slit .",
    "the dispersion was 1.7   / pix with an instrumental resolution of 8   ( fwhm ) .",
    "we obtained 10@xmath1030 minute exposures , interspersed with he+ar arc - lamp spectra , flux and radial velocity standards in the same instrumental setup .",
    "the seeing was 1.1@xmath9 .",
    "data reduction was performed using standard iraf packages .",
    "once wavelength and flux calibrated , the spectra were extracted in the spatial direction coadding 4 pixels to reach the seeing size , or more if necessary to reach s / n@xmath1130 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "following this procedure , we obtained 13 bins out to @xmath12=@xmath130.8  r@xmath14 .",
    "to determine morphological and photometric parameters we used the code described in @xcite on k - band and optical images .",
    "table [ table1 ] presents , for each morphological parameter , the average value obtained from both bands .",
    "figure [ morfologia]a shows the k - band image while figure [ morfologia]b shows the optical image with the spectrograph slit overplotted . according to our morphological parameters , and its optical appearance , cgcg 480 - 022 seems to be a typical elliptical galaxy .",
    "however , when inspecting the k - band image , we detect possible tidal tails or ring debris . in order to search for the existence of more subestructures , we performed a 2d fit of the galaxy using galfit @xcite with those parameters listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "figures [ morfologia]c and [ morfologia]d show the residuals obtained when subtracting 2d models from each image in k - band and optical , respectively . in both cases",
    "we clearly observe a well - defined ring at @xmath12@xmath155  @xmath16 , yielding to a rippled structure similar to the shells found in other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "residuals in k - band are compatible with b - r color contours overplotted on figure [ morfologia]c .",
    "the radial velocity for each bin was determined by cross - correlating the observed spectrum with a set of representative synthetic single stellar population spectra , from the model of @xcite .",
    "this method is described in @xcite , following the paper of @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath17 values are represented versus radius in figure [ dinamica]a .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath17 decreases with galactocentric distance at both sides of the centre , out of @xmath18 at @xmath12@xmath153  @xmath16 .",
    "we also see a relative increase of @xmath19 where the ring is located .",
    "note that the plotted region represents 0.8@xmath20 .    to measure the velocity dispersion , @xmath21",
    ", we followed the method described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ dinamica]b shows @xmath21 vs. radius . we observe that , within the errors , regions outside the ring present an almost constant @xmath21@xmath15400  km  s@xmath4 while the inner parts look more ordered , i.e. @xmath21 decreases , reaching @xmath18 in the centre .",
    "a similar profile has been found for the isolated massive galaxy ngc 1700 @xcite .      to aid our understanding of these results",
    "we have performed n - body simulations .",
    "our numerical models simulated a merger between two elliptical galaxies with a mass ratio of 10:1 and 5:1 , and the fly - by of a dwarf galaxy about a massive elliptical .",
    "as initial conditions for our experiments we used : _",
    "i ) _ isotropic spherical @xcite models for the elliptical galaxies , and _",
    "ii ) _ a @xcite model for the dwarf galaxy , with a halo modeled with an evans model . see @xcite for further details of this model and initial conditions for the elliptical galaxies , and @xcite for the dwarf galaxy model .",
    "we used the tree - code gadget1.1 @xcite employing 10@xmath22 particles for each model .",
    "low mass jaffe models are scaled down homologous systems as the model with mass 1 and with 10 or 5 times fewer particles .",
    "parabolic grazing orbits are employed for the merger simulations while a hyperbolic encounter is used for the fly - by experiment .",
    "energy was well conserved , with errors well below 0.1% .",
    "the material originally belonging to the small galaxy in the 5:1 merger finally lies on a fat disk - like distribution , while that of the 10:1 merger produces a torus - like body . the fly - by encounter produces shells and ripples in the inner parts of the giant galaxy from particles belonging to the satellite ; however no ring or disk is produced in this encounter .",
    "we have obtained a broad estimate of the mass ratio between our target galaxy and a possible companion .",
    "if we consider the merger as an inelastic collision , then the whole kinetic energy of the satellite will be transformed into ` thermal ' energy of the stars of the main galaxy .",
    "this process will create a velocity dispersion , @xmath21 , given by @xmath23=@xmath24@xmath25@xmath26=@xmath27 , where v@xmath28 is the relative velocity of the satellite with respect to the main galaxy , and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) the mass of the central ( satellite ) galaxy . considering that they are field galaxies , the proper motion should be of the order of @xmath31@xmath1510@xmath32  km  s@xmath4 , while @xmath21@xmath15300  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "then , we find @xmath26@xmath1510 . moreover , of the models explored , the e+e 10:1 merger is the one with properties closer to those reported for cgcg 480 - 022 .",
    "figure [ nbody ] presents the particle distribution of the 10:1 system .",
    "a ring is clearly observable at a galactocentric distance comparable to that detected in cgcg 480 - 022 .",
    "the global kinematics as seen from the same point of view are given in figure [ nbody ] .",
    "the velocity curve presents a drop as we move to larger radii , in agreement with the observations , but the velocity dispersion presents a general declining profile , contrary to what is observed .",
    "the stellar population analysis was performed following the prescriptions described in @xcite . to derive mean",
    "luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities , we compared selected absorption line strengths with those predicted by the model of @xcite .",
    "this model provides flux - calibrated spectra in the optical range at a resolution of 1.8    ( fwhm ) for single - burst stellar populations .",
    "this way , we can transform synthetic spectra to the resolution and dispersion of the galaxy spectrum .",
    "plots of the strengths of selected indices ( mg@xmath33 and fe4383 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) versus h@xmath34 provide close to orthogonal model grids , allowing an accurate estimation of galaxy mean age and abundances of the different elements .",
    "we have determined mean ages and relative abundances [ mg / h ] and [ fe / h ] at each galactocentric distance , computing their radial gradients .",
    "figure [ poblaciones ] presents the ages and abundances for each element with respect to the central values , versus the radial distance .",
    "if we exclude those regions within 3@xmath3@xmath35@xmath36  @xmath16 , we observe clear gradients for both ages and abundances , with the age increasing towards outer regions and abundances decreasing throughout the galactic radius .",
    "this result is in agreement with several studies involving gradients in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    when considering the region 3@xmath3@xmath35@xmath36  @xmath16 , where the ring is located , we observe a decrease in age with respect to the surrounding regions , associated with a bump in metallicity .",
    "this suggests the occurrence of a star formation burst coupled with the presence of the ring .",
    "the morphological , kinematical , n - body simulations and stellar population analysis all suggest that cgcg 480 - 022 could have experienced a major merger event with an alleged companion . in this section",
    ", we will focus on the evidences provided by each approach .",
    "_ morphology_. the residuals obtained when substracting a 2d model from the images show , in all bands , the presence of a ring of @xmath12@xmath155  @xmath16 .",
    "this ring , together with outer streams of material appearing in k - band images , could trace the propagating sound - waves produced by a merger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) more likely than by the action of tidal interactions or asymmetric star formation @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that morphological peculiarities , such as shells or ripples , occur roughly 5 times more frequently in environments outside of rich clusters .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite who concluded that shells are much more prevalent in isolated galaxies than in group galaxies .",
    "note that the rosat x - ray image of the galaxy @xcite shows two symmetric lobes in the n - s direction .",
    "_ kinematics_. the most intriguing of our results concerns the kinematics of the galaxy .",
    "first , within the errors , we find a constant @xmath21@xmath15400  km  s@xmath4 which decreases in the interior of the ring . a similar pattern has been found in other isolated massive galaxy ( ngc1700 ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , such high @xmath21 does not correspond to a virialized system but , in a merger scenario , the intrinsic velocity dispersion should be affected by the collision , yielding higher values of @xmath21 .",
    "second , the radial velocity curve looks symmetrical .",
    "furthermore , both @xmath21 and @xmath17 values bump at the position where the ring is located , i.e. 3@xmath3@xmath35@xmath36  @xmath16 . as an additional test",
    ", we checked whether cgcg 480 - 022 follows or not the fundamental plane ( fp ; * ? ? ? * ) and the faber - jackson @xcite , the kormendy @xcite and the mg@xmath33-@xmath21 @xcite relations .",
    "we considered these relations in the near - ir , with data taken from @xcite .",
    "cgcg 480 - 022 deviates @xmath36 from the fp , @xmath37 from the faber - jackson relation and @xmath38 from the mg@xmath33-@xmath21 relation ; but just @xmath39 from the kormendy relation .",
    "our galaxy is an outlier in those relations involving the velocity dispersion , in the sense that it _ should _ be lower _ if _ it corresponds to the intrinsic velocity dispersion of a virialized system .",
    "thus , a major event affecting the dynamics of this galaxy must have occurred .",
    "a similar explanation could be proposed for the @xmath17 curve , which does _ not _ correspond to a rotating system . in order to disentangle the kinematical peculiarities found in this galaxy ,",
    "future 2d - spectroscopy will be extremely helpful , specially to check if our derived kinematics depend on the slit direction .",
    "_ n - body simulations_. the n - body experiments performed suggest that a possible formation mechanism is a merger between two elliptical galaxies with a mass ratio near 10:1 , and meeting each other on a grazing orbit .",
    "in such an encounter the smaller system spirals inwards while the merger is proceeding finally into a torus - like structure .",
    "such torus as seen face - on resembles a ring and the kinematics imposed to the overall field would present a discontinuity .",
    "a significant success for this model is that it reproduces without fine tuning the velocity profile observed in cgcg 480 - 022 .",
    "the central zones moves with a larger velocity than the zones at increasing galactocentric distances , with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy , and there are secondary maxima at the radial location of the ring in both directions from the center .",
    "the range of values of the velocity dispersion predicted by the model is commensurate with that observed , but the decline in value as the center is approached is not reproduced .",
    "a reasonable explanation for this is that more ordered motion near the galaxy center could result from an inner disk within the ring radius .",
    "the present merger simulation has not , for simplicity , included the presence of gas , but merger models which do include gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a tendency for the gas to fall towards the center of the galaxy and form a disk .",
    "also , more detailed n - body+sph simulations including star formation and feedback processes will help to better understand the central kinematics of the system .    _",
    "stellar populations_. following our merger hypothesis , there should be a star formation burst in the ring due to the passing sound - wave .",
    "therefore , the stars in the ring should be younger and more metal - rich than those within inner regions , as we found . given that we know the geometry of the ring , we can broadly estimate the crossing time of the sound - wave through the position of the ring , under the following assumptions : _",
    "i ) _ the sound speed is constant throughout the whole system , and _",
    "ii ) _ the system behaves as an ideal gas .",
    "then , the mean pressure of a system of particles with a given velocity dispersion , @xmath21 , is @xmath40=@xmath41 .",
    "the propagation velocity of the perturbation corresponds to the sound speed , @xmath42 , as @xmath43=@xmath44=@xmath45@xmath25@xmath42@xmath15180  km  s@xmath4 . considering that the ring radius is @xmath155  @xmath16 , then the ellapsed time since the formation of the perturbation is @xmath46=4.8@xmath1010@xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the distance to the galaxy in km .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 should be the stellar age difference between the ring and the centre . given that @xmath48=6.2@xmath1010@xmath50  km , then @xmath49=5.3 gyr , which is in good agreement with our stellar population results ( see figure [ poblaciones ] ) .",
    "even though approximative , these numbers do support the merger hypothesis . +",
    "a question we would like to pose is why the most distant isolated elliptical galaxy so far studied in such detail looks so peculiar . to confirm the results presented here and probe the origin of this system",
    ", deep 2d spectroscopy is strongly needed .",
    "we also note that cgcg 480 - 022 is not a completely isolated galaxy but has one confirmed companion at a distance of 0.25  mpc : pgc 003298 @xcite .",
    "the dss image of this galaxy shows an elongated shape in the direction of cgcg 480 - 022 , whilst j- and k - band 2mass images present some tail - like structures . will pgc 003298 be the next to merge",
