    "this contribution is devoted to the issue of how a physical theory should be formulated in arbitrary spacetime backgrounds in such a way that the physical content is preserved .",
    "our motivation arises from various directions .",
    "first , it is essential for the extension of axiomatic quantum field theory to curved spacetimes .",
    "second , one would expect that any quantization of gravity coupled to matter should , in certain regimes , resemble a common theory of matter on different fixed backgrounds .",
    "third , as our universe appears to be well - described by a curved spacetime on many scales , one may well wonder what physical relevance should be ascribed to a theory that could only be formulated in minkowski space .    in lagrangian theories ,",
    "there is an apparently satisfactory answer to our question : namely that the lagrangian should transform covariantly under coordinate transformations .",
    "actually , even here there are subtleties , as a simple example reveals .",
    "consider the nonminimally coupled scalar field with lagrangian density @xmath1 in minkowski space the equation of motion does not depend on the coupling constant @xmath2 but theories with different coupling constant can still be distinguished by their stress - tensors , which contain terms proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "suppose , however , that @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a smooth function vanishing in a neighbourhood of the origin and taking a constant value @xmath6 for all sufficiently large @xmath7 .",
    "this gives a new theory that coincides with the @xmath8 theory in minkowski space in terms of the field equation , stress - energy tensor and any other quantity formed by functional differentiation of the action and then evaluated in minkowski space .",
    "but in de sitter space ( with sufficiently large cosmological constant ) the theory coincides , in the same sense , with the @xmath9 theory .",
    "of course , it is unlikely that a theory of this type would be physically relevant , but the example serves to illustrate that covariance of the lagrangian does not guarantee that the physical content of a theory will be the same in all spacetimes .",
    "additional conditions would be required ; perhaps that the ( undensitized ) lagrangian should depend analytically on the metric and curvature quantities .",
    "the situation is more acute when one attempts to generalize axiomatic quantum field theory to the curved spacetime context .",
    "after all , these approaches do not take a classical action as their starting point , but focus instead on properties that ought to hold for any reasonable quantum field theory . in minkowski",
    "space , poincar covariance and the existence of a unique invariant vacuum state obeying the spectrum condition provide strong constraints which ultimately account to a large part for the successes of axiomatic qft in both its wightman  grding  @xcite and araki  haag ",
    "kastler  @xcite formulations . as",
    "a generic spacetime has no symmetries , and moreover attempts to define distinguished vacuum states in general curved spacetimes lead to failure even for free fields , below strengthens this to a general no - go result .",
    "] there are severe difficulties associated with generalizing the axiomatic setting to curved spacetime .",
    "significant progress was made by brunetti , fredenhagen and verch @xcite ( henceforth bfv ) who formalized the idea of a locally covariant quantum field theory in the language of category theory ( see  @xcite as general references ) .",
    "as we will see , this paper opens up new ways to analyze physical theories ; in this sense it justifies its subtitle , ` a new paradigm for local quantum physics ' . at the structural level ,",
    "the ideas involved have led to a number of new model - independent results for qft in curved spacetime such as the spin - statistics connection  @xcite , reeh  schlieder type results  @xcite and the analysis superselection sectors  ; they were also crucial in completing the perturbative construction of interacting qft in curved spacetime .",
    "it should also be mentioned that antecedants of the ideas underlying the bfv formalism can be found in  @xcite",
    ". however , we stress that the bfv approach is not simply a matter of formalism : it suggests and facilitates new calculations that can lead to concrete physical predictions such as _ a priori _ bounds on casimir energy densities   and new viewpoints in cosmology  @xcite ( see also verch s contribution to these proceedings  @xcite ) .",
    "the focus in this paper is on the physical content of local covariance in the bfv formulation : in particular , is it sufficiently strong to enforce the same physics in all spacetimes ? and , if not , what does ?",
    "we confine ourselves here to the main ideas , referring to forthcoming papers  @xcite for the details .",
    "to begin , let us consider what is required for a local , causal description of physics",
    ". a minimal list might be the following :    * experiments can be conducted over a finite timespan and spatial extent in reasonable isolation from the rest of the world .",
    "* we may distinguish a ` before ' and an ` after ' for such experiments .",
    "* the ` same ' experiment could , in principle , be conducted at other locations and times with the ` same ' outcomes ( to within experimental accuracy , and possibly in a statistical sense ) . *",
    "the theoretical account of such experiments should be independent ( as far as possible ) of the rest of the world .",
    "stated simply , we should not need to know where in the universe our laboratory is , nor whether the universe has any extent much beyond its walls ( depending on the duration of the experiment and the degree of shielding the walls provide ) .",
    "of course , these statements contain a number of undefined terms ; and , when referring to the ` same ' experiment , we should take into account the motion of the apparatus relative to local inertial frames ( compare a foucault pendulum in regensburg ( latitude @xmath10n ) with one in york ( @xmath11n ) ) .",
    "anticipating machian objections to the last requirement , we assume that sufficient structures are present to permit identification of ( approximately ) inertial frames .",
    "if spacetime is modelled as a lorentzian manifold , the minimal requirements can be met by restricting to the globally hyperbolic spacetimes . recall that an orientable and time - orientable lorentzian manifold @xmath12 ( the symbol @xmath12 will encompass the manifold , choice of metric , . ] orientation and time - orientation ) is said to be globally hyperbolic if it has no closed causal curves and @xmath13 is compact for all @xmath14 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 3.2 ) for equivalence with the older definition  @xcite ) .",
    "denotes the set of points that can be reached by future ( @xmath15 ) or past ( @xmath16 ) directed causal curves originating from a point @xmath17 in @xmath12 ( including @xmath17 itself ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is a subset of @xmath12 , we write @xmath19 for the union @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . ]",
    "compactness of these regions ensures that experiments can be conducted within bounded spacetime regions , which could in principle be shielded , and that communication within the region can be achieved by finitely many radio links of finite range .",
    "technically , of course , the main use of global hyperbolicity is that it guarantees well - posedness of the klein ",
    "gordon equation and other field equations with metric principal part ( as described , for example , in prof .",
    "br s contribution to this workshop ) .",
    "henceforth we will assume that all spacetimes are globally hyperbolic and have at most finitely many connected components .",
    "the globally hyperbolic spacetimes constitute the objects of a category @xmath22 , in which the morphisms are taken to be hyperbolic embeddings .    a _",
    "hyperbolic embedding _ of @xmath12 into @xmath23 is an isometry @xmath24 preserving time and space orientations and such that @xmath25 is a causally convex of @xmath23 is causally convex if every causal curve in @xmath23 with endpoints in @xmath18 is contained wholly in @xmath18 . ]",
    "( and hence globally hyperbolic ) subset of @xmath23 .",
    "a hyperbolic embedding of @xmath24 allows us to regard @xmath23 as an enlarged version of @xmath12 : any experiment taking place in @xmath12 should have an analogue in @xmath25 which should yield indistinguishable results  at least if ` physics is the same ' in both spacetimes .",
    "bfv implemented this idea by regarding a physical theory as a functor from the category @xmath22 to a category @xmath26 , which encodes the type of physical system under consideration : the objects representing systems and the morphisms representing embeddings of one system in a larger one .",
    "bfv were interested in quantum field theories , described in terms of their algebras of observables . here , natural candidates for @xmath26 are provided by @xmath27 ( resp . , @xmath28 ) ,",
    "whose objects are unital @xmath0-algebras with unit - preserving injective @xmath29-homomorphisms as the morphisms",
    ". however , the idea applies more widely . for example , in the context of linear hamiltonian systems , a natural choice of @xmath26 would be the category @xmath30 of real symplectic spaces with symplectic maps as morphisms . as a more elaborate example , take as objects of a category @xmath31 all pairs @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( or @xmath28 ) and @xmath18 is a nonempty convex subset of the states on @xmath34 , closed under operations induced by @xmath34 . and @xmath35 has @xmath36 , then @xmath37 defines @xmath38 .",
    "] whenever @xmath39 is an @xmath27-morphism such that @xmath40 , we will say that @xmath41 induces a morphism @xmath42 in @xmath31 .",
    "it may be shown that @xmath31 is a category under the composition inherited from @xmath27 .",
    "this category provides an arena for discussing algebras of observables equipped with a distinguished class of states .",
    "the beauty of the categorical description is that it allows us to treat different types of physical theory in very similar ways .    according to bfv ,",
    "then , a theory should assign to each spacetime @xmath43 a mathematical object @xmath44 modelling ` the physics on @xmath12 ' and to each hyperbolic embedding @xmath24 a means of embedding the physics on @xmath12 inside the physics on @xmath23 , expressed as a morphism @xmath45 .",
    "the natural conditions that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are precisely those that make @xmath48 a ( covariant ) functor .    in particular , this gives an immediate definition of the ` local physics ' in any nonempty open globally hyperbolic subset @xmath49 of @xmath12 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the region @xmath49 with geometry induced from @xmath12 and considered as a spacetime in its own right ; this embeds in @xmath44 by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the obvious embedding . anticipating future developments , we refer to this as a _ kinematic _ description of the local physics .",
    "the kinematic description has many nice properties .",
    "restricted to minkowski space , and with @xmath54 , bfv were able to show that the net @xmath55 ( for nonempty open , relatively compact , globally hyperbolic @xmath49 ) satisfies the haag ",
    "kastler axioms of algebraic qft . as sub-@xmath56-algebras of @xmath44 . ] in general spacetimes",
    ", it therefore provides a generalisation of the haag  kastler framework .",
    "it is worth focussing on one particular issue .",
    "dimock  @xcite also articulated a version of haag  kastler axioms for curved spacetime qft and also expressed this partly in functorial language .",
    "however , dimock s covariance axiom was global in nature : it required that when spacetimes @xmath12 and @xmath23 are isometric then there should be an isomorphism between the nets of algebras on @xmath12 and @xmath23 . in the bfv framework",
    "this idea is localised and extended to situations in which @xmath12 is hyperbolically embedded in @xmath23 but not necessarily globally isometric to it . to be specific ,",
    "suppose that there is a morphism @xmath24 and that @xmath49 is a nonempty , open globally hyperbolic subset of @xmath12 with finitely many connected components .",
    "then @xmath57 also obeys these conditions in @xmath23 and , moreover , restricting the domain of @xmath58 to @xmath49 and the codomain to @xmath57 , we obtain an isomorphism @xmath59 making the diagram @xmath60 \\matrix ( m ) [ ampersand replacement=\\&,matrix of math nodes , row sep=3em , column sep=2.5em , text height=1.5ex , text depth=0.25ex ] { { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}|_o \\ &   { { \\boldsymbol{n}}}|_{\\psi(o ) } \\\\   { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}\\ & { { \\boldsymbol{n}}}\\\\ } ; \\path[->,font=\\scriptsize ] ( m-1 - 1 ) edge node[left ] { $ \\iota_{{{\\boldsymbol{m}}};o}$ } ( m-2 - 1 ) ( m-1 - 2 ) edge node[auto ] { $ \\iota_{{{\\boldsymbol{n}}};\\psi(o)}$ } ( m-2 - 2 ) ( m-2 - 1 ) edge node[auto ] { $ \\psi$ } ( m-2 - 2 ) ; \\path[->,font=\\scriptsize ] ( m-1 - 1 ) edge node[above]{$\\hat{\\psi}$ }   node[below ] { $ \\cong$ } ( m-1 - 2 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] commute . as functors always map commuting diagrams to commuting diagrams , and isomorphisms to isomorphisms , we obtain the commuting diagram @xmath60 \\matrix ( m ) [ ampersand replacement=\\&,matrix of math nodes , row sep=3em , column sep=2.5em , text height=1.5ex , text depth=0.25ex ] { { { \\mathscr{a}}}^{\\text{kin}}({{\\boldsymbol{m}}};o ) \\ &   { { \\mathscr{a}}}^{\\text{kin}}({{\\boldsymbol{n}}};\\psi(o ) ) \\\\   { { \\mathscr{a}}}({{\\boldsymbol{m } } } ) \\ &   { { \\mathscr{a}}}({{\\boldsymbol{n}}})\\\\ } ; \\path[->,font=\\scriptsize ] ( m-1 - 1 ) edge node[left ] { $ \\alpha^{\\text{kin}}_{{{\\boldsymbol{m}}};o}$ } ( m-2 - 1 ) ( m-1 - 2 ) edge node[auto ] { $ \\alpha^{\\text{kin}}_{{{\\boldsymbol{n}}};\\psi(o)}$ } ( m-2 - 2 ) ( m-2 - 1 ) edge node[auto ] { $ { { \\mathscr{a}}}(\\psi)$ } ( m-2 - 2 ) ; \\path[->,font=\\scriptsize ] ( m-1 - 1 ) edge node[above ] { $ { { \\mathscr{a}}}(\\hat{\\psi})$ } node[below ]   { $ \\cong$ } ( m-1 - 2 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\label{eq : kinematic_covariance_diagram}\\ ] ] in which , again anticipating future developments , we have written @xmath61 for the morphism @xmath62 embedding @xmath63 in @xmath44 .",
    "the significance of this diagram is that it shows that the kinematic description of local physics is truly local : it assigns equivalent descriptions of the physics to isometric subregions of the ambient spacetimes @xmath12 and @xmath23 .",
    "this holds even when there is no hyperbolic embedding of one of these ambient spacetimes in the other , as can be seen if we consider a further morphism @xmath64 , thus obtaining an isomorphism @xmath65 even though there need be no morphism between @xmath66 and @xmath23 .",

    "<S> brunetti , fredenhagen and verch ( bfv ) have shown how the notion of local covariance for quantum field theories can be formulated in terms of category theory : a theory being described as a functor from a category of spacetimes to a category of @xmath0-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss whether this condition is sufficient to guarantee that a theory represents ` the same physics ' in all spacetimes , giving examples to show that it does not . a new criterion , _ dynamical locality _ , </S>",
    "<S> is formulated , which requires that descriptions of local physics based on kinematical and dynamical considerations should coincide . </S>",
    "<S> various applications are given , including a proof that dynamical locality for quantum fields is incompatible with the possibility of covariantly choosing a preferred state in each spacetime .    </S>",
    "<S> as part of this discussion we state a precise condition that should hold on any class of theories each representing the same physics in all spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> this condition holds for the dynamically local theories but is violated by the full class of locally covariant theories in the bfv sense .    </S>",
    "<S> the majority of results described form part of forthcoming papers with rainer verch  @xcite . </S>"
