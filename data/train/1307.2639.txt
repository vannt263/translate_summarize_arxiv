    "in the last decade , a new understanding of integrability of discrete systems as their multi - dimensional consistency has been a major breakthrough @xcite , @xcite . this led to classification of discrete 2-dimensional integrable systems ( abs list ) @xcite , which turned out to be rather influential . according to the concept of multi - dimensional consistency ,",
    "integrable two - dimensional systems can be imposed in a consistent way on all two - dimensional sublattices of a lattice @xmath0 of arbitrary dimension .",
    "this means that the resulting multi - dimensional system possesses solutions whose restrictions to any two - dimensional sublattice are generic solutions of the corresponding two - dimensional system .",
    "to put this idea differently , one can impose the two - dimensional equations on any quad - surface in @xmath0 ( i.e. , a surface composed of elementary squares ) , and transfer solutions from one such surface to another one , if they are related by a sequence of local moves , each one involving one three - dimensional cube , like the moves shown of fig .",
    "[ fig : local moves ] .",
    "a further fundamental conceptual development was initiated in @xcite and deals with variational ( lagrangian ) formulation of discrete multi - dimensionally consistent systems .",
    "solutions of any abs equation on any quad surface @xmath1 in @xmath0 are critical points of a certain action functional @xmath2 obtained by integration of a suitable discrete lagrangian 2-form @xmath3 . it was observed in @xcite that the critical value of the action remains invariant under local changes of the underlying quad - surface , or , in other words , that the 2-form @xmath3 is closed on solutions of quad - equations , and it was suggested to consider this as a defining feature of integrability .",
    "results of @xcite , found on the case - by - case basis for some equations of the abs list , have been extended to the whole list and were given a more conceptual proof in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this research was pushed in various directions : for multi - field two - dimensional systems @xcite , for dkp , the fundamental three - dimensional discrete integrable system @xcite , and for the discrete time calogero - moser system , an important one - dimensional integrable system @xcite . a general theory of multi - time one - dimensional lagrangian systems has been developed in @xcite . in @xcite the general structure of multi - time euler - lagrange equations for two - dimensional lagrangian problems was studied , and it was shown that the corresponding 2-form @xmath3 is closed not only on solutions of ( non - variational ) quad - equations , but also on general solutions of the corresponding euler - lagrange equations .    as argued in the latter paper ,",
    "the original idea of @xcite has significant precursors .",
    "these include :    * _ theory of pluriharmonic functions _ and , more generally , of pluriharmonic maps @xcite . by definition , a pluriharmonic function of several complex variables @xmath4 minimizes the dirichlet functional @xmath5 along any holomorphic curve in its domain @xmath6 .",
    "differential equations governing pluriharmonic functions ( and maps ) are heavily overdetermined .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that they belong to the theory of integrable systems . *",
    "_ baxter s z - invariance _ of solvable models of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this concept is based on invariance of the partition functions of solvable models under elementary local transformations of the underlying planar graphs .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that one can identify planar graphs underlying these models with quad - surfaces in @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the classical mechanical analogue of the partition function is the action functional .",
    "this suggests the relation of z - invariance to the concept of closedness of the lagrangian 2-form , at least at the heuristic level .",
    "this relation has been made mathematically precise for a number of models , through the quasiclassical limit @xcite .",
    "* the classical notion of _ variational symmetry _",
    ", going back to the seminal work of e.  noether @xcite , turns out to be directly related to the idea of the closedness of the lagrangian form in the multi - time .",
    "the first of these precursors motivates the following term which was proposed in @xcite to describe the general framework of the deveopment we are speaking about : _ pluri - lagrangian systems_. a @xmath7-dimensional pluri - lagrangian problem can be set as follows : given a @xmath7-form @xmath3 on an @xmath8-dimensional space ( called multi - time , @xmath9 ) , whose coefficients depend on a sought - after function @xmath10 of @xmath8 independent variables ( called field ) , find those fields @xmath10 which deliver critical points to the action functionals @xmath2 for _ any _ @xmath7-dimensional manifold @xmath1 in the multi - time .",
    "the intention of the present note is to explain the relation of this notion to the third of the above mentioned precursors , namely to the notion of variational symmetries . for this aim",
    ", we recall the necessary definitions in section [ sect : var ] , illustrating them with one of the most familiar examples , the sine - gordon equation and its variational symmetry given by the modified kdv equation .",
    "then , in section [ sect : closed ] we establish the relation of these classical notions with the idea of closedness of the lagrangian form",
    ". finally , in section [ sect : pluri ] we present the euler - lagrange equations for two - dimensional pluri - lagrangian problems of second order , and establish the pluri - lagrangian structure of the sine - gordon equation .",
    "let us start with reminding the notion of a variational symmetry of lagrangian differential equations , introduced in the seminal paper by e.  noether @xcite ( see also a detailed historical discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the differential algebra of functions @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) of independent variables @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "it has generators @xmath15 , @xmath16 being a multiindex .",
    "the derivation @xmath17 , understood as a full derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath18 , acts on generators according to @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for any differential function @xmath20 we have @xmath21    we now define more general derivations ( generalized vector fields ) . in what follows , we only consider `` vertical '' ( or evolutionary ) generalized vector fields , i.e. , those acting on dependent variables only .",
    "this is done , on one hand , for simplicity of notation , and , on the other hand , because in the discrete case only these are relevant , due to the absence of changes of independent variable .    *",
    "( generalized evolutionary vector field ) * a generalized evolutionary vector field generated by the set of @xmath22 differential functions @xmath23=(\\varphi^1[u],\\ldots,\\varphi^q[u])$ ] is given by @xmath24    usually ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 5.6 ) ) , this is called an ( infinite ) prolongation of the generalized evolutionary vector field @xmath25 the following is an adaptation of definition 5.51 from @xcite .    *",
    "( variational symmetry ) * a generalized evolutionary vector field ( [ eq : gen vector field ] ) is called a _ variational symmetry _ of an action functional @xmath26=\\int l[u]dx^1\\ldots dx^p,\\ ] ] if the action of @xmath27 on the lagrange function @xmath28 is a complete divergence , that is , if there exist functions @xmath29,\\ldots , m_p[u]$ ] such that @xmath30    the intention of this definition is clear : the integral of a complete divergence ( by fixed boundary values ) vanishes , so @xmath27 preserves the value of the action functional . the following statement ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.53 ) ) justifies the previous definition .",
    "if a generalized evolutionary vector field @xmath27 is a variational symmetry of the action functional @xmath31 , then it is a generalized symmetry of the euler - lagrange equations @xmath32 .",
    "* example .",

    "the corresponding computation is mentioned in @xcite , but is not presented there in detail , being replaced by a less direct method .",
    "we show that @xmath39 with the following differential functions : @xmath40 & = & \\dfrac{1}{2}\\varphi u_x-\\dfrac{1}{8}u_x^4+\\dfrac{1}{2}u_{xx}^2 , \\label{eq : sg m}\\\\ n[u ] & = & \\dfrac{1}{2}\\varphi u_y -\\dfrac{1}{2}u_x^2\\cos u - u_{xx}(u_{xy}-\\sin u ) .",
    "\\label{eq : sg n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    indeed , we compute : @xmath41 and @xmath42 comparing ( [ eq : sg var sym aux1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sg var sym aux2 ] ) , we see that identity ( [ eq : sg var sym ] ) is satisfied under the choice of the differential function @xmath43 as in ( [ eq : phi ] ) . by the noether s theorem , existence of a variational symmetry leads to the corresponding conservation law for the sine - gordon equation : @xmath44 which can be also found in @xcite .",
    "now , we would like to promote an alternative point of view . in the standard approach , reproduced in the previous section , equation ( [ eq : var sym ] )",
    "is a certain ( differential-)algebraic property of the vector field @xmath27 .",
    "however , this way of thinking about this equation ignores one of the main interpretations of the notion of `` symmetry '' , namely the interpretation as a commuting flow . in this interpretation ,",
    "one introduces a _ new independent variable _",
    "@xmath45 corresponding to the `` flow '' of the generalized vector field @xmath27 , @xmath46,\\ ] ] and considers _ simultaneous solutions _ of the euler - lagrange equations @xmath32 and of the flow ( [ eq : flow sym ] ) as functions of @xmath47 independent variables @xmath48",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : var sym ] ) reads @xmath49 the key observation is that equation ( [ eq : var sym new ] ) is nothing but the _ closedness condition _ of the following @xmath50-form in the @xmath51-dimensional space : @xmath52\\ dx^1\\wedge \\ldots\\wedge dx^p-\\sum_{i=1}^p ( -1)^i m_i[u]\\ dz\\wedge dx^1\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge \\widehat{dx^i}\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge dx^p.\\ ] ] thus , we are led to define the _ extended action functional _",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath1 is some @xmath50-dimensional surface ( with boundary ) in the @xmath51-dimensional space of independent variables @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , the action @xmath54 over the hypersurface @xmath55 is the original action @xmath31 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : var sym new ] ) means that the extended action does not depend on local changes of the @xmath50-dimensional integration surface @xmath1 preserving boundary .",
    "of course , this statement only holds _ on simultaneous solutions _ of the euler - lagrange equations @xmath32 and of the flow ( [ eq : flow sym ] ) .",
    "* example . * to clearly see this in our above example of the sine - gordon equation , we re - write the previous computations in our new notation , i.e. , we replace @xmath43 by @xmath56 .",
    "we have : @xmath57\\ dx\\wedge dy - m[u]\\ dz\\wedge dx - n[u]\\ dy\\wedge dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 & = & \\dfrac{1}{2}u_xu_y-\\cos u , \\label{eq : sg lagr l}\\\\ m[u ] & = & \\dfrac{1}{2}u_xu_z-\\dfrac{1}{8}u_x^4+\\dfrac{1}{2}u_{xx}^2 , \\label{eq : sg lagr m}\\\\ n[u ] & = & \\dfrac{1}{2}u_yu_z-\\dfrac{1}{2}u_x^2\\cos u - u_{xx}(u_{xy}-\\sin u ) .",
    "\\label{eq : sg lagr n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the previous computation tells us that @xmath59 thus , the form @xmath3 is closed as soon as @xmath60 .",
    "this shows us once again that the modified kdv equation @xmath61 is a variational symmetry of the sine - gordon equation ( [ eq : sg ] ) .",
    "the remarkable factorized form of the right - hand side of ( [ eq : closure ] ) shows that it also vanishes as soon as @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests that the above relation could be reversed , namely , that the sine - gordon equation should be a variational symmetry of the modified kdv equation , as well .",
    "two facts apparently stand in the way of this interpretation : first , modified kdv equation is not lagrangian , and , second , sine - gordon equation is not evolutionary .",
    "nevertheless , this interpretation is still possible . to show this",
    ", we first observe that the function @xmath63 $ ] from ( [ eq : sg lagr m ] ) can be considered as a lagrangian for the action @xmath54 over the hypersurface @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding euler - lagrange equation @xmath65 is @xmath66 the differentiated form of modified kdv .",
    "it is this equation for which we want to declare the derivation @xmath67 as a variational symmetry . to overcome the difficulty that @xmath67 is not an evolutionary vector field ( i.e.",
    ", that @xmath68 is not defined by our differential equations ) , we observe that we only need to define the action of @xmath67 on the lagrangian @xmath69",
    ". however , the latter function does not contain @xmath70 alone , but only its derivatives ( of degree 1 w.r.t @xmath45 and of higher degrees w.r.t .",
    "@xmath10 ) . for such functions the formula @xmath71 works perfectly as an evolutionary vector field .",
    "indeed , one can use the equation @xmath72 which is obtained from ( [ eq : mkdv ] ) by differentiation upon use of the sine - gordon equation , as well as relations @xmath73 for multiindices @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "next , we regard the multi - time euler - lagrange equations for the pluri - lagrangian problem with the lagrangian 2-form @xmath3",
    ". we will not give the complete derivation , but restrict ourselves to the statement which covers our main example in this note , namely the sine - gordon equation .",
    "consider a pluri - lagrangian problem with the 2-form @xmath76dx^i\\wedge dx^j,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 are differential functions depending on the second jet of the sought - after function @xmath78 , so that @xmath79=l_{ij}(u , u_k , u_{km})$ ] .",
    "the system of _ multi - time euler - lagrange equations _ consists of : @xmath80 and @xmath81 here the following notations are used : @xmath82    equations ( [ eq : pluri 1])([eq : pluri 3 ] ) can be derived by considering action over coordinate planes as surfaces @xmath1 , while equations ( [ eq : pluri 4])([eq : pluri 6 ] ) are derived by considering general surfaces @xmath1 and are less obvious .",
    "* example : * sine - gordon equation .",
    "we have : @xmath83 for these lagrangians , the above system of multi - time euler - lagrange equations reduces to @xmath84 indeed , for @xmath85 the above system consists of 19 equations . with the present choice of @xmath86 ,",
    "the majority of these equations are satisfied identically .",
    "the non - trivial equations are derived from the following ones :    * equation ( [ eq : u xy ] ) is obtained from two equations , namely , from @xmath32 and from @xmath87 ; * equation ( [ eq : u xz ] ) is obtained from @xmath65 ; * equation ( [ eq : u yz ] ) is obtained from @xmath88 ; * equation ( [ eq : u xxy ] ) is obtained from @xmath89 ; * equation ( [ eq : u z ] ) is obtained from @xmath90    it remains to notice that equations ( [ eq : u xz])([eq : u xxy ] ) are corollaries of ( [ eq : u xy ] ) and ( [ eq : u z ] ) , derived by differentiation .",
    "multi - time euler - lagrange equations for the pluri - lagrangian problem with the 2-form ( [ eq : sg ext action ] ) with the components ( [ eq : sg lagr l])([eq : sg lagr n ] ) consist of the sine - gordon equation ( [ eq : u xy ] ) and the modified kdv equation ( [ eq : u z ] ) . on simultaneous solutions of these equations , the 2-form @xmath3 is closed .",
    "it is remarkable that multi - time euler - lagrange equations are capable of producing evolutionary equations .",
    "in subsequent publications , we will address the following problems :    * to derive multi - time euler - lagrange equations for pluri - lagrangian problems of arbitrary order , i.e. , for forms @xmath3 depending on jets of arbitrary order . * to extend the classical de donder - weyl theory of calculus of variations to the pluri - lagrangian context . * to elaborate on the pluri - lagrangian structure of classical integrable hierarchies , like the kdv or , more generally , gelfand - dickey hierarchies .",
    "note that in the monograph @xcite , which is , in my opinion , one of the best sources on the lagrangian field theory and whose program , according to the foreword , is `` that the book is about hierarchies of integrable equations rather than about individual equations '' , it is the lagrangian part ( chapters 19 , 20 ) that only deals with individual equations .",
    "the reason for this is apparently the absence of the concept of pluri - lagrangian systems . * to establish a general relation of pluri - lagrangian structure to more traditional notions of integrability . * to study the general relation of pluri - lagrangian structure to z - invariance of statistical - mechanical problems , via quasi - classical limit , as exemplified in @xcite .",
