    "recently , compton scattering with virtual photons ( virtual compton scattering , or vcs ) has attracted considerable experimental and theoretical interest ( for an overview see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both the near - threshold @xcite and high - momentum transfer regimes @xcite of vcs turn out to be very informative for studying the structure of hadrons .    in the below - threshold region",
    "a set of structure functions , the so - called generalized polarizabilities ( gps ) , has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to parametrize structure - dependent effects in the vcs amplitude to leading order in the final - photon momentum @xmath4 .",
    "these gps contain model - dependent information beyond the low - energy theorem ( let ) of real @xcite and virtual compton scattering @xcite .",
    "the first experimental results for generalized polarizabilities of the proton have recently been obtained at the mainz microtron ( mami ) for a four - momentum squared of @xmath6 gev@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "additional experiments aiming at proton polarizabilities are presently carried out at jefferson lab @xcite and mit - bates @xcite .",
    "a sensitivity study of inelastic high - energy pion - electron scattering on the pion vcs amplitude has been performed as part of the fermilab e781 selex experiment @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of the nucleon gps have been obtained in different frameworks such as the constituent quark model @xcite , the linear @xmath8-model @xcite , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , the skyrme model @xcite , models with effective photon - pion - nucleon lagrangians @xcite , and dispersion theories @xcite .",
    "pion and kaon gps have been discussed at the one - loop level of chpt @xcite ,    in the present paper we are not so much concerned with specific results for gps as obtained from various models of hadrons .",
    "our investigations are rather directed to an analysis of general properties of gps as well as their physical interpretation which , in our opinion , was only insufficiently covered previously .",
    "we mainly consider kinematical aspects , relegating dynamical aspects of properties of the generalized polarizabilities such as sum rules , dispersion relations , etc .  to a future publication . in order to avoid complications related with the spin of the target we only discuss the simplest case of a ( pseudo ) scalar particle like the pion .",
    "our considerations may as well be applied to the spin - averaged part of the vcs amplitude for a target of arbitrary spin . for illustrative purposes we make use of results obtained in the framework of chpt .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a new method of obtaining invariant amplitudes of electromagnetic reactions free from kinematical singularities and constraints , using ( double ) virtual compton scattering as an example .",
    "section iii contains a motivation for choosing a specific ( though standard ) form of the born amplitude which is used for separating convectional from internal contributions in the scattering amplitude . in sec .",
    "iv , we show how generalized dipole polarizabilities can be defined in a lorentz - invariant manner from the invariant amplitudes without introducing inconvenient singular kinematical factors .",
    "in particular , we show that it is natural to introduce one more dipole polarizability , namely , the transverse electric one , which is needed in order to recover the electric polarization of the target induced by a soft external electric field .",
    "this quantity does not contribute in the @xmath9 limit of previous analyses .",
    "we provide another explanation why to this order only two of the three spin - independent polarizabilities are accessible in photon electroproduction experiments .",
    "we give a physical interpretation of the generalized dipole polarizabilities in terms of densities of the induced electric and magnetic polarizations . in sec .",
    "v we argue that the associated space distributions are meaningful even for a light particle like the pion .",
    "we determine such space distributions at large distances @xmath5 derived from various form factors using the predictions of chpt . in passing ,",
    "we also include su(3)@xmath10 extensions of previous results obtained within two - flavor hbchpt .",
    "analytical results of spatial distributions obtained via dispersion relations are relegated to the appendix .",
    "in our discussion of virtual compton scattering off a spinless hadron , we will often refer to this hadron as a `` pion , '' although our general considerations also hold true for other spinless particles , nuclei , and even atoms , as well as for spin - averaged amplitudes .",
    "we start our analysis with an investigation of the general kinematical structure of the pion vcs amplitude @xmath11 for the case of two virtual photons , assuming that both initial and final pions are on shell .",
    "our aim is to construct a tensor basis and a related set of lorentz - invariant amplitudes @xmath12 , that provides a complete parametrization of @xmath11 .",
    "we require all @xmath12 to be free from kinematical singularities and constraints , because this simplifies the classification of low - energy characteristics of the pion , and also provides technical advantages , for instance when discussing dispersion relations .",
    "the problem of finding a set of amplitudes for vcs was already addressed and solved by tarrach for both spin-0 and spin-1/2 targets @xcite by using a projection technique originally proposed by bardeen and tung @xcite .",
    "although , in principle , we could directly use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we prefer to construct the tensor basis again , first , in order to demonstrate a very simple and powerful alternative method which avoids projections and , second , in order to rearrange the vcs tensor in a manifestly gauge - invariant form and to split it into structures contributing to real compton scattering , vcs with one photon virtual and , finally , vcs with both photons virtual .    to begin with , we define the amplitude @xmath11 of virtual compton scattering , [ vcsreaction ] ( , q ) + ( p ) ( ,q ) + ( p ) , as t_vcs = _ _ ^ t^ , where @xmath13 is the compton tensor given in terms of the covariant ( wick ) @xmath14-product of the electromagnetic currents , t _ = ( p)| it_w[j_(x ) j_(0 ) ] |(p)e^-iqxd^4x .",

    "also , the curvature as a function of @xmath145 is concave . for the proton , the @xmath349 , and the @xmath350 the asymptotic negative pion and kaon tails in the integral ( [ beta - slope ] ) dominate over the positive contribution coming from distances smaller than 1 fm , 1 fm , and 0.4 fm , respectively",
    "this makes the slopes of the magnetic polarizability of all baryons considered positive as a function of @xmath371 as well . on the other hand , such behavior is in some cases opposite to that expected from vmd .",
    "suppose the @xmath145 dependence of @xmath3 was determined by the @xmath163 or @xmath372 mesons mediating electromagnetic interactions , _ vmd = | . from this , the spatial distribution of @xmath195 _ vmd = m_^2 r e^-m_r| would have the same the sign as @xmath351 for all @xmath268 . for the @xmath373 and for the octet baryons , having positive @xmath351 ,",
    "such a sign is in conflict with the chpt behavior [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : q - beta - baryons ] and  [ fig : r - beta - baryons ] in which the vmd distributions are also shown ] . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", the full magnetic polarizability @xmath351 of the neutral pion should be approximately three times the @xmath335 prediction , mainly due to a paramagnetic contribution of the m1 transitions @xmath374 or @xmath375 .",
    "in other words , a more realistic vmd curve should be three times higher than that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - beta - mesons ] , so that the above conflict with chpt would be even more severe .",
    "in the case of the ( longitudinal ) electric polarizability of octet baryons the long - range , peripheral part is suppressed with increasing @xmath371 .",
    "this part is relatively large for all baryons except for the @xmath376 s , and thus @xmath1 shows a rapid decrease with increasing space - like @xmath139 which is steeper than for vmd [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : q - beta - baryons ] ] .",
    "another instructive feature of the plots shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : r - beta - mesons ] and [ fig : r - beta - baryons ] is that the kaon - loop contribution is concentrated at about the same scale of @xmath256 ( or even at smaller scales ) as the vmd contribution due to the large mass of kaon pairs , @xmath377 gev .",
    "kaon - loop contributions exactly fall into the short - range region where one finds other contributions of similar range treated via low - energy constants of the effective lagrangian of chpt .",
    "however , at @xmath378 no such counter terms contribute to the generalized polarizabilities .",
    "in other words , even though the relevant counter terms are formally of higher order in the power counting of chpt , one may wonder whether their quantitative importance is underrated as compared to the kaon - loop contributions .",
    "therefore , quantitative conclusions drawn from calculations keeping kaon loops and ignoring short - range contributions have to be treated with some care . for a similar conclusion , see ref",
    ".  @xcite .    the spatial distribution of @xmath195 for the nucleon shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - beta - baryons ] may also shed light on an old question which has remained open for more than 30 years : why is the magnetic polarizability @xmath351 of the proton so small ( @xmath379 @xcite ) , despite of a very large paramagnetic contribution of the @xmath320 resonance which , in various evaluations based on quark models , dispersion theories , effective lagrangians , etc .",
    ", ranges between + 7 to @xmath380 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", it is sometimes stated that the pion cloud produces a large diamagnetic ( i.e.  negative ) contribution to @xmath351 owing to the langevin mechanism producing a negative magnetic susceptibility of bound charges .",
    "this point of view became especially popular after calculations of @xmath381 in the skyrme model ( see , for example @xcite ) , in which the pion field of the soliton produces indeed a very big diamagnetic susceptibility resulting from the pion - cloud tail of the soliton , ranging from @xmath382 to @xmath383 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : r - beta - baryons ] , however , shows that the pion - cloud periphery with @xmath384  fm carries a very small diamagnetism of only @xmath385 , where the last number is expected to be a reliable estimate because chpt , even at leading nontrivial order , should be reasonable at such distances .",
    "we conclude that skyrme models overestimate the pion - cloud contribution to diamagnetism and that a source for the missing diamagnetism is probably related with short - range mechanisms rather than with the pion cloud itself . in some dispersion theories of compton scattering @xcite , an additional exchange with a hypothetical @xmath8-meson",
    "is invoked in order to generate agreement with existing experimental data .",
    "this , of course , is just an oversimplified model for such a short - range contribution .",
    "it would be very interesting and instructive to extend the presently available chpt predictions for the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon at least to order @xmath335 .",
    "this would allow one to check whether a modification of the density @xmath195 , including relativistic ( nucleon recoil ) effects and other higher - order corrections , indeed provides sufficient diamagnetism @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we have developed a covariant formalism leading to a parametrization of the vcs tensor in terms of lorentz invariants free from kinematical singularities and constraints .",
    "we motivated and performed a gauge - invariant division of the vcs tensor into contributions of generalized born terms and a structure - dependent residual part .",
    "we then discussed the case of a real final photon and a space - like virtual initial photon which can be described in terms of three invariant amplitudes depending on three kinematical variables . in the limit @xmath138",
    ", the three residual amplitudes reduce to functions of @xmath145 only which we identified as generalized dipole polarizabilities @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "all of them can , in principle , be determined in virtual compton scattering , although the transverse electric polarizability is not accessible in experiments sensitive to structure - dependent effects of @xmath9 only .",
    "we proposed a physical interpretation of these polarizabilities in terms of _ spatial _ distributions of an induced electric polarization and magnetization , respectively .",
    "in particular , we argued that a knowledge of all three polarizabilities is required for a full description of induced polarization phenomena . following this line , we calculated spatial distributions for pions , kaons , and the baryon octet as fourier integrals , using the predictions of chpt .",
    "it was found that the distributions obtained confirmed expectations based on a picture of a hadron s periphery caused by a  classical \" pion cloud . of course",
    ", any practical _ analysis _ of experimental data on photon _ scattering _ will eventually deal with the original , precisely defined momentum - space form factors , polarizabilities , etc .",
    "thus , one should handle the found spatial distributions with care . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath256-space interpretation of such @xmath139-dependent quantities clearly allows for a more intuitive visualization in analogy to the phenomenology and terminology of classical electrodynamics and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "he also thanks the institute for nuclear theory in seattle and the organizers of the cebaf ",
