    "albus 1 is a blue star ( @xmath4 mag ) but its true nature remains to be established .",
    "it was first recorded as cpd@xmath020  1123 @xcite with a photographic magnitude @xmath5mag but it did not attract much attention until @xcite proposed that the star might be a nearby ( @xmath6 pc ) hot white dwarf , or , alternatively , a hot subdwarf .",
    "they noted that the star stands out as the bluest of over a thousand objects investigated in an area of @xmath7 deg@xmath8 and covered by the tycho-2 and 2mass catalogues .",
    "the object is also known as tyc  5940  962  1 @xcite and 2mass  j06061339@xmath02021072 @xcite . @xcite",
    "located the star at @xmath9 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we present in  2 a series of optical spectra of cpd@xmath020  1123 obtained at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) which show the star to be a helium - rich b subdwarf .",
    "the star appears very similar to another well studied peculiar subdwarf , pg  0229@xmath10064 @xcite , but with markedly stronger optical lines .",
    "hot subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are core helium burning stars that lie at the hot end of the horizontal branch , i.e. , the extreme horizontal branch stars .",
    "these stars cover a narrow mass range around @xmath11 m@xmath12 and have very thin hydrogen ( @xmath13 m@xmath12 ) envelopes @xcite .",
    "they possibly evolved via two main branches .",
    "the first is through single star evolution where the star fails to ascend the asymptotic giant branch and loses most of its mass via extensive mass loss @xcite .",
    "the second is through binary star evolution , with one proposed scenario involving the merger of two helium white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted population syntheses of sdb stars and showed that most should have evolved in binary systems .",
    "helium - rich subdwarfs ( he - sdb ) have a higher abundance of helium and a systematically lower surface gravity compared to most sdb stars @xcite . the origin of he - sdb stars is still uncertain , but @xcite consider that a white dwarf merger is the most likely case . we complete our investigation of cpd@xmath020  1123 with a model atmosphere analysis in  3 , and we conclude in  4 .",
    "we have obtained three spectra of cpd@xmath020  1123 ( table  [ tbl1 ] ) using the r - c spectrograph attached to the ctio 4.0 m blanco telescope .",
    "we employed the kpgl2 grating in the first order and centered at 5109   resulting in a dispersion of @xmath14   per pixel .",
    "we also used the order - sorting filter wg360 which provided us with an effective coverage from @xmath15 to 7200  .",
    "we observed at the parallactic angle and the slit width was set at 1.5@xmath16 which resulted in a resolution element 4 pixels wide and a fwhm@xmath17  .",
    "finally we obtained a henear comparison arc after the series of exposures .",
    "we calibrated the spectrometer response with the flux standards eg 131 and feige 110 .",
    "however , the spectra of cpd@xmath020  1123 were obtained at a high airmass under poor seeing conditions , and with possible obstruction by clouds near the horizon which resulted in considerable light losses . nonetheless , the relative flux spectrum is of good quality with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath18 , although we could not secure the absolute flux scale .",
    "all data were reduced using standard procedures within iraf .",

    "the hydrogen balmer line series and numerous lines are evident .",
    "the lines appear stronger than in ordinary b subdwarf or main - sequence stars .",
    "the object bears similarities with a sample of he - rich subdwarf b stars studied by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of cpd@xmath020  1123 is also compared to a spectrum of the hot white dwarf euve  j0230@xmath0479 ( @xmath19 k , @xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) obtained with the same set - up on 2007 july 14 .",
    "the white dwarf euve  j0230@xmath0479 and the proto - typical da g191-b2b share similar properties but figure  [ fig1 ] shows that cpd@xmath020  1123 is not a hot white dwarf .",
    "the peculiar helium line spectrum clearly indicates an evolved star . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] compares cpd@xmath020  1123 and pg  0229@xmath10064 @xcite .",
    "we obtained the spectrum of pg  0229@xmath10064 from the isaac newton group archive .",
    "the spectrum was originally obtained by @xcite using the isis double - beam spectrograph attached to the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "the helium lines appear somewhat weaker in pg  0229@xmath10064 than in cpd@xmath020  1123 which may indicate that the helium abundance is somewhat higher in the latter . following a strict application of the subdwarf classification scheme proposed by @xcite cpd@xmath020  1123 , much like pg  0229@xmath10064 ,",
    "would be listed as a sdb3v : he15 where a classification index of he15 implies a deeper h@xmath21 line over the @xmath22 line .",
    "the absence of is consistent with a relatively low temperature compared to other helium - rich subdwarf stars . in order to find out whether or",
    "not the atmosphere is helium - rich it is necessary to perform a model atmosphere analysis .",
    "we computed a series of non - lte model atmospheres using tlusty version 200 and synspec version 48 @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional grid points are located at @xmath23 , and 22000 k , at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and at the helium abundance @xmath26 and @xmath11 .",
    "we fitted the balmer line spectrum ( from h@xmath27 to h9 ) and the line spectrum ( @xmath284026 , 4471 , 4713 , 4921 , and 5015 ) of cpd@xmath020  1123 using @xmath29 minimization techniques . table  [ tbl2 ] lists the atmospheric parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( see below ) of cpd@xmath020  1123 from this study , and the parameters of pg  0229@xmath10064 ( note that @xmath34 $ ] ) from @xcite . we also estimated the absolute magnitude @xmath33 of pg  0229@xmath10064 using parameters from @xcite .",
    "the helium to hydrogen abundance ratio is a factor of @xmath35 larger in cpd@xmath020  1123 than in pg  0229@xmath10064 , and it is comparable to abundance ratios measured in a few he - sdb stars studied by @xcite .",

    "we obtained the evolutionary tracks at @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 m@xmath12 with a solar abundance ( @xmath50 , [ fe@xmath51h]@xmath52[o@xmath51fe]=0.0 ) using the vizier database at the centre de donnes de strasbourg .",
    "we then located cpd@xmath020  1123 near the track at @xmath46 m@xmath12 in the @xmath31 versus @xmath30 plane . adopting a gravity of @xmath53",
    ", this mass implies a radius of @xmath54 r@xmath12 .",
    "next we calculated the absolute @xmath55 magnitude using the solid angle subtended by the star at 10 pc , @xmath56 , and the model flux at 5500  . based on the apparent optical magnitude from the all sky automated survey ( asas-3 ;",
    "* ) @xmath57 , and the calculated absolute magnitude @xmath58 , we estimate a distance of @xmath59 pc .",
    "therefore , a proper motion of 19 mas yr@xmath60 @xcite corresponds to a tangential velocity of @xmath61 km s@xmath60 characteristic of an old population in the thin disk or possibly in the thick disk @xcite .",
    "a detailed kinematical study awaits high - dispersion spectroscopy and accurate radial velocity measurements . on the other hand",
    "the location of cpd@xmath020  1123 in the @xmath31 versus @xmath30 plane also sits well with the he - he merger tracks of @xcite displayed by @xcite .",
    "the 2mass measurements do not support the presence of a cool companion to cpd@xmath020  1123 @xcite .",
    "infrared excess is a common feature among subdwarf stars and has often been used to infer the presence of a cool companion @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath62  line is clearly present in pg  0229@xmath10064 , it is not detected in cpd@xmath020  1123 .",
    "the detection of weaker lines will be best achieved in the future with the acquisition of high - dispersion spectra .",
    "abundance of trace elements offers clues to the origin of these objects . in the present instance , the absence of carbon would support a he - he white dwarf merger origin .",
    "overall , the origin of cpd@xmath020  1123 remains an open question .",
    "we show that cpd@xmath020  1123 is a he - sdb .",
    "the spectrum shows strong lines along with the hydrogen balmer line series .",
    "the atmosphere is dominated by helium , but high - dispersion spectra are required to carry - out a detailed abundance analysis .",
    "present evidence indicates that cpd@xmath020  1123 may be the result of he - he white dwarf merger , although post horizontal- or giant - branch evolutionary scenarios can not be excluded .",
