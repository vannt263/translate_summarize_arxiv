    "pinning / wetting models with quenched disorder describe the random interaction between a directed polymer and a one - dimensional _ defect line_. in absence of interaction , a typical polymer configuration is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a markov chain on some state space @xmath12 ( for instance , @xmath13 for @xmath14-dimensional directed polymers ) , and the initial condition @xmath15 is some fixed element of @xmath12 which by convention we call @xmath16 .",

    "the polymer - line interaction is introduced as follows : each time @xmath18 ( _ i.e. _ , the polymer touches the line at step @xmath19 ) the polymer gets an energy reward / penalty @xmath20 , which can be either positive or negative . in the situation we consider here ,",

    "the model undergoes a localization / delocalization phase transition : for any given value @xmath32 of the disorder strength , if the average pinning intensity @xmath21 exceeds some critical value @xmath33 then the polymer typically stays tightly close to the defect line and the free energy is positive . on the contrary ,",
    "for @xmath34 the free energy vanishes and the polymer has only few contacts with the defect : entropic effects prevail .",

    "@xcite is the following : disorder should be irrelevant for @xmath4 , meaning that quenched critical point and critical exponents should coincide with the annealed ones if @xmath39 is small enough , and relevant for @xmath40 : they should differ for every @xmath41 . in the marginal case @xmath5 , the harris criterion gives no prediction and there is no general consensus on what to expect : renormalization - group considerations led forgacs _",

    "a lot is now known on the _ irrelevant - disorder regime_. in particular , it was proven in @xcite ( see @xcite for an alternative proof ) that quenched and annealed critical points and critical exponents coincide for @xmath39 small enough . moreover , in @xcite a small - disorder expansion of the free energy , worked out in @xcite , was rigorously justified .",
    "2 .   in the _ strong - disorder regime _ , for which the harris criterion makes no prediction , a few results were obtained recently . in particular , in @xcite it was proven that for any given @xmath42 and , say , for gaussian randomness , @xmath43 for @xmath39 large enough , and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath33 for @xmath44 was computed .",
