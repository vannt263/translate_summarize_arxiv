    "coulomb screening in graphene @xcite provides a glimpse of the strong nonperturbative qed effects @xcite and gives information about the measurable transport properties @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of the coulomb screening can be analyzed in several ways .",
    "one method is to use the green s function technique @xcite , which was originally developed using the solutions of the corresponding eigenvalue equation @xcite .",
    "subsequently a more powerful operator formalism for the green s function was introduced in qed @xcite , which has been adapted to the case of planar graphene @xcite .",
    "another approach for studying coulomb screening is provided by friedel sum rule @xcite , which uses the spectral data in the scattering sector . in this approach",
    ", the induced charge is related to the scattering phase shift .",
    "this technique has also been applied to a variety of fermionic systems @xcite including planar graphene @xcite .",
    "if the external coulomb charge in graphene exceeds a certain critical value , the system exhibits quantum instability .",
    "this is characterized by a rapid oscillatory behaviour of the wavefunction near the location of the charge @xcite .",
    "in addition , quasi - bound states appear in the spectrum for gapless graphene @xcite , for which there is recent experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are manifestations of strong nonperturbative qed effects .",
    "topological defects provide another source of nonperturbative quantum effects in graphene @xcite .",
    "a graphene cone provides a simple prototype of a topological defect , which can be obtained by cutting a sector of planar graphene and gluing the two edges of the removed sector .",
    "this conical defect generates nontrivial holonomies of the quasiparticle wavefunction @xcite , which can be modelled through the introduction of a fictitious magnetic flux tube with a suitable vector potential .",
    "the problem of the coulomb charge in a graphene cone can therefore be related to an equivalent problem of the coulomb charge in planar graphene with a suitably chosen magnetic flux tube .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show how the conical defect affects the coulomb screening and related physical observables in gapless graphene . in the subcritical regime of the external charge",
    ", the screening is analyzed using both the green s function and the friedel sum rule .",
    "we follow the operator technique @xcite to calculate the green s function from which the induced charge density is obtained .",
    "our calculation clearly shows the effect of the conical defect on coulomb screening .",
    "in particular , a plot of the induced charge against the coulomb strength indicates how the conical defect modifies the value of the critical charge .",
    "we also calculate the induced charge using the friedel sum rule @xcite . for the case of planar graphene",
    ", these two approaches agree for low values of the external charge and starts to show divergence as the critical value of the charge is approached . in the presence of the conical defect , the difference shows up at much lower value of the external charge .",
    "this could be indicative of certain subtleties associated with the friedel sum rule in the presence of singularities @xcite .",
    "for both the green s function and friedel sum rule approach , our calculations with the conical defect have the correct planar limit . for a given value of the subcritical charge ,",
    "the transport cross - section has higher value in the presence of the topological defect .",
    "similarly , the ldos is also affected by the topological defect .    in the supercritical regime ,",
    "the induced charge for planar graphene has already been obtained in the literature using both the green s function @xcite and the friedel sum rule @xcite . here",
    "we show how the topological defect affects the scattering phase shifts in the supercritical regime .",
    "this leads to the corresponding effect on the induced charge via the friedel sum rule .",
    "the polarization charge density in the supercritical regime exhibits a power law tail .",
    "the coefficient of the power law tail can be written as a sum of functions which vary log periodically with the distance from the coulomb impurity @xcite .",
    "we show that this period is affected by the presence of the conical defect . in the presence of the topological defect",
    ", the fano resonances @xcite appear for a lower value of the charge .",
    "this indicates that the conical topology affects the value of the critical charge .",
    "we also calculate the ldos and find its dependence on the conical defect .",
    "these results could be of interest in the context of graphene based electronic devices @xcite . in the supercritical regime also , our results have the correct planar limit .",
    "for certain parameter ranges in the subcritical regime , the gapless graphene system admits generalized boundary conditions @xcite . when a coulomb charge is embedded in a graphene sheet",
    ", it can induce various short range interactions .",
    "effect of these interactions can not be directly incorporated in the dirac equation which is valid only in the long wavelength limit .",
    "the generalized boundary conditions encode an average effect of such short range interactions .",
    "the physical observables of the system depend on the choice of these generalized boundary conditions .",
    "here we have shown how such generalized boundary conditions affect the ldos and transport cross - section in the presence of the topological defect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we calculate the induced charge using the green s function in a subcritical coulomb field in graphene cone .",
    "next we analyze the subcritical region using the friedel sum rule and show how the physical quantities depend explicitly on the sample topology .",
    "we discuss the effect of topological defect on the electrical conductivity of the system .",
    "we compare our results obtained using green s function technique and friedel sum rule . in section 3",
    "the analysis of the corresponding spectrum is done in the supercritical region .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the effect of generalized boundary conditions in the subcritical regime in section 4 .",
    "we conclude this paper with a summary in section 5 .",
    "our system consists of an external coulomb charge impurity at the apex of a gapless graphene cone . in order to set up the formalism ,",
    "we first consider planar graphene . for technical reasons",
    "@xcite it is useful to introduce a mass @xmath0 for the quasiparticles in graphene .",

    "when @xmath23 , eq.([g15 ] ) reduces to the green s function for planar graphene .",
    "the crucial point to note at this stage is that the integral in eq.([g15 ] ) has the same analytical structure as that for the planar graphene , which is a consequence of our treatment of the conical defect . due to this",
    ", we can follow the analysis in @xcite in order to evaluate the integral in eq.([g15 ] ) .",
    "this calculation involves the choice of a suitable contour of integration @xcite . the resulting expression for the induced charge is divergent , which requires a renormalization as in the case of qed @xcite .",
    "the condition that the total induced charge is zero is imposed as a physical requirement in the renormalization process .",
    "this is possible due to the presence of the infrared cutoff given by the quasiparticle mass @xmath0 and it is for this reason that @xmath0 was introduced .",
