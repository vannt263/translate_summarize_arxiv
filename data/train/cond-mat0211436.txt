    "the theoretical framework presented here to describe systems on the border of magnetism can be translated to describe systems on the border of other types of instabilities , such as charge - density - wave or ferroelectric instabilities .",
    "the same type of calculations could be carried out in those other cases , and compared to the results of this paper , shedding light on the similarities and differences between the many possible pairing mechanisms .",
