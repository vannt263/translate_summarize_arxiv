    "the purpose of new high energy colliders is to explore the energy scales associated with the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "however , it is possible that any given machine will be operating at energies below that which is necessary to excite the lightest new particle . in that case",

    "this scenario makes it interesting to parameterize the symmetry breaking sector of the theory in a model independent way by means of an effective lagrangian , and to explore the sensitivity of present and future experiments to the couplings introduced in this parameterization .    in this paper",

    "the possibility of observing the sm higgs boson at such colliders through the process @xmath12 has been previously discussed , and it was found that a 1  tev @xmath3 collider operating in the @xmath11 mode should be able to discover a higgs boson in the intermediate mass range @xmath13  gev @xcite . here",
    "we assume that there is no higgs boson ( at least not with a mass that makes it directly accessible to the machine ) and investigate the sensitivity of an @xmath11 collider to the three and four gauge - boson self - interactions @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the process @xmath14 for several reasons .",
    "this process depends on only a few of the anomalous couplings , and at very high energies it singles out one coupling .",
    "the process is thus ideally suited to isolate the effects of this one coupling , the parity violating but @xmath15 conserving @xmath2 .",
    "this process also has a relatively small sm background as we will discuss in section 3 .    in section 2 ,",

    "it is a non - renormalizable theory that is interpreted as an effective field theory , valid below some scale @xmath30  tev .",
    "the lowest order interactions between the gauge bosons and fermions are the same as those in the minimal standard model .    in writing the lagrangian of eq .",

    "we will consider the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian containing all terms which conserve the custodial @xmath31 ( up to hypercharge couplings ) .",

    "the amplitude for the process @xmath41 is enhanced when the @xmath42 and @xmath28 are longitudinally polarized .",
    "roughly , the amplitude gains an enhancement factor @xmath43 for each longitudinal polarization , and the largest enhancement is thus obtained when all three gauge bosons are longitudinally polarized .",
    "we could compute this enhanced amplitude by using the equivalence theorem and replacing each longitudinally polarized gauge boson with its corresponding would - be goldstone boson . for the largest enhancement we would thus be calculating the amplitude for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 are the would - be goldstone bosons corresponding to the longitudinal components of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , this process will not take place unless parity is violated ( since we are not considering the possibility of having wess - zumino - witten terms for the effective theory ) .",
    "this leads us to believe that the process @xmath16 will single out the parity violating couplings at high energy .",
    "for this reason , out of the many terms that break the custodial symmetry in the next to leading order lagrangian , we only consider the one that also violates parity .",
    "this term will yield enhanced interactions at high energies .",
    "there are other terms that violate parity , but they also violate @xmath15 . we know that the weak interactions violate parity maximally , but that observed @xmath15 violation is very small . with this in mind , we do not expect the @xmath46 violating but @xmath15 conserving operator to have any special suppression factors in general . at the same time , we might expect the @xmath15 violating operators to have smaller couplings than one would estimate from simple power counting rules .",
    "we will not consider the @xmath15 violating operators in this paper .",

    "the physical motivation for this assumption is that , even if we do not see any new resonances directly , the effects of the new physics from high mass scales must clearly stand out if there is to be any hope of observing them . when the indirect effects of the new physics enter at the level of sm radiative corrections , very precise experiments ( as the ones being performed at lep i ) are needed to unravel them .",
    "we are assuming that there will not be any such precision measurements in the next generation of high energy colliders .",

    "due to a jacobian peak in the @xmath161 two - body kinematics , similar enhancements in the @xmath162 or @xmath163 distributions also appear in the high energy region .    the existing data from the cern @xmath164 collider @xcite and lep i @xcite only constrain the anomalous couplings @xmath165 rather weakly .",
    "the bound is @xmath166 , which translates into @xmath167 .",
    "the fermilab tevatron with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath154 can provide comparable results to this bound  @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that the lhc will be sensitive to values @xmath168 and @xmath169 ; @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "it is well known that lep ii will provide a good environment to study the three gauge - boson anomalous couplings @xcite at a sensitivity of @xmath172 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath173 .",
    "there are several studies in the literature for an @xmath3 machine with @xmath174 tev concentrating on the @xmath175 mode .",
    "the claim is that a sensitivity of order @xmath5 to @xmath176 can be reached with 50 fb@xmath154 integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "this would correspond to potential sensitivities of about @xmath177 to the couplings @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath55 ( we have made no attempt to study differences between these three couplings in that process ) .",
    "this machine running in the @xmath0 mode is also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite as a means of searching for anomalous couplings , and it is found that with 50 fb@xmath154 a 7% sensitivity to @xmath178 , corresponding to @xmath179 , is feasible .",
    "in contrast , not many studies have been done in the literature concerning the coupling @xmath180 ( or @xmath102 ) .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the process @xmath175 may be sensitive to @xmath180 at a high energy @xmath106 machine if highly polarized electron beams can be obtained .",
    "finally , let us comment on the event reconstruction and other possible backgrounds .",
    "with the leptonic decays of @xmath181 , there is little background to anomalous coupling signals except for the lowest order @xmath161 production which we have systematically included in our discussion ( @xmath134 in eq .",
    "[ csp ] ) . in estimating the sensitivities in our figures ,",
    "we have implicitly assumed the full use of the hadronic decay modes , in which the four jets in pairs reconstruct to @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the inclusion of the hadronic modes increases the event rate significantly and will make a better @xmath160 mass reconstruction possible as well .",
    "it would be ideal to have a good hadronic energy resolution ( better than @xmath184 gev ) in order to be able to distinguish the @xmath27 or @xmath28 decays via the di - jet mass .",
    "if possible , this would essentially eliminate other backgrounds .",
    "given the fact that this hadronic energy resolution may be difficult to achieve , one has to make use of other kinematic cuts to reduce potential backgrounds .",
    "the potential backgrounds are @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , which have all been analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the search for the sm higgs boson . among the backgrounds , the @xmath187 , and @xmath188",
    "are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the sm process @xmath189 and they are sufficiently different from our signal process in terms of the final state particles and kinematics . however , the cross section for the process @xmath190 is about an order of magnitude larger than the sm @xmath161 process .",
    "based on the fact that the major contribution to @xmath190 is from the almost on - shell photon exchange @xmath191 , we can substantially reduce it by pushing the photon propagator away from the pole .",
    "our @xmath192 cut is designed for this purpose .",
    "furthermore , in our @xmath161 signal the transverse momentum of the boson pair is balanced by the missing transverse momentum ( essentially from the @xmath193 ) ; whereas the @xmath190 background will have a visible @xmath111 with large transverse momentum .",
    "we can therefore further reduce this background by requiring not only large @xmath192 but also , at the same , time vetoing the hard electrons @xcite .",
    "overall , the only significant irreducible background for our study of anomalous couplings is the lowest order sm process @xmath194 , which we have included .",
    "if the electroweak symmetry breaking sector is strongly coupled , and no light resonances are found , then one expects deviations of the gauge - boson self - interactions from the sm predictions .",
    "an @xmath0 collider operating at @xmath195  tev can provide important input into our understanding of the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "such a collider would provide more precise measurements of @xmath196 than the lhc via the process @xmath16 .",
    "due to the gauge structure and the relatively large contribution of the gauge - boson self - interactions to this process , it is as useful in studying anomalous couplings as the lower order process @xmath197@xcite .",
    "although the process @xmath175 is better to study the coefficients @xmath196 , the process @xmath16 is very sensitive to the coupling @xmath155 , especially at higher energies .",
    "we find that an @xmath106 machine operating in the @xmath11 mode with @xmath141 tev can place bounds of order @xmath198 with 20 fb@xmath154 integrated luminosity .",
    "similarly , it is possible at a 2 tev @xmath106 collider running in the @xmath0 mode to place the bound @xmath199 , which corresponds to @xmath200 .",
    "observation of enhanced production of longitudinal @xmath161 pairs in the high @xmath160 region and at central @xmath201 could be a direct indication for a new interaction of the form proportional to @xmath155 .",
