    "<S> the main results from the auger observatory are described . </S>",
    "<S> a steepening of the spectrum is observed at the highest energies , supporting the expectation that above @xmath0  ev the cosmic ray energies are significantly degraded by interactions with the cmb photons ( the gzk effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by the correlations observed above @xmath1  ev with the distribution of nearby active galaxies , which also show the potential of auger to start the era of charged particle astronomy . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of observation of photons or neutrinos strongly disfavors top - down models , and these searches may approach in the long term the sensitivity required to test the fluxes expected from the secondaries of the very same gzk process . </S>",
    "<S> bounds on the anisotropies at eev energies contradict hints from previous experiments that suggested a large excess from regions near the galactic centre or the presence of a dipolar type modulation of the cosmic ray flux .    * </S>",
    "<S> introduction : * after having been studied for almost a century , cosmic rays ( crs ) still offer many puzzling results , particularly at the highest energies which are now being explored at the pierre auger observatory . from @xmath2  ev up to about @xmath3  ev the spectrum of cosmic particles is essentially a power law d@xmath4/d@xmath5 , with @xmath6 , with some small but relevant breaks at the so - called knee ( at about @xmath7  ev ) , the second knee ( slightly above @xmath8  ev ) and the ankle ( at about @xmath9  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the steeply falling nature of the cr spectrum implies that although the fluxes are large at low energies , i.e. of order 1 particle per @xmath10 per second in the gev range , they become extremely small in the highest energy end , e.g. of about 1  particle per km@xmath11 per century above @xmath12  ev . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that huge detectors are required to gather sizeable statistics in this last regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - thermal nature of crs is what led fermi to speculate that their acceleration was the result of stochastic processes involving charged particles in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields , what later evolved into the scenario of diffusive acceleration in shock waves . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the crs of low energies may be produced in this way in galactic supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> but the highest energies are so extreme that only a few sites are large enough and have sufficiently strong magnetic fields to be ( marginally ) able to produce them , with possible candidates being active galactic nuclei and gamma - ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> if indeed the highest energy cosmic rays are extragalactic , as is also suggested by the lack of observed anisotropies associated with the galactic plane , a further issue is that inelastic collisions with cmb photons are expected to degrade the cr energies as they propagate . </S>",
    "<S> if crs are protons this takes place by photopion production , while if they are heavier nuclei the dominant process is photodisintegration . in both cases losses become important above a certain energy threshold , which coincidentally is @xmath13  ev for both protons and fe nuclei , and is somewhat smaller for lighter nuclei . as a consequence of this </S>",
    "<S> , the spectrum is expected to steepen above this so - called gzk threshold even if the sources continue to be powerful . until very recently the existence , or otherwise , of this suppression </S>",
    "<S> was strongly debated , with results from the agasa instrument ( detecting air showers at ground level with scintillators ) not observing any signs of it , while the hires experiment ( looking to the fluorescence emitted in the air by nitrogen molecules excited by the passage of the shower ) found indications in favor of it .    </S>",
    "<S> this situation led in the past to the proposal of many exotic scenarios to overcome the limitations of the bottom - up acceleration in known astrophysical sources , in which crs were produced instead in a top - down way , e.g. from decays of topological defects or superheavy relics from the early universe , from ` z - burst ' models , etc . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main distinguishing features of the top - down scenarios is that a large fraction of photons and neutrinos should be present at the highest energies . </S>",
    "<S> also exotic physics , such as lorentz invariance violation , was sometimes invoked to avoid the prediction of a gzk suppression . anyway , the agasa and hires results were based on small number of events and , using different techniques , were affected by different systematics . to overcome these difficulties the auger observatory was conceived as a hybrid detector combining the two detection methods and covering an area 30 times bigger than that of agasa . as is discussed below , even during the auger construction phase which is now </S>",
    "<S> almost finished , it proved possible to obtain measurements of the cr spectrum , composition and arrival directions which already contributed significantly to the progress in this field .    </S>",
    "<S> * the observatory and recent results : * the auger observatory is located near the town of malarge , argentina , at 35.2@xmath14  s latitude and 1400  m a.s.l . </S>",
    "<S> it is an international collaboration of about 400 scientists from 17 countries . </S>",
    "<S> the observatory has a hybrid design , with the surface detector ( sd ) consisting of a grid of 1600 water cherenkov stations with 1.5  km spacing , covering a total of 3000  km@xmath11 , and the fluorescence detector ( fd ) consisting of 4 buildings on the outskirts of the sd array , each one with 6 telescopes that overlook the array covering @xmath15 in elevation and 180@xmath14 in azimuth . </S>",
    "<S> the surface detectors are tanks with 12  tonnes of pure water in which cherenkov light is produced by both the electromagnetic and the muonic component of the air showers . </S>",
    "<S> this light , after reflection by the diffuse liner , is detected by three 9  phototubes . </S>",
    "<S> three or more nearby triggered stations are required to detect a shower , and while the relative timing ( with a 25  ns sampling ) gives the information on the arrival direction , the size of the signal contains information on the shower energy @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> a fit is indeed performed to timing and signal data to reconstruct the location of the shower core and the lateral distribution of the shower . from this the expected signal size at 1000  m from the core , @xmath17 , is obtained , and this is used as an estimator of the shower energy . </S>",
    "<S> actually , for a given cr energy the showers with different zenith angles @xmath18 are being sampled at ground level in different stages of their development , so that the relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath16 is @xmath18 dependent . </S>",
    "<S> a direct way to obtain this attenuation effect without relying on shower simulations is to use the fact that the cr flux is essentially isotropic , so that above a given energy one expects a uniform number of events in bins of equal exposure ( i.e. in bins of cos@xmath19 once the detector is fully efficient , which is the case for @xmath20  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , looking in each bin of cos@xmath19 for the value of the signal above which there is a certain fixed given number of events , the @xmath18 dependence of the relation between @xmath17 and energy is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a quantity @xmath21 to be assigned for each value of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which is the signal that would have been observed had the shower arrived with @xmath22 ( the median zenith for the showers with @xmath23 , which is the range in which most analyses rely ) . to calibrate the energies one can use the showers measured with both sd and fd during clear moonless nights . for these hybrid showers </S>",
    "<S> the energy can be measured almost calorimetrically with fd by fitting the longitudinal development of the shower , integrating it to include the tails and accounting also for the unobserved particles in the shower ( neutrinos and muons ) . however , since what is observed by the fd telescopes is the light emitted by the air molecules , not directly the energy deposited by the shower particles , the inferred energy depends sensitively on the value adopted for the fluorescence yield , which is unfortunately still subject to significant systematic errors ( for instance auger and hires use determinations that differ by about @xmath24% ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the determination of the fluorescence yields will improve soon , allowing a major source of systematic uncertainty in the determination of the shower energies to be eliminated . with this set of hybrid events a relation of the form @xmath25 can be fitted to the data , as is shown in fig .  1 , and </S>",
    "<S> this can then be used to obtain the energies of all the sd events ( only about 15% of the showers are hybrid ) . from the inset in the figure </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that a 19% dispersion remains in this relation , associated mainly to the reconstruction procedure and to shower - to - shower fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic uncertainty in the energy assignment is 22% .    </S>",

    "<S> lower panel shows fractional differences of hires i and auger data with respect to a power law with index @xmath26 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum obtained @xcite from the events collected up to august 2007 ( about 20000 events above @xmath27  ev , with about four times the exposure of agasa and twice that of hires ) is shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> to better appreciate the suppression at the highest energies it is also shown in the lower panel normalized to the power law @xmath28 which fits the spectrum below @xmath0  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers of events expected if this power law were to hold above @xmath29  ev or @xmath3  ev , would be @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while 69 events and 1 event are observed , clearly showing the strong suppression present and rejecting the simple power law extrapolation at more than 6@xmath32 level . for comparison also </S>",
    "<S> the latest hires @xcite results are shown , with the two experiments being in agreement , except for a possible systematic energy mismatch that is necessary to account for the different flux normalizations obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> if the suppression in the cr spectrum is indeed due to the interactions with the cmb photons ( and not just due to an unfortunate coincidence with the maximum attainable energies at the sources ) a further crucial point is that when looking at energies above the gzk threshold the only crs that can reach us are those produced in relatively nearby sources ( for instance , above @xmath1  ev 90% of the protons should come from less than @xmath33  mpc , while 50% should come from less than 90  mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the arrival directions of the highest energy crs are expected to be correlated with the nearby matter distribution , which is quite inhomogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> observing this kind of correlations can be a first step towards doing actual cr astronomy . </S>",
    "<S> note that a major difficulty for charged particle astronomy is the fact that deflections in the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields may well be large , of order @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the cr charge . on the other hand , the angular resolution of auger above @xmath36  </S>",
    "<S> ev is better than one degree .    </S>",
    "<S> probability for the null hypothesis ( isotropy ) vs. @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in each case </S>",
    "<S> the other two parameters are kept fixed at the values leading to the minimum probability ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42  eev ) . ]    to test for possible correlations with extragalactic sources the auger collaboration analyzed the arrival directions of the events above @xmath0  ev to look for coincidences with the positions of the known nearby ( less than 100  mpc ) active galactic nuclei @xcite . given the unknown magnetic deflections , the possible systematic uncertainties in energy as well as the unknown cr composition ( what would also affect the gzk horizon distance ) , a scan over the angle @xmath37 between the events and the agns , the maximum agn redshift considered @xmath38 and the threshold energy @xmath39 is performed to search for the most significant correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this scan are shown in fig .  3 , showing a deep minimum in the probability @xmath43 of observing a similar or larger number of correlations arising from isotropic simulated data . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum is obtained for @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( or maximum agn distance of @xmath46  mpc ) and @xmath47  eev ( corresponding to the 27 highest energy events ) , where 1  @xmath48  ev . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath49 of the isotropic simulations have a deeper minimum under a similar scan . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for these 27 events 20 are at less than @xmath50 from an agn closer than 71  mpc , while only 6 were expected to be found by chance from an isotropic distribution of arrival directions . </S>",
    "<S> a correlation was first observed in the data obtained before the end of may 2006 , with a very similar set of parameters , and fixing that set of parameters a priori the subsequent data up to august 2007 were studied , confirming the original correlation with more than 99% cl significance in the additional data set alone .    </S>",
    "<S> the map of the arrival directions and of the agn positions is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . a remarkable alignment of several events with the supergalactic plane ( dashed line ) </S>",
    "<S> is observed , and it is also worth noting that two events fall within 3.2@xmath14 from centaurus  a , the closest active galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> a further interesting fact is that the energy maximizing the correlation with agns coincides with that maximizing the autocorrelation of the events themselves @xcite and is also that for which the spectrum falls to half of the power law extrapolation from smaller energies ( fig .  2 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> shading indicates regions of equal exposure . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us also mention that a search for correlations with bl lacs gave negative results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another important search performed by auger was to look for the presence of photons in the highest energy crs . </S>",
    "<S> one possible signature of photon showers is their comparatively larger values of @xmath52 , the column depth of air at which the longitudinal development reaches a maximum . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the slower development of purely electromagnetic showers with respect to hadronic ones . </S>",
    "<S> a first limit was set using this technique in @xcite using the fd measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a more sensitive search for photons was done using the full statistical power of the sd detector and looking at the risetime of the sd signals ( which are slower in muon poor showers ) and the curvature radius of the front of the showers ( which is smaller in late developing showers ) . </S>",
    "<S> this led to the bounds @xcite displayed in fig .  5 , which show in particular that above @xmath36  ev only less than 2% of the crs may be photons . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes most of the top - down model predictions ( also shown in the figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of photons expected ( dashed region ) from the decays of neutral pions produced in the gzk process , if crs at the highest energies are proton dominated , is somewhat below present sensitivities , but may be within the reach of future searches .     </S>",
    "<S> 90% cl bounds on diffuse flux of @xmath53 from auger . </S>",
    "<S> bounds from other experiments apply assuming equal proportions of the three @xmath54 flavors ( horizontal lines assume @xmath55 spectrum ) . </S>",

    "<S> shaded region indicates possible expectations from gzk neutrinos . ]    </S>",
    "<S> also neutrinos have been searched with auger trying to identify horizontal showers with a significant electromagnetic component ( i.e. young showers produced by deeply penetrating particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the background from horizontal showers of hadronic origin would have their electromagnetic component attenuated well before reaching ground , being then dominated by the muonic component that just produces narrow pulses in the sd detectors . searching then for elongated footprints on the ground consistent with the horizontal propagation of the shower front at close to the speed of light and requiring that a large fraction of the triggered detectors have broad ` electromagnetic rich ' pulses </S>",
    "<S> allows then to identify the neutrino induced showers . </S>",
    "<S> no candidates of this kind were found up to now . </S>",
    "<S> although electron or tau neutrinos from slightly above the horizon may produce this type of signals , the most sensitive search is that for tau neutrinos from slightly below the horizon , since they can interact in the rock and the tau leptons so produced can travel several tens of km before decaying , and hence can be efficiently observed when the decays happen just above the detector . </S>",
    "<S> note that even if the sources produce only muon and electron neutrinos by charged pion decays , due to neutrino oscillations an equal admixture of electron , muon and tau neutrinos would be expected upon arrival on earth . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds obtained for the tau neutrinos should hence apply to all neutrino flavors . </S>",
    "<S> the present bounds are shown in fig .  6 @xcite and the best sensitivity to @xmath56 is around @xmath57  ev , just where the gzk neutrinos produced in the photopion interactions of the cr protons are expected ( grey region in the plot ) </S>",
    "<S> . the sensitivity of the auger instrument will steadily approach the relevant level of fluxes ( although if crs are mostly heavy , that prediction moves down significantly ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally there have also been some relevant anisotropy studies at lower energies , around the eev . </S>",
    "<S> being in the southern hemisphere , the auger observatory has a privileged view towards the galactic centre ( gc ) , which passes at just @xmath58 from the zenith at the site . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed to test claims from previous work indicating possible excess fluxes from directions near it . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the agasa collaboration found a 4.5@xmath32 excess ( @xmath59 ) in a @xmath60 radius region for the energy range @xmath57@xmath61  ev , while for the same region and energies auger data led to @xmath62 @xcite , a result inconsistent with a large excess . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , an excess reported by the sugar collaboration in a @xmath63 region slightly displaced from the gc was not confirmed by auger . a map of overdensity significances on @xmath63 radius windows in the region around the gc is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 7 , together with the regions were the agasa and sugar excesses were reported . </S>",
    "<S> the excesses present in this map are consistent with the expectations from fluctuations of an isotropic distribution .     </S>",
    "<S> summary of auger 95% cl upper bounds on the amplitude of a dipolar modulation in right ascension and results from previous experiments . ]     </S>",
    "<S> summary of auger 95% cl upper bounds on the amplitude of a dipolar modulation in right ascension and results from previous experiments . ]    </S>",
    "<S> another result from the agasa collaboration indicated the presence of a modulation in the right ascension distribution of the events , with 4% amplitude at eev energies . </S>",
    "<S> the search for a dipolar amplitude of this kind in data from the auger observatory gave negative results , allowing to set an upper bound on the amplitude of 1.4% at 95% cl @xcite , contradicting the previous finding . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of modulations could arise from the diffusion of galactic crs out of the galaxy , and their search will allow to set constraints on the galactic / extragalactic transition </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , two enhancements of the auger observatory are being done at present , one extending the field of view of the fd detectors to @xmath64 elevation above the horizon with new telescopes ( heat project ) and the other being an infill of sd and muon detectors in a small part of the array ( amiga project ) . </S>",
    "<S> both developments will allow the observation of showers down into the region of the second knee . </S>"
