    "then we applied the modified sequence shown in fig .",

    "we refer to these experiments as @xmath100 and @xmath104 measurements , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the corresponding integrated moke @xmath100 signals obtained from the difference images @xmath79 , @xmath83 , and @xmath80 as a function of the measurement field @xmath99 is shown in fig .  [ fig : me - re](a ) and referred to as @xmath110 ( full blue squares ) , @xmath111 ( full red circles ) , and @xmath112 ( full green triangles ) , respectively .",
    "we again determined the magnetization orientation @xmath51 in a macrospin approximation , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : me - re](b ) .",
    "the corresponding amr @xmath104 curves simultaneously measured with the kerr images at the points @xmath74 and @xmath76 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : me - re](c ) by full blue squares and full green triangles and referred to as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also included the integrated moke @xmath11 and amr @xmath65 data recorded as a function of the external magnetic field at constant @xmath58{v}$ ] and @xmath102{v}$ ] as open gray squares [ denoted as @xmath101 and @xmath107 in figs .",
    "[ fig : me - re](a ) and ( c ) , respectively ] and open gray triangles ( @xmath103 and @xmath108 ) , respectively .    using the @xmath110 and @xmath112 curves [ fig .",

    "the amr curves thus calculated for @xmath105 and @xmath106 are displayed by the solid blue and green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : me - re](c ) , respectively .",
    "evidently , the measurement and simulation for both @xmath105 and @xmath106 are in very good agreement , with the exception of a narrow region around @xmath43 , where the macrospin model fails to adequately describe the experiment , in full consistency with the above findings for @xmath11 and @xmath65 measurements ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : mh_rh ] ) . therefore , except for a small magnetic - field range close to @xmath43 we can describe the voltage - induced magnetization changes in very good approximation in a simple macrospin model .    as we now have demonstrated the validity of the macrospin approach also for the description of @xmath100 and @xmath104 measurements , we can consistently model the evolution of the magnetization orientation as a function of the voltage @xmath4 and the external magnetic field @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : me - re ] ) .",
    "we start the discussion with the evolution of @xmath110 [ full blue squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : me - re](a ) ] , which coincides with the @xmath11 loop recorded at @xmath57{v}$ ] . the corresponding macrospin magnetization orientation @xmath113 is initially aligned along @xmath30 for large negative external magnetic field [ full blue squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : me - re](b ) ] , continuously rotates to @xmath114 with increasing magnetic field strength , then abruptly switches into a direction close to @xmath115 at the magnetic coercive field , and then continuously rotates towards @xmath116 , the orientation of the external magnetic field . for external magnetic measurement fields @xmath117{mt}$ ] , the influence of the zeeman contribution to the total free energy density in the film plane @xmath118 decreases with decreasing absolute value of the external magnetic field , which results in an increasingly dominating magnetoelastic anisotropy contribution",
    "hence , the magnetization orientation can not be modified at @xmath70{mt}$ ] by application of @xmath4 and can be increasingly rotated to about @xmath119 at @xmath120{mt}$ ] by changing @xmath57{v}\\rightarrow\\unit[-30]{v}$ ] [ @xmath121{mt}\\right)\\approx165^{\\circ}$ ] and @xmath122{mt}\\right)\\approx115^{\\circ}$ ] ] . in this magnetic field range ,",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 fully coincide ( @xmath123 ) , i.e. , the voltage - induced magnetization reorientation is fully reversible .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this implies a continuous and reversible magnetization rotation at zero external magnetic field , solely via application of appropriate voltages @xmath4 to the piezoelectric actuator . in the second field range @xmath124{mt}\\lesssim\\mu_{0}h_{\\mathrm{meas}}\\lesssim\\unit[8]{mt}$ ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : me - re ] , the angular range within which the magnetization orientation can be rotated by changing @xmath57{v}\\rightarrow\\unit[-30]{v}$ ] continuously increases , but the magnetization reorientation is not reversible , since @xmath125 .",
    "this observation can also be consistently understood in a macrospin model . here ,",
    "@xmath70{mt}$ ] yields @xmath126 antiparallel to @xmath95{mt}$ ] aligned along @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath126 resides in a local minimum of @xmath29 at @xmath57{v}$ ] and thus in a metastable state . sweeping @xmath4 from @xmath102{v}$ ] to @xmath26{v}$ ]",
    "yields @xmath127 aligned along the global minimum of @xmath29 . however , upon increasing the voltage back to @xmath102{v}$ ] , the magnetization does not rotate back in the same way , but evolves into the global minimum of @xmath29 close to @xmath116 ( for details of the quantitative evolution of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath4 , see ref .  ) .",
    "therefore , the voltage sweep @xmath57{v}\\rightarrow\\unit[-30]{v}\\rightarrow\\unit[+30]{v}$ ] results in an irreversible magnetization - orientation change with @xmath126 and @xmath128 essentially being antiparallel at @xmath57{v}$ ] .",
    "the third magnetic field range @xmath129{mt}$ ] exceeds @xmath130 for @xmath57{v}$ ] , resulting in a ( nearly ) parallel alignment of @xmath131 and @xmath126 . here",
    ", the evolution of @xmath100 is analogous to the above described for @xmath117{mt}$ ] , i.e. , sweeping @xmath57{v}\\rightarrow\\unit[-30]{v}\\rightarrow\\unit[+30]{v}$ ] rotates @xmath126 to @xmath127 and back to @xmath123 .",
    "the angle of rotation decreases with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "overall , these findings demonstrate that the macrospin model can not only be applied to describe the @xmath11 and @xmath65 measurements , but also to the @xmath100 and @xmath104 measurements  except for a narrow range around the coercive field .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the applicability and limitations of a stoner - wohlfarth type macrospin model for the description of changes in the magnetic configuration and magnetoresistance of ferromagnetic / ferroelectric hybrid systems .",
    "to this end , we investigated the magnetic properties in ni thin film / piezoelectric actuator hybrids using simultaneous spatially resolved moke and integral magnetotransport measurements at room temperature . using dedicated measurement sequences to suppress strain - induced contributions to the kerr signal , the imaging of the magnetization state both as a function of magnetic field and electrical voltage applied to the piezoelectric actuator becomes possible .",
    "we extract an effective magnetization orientation ( macrospin ) by spatially averaging the kerr images . for experiments both as a function of @xmath41 and of @xmath4",
    ", we find very good agreement between the amr calculated using the macrospin and the measured amr .",
    "our results show that the magnetization continuously reorients by coherent rotation  except for @xmath42 along a magnetically easy direction in a very narrow region around the magnetic coercive field ,",
    "where the magnetization reorientation dominantly evolves via domain nucleation and propagation . taken together , on length scales much larger than the magnetic domain size , a sw type macrospin model for both @xmath11 and @xmath100 adequately describes the corresponding @xmath65 and @xmath104 .",
