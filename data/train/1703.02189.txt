    "small samples of ultra - cold atoms trapped in external potentials are shaping up to become paradigmatic systems for exploring the fundamental building blocks of quantum many - body dynamics @xcite . while in the weakly interacting regime samples with more than five atoms are well described by a mean - field approach  @xcite ,",

    "one important ingredient in this quest is the development of high - fidelity quantum engineering techniques .",

    "it is therefore sensible to start the development with systems with only a small number of particles and later generalize the developed tools to larger systems .",
    "one of techniques which allow for high - fidelity state preparation in external potentials is spatial adiabatic passage ( sap )  @xcite .",
    "it is an analogue to the well - known stirap technique in atomic physics  @xcite and utilizes the existence of a specific `` dark '' eigenstate to coherently transfer single particles between two localized spatial states  @xcite .",
    "compared to stirap , the sap setting can possess a larger variety of degrees of freedom , which has in recent years allowed to extend the technique to multiple dimensions  @xcite , angular momentum states  @xcite , non - linear systems  @xcite and interacting particles  @xcite .    in this work we will extend the previous developments on interacting systems and show that the typical control that exists in ultracold atom experiments can be used to devise techniques based on sap for the engineering of specific many particle states .",
    "for this we will investigate the possibility of creating a single particle source from two- and three - particle samples .",

    "the hamiltonian of such three - level system can then be written as @xmath9 where the @xmath10 are the coupling frequencies between the states @xmath11 and @xmath12 which depend on the distance between the traps @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",

    ", with zero eigenvalue , which only has contributions from the traps on the left and on the right    @xmath15    sap then consists in following the dark state and transferring a particle from the left trap to the right by adiabatically changing @xmath16 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "this requires to change the relative coupling strengths between the traps , which can be done by approaching and separating individual pairs .",
    "the movement sequence is famously counter - intuitive because the right and the middle traps , which are both empty , approach each other before the left trap starts moving . since the process does not depend on the exact form of the positioning sequence , it is robust to experimental uncertainties .",

    "higher bands correspond to states where at least one of the atoms is in an excited trap state . for those intermediate interaction strengths where the second band remains isolated from the other two bands",

    "the two particles are repulsively bound and effectively behave like a single particle  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore clear that all single particle protocols transfer directly to this situation , and in particular it is straightforward to engineer a two particle noon state by changing @xmath16 from @xmath17 to @xmath31 .",
    "this leaves the system in the state @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 denoting a state with two particles in the left and in the right trap respectively .",
    "noon states are maximally entangled and are important in quantum engineering and quantum metrology  @xcite , as they allow for phase measurements that can reach the fundamental heisenberg limit  @xcite .",
    "in the following we will discuss a process based on sap which is not a straightforward generalization of a single particle protocol , but which allows to split an initial many - particle state in a controlled manner .      to demonstrate the principle of the process ,",
    "let us initially assume that the left trap contains two particles only , and that the target state of the process has one particle in the left and the other in the right trap @xmath35    due to the atomic interactions , the initial and the final state have different energies and are in different energy bands . to make the desired coupling possible , it will therefore be necessary to match the energies and compensate for the absence of the interaction energy in the final state by adjusting the energies of the traps .",
    "this can be done in a time - independent manner by raising the energies of the middle and the right traps by @xmath36 ( or lowering in the case of attractive interactions ) , which ensures resonance between states @xmath33 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",

    "the total number of particles in the @xmath58-th trap is therefore @xmath65 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath66 and the total number of particles in the @xmath57-th band is @xmath67 with eigenvalues @xmath68 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    starting with a cloud of @xmath19 particles initially located in the left trap , we will show in this section that it is possible to separate exactly @xmath90 particles out of it .",
    "while the preparation of such an initial state is by today still experimentally challenging , recent progress in this direction has shown that this can be done for a wide range of particle numbers  @xcite .",
    "we will consider first the case where after the sap dynamics exactly @xmath90 particles remain in the left trap , and later consider the case where exactly @xmath90 particles are separated into the right trap .",

    "for the first case the initial and the target state are given by @xmath91 and the degeneracy conditions in eqs.([eq : totenergyfocklowest][eq : degen ] ) , lead to a simple formula for the trap lift @xmath92 it is important to note that this formula implies that it is not necessary to know the initial number of particles , @xmath19 , to keep the well defined number @xmath90 of particles in the left trap , as @xmath93 only depends on @xmath90 .",

    "if we consider the separation process which transfers a finite number of particles out of the original trap @xmath98 the lift required by eqs.([eq : totenergyfocklowest][eq : degen ] ) is now given by @xmath99 and depends only on the number of separated particles @xmath100 . while this is a complication , for @xmath101 the lift guarantees that the sap triplet is always energetically isolated from other fock states in the repulsive regime .",

    "while there are multiple level crossings visible in the attractive interaction regime , the energy of the sap triplet is the lowest for any repulsive value of @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to a broad plateau in which the separation process gives high fidelities .",
    "increasing the number of particles further leads to a denser and denser spectrum , but the sap band remains the lowest , and therefore isolated , over the full repulsive interacting range , allowing the separation process for a single particle in principle to work for all possible initial particle numbers .",
    "it is worth noting though that the changes in the tunnling strengths between the traps during the dynamics of the sap process results in non - zero bands widths and therefore potential overlaps in denser spectra .",
    "this can lead to transitions out of the sap triplet that lower the process fidelity .",
    "while in principle the bands can be kept arbitrarily narrow by decreasing the minimum approach distance between the traps , this would come at the price of having to increase the total time of the process , which is highly undesirable .",
    "it is therefore important to study the process in experimentally - realistic settings .",
    "while truncated harmonic potentials are very convenient for theoretical studies as they guarantee fulfilment of the resonance condition , they are experimentally unrealistic . we will therefore in the following examine a setup using radio - frequency ( rf ) traps to show that the process discussed above is viable as a quantum engineering technique .",

    "the robustness of the sap protocol is discussed in more details in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the model we use to describe the rf traps is only valid when the rfs used are sufficiently far from each other  @xcite .",
    "when the frequencies come too close , the resulting potential becomes discontinuous and does no longer describe the experimental situation .",
    "this limitation has been taken into account in our simulations by ensuring that the closest approach of two frequencies leads to a discontinuity smaller than @xmath142 , which has a negligible effect on the dynamics . furthermore , lowering the ground state energy of the left trap requires to adjust the change of the rfs @xmath143 and @xmath144 . while this has an effect on the middle trap , it is also very small ( on the order of @xmath145 ) and therefore has also no real effect on the process fidelity .",
    "let us finally discuss the limits of the proposed protocol .",
    "since for increasing numbers of particles the energy spectrum becomes more fragmented , it will be harder and harder to keep the system within the sap triplet . to quantify the limit we determine the size of the maximum energy gap , @xmath146 , between the sap triplet and the neighboring bands as a function of the initial and final number of particles in the left trap over the whole range of repulsive interactions .",
    "in addition we define the value of the interaction strength corresponding to this maximal energy gap , @xmath147 , and the distance between the two points at which the sap triplet crosses other bands , @xmath148 ( see fig .  [",

    "since at the point @xmath147 the process works best , it gives a good insight for its limits : 1 ) @xmath146 quantifies how hard it is to follow the sap state and 2 ) @xmath148 indicates how fragmented the region , in which a high fidelity process can be expected , has become .",
    "the results reveal that the value of @xmath146 does not depend on the initial number of particles @xmath19 , but only on the numbers of particles that are to be moved out of the trap , @xmath100 .",
    "this can be easily understood by considering the structure of the energy spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : es_3qho_3p_focken ] ) . the energy band of each fock state increases linearly with the interaction energy , intersecting @xmath81 at points that correspond to combinations of the excited trap eigenstates .",
    "the slope then depends on the number of particles in the right and the middle traps and it is easy to see that the @xmath149 energy band has the smallest slope , the @xmath150 has the second smallest slope , etc . with increasing @xmath100 one needs , of course , to include more energy levels in the model to account for all intersections , but the structure does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath148 rapidly decrease with increasing @xmath100 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] we show our figures of merit .",
    "from there one can estimate that a realistic upper limit on @xmath100 is on the order of 10 particles , independent on the initial number of particles .",
    "thus , for any @xmath19 , by using , for example , feshbach resonance  @xcite , one can tune the interaction energy to access the region where the particle separation protocol is the easiest .",
    "in this work we have proposed a protocol based on the spatial adiabatic passage technique that allows to divide a sample of interacting particles in a controlled way .",
    "the technique is based on engineering a quasi - three level system by raising or lowering the energies of some of the traps and allowing for an adiabatic transition between initial and target states .",
    "we have explicitly examined the cases @xmath151 for a two - particle system and @xmath152 for a three - particle system and shown that the sap protocol results in high - fidelities over large ranges of interaction energies .",
    "the regions where the protocol fails can be found from the level crossings present in the spectrum of a bose  hubbard model .",
