    "arp  220 ( ic 4553/4 ; ugc 9913 ; iras 15327 + 2340 ) has an infrared luminosity of @xmath12  l@xmath13 , as determined from iras @xmath14  @xmath15 m observations ( soifer et al .  1984 ) , and therefore is classified as an ulirg .",
    "at a distance of @xmath16  mpc ( h@xmath17  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 ) , arp  220 is characterized in the optical by tidal tails interpreted as the signature of a merging process ( surace , sanders & evans 2000 ) .",
    "the large visual extinction toward arp 220 , which could be a@xmath18 mag @xcite , precludes the observations of the nuclear regions at optical and even at infrared frequencies .",
    "radio frequency observations do not suffer from dust extinction , providing a powerful tool to investigate the kinematics , morphology and physical properties of the gas in the dust - obscured regions of arp 220 .",
    "radio observations reveal a double - nucleus system separated by @xmath191@xmath20 ( @xmath21  pc ) as observed in co and hi @xcite .",
    "the existence of multiple luminous radio supernovae ( rsn ) in the nuclear regions of arp 220 suggests that it is mainly starburst - powered @xcite",
    ". however , compact oh maser and x - rays emission suggest the presence of agn activity in the w nucleus @xcite .",
    "high angular resolution ( @xmath22 ) co observations carried out by @xcite suggest that the two nuclei are counter - rotating with respect to each other and are embedded in a kiloparsec - size gas disk , which rotates around their dynamical center .",
    "the counter - rotation is also observed in higher angular resolution ( @xmath23 ) observations of hi absorption @xcite , which show that the rotation is not coplanar and proposed a model in which the two nuclei are in the final state of merging .",
    "counter - rotation may provide the mechanism to get rid of angular momentum , a condition for the two nuclei to merge .",
    "the senses of the velocity gradients , as determined from oh maser emission observations @xcite , are consistent with co molecular emission and hi absorption observations @xcite .",
    "arp  220 is the most distant system from which radio recombination lines ( rrls ) have been observed @xcite .",
    "vla observations of the centimeter wavelength rrl h92@xmath1 have been reported by @xcite and @xcite with angular resolutions of 4@xmath20 and 1@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "@xcite , using a single dish telescope ( iram 30 m ) , detected the emission of the millimeter wavelength rrls h42@xmath1 , h40@xmath1 , and h31@xmath1 and with the vla established upper limits for the rrls h167@xmath1 and h165@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite constructed a model using three density components of ionized gas in order to reproduce the observed rrl and radio continuum intensities , obtaining a star formation rate ( sfr ) in arp  220 of @xmath24  m@xmath13  yr@xmath10 .",
    "the existence of a high - density component of ionized gas , as deduced from these models , has been interpreted as evidence for recent star formation in arp  220 . in particular",
    ", the rrl h53@xmath1 can be used as a tracer of thermal high - density gas ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) . the star formation in this system",
    "may be supported by multiple starbursts with a high star formation rate .",
    "in this paper we present vla observations of arp  220 in the millimeter regime of the rrl h53@xmath1 ( 7  mm ) as well as the radio continuum at 43  ghz with subarcsecond ( @xmath0 ) angular resolution .",
    "the observations are described in  2 . in section  3 the results obtained from the 43  ghz radio continuum and the rrl",

    "4 the implications of these results are discussed .",
    "the conclusions are presented in   5 .",
    "the rrl h53@xmath1 ( 43  ghz ) was observed with the vla in the c configuration on october 13 and 25 , 2002 .",
    "the flux density scales were determined using observations of j1331 + 305 ( 1.49  jy ) .",
    "the fast - switching mode was used in order to track the phase variations induced by the troposphere using cycles of 230  s on arp  220 and 40  s on the phase reference source j1540 + 147 ( @xmath25  jy ) .",
    "the bandpass response of the instrument is frequency dependent and observations of a bandpass calibrator were required for each frequency window .",
    "this bandpass response was corrected using observations of j1229 + 020 ( @xmath26  jy ) .",
    "five frequency windows , each of these with 15 spectral channels ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath10 each ) , were used to observe the broad rrl .",
    "the total velocity coverage is @xmath191000  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the different frequency windows were centered at 42114.9 , 42135.1 , 42164.9 , 42185.1 and 42214.9  mhz .",
    "the on - source integration time was @xmath192  hrs for each frequency window . to avoid possible phase decorrelation at 7  mm",
    ", the calibration of the data was performed correcting for the phases in a first step and subsequently correcting for both amplitude and phase .",
    "the spectral line data were further calibrated by applying the solutions obtained from the self - calibration performed on the continuum channel ( which contains the average of the central 75% of the bandpass ) of each frequency window .",
    "the spectral line observations of the second day were not combined with those of the first day since the variable content of water vapor in the troposphere caused decorrelation of phases in the second and third frequency windows . a critical step in the reduction of the data is to determine the bandpass shape by normalizing the bandpass using the channel 0 data .",
    "five line images , one for each frequency window of the first day , were produced using a weighting scheme intermediate between natural and uniform to obtain a circular beam of @xmath0 .",
    "the five line cubes were regridded in frequency and combined into a single line cube in the gipsy environment . the method used to combine different windows",
    "is described by @xcite .",
    "the data were then hanning - smoothed to minimize the gibbs effect and a final velocity resolution of @xmath28  km  s@xmath10 was achieved .",
    "the parameters of the observations are given in table 1 .",
    "the resulting line cube was further processed using imlin from aips to subtract the continuum emission . a first order polynomial fit was used for the line - free channels , two on the low - velocity edge and five on the high velocity - edge of the bandpass .",
    "previous arp 220 observations of the rrl h42@xmath1 @xcite , co(2 - 1 ) emission line @xcite and hi absorption @xcite , show that the full width at zero intensity expected for the h53@xmath1 line is in the range from @xmath29 to @xmath30  km  s@xmath10 .",

    "the smaller estimates obtained from the h53@xmath1 line and oh observations are explained if the molecular co and neutral hi gas are distributed over a larger region compared to the ionized gas . in the direction of the w component ,",

    "<S> we present high angular resolution ( @xmath0 ) observations made with the very large array ( vla ) of the radio recombination line ( rrl ) h53@xmath1 and radio continuum emission at 43  ghz from the ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) arp  220 . </S>",
    "<S> the 43  ghz continuum emission shows a compact structure ( @xmath2 ) with two peaks separated by @xmath3 , the east ( e ) and west ( w ) components , that correspond to each galactic nucleus of the merger . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral indices for both the e and w components , using radio continuum images at 8.3 and 43  ghz are typical of synchrotron emission ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our 43 ghz continuum and h53@xmath1 line observations confirm the flux densities predicted by the models proposed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement with the models implies the presence of high - density ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) compact hii regions ( @xmath7  pc ) in arp  220 . the integrated h53@xmath1 line emission is stronger toward the non - thermal radio continuum peaks , which are also coincident with the peaks of molecular emission of the h@xmath8co . </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence between the integrated h53@xmath1 and the h@xmath8co maser line emission suggests that the recent star forming regions , traced by the high density gas , are located mainly in regions that are close to the two radio continuum peaks . </S>",
    "<S> a velocity gradient of @xmath9  km  s@xmath10  pc@xmath10 in the h53@xmath1 rrl is observed toward the e component and a second velocity gradient of @xmath11  km  s@xmath10  pc@xmath10 is detected toward the w component . </S>",
    "<S> the orientations of these velocity gradients are in agreement with previous co , hi and oh observations . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the high - density ionized gas traced by the h53@xmath1 line are consistent with two counter rotating disks as suggested by the co and hi observations . </S>"
