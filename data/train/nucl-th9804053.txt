    "the near threshold @xmath6 reaction with @xmath7 has long attracted a lot of interest , mainly because of the possibility of using this reaction to resolve the debates@xcite over the structure of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "most of the earlier theoretical investigations@xcite neglected the initial strong @xmath8 interactions .",
    "it was first demonstrated by siegel and saghai@xcite that the initial @xmath8 interactions can drastically change the predicted capture rates and thus can significantly alter the interpretation of the data . with the phenomenological separable potentials ,",
    "they , however , needed an about @xmath9 deviation of the coupling constants from the su(3 ) values to obtain an accurate description of the data .",
    "obviously , the progress can be made only when the initial strong interactions and the photoproduction amplitudes are consistently described within the same theoretical framework .",
    "for investigating the low energy processes involving strange hadrons , such as the processes considered in this work , it is now generally believed that the best starting point is the effective chiral lagrangian with su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the most developed approach in this direction is chiral perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "such an approach , however , becomes powerless in facing the @xmath0 meson - baryon interactions because of the formation of a resonance just below the @xmath8 threshold . an alternative nonperturbative chiral approach was first developed by kaiser , siegel and weise@xcite .",
    "the essential idea is to define the meson - baryon potentials by the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian and sum a subseries of the chiral expansion by solving a coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "they consider the lowest order and next to lowest order chiral lagrangians , and implemented suitable form factors to make the resulting meson - baryon potentials of finite range such that the loops become convergent .",
    "the range parameters of form factors and some of the second order chiral lagrangians are fitted to the data .",
    "this unitary coupled - channel approach generates dynamically the @xmath5 resonance as a quasibound meson baryon state , and reproduces the low energy data for @xmath10 elastic and inelastic channels .",
    "the generation of the @xmath11(1405 ) resonance is actually not a merit of the chiral lagrangians since it can be obtained in a suitable coupled channel k matrix approach , which would implement unitarity in the amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the merit of the chiral lagrangians is that they can provide an expansion for this k matrix consistent with chiral symmetry and its breaking in the different strangeness channels , @xmath12,1,@xmath131 .",
    "the extension of the work of @xcite to the @xmath140,1 channels is done in ref .",
    "particularly , when working in the s=0 sector , @xmath15 and coupled channels , the @xmath16 resonance is also generated dynamically .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath4 and k photoproduction processes in the s=0 channels were also studied in a similar approach , and with a few more parameters a global reproduction of the strong and electromagnetic cross sections was obtained .",
    "the work of @xcite was inspired by ref.@xcite , but followed closely the approach developed in the study of the s - wave meson - meson scattering of ref.@xcite .",
    "starting with a coupled - channel equation based on the lowest order chiral lagrangian , it was found that the off shell effects in the vertices can be absorbed in coupling constants renormalization .",
    "hence , only the on - shell part of the vertices needed to be considered .",
    "the loop integrals were regularized by means of a cut off , rather than using a form factor as done in @xcite , which allows one to keep the chiral logarithms .",
    "the resulting coupled - channel equation is similar to that of ref.@xcite .",
    "another major step taken in ref.@xcite was to include the @xmath4 and @xmath17 channels in order to have exact su(3 ) symmetry when the mass differences among the members of each octet , mesonic or baryonic , are neglected .",
    "both channels are not opened at low energies and the loop integrations involving these two channels only contribute to the real part of the amplitudes .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath17 channels was found to have negligible effects , but the @xmath4 channels were found numerically important .",
    "the approach of @xcite turns out to be more economical because with the use of only one cut off parameter and the input of the lowest order lagrangian one can reproduce fairly well all the low energy data in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath4 meson loops only provide a real part to the amplitudes , allows the effect of these channels to be effectively taken into account by means of the parameters of the second order lagrangians , as done in @xcite , provided one is not too close to the thresholds of these channels .",
    "conversely , the effects of the second order lagrangian can be effectively incorporated by means of a suitable cut off in @xcite , much as it happened in the study of the scalar sector in the meson - meson interaction in @xcite .",
    "the physics contained in the approaches of @xcite is basically the same , in spite of the different inputs and treatment of the scattering equations , and the results are remarkably similar .",
    "however , it is not clear that this simple approach can be extended to the @xmath12 and @xmath18 sectors because higher order counterterms , which can not be accounted for by means of just one cut off , could appear .",
    "preliminary results for the meson - baryon interaction @xcite also point in the same direction .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the unitary coupled channel chiral approach of @xcite in order to investigate the @xmath19 reactions .",
    "our main objective is to investigate whether the data for these reactions can also be well described with the parameters fixed by the su(3 ) chiral symmetry and hence can provide us with an additional support to the interpretation of the @xmath5 as a quasi - bound meson - baryon state with @xmath0 .    in section",
    "ii , we present a derivation of the approach @xcite within a well - defined formulation of relativistic quantum field theory . this will allow us to clearly establish the rules by which the approximations were introduced in solving the problem .",
    "these rules then allow us to easily derive in section iii the @xmath6 amplitude that is consistent with the model of ref.@xcite .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in section iv .",
    "the approaches followed in refs.@xcite were developed by implementing some physical considerations of chiral symmetry into a postulated coupled - channel scattering equation . to extend the model of ref.@xcite to investigate @xmath20 reactions ,",
    "it is useful to establish its derivation from a well - defined formulation of relativistic quantum field theory .    within the relativistic quantum field theory@xcite",
    ", the s - matrix for the reactions we are considering can be defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denote either a meson - baryon(@xmath23 ) channel or a photon - hyperon(@xmath24 ) channel , and @xmath25 is the total four - momentum of the system .",
    "the scattering amplitude is defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote respectively the mass and energy of the baryon , @xmath29 the energy of the meson .",
    "here we have defined @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dirac spinor and the invariant amplitude @xmath32 is defined by a bethe - salpeter equation(see , for example , the derivation in ref.@xcite ) . in momentum - space , it takes the following form @xmath33 where @xmath34 s are the meson momenta , @xmath35 is the total momentum of the system , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the masses of the baryon and meson in the intermediate channel @xmath38 . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we present formulae in the center of mass system with @xmath39 .",
    "the driving term in eq.(4 ) is the sum of all two - particle irreducible amplitudes that can be generated from the chosen su(3 ) effective chiral lagrangian by using the standard perturbation theory .",
    "to lowest order these amplitudes are @xmath40 where @xmath41 are su(3 ) coupling constants which can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath42 is the pion decay constant .    the scattering equation employed in @xcite can now be obtained from eq.(4 ) by using a simplification : only the positive energy component of the fermion propagator is kept .",
    "explicitly , the rule is to use the following substitution in evaluating any loop - integration : @xmath43 substituting eq.(6 ) into eq.(4 ) and integrating out the time component @xmath44 , it is straightforward to use the definitions eqs.(3 ) and ( 5 ) to obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 in the near threshold region , one can use the heavy - baryon approximation to reduce the potential into a spin - independent s - wave interaction @xmath47    with the definitions eqs.(1)-(3 ) for the s - matrix and the s - wave spin - independent interaction eq.(9 ) , it is straightforward to obtain the following expression of the total cross section @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the sum and average over the final and inital spin indices .",
    "eqs.(7 ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) define precisely the model used in @xcite .    in ref.@xcite eq.(7 )",
    "is solved by evaluating the potential @xmath50 on - shell and hence it factors out of the integral .",
    "it was argued that the off - shell effects are in the renormalization of coupling constants and can be neglected in the calculation using physical masses and coupling constants .",
    "eq.(7 ) then becomes a simple algebraic equation which can be solved easily .",
    "a cutoff @xmath51 mev is found to be needed to regularize the integration in eq.(7 ) and give a good description of all of the existing @xmath0 meson - nucleon reactions near threshold .",
    "this factorization technique is similar to that first introduced@xcite in the study of meson - meson scattering using chiral lagrangians , where the off - shell contributions can be absorbed into the renormalization of masses and coupling constants .",
    "we follow here in the @xmath0 sector similar steps as done in @xcite in the s=0 sector , but starting from a relativistic formulation of the problem .",

    "the derivation is straightforward .",
    "here we only note that the integration over the meson - exchange term ( fig.2c ) can have two meson pole contributions , and replacing the baryon propagators in eqs.(13)-(14 ) by the projected propagator of eq.(6 ) makes our photoproduction matrix elements different from the usual born terms used in refs.@xcite .",
    "in addition , we neglect terms of order of @xmath73 or @xmath74 and higher , typical of the heavy baryon approximation .",
    "these approximations are required for consistency with the construction of the coupled - channel potential , eq.(9 ) , within the approach of @xcite .",

    "this simplicity is of course due to our use of the baryon propagator shown in eq.(6 ) to evaluate the matrix elements of eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) , and the s - wave nature of the meson - baryon channels within the approach followed in @xcite .",
    "consequently , the total amplitude can be calculated by using eqs.(19)-(22 ) .",

    "these two parameters were determined in ref.@xcite and hence the calculations based on eqs.(19)-(22 ) do not have any adjustable parameters .    we have calculated the branching ratios defined by @xmath94 where @xmath95 and the total cross sections are defined in eq.(10 ) . in the calculation of the denominator of eq.(24 ) all @xmath0 meson - baryon channels within the approach of @xcite are included .",

    "our results calculated with and without including the coupled - channel effects are listed in table ii and compared with the data @xcite .",
    "we see that with no initial meson - baryon interactions ( first row in table ii ) , the @xmath97 production is very weak and the predicted ratio between two production rates is an order of magnitude larger than the data .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of siegel and saghai@xcite .",

    "it is sufficient to just consider the first two terms of eq.(19 ) .",
    "they can be cast into a form employed by siegel and saghai@xcite , if we factor out the photoproduction amplitude @xmath100 and evaluate it at the on - shell momenta . with this approximation , we have ( obvious variables are omitted here ) @xmath101_{mb , k^-p } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all quantites in the above equation are evaluated at on - shell momenta .",

    ", we list these matrix elements as well as the values of the on - shell photoproduction amplitudes @xmath104 .",
    "we see that the total amplitude , defined by eq.(25 ) in this estimate , involves a nontrival interplay between the strong transitions and electromagnetic transitions .",
    "in particular , the large enhancement of the @xmath97 production by the coupled - channel effects can be understood from the second column of table iii .",
    "we see that @xmath105 and @xmath106 are a factor of about 3 larger than @xmath107 , while their strong transition strengths in column 3 are comparable in magnitude . consequently , the branching ratio for @xmath97 is greatly enhanced when the @xmath108 channels are included .",
    "this is verified in our exact calculations based on eqs.(19)-(20 ) , as can be seen in the second row of table iv .",
    "we see that the branching ratio for @xmath97 production is increased from 0.14 to 1.28 when the @xmath109 and @xmath110 channels are included . from column 1 of table iii",
    ", we also expect that the effect of @xmath108 channels on the @xmath98 production is much less , mainly because the photoproduction amplitudes for the first three channels are comparable and the contributions from @xmath109 and @xmath110 channels have opposite signs .",
    "as shown in the first row of table iv , the coupling with the @xmath108 channels can lower the production rate only from 2.47 to 1.56 .",
    "neverthelesss , it is instrumental in bringing our prediction closer to the experimental value @xmath111 .",
    "we further notice that the reduction from 2.47 to 1.33 when the @xmath112 channel is included ( first row of table iv ) is largely due to the cancellation caused by the opposite signs of the imaginary parts of @xmath102 $ ] , as seen in the third column of table iii .",
    "note that the relative signs between the contributions from different channels are determined not only by the meson charges(@xmath61 ) but also by the chiral su(3 ) parameters listed in table i. thus , the coupled - channel effects are crucial in testing the chiral su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the effect due to the @xmath113 channel is very weak because their strong transition is an order of magnitude smaller than others , as can be seen in the third column of table iii .",
    "we now turn to illustrating several important features of our approach .",
    "the exact treatment of meson propagators in fig.2c leads to a contribution(@xmath114 in eq.(19 ) ) from a second pole . by comparing the first two rows in table v",
    ", we see that this second pole term can change the @xmath97 branching ratio by about 40@xmath99 , but much less for @xmath98 .",
    "consequently , the the predicted ratio becomes closer to the experimental value .",
    "an important finding of ref.@xcite was that the coupling with the @xmath4 channels is essential in obtaining a good agreement with all of the existing @xmath0 meson - baryon reaction data when using only the lowest order lagrangian as input .",
    "the influence of this coupling on our predictions is also significant .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the second and third rows in table v. we see that the predicted branching ratio for @xmath98 production is increased by about 60 @xmath99 if the @xmath4 channels are omitted in the calculation of the strong amplitudes @xmath115 appearing in eq.(19 ) .",
    "it is clear that including the @xmath4 channels is also crucial in using this reaction to test the chiral su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "we note that the @xmath4 channels were omitted in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite . at the same time the couplings in that work",
    "had to be substantially changed with respect to their su(3 ) values in order to obtain a good fit to the data .",
    "in retrospective we can say that what the explicit breaking of su(3 ) symmetry does in reality is to restore it after it has been broken by the omission of the @xmath4 channels .",
    "finally , we note that the strong meson - baryon - baryon vertex in each of the photoproduction amplitudes should in principle have a form factor because hadrons are composite particles . to see how our results will be changed when this is taken into account",
    ", we perform a calculation including a monopole form factor with typical cut off , @xmath116 , values of 1.2 and 1 gev .",
    "the introduction of this cut off reduces the ratio @xmath117 to values in better agreement with the data .",
    "changes of @xmath116 from 1 to 1.2 gev introduce only corrections of the order of 10% .",
    "the results obtained with @xmath118 gev , a value which is commonly accepted , roughly agree with the data within experimental errors , which are of order of 20% . if one compares with the central values of the experimental branching ratios , our results are on the upper edge of the @xmath119 ratio while those for @xmath120 are on the lower edge",
    ". looked at it in the context that the coupled channels and unitarization have reduced the ratio @xmath117 by a factor 14 , differences of the order of 1020 % are not so significative .",
    "yet , the fact that a better agreement with the central values of the data is obtained in @xcite , at the price of fitting parameters , indicates that there is probably still room in the model used here for moderate breakings of su(3 ) beyond those implemented by the different masses of the particles .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have extended the approach of @xcite to make predictions for the branching ratios for the @xmath121 reactions near the threshold .",
    "all coupling constants are consistent with the chiral su(3 ) symmetry . with only two parameters , which were fixed in the study of @xmath0 meson - baryon reactions ,",
    "our predictions are close to the data , in particular the ratio between two branching ratios . in our approach , neither the meson - baryon nor the photoproduction mechanisms involve the explicit consideration of excited hyperon states since the @xmath5 resonance , which plays a key role in these reactions , is generated dynamically .",
    "our results therefore strengthen the interpretation of the @xmath5 as a quasi - bound meson - baryon system with @xmath0 , as already supported by the study of the strong interactions in @xcite .",
    "this does not exclude a seed of a more complicated intrinsic quark substructure , but the strong coupling to the meson baryon channels imposed by the unitarization reinforces the meson baryon component and allows this resonance to approximately qualify as a meson baryon quasibound state much as it happens for the resonances in the scalar meson - meson sector @xcite    * acknowledgements *    one of the authors t .- s .",
