    "the latter is known as irreversible diffusion processes @xcite . to complete the analysis , we now consider ( @xmath149 ) . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "the dynamics exhibits two different time scales : intra - attractoral dynamics and inter - attractoral dynamics .",
    "the major questions here are ( @xmath153 ) the relative stability of these attractors and ( @xmath154 ) the transition rates between different attractors .",
    "note the unique feature of dynamics on the circle @xmath155 , which is different from one - dimensional @xmath156 , is the possibility of non - gradient , i.e. , no detailed balance .",
    "stationary , reversible diffusion process on @xmath156 has a single global landscape which simultaneously provides answers to both ( @xmath153 ) , e.g. , boltzmann s law , and ( @xmath154 ) via kramers theory @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for stationary diffusion process on @xmath155 .",
    "although the fundamental theorems by freidlin and wentzell have been developed for quite a long time @xcite , their relation to nonequilibrium thermodynamics is still unknown .",
    "the present study , thus , serves an initiation for this interesting problem .    according to freidlin and wentzell @xcite , in the high - dimensional case as well as in the one - dimensional compact manifold",
    ", there are two types of landscapes : the _ local landscape _ underlies a kramers theory - like analysis for a single transition from one basin of attraction to another . the _ global landscape _",
    ", on the other hand , is for the relative stability in nonequilibrium steady state @xcite .",
    "the well - known kramers rate theory states that @xcite the barrier crossing time is exponentially dependent on the barrier height and nearly exponential distributed @xcite when the noise strength tends to zero .",
    "then , putting together all the transition rate constants computed from the kramers theory , one obtains a discrete - state continuous - time markovian chain(in chemistry , this is called discrete chemical kinetics . ) . according to a key theorem in @xcite",
    ", one could then realize that such a markov chain is equilibrium if and only if the local landscapes derived from the freidlin - wentzell local actions in each attractive domain could be continuously pieced together ; the function pieced together is just the global landscape ; this could only be guaranteed with the detailed balance condition .",
    "next , for each single domain ( or basin ) of attraction associated with a stable fixed point , applying the large deviation theory of freidlin and wentzell , one builds a local landscape @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "and then for each pair of neighbouring attractive domains @xmath159 and @xmath160 , one obtains a pair of local transition rates from kramers theory : the transition rate @xmath161 from @xmath159 to @xmath160 is proportional to @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the lowest barrier height of @xmath157 along the boundary with the attractive domain @xmath160 .    this way",
    ", we obtain an emergent , discrete - state markov network with state space @xmath164 and transition rates @xmath165 for non - diagonal elements .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath166 are determined by requiring all its rows summed to zero .",
    "a stationary distribution can then be solved , with @xmath167 satisfying @xmath168 now we are ready for a cricial step : to paste ( reshuffle ) the local landscapes together in order to build the global one .",
    "the reshuffle procedure is somewhat subtle .",
    "there is an illustrative example in @xcite ( also see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . here",
    "we give a simple demonstration in terms of a @xmath169-state markov chain .    in this case",
    ", we have @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 in which the denominator @xmath173 is determined by @xmath174 .",
    "when @xmath5 tends to zero , let @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177 so the reshuffle rule is as follows @xmath178 where @xmath179 means the minimum of the freidlin - wentzell action along the path between the @xmath153-th attractive domain and the position @xmath180 .",
    "the intuitive understanding is that starting from each attractor , and compare their probabilities for arriving at @xmath180 .    in the case of three states , for instance , if @xmath180 is in the first attractive domain , then @xmath181 , @xmath182 if the backward trajectory starting from @xmath180 would arrive at the boundary between the first and second attractive domains , otherwise @xmath183 ; @xmath184 if the backward trajectory starting from @xmath180 would arrive at the boundary between the first and third attractive domains , otherwise @xmath185 .",
    "hence , @xmath186 is continuous , and the global invariant distribution @xmath187 so @xmath188 is the global landscape , which also satisfies the lyapunov property .",
    "furthermore , we know that the emergent markovian chain is in equilibrium , if and only if @xmath189 @xcite , which means @xmath190 , i.e. @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193",
    ". hence the local landscape @xmath157 would be continuously connected at the boundaries in this case .",
    "the above result is a generalization of the celebrated work of kramers @xcite . in kramers theory ,",
    "the underlined nonlinear diffusion process is the atomic dynamics along the reaction coordinate , while the emergent discrete dynamics is exactly the discrete chemical kinetics . for systems with detailed balance , kramers rate constants are consistent with boltzmann s law for conformational probabilities .",
    "however , when detailed balance are not satisfied , we have clearly demonstrated here an essential difference between local and global landscapes : the former is related to individual state - to - state transition , while the latter is associated with a systems long - time dynamics .",
    "their disagreement is the origin of nonequilibrium steady states @xcite .",

    "<S> landscape is one of the key notions in literature on biological processes and physics of complex systems with both deterministic and stochastic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the large deviation theory ( ldt ) provides a possible mathematical basis for the scientists intuition . in terms of freidlin - wentzell s ldt </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss explicitly two issues in singularly perturbed stationary diffusion processes arisen from nonlinear differential equations : ( 1 ) for a process whose corresponding ordinary differential equation has a stable limit cycle , the stationary solution exhibits a clear separation of time scales : an exponential terms and an algebraic prefactor . </S>",
    "<S> the large deviation rate function attains its minimum zero on the entire stable limit cycle , while the leading term of the prefactor is inversely proportional to the velocity of the non - uniform periodic oscillation on the cycle . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) for dynamics with multiple stable fixed points and saddles , there is in general a breakdown of detailed balance among the corresponding attractors . </S>",
    "<S> two landscapes , a local and a global , arise in ldt , and a markov jumping process with cycle flux emerges in the low - noise limit . a local landscape is pertinent to the transition rates between neighboring stable fixed points ; and the global landscape defines a nonequilibrium steady state </S>",
    "<S> . there would be nondifferentiable points in the latter for a stationary dynamics with cycle flux . </S>",
    "<S> ldt serving as the mathematical foundation for emergent landscapes deserves further investigations .    </S>",
