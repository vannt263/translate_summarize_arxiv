    "every day , new evolutions are brought in the biometric field of research .",
    "these evolutions include the proposition of new algorithms with better performances , new approaches ( cancelable biometrics , soft biometrics , ... ) and even new biometric modalities ( like finger knuckle recognition  @xcite , for example ) .",
    "there are many different biometric modalites , each classified among three main families ( even if we can find a more precise topology in the literature ) :    * _ biological _ : recognition based on the analysis of biological data linked to an individual ( e.g. , dna analysis  @xcite , the odor  @xcite , the analysis of the blood of different physiological signals , as well as heart beat or eeg  @xcite ) ; * _ behavioural _ : based on the analysis of an individual behaviour while he is performing a specific task ( e.g. , keystroke dynamics  @xcite , online handwritten signature  @xcite , the way of using the mouse of the computer  @xcite , voice recognition  @xcite , gait dynamics ( way of walking )  @xcite or way of driving  @xcite ) ; * _ morphological _ based on the recognition of different particular physical patterns , which are , for most people , permanent and unique ( e.g. , face recognition  @xcite , fingerprint recognition  @xcite , hand shape recognition  @xcite , or blood vessel  @xcite , ... ) .",
    "nevertheless , there will always be some users for which a biometric modality ( or method applied to this modality ) gives bad results , whereas , they are better in average . these low performances can be implied by different facts : the quality of the capture , the instant of acquisition and the individual itself but they have the same implication ( impostors can be accepted or user need to authenticate themselves several times on the system before being accepted ) .",
    "multibiometrics allow to solve this problem while obtaining better performances ( i.e. , better security by accepting less impostors and better user acceptance by rejecting less genuine users ) and by expecting that errors of the different modalities are not correlated . in this paper",
    ", we propose a generic approach for multibiometric systems .",
    "we can find different types of biometric multimodalites  @xcite .",
    "they use :    1 .",
    "different sensors of the same biometric modality ( i.e. , capacitive or resistive sensors for fingerprint acquisition ) ; 2 .   several different representations for the same capture ( i.e. , use of points of interest or texture for face or fingerprint recognition ) ; 3 .   different biometric modalities ( i.e. , face and fingerprint recognition ) ; 4 .   different instances of the same modality ( i.e. , left and right eye for iris recognition ) ; 5 .   multiple captures ( i.e. , 25 images per second in a video used for face recognition ) ; 6 .",
    "an hybrid system composed of the association of the previous ones .",
    "we are interested in the first four cases in this paper .",
    "our objective is to automatically generate fusion functions which combine the scores provided by different biometric systems in order to obtain the most efficient multibiometrics authentication scheme .        in order to compare different multibiometrics systems ,",
    "we need to present the how to evaluate them .",
    "several works have already done on the evaluation of biometric systems  @xcite .",
    "evaluation is generally realized within three aspects :    * _ performance _ : it has for objective to measure various statistical criteria on the performance of the system ( _ capacity _  @xcite , _ eer _ , _ failure to enroll ( fte ) _ , _ failure to acquire ( fta ) _ , computation time , _ roc _ curves , etc  @xcite ) ; * _ acceptability _ : it gives some information on the individuals _ perception _ , _ opinions _ and _ acceptance _ regarding the system ; * _ security _ : it quantifies how well a biometric system ( algorithms and devices ) can resist to several types of logical and physical attacks such as denial of service ( dos ) attack .    in this paper",
    ", we are only interested in performance evaluation ( because the fusion approach is not modality dependant and perception and security depend on the used modalities ) . the main performance metrics are the following ones :    * _ far ( false acceptance rate ) _ which represents the ratio of impostors accepted by the system ; * _ frr ( false rejection rate ) _ which represents the ratio of genuine users rejected by the system ; * _ eer ( error equal rate ) _ which is the error rate when the system is configured in order to obtain a _",
    "far _ equal to the _ frr _ ; * _ roc ( receiver operating characteristic ) _ curve which plots the _ frr _ depending on the _ far _ and gives an overall overview of system performance ; * _ auc ( area under the curve ) _ which gives the area under the roc curve . in our case ,",
    "smaller is better .",
    "it is a way to globally compare performance of different biometric systems .",
    "we can also present the _ hter _",
    "( half total error rate ) which is the mean between the _ far _ and _ frr _ for a given threshold ( this error rate is interesting when we can not get the _ eer _ ) .",
    "there are several studies on multibiometrics .",
    "the fusion can be operated on different points of the mechanism :    * _ template fusion _ :",
    "the templates captured by different biometric systems are merged together , then the learning process is realized on these new templates  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fusionmodele ] presents this type of fusion .",
    "the fusion process is related to a feature selection in order to determine the most significant patterns to minimize errors . * _ decision fusion _ :",
    "the decision is taken for each of the biometric authentication system , then the final decision is done by fusing the previous ones  @xcite . *",
    "_ rank fusion _ : the decision is done with the help of different ranks of biometric identification systems . the main method is the majority vote  @xcite . * _ score fusion _ : the fusion is realized considering the output of the classifiers .",
    "the figure  [ fig : fusionscores ] presents this type of fusion .",
    "buyssens _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed the interest of biometric fusion for face recognition combining the image in visible and infrared color spaces with convolutional neural networks . in  @xcite , mantalvao and freire",
    "have combined keystroke dynamics with voice recognition , it seems it is the first time that multibiometrics has been done with keystroke dynamics and another biometric modality . in  @xcite ,",
    "hocquet _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated the interest of fusion in keystroke dynamics in order to improve the recognition rates : three different keystroke dynamics functions are used on the same capture .",
    "the sum operator ( consisting in summing the different scores ) seems to be the most powerful approach in the literature .",
    "these fusion architectures are quite simple but powerful .",
    "results can yet be improved ( in term of error rate or computation time ) by using different architectures .",
    "a cascade fusion  @xcite is another interesting approach .",
    "a first test is done , if the user is correctly verified as the attended client or if it is detected as an impostor , the algorithm stops . otherwise , another biometric authentication ( with another capture from another modality )",
    "is proceeded until obtaining a decision of acceptance or rejection , or reaching the end of the cascade .",
    "so , instead of using one decision threshold , each test ( except the last one ) needs two thresholds : one for rejection and one for acceptance .",
    "all scores between these thresholds are considered in an indecision zone .",
    "this mechanism is presented in figure  [ fig : fusioncascade ] .",
    "another advantage of this method is to decrease the verification time by not using all the modalities , they are used only if necessary .",
    "this method has been successfully applied on a multibiometric system using face and fingerprint recognition in a mobile environment ( where acquisition and computation times are important )  @xcite .",
    "another kind of architecture has been proposed : it is a hierarchical fusion scheme  @xcite ( called multiple layers by their authors ) .",
    "_ have presented this method with two different keystroke dynamics methods .",
    "the fusion is done at different steps , and involves different mathematical operations on scores ( sum , weighted sum , product , min , max ) and logical operations decision ( comparison to a threshold , or , and ) on differents templates extracted from the same capture . an extended version to any multibiometric system is presented in figure  [ fig : fusionhierarchique ] . we think our work can be seen as a generalization of this paper .",
    "+ it is also possible to model the distribution of the genuine and impostor matching scores , we talk about _ density - based score fusion_. in  @xcite , scores are modelled with a gaussian mixture model and have been tested on three multibiometric databases involving face , fingerprint , iris and speech modalities .",
    "+ concerning non linear algorithms , support vector machine ( svm ) can also be used in a fusion process .",
    "each score to combine is arranged in a vector and a training set is used to learn the svm model . in  @xcite , the svm fusion to improve face recognition gives slightly better performances than weighted sum . voice and online signature have been fused with svm in  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "arithmetic mean gives best results with noise free data , while svm gives equivalent results with noisy data .      in this paper , we are interested in biometric modality independent _ transformation - based score fusion _",
    "@xcite where the matching scores are first normalized and second combined .",
    "we have previously seen that in this case , arbitrary functions are often used .",
    "our work is based on these various fusion architectures based on score fusion in order to produce a score fusion function automatically generated with genetic programming  @xcite .",
    "+ by the way , the definition of a fusion architecture is still an open issue in the multibiometrics research field  @xcite , because the range of possible fusion configurations is very large . we think that using automatically generated fusion functions can bring a new solution to solve this kind of problems .",
    "in this section , we present all the required information in order to allow other researchers to reproduce our experiment .",
    "as it is well known that results can be highly related to the database , for this study , we have used three different multibiometric databases : the first one is the bssr1  @xcite distributed by the nist  @xcite ( referenced as bssr1 in the paper ) , the second one is a database we have created for this purpose ( referenced as private in the paper ) and the third one is a subset of scores computed with the banca  @xcite database ( referenced as banca in the text .",
    "in fact , banca database is composed of templates .",
    "we have used the scores available in  @xcite ) .",
    "as all these databases are multi - modal , the scores are presented with tuples : the @xmath3__th _ _ tuple of scores is represented as @xmath4 for a database having @xmath5 modalities ( in our case , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the three databases are presented in detail in the following subsections while table  [ tab : databases ] presents a summary of their description .",
    "the bssr1  @xcite database consists of an ensemble of scores sets from different biometric systems . in this study , we are interested in the subset containing the scores of two facial recognition systems and the two scores of a fingerprint recognition system applied to two different fingers for @xmath7 users .",
    "we have @xmath7 tuples of intra - scores ( comparison of the capture of an individual with its model ) and @xmath8 tuples of inter - scores ( comparison of the capture of an individual with the model of another individual ) .",
    "each tuple is composed of 4 scores : @xmath9 , they respectively represent the score of the algorithm a of face recognition , the score of algorithm b of face recognition ( the same face image is used for the two algorithms ) , the score of the fingerprint recognition with left index , the score of fingerprint recognition with right index .",
    "this database has been used several times in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the second database is a chimeric one we have created by combining two public biometric template databases : the ar  @xcite for the facial recognition and the greyc keystroke  @xcite for keystroke dynamics .",
    "+ the ar database is composed of frontal facial images of @xmath10 individuals under different facial expression , illumination conditions or occlusions .",
    "this is a quite difficult database in reason of these specificities .",
    "these images have been taken during two different sessions with @xmath11 captures per session .",
    "the greyc keystroke contains the captures on several session during a two months period involving @xmath12 individuals .",
    "users were asked to type the password `` greyc laboratory '' @xmath13 times on a laptop and @xmath13 times on an usb keyboard by interleaving the typings .",
    "we have selected the first @xmath14 individual of the ar database and we have associated each of these individuals to another one in a subset of the greyc keystroke database having @xmath15 sessions of captures .",
    "we then used the @xmath16 first captures to create the model of each user and the @xmath17 remaining ones to compute the intra and inter scores .",
    "these scores have been computed by using two different methods for the face recognition ( the scores @xmath18 and @xmath19 and three different ones for the keystroke dynamics ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 scores ) .",
    "the face recognition algorithms are based on eigenfaces  @xcite and sift keypoints  @xcite comparisons between images from the model and the capture  @xcite .",
    "keystroke dynamics scores have been computed by using different methods  @xcite based on svm , statistical information and rhythm measures .",
    "the lastest used benchmark is a subset of scores produced by the help of the banca database  @xcite .",
    "the selected scores correspond to the following one labelled : idiap_voice_gmm_auto_scale_25_100_pca.scores for @xmath23 , surrey_face_nc_man_scale_100.scores for @xmath24 , surrey_face_svm_man_scale_0.13.scores for @xmath25 and uc3m_voice_gmm_auto_scale_10_100.scores for @xmath26 .",
    "we have empirically chosen this subset .",
    "g1 set is used as the learning set , while g2 set is used as the validation set .",
    "users from g1 are different than users from g2 .",
    "the main differences between these three benchmarks are :    * the biometric modalities used in bssr1 and banca have better performances than the ones in private ; * the quantity of intra - scores is more important in private ( only one tuple of intra - score per user in bssr1 instead of several in private ) ; * bssr1 and banca are databases of scores ( by the way , we do not know the biometric systems having generated them ) whereas private is a database of templates ( we had to compute the scores ) ; * bssr1 and banca are more adapted to physical access control applications ( i.e. , a building is protected by a multi - modal biometric system ) , while private is more adapted to logical access control ( i.e. , the authentication to a web service is protected by a multi - modal biometric system ) .",
    "[ tab : databases ]    .summary of the different databases used to validate the proposed method [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     this gain is computed as following : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the eer values of the weighted fusion and the generated score fusion function ( the same procedure is used for the auc ) .",
    "better values than the weighted sum are represented in bold .",
    "the eer gives a local performance for one running point ( system configured in order to obtain an far equal to the frr ) , while the auc gives a gives a global performance of the whole system .",
    "these two information are really interesting to use when comparing biometric systems .",
    "figure  [ fig : roc_systemb ] presents the roc curves of the generated programs against the weighted sum .",
    "performance of the initial biometric systems are not represented , because we have already seen that they are worst than the weighted sum ( same remark for the other fusion functions ) .",
    "logarithmic scales are used , because error rates are quite small .",
    "we can see from table  [ tab : res2 ] and figure  [ fig : roc_systemb ] that most of the time , the automatically generated functions with genetic programming give slightly better results than the weighted sum .",
    "these improvements can be local and global and vary between 16% and 59% for the eer and 0.05% and 76% for the area under the curve . when there is no improvement , the results are equal or ( in one case ) slightly inferior .",
    "even if there is some difference between training ( not represented in this paper ) and validating sets , we can not observe overfitting problem .",
    "the bssr1 dataset presents the largest difference of performance between training and validation sets , but , the results are still better than the ones from the state of the art ( and the same problem can be observe with the weighted sum ) . by the way ,",
    "the fitness criterion has never been met , we did not achieve to obtain fusion functions doing no error .",
    "so , the evolution always ended when reaching the @xmath30 generation .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitness ] represents the fitness evolution during all the generations of one genetic programming run on the bssr1 database . a logarithmic scale has been used to give more importance to the low values and track easier the fitness evolution of the best individual of each generation .",
    "we can observe the same kind of results with the other databases .",
    "the fitness convergence appears several generations before the end of the computation .",
    "the worst program of each generation is always very bad which implies that the standard deviation of the fitness is also always quite huge .",
    "this can be explained by the high quantity of mutation probability and the low quantity of good programs kept for the next generation .",
    "when running the experiment several times , we obtain the same convergence value .",
    "we can say that we reach the maximum performance of the system .",
    "the score fusion functions generated by the proposed approach give a slightly better performance than the fusion functions used in the state of the art in multibiometrics .",
    "we can argue that genetic programming is adapted to automatically define score fusion functions returning a score .",
    "the tradeoff of this performance gain is the need of training patterns which are not necessary for @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 ( but this requirement is already present for the weighted sum or the use of an svm ) . by the way ,",
    "this is not really a problem , because we already need training patterns to configure the threshold of decision ( if we do not want to do it empirically ) or if we need to normalize the scores before doing the fusion .",
    "another problem inherent to genetic programming is the complexity of the generated programs .",
    "it is probable that some subtrees could be pruned or simplified without loosing performance .",
    "another trail would be to add regularization parameter to the fitness function ( for example , the number of nodes or the depth of the tree ) .",
    "generated programs would be more readable by an human and quicker to interpret .",
    "figure  [ fig : arbres ] presents a simple generated tree ( depending on the database , they can be more or less complex ) . even if the program is quite short ( comparing to the other generated functions ) , it includes useless code ( e.g. , the subtree @xmath34 could be simplified by @xmath35 ) .",
    "some generated trees include preprocessing steps by not using all the modalities in the terminal set .",
    "genetic programming generated score fusion functions give performance slightly equal or better than genetic algorithm configured weighted sum .",
    "even if computation time is more important than for genetic algorithm , we can think that the gain is not really important between the two methods , but , to obtain these results , genetic programming needed a population ten times smaller and ten times less of generations .",
    "we propose in this paper a new approach for multibiometrics based on the automatic generation of score fusion functions .",
    "we have seen interesting approaches in the state of the art and decided to improve them by automatically generated score fusion programs by the help of genetic programming .",
    "our contribution concerns the designing of multibiometric systems while using a generic approach based on genetic programming ( and is inspired from the state of the art architectures ) .",
    "the proposed method returns a multibiometrics score to be compared with a defined threshold .",
    "the proposed multibiometric system has been heavily tested on three different multibiometric databases .",
    "we obtained great improvements compared to classical fusion functions used in the state of the art .",
    "we hope to have opened a new path in the fusion of biometric systems thanks to genetic programming .",
    "results could surely be improved by using different parameters in the genetic programming engine ( i.e. , more individuals and generations , different range of constants , different functions ,  ) .",
    "it could be interesting to test other performance metrics could be improved by adding quality measures of the capture , and if genetic programming could produce template fusion programs .",
    "the authors would like to thank : the author of pystep  @xcite , the library used during the experiment , for his helpfull help when encoutering problems with it , the authors of the various biometric databases used in this experiment , as well as the french basse - normandie region for its financial support .",
