    "for instance in morse theory , where a smooth real valued function @xmath3 on a smooth manifold @xmath4 is given , such that @xmath5 $ ] contains no critical point of @xmath6 but @xmath7 , the homotopy type of @xmath8-\\infty , f(m)+\\eta])$ ] is given by the homotopy type of @xmath8-\\infty , f(m)-{\\varepsilon}])$ ] , for any @xmath9 with @xmath10 , plus a discrete invariant attached to @xmath6 at @xmath7 , namely the index of @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "in this case the family @xmath11-\\infty , f(m)-{\\varepsilon}]))_{0<{\\varepsilon}\\le \\eta}$ ] has the same fibres , from the differential point of view , and approximates the special set @xmath8-\\infty , f(m)+\\eta])$ ] , from the homotopy type point of view , up to some additional discrete topological invariant .",
    "another instance of this deformation principle can be found in tropical geometry , where a patchwork polynomial embeds a complex curve @xmath0 of the complex torus @xmath12 into a family @xmath13 of complex curves .",
    "this family may be viewed as a curve @xmath14 on the non archimedean valued field @xmath15 of laurent series with exponents in @xmath16 .",
    "then , by a result of mikhalkin and rullgrd ( @xcite and @xcite ) , the amoebas family @xmath17 of @xmath13 has limit ( in the hausdorff metric ) the non archimedean amoeba @xmath18 of @xmath14 .    in the theory of sufficiency of jets",
    "the aim is to approach a smooth map by its family of taylor polynomials up to some sufficient degree depending on the kind of equivalence considered for maps ( right , left , or @xmath19 equivalence ) .",
    "embedding a germ into a convenient deformation is a seminal way of thinking for r. thom that has been successfully achieved in his cobordism theory or in his works on regular stratifications providing regular trivializations .",
    "we could multiply examples in this spirit , old ones as well as recent ones ( from recent developments in general deformation theory itself for instance ) , but in this introduction we will focus only on two specific examples , that will be developed thereafter : the milnor fibration and the lipschitz - killing curvatures .",
    "the first of these two examples is provided by the milnor fibre of a complex singular analytic hypersurface germ @xmath20 we will assume for simplicity that this singularity is an isolated one , that is to say that we will assume that @xmath21 is the only critical value of @xmath6 , at least locally around @xmath22 .",
    "we denote @xmath23 the open ball of radius @xmath24 , centred at @xmath22 of the ambient space depending upon the context .",
    "now , for @xmath25 small enough and @xmath26 , the family @xmath27 is a smooth bundle , with projection @xmath6 , over the punctured disc @xmath28 .",
    "the topological type of a fibre @xmath29 does not depend on the choice of @xmath9 , and the homotopy type of this fibre is the homotopy of a finite cw complex of dimension @xmath30 , the one of a bouquet of @xmath31 spheres @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is called the milnor number of the fibration ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , the special singular fibre @xmath34 is contractible , as a germ of a semialgebraic set .",
    "it follows that the family @xmath35 approximates the singular fibre @xmath0 up to @xmath31 cycles that vanish as @xmath9 goes to @xmath22 .",
    "the number @xmath36 of these cycles appears as an analytic invariant of the germ of the hypersurface @xmath6 that is geometrically embodied on the nearby fibres @xmath37 of the deformation on the singular fibre ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "b. teissier embedded the milnor number @xmath31 in a finite sequence of integers in the following way . for a generic vector space @xmath19 of @xmath38 of dimension @xmath39 ,",
    "the milnor number of the restriction of @xmath6 to @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath19 and is denoted @xmath40 .",
    "in particular @xmath41 and therefore the sequence @xmath42 gives a multidimensional version of @xmath31 .",
    "we can consider other invariants attached to the milnor fibre of @xmath6 , also extending the simple invariant @xmath31 : the lefschetz numbers of the iterates of the monodromy of the milnor fibration , that we introduce now in order to fix notations in the sequel .",
    "the milnor fibre @xmath43 may be endowed with an isomorphism @xmath4 , the monodromy of the milnor fibre , defined up to homotopy and that induces in an unambiguous way an automorphism , also denoted @xmath4 , on the cohomology group @xmath44 @xmath45 for the @xmath7-th iterate @xmath46 of @xmath4 , for any @xmath47 , one finally defines the lefschetz number @xmath48 of @xmath46 by @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the trace of endomorphims .",
    "note that @xmath51 and that the eigenvalues of @xmath4 are roots of unity ( see for instance @xcite ) .    a more convenient deformation of @xmath52 than the family @xmath53 , at least for the practical computation of the topological invariants we just have introduced , is provided by an adapted resolution of the singularity of @xmath6 at @xmath22 .",
    "to define such a resolution and fix the notations used in section [ section mot ] , let us consider @xmath54 a proper birational map which is an isomorphism over the ( germ of the ) complement of @xmath52 in @xmath55 , such that @xmath56 and the jacobian determinant @xmath57 are normal crossings and @xmath58 is a union of components of the divisor @xmath59 .",
    "we denote by @xmath60 , for @xmath61 , the irreducible components of @xmath59 and assume that @xmath62 are the irreducible components of @xmath58 for @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the multiplicity @xmath66 of @xmath56 along @xmath67 and for @xmath68 by @xmath69 the number @xmath70 . for any @xmath71",
    ", we set @xmath72 .",
    "the collection @xmath73 gives a canonical stratification of the divisor @xmath74 , compatible with @xmath75 such that in some affine open subvariety @xmath76 in @xmath4 we have @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a unit , that is to say a rational function which does not vanish on @xmath76 , and @xmath79 are local coordinates .",
    "now the nearby fibres @xmath43 are isomorphic to their lifting @xmath80 in @xmath4 and the family @xmath81 approximates the divisor @xmath82 .",
    "of course the geometry of @xmath83 has apparently nothing to do with the geometry of our starting germ @xmath84 , but as the topological information concerning the singularity of @xmath85 is carried by the nearby fibres family @xmath86 , all this information is still encoded in the family @xmath81 , and the discrete data @xmath87 although depending on the choice of the resolution , may be combined in order to explicitly compute invariants of the singularity .",
    "not only @xmath31 , the most elementary of our invariants , may be computed in the resolution , but also more elaborated ones such that the lefschetz numbers of the iterates of the monodromy of the singularity . indeed , by @xcite we have the celebrated acampo formulas @xmath88 and in particular @xmath89    [ milnorclosure ] denoting @xmath90 the closure of the milnor fibre of @xmath91 , since the boundary @xmath92 is a compact smooth manifold with odd dimension , we have @xmath93 , and in particular @xmath94 .",
    "this is why , in the complex case and for topological considerations at the level of the euler - poincar characteristic , the issue of the open or closed nature of balls is not so relevant .",
    "in contrast , in the real case , this issue really matters .",
    "the second main example of invariants arising from a deformation that we aim to emphasize and develop here , comes from convex geometry . in this case",
    ", starting from a compact convex set of @xmath95 , it is usual to approximate this set by its family of @xmath9-tubular neighbourhoods , @xmath96 , since those neighbourhoods remain convex and generally have a more regular shape than the original set .",
    "this method is notably used in @xcite to generate a finite sequence of metric invariants attached to a compact convex polytope @xmath97 ( the convex hull of a finite number of points ) in @xmath95 ( actually in @xmath98 or @xmath99 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is established in @xcite that the volume of the tubular neighbourhood of radius @xmath100 of @xmath97 , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the closed ball of @xmath95 centred at @xmath103 with radius @xmath104 , is a polynomial in @xmath9 with coefficients @xmath105 depending only on @xmath97 and being invariant under isometries of @xmath95 .",

    "when @xmath111 in this formula , one gets @xmath112 . on the other hand , denoting @xmath113 the diameter of @xmath97 , for any @xmath114 , the inclusions @xmath115 show that @xmath116 and thus @xmath117 . denoting the euler - poincar characteristic by @xmath118 and having in mind further generalizations , the relation @xmath117 has rather to be considered as @xmath119",
    "a direct proof of @xmath108 leads to an expression of the other coefficients @xmath107 in terms of some geometrical data of @xmath97 . to give this proof",

    "we will then explain how all our local invariants are related and how such kind of relation illustrates , in the very general context of definable sets over the reals , the emergence of a well - known principle in convex geometry wherein additive invariants ( with some additional properties ) may not be so numerous ( section 2 ) . finally , we will stress the fact that the additive nature of an invariant coming from a deformation allows us to compute this invariant in some adapted scissors ring via some generating zeta function capturing the nature of the deformation .",
    "this is the point of view underlies the work of denef and loeser ( section 3 ) .    as well as in this introduction , in the sequel , @xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 are respectively the open ball , the closed ball and the sphere centred at @xmath103 and with radius @xmath171 of the real or the complex vector spaces @xmath95 or @xmath38 . if necessary , to avoid confusion , we emphasize the dimension @xmath156 of the ambient space to which the ball belongs by denoting @xmath258 .",

    "this difficult and still unsolved problem naturally appears as soon as one consider the localizations @xmath500 of @xmath151 and their relation with other classical additive invariants such as the @xmath501 s .",
    "indeed , the question of why and how such invariants are related falls within the framework of question [ hadquestion ] .",
    "let s clarify this principled position .",
    "the invariants @xmath528 define spherical @xmath418-invariant and continuous valuations @xmath529 on the convex sets of @xmath513 by the formula @xmath530 where @xmath165 is a convex set of @xmath513 , that is to say the trace in @xmath513 of the cone @xmath531 with vertex the origin of @xmath95 . another possible finite sequence of continuous and @xmath418-invariant spherical valuations on convex polytopes of @xmath513 is @xmath532 where @xmath533 is a spherical polytope , that is to say that @xmath534 is the intersection of a finite number of closed half vector spaces of @xmath95 , @xmath535 the set of all @xmath109-dimensional faces of @xmath97 ( the @xmath536-dimensional faces of @xmath537 ) and @xmath538 the external angle of @xmath537 along @xmath539 .",
    "the valuations @xmath540 are the natural spherical substitutes of the euclidean lipschitz - killing curvatures @xmath151 according to formula @xmath149 .    finally the polar invariants @xmath541 also define continuous and @xmath418-invariants spherical valuations @xmath542 on the convex sets of @xmath513 , according to a formula of the same type that formula @xmath543 @xmath544 these three families of continuous and @xmath418-invariant spherical valuations @xmath545 being linearly independent families in the space of spherical valuations , a positive answer to question [ hadquestion ] would have for direct consequence that each element of one family is a linear combination of elements of any of the other two families .    therefore , in restriction to polyhedral cones , each element of the family @xmath546 could be expressed as a linear combination ( with universal coefficients ) of elements of the family @xmath541 and conversely . despite the absence of any positive answer to question [ hadquestion ] for @xmath547 , this linear dependence is proved in @xcite ( theorem a4 and a5 ) over the set of convex polytopes ( and in @xcite , section 3.1 , even over the set of definable cones ) .",
    "it is actually shown that each invariant @xmath500 and each invariant @xmath501 may be expressed as a linear combination ( with universal coefficients ) of elements of the family @xmath548 .",
    "the coefficients involved in such linear combinations may be explicitly computed by considering the case of polytopes .    in conclusion ,",
    "an anticipating positive answer to this question would imply the existence of a finite number of independent models for additive , continuous and @xmath418-invariant functions on convex and conic germs .",
    "consequently , solely following this principle and restricted at least to convex cones , our local invariants @xmath501 and @xmath500 would be automatically linearly dependent . in the next step , in order to extend a relation formula involving some valuations from the set of finite union of convex conic polytopes to the set of general conic definable set one has to prove some general statement according to which the normal cycle of a definable conic set may be approximate by the normal cycles of a family of finite union of convex conic polytopes .",
    "we do not want to go more into technical details and even define the notion of normal cycle introduced by fu ; we just point out that this issue has been tackled recently in @xcite . finally to extend a relation formula from the set of conic definable set to the set of all definable germs one just has to use the local conic structure of definable germs and the deformation on the tangent cone ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    to finish to shed light on convex geometry as an area from which some strong relations between singularity invariants may be understood , let us remark that the following generalization of hadwiger s theorem [ had ] has been obtained by alesker .",
    "let @xmath244 be a compact subgroup of @xmath418 .    1 .",
    "the vector space @xmath549 of continuous , translation and @xmath244-invariant valuations on @xmath511 has finite dimension if and only if @xmath244 acts transitively on @xmath513 ( see @xcite theorem 8.1 , @xcite proposition 2.6 ) .",

    "the possibility of generating invariants from a deformation of a singular set into a family of approximating and less complicated sets is perfectly illustrated by the work developed by denef and loeser consisting in stating that some generating series attached to a singular germ are rational .",
    "such generating series have their coefficients in some convenient ring reflecting the special properties of the invariants to highlight , such as additivity , multiplicativity , analytic invariance , the relation with some specific group action and so forth , and on the other hand each of these coefficients is attached to a single element of the deformation family .",
    "it follows that such a generating series captures the geometrical aspect that one aims to focus on through the deformation family as well as its rationality indicates that asymptotically this geometry specializes on the geometry of the special fibre approximated by the deformation family .",
    "indeed , being rational strongly expresses that a series is encoded by a finite amount of data concentrated in its higher coefficients . to be more explicit we",

    "the rationality of some generating poincar series is proved .",
    "these series , called zeta functions , have for coefficients the number of points in @xmath551 of @xmath552 , for @xmath6 a @xmath120-ary polynomial with coefficients in the valuation ring @xmath553 of some discrete valuation field of characteristic zero , with maximal ideal @xmath554 and finite residue field of cardinal @xmath555 .",
    "this result amounts to prove the rationality ( as a function of @xmath556 , @xmath557 , @xmath558 ) of an integral of type @xmath559 ( the igusa local zeta function ) which is achieve using a convenient resolution of singularities of @xmath6 , as described in the introduction ( see also @xcite for comparable statements on serre s series and a strategy based on macintyre s proof of elimination of quantifiers as an alternative to hironaka s resolution of singularities ) . in the opposite direction , the rational function ,",

    "another key milestone in the systematic use of discrete valuation fields ( here with finite residue field and more explicitely in the @xmath560-adic context ) have been reached in batyrev s paper @xcite , where it is shown that two birationally equivalent calabi - yau manifolds over @xmath459 have the same betti numbers .",
    "indeed , by weil s conjectures , these betti numbers are obtained from the rational expression of the local zeta functions having for coefficients the number of points in the reductions modulo @xmath561 of the manifolds into consideration ( viewed as defined over @xmath562 when they are defined over @xmath563 ) and on the other hand , these local zeta functions may be computed by igusa s integrals over these manifolds .",
    "being birationally equivalent , these manifolds provide the same integrals .",

    "note that the theory may be developed in great generality and not only in equicharacteristic zero ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of kontsevich was to define an integration theory over arc spaces , say @xmath564 $ ] , by considering a measure with values in the grothendieck ring @xmath565 of algebraic varieties over @xmath459 ( localized by the multiplicative set generated by the class @xmath566 of @xmath567 in @xmath565 ) .",

    "<S> in this survey on local additive invariants of real and complex definable singular germs we systematically present classical or more recent invariants of different nature as emerging from a tame degeneracy principle . for this goal , we associate to a given singular germ a specific deformation family whose geometry degenerates in such a way that it eventually gives rise to a list of invariants attached to this germ . </S>",
    "<S> complex analytic invariants , real curvature invariants and motivic type invariants are encompassed under this point of view . </S>",
    "<S> we then explain how all these invariants are related to each other as well as we propose a general conjectural principle explaining why such invariants have to be related . </S>",
    "<S> this last principle may appear as the incarnation in definable geometry of deep finiteness results of convex geometry , according to which additive invariants in convex geometry are very few . </S>"
