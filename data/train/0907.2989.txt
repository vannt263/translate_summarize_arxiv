    "since the advent of string theory , theories of spacetime with extra dimensions become prevalent in physics .",
    "the idea of extra dimensional spacetime can be dated back to the work of kaluza and klein @xcite , who tried to propose a theory that can unify classical electrodynamics and gravity .",
    "recently , intensive investigations on the casimir effect in spacetime with extra dimensions are undergoing . in the context of string theory , casimir effect was studied in @xcite .",
    "the possible roles played by casimir energy as dark energy or cosmological constant was discussed in @xcite . the use of casimir effect in stabilizing extra dimensions were considered in @xcite . in the braneworld scenario ,",
    "casimir effect was also considered in @xcite .",
    "the influence of the extra dimensions on the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates in macroscopic ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime was studied in @xcite . in the pioneering work of casimir @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel perfectly conducting plates in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime is attractive .",
    "it was confirmed later in the work of mehra @xcite and brown and maclay @xcite that the thermal correction would not change the sign of the casimir force .",
    "the recent works @xcite explored the possible influence of the extra dimensions to the magnitude and sign of the casimir force . in @xcite ,",
    "the casimir effect on a pair of parallel plates in spacetime with one extra dimension compactified to a circle was considered .",
    "generalizations to extra dimensional space with more dimensions and more complicated geometries were considered in @xcite .",
    "further generalizations to finite temperature casimir effect were studied in @xcite . in the works",
    "@xcite , the spacetimes considered are the generalized kaluza - klein ( kk ) models of the form @xmath0 with metric @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the usual ( 3 + 1)-@xmath3 metric on the minkowski spacetime @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a riemannian metric on the @xmath6-dimensional compact internal space @xmath7 . in this model",
    ", the metric is factorizable . hence the geometrical structures of the macroscopic manifold @xmath4 and the internal manifold @xmath7 are independent .",
    "it has been concluded that the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates due to a scalar field with homogeneous boundary conditions where dirichlet conditions are imposed on both plates ( @xmath8 conditions ) or neumann conditions are imposed on both plates ( @xmath9 conditions ) is always attractive , at either zero or any finite temperature . on the other hand , for mixed boundary conditions where one of the plates assumes",
    "dirichlet boundary condition and the other one assumes neumann boundary condition ( @xmath10 conditions ) , the casimir force is always repulsive .    in @xcite ,",
    "the spacetime considered is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) brane model .",
    "this model was proposed in @xcite to solve the hierarchy problem between the planck and the electroweak scale . in this model ,",
    "the underlying spacetime is a five - dimensional anti - de sitter space ( ads@xmath11 ) with background metric @xmath12this metric is non - factorizable .",
    "the extra dimension with coordinate @xmath13 is compactified on the orbifold @xmath14 .",
    "the metric of the underlying minkowski spacetime depends on the extra dimension through the warp factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 determines the degree of curvature of the ads@xmath11 space .",
    "there are two types of rs brane models , denoted by rsi and rsii respectively . in rsi , there are two 3-branes with equal and opposite tensions , one invisible and one visible , localized at @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , where @xmath19 is the compactification radius of the extra dimension .",
    "the @xmath20-symmetry is realized by @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the standard model fields are localized on the visible brane .",
    "rsii can be considered as a limiting case of rsi where @xmath23 , i.e. , one brane is located at infinity . in relation to casimir effect on parallel plates",
    ", rs model was generalized to @xmath24-branes with @xmath6-compact dimensions compactified to an @xmath6-torus embedded in a @xmath25-dimensional spacetime with background metric @xmath26 in @xcite and @xcite , it was concluded that the zero temperature casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates in either the ( 4 + 1)-d rs model or its extension due to a massless scalar field with @xmath8 boundary conditions is always attractive .",
    "the methods used in @xcite and @xcite involve approximations to the tower of masses induced by the extra dimension @xmath14 , and the attractive nature of the casimir force is not obvious from its analytical expressions .",
    "it is also not clear whether the approximations used in deriving the casimir force would affect the conclusion about the sign of the casimir force .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to obtain an exact expression for the casimir force .    as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "the rs scenario is the simplest case of warped geometries .",
    "the higher dimensional warped geometries deserve more attention especially in connection with string theory , which asserts that our spacetime should has eleven dimension . in this article",
    ", we consider generalized rs model as in @xcite whose background metric is @xmath27compared to the model , the internal space now is an arbitrary @xmath6-dimensional compact manifold with riemannian metric @xmath5 .",
    "it can be considered as a kk model embedded in a rs model .",
    "therefore we call this model randall - sundrum - kaluza - klein ( rskk ) model .",
    "our concern here is the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates rather than the casimir force acting on the branes which was considered in @xcite . as in most of the works about casimir effect on parallel plates in higher dimensional spacetime",
    ", we regard the parallel plates as co - dimension one hyperplanes in the spacetime , and the field is assumed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "we derive the exact formulas for the finite temperature casimir force and show that warped extra dimensions can not change the attractive or repulsive nature of the casimir force .",
    "more precisely , it will be concluded that for @xmath8 or @xmath9 boundary conditions , the casimir force is always attractive ; whereas for @xmath10 boundary conditions , the casimir force is always repulsive .",
    "the units used are such that @xmath28 .",
    "in this section , we derive the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates in the rskk model with background metric due to a scalar field @xmath29 of mass @xmath30 with equation of motion @xmath31 using separation of variables , @xmath32the equation of motion for @xmath33 is equivalent to the following two equations : @xmath34 eq . is the equation of motion for a scalar field with effective mass @xmath35 in the kk spacetime . for the first equation in , the general solutions can be expressed in terms of the bessel functions of the first and second kinds @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38where @xmath39 in the massless case , there is an additional solution given by @xmath40constant and @xmath41 .",
    "we first consider the rskki model , where two @xmath24-branes are localized at @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . in this case ,",
    "boundary conditions imposed on the branes at @xmath17 and @xmath42 give rise to discrete spectrums of @xmath43 .",
    "there are various possibilities @xcite of boundary conditions .",
    "we choose the one considered in @xcite , where neumann boundary conditions are imposed on the branes , i.e. , @xmath44 . in the massless case ,",
    "the constant functions satisfy this boundary conditions .",
    "the general solution satisfies the boundary conditions at @xmath17 and @xmath18 if and only if @xmath45this gives a nontrivial solution to @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 for simplicity , we only consider the massless case , i.e. , the @xmath48 case from now on . in this case , @xmath49 and becomes @xmath50multiplying eq . with @xmath51 and integrating over @xmath13 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , we find that the effective masses @xmath35 should satisfy @xmath52 .",
    "therefore we only consider the real solutions of .",
    "one can verify that if @xmath35 is a solution of , so is @xmath53 .",
    "however , @xmath35 and @xmath53 give rise to linearly dependent solutions of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore we only need to consider the positive solutions of .",
    "let @xmath54 be the effective mass corresponding to the solution @xmath55 = constant and let @xmath56 be all the positive solutions of .",
    "denote by @xmath57 a nontrivial solution to with @xmath58 which satisfies the neumann boundary conditions at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    to find the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates",
    ", we use the piston approach @xcite ( see fig . [ f1 ] ) .",
    "= .45    the casimir force acting on the piston located at @xmath59 is given by @xmath60where @xmath61 is the casimir energy in a cavity of the form @xmath62\\times[0,l_2]\\times[0 , l_3]\\times n^n \\times s^1/\\mathbb{z}_2 $ ] defined by @xmath63the summation runs through all @xmath64 which are the eigenfrequencies of the field @xmath29 satisfying the equation of motion , with appropriate boundary conditions on the boundary of the cavity . by letting @xmath65 , we obtain the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates embedded orthogonally inside an infinitely long rectangular cylinder @xcite : @xmath66    in this article , we impose dirichlet boundary conditions on the walls @xmath67 of the rectangular cylinder which are transversal to the @xmath68 direction . on the @xmath68 direction , we consider different combinations of boundary conditions .",
    "a complete set of independent solutions to the equation with @xmath58 is given by @xmath69where for @xmath70 , @xmath71respectively for @xmath72 and @xmath10 boundary conditions .",
    "for @xmath73 , @xmath74 is an eigenfunction of the laplace operator @xmath75 on @xmath7 with eigenvalue @xmath76 . by convention",
    ", @xmath77 corresponds to the constant functions on @xmath7 .",
    "the eigenfrequency of @xmath78 is @xmath79where @xmath80 for @xmath72 and @xmath10 boundary conditions respectively .",
    "the finite temperature casimir force can be calculated in the same way as in @xcite , which gives @xmath81the sum of the terms with @xmath82 is the finite temperature casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates in the kk model due to a massless scalar field @xcite . notice that each summand in the summation of is positive .",
    "therefore , the sign of the casimir force is governed by the factor @xmath83 in front of the summation , which is negative for @xmath84 and positive for @xmath85 . as a result",
    ", we find that the casimir force is always attractive at any temperature for @xmath8 and @xmath9 boundary conditions , but always repulsive for @xmath10 boundary conditions .",
    "this shows that the warped extra dimension can not change the sign of the casimir force , but it increases the strength of the casimir force .    for the influence of the internal extra dimension , notice that the sum of the terms with @xmath86 in corresponds to the casimir force in the absence of the internal space @xmath7 .",
    "using again the fact that each summand of the summation in is positive , one finds that the extra dimensions enhance the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "moreover , the casimir force becomes stronger in the presence of more extra dimensions .",
    "when the size of the internal manifold shrinks to zero , only the terms with @xmath86 in give a nonzero limit : @xmath87which is the finite temperature casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates in the rsi model .    as was proved in @xcite , when @xmath88 , the leading term of the casimir force is of order @xmath89 .",
    "divide by @xmath89 and take the limit where @xmath90 , one finds that the casimir force density acting on a pair of infinite parallel plates in rskki model is @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the sum of the @xmath93 term is understood as @xmath94    taking the zero temperature limit of , we find that the zero temperature casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates in the rskki model is @xmath95 in the limit where @xmath89 is large , we obtain the zero temperature casimir force density acting on a pair of infinite parallel plates : @xmath96the sum of the terms in with @xmath97 should be understood as @xmath98 which is the the zero temperature casimir force density @xmath99 acting on a pair of infinite parallel plates in the @xmath100-dimensional minskowski spacetime due to a massless scalar field . in the limit of vanishing internal space @xmath7 , we obtain the zero temperature casimir force density acting on a pair of infinite parallel plates in the rsi model : @xmath101 by using the approximation @xmath102 in as in @xcite , we find that in the case of @xmath8 boundary conditions , i.e. , @xmath103 , we obtain the same result as derived in @xcite ( formula ( 2.18 ) ) . in the general case where there are @xmath6 extra dimensions compactified to a torus @xmath104 on the branes , with radius @xmath105 respectively",
    ", the authors in @xcite used the approximation @xmath106which is only good if the internal manifold has dimension @xmath107 . using this approximation in with @xmath103",
    ", it seems that there are still some discrepancies between the result of @xcite ( see formula ( 32 ) in @xcite ) and our result in the terms corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "however , if one applies the chowla - selberg formula for epstein zeta functions to the three terms on the first two lines of ( 32 ) in @xcite , one would recover the sum of the terms with @xmath82 .",
    "compared to the works of @xcite , our results and do not use any approximations to the effective masses .",
    "they are exact results .",
    "moreover , our formulas and show manifestly that the casimir force is attractive for dirichlet - dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "since rskkii model is a limit of the rskki model when the compactifying radius @xmath108 of the extra dimension with coordinate @xmath13 becomes infinite , one would expect that the same conclusions about the sign of the casimir force still hold for the rskkii model . from",
    ", one can show that as @xmath109 , @xmath110 is approximately equal to @xmath111 for some @xmath112 .",
    "this implies that @xmath113 can be considered as the eigenvalues coming from an extra dimension compactified to a ( twisted ) torus of radius @xmath114 .",
    "therefore shows that for @xmath108 large enough , the magnitude of the casimir force is increased if we increase the compactifying radius @xmath108 . in the special cases considered in @xcite ,",
    "this behavior was confirmed by the figures in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the same argument as in @xcite shows that the casimir force will be proportional to the radius @xmath115 of the extra dimension .",
    "therefore when all the parameters except @xmath108 are kept fixed and @xmath116 , the casimir force is proportional to @xmath117 , and if @xmath108 goes to infinity in such a way that @xmath118 is kept fixed , then the casimir force is proportional to @xmath108 . as a result",
    ", we can not take the limit @xmath116 on the casimir force directly . in @xcite ,",
    "finite results have been claimed for the casimir force density for the rsii model . in these articles ,",
    "the authors retained the @xmath82 terms in or , and change the summation over @xmath119 to an integral over @xmath30 .",
    "the latter is tantamount to dividing by the factor @xmath117 and taking the limit @xmath116 on the summation of @xmath119 terms .",
    "this combination of retaining the @xmath82 term and changing the summation to integral is not equivalent to the direct @xmath116 limit .",
    "as we have discussed , one should expect that in the limit @xmath116 , the casimir force density acting on infinite parallel plates increases beyond all bounds .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to see that the procedure used in @xcite gives casimir force that is attractive for homogeneous boundary conditions and repulsive for mixed boundary conditions .",
    "as is discussed earlier , the presence of the extra dimensions enhances the casimir force",
    ". it will be interesting to study whether the extra dimensions give a significant increase to the casimir force .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the case with @xmath8 boundary conditions .",
    "we discuss first the case of the rsi model where there is no internal space . at any temperature , numerical computations of and show that for plate separation @xmath120 in the range @xmath121 nm @xmath122 @xmath123 nm , the correction to the casimir force in @xmath100-d spacetime is less than @xmath124 for @xmath1253ev . for @xmath126 nm ,",
    "the correction to the casimir force becomes @xmath127 when @xmath128 1.40ev ; and for @xmath129 nm , the correction to the casimir force becomes @xmath127 when @xmath128 0.13ev .",
    "as is well known , the resolution of the hierarchy problem requires @xmath130 . in this case , the correction to the casimir force is significant if @xmath131 gev . if @xmath16 is of planck scale @xmath132gev , then @xmath133400gev @xmath134 3ev , and the correction to the casimir force would be too small to be observed in the current casimir experiments .",
    "this situation can be changed if there exists an internal space that has size comparable to the plate separation .",
    "assume that the internal space is @xmath135 with radius @xmath136 . in the absence of the extra dimension @xmath14 or when @xmath137 3ev",
    ", the correction to the casimir force is less than @xmath124 if @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath139 , then the correction will grow to @xmath127 . when @xmath140 , the correction is @xmath141 .",
    "however , it is believed that the internal manifold should be compactified to a size much smaller than @xmath142 nm , therefore the existence of internal space would not be able to be detected by the present casimir experiments which measures casimir force for separations larger than @xmath142 nm .",

    "the contributions of this article are the followings .",
    "we have derived exact formulas for the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates due to a massless scalar field without using any approximations . from the exact formulas",
    ", we showed that the casimir force is always attractive for dirichlet - dirichlet or neumann - neumann boundary conditions , and repulsive for dirichlet - neumann conditions .",
    "although the discussions in this article are restricted to the extension of randall - sundrum model , which we call randall - sundrum - kaluza - klein model , and specific boundary conditions have been imposed on the branes , the discussions in this article can be applied in a more general context . notice that the change in the boundary conditions on the branes only alters the spectrum of the effective masses , and the change in the geometry of the extra dimensions only alter the spectrum of the internal manifold . therefore the results of this article can be applied to more general spacetime model with extra dimensions .",
    "one can deduce as in this article that in the absence of tachyonic modes , the sign of the casimir force due to a scalar field acting on a pair of parallel plates in the macroscopic @xmath100-dimensional minskowski spacetime only depends on the boundary conditions imposed on the plates , and is not changed by the presence of extra dimensions .",
