    "it is a sequence of homotopy equivalences . on the other hand , @xmath125",
    "the argument for @xmath74 is similar .",

    "the restriction of @xmath133 to @xmath134 is clearly a homotopy equivalence and , for the same reason as before , the inclusion @xmath135 is a cofibration .",
    "collapsing the fibers of @xmath133 consecutively we get a chain of homotopy equivalences so @xmath133 ( and , hence , @xmath113 ) is itself a homotopy equivalence .    as an immediate corollary",
    "we get that for @xmath44 spaces @xmath37 are connected and for @xmath51 - simply - connected .",
    "indeed , @xmath56 is obtained by removing a triangulable subset of codimension @xmath110 from @xmath136 .",

    "points of @xmath139 are pairs of disjoint mod 2 divisors on a real line . we can treat them as sets of particles of different `` charges '' , such that particles of the same charge annihilate each other and particles of different charges can not collide .",
    "let us extend the analogy .    at the time",
    "@xmath140 let all the particles be at rest .",
    "we introduce three forces : gravity with the potential @xmath141 , friction which is proportional to the velocity of the particle , and interaction between particles .",
    "a particle interacts only with its immediate neighbors ; it attracts particles of the same charge and repels particles of the opposite charge ; the magnitude of this force is @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the distance between particles .",
    "the dynamics of this system defines a flow on @xmath139 . as particles of the same charge",
    "annihilate each other , the interaction forces change discontinuously , but , as the force is essentially the second derivative of the coordinate , the flow is continuous , at least on any compact subset .",
    "calculation shows that there is exactly one state of equilibrium for each connected component of @xmath139 , so as @xmath144 we get a homotopy of any map @xmath145 to a constant map .",
    "hence , all components of @xmath139 have trivial homotopy groups and this implies that they are contractible .",
    "[ prop : limit ] for all @xmath110 the natural inclusion @xmath147 is a homotopy equivalence .    the statement of the proposition for @xmath39 follows from theorem  [ thm : r1 ] ,",

    "denote by @xmath150 the subspace of loops which have an infinite number of intersection points with some of the hyperplanes @xmath151 .",
    "the inclusion map @xmath152 is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath3 can be thought of as an infinite - dimensional manifold and @xmath150 is a subset of infinite codimension , so removing @xmath150 does nt change the homotopy type of @xmath3 .",

    "every loop on @xmath2 can be lifted to a loop or a path on @xmath153 @xmath154 first with the help of some self - homeomorphism of @xmath155 we deform the space @xmath156 into the space of loops ( paths ) on @xmath155 that have not more than a finite number of intersections with any of the sets @xmath157 for some small @xmath33 .",
    "notice that any piecewise geodesic ( in the standard metric ) path on @xmath158 has only a finite number of intersections with @xmath157 for any @xmath17 .",
    "now one can use piecewise geodesic approximations and the methods of @xcite can be applied .",

    "this is enough to claim that every element of @xmath177 is an image of some element of @xmath178 .",

    "then we have a continuous map @xmath285 the degree of the ornament is just the degree of this map .    even though the above construction can not be found in @xcite , historically it precedes not only ornaments , but , in fact , the very notion of degree .",
    "it can be found , in a more general setting , in kronecker s paper @xcite , where he defines the `` characteristic '' of a system of functions with no common zeros .",
    "kronecker s definition of the characteristic of the system @xmath286 was roughly as follows .",
    "suppose that the zero sets of functions @xmath173 intersect transversally .",
    "to each point of intersection @xmath287 of the curves @xmath288 and @xmath289 we assign an integer which is equal to 0 if @xmath290 , and @xmath291 if @xmath292 and the tangent vectors to the curves @xmath288 and @xmath289 at @xmath287 define a positive / negative orientation of @xmath279 .",
    "( we assume that the orientations of the curves @xmath293 are induced by the standard orientation of @xmath279 . )",
    "the characteristic of the system of functions @xmath286 is the sum of these integers over all @xmath287 .",
    "it is clear that this definition amounts to calculating the algebraic number of inverse images of a point in @xmath294 , so the kronecker characteristic of a system @xmath286 is the same thing as the degree of a map given by these functions .",
    "modern references for the kronecker characteristic are @xcite and , less recent , but probably more precise , @xcite .",
