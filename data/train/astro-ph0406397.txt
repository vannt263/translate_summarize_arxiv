    "the @xmath8-relation of cepheids is of fundamental importance in establishing the cosmic distance scale . determining whether or not the slope of the galactic relation is different from that for the lmc and/or smc cepheids relations is of prime importance , as this could imply a metallicity dependence of the slope of the relation , with important consequences for the application of the @xmath8-relation to other galaxies .",
    "the apparent zero point and slope of the fundamental ( fu ) and first - overtone ( fo ) @xmath8-relations in the lmc and smc have now been well determined in @xmath9 ( the reddening free , so - called wesenheit - index based on @xmath2 and @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 and @xmath6 ( udalski et al . 1999 , groenewegen 2000 , nikolaev et al .",
    "2004 , sandage et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the situation is less clear for our galaxy .",
    "the accuracy of the hipparcos  parallax data was not high enough to determine slope _ and _ zero point . instead , the data had to be analysed in a statistical way , such that for an _ assumed _ slope , a zero point could be derived ( e.g. , feast & catchpole 1997 ; groenewegen & oudmaijer 2000 )    there are basically two alternatives to obtain direct distance estimates to galactic cepheids , namely , using cepheids in open clusters ( e.g. feast 1999 , tammann et al .",
    "2003 ) where the distance to the cluster has been obtained in another way ( basically main - sequence fitting ) , or , in combining linear diameter determinations ( as determined from integration of the radial velocity curve and assuming a projection factor ) , with angular diameter determinations coming from direct measurements using an interferometer ( e.g. kervella et al . 2003 ) or coming from a surface - brightness ( sb ) relation and a reddening - corrected magnitude ( e.g. fouqu et al .",
    "2003 , storm et al .",
    "2004 ) .    for the latter method to work one has therefore to determine and calibrate accurate sb relations .",
    "there is a whole body of work on this subject ( e.g. , barnes et al .",
    "1978 ; di benedetto 1993 [ db93 ] ) , and more recently , with direct application to cepheids , the works by fouqu & gieren ( 1997 ; herafter fg97 ) , and nordgren et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter nord02 ) .",
    "the latter calibration is used by fouqu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to establish the most recent slopes and zero points of the galactic @xmath8-relation for fu cepheids in @xmath12 colours .",
    "in addition , sb - relations are important in estimating angular diameters for planning interferometric observations ( either to check if a potential science target would be resolved , or to check if a calibrator is indeed unresolved , for a given baseline ) , and for distance estimates in eclipsing binaries ( salaris & groenewegen 2002 ) .    the calibration by nord02 is based on 57 giants observed with the navy prototype optical interferometer ( npoi ) by this group ( nordgren et al . 1999 ; nordgren et al . 2001 ) . on the other hand there have been other recent papers presenting new diameter determinations ( e.g. , 69 stars in van belle et al . 1999 ) , and there exist older data of high quality ; recently , richichi & percheron ( 2002 ) conveniently presented a catalog of high angular resolution measurements .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present updated sb relations based on the largest set of accurate angular diameter determinations .",
    "section  2 presents the angular diameter data and the search for apparent magnitudes",
    ". section  3 briefly recalls the relevant equations , and section  4 presents the results .",
    "the discussion in section  5 ends this paper .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "i thank ren oudmaijer and pascal fouqu for reading a preliminary version of this paper , and maurizio salaris for discussion ."
