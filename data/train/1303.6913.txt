    "in this paper we present a method to evaluate important constants which describe the behaviour of physical fields near crack tips in a perturbed problem set in a domain containing an imperfect interface .",
    "imperfect interfaces account for the fact that the interface between two materials is almost never sharp .",
    "@xcite accounted for this observation by by placing a very thin strip of a homogeneous material in the model between two larger bodies with different elastic moduli to that of the strip .",
    "if the thin layer is considered to be either much softer or stiffer than the main bodies , its presence can be replaced in models by transmission conditions , whose derivation can be found for example in @xcite for a soft imperfect interface , or @xcite for a stiff imperfect interface .",
    "we shall consider only soft imperfect interfaces in the present paper .",
    "@xcite presented an asymptotic model of adhesive joints in a layered structure .",
    "@xcite found the asymptotic behaviour of displacements and stresses in a vicinity of the crack tip situated on a soft imperfect interface between two different elastic materials , where the non - ideal interface is replaced by non - ideal transmission conditions .",
    "for such a case , the asymptotics are of a markedly different form to the perfect interface case , in which components of stress exhibit a square root singularity at the crack tip ; such behaviour is not present for imperfect interface cracks",
    ".    a key element of our approach will be the derivation of a new weight function .",
    "the concept of weight functions was introduced by @xcite . in the perfect interface setting these provide weights for the loads applied to the crack surfaces such that their weighted integrals over the crack surfaces provide the stress intensity factors at a certain point .",
    "@xcite modified the weight function technique to yield similarly useful asymptotic constants that characterise stress fields near crack tips along an imperfect interface .",
    "a survey of macro - microcrack interaction problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance is the recent manuscript of @xcite which examines an analogous problem to that presently considered with a perfect interface in place of the imperfect interface .",
    "the approach in that paper utilises the dipole matrix approach of @xcite to construct an asymptotic solution that takes into account the presence of a micro - defect such as a small inclusion .",
    "the present paper seeks to adapt this approach to the imperfect interface setting .",
    "we adopt the following structure for the paper .",
    "we first formulate the physical problem before giving the weight function problem formulation .",
    "fourier transform techniques allow us to obtain a wiener - hopf type problem for the weight function , whose kernel we factorise in a computationally convenient fashion .",
    "the wiener - hopf equation is solved to yield expressions for the weight function and comparisons are drawn between the perfect and imperfect interface weight function problems .",
    "we then use the reciprocal theorem ( betti formula ) in the spirit of @xcite to relate the sought physical solution to the weight function .",
    "the presence of imperfect interface transmission conditions alters properties of the functions in the betti identity and so different analysis is required .",
    "the application of betti s identity enables us to find an expression for the leading order of tractions @xmath0 near the crack tip in terms of the new weight function and the imposed arbitrary tractions prescribed on the faces of the crack : @xmath1 here , bars denote fourier transform , @xmath2 is a constant depending on the material parameters and extent of interface imperfection , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the jump and average of the weight function across the crack / interface line , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the jump and average of the tractions prescribed on the crack faces .",
    "in section [ section : pert ] , we perform perturbation analysis to determine the impact on the tractions near the crack tip of the presence of a small inclusion .",
    "the asymptotic solution is sought in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the unperturbed physical displacement solution ( the solution with no inclusion present ) , @xmath9 is a boundary layer concentrated near the inclusion and @xmath10 is introduced to fulfil the original boundary conditions on the crack faces and along the imperfect interface .",
    "this enables us to find the first order variation in the crack tip tractions ; we expand the constant @xmath11 as @xmath12 and use betti identity arguments to derive an expression for @xmath13 ( see ( [ deltaa0expression ] ) ) .",
    "this is interpreted physically as the change in traction near the crack tip induced by the inclusion s presence ; as such we say that the sign of @xmath13 for any given positioning and configuration of the inclusion either shields or amplifies the propagation of the main crack .",
    "note that for the unpeturbed setup ( with no inclusion present ) @xmath14 and so we will naturally drop the superscript when referring to the quantity corresponding to the unperturbed problem .",
    "we conclude the paper by presenting numerical results in section [ section : numerical ] .",
    "in particular we show how @xmath0 varies depending on the extent of interface imperfection and choice of material contrast parameter for different loadings .",
    "these computations are performed for point loadings that are chosen to be illustrative of the suitability of our method to asymmetric self - balanced loadings .",
    "we further propose a method of comparing @xmath0 with stress intensity factors from the analogous perfect interface problem and find agreement as the extent of interface imperfection tends towards zero .",
    "we also present computations that show the sign of @xmath13 for varying location and orientation of the micro - defect .",
    "we consider an infinite two - phase plane with an imperfect interface positioned along the positive @xmath15-axis .",
    "a semi - infinite crack is placed occupying the line @xmath16 .",
    "we refer to the half - planes above and below the crack and interface respectively as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the material occupying @xmath19 has shear modulus @xmath20 and mass density @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "the anti - plane shear displacement function @xmath23 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath24     occupying half - planes @xmath19 above and below the crack and imperfect interface for @xmath25 the central point @xmath26 of a micro - defect is situated at a distance @xmath27 from the tip of the main crack . ]",
    "the plane also contains a micro - defect whose centre is at the point @xmath28 ; we will consider in particular elliptic inclusions although other types of defect may be incorporated into the model provided a suitable dipole matrix can be obtained ( see for example @xcite in which micro - cracks and rigid line inclusions are considered ) .",
    "the defect @xmath29 has shear modulus @xmath30 , is placed at a distance @xmath27 from the crack tip , makes an angle @xmath31 with the imperfect interface and is oriented at an angle @xmath32 to the horizontal as shown in figure [ plane : figure : physicaldefectsetup ] . the value of @xmath30 may be greater than or less than the value of @xmath33 ( which may be @xmath34 or @xmath35 depending where the defect is placed ) , and so both stiff and soft defects can be considered .    we assume continuity of tractions across the crack and interface , and introduce imperfect interface conditions ahead of the crack : @xmath36 @xmath37 where the notation @xmath38 defines the jump in displacement across @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 the parameter @xmath41 describes the extent of imperfection of the interface , with larger @xmath42 corresponding to more imperfect interfaces .",
    "we further impose prescribed tractions @xmath43 on the crack faces : @xmath44 these tractions are assumed to be self - balanced ; that is @xmath45 and it is further assumed that @xmath46 vanish in a neighbourhood of the crack tip . although the techniques we will establish can be applied to any permissible loading , we will particularly focus our attention on the case where these loadings are point loadings , with a loading on the upper crack face positioned at @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 ) balanced by two equal point loadings on the lower crack face positioned at @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51",
    ". this loading makes computations more difficult to perform than for the smooth loadings considered by @xcite , but is more illustrative of the asymmetry of the load . near the crack tip",
    ", the physical displacement behaves as @xmath52 as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "it follows that the displacement jump is approximated by @xmath53 as the crack tip is approached along the @xmath15-axis .    in the neighbourhood of the crack tip",
    ", the out of plane component of stress behaves as @xmath54 as @xmath55 , in the usual polar coordinate system and so along the interface , @xmath56 these estimates demonstrate that fourier transforms of the displacement jump and out - of - plane stress components can be taken ; we denote the fourier transformation @xmath57 of a function @xmath58 by @xmath59 thus as @xmath60 , the fourier transform of the displacement jump behaves as @xmath61 moreover , along the axis , the out of plane stress component decays as @xmath62      ) and weight function ( figure @xmath63 ) setups . ]",
    "the sought weight function @xmath64 also satisfies the laplace equation , but with the crack occupying @xmath65 .",
    "we define the functions @xmath66 in their respective half - planes by @xmath67 boundary conditions analogous to the physical set - up apply .",
    "that is , @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 we expect that along the interface , the displacement jump behaves as @xmath71 while along the crack , @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath74 are constants .",
    "we further expect that @xmath75      the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath76 allows us to apply fourier transforms .",
    "moreover , the behaviour near @xmath77 demonstrates that the fourier transform exists as a cauchy principal value integral . applying the fourier",
    "transform with respect to @xmath15 @xmath78 and taking into account the behaviour of @xmath64 at infinity , we obtain that the transformed solutions of ( [ plane : laplace ] ) are of the form @xmath79 with the corresponding expressions for tractions at @xmath80 given by @xmath81 we define the functions @xmath82 by @xmath83 these functions @xmath82 are analytic in the complex half planes denoted by their superscripts .",
    "we expect that as @xmath60 in their respective domains , asymptotic estimates for @xmath82 are @xmath84 and near zero , @xmath85 we verify this later ( see equations ( [ plane : accuratephibehaviour1])-([plane : phiplusinfinity ] ) ) .",
    "the condition of continuity of tractions across the crack and interface ( [ plane : contoftractions ] ) gives that @xmath86 and the fourier transform of the jump function @xmath87 can be seen from ( [ plane : formofubar ] ) to be @xmath88 combining these conditions ( [ plane : whderivation1])-([plane : whderivation3 ] ) , we conclude that the functions @xmath82 satisfy the functional equation of the wiener - hopf type @xmath89 where @xmath90 with the constant @xmath2 given by @xmath91 this wiener - hopf kernel @xmath92 is the same as that found by @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the functions @xmath82 is however different .",
    "in this section we factorise the function @xmath92 as defined in ( [ plane : xidefined ] ) .",
    "as we just remarked , despite this function having been previously factorised in @xcite , we provide here an alternative factorisation which is more convenient for computations .",
    "we define an auxiliary function @xmath93 by @xmath94 with the functions @xmath95 given by @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the standard square root function with its branch cut positioned along the negative real axis .",
    "thus @xmath95 are analytic functions in half - planes corresponding to their respective subscripts .",
    "now , @xmath98 is an even function and behaves at zero and infinity as follows : @xmath99 @xmath100 the kernel function @xmath92 can be factorised as @xmath101 this function can itself be factorised as @xmath102 the functions @xmath103 satisfy @xmath104 , with @xmath105 being regular and non - zero in the half plane @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , stirling s formula gives that the behaviour as @xmath60 in an upper half plane is @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "analogous asymptotics for @xmath109 are easily obtained by noting that @xmath104 . near @xmath110 , the asymptotics for @xmath105 are given by @xmath111    the function @xmath98 can be written in the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 in particular , we stress that the functions @xmath114 are easy to compute .",
    "near zero , we find that @xmath115 where @xmath116 which follows from a similar derivation to that of @xcite .",
    "moreover , behaviour near infinity in a suitable domain is described by @xmath117    these expressions again emphasise the well behaved nature of the functions @xmath114 .",
    "the ` bad ' behaviour of the kernel near @xmath110 is all contained in the function @xmath118 which has subsequently been factorised into the product of readily computable analytic functions .      in this section",
    "we solve the wiener - hopf problem given in equation ( [ plane : whunfactorised ] ) . substituting our factorised expressions for @xmath103 and @xmath114 into ( [ plane : whunfactorised ] ) , we arrive at the wiener - hopf type equation @xmath119 both sides of ( [ plane : whfactorised ] ) represent analytic functions in their respective half - planes and do not have any poles along the real axis .",
    "the asymptotic estimates as @xmath60 given in ( [ plane : phipmatinfinity ] ) , ( [ plane : xizeroinfinity ] ) and ( [ plane : xistarinfinity ] ) demonstrate that both sides of equation ( [ plane : whfactorised ] ) behave as @xmath120 as @xmath60 in their respective domains .",
    "we therefore deduce that both sides must be equal to a constant , which we denote @xmath121 .",
    "we deduce that the functions @xmath82 are given by @xmath122 these expressions validate our earlier expectations ( see equations ( [ plane : phipmatinfinity ] ) and ( [ plane : phipmatminusinfinity ] ) on page ) regarding the asymptotic estimates for @xmath123 .",
    "in particular , accurate estimates near zero are given by @xmath124 @xmath125 while as @xmath60 in the appropriate domains , @xmath126 @xmath127 it also follows from ( [ plane : formofphis ] ) that the fourier transform of @xmath64 is given by @xmath128 expressions for the transforms of the displacement jump and the mean displacement across the interface are therefore respectively given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the dimensionless mechanical contrast parameter @xmath131 these expressions will be useful in section [ plane : section : betti ] where we consider the betti identity in an imperfect interface setting .",
    "in particular we note that @xmath132 has asymptotic expansions near zero and infinity as follows @xmath133 @xmath134 the function @xmath135 behaves similarly , as @xmath136 @xmath137    another key difference between the imperfect and perfect interface ( as considered in @xcite ) cases is also readily seen here . due to the condition of continuity of displacement across perfect interfaces ,",
    "the function @xmath138 is a plus function in the perfect case , since @xmath139 is zero for @xmath15 lying along the negative real axis .",
    "however , across an imperfect interface , the displacement is no longer continuous and so @xmath140 is neither a plus function nor a minus function .",
    "in this section we refer to the physical fields for displacement and out - of - plane stress component as @xmath23 and @xmath141 respectively , and to the weight function fields for displacement and stress as @xmath64 and @xmath142 respectively .",
    "we will use the reciprocal theorem ( betti formula ) as in @xcite to relate the physical solution to the weight function .    applying the betti formula to the physical fields and to the upper and lower half plane we obtain @xmath143 and @xmath144 these identities were proved under the assumption that the integrand decays faster at infinity than @xmath145 along any ray .",
    "it is clear from the asymptotic estimates for the physical solution and the weight function given in subsections [ plane : section : physicalformulation ] and [ plane : section : weightformulation ] that this condition is satisfied . subtracting ( [ plane : bettibottom ] ) from ( [ plane : bettitop ] ) we obtain @xmath146\\}\\mathrm{d}x=0.\\label{plane : bettishort}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we split the terms for physical stress into two parts , writing @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are defined as follows @xmath150 here @xmath151 denotes the heaviside step function .",
    "the functions @xmath152 represent the prescribed loading on the crack faces . after this splitting , equation ( [ plane : bettishort ] )",
    "becomes @xmath153 we introduce notation for symmetric and skew - symmetric parts of the loading : @xmath154    this allows us to rewrite the right hand side of ( [ plane : bettilong ] ) , giving @xmath155 we now split @xmath156 into the sum of @xmath157 in the spirit of ( [ plane : splitting ] ) , and similarly split @xmath158 into the sum of @xmath159 .",
    "we will use the usual notation of @xmath160 to denote the convolution of @xmath58 and @xmath161 . rewriting ( [ plane : bettilong2 ] ) using these expressions gives @xmath162 taking fourier transforms in @xmath15 yields @xmath163 we now make use of the transmission conditions which state that @xmath164 this causes the second and third terms in the left hand side of ( [ plane : bettilong3 ] ) to cancel , leaving @xmath165 we note that @xmath166 and can therefore combine the asymptotic estimates in ( [ plane : uinfinity ] ) , ( [ plane : sigmainfinity ] ) , ( [ plane : phiminusinfinity ] ) and ( [ plane : phiplusinfinity ] ) to yield that @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "we now multiply both sides of ( [ plane : betti ] ) by @xmath169 , giving @xmath170 then , and similarly to the expression obtained for the perfect interface betti formula approach of @xcite , the left hand side now has asymptotics at infinity ( in appropriate domains ) of the form @xmath171\\ ] ] as @xmath60 , where the term in square brackets is the regularization of the dirac delta function , namely @xmath172 . integrating both sides of ( [ plane : bettibyxi ] ) , we can arrive at an expression for the constant @xmath11 in terms of known , readily computable functions : @xmath173 we note that since @xmath174 and @xmath175 behave as @xmath176 as @xmath60 , and the functions @xmath177 and @xmath178 behave as bounded oscillations as @xmath60 for point loadings , the integrand is well behaved at infinity .",
    "moreover , near @xmath110 the integrand is also sufficiently well behaved , acting as @xmath179",

    "as we stated earlier in this paper , although the methods described are applicable to any permissible loading , we will later perform computations using the specific point loading configuration shown in figure [ plane : figure : physicaldefectsetup ] on page .    for this configuration ,",
    "the loadings are defined as a point load on the upper crack face at @xmath47 balanced by two equal loads at @xmath50 and @xmath49 , that is @xmath182 the corresponding explicit expressions for @xmath183 and @xmath184 are @xmath185 which have fourier transforms given by @xmath186",

    "this problem has been solved by @xcite by approximating the loading by a linear combination of exponentials ; this approximation is however not ideal for point loadings .",
    "tractions on the upper and lower crack faces can be written as @xmath189 it follows immediately from continuity of tractions across the imperfect interface that @xmath190 we further define minus functions , @xmath191 and @xmath192 as @xmath193 we expect that the unknown functions @xmath194 and @xmath195 behave at infinity as @xmath196 from these expressions follow the relationships @xmath197 @xmath198 and also @xmath199 @xmath200 moreover , since transformed solutions are of the form @xmath201 we further have the relationships @xmath202 @xmath203 and @xmath204 these seven equations in eight unknowns reduce to the following wiener - hopf type equation relating @xmath194 and @xmath205 : @xmath206 noting that the term in braces on the left hand side of ( [ plane : antiwh ] ) is the function we earlier defined as @xmath92 and have already suitably factorised , we can write @xmath207 where @xmath208 recall that @xmath92 can be factorised in the form @xmath209 where we have defined the functions @xmath210 for the sake of notational brevity by @xmath211 which are analytic in the half planes indicated by their superscripts .",
