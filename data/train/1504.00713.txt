    "anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft - gamma - ray - repeaters ( sgr s ) are considered as special classes of neutron stars , i.e. magnetars ( @xcite ) . according to observations of rotational periods and their time derivatives , magnitudes of global dipole magnetic fields of magnetars",
    "reach about @xmath0 g . recently , however , sgr s with weak dipole magnetic fields have been found ( @xcite ) .",
    "their observational characteristics are very similar to those of ordinary sgr s but their global dipole magnetic fields are much weaker than those of ordinary magnetars .",
    "it might be explained by a possibility that such sgr s with small magnetic fields hide large toroidal magnetic fields under their surfaces and drive their activities by their internal toroidal magnetic energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent x - ray observation of magnetar 4u 0142 + 61 also implies the presence of large toroidal magnetic fields and the possibility of prolate - shaped neutron star ( @xcite ) . by considering possible growth of magnetic fields of magnetars during proto - magnetar phases ,",
    "strong differential rotation within proto - magnetars would amplify their toroidal magnetic fields ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it would be natural that some magnetars sustain large toroidal magnetic fields inside .",
    "the large toroidal fields are required from the stability analyses of magnetic fields .",
    "stability analyses have shown that stars with purely poloidal fields or purely toroidal fields are unstable ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stable magnetized stars should have both poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , the toroidal magnetic field strengths of the stable magnetized stars have been considered to be comparable with those of poloidal components ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have not yet known the exact stability condition and stable magnetic field configurations , because it is too difficult to carry out stability analyses of stars with both poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless , stabilities of magnetic fields have been studied by performing dynamical simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that twisted - torus magnetic field structures are stable magnetic field configurations on dynamical timescale .",
    "stabilities of purely toroidal magnetic field configurations or purely poloidal magnetic field configurations have been studied in the newtonian framework ( @xcite ) and in the full general relativistic framework ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite have found a stability criterion of the twisted - torus magnetic fields . it could be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ratio of the total magnetic energy to the gravitational energy .",
    "@xmath3 is the ratio of the poloidal magnetic field energy to the total magnetic field energy .",
    "@xmath4 is a certain dimensionless factor of order of 10 for main - sequence stars and of order @xmath5 for neutron stars .",
    "the ratio of @xmath2 is a small value ( @xmath6 ) even for magnetars .",
    "therefore , the criterion becomes @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the toroidal magnetic field energy .",
    "stellar magnetic fields would be stable even for toroidal magnetic field dominated configurations .",
    "therefore , it is very natural that the toroidal magnetic field strength of the stable stationary magnetized stars are comparable with or larger than those of poloidal component .    until recently ,",
    "however , almost all numerically obtained equilibrium configurations for stationary and axisymmetric stars have only small fractions of toroidal magnetic fields , typically @xmath9 , even for twisted - torus magnetic field configurations in the newtonian gravity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in general relativistic perturbative solutions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and general relativistic non - perturbative solutions under both simplified relativistic gravity ( @xcite ) and fully relativistic gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of them do not satisfy the stability criterion mentioned above .    on the other hand",
    ", there appeared several works which have successfully obtained the stationary states with strong toroidal magnetic fields by applying special boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite obtained strong toroidal magnetic field models imposing surface currents on the stellar surface as their boundary condition .",
    "@xcite imposed the boundary condition that the magnetic flux on the stellar surface should vanish .",
    "since the magnetic fluxes of their models are zero on the stellar surfaces , all the magnetic field lines are confined within the stellar surfaces .",
    "they obtained configurations with strong toroidal magnetic fields which are essentially the same as those of classical works by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and recent general relativistic works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is very recent that @xcite have found and shown that the strong toroidal magnetic fields within the stars require the non force - free current or surface current which flows in the opposite direction with respect to the bulk current within the star .",
    "such oppositely flowing currents can sustain large toroidal magnetic fields in magnetized stars .",
    "it is also very recent that @xcite have obtained stationary states of twisted - torus magnetic field structures with very strong toroidal magnetic fields using a special choice for the toroidal current .",
    "their toroidal currents contain oppositely flowing current components and result in the large toroidal magnetic fields , although their paper does not explain the physical meanings for appearances of such oppositely flowing toroidal currents .",
    "they also did not show clear conditions for the appearance of the toroidal magnetic field dominated stars .",
    "on the other hand , strong poloidal magnetic fields make stellar shape oblate one ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the strong toroidal magnetic field tends to stellar shape prolate one ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) since the lorentz force is a cross product of the current density and magnetic field , such lorentz force requires a special relation between the magnetic fields and the current density . at the same time",
    ", the large toroidal magnetic fields in stars also need a special relation between current density and lorentz force .",

    "simplified analytical models are solved and we show examples of the prolate configurations and the large toroidal magnetic fields within stars . this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formulation and basic equations are shown in sec .",
    "we present analytic solutions and the relations .",
    "we also explain the important role of oppositely flowing components of the @xmath10 currents for appearance of the prolate shapes and the presence of the large toroidal magnetic fields using the relations in sec .",

    "4 . in appendix",
    "[ app : n1 ] the deformation of stellar shape and the gravitational potential perturbation are briefly summarized .",
    "stationary and axisymmetric magnetized barotropic stars without rotation and meridional flows are analyzed in this paper .",
    "some authors have claimed that there do not exist dynamically stable barotropic magnetized stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , but in our opinion , their arguments should be applied only to _",
    "isentropic barotropes_. the magnetized barotropic stars are well defined concepts apart from the thermal stability or convective stability due to the entropy distributions and/or due to the chemical composition distributions .",
    "thus we will investigate _ mechanical equilibrium states _ of traditionally defined barotropes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) in this paper .",
    "since for such configurations the basic equations and basic relations are shown , e.g. , in @xcite and @xcite , we show the basic equations and basic relations briefly .",
    "the stationary condition for the configurations mentioned above can be expressed as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the density , the pressure , the gravitational potential of the star and an integral constant , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the magnetic flux function .",
    "@xmath17 is an arbitrary function of @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetic flux is governed by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a @xmath21-component , i.e. the toroidal component , of the current density .",
    "the spherical coordinates @xmath22 are used .    from the integrability condition of the equation of motion , the axisymmetry and the stationarity ,",
    "the following relations are derived : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the current density and the magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath10 is another arbitrary function of @xmath16 . it would be helpful to note that the above relation for @xmath10 was found by @xcite and @xcite . although @xmath27 is exactly a function of the magnetic flux function only in stationary and axisymmetric system ( @xcite ) , @xcite showed that the function @xmath27 during the dynamical evolution of magnetized configurations is nearly conserved even for non - axisymmetric systems .",
    "since the function @xmath10 and the @xmath21-component of the magnetic field @xmath28 is related as @xmath29 the toroidal current density can be expressed as : @xmath30    under our assumption that the magnetic field energy is small compared to the gravitational energy ( @xmath31 ) in this paper , the influence of the magnetic fields can be treated as a small perturbation to a spherical star .",
    "therefore , we assume that the stellar configurations are sphere and that the density profile depends only on @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 . for such situations , we can obtain analytical solutions easily . noted that self - consistent approaches such as @xcite , would reveal some differences in the magnetic field solutions . in self - consistent approaches ,",
    "we need to calculate both magnetic fields and matter equations iteratively .",
    "the stellar shape is no longer sphere and the stellar configuration affects the magnetic field configuration .",
    "however , our result in this paper is simple and might be important for both perturbative and self - consistent approaches .",
    "our aim in this paper is investigating the condition for appearance of the toroidal magnetic field dominated star analytically . noted that our solutions of @xmath16 themselves are classical and not new ones , but we use the solutions in order to show the special condition clearly .",
    "we follow mostly the formulation of the classical works ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the recent analytical works ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to obtain analytical solutions ,",
    "we choose the functional forms as follows : @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are two constants .",
    "it should be noted that these functional forms always lead to non - zero surface currents unless magnetic fields are confined inside the star .",
    "the surface current induces a lorentz force at the stellar surface ( @xcite ) .",
    "it would be unphysical because the lorentz force need to be balanced by other physics such as a crust of the neutron star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the models relying on a surface current might not be physically realistic .",
    "we emphasize that we are not asserting that surface currents themselves are necessarily significant in real stars .",
    "the surface current simply provides a mathematically convenient way of describing analytical solutions easily .    by using these functional forms",
    ", the toroidal current density can be expressed as : @xmath38 we name the first term @xmath10 current @xmath39 ( force - free ) term and the second term @xmath17 current @xmath40 ( non force - free ) term , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the equation for the magnetic flux becomes as follows : @xmath41 it should be noted that this is a linear equation for the magnetic flux function with the inhomogeneous term which contains multipoles less than the quadrupole .",
    "if we impose the boundary condition @xmath42 at the center of the star , @xmath16 is described as follows ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath43 where we set the stellar radius @xmath44 in this paper . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the spherical bessel functions of the first kind and the second kind , respectively and @xmath47 is a coefficient which is determined by a boundary condition of @xmath16 at the surface . according to the @xmath48-dependency of the inhomogeneous term , we search for solutions of the following form : @xmath49 therefore we obtain the solution for @xmath50 by imposing the boundary condition at the surface and integrating equation ( [ eq : psi_anal ] ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we treat spherical polytropes with the polytropic indices @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as for",
    "the configurations of the magnetic fields , we choose two types : ( 1 ) closed field models ( e.g. @xcite ) and ( 2 ) open field models ( e.g. @xcite ) . for closed field models , since all magnetic field lines are closed and confined within the star , the magnetic flux must vanish at the stellar surface as follows : @xmath53 for open field models , since the poloidal magnetic field lines must continue smoothly through the stellar surfaces into the outside .",
    "the boundary condition can be expressed as : @xmath54 the density profiles are @xmath55 for @xmath56 polytrope and @xmath57 for @xmath58 polytrope and @xmath59 is the central density .",
    "we can obtain four different analytical solutions according to four different situations .",
    "we name them as @xmath60 ( @xmath56 with closed fields ) , @xmath61 ( @xmath56 with open fields ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath58 with closed fields ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath58 with open fields ) .",
    "since the poloidal magnetic field lines are continuous smoothly at the surfaces for open field models , their external solutions @xmath64 must be expressed as : @xmath65            it should be noted that the poloidal magnetic fields for closed field models are discontinuous at the surfaces except for solutions with special values of @xmath37 , i.e. eigen solutions with corresponding eigenvalues ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore",
    ", these non - eigen configurations have toroidal surface currents .",
    "on the other hand , the toroidal magnetic fields for open field models are always discontinuous because of the choice of the functional form of @xmath10 ( equation [ eq : i0 ] ) .",
    "it implies that the open field configurations have non - zero poloidal surface currents .    for non - eigen solutions ,",
    "the toroidal surface current density can be expressed as follows : @xmath66 where superscript @xmath67 denotes an internal solution and @xmath68 is a coefficient of the surface current density .",
    "analytic solutions are obtained by fixing a boundary condition and integrating equation ( [ eq : psi_anal ] ) .",
    "four different inner solutions @xmath69 can be obtained according to four different situations as follows : @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath71,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath72,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the open field models ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) continue to the external solutions ( @xmath76 ) expressed by equation ( [ eq : external ] ) . here",
    "it would be helpful to explain several different kinds of characteristic solutions .",
    "first , for @xmath62 solutions there appears a singular solution at @xmath77 ( @xcite ) , while the solution @xmath78 is not singular at @xmath77 ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , although most solutions are accompanied by surface currents , some special solutions have no surface currents .",
    "we call such solutions without surface currents as eigen solutions and the values of @xmath37 as eigenvalues .",
    "third , there appear many eigen solutions as the value of @xmath37 exceeds the first eigenvalue .",
    "we call those eigen solutions as higher - order eigen solutions ( see figures in @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those solutions appear when the value of @xmath37 exceeds the first eigenvalue of @xmath37 for each situation .",
    "fourth , special solutions with different polytropic indices come to coincide with each other . in other words ,",
    "those solutions do not depend on the matter distributions . as seen from the expression for the current density",
    ", the contribution from the @xmath17 current term needs to disappear .",
    "it implies that those solutions are determined only by the @xmath10 current .",
    "since the @xmath10 currents do not contribute to the lorentz force , these solutions are called as the force - free solutions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the force - free solution is expressed by the following form : @xmath79 the solution becomes force - free when @xmath80 and 7.73 for closed models and when @xmath77 and @xmath81 for open field models .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the toroidal surface current in equation ( [ eq : j_0 ] ) vanishes when the @xmath37 is eigenvalue , i.e. , for eigen solutions .",
    "the lowest eigenvalues are @xmath82 for @xmath74 , @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 for @xmath74 and @xmath86 for @xmath75 .",
    "hereafter , we focus on solutions with @xmath37 less than the lowest eigenvalue . however",
    ", our analyses and results could be general and would be valid even when the configurations are higher - order eigen solutions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : j_r ] , distributions of the normalized @xmath87 ( thick solid line ) , the @xmath10 current ( thin solid line ) and the @xmath17 current term ( dashed line ) along the equatorial plane are shown for solutions of @xmath75 ( with @xmath88 , smaller and larger than force - free @xmath37 , respectively ) and @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 , smaller and larger than force - free @xmath37 , respectively . )",
    "we have fixed @xmath91 following @xcite in order to plot these curves .    as seen in upper panels in figure [ fig : j_r ] , directions ( signs ) of the @xmath17 current , i.e. non force - free current , and",
    "the @xmath10 current , i.e. force - free current , are the same for solutions with smaller @xmath37 .",
    "by contrast , for solutions with larger @xmath37 ( lower panels in figure [ fig : j_r ] ) , the @xmath17 current flows oppositely to the @xmath10 current ( @xcite ) . moreover , most of the @xmath87 ( thick solid line ) for solutions with @xmath92 and @xmath93 flows oppositely against the corresponding @xmath17 current .",
    "since the sign of the total toroidal current determines the sign of the magnetic flux function ( see equation [ eq : gs ] ) , this implies that the sign of @xmath94 for the whole interior region changes from @xmath95 to @xmath96 at the force - free solutions .",
    "we calculate many solutions and confirm that the the sign of @xmath94 for the whole interior region changes at the force - free solution .",
    "we call the current distribution for which @xmath96 oppositely flowing current .",
    "on the other hand , the surface toroidal currents in the closed field models are always oppositely flowing to the total toroidal currents because of the zero - flux boundary condition equation ( [ eq : closed ] ) and the form of the surface current equation ( [ eq : j_0 ] ) .",
    "as the many previous works pointed out , the toroidal magnetic fields tend to deform stellar shapes prolate , while the poloidal magnetic fields tend to deform them oblate ( @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies used only the magnetic fields in their formulations . the ideal mhd system can be described by using only magnetic fields and one does not need to mention the electrical current density at all .",
    "in contrast , we consider both magnetic fields and current density in our calculation .",
    "although these two approaches are equivalent , it is easier to interpret results physically in terms of the current density .",
    "this is the reason why we consider both magnetic fields and current density in this paper . as we have seen in the sec.3.1 , the oppositely flowing toroidal current density ( @xmath96 ) plays a key role for appearance of the large toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the direction of the toroidal current seems to relate to the stellar deformations because the lorentz force is a cross product of current density and magnetic field .",
    "we consider the relation between the toroidal current and the poloidal deformation of stars in this subsection .    in our analytic models",
    ", the lorentz force @xmath97 is expressed using the arbitrary function @xmath98 as @xmath99 following @xcite , we consider the stellar quadrupole deformations of @xmath52 polytropic stars .",
    "@xcite calculated magnetic deformations of polytorpic magnetized star with poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "although they derived the general forms of the deformations ( equation 64 , 65 & 67 in their paper ) , they did not show the analytical expressions of them explicitly .",
    "they displayed only a few numerical results in tab . 1 in their paper .",
    "by contrast , we show the analytical solutions of the deformation in order to investigate the condition for appearance of the toroidal magnetic field dominated star .",
    "we assume that the influence of the magnetic fields to the stellar structures are small and that their effects can be treated perturbatively . due to the effects of the magnetic fields , a certain physical quantity @xmath100",
    "is assumed to be expressed as @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes a small change of order @xmath103 of the quantity @xmath104 due to the lorentz force .",
    "the angular dependencies are treated by the legendre polynomial expansions and the coefficient of each legendre polynomial is expressed as @xmath105 .",
    "this expansion is also applied to the lorentz force as follows : @xmath106 from the perturbed equilibrium condition equations , the following relations can be derived : @xmath107 @xmath108 since we are interested in the quadruple deformation , we consider only @xmath109 components of lorentz force as follows : @xmath110 the change of the stellar surface to the order of the quadrupole term can be expressed as @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the deformed surface radius and @xmath113 is a small quantity which represents the fraction of the stellar surface along the pole . following this expression , the stellar shape is prolate for @xmath114 and oblate for @xmath115 .                using these equations ,",
    "the quadrupole change of the density is described by : @xmath117 since the surface of the deformed star is defined by a set of points where the pressure vanishes , i.e. @xmath118 we can derive @xmath119 for polytropes with @xmath116 . for @xmath120 polytrope",
    ", this equation is reduced to trivial relation @xmath121 and so we will treat @xmath51 polytrope differently as will be shown in the next section .",
    "therefore , the quadrupole surface deformation @xmath113 for @xmath122 is obtained by @xmath123 it is clearly seen that , since @xmath124 at the surface , the stellar deformation is prolate for @xmath125 and oblate for @xmath126 . in our situation , the explicit form of @xmath127 can be expressed as @xmath128 and @xmath113 for @xmath116 polytropes becomes as @xmath129 as shown in appendix [ app : n1 ] the gravitational change for @xmath52 polytrope can be obtained as @xmath130 thus for @xmath131 , i.e. on the surface , @xmath132 where @xmath133 is used . here",
    "the function @xmath134 is defined in appendix [ app : n1 ] .",
    "this is a analytic solution of the deformation .",
    "since the expression for the function @xmath135 is so complicated , it is not clearly seen the sign of the quantity @xmath136 which determines the sign of the quantity @xmath113 . in figure",
    "[ fig : eps ] we show the behaviors of @xmath137 and @xmath138 against the value of @xmath37 . as we have seen , the sign of @xmath94 changes at the force - free solution @xmath80 for closed model and @xmath139 for open model .",
    "as seen in this figure , the shape change from the effect due to the gravitational change is the same as that from the lorentz term .",
    "thus the sign of the quantity @xmath113 is essentially determined by the sign of the lorentz term , i.e. , the sign of the quantity @xmath140 . since @xmath141 ,",
    "the stellar shape is oblate for @xmath142 for the whole interior region and prolate for @xmath143 for the whole interior region as far as the global poloidal magnetic field is dipole .",
    "therefore , the direction of the deformation by lorentz force is determined by the direction of the non - force free current @xmath17 current ( equation [ eq : j_phi ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath144current flows oppositely to the magnetic flux ( @xmath96 ) , the stellar shape is prolate . if the @xmath17 current flows same direction ( @xmath95 ) , the stellar shape becomes oblate one .",
    "this is a deep relation between the direction of the toroidal current and the poloidal deformations of stars .    in figure",
    "[ fig : force ] , the contours of @xmath16 ( dashed curves ) and the directions of lorentz force vectors ( arrows ) are displayed . it should be noted that directions of the lorentz forces are totally opposite between models with @xmath145 ( @xmath146 and 2.0 ) and those with @xmath147 ( @xmath148 and 7.0 )      for @xmath51 polytrope , the gravitational change and the shape change are written as follows as shown in appendix [ app : n0 ] : @xmath149 and @xmath150 here we use the stationary condition @xmath151 and the surface condition equation ( [ eq : surface - condition ] ) .",
    "thus the sign of the quantity @xmath113 is exactly determined by the sign of the lorentz term , i.e. , the sign of the quantity @xmath140 .",
    "the stellar shape is oblate for @xmath142 for the whole interior region and prolate for @xmath143 for the whole interior region as far as the global poloidal magnetic field is dipole .",
    "the relation between the direction of the @xmath17 current and the poloidal deformations of stars is still valid in this case .",
    "we have found a relation between the oppositely flowing toroidal current density and the lorentz force in the previous subsection .",
    "we consider a relation between the oppositely flowing toroidal current and the strong toroidal magnetic fields in this subsection .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mt_m ] , the ratio of the toroidal magnetic field energy @xmath8 to the total magnetic field energy @xmath152 of each model is plotted for different situations .",
    "the solution becomes force - free at the point denoted by the vertical solid lines .",
    "the dashed vertical lines denote the critical values beyond which there arise oppositely flowing @xmath10 current structures dominated .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : mt_m ] , @xmath56 solutions and @xmath58 solutions cross at @xmath153 and 7.73 for closed field models and @xmath154 and @xmath155 for open field models , because the solutions at these points are force - free solutions as mentioned before .",
    "the energy ratio is @xmath156 when the solutions are the first force - free configurations .",
    "therefore the solutions are divided into two types at the force - free solution .",
    "the solution whose @xmath37 value is smaller than force - free @xmath37 is poloidal dominant configuration , while the solution with larger @xmath37 is toroidal dominant configuration .",
    "since the sign of @xmath94 changes at the force - free solution , the solution is poloidal dominant for @xmath143 for the whole interior region ( oppositely flowing current ) and the solution is toroidal dominant for @xmath157 for the whole interior region .",
    "the oppositely flowing non - force free current ( @xmath143 for the whole interior region ) is required for large toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "this is a relation between the toroidal current density and the toroidal magnetic field .      as we have shown in previous parts in this paper , there are two deep relations between toroidal current , poloidal deformation and strong toroidal magnetic field .",
    "one is a relation between the toroidal current and the poloidal deformation of stars in sec .",
    "the other is a relation between the toroidal current and the strong toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the important finding in this paper is that the appearance of oppositely flowing non force - free current which fulfills the condition @xmath158 changes the stellar shape prolate and makes the toroidal magnetic fields toroidal dominant .",
    "therefore , a well - known relation between toroidal dominant magnetic fields and prolate shapes requires the oppositely flowing non force - free toroidal current density .",
    "although our result is very simple and natural , nobody have described explicitly that the oppositely flowing non force - free current density makes the stellar shape prolate .",
    "it might be because almost all previous studies treated only magnetic fields and did not pay special attention to current density .",
    "consequently , we can conclude that a condition for appearance of prolate configurations and the toroidal magnetic field dominated configurations is that the arbitrary function @xmath98 satisfies the following condition : @xmath159 for the whole interior region when the functional forms are equations ( [ eq : mu0 ] ) and ( [ eq : i0 ] ) .",
    "although , exactly speaking , these analyses and conditions are valid within the present parameter settings , our results would be useful for more general situations .",
    "this might be naively seen from the contribution of the term @xmath160 in the stationary condition ( equation [ eq : stationary - condition ] ) .",
    "if this term is negative , it implies that the action of the lorentz term is opposite to that of the centrifugal force which is expressed by the term @xmath161 and is always positive . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic forces or lorentz forces act as if they are the anti-centrifugal forces and therefore shapes of stationary configurations become prolate ( see also calculations in @xcite ) .",
    "although the condition presented in this paper might not be always correct , we could obtain the large toroidal magnetic fields by employing this criterion for more complicated calculations .",
    "in order to get configurations with prolate shapes , we need to include the anti-centrifugal effects or anti-centrifugal potentials . as is easily understood , the anti - centrifugal potentials should behave as decreasing functions from the symmetric axis , or , at least , they must contain decreasing branches which cover wide enough regions to result in effectively anti - centrifugal actions .    for our formulation ,",
    "the following property is commonly found : @xmath162 and @xmath163 in addition to these behaviors , for @xmath164 configurations , the magnetic flux functions increase to the maximum values as the distance from the axis and turn to decrease beyond the maximum point as follows : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the location of the maximum point of the magnetic flux function @xmath16 ( left panel in figure [ fig : dpsi ] ) .    for @xmath167 configurations ,",
    "the magnetic flux functions decrease to the minimum values as the distance from the axis and turn to increase beyond the minimum point : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the location of the minimum point of the magnetic flux function @xmath16 .",
    "although there exist decreasing branches for both situations , these decreasing branches can not overcome the centrifugal effects due to the increasing branches .",
    "therefore , the global configurations with _ purely @xmath21-currents _ would become oblate shapes .    from this consideration , the anti - centrifugal forces could be realized if the following ( necessary ) condition is fulfilled : @xmath170 or @xmath171 these conditions could be realized only by including _ the @xmath10-currents _ so that the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath172 @xmath173 or @xmath174 @xmath175 the right panel in figure [ fig : dpsi ] shows the distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath176 with @xmath177 and @xmath178 . as seen in figures [ fig : j_r ] and [ fig : dpsi ] , the conditions of the above - mentioned are satisfied undoubtedly .",
    "therefore , the appearance of @xmath10 currents @xmath179 which are oppositely flowing with respect to the @xmath17 currents @xmath40 and at the same time whose magnitudes are large enough to overcome the @xmath17 currents are required to realize prolate shapes .",
    "almost all previously carried out investigations for magnetized equilibrium states having twisted - torus magnetic fields had failed to obtain toroidal magnetic field dominated ( @xmath180 ) models .",
    "we have found that most models of their works do not satisfy the condition of equation ( [ eq : condition ] ) and the magnetized stellar shapes are oblate due to the @xmath17 current term .",
    "the @xmath10 term in those works has been chosen as follows : @xmath181 where , @xmath182 is a constant and @xmath183 is the heaviside step function and @xmath184 is the maximum value of @xmath16 on the last closed field line within the star . since the current density of this functional form vanishes at the stellar surface ,",
    "there exist no surface current and exterior current density .",
    "this functional form was used by @xcite for the first time and results in the twisted - torus configurations .",
    "the same choice for the @xmath10 has been employed by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the functional form @xmath185 ( constant ) has been used in many investigations , @xcite and @xcite used a different functional form as @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are positive constants .",
    "they have obtained highly localized poloidal magnetic field configurations using this type of functional from . however",
    ", their works did not satisfy the condition of equation ( [ eq : condition ] ) and did not obtain models with large toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "recently , @xcite have adopted a perturbative approach and succeeded in obtaining magnetized equilibrium states with twisted - torus magnetic fields whose toroidal fields are large .",
    "their functional form of @xmath10 is @xmath189 on the other hand , the functional form of @xmath17 is @xmath190 \\nonumber \\\\    & + & x_0 \\kappa(\\psi ) \\d{\\kappa(\\psi)}{\\psi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 are constants .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field is confined within the last closed field line in these functional forms . outside the toroidal magnetic field region",
    ", the function @xmath10 vanishes and @xmath17 becomes @xmath194.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the first term and the second term are positive and negative , respectively , this function with larger @xmath195 tends to satisfy the condition of equation ( [ eq : condition ] ) .",
    "as they noted , larger values of @xmath195 result in larger energy ratios @xmath196 . as the value of @xmath197 increases , the energy ratio @xmath196 increases and the stellar shape becomes more prolate in general ( see tab.1 in @xcite )",
    "however , they assumed that the magnetic field configuration is purely dipole but their functional forms and toroidal current density distribution are far from dipole one ( see bottom panels of figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "non - perturbative studies with higher order components were unable to reproduce their results and found contradictory results ( @xcite ) .",
    "we need to calculate magnetic field configurations with higher order components for large toroidal models by using non - perturbative methods in the future .",
    "the condition of equation ( [ eq : condition ] ) itself is valid when a star is barotropic .",
    "however , the relation between oppositely flowing toroidal current density and prolate share is very simple and natural when a star is non - barotropic .",
    "therefore , this condition is also useful for recent perturbative non - barotropic solutions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also need to investigate non - perturbative non - barotropic magnetized equilibrium states in the future .      in this paper , we have obtained four analytic solutions with both open and closed magnetic fields for spherical polytropes with weak magnetic fields .    using the obtained solutions we have discussed the situations for which the prolate equilibrium states and the toroidal magnetic field dominated configurations appear .",
    "the main finding in this paper is that the appearance of the prolate shapes and the toroidal magnetic field dominated states are accompanied by the appearance of oppositely flowing @xmath10 currents with respect to the @xmath17 current .",
    "this situation seems to be related to the condition for the non force - free toroidal current contribution , i.e. @xmath198 , in the stationary state condition equation ( [ eq : stationary - condition ] ) .",
    "although the appearance of prolate shapes and the occurrence of toroidal magnetic field dominated states can not be defined quantitatively , the rough qualitative idea about them can be determined by checking the sign of the magnetic field potential , i.e. the quantity @xmath199 .",
    "of course , the analytic solutions obtained in this paper have been derived under very restricted assumptions . however , as explained in the discussion , the concept of the anti-centrifugal actions due to the magnetic potentials would be applied to more general situations for the magnetic fields .",
