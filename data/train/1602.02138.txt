    "equation ( [ pce ] ) has a rich variety of periodic and non - periodic solutions .",
    "it exhibits coexisting periodic solutions if the range of variation , or amplitude of @xmath3 is limited .",
    "we also show that an expanded range or greater amplitudes for @xmath3 leads to the occurrence of coexisting non - periodic solutions ( including chaotic solutions ) as well .",

    "when @xmath2 is odd different periodic and non - periodic stable solutions are generated from different pairs of initial values ; see corollary [ op ] and theorem [ oddgen ] below .",
    "but if @xmath2 is even and the amplitude of @xmath3 is less than 2 then theorem [ peven ] shows that asymptotically stable @xmath2-cycles occur in a generic fashion , i.e. independently of initial values .    such differences in behavior among the solutions of ( [ pce ] )",
    "are readily explained by a semiconjugate factorization of ( [ pce ] ) into a triangular system of two first - order difference equations .",
    "the latter pair of equations determine the full structure of ( [ pce ] ) and allow us to explain the aforementioned variety of behaviors that its solutions exhibit as follows : one of the two first - order equations has periodic , hence bounded solutions when @xmath2 is odd ; see lemma [ ptk ] .",
    "however , if @xmath2 is even then the solutions of the same first - order equation are unbounded ( except for a boundary case ) ; see lemma [ pet ] and the remarks following it .",
    "thus the corresponding _ bounded _ solutions of ( [ pce ] ) forget \" the initial values and approach a single asymptotically stable solution .",
    "the paper is divided into sections that highlight the natural dichotomy that exists between odd and even periods .",
