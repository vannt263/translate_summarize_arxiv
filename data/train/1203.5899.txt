    "phospholipids are amphiphilic molecules with a hydrophilic head group and one or more hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains , and are the major constituents of biomembranes .",
    "they self - assemble in water to form a variety of thermodynamic phases , depending upon the temperature and water content  @xcite .",
    "the most common of which is the lamellar phase , a periodic structure consisting of lipid bilayers separated by layers of water .    above the chain melting transition ( also known as the _ main - transition _ ) temperature @xmath0",
    ", phospholipids form the fluid @xmath1 phase , where the hydrocarbon chains are disordered with many _ trans - gauche _ isomerizations in their c - c bonds .",
    "positional order in the plane of the bilayer is liquid - like in this phase .",
    "the lower temperature gel ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) phase is characterized by flat bilayers with the hydrocarbon chains predominantly in the fully - stretched all - trans conformation . in the @xmath3 phase",
    "the chains are tilted relative to the bilayer normal , whereas in the @xmath2 phase there is no such tilt .",
    "the presence of a tilt depends on the relative cross - sectional areas of the head group and chains of the lipid species  @xcite .",
    "for example , phosphatidylcholines display a tilt angle of about 30@xmath4 while phosphatidylethanolamines with relatively smaller head groups do not show any tilt .",
    "phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholines ( pc ) exhibit a modulated phase between the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 phases at high water content  @xcite .",
    "this is known as the @xmath5 or the ripple phase , and is characterized by a one - dimensional periodic height modulation of the bilayers . in this phase the hydrocarbon chains are partially ordered and have a non - zero tilt relative to the bilayer normal . the first order @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath6 transition is well understood in terms of the melting of some of the degrees of freedom within the hydrocarbon chains  @xcite .",
    "however , the first - order @xmath3  @xmath5 transition ( often called the _ pre - transition _ ) , which occurs at a temperature slightly below the main transition , is much less understood .",
    "the structural features of the ripple phase have been extensively studied using a variety of techniques such as , x - ray diffraction ( xrd )  @xcite , neutron diffraction  @xcite , freeze - fracture electron microscopy  @xcite , and scanning - tunneling microscopy  @xcite .",
    "these experiments have revealed the existence of both _",
    "symmetric _ as well as _ asymmetric _ ripples .",
    "asymmetric _ structure is , however , thermodynamically more stable and is commonly reported in almost all x - ray studies on pc systems .",
    "the wavelength of the ripples typically lies in the range of 12 - 16 nm  @xcite and the peak - to - peak amplitude is about 2 nm .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns from this phase can be indexed on a two dimensional oblique lattice and the rippled bilayers lack a mirror plane normal to the rippling direction .",
    "calculations of the electron density distributions  @xcite confirm the basic asymmetry of the ripples , and indicate that the bilayer thickness is appreciably different in the two arms of the ripple .",
    "the absence of a mirror plane normal to the ripple wave vector in the asymmetric ripple phase can be attributed to the presence of asymmetry in either the _ shape _",
    "( i.e. , one arm being longer than the other ) or _ bilayer thickness _ ( with a higher bilayer thickness in one of the arms ) or both .",
    "however , in almost all the systems studied so far both these features are present simultaneously .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to describe the ripple phase  @xcite , but none of them account for all the experimental observations , namely ,    occurrence of the @xmath5 phase between @xmath1 and @xmath3 phases , separated by two first - order transitions ;    unequal bilayer thickness in the two arms of the ripple ; and    unequal lengths of the two arms .",
    "macroscopic continuum theories , which treat the bilayer as a continuous membrane , can broadly be classified into two main categories depending on the nature of the order parameter that is chosen to describe the ripple phase .",
    "one set of theories considers the order parameter to be a _",
    "scalar _ , such as the membrane thickness as in the models by falkovitz _ et.al _",
    "@xcite , marder _ et.al _  @xcite and by goldstein and leibler ( gl )  @xcite or the configuration of the hydrocarbon chains ( ratio of cis to trans bonds in the chains )  @xcite . due to the scalar nature of the order parameter",
    ", these models can not distinguish the different symmetries of the @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 phases .",
    "further , in these models the ripple phase is characterized by a bilayer thickness modulation and not a height modulation .",
    "the other set of continuum theories considers the order parameter to be a _ vector _ , such as the tilt of the hydrocarbon chains with respect to the local layer normal , as in the lubensky - mackintosh ( lm )  @xcite and the seifert - shillcock - nelson models  @xcite .",
    "although models involving vectorial order parameter can predict the various phases with different in - plane symmetries , they have their own limitations . for example",
    ", the lm - model can not account for the occurrence of the ripple phase in bilayers composed of achiral molecules and speculated that the the origins of the experimentally observed asymmetric ripples lay in the chirality of lipid molecules .",
    "however , subsequent experiments using racemic ( achiral ) mixtures showed this was not the case  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a phenomenological landau model to describe the ripple phase , that unifies the two distinct approaches ( those using scalar and vector order parameters ) used in the earlier models .",
    "in addition to the coupling between the curvature of the bilayer to the divergence of the molecular tilt  @xcite , we bring out the importance of the coupling of variation in the bilayer thickness to molecular tilt and show that the    asymmetry of the ripple phase arises from    the difference in the bilayer thickness in the two arms of the ripple ,    unequal length of the two arms ,    existence of a nonzero mean tilt of the hydrocarbon chains of the lipid molecules along the direction of ripple .    in section ii we present the model for single - component achiral membranes .",
    "the main results of this section has already been reported in a short communication @xcite . in section iii",
    "we extend the model to two - component membranes and use it to calculate the phase diagrams for various binary lipid mixtures . in section",
    "iv we present the phase diagram of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ( dppc ) - dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine ( dmpc ) mixtures determined from small - angle x - ray scattering studies of aligned samples .",
    "the experimental phase diagram is found to be in good agreement with the one calculated using our model .",
    "in this section , we develop a phenomenological model for describing the asymmetric ripple phase in achiral membranes . to simplify matters , we ignore interbilayer interactions and choose to describe the ripple phase in terms of    a scalar order parameter @xmath7 , which represents the relative bilayer thickness and    a vector order parameter * m * , which is the projection of the molecular axis in the plane tangent to the bilayer surface ( fig.([tlt_m ] ) )  @xcite .",
    "we consider three distinct contributions to the total free energy density :    a. : :    the main transition is characterized by the freezing of the lateral motion as well as conformational ordering of the hydrocarbon chains .",
    "many experiments have revealed that at the main transition there is a discontinuous jump in the membrane thickness  @xcite .",
    "therefore , following gl , we describe the main transition as one involving a change in the bilayer thickness and introduce a dimensionless scalar order parameter @xmath7 , such that : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the actual membrane thickness , @xmath10 is the constant thickness of the membrane in the @xmath1 phase and * r * denotes the lateral position within the bilayer plane .",
    "no specific assumption is made about the microscopic state of the lipids in choosing @xmath7 as the order parameter ; we can think of @xmath7 as a hybrid coarse grained variable that summarizes changes in various types of degrees of freedom , like for example , conformational changes of the hydrocarbon chains .",
    "@xmath7 is taken to be positive for @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath0 due to the stretching of the chains .",
    "this is valid in general , even if the chains are tilted below @xmath0 .    the stretching free energy per unit area , for an isolated lipid bilayer membrane ,",
    "can therefore be written as  @xcite ; @xmath13 the explicit temperature dependence is assumed to reside solely in the coefficient of @xmath14 : @xmath15 @xmath16 being a reference temperature ( which in the absence of the cubic term in @xmath17 is the critical temperature ) . since",

    "the equilibrium phases are always spatially homogeneous ; either as @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( @xmath23 . however , with @xmath24 modulated phases are possible with some characteristic wave vector @xmath25 . to motivate how @xmath26 can be negative ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary scalar variable @xmath27 .",
    "constructing effective cylinders enclosing the head group and the chain with cross - sectional areas @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , we define @xmath30 .",
    "consider a bilayer membrane whose thickness @xmath7 increases steadily over a length scale @xmath31 .",
    "this variation in thickness produces a strain at the molecular level .",
    "this can be accommodated both by a variation in the tilt @xmath32 , and a variation in the mismatch @xmath27 over this scale . the latter coupling to",
    "lowest order is of the form @xmath33 .",

    "b. : :     represents the orientation of the long axis of the lipid molecules relative to @xmath34 , the bilayer normal .",
    "the projection of @xmath35 on the bilayer plane @xmath36 is the order parameter . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the components of @xmath39 along the two orthogonal directions in the plane of the bilayer . ]",
    "the tilt free energy density can then be written in terms of @xmath39 as , @xmath40 first and second terms in the above equation represent the coupling of the molecular tilt vector * m * to the bilayer thickness and modulations in the thickness , respectively .",
    "the third term corresponds to the splay deformation of the * m * field and represent the tilt elasticity in the tilted phase .",
    "since the order parameter * m * is a vector , cubic terms in * m * are not allowed .    as shown by jacobs",
    "_ et.al _",
    "@xcite in the context of a one dimensional model with a scalar order parameter , a term in the fourth power of the gradient of the order parameter is necessary to stabilize a modulated phase with a non zero mean value of the order parameter .",
    "hence we include @xmath41 and @xmath42 terms in our expression for stretching free energy density and the tilt free energy density , respectively .    as @xmath43 is positive in our model , the term involving the coefficient @xmath44 , which couples the molecular tilt to the change in the bilayer thickness , is the most crucial one for the appearance of the asymmetric ripple phase .",
    "when @xmath44 @xmath45 0 , the stable phase below @xmath0 is @xmath46 with @xmath47=0 . on the other hand , tilted phases can form if @xmath44 @xmath12 0 .",
    "the succeeding two terms take into account the anisotropy of the tilted bilayer .",
    "the next two terms represent higher order couplings between modulations in @xmath7 and in @xmath48 , allowed by the symmetry of the system .",
    "these higher order coupling terms are kept merely for consistency and are not crucial for obtaining the optimal phases .    c. : :    the curvature energy density of the bilayer can be written as  @xcite ; @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the height of the bilayer relative to a flat reference plane , @xmath51 is the bending rigidity of the membrane , and the coefficient @xmath52 couples the mean curvature to splay in * m*. + the total free energy density is given by the sum of the above three contributions : @xmath53 the equilibrium height profile of the bilayer @xmath50 is related to the tilt * m * via the euler - lagrange equation , @xmath54 eliminating @xmath55 from the free energy density @xmath56 leads to the effective energy density @xmath57 with a reduced splay elastic constant .",
    "@xmath58 thus , the effective free energy density is given by , @xmath59    to determine the mean field phase diagram we assume that the modulated phase is characterized by the most dominant wave vector q , and choose the following ansatz for @xmath7 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 with the amplitudes @xmath62 as variational parameters .",
    "we retain fourier components of @xmath37 to second order to account for the ripple asymmetry ; the experimentally observed asymmetric ripple profile is obtained if @xmath63 . in principle",
    ", one could have done a numerical variational calculation with many more fourier components . however , our simplified ansatz is sufficient to recover all the qualitative features of the experimentally observed asymmetric ripple phase .",
    "2d modulations of the membrane  @xcite was not included in our ansatz ( eqn.[[ansatz ] ] ) , since earlier studies  @xcite based on a similar free energy density for the tilt and curvature alone , show that the presence of a mean tilt suppresses two dimensional height modulations .",
    "the additional @xmath7 dependent terms in the free energy density do not alter this conclusion .",
    "hence we confine our attention to one - dimensionally modulated ripples .",
    "note that spatial modulations in @xmath38 are neglected as we do not keep terms proportional to @xmath64 in eqn.([f_tlt ] ) .",
    "variation of @xmath38 with @xmath65 represents non - parallel orientations of the lipid chains , which are not favored by van der waal s interactions between the chains .",
    "such terms are important in chiral systems , where they can lead to structures with non - zero winding numbers  @xcite . in the absence of chirality , these terms can , however , be neglected .",
    "the average free energy is obtained by integrating the @xmath66 over one spatial period , i.e , @xmath67      the phase diagram in the c - t plane is obtained from the numerical minimization of the effective free energy @xmath68 .",

    "depending on the value of @xmath81 three distinct modulated phases are found , with differing spatial variations of the order parameters ( fig.[g7-t ] ) . for @xmath81",
    "@xmath12 0 , the @xmath85 phase is stable , where the height profile is asymmetric and resembles very closely those seen in experiments ( fig.[fig : opsg7 - 150 ] )  @xcite . in this phase @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is almost @xmath103 out of phase with h , so that it is positive ( negative ) along the longer ( shorter ) arm of the ripple , resulting in different bilayer thicknesses in the two arms , again in agreement with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath81 is weakly positive , the @xmath104 is obtained ( fig.[fig : opsg7100 ] ) , where the higher fourier components of @xmath37 are absent ( @xmath105 ) and hence the height profile is symmetric . as in the @xmath85 phase the bilayer thickness is different in the two arms .",
    "this profile resembles the structure reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the diffraction data of ref .",
    "@xcite . for higher values of @xmath81 the @xmath106",
    "is found ( fig.[fig : opsg7150 ] ) , where @xmath107 . the height profile is symmetric and is almost in phase with @xmath102 . as a result , the bilayer thickness is modulated within each arm of the ripple .",
    "this novel structure does not seem to have been observed in any experiments till now .",
    "however , since the electron density map of the ripple phase has been calculated only in a few instances , the possible occurrence of this structure in some systems can not be ruled out .",
    "the present model predicts the chain tilt to be high in the thicker arm and negligible in the thinner one .",
    "there are in principle at least two chain conformations consistent with this thinner arm of the bilayer ",
    "one is by having disordered chains , the other by chain interdigitation . since in our model ,",
    "the high temperature phase was identified as @xmath6 , it is natural to populate the thinner arm with disordered chains .",
    "we therefore propose that in the asymmetric ripple , the thicker arm is made up of tilted gel - like domains and the thinner one is fluid - like with negligible chain tilt .",
    "this conclusion is partially supported by spectroscopy and diffusion experiments , which indicate a significant fraction of disordered chains in the ripple phase @xcite .",
    "however , it must be acknowledged that there is no direct experimental data on the spatial distribution of the disordered chains within the rippled bilayer .",
    "electron density maps calculated from diffraction data do not provide any direct information about chain ordering .",
    "in contrast , recent computer simulation studies of the ripple phase using a variety of model lipids at different levels of coarse - graining @xcite , find an asymmetric ripple structure consistent with the height and thickness modulations seen in the electron density maps , with the thicker arm consisting of gel - like domains , and the thinner one made up of ordered and interdigitated chains .",
    "the cross - over region between these two contains a large fraction of disordered chains . in the gel - like domains chains",
    "are tilted with respect to the local layer normal , whereas chain tilt vanishes in the thinner arm due to interdigitation .",
    "thus the height , thickness and tilt modulations found in these simulations are consistent with the predictions of the present model , although the thinner arm consists of interdigitated chains instead disordered chains as proposed here .",
    "symmetric ripples consisting of alternating gel - like and fluid - like domains have also been found in some simulations @xcite .",
    "these ripples are characterized by only a thickness modulation and no height modulation .",
    "stacks of such bilayers will result in a centered rectangular lattice and do not seem to have been observed in any pure lipid - water system .",
    "biomembranes are multicomponent , including lipid species that show liquid - ordered behavior , and are likely to have thickness variations @xcite .",
    "the first step in understanding such complex systems is to study binary mixtures of lipids which differ in their head groups and chains .",
    "therefore , in this section , we extend the model presented in the previous section for single component membranes to membranes consisting of two lipid species .",
    "we specifically consider two different cases . in case 1",
    ", only one of the lipids exhibits the ripple phase . since the occurrence of the ripple phase",
    "is closely related to the formation of a tilted gel phase at lower temperatures , one of the lipids is assumed to show the phase sequence @xmath6 @xmath83 @xmath5 @xmath83 @xmath3 , and the other to show @xmath6 @xmath83 @xmath2 on cooling .",
    "this case corresponds to two species differing only in their head groups . in case 2 , both the lipids exhibit the ripple phase , and corresponds to the situation where the two lipids differ only in the length of their hydrocarbon chains .",
    "we employ an approach quite similar to that used in ref  @xcite and ignore any lipid exchange with the surrounding solvent .",
    "owing to the fact that the lipids constituting the mixture can have different chain lengths , degrees of saturation , or head groups , the main transition temperature is taken to be different for the two lipids .",
    "due to the presence of an additional component in the system there is a contribution @xmath108 to the total free energy , corresponding to the free energy of mixing .",
    "@xmath108 is given by the sum of the entropy of mixing and enthalpy , which within the bragg - williams ( mean - field ) approximation can be written as , @xmath109+\\frac{1}{2}j\\phi\\:(1-\\phi ) \\label{f_mix}\\ ] ] where , @xmath70 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath110 is an attractive interaction parameter that enhances lipid - lipid demixing .    since the important properties of the lipids are mainly reflected in the model parameters @xmath16 , c and @xmath44 , we assume their values for a mixture to be the average of that for the two pure lipids weighted by their concentration .",

    "the main qualitative difference from the previous case is the large region of @xmath3 - @xmath2 coexistence at lower temperatures .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the case where both the constituents exhibit the ripple phase between the @xmath6 and @xmath3 phases .",

    "these regions are separated by two coexistence regions of @xmath6 - @xmath5 and @xmath5 - @xmath3 phases . as @xmath127 is increases to @xmath129 ( fig.[fig : tt_j4 ] ) , these coexistence regions almost touch each other , confining the @xmath5 phase to a narrow strip . with further increase in the value of j (= 5.0@xmath130 ) two - phase coexistence regions dominate the phase diagram with the pure phases confined to compositions close to the two pure lipids . for this value of @xmath127",
    "the two lipids show a miscibility gap in the @xmath6 phase , with the appearance of a critical point .",
    "as discussed in the next section , the calculated phase behavior at low values of @xmath127 closely resembles that observed in mixtures of very similar lipids .",
    "although the complex phase diagrams calculated for high values of @xmath127 have not yet been reported in experiments , we believe that such phase behavior should be seen in binary mixtures of very dissimilar lipids , such as those with hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon chains .",
    "small angle scattering techniques can in principle detect microscopic phase separation in the plane of bilayers , if there is sufficient contrast in the scattering densities of the two phases .",
    "however , even in the absence of such contrast , macroscopic phase separation can easily be detected from non overlapping reflections in the diffraction pattern coming from the individual phases .",
    "on the basis of the diffraction patterns we have determined the partial phase diagram of the binary mixture consisting of dppc and dmpc .",
    "the use of oriented samples has an advantage that the in - plane ordering of molecules can be easily inferred from the wide angle reflections .",
    "for example , in the gel phase of both dppc and dmpc , one observes two wide angle reflections , one on - axis ( @xmath131 ) and the other off - axis ( @xmath132 ) , coming from the quasi hexagonal lattice of hydrocarbon chains of the lipid molecules .",
    "the positions of these peaks indicate that the molecules are tilted with respect to the bilayer normal and that the direction of the tilt is toward nearest neighbor  @xcite .",
    "1,2-dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dppc ) and 1,2-dimyristoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dmpc ) were purchased from avanti polar , and were used as received .",
    "aligned multibilayers of binary lipid mixtures were prepared as follows : a concentrated solution of dppc - dmpc binary mixtures ( dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and methanol ( 1:1 ) ) in designated molar ratios was deposited on the outer surface of a clean cylindrical glass substrate ( radius of curvature of  9 mm ) . after deposition , the samples were placed overnight under vacuum to remove any remaining traces of the solvent .",
    "subsequently , they were kept in a water - saturated atmosphere and were hydrated for a couple of days to obtain a stack of bilayers oriented parallel to the surface .",
    "cu @xmath133 ( @xmath134 1.54  ) radiation from a rotating anode x - ray generator ( rigaku , ultra x18 ) operating at 48 kv and 70 ma and rendered monochromatic by a multilayer mirror ( xenocs ) was used to illuminate the hydrated sample kept inside a sealed chamber with two mylar windows .",
    "the chamber temperature was controlled using a circulating water bath to an accuracy of @xmath135 0.1 @xmath4c and the relative humidity ( rh ) inside it was maintained at @xmath136 , by keeping a reservoir of water .",
    "the axis of the cylindrical substrate was oriented perpendicular to the incoming x - ray beam , such that the beam is incident tangentially to the sample .",
    "diffraction patterns were recorded on a 2d image plate detector of 235 mm diameter and 0.1 mm pixel size ( marresearch ) .",
    "all the samples were first heated to a temperature above the main transition temperature of dppc and the diffraction patterns were recorded during cooling from the l@xmath137 phase .",
    "the sample temperature and the rh close to the sample were measured with a thermo - hygrometer ( testo 610 ) inserted into the chamber .",
    "we have developed a continuum theory of phase transitions in single- and two - component achiral lipid bilayers .",
    "this model is found to reproduce all the salient structural features of the ripple phase occurring between the fluid @xmath6 phase and the gel @xmath3 phase .",
    "in addition , it predicts the existence of a novel variant of this phase , which has not been experimentally observed so far . this theory has been used to calculate some generic phase diagrams of binary phospholipid mixtures . we have also determined the phase diagram of dppc - dmpc mixtures from x - ray diffraction studies on aligned multilayers .",
    "it is found to be in good agreement with that calculated from the model for weakly segregating species ."
