    "for this reason , the identification of the gc system has come in fits and starts , with the first confirmed gc identified by @xcite , and handfuls of gcs found throughout the balance of the 1980s and into the 1990s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . with the turn of the millennium ,",

    "[ sec : conc ] . throughout this work",
    "we adopt a distance modulus for ngc5128  of @xmath27 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in this contribution , as well as the results and discussion based on it , are formed upon the scabs dataset presented and described in paperi .",
    "we begin with the catalogue of sources with near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and optical @xmath1 photometry and morphological properties produced by the scabs data reduction procedures .",
    "these data consist of @xmath28 sources with complete sets of @xmath1 photometry , all with on - sky coordinates corresponding to the inner @xmath0 of the centaurus a galaxy group , reaching out to @xmath29kpc in galacto - centric radius from ngc5128  ( see fig.[fig : dither ] ) .",
    "altogether , this rich dataset is exploited to identify point - like and marginally resolved sources , the numbers of which are reduced by two orders of magnitude to reveal a large catalogue of likely gcs as described in the following .",
    "this section describes the process of converting the calibrated scabs images into catalogues of point - like and marginally resolved sources from which a gc candidate list is selected .",
    "the distance to ngc5128  of 3.8mpc corresponds to a physical scale of 18pc/@xmath30 .",
    "given gc sizes of @xmath31pc ( @xmath32 ) with a typical average half - light radius of @xmath33pc ( @xmath34 ) , and typical psf fwhm of @xmath35 in all bands during our observations , we expect most gcs to be point - like or marginally resolved with sizes accounting for @xmath36 percent of their psf fwhm , or @xmath37 percent for an average gc at @xmath38 fwhm .          a common strategy for identifying gcs in galaxy systems outside of the local group is to exploit their relatively limited colour dispersions via colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "for example , h12 used this technique recently to discover @xmath17 new gc candidates around ngc5128  using @xmath18 and @xmath19 photometry . while this strategy is useful as a first guess , @xcite recently showed the dramatically increased effectiveness of identifying gcs in colour - colour diagnostic space covering the nuv to near - infrared ( nir ) sed range . presently , there is no matching wide - field nir photometry available for ngc5128 , so here we combine the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 filters from our survey which maximize the separation of gcs from background objects and , in particular , foreground stars .",

    "the key to this selection technique lies in the inclusion of the nuv @xmath39-band fluxes .",
    "while the effective temperatures of cool stars and red giant branch ( rgb ) populations are probed by the @xmath43 colour , the @xmath42 index straddles the @xmath44  break and is thus sensitive to hot stellar populations in star - forming galaxies and/or hot horizontal branch ( hhb ) stars in gcs .",
    "the @xmath39-band flux contributed by hhb stars thus makes gcs appear bluer in @xmath42 than foreground stars at a given @xmath43 , while the redshift evolution of galaxy seds leads to the diffuse population towards redder @xmath43 colours at a given @xmath42 . finally , since a canonical stellar initial mass function ( e.g.  salpeter imf or chabrier imf ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dictates that the stellar mass of a gc is dominated by cool , low - mass stars , their contribution to the overall light is weak compared to those near the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) and the rgb , leading to the clear separation of gcs from the plume of stars seen at redder @xmath43 , while being more similar at the msto .",

    "the median @xmath124mag colour of the inner red gcs is @xmath125mag bluer than the @xmath126mag median @xmath127 colour expected of a giant galaxy sharing ngc5128 s @xmath128mag luminosity in a cluster environment , and more consistent with a ge galaxy with @xmath129 in the range @xmath130 to @xmath131mag and @xmath132mag @xcite .",
    "a merger of such galaxies would produce a combined luminosity of @xmath133 to @xmath134mag .",
    "interestingly , this luminosity range brackets ngc5128 s luminosity , consistent with the notion that ngc5128  experienced a roughly equal mass merger in the recent past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "still , the prevalence of blue gcs in the halo of ngc5128  out to @xmath135 requires an explanation even if they were brought in during the merger event .    the new and h12 candidates within @xmath94 together with the confirmed gcs implies an intrinsic total population of at least 1126 .",
    "we can then calculate the specific frequency as defined by @xcite , @xmath136 adopting a de - reddened @xmath137-band luminosity of @xmath138 with eq.[eq : sfreq ] gives @xmath139 , a value not unreasonable for a giant e / s0 galaxy @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig : gcdense ] , the red gc component follows the inner halo light of ngc5128  closer than the blue gcs , which extend well out into the @xmath75 halo with a shallower @xmath63 profile .",
    "this is consistent with other high @xmath140 galaxies , in that they tend to have higher @xmath113 , with metal - poor ( blue ) gcs preferentially following more radially extended , shallow distributions and extending further out than the host s underlying starlight @xcite .",
    "while the consistency with previous works is encouraging , the relatively high @xmath113  calls for an explanation of its origins .",
    "the number of blue gcs that need to be accounted for is simply , @xmath141 if minor mergers with ngc5128 s giant progenitors represent the sole sources of the blue gcs , then the number of former dwarfs , @xmath142 , of a luminosity , @xmath143 , needed to build up such population is approximated by the number of gcs that each galaxy can be expected to contribute , @xmath144 . from the definition of @xmath140 , then trivially , @xmath145 which can be simplified given @xmath113@xmath146 for the 1126 `` intrinsic '' ngc5128  gcs to , @xmath147    taking approximate @xmath148 for a dwarf at a given @xmath149 from the rich compilation of @xmath140 derived for dwarf galaxies in the local universe by @xcite , table[tbl : dwarfs ] shows the approximate numbers of dwarfs of a given @xmath149 that would be required to fully account for the inner blue gcs detected .",
    "also listed are the magnitudes of the combined dwarf progenitors , and the fraction of ngc5128 s current luminosity that such a reservoir of dwarfs would contribute .",
    "while the numbers are rough approximations , it is illustrative that a reservoir of @xmath150 @xmath151-class dwarfs is sufficient to provide the blue gcs , but insufficient to build up a significant fraction of ngc5128 s current luminosity .",
    "meanwhile , between dozens and @xmath152 @xmath153-class dwarfs are required to provide such blue gc population , and could have contributed up to @xmath154 percent of ngc5128 s light .",
    "we note that if a smaller number of @xmath155-class dwarfs is responsible , this would be sufficient to build up ngc5128 s total luminosity , but would not provide a means of explaining the origins of the red gc population .",

    "distributions more top - heavy than unity ( @xmath189 ) tell a similar story , with @xmath190 in all cases . for @xmath191 , we find that the increased fractions of blue gcs provided by lower - mass dwarfs sufficiently explain the gc population , while providing a fraction of ngc5128 s current day light on the order of 3060 percent . at more bottom - heavy dwarf lfs ( @xmath192 )",
    ", the number of bright dwarfs would be expected to be zero , with @xmath193 @xmath151-class dwarfs being required to provide the blue gcs , while providing only a small fraction of ngc5128 s current spheroid light .",
    "altogether , these results suggest that a faint - end lf slope of @xmath194 is consistent with the build - up of ngc5128 s intrinsic population of blue gcs .",

    "interestingly , @xcite find that if the virgo ucds are assumed to be the remnants of nucleated dwarf galaxies stripped of their outer stellar halos ( and thus gcs ) , they find a much steeper slope of @xmath198 , which appears inconsistent with our results . with that said , our gc selection procedure intentionally filtered out objects encroaching upon ucd luminosities , and so a future dedicated search for ucds in the outer halo of ngc5128  may result in a promising reservoir of additional blue gc progenitors .",
    "most of the dwarfs contributing to the inner population of gcs are likely to have merged with ngc5128  and/or its giant progenitors in the past , but the same can not necessarily be assumed for the extreme outer halo of ngc5128 . in this way , carrying out the exercise above with the 2162 gc candidates of the `` intra - group '' population serves as a rough prediction on the population of dwarfs that have either already been disrupted , or may still be present in the extreme halo .",

    "any dwarfs of similar luminosities , but more diffuse morphologies and/or projected along less - fortunate axes ( assuming triaxial structures ) , would therefore still remain undetected , as would more massive satellites with yet more diffuse stellar distributions . with",
    "that said , @xcite detected clear signals of loops and streams that indicate that dwarfs are still being actively disrupted to the present day out to at least @xmath203 ( @xmath204kpc ) , thus it is likely that past dwarf galaxy interactions may be behind the population of blue gcs at such distance from ngc5128 .",
    "such interactions have recently been shown to produce preferential stripping of gc systems @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of fig.[fig : btr_dense ] is the existence of several @xmath205-scale structures dominated by red gcs , highlighted by shaded ellipses and labelled ` a ' , ` b ' , and ` c ' . the most significant ( ` a ' ) lies @xmath206 to the nw of ngc5128  and the existence of these gcs , along with those that make up the two red over - densities at @xmath207 and @xmath208 ( labelled `",

    "these gc overdensities may have origins in giant background galaxies or distant galaxy clusters , but visual inspection of the images shows no obvious evidence for possible background hosts .",
    "evidence that the kinematics of the inner halo gcs shares similarities with the overall kinematics of the centaurus a group suggests that the outer halo of the group is dynamically connected to the rest of the group @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the notion that ngc5128  has primarily been built up by minor mergers , with only a few major mergers contributing seems to be consistent with the present findings . while the results of the previous section support a recent merger of two equal - mass giants , it does not rule out a more ancient merger whose evidence is no longer detectable . in this case",
    ", these clumps could represent the last coherent structures resulting from these violent events . on the other hand , the recent discovery of `` ultra - diffuse '' galaxies ( udgs ) in large galaxy clusters @xcite have been proposed to represent failed @xmath209 galaxies with deep potentials relative to their stellar masses .",
    "little is known about their respective gc systems , but recent work has indicated that they may have high @xmath210 with as many as dozens of gcs @xcite .",

    "the gc system as a whole shows a larger number ratio of blue gcs with respect to red , i.e.  @xmath113@xmath212 .",
    "evidence is presented for distinct populations inside and outside of @xmath135 and we suggest that the inner population is likely intrinsic to ngc5128  itself , while the outer population begins to sample those gcs that are likely associated with the intra - group environment .",
    "the inner sample shows a slightly higher @xmath113@xmath213 , compared to @xmath214 for the outer , noting that the outer sample is likely to be more strongly affected by a bias against blue gcs due to our selection process .",
    "no evidence for a trimodal colour distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is found in our data , likely due to our vastly larger sample size .",

    "this trend reverses outside of @xmath217 , as the blue gcs show a slightly steeper power - law relation .",
    "overall , the spatial distribution of ngc5128 s gc system is not uniform .",
    "a two - point angular correlation function analysis provides evidence for clustering on all scales below @xmath123kpc for the inner population , with red gcs showing stronger clustering toward smaller scales .",
    "mild evidence for a reversal of this trend is seen for the outer population , as the blue population shows slightly stronger evidence for small - scale clustering , consistent with the notion that they may be hinting at an as - yet unknown population of low surface - brightness dwarf galaxy hosts .",
    "alternatively , they might be the last remaining coherent structures from previously disrupted dwarf satellites , as observed in the local group @xcite .",
    "both red and blue outer gc samples show a much more shallow decline of @xmath99 , suggestive of clustering at larger scales than found in the inner population .",
    "finally , we find mild evidence for a coherent over density , or stream , of gcs outside of @xmath135 , which will be statistically quantified in a future work .",
    "the median @xmath218mag colour of the blue component is consistent with what is expected for a ge galaxy of similar luminosity in the virgo cluster @xcite , while the @xmath219mag colour of the red component is consistent with a build up from two giant galaxies each on the order of @xmath220 to @xmath221mag .",
    "based on the observed numbers of blue gcs within @xmath217 of ngc5128 , if the assumption is made that they all have origins in dwarf haloes , this would require dozens of minor - mergers with @xmath222-class dwarfs during the assembly of ngc5128  and its giant progenitors .",
    "likewise , if the outer population of blue gcs is to be explained by dwarf halo hosts , then yet more low - mass dwarfs are either possibly lying undetected , or have already been disrupted within @xmath3kpc of ngc5128 .",

    "<S> we present new , wide - field _ dark energy camera _ observations covering @xmath0 centred on the nearby giant elliptical galaxy ngc5128  in the five optical @xmath1 filters . with filter - dependent 90 percent point - source completeness depths of @xmath2 mag ( ab ) </S>",
    "<S> , we combine optical colours with source morphologies to compile a new catalogue of 2676 globular cluster ( gc ) candidates , of which 2404 are newly identified , and that includes the vast majority of globular clusters within @xmath3kpc of ngc5128 . </S>",
    "<S> evidence is presented for a transition from gcs `` intrinsic '' to ngc5128  to those likely to be part of the intra - group medium of the centaurus a galaxy group at a galactocentric radius of @xmath4kpc . inside this transition radius , we find that the red gc subpopulation is more centrally concentrated than the blue , with surface number density profiles of the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the median @xmath7mag colour of the `` intrinsic '' population is consistent with arising from the amalgamation of two giant galaxies each less luminous than present - day ngc5128 . both in- and out - ward of the transition radius </S>",
    "<S> , we find the fraction of blue gcs to dominate over the red gcs , indicating a lively history of minor - mergers during ngc5128 s past . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the blue gcs to have origins primarily in dwarf galaxies , we model the population required to explain them , while simultaneously remaining consistent with ngc5128 s present - day spheroid luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that several dozen dwarf galaxies of luminosities @xmath8 , following a schechter luminosity function with a faint - end slope of @xmath9 is favoured , the majority of which are likely to have already been disrupted in ngc5128 s tidal field .    </S>",
