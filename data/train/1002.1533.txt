    "the big - bang singularity is a prediction of classical general relativity and it must be removed in the final theory .",
    "this feature causes concentration of the community on the regimes that the general relativity ( gravity ) is the dominant field with a very high density . from the other side",
    "our knowledge of quantum physics says that in this regime due to enormous density of a field the classical physics is broken and quantum fields become essential .",
    "the big - bang and the black - hole are theoretical evidences of quantum gravity , challenge the final theory ( at least its gravity sector ) . until now different approaches to quantize gravity have grown up e.g. string theory @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "for such candidates or any given new theory it is very crucial to be falsifiable i.e. it must have some non - trivial accessible predictions , besides the compatibility with their classical counterparts . however due to complexity of quantum gravity",
    "it is so hard to calculate any physical prediction comparing to the experiments . to make this comparison possible",
    "the test theories are needed which fill the gap between the full theories predictions and the experiments .",
    "these test theories should possess the structure of the main theories as much as possible .",
    "also there is ( are ) another layer(s ) between the full quantum gravity theories and test theories which is ( are ) named falsifiable `` quantum gravity theory of not everything '' @xcite .",
    "these theories make it possible to transit the great gap between test theories and full theories step by step . as an example noncommutative geometry @xcite can be mentioned .    as one of the candidate to model quantum gravity effects is a deviation @xcite from the standard dispersion relation among energy and momentum of a particle ( lorentz violation ) i.e. @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are energy , momentum s norm and mass of the particle , respectively . actually , it is well - known that modification in dispersion relation can appear as a consequence of discretization of space - time on a lattice @xcite .",
    "observationally in some cases the modified dispersion relation s imprints can be found in cosmic ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "this deviation can be represented by a modification in the dispersion relation such that @xmath4 as a famous example @xcite . however , this form of deformation is not a unique choice e.g. introducing a cubic term has been studied in details @xcite and a more general form in @xcite which contains an observer independent length beside velocity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 is a factor proportional to the minimum length @xmath6 that makes the semi - classical limit to standard form of dispersion relation trivial due to exiting from quantum gravity regime by taking @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this prediction is a candidate to go further in the phenomenology of quantum gravity @xcite . as mentioned in the above ,",
    "the phenomenological aspects of quantum gravity is a controversial issue in theoretical physics . though it is arguable to suppose that the regime of quantum gravity does not make any senses to do some repeatable experiments by humankind but it is believable to accept domination of quantum gravity in early universe",
    ". therefore illustration of this regime may shed some lights on the nature of quantum gravity .    in general to achieve properties of a physical system , knowledge of the dynamical rules besides",
    "the correct initial conditions , are needed . for our universe",
    "the common believing is that the initial state is a quantum gravitational state due to domination of gravitational field in the very early times .",
    "this state has reached to the present state such that the universe contains the particles and also in lack of the quantum effects of gravity .",
    "so the question is that how the particle - full universe has risen up from an unknown initial quantum gravitational state ?",
    "note that the initial state is an unknown state at least at the present .",
    "but as it is usual , with the similar predictions the simpler choice is the better choice .",
    "at least in lack of any knowledge about the correct initial state , the simpler choice makes the theory calculable resulting in a general understanding of the theory however it is not complete .",
    "the simplest choice for the initial state is the vacuum state , if it does not fall in a trivial prediction .",
    "if this simplest choice can predict non - trivial particle - full present status of the universe then the result is very interesting and remarkable .",
    "note that the vacuum state is not only the simplest choice but also is a special choice .",
    "this choice makes the proposal of creation from nothing meaningful @xcite .",
    "the idea of vacuum creation theory has been considered also in different aspects such that under the action of strong fields it is possible to create particle - anti particle plasma system @xcite . as mentioned in @xcite the time dependent masses can cause particle creation that makes these kind of models comparable to our model which has a time dependent dispersion relation .    in this work , in a toy model we have shown that the above argument can be obtainable . to construct our toy model",
    "we pick up the method of particle creation in the context of the quantum field theory in curved space - times @xcite .",
    "the deformed dispersion relation is used to model the quantum gravitational field i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "we will propose that the quantum gravity parameter @xmath5 has a time dependence such that for very early times be one and vanishing for late times .",
    "this evolution behavior is appropriate to study the effects of very early quantum gravity in present time .",
    "but it should be mentioned that the function of @xmath8 is taken arbitrarily , in lack of any full quantum gravity , such that the equations become solvable analytically .",
    "it is generally believed that the notion of particle and as a consequence the notion of vacuum in quantum field theory is not a straightforward manner specially in curved space - times .",
    "the crucial part of the definition of states in field theory is the selection of the basis .",
    "a field can be expanded due to the appropriate basis @xmath9 as follow @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a complex number , @xmath12 and @xmath2 are four - vectors of position and momentum respectively . in the minkowskian space - time",
    "the choice is trivially @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "the next step is the quantization that is being constructed by transition from complex number coefficients @xmath11 to their corresponding operators @xmath15 and consequently @xmath16 to @xmath17 , such that the commutation relation @xmath18=i \\hbar \\delta_{ij}$ ] is satisfied by @xmath15 and @xmath17 . due to this relation @xmath15 and @xmath17",
    "can be interpreted as annihilation and creation operators .",
    "finally an @xmath19-particle state with momentum @xmath2 , @xmath20 , is being defined by @xmath21 . in the above we reviewed very quickly the structure of definition of states containing particles . as mentioned before the starting point is definition of the appropriate basis that is not trivial for curved space - times @xcite . in general cases",
    "the symmetries can help in defining the useful basis .",
    "this rapid review was needed entering to our model .",
    "in our model we will suppose a minkowskian space - time as the background but the dispersion relation is different for two sides of the time interval .",
    "for the very early times , i.e. for @xmath22 , it has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lorentz violation parameter represents the quantum gravity regime in our model . and",
    "for very late times , i.e. @xmath25 , the dispersion relation becomes the standard one , @xmath26 . for the late times",
    "the natural choice of the basis is @xmath27 where @xmath26 .",
    "but for the early times these basis are not the suitable ones since the dispersion relation @xmath26 has not any significance in this time region .",
    "the natural alternative for this region of time is @xmath28 where @xmath29 . since the definitions of basis for these two different regions are not equivalent then the equivalence of the vacuum s notion for them is not a trivial concept and must restudy again .",
    "this feature can cause a deviation from the initial vacuum state and the final vacuum state .",
    "this deviation can be interpreted as particle creation during transition from initial to final state .",
    "note that this kind of interpretation is a standard one in quantum field theory in curved space - times @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study this concept .",
    "to do more , supposing the time evolution of the lorentz violation parameter is @xmath30 where @xmath24 is the initial value of the lorentz violation parameter and the general behavior is such that the parameter for the early times and the late times satisfies our above propositions .",
    "otherwise , the form of the function is picked only to make the equations exactly solvable .",
    "it must be noted that the origin of this form of time dependence has not been discussed in this work and it seems that this subject belongs to the quantum gravity and specially that branch discussing on the semi - classical limit of quantum gravity .",
    "we consider a mass - less scalar field without any loss of generality . to reach to the klein - gordon equation it is sufficient to replace @xmath1 and @xmath31 in the dispersion relation by their operator form @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "so the klein - gordon equation becomes @xmath34\\varphi(x)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is position four - vector .",
    "letting @xmath35 reduces the above equation to @xmath36t_k(t)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 .",
    "the solution of the above second order differential equation is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hypergeometric function and @xmath40 to go further we concentrate to the behavior of the both infinite limits . at the first for the very early times , @xmath41",
    ", the above solution reduces to @xmath42 where the identity @xmath43 for arbitrary @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 is used @xcite .",
    "the result is fully in agreement with our expectation since for the very early times the energy is @xmath47 .",
    "so the first term in ( [ -solutions ] ) can be interpreted as the temporal part of @xmath48 that we will need it in the following calculations . for the second infinite limit , the very late times , the solution becomes more complicated such that    the parameter @xmath49 is positive then the plot is not shown for the forbidden region where the @xmath50 is imaginary ( in this case @xmath51 represents forbidden region).,width=377 ]    @xmath52\\times e^{-i \\omega_{out}\\hspace{.5 mm } t}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[c_1 \\frac{\\gamma(c)\\gamma(b - a)}{\\gamma(b)\\gamma(c - a)}+c_2 \\frac{\\gamma(c^*)\\gamma(a^*-b^*)}{\\gamma(a^*)\\gamma(c^*-b^*)}\\right]\\times e^{+i \\omega_{out}\\hspace{.5 mm } t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the gamma function .",
    "the important point in the above solutions is that for incoming waves @xmath54 there is a combination of the two terms of the general solutions ( [ solutions ] ) i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 both appear in the coefficient of the incoming waves and the same is true for the outgoing waves .",
    "this means that the vacuum state of the very early universe , @xmath57 , does not coincide to the vacuum state of the very late times , @xmath58 . as mentioned before , this interpretation is a standard interpretation in the subject of quantum field theory in curved space - times @xcite . for continuing we must calculate the bogolubov coefficients , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , as the following @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath12 is the position four - vector .",
    "note that @xmath48 and @xmath62 are the first terms in relation ( [ field ] ) corresponding to annihilation operator for @xmath63-region and @xmath64-region respectively .",
    "the non - vanishing @xmath60 results in incoincidence vacua for @xmath63-region and @xmath64-region e.g. in our model , the very early times and the very late times respectively . in mathematical language due to relation ( [ -solutions ] ) in our model @xmath65 is the first term in relation ( [ solutions ] ) times @xmath66 i.e. it contains only the @xmath55 factor .",
    "but for the @xmath64-region the result is more complicated such that due to relation ( [ + solutions ] ) , @xmath67 equals to a combination of both of terms in ( [ solutions ] ) .",
    "the temporal part of the solutions for both of the @xmath63- and @xmath64-regions are @xmath68 such that by taking the limits , the above solutions reduce to the first terms in their counterpart relations ( [ -solutions ] ) and ( [ + solutions ] ) , the combination has picked up such that the above relation reduces to its asymptotic counterpart in ( [ + solutions ] ) . ] .",
    "note that in the above results the prefactors guaranties the normalization of the basis .",
    "the second bogolubov coefficient contributes to show the spectrum of the created particles with respect to the energy i.e. the @xmath69 is the number of particles with energy @xmath2 , is in the following form @xmath70 the above result can be deduced by some algebra ( see the appendix ) from definition of bogolubov coefficients ( [ bog ] ) that has been used for relations ( [ -+ ] ) .",
    "the figures show the above number density spectrum for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "now let us examine the behavior of the result in well known limits . for @xmath71",
    "the expectation is , vanished @xmath72 due to no difference between the early and late times . obviously since in this case",
    "@xmath73 it causes vanishing  @xmath74 \" in the numerator of the fraction results in vanished @xmath72 , as expected .",
    "another point is that we have two different choices for @xmath24 , a positive one and a negative one .",
    "it must be noted that for the positive one , we must restrict the plots to an upper - bound for @xmath2 s since for the greater values of @xmath2 , @xmath50 becomes an imaginary number that makes no sense in our conclusions .",
    "but for the negative values of @xmath24 the spectrum is valid for all the @xmath2 s .",
    "the figure 1 shows the behavior of the @xmath72 with respect to @xmath2 for a positive @xmath75 . in this case as mentioned before , there is a forbidden region due to non - real values of energy @xmath50 .",
    "the second figure presents the spectrum of the number of created particles with respect to their energy but for two negative values of @xmath75 .",
    "it is obvious from the plots that in this case , the maximum of the spectrum is changed by different values of lorentz violation parameters .",
    "the energy , that has the maximum number of created particle , decreasing due to increasing of the absolute value of @xmath24 . in this case for smaller value of @xmath24 the plot falls and for @xmath76 it coincides to @xmath77 for all @xmath2 s , as one expected .",
    "this plot is for two negative @xmath75 with no forbidden region .",
    "the solid line presents the spectrum of created particles for @xmath78 and the dashed line for @xmath79.,width=377 ]",
    "we have studied a toy model to describe the effects of lorentz violation in particle creation subject @xcite in presence of a time dependent deformed dispersion relation . in this paper , we have shown that the existence of lorentz violation in very early times vacuum can result in the existence of particles but in the absence of any lorentz violation . in the other words",
    "we have combined two legitimate individual ingredients , modification of the dispersion relation @xcite and time variation of a fundamental parameter @xcite , to peruse any interesting features . according to above discussions and close relation between lorentz violation and quantum gravity a suggestion",
    "can be introduced that : quantum gravitational vacuum causes a particle - full state in classical gravity .",
    "this final state is obtainable by making a semi - classical limitation process .",
    "these particle - full states are obtained by taking semi - classical limits of quantum gravitational vacuum .",
    "this means particles are only some excitations of quantum gravitational vacuum , that is not an obsolete idea in theoretical physics @xcite . in this viewpoint ,",
    "the particles are the evidences of the past existence of lorentz violation ( or , quantum structure of the geometry ( gravity ) ) .",
    "the above argument is totally in agreement with some kinds of interpretation of wave function in quantum cosmology such that  probabilistic evolutionary process \" interpretation @xcite . since our model is a toy model and far from complete quantum gravity theory , then to see the correctness of our proposal in this paper we need waiting until full quantum gravity theory .",
    "this can also shed lights on the origin of the time - dependence of lorentz violation parameter that is an ambiguity in our model .",
    "finally , it is again worth to mention that in our model only the lorentz violation is picked up presenting the quantum gravity regime . to discuss more accurate we need to study all the quantum gravitational effects in the presence of the curved background and its dynamics .    at the end",
    "it is proper to consider that the origin of the present particles and even the large scale structures can be explained by proposing an inflationary era in the early universe @xcite .",
    "maybe it causes to think that the inflationary scenario makes the results of this paper irrelevant .",
    "but it is important to note that the inflationary era is not the first stage after the big - bang where quantum gravitational effects are dominant @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is that the created particles by lorentz violation are just before the inflationary era i.e. in contrast to the standard approach in inflationary models the initial state for this era is not vacuum state . in this viewpoint @xcite the natural question will be how one can find any traces of these particles after inflationary era in the last scattering surface or even at present time ?",
    "it seems that at least in our model since the old particles are created by a geometric effect then they show themselves by a geometric feature e.g. gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this way of thinking is still open and in this work we did not consider this problem e.g. the effects on cmb temperature fluctuations and etc .",
