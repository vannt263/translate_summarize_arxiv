    "the idea of exploiting the laws of hydrodynamics to describe the expansion of the strongly interacting matter created in high energy collisions was pioneered by landau in 1953 @xcite . in recent years",
    ", data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) provided striking evidence for a strong collective expansion that is in good quantitative agreement with hydrodynamic predictions .",
    "moreover , these data emphasized the exciting possibility that the qcd matter created in the collisions shows properties of a near - perfect fluid .",
    "once well - calibrated ideal fluid dynamical benchmarks have been established under appropriate experimental conditions , deviations from perfect fluid behavior can be used to explore transport properties , such as viscosities and heat conductivities of the qcd matter . if unambiguously extracted from data , they are prime candidates for the next compilation of the particle data group @xcite .",
    "such efforts are among those that define the present forefront of research in heavy - ion collision dynamics .    the results at rhic also indicate that the matter created in heavy ion collisions behaves like a strongly coupled liquid rather than a weakly interacting plasma of quarks and gluons . in this case , the mit bag model that effectively includes strong interactions via a bag constant can be of use as an equation of state .",
    "recently , the bag model has taken an interesting turn with the detailed analysis @xcite of the lattice data @xcite .",
    "the surprise of this analysis is that at zero chemical potential it reveals a term quadratic in temperature as the leading correction to the ideal gas term in the pressure .",
    "the recent data @xcite also indicate that this is generic : that the equation of state of the original bag model gets modified as    @xmath0    as noted , the novelty is the @xmath1 term , while the remaining two are the standard bag terms , with b a bag constant and @xmath2 a parameter .",
    "a common choice is to take @xmath2 from perturbation theory up to one loop order .",
    "@xmath3 is close to a critical temperature @xmath4 ( or some approximate ",
    "@xmath4  for a crossover ) .",
    "a small difference between @xmath4 and @xmath3 may vary with the model .",
    "@xmath5 is set by perturbation theory such that to leading orders it is applicable only for temperatures higher than @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , there are arguments in the literature @xcite that in qcd long perturbative series ( or the uv renormalons ) result in the so - called quadratic corrections . from this point of view , the @xmath1 term in is nothing else but an example of the quadratic correction . in the dual ( string ) description , these quadratic corrections are parameterized in terms of the metric in extra dimensions and do result in the @xmath1 term for the pressure @xcite .    what is the physical significance of such a modification ? in the present paper , we look into how it affects the early space - time evolution of the qcd matter and why it may be relevant to some attempts to extract dissipative transport coefficients from data .    in general",
    ", the @xmath6-dimensional hydrodynamic equations are very complicated and require powerful numerical simulations . here",
    ", we consider a simplified model which , however , is a good approximation to the early time evolution of the qcd matter .",
    "it incorporates several characteristic features of heavy ion collisions , while lacking many of the technical complications of the most general case .",
    "moreover , it allows us to find analytic solutions .",
    "this is the fluid dynamical model proposed by bjorken @xcite .    in this @xmath7-dimensional model , introducing the milne variables proper time @xmath8 and space - time rapidity @xmath9 , boost invariance simply translates to requiring all hydrodynamic variables to be independent of rapidity . as a result ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations become exceptionally simple @xcite .",
    "to first order in the gradient expansion , one has    @xmath10    with @xmath11 given by their navier - stokes values . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients , respectively .    in order for the equations and to be closed , one has to specify an equation of state @xmath14 and expressions relating @xmath12 and @xmath13 to @xmath15 .",
    "the simplest case to be considered is that of a perfect fluid , @xmath16 , with a bag model type equation of state , eq . at @xmath17 .",
    "if so , then the evolution equation can be solved analytically .",
    "one gets    @xmath18    with the initial condition @xmath19 .",
    "this is the celebrated bjorken solution @xcite which defines the baseline on top of which dissipative and fuzzy bag effects have to be established .",
    "certainly , deviations must be sufficiently small for the gradient expansion underlying dissipative hydrodynamics to be valid .",
    "in the absence of dissipative effects , the entropy per unit of rapidity is a constant of the motion @xcite .",
    "therefore the entropy density is    @xmath20    for the fuzzy bag , we can still obtain an explicit formula for @xmath21 by solving a cubic equation .",
    "so we get    @xmath22\\quad & \\text{if $ \\tau\\leq\\sqrt{\\frac{54}{\\alpha^3}}c$}\\,,\\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}\\alpha}\\ , \\cos\\bigl[\\frac{1}{3}\\arccos\\bigl(\\sqrt{\\frac{54}{\\alpha^3}}\\frac{c}{\\tau}\\bigr)\\bigr]\\quad&\\text{if $ \\tau\\geq\\sqrt{\\frac{54}{\\alpha^3}}c$ } \\ , , \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 .",
    "the solution emerges in the limit @xmath24 , as expected .    in figure 1",
    "we show the proper time evolution of the temperature and energy density for the bag and fuzzy bag models . following our discussion on the fuzzy bag ,",
    "we choose the initial temperature to correspond to @xmath5 and stop the evolution at @xmath25 .",
    "it is expected on general grounds that @xmath3 is somewhere between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while @xmath5 is around @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with the recent lattice data for qcd with almost physical quark masses in the interval @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "so , we take the initial temperature @xmath30 to be @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting that this value is expected to be reached in the coming years as the lhc goes into its heavy ion program .",
    "given @xmath30 , the initial time can be estimated by using the uncertainty principle @xcite : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "this results in @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we consider the early time evolution where the bjorken model is a good approximation .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is fixed from the slopes for the regge trajectory of @xmath36 mesons and the linear term of the cornell potential @xcite . for @xmath37 ,",
    "it is given by @xmath38 . finally , the value of the bag constant is set to @xmath39 .",
    "what we see from this figure is that the temperature decreases with the proper time more slowly in the presence of the @xmath1 term in the equation of state .",
    "note that the bag constant has no effect on the evolution of the temperature .",
    "thus , the bjorken solution is also valid for a conformal fluid .",
    "the maximum discrepancy occurring at @xmath40 is of order @xmath41 .",
    "it rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath42 and becomes almost negligible for @xmath43 .    for practical purposes , the expression looks somewhat awkward . a possible way out is to expand it in a series and then see where that takes us .",
    "if we ignore all higher terms in the small @xmath35 expansion , which is equivalent to the small @xmath42 expansion , then a final result can be written in a simple form    @xmath44    here the second term represents the leading @xmath35-correction to the bjorken solution . since its value is positive , the slowing down of the temperature decrease occurs ( at least for small @xmath42 ) . in figure 1 we have plotted the proper time dependence of the temperature as it follows from .",
    "remarkably , with our initial conditions , the difference between and is negligible in the interval @xmath45 .",
    "finally , let us discuss the evolution of the energy density .",
    "in the fuzzy bag model it is given by @xmath46 . in the appendix . ] because of the minus sign in front of the @xmath1 term , one would expect that the energy density will fall faster in the presence of the @xmath1 term . in reality , the effect of the slowing down of the evolution of @xmath47 dominates and , as a consequence , the energy density falls slower in the fuzzy bag model than in the original one .",
    "we illustrate this in the right panel of figure 1 .",
    "one of the most fascinating developments in recent years has been the conjecture @xcite that there may be a fundamental bound from below on the ratio of the shear viscosity @xmath12 to the entropy density @xmath48 . ]",
    "@xmath49    given the conjectured existence of the bound , it is natural to ask how closely does the qcd matter ( fluid ) produced at rhic ( lhc ) approach the bound .",
    "while some methods provide consistent support for a conclusion that the produced matter is within a factor of @xmath50 above the conjectured bound @xcite , controversy still remains @xcite .",
    "we now wish to understand whether the modification of the original bag model will affect the conclusion .      in the case of the mit bag model",
    ", the solution of the evolution equation is known analytically for @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite    @xmath53      \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 .",
    "the second term is a viscous correction .",
    "it shows that the temperature decreases with the proper time more slowly in the presence of the shear viscosity .",
    "now , a problem arises . for @xmath55",
    ", the function grows with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "this is unphysical .",
    "what it means is that dissipative effects are large and , as a consequence , the first order theory is not applicable any more . to proceed , therefore",
    ", we need to pick the initial time in such a way that @xmath56 .",
    "together with @xmath57 @xcite , this results in the following constraint @xmath58 .",
    "since the value of @xmath59 is approximately @xmath60 , it obeys the constraint .",
    "moreover , it is possible to consider larger values of @xmath61 ( up to a factor of @xmath62 ) . finally , let us note that the situation is opposite for the solution , where the problem of small @xmath42 does nt occur .    from our discussion",
    "so far , when the bjorken solution defines a baseline , the slowing down of the evolution of the temperature occurs if either the equation of state gets modified or the shear viscosity coefficient is not set to zero .",
    "a natural question arises : what is dominant ?",
    "we can gain some understanding of this by plotting the curves given by equations and .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we see that the function decreases with @xmath42 more slowly .",
    "indeed , at the beginning of the evolution process it is comparable with the function at values of @xmath61 below @xmath59 , while at the end it becomes comparable with that at greater values exceeding @xmath59 .",
    "also note that for @xmath63 the functions are almost indistinguishable in the interval @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to understand why it is so .",
    "the reason for this is contained in the formulas and .",
    "the function goes to @xmath65 as @xmath66 , while the function goes to @xmath67 .",
    "we will return to this issue in section vi .",
    "thus , what we have learned is that these effects have the same sign and both are significant in the interval of primary interest @xmath68 .",
    "we consider the early time evolution @xmath69 , where the bjorken model is a good approximation .",
    "in such a situation , our conclusion is likely to be reliable in heavy ion collisions as well .",
    "if so , it should be taken seriously by those who will try to extract the value of the shear viscosity from the lhc data and shed some light on the conjectured bound .",
    "the formula is oversimplified for various reasons .",
    "for one thing , the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients must be included in the evolution equation .",
    "a common way to do so is to set @xmath70 to a constant and @xmath13 to zero @xcite . for the window @xmath29",
    ", it gives a good approximation for the evolution .",
    "but this level of accuracy is sufficient nether for the next compilation of the particle data group nor for shedding the light on the lower bound .",
    "first , we will discuss the shear viscosity .",
    "like in atomic and molecular physics , the ratio @xmath70 depends on @xmath47 . in the temperature interval of interest",
    "it is an increasing function .",
    "although there is strong evidence for this from lattice simulations @xcite , the limited data do nt allow one to suggest any reasonable parametrization .",
    "on the other hand , in an alternative approach based on the soft wall metric model of ads / qcd a simple formula was derived in @xcite . for @xmath71 , it is    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is a positive constant and @xmath35 is given by .",
    "the reason for this is that the model was also used to derive the equation of state @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we have not normalized to @xmath63 .",
    "the situation seems to be better with the bulk viscosity .",
    "according to @xcite , @xmath13 can be related with the qcd trace anomaly , yielding for high temperatures @xmath74 .",
    "this conclusion is attractive because it agrees with what can be drawn from lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the lattice data are well fitted by @xcite    @xmath75    here @xmath76 is a positive constant and @xmath35 is introduced for dimensional reasons .",
    "this state of affairs , together with the evolution equation , means that we can combine the viscous terms as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 .",
    "there is an obvious question .",
    "can the ratio @xmath79 , which is dependent of @xmath47 , cancel the @xmath47 dependence of @xmath70 ?",
    "note that this is not merely a problem with the choice of fitting functions .",
    "it is a more general phenomenological problem .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 is an increasing function of @xmath47 , while the ratio @xmath79 is a decreasing function of @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , if one combines these two , a cancellation among `` @xmath47 dependencies '' can happen .",
    "we have no real resolution of this problem .",
    "all what we can do is to illustrate it with an example .",
    "we do so in figure 3 . here",
    "we take @xmath80 at @xmath63 as it follows from the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath81 at @xmath82 that is of course below the conjectured lower bound on @xmath70 of @xcite but above @xmath83 of @xcite . with the same values of parameters in as those of @xcite , we have @xmath84 at @xmath85",
    ". then we make an estimate of @xmath86 .",
    "surprisingly , it is one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "we see therefore that @xmath87 is a slowly varying function of @xmath47 :        there is a small difference between the conjectured value of @xmath63 and @xmath87 .",
    "the maximum discrepancy occurring at @xmath82 is of order @xmath88 . for comparison ,",
    "note that it becomes of order @xmath89 for @xmath70 .",
    "having determined the viscosity coefficients , we can now consider the evolution equation .",
    "combining and , we get    @xmath90    we can not unfortunately solve this equation analytically but we can do it numerically .",
    "figure 4 shows         the time dependence of the temperature for our initial conditions @xmath91 , @xmath34 .",
    "we also take @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in fact , to see significant effects on @xmath21 , the absolute value of the parameter @xmath94 must be increased by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that we can look for a solution which is a double power series in @xmath35 and @xmath61 .",
    "we begin by expanding the solution in powers of @xmath35 . to first order",

    "now we want to show that , with different choices of @xmath87 , more solutions can be found analytically .",
    "these seems to be mainly of academic interest .",
    "let us first consider the mit bag model with    @xmath100    here @xmath101 is a positive constant .",
    "one can think of this as a consequence of the fact that the model has @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the solution to the evolution equation is easily found to be    @xmath104    in fact , it can be added to a list of those in @xcite as a special case @xmath105 .",

    "<S> three subjects are considered here : the relativistic hydrodynamics equations for a boost - invariant expanding fluid ; the fuzzy bag model for the pressure which recently appeared in qcd phenomenology ; and the early space - time evolution of the qcd matter , drawn from model studies , which can also be expected to arise in realistic fluid dynamics relevant to heavy ion collisions at lhc . </S>"
