    "a material law postulating a relation between the temperature and the heat flux is required .",
    "the classical way to do this consists in using fourier s law of heat conduction stating @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the heat conductivity being a material property . plugging equation ( [ fourier_law_linear ] ) into ( [ conservation_law_linear ] )",

    "for some other physical applications , the infinite speed of signal propagation arising from equation ( [ linear_heat_conduction_fourier ] ) is a significant drawback .",
    "in particular for these , the following assumption @xmath15 is more realistic from a physical point of view stating that the heat flux notices changes in temperature ( gradient ) not instantaneously , but with some delay .",
    "the latter leads to the so - called heat equation with pure delay @xmath16 in addition to severe problems caused by the loss of regularity , equation ( [ linear_heat_conduction_delay ] ) turns out to be ill - posed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . one way to overcome this problem is to `` equivalently '' rewrite equation ( [ delay_law_linear ] ) as @xmath17 and perform a _",
    "formal _ taylor expansion of order one with respect to @xmath18 ( cp .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath19 to finally obtain @xmath20    in the present paper , we propose another approach to regularize equation ( [ linear_heat_conduction_delay ] ) .",
    "for a small parameter @xmath21 , we replace equation ( [ delay_law_linear ] ) with @xmath22 and arrive at a regularized heat equation @xmath23 though equation ( [ linear_heat_conduction_delay_regularized ] ) is much better behaved than equation ( [ linear_heat_conduction_delay ] ) , standard results on semigroups for delay equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) still can not be applied since the delay term is no low order perturbation of the term without delay .",
    "a semigroup treatment of this problem nevertheless turned out to be possible . in @xcite ,",

    "in particular , it was shown for the case of @xmath34 being a linear differential operator and containing terms of the same order as @xmath25 that the problem possesses a unique mild solution , i.e. , a function @xmath36 , @xmath2 , satisfying the integral equation @xmath37    in @xcite , a similar problem was studied in the strong case , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "namely , the authors considered an abstract linear delay equation of the form @xmath39 where @xmath25 is a generator of an analytic semigroup on a hilbert space @xmath40 .",
    "a typical example of such equation is given by @xmath41 under certain assumptions on the operators @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , the well - posedness followed from the existence of a semigroup associated with the flow @xmath45 .",
    "in @xcite , the authors elaborated on these results by carefully studying the @xmath46-regularity of the corresponding solution in certain weighted and interpolation spaces and presenting a characterization of the infinitesimal generator .",
    "an @xmath47-treatment of delay differential equations with unbounded operators acting on delay terms for @xmath48 was given in @xcite .",
    "in particular , a well - posedness result was obtained for the following problem @xmath49 where @xmath25 is an elliptic operator of order @xmath50 and @xmath51 is an integro - differential operator of the same order .",
    "recently , hyperbolic partial differential equations have also gained a lot of attention . in @xcite , a wave equation with an internal feedback incorporating a delay in the velocity field",
    "was studied .",
    "the initial boundary value problem @xmath52 subject to appropriate initial conditions , where @xmath53 are relatively open with @xmath54 , was shown to possess a unique strong solution , which is exponentially stable if @xmath55 or instable , otherwise .",

    "this stability study was later carried out in the case of time - varying internal or boundary delay , i.e. , @xmath56 , in @xcite , @xcite , etc .    to the authors best knowledge ,",
    "no well - posedness results are available for the case of the delay in laplacian for higher - order in time systems . at the same time , replacing stabilizing feedbacks by their delayed counterparts are sometimes known to even lead to ill - posedness of the resulting system as shown in @xcite for the wave - equation and the euler & bernoulli beam .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath58 for an arbitrary unbounded operator @xmath25 possessing a sequence of eigenvalues @xmath59 , @xmath60 , or the hyperbolic - parabolic thermoelasticity with pure delay in the second order elliptic part ( s. @xcite ) @xmath61 in the following , we propose a natural solution approach in hilbert spaces which employs a generalization of the classical step method for ordinary delay equations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) rather than the delay semigroup theory .",
    "in addition to its simplicity and constructivity , our approach allows for nonhomogeneous boundary conditions under rather weak regularity assumptions on the boundary data .",
    "the latter is very useful for various applications in control theory ( cf .",

    ", we make essential amendments to the method from @xcite to show that lower order regularizations lead to ill - posedness like in the case with pure delay , also for higher - order systems .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite for a study on necessary conditions for the well - posedness of partial differential equations with delay .    to give an illustration , we apply our theory to get a closed form solution to a one - dimensional practical problem related to short - pulse laser heating of metal nanofilms with physically relevant constants .",
