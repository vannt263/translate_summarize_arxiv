    "@xcite , where it is shown how the designability of a heteropolymer increases with the total number of possible bonds for each bead ( valence ) and decreases with the conformational entropy per bead .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to assume that directionality ( the patches ) combined with isotropic interactions would increase designability , because the valence ( i.e. the total number of possible bonds ) remains constant , while the conformational entropy per bead decreases .",
    "in fact , the introduction of the patches decreases the entropy by favouring the system to populate more specific structures with the patches along particular directions .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the number of patches increases to much , the interactions become again close to isotropic and the designability decreases again . hence",
    ", a model is needed that explicitly brings about the designability from a basic heteropolymer model by controlling the alphabet size and the conformational entropy per particle .    here",
    "we will use the patchy polymer model  @xcite that has already been proven to be effective to refold artificial sequences into unique target structures for some specific cases of configurations of the patches . with patchy polymers we are able to change both the alphabet size of the isotropic interactions , the number of directional interactions incrementing them from the heteropolymer limit without patches , and finally change also the geometrical arrangement of the patches .",
    "the isotropic interaction energy @xmath24 between two different sub - units of types a and b is represented as a simple - square - well like shape ( fig .  [ fig : potentials ] ) @xmath25 & \\mbox{if } r > r_{bead } \\\\   \\infty",

    "the scaling factor @xmath36 is chosen to not over favour the patch contribution over the isotropic one . if its value is too large all sequences form regular structures that depend solely on the symmetries of the patch arrangements on the beads . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is too small all sequences fail to self - assemble and collapse into random glassy three dimensional structures .",
    "a good number was found to be @xmath37 in ref .",
    "the neighbour beads along the chain are bonded via a harmonic spring potential . + in order to find if the system is designable or not , we identify for each configuration of the patches and an alphabet size at least one pattern ( sequence ) that has a global free energy minimum into a given structure .",
    "hence , we have to find such a pattern ( via design mc simulation  @xcite ) and verify if it is capable of folding ( via the folding mc simulation  @xcite ) . in all monte carlo simulations we enhance the sampling with the virtual move parallel tempering algorithm  @xcite , performing each simulation at 16 different temperatures in the set [ 3 , 2.5 , 2.0 , 1.6 , 1.4 , 1.2 , 1.0 , 0.9 , 0.8 , 0.75 , 0.7 , 0.65 , 0.6 , 0.55 , 0.5 , 0.4 ] . to increase the chances to find such a pattern , we first perform a seek mc simulation  @xcite , in order to find potentially designable target structures ( see supplementary figure  [ seek ] ) .",
    "the target structures are represented for each case in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "then we perform the design , where we explore different sequences while keeping the target structure frozen . here",
    "we choose the optimized sequence in the global minimum of the free energy , which corresponds in our method to a low potential energy and a high heterogeneity of the sequence  @xcite .",
    "starting from a fully stretched structure we then perform a folding monte carlo simulation , in order to study the self - assembling properties of this pattern . here",
    "we explore the conformational space keeping the pattern fixed in the designed sequence .",
    "we project the folding free energy onto an order parameter , namely the root mean square displacement of the inter - particle distance ( @xmath21 ) between the target structure and each sampled structure : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distance between the sphere @xmath40 and @xmath41 while @xmath42 is the same distance calculated over the target structure , and @xmath43 is the chain length ( 50 in our case ) .",

    "@xmath22 corresponds uniquely to the target structure .",
    "the closer the global minimum is to @xmath22 , the smaller the corresponding ensemble of structures .",
    "thus , if the free energy landscape has a clear global minimum close to @xmath22 , we can identify at least one pattern that drives the system to fold into a unique target structure : the configuration is designable .",
    "however , not all global minima correspond to folded conformations . indeed , the different cases can be discriminated only by increasing the temperature and pushing the system to unfold .",
    "if the chain at low temperature is folded , then there will be an intermediate temperature at which the system explore conformations with higher values of @xmath21 corresponding to disordered globular structures ( molten globule ) .",
    "the progressive unfolding results in either the appearance of a second minimum ( supplementary figure  [ fig : hight ] ) or the spread of the width of the initial global minimum . on the other hand , for patterns",
    "that do not have a folded state the equilibrium configuration is always a molten globule and the temperature increase does not significantly change the position of the minimum , which corresponds to values of @xmath44 in grey in fig .  [",
    "fig : results ] .",
    "if the system does not reach the folded state , the sdf trials fail , then associated to the tested configuration of the patches there might be only a handful of structures that are designable , if they exists at all .",
    "a heteropolymer with few and hard - to - find designable structures is anyhow not a good candidate for potential applications and is categorized as not - designable . + the radial distribution functions of the patchy polymers in fig .",

    "the normalization has been performed on the same ideal gas with average density , to make the @xmath9 of proteins with different length comparable .",
    "all the @xmath9 have been calculated by neglecting the contribution of the beads ( or amino acids ) directly connected along the chain , in order to ignore their trivial contribution to the first neighbours peak .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to investigate patchy polymers composed by @xmath2 patchy particles decorated with @xmath45 patches , where @xmath46 for freely jointed chains and @xmath47 for freely rotating chains .",
    "the patches are equispaced on the equator and placed on the vertices of a equilateral triangle and a tetrahedron for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 cases , respectively .",
    "for @xmath50 the patches are placed on the surface in the most symmetric way by using the following numerical procedure :    1 .",
    "@xmath45 patches are randomly placed on a sphere , their positions given by the set of vectors @xmath51 2 .",
    "we assign a fictitious energy to the system , defined as @xmath52 3 .",
    "we minimise @xmath53 by attempting to move a randomly chosen patch , accepting the move if the total energy of the system consequently decreases .",
    "formally , this can be regarded as a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation performed at temperature zero .",
    "we iterate this procedure until convergence of @xmath53 .    for completeness , we note that the above method produces a patch distribution which is independent of the definition of distance between two patches , being it the euclidean distance or a spherical distance , for all the values of @xmath45 considered here .",
    "in addition , the patch distribution makes sure that two particles can not be involved in more than one bond ."

    "<S> a minimal set of directional interactions is an effective way to induce such a peak ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr ] ) , and is sufficient to guarantee designability ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] ) .    strictly speaking , proving that a specific heteropolymer configuration is not designable would require testing all possible heterogeneous sequences for the presence of a unique collapsed equilibrium structure . here </S>",
    "<S> we rely on the statistical definition of designability given in  @xcite , where the methodology of the monte carlo simulations seek , design and fold ( sdf ) was proven to be able to discriminate between designable and not - designable structures . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , the sdf method seeks the most designable target structure ( supplementary figure  [ seek ] ) , designs the sequence that should optimally fold into the target structure and then tests whether it correctly folds or not . </S>",
    "<S> if the folding procedure fails , the system is labelled as non - designable , because it was unable to fold into the most favourable target structure ( for details see  methods [ sec : methods ] ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we apply the sdf method to chains made of @xmath2 monomers , with number of patches ranging from 0 to 10 and an alphabet of isotropic interactions of size 3 to 20 ( see  [ sec : methods ] for the definition of the interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , changing the number of patches per monomer makes it possible to move from a simple heteropolymer ( 0 patches ) to a patchy polymer . from now on </S>",
    "<S> , all the distances will be in units of the bead radius @xmath3 and the energies in units of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a reference temperature that sets the scale of interactions .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] we show the results for the designability for all cases studied . </S>",
    "<S> the systems without directional interactions ( patches ) are not designable for any alphabet . by adding directional interactions </S>",
    "<S> , the heteropolymer becomes designable for a wide range of patch numbers and alphabet sizes , both for freely rotating chains and freely jointed chains . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of designability coincides with the appearance of a peak in the pair radial distribution function  highlighted by the grey band in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr]a)located at the distance @xmath6 between the bead centres , at which the patch - patch interaction is most favourable . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such a isolated intermediate peak between the first ( @xmath7 ) and second random close packing neighbours ( @xmath8 ) indicates that the directional interactions are inducing a geometrical frustration in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the frustration strongly biases towards a subset among the compact configurations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the non - designable configurations without patches the directional interaction peak is not present . in the configurations with one patch , </S>",
    "<S> the directional interaction peak is present but is lower than the peak corresponding to the close packing . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations are not always designable ( borderline ) , and their designability depends on the alphabet size ( fig .  [ fig : diagram ] ) . increasing the number of patches </S>",
    "<S> the directional interaction peak becomes dominating over the random packing peak , and hence the configurations become designable for each alphabet . increasing </S>",
    "<S> further the number of patches up to 10 , the system loses directionality as the directional peak splits into more components ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr]a ) and this corresponds to a loss in designability ( fig .  [ fig : diagram ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the strength of the directional interaction is such that even the single patch configuration is always maximally bonded , implying that arbitrarily increasing the relative strength of the directional interactions will not suppress the first peak of the @xmath9 ( supplementary figure  [ seek ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the patch - patch peak dominates over the random close packing peak , the system becomes robustly designable for all alphabet sizes , both for freely jointed and freely rotating chains .    according to the mft of protein design  @xcite , in order to make a system designable , </S>",
    "<S> the alphabet size @xmath10 must be sufficiently large compared to the conformational entropy per particle @xmath11 , or formally : @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the designable  to  not - designable transition , where @xmath13 , allows us to estimate @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , following the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] , we estimate @xmath11 to be @xmath14 for 0 patches , @xmath15 for one patch in the freely rotating chain , and @xmath16 for up to 6 patches . at 10 patches @xmath11 increases again to a value between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . since @xmath19 is connected to the number of compact conformations , the latter is reduced by the patches by approximately an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise evaluation of @xmath11 requires the study of intermediate scenarios and is object of current investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the directional interaction peak is a fundamental fingerprint of designability . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find it to be a general feature also of natural proteins . in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : gr]b we show the radial distribution function for some characteristic examples out of 20 analysed natural proteins . here </S>",
    "<S> , the conformational space is shaped by the directionality of the hydrogen bonds , which forces the carbon c@xmath20 of the amino acids to be at the typical distances for the different types of secondary structure . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the peaks highlighted in grey in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr]b are equivalent to the directional interaction peak observed in the patchy polymers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : protein_scheme ] in the supplementary information for more details ) .        </S>",
    "<S> these results are in agreement with mft  @xcite , which predict that the decrease of conformational freedom allows for better sequence design . here </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the presence of a peak in the @xmath0 not related to the random packing as an estimate of the reduction of the conformational freedom , in order to have a simple tool to anticipate the designability of different polymer architectures . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we propose the presence of such a peak as a general criterion to engineer designable polymer architectures able to fold into unique target structures , with the same accuracy and versatility of natural proteins . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the protein skeleton is a particular choice , and our results suggest that , by following the criterion of the directional interaction peak , several others can be found .    another important result is the characterization of the transition from not - designable to designable configurations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we start by noting that the freely rotating chain is sensitive to the choice of the alphabet : a minimum alphabet size of 7 is required to guarantee designability for any configurations of the patches ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] ) . to characterize the designable  to  not - designable transition , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed for each point in the designability diagram the sdf trial . </S>",
    "<S> the last step of sdf is the calculation of the free energy difference between structures , grouped together according to the distance root mean square displacement ( @xmath21 ) from the target conformation at @xmath22 ( methods [ sec : methods ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the refolding varies considerably for each scenario , and depends on the alphabet size , the number of patches and the local environment of the beads . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] we show the folding free energy profiles for some significant points in the designability diagram for alphabet sizes 3 and 20 ( other alphabets are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : folding_total_results ] in the supplementary information ) . at low temperature ( @xmath23 ) </S>",
    "<S> all curves show a global free energy minimum located at different @xmath21 , however they are considered folded only if the global minimum corresponds to the folded structure and not to a molten globule disordered structure ( for details see  methods [ sec : methods ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> what is striking in the figure is the high refolding accuracy of the freely jointed chain model , with smooth folding profiles and global minima very close to the target structure . </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe such a high accuracy to the stronger constraint experienced by monomers in a freely jointed chain compared to the freely rotating model , in agreement with mft results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the patches in the freely jointed chain have less rotational freedom , thus the conformational entropy @xmath11 is decreased further . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that such high accuracy is particularly interesting for single - patch chains that , according to the designability criterion based on the @xmath9 , is a borderline case ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr]a ) .    in conclusion , we extend the concept of _ designability _ to heteropolymers , bridging the gap between naturally foldable biopolymers and artificial polymers . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that there is a minimal set of ingredients that makes it possible to exert a precise control over the conformation of the folded structure . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we show that , starting from a traditional heteropolymer model ( 0 patches ) , we can attain designability by introducing a few directional interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the patches make the system designable even with alphabet sizes comparable to the case of block - copolymers ( 3 and 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the technology for the synthesis and manipulation of artificial heteropolymers is at an advanced stage , as demonstrated by the numerous materials based on block copolymers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the directional interaction peak in the @xmath0 is a universal fingerprint for designability and thus can be used as a criterion to engineer new heteropolymers . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion will allow artificial heteropolymer to self - assemble into an enormous variety of highly exotic structures with high control over the detailed shape . </S>",
    "<S> this will expand the possibilities of current copolymer technology to the full potential of biopolymers , providing a way of going beyond the current protein- and dna - based materials  @xcite .    </S>",
