    "in lattice qcd simulations the standard algorithm to incorporate effects of dynamical fermions is the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm @xcite which is conventionally used to simulate two - flavor qcd . due to the algorithmic limitation of the hmc ,",
    "those simulations are limited to even numbers of degenerate flavors . in order to include dynamical effects correctly ,",
    "simulations of qcd with three light flavors ( u , d , s quarks ) are desirable .",
    "simulations with an odd number of flavors can be performed using the r - algorithm @xcite . also for two flavors of staggered fermions @xcite , the r - algorithm is chosen because the hmc is not applicable .",
    "the r - algorithm , however , is not exact : it causes systematic errors of order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the step - size of the molecular dynamics evolution .",
    "a careful extrapolation to zero step - size is therefore needed to obtain exact results .",
    "nevertheless , it is common practice to forego this extrapolation and to perform simulations with a single step - size chosen small enough that the expected systematic errors are smaller than the statistical ones . in this paper",
    ", we wish to emphasize that there is an alternative to the r - algorithm , which gives for our problem arbitrarily accurate results ( for infinite computer time ) without any extrapolation to @xmath8@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can make our algorithm exact with an additional , stochastic metropolis test which we describe and implement .",
    "lscher proposed a local algorithm , the so - called `` multiboson algorithm '' @xcite , in which the inverse of the fermion matrix is approximated by a suitable chebyshev polynomial .",
    "originally he proposed it for two - flavor qcd .",
    "borii and de forcrand @xcite noticed that the determinant of a fermion matrix can be written in a manifestly positive way using a polynomial approximation , so that one can simulate odd flavors qcd with the multiboson method .",
    "indeed , using this method , one - flavor qcd was simulated successfully @xcite .",
    "the same polynomial approximation can be applied for the hmc @xcite .",
    "the first example of a polynomial approximation within hmc simulations of two - flavor qcd was made by the authors of @xcite , and later by @xcite .",
    "application to odd flavors qcd is straightforward when one uses borii and de forcrand s idea .",
    "actually , in the development stage of ref.@xcite , one - flavor qcd was also simulated by hmc and it was confirmed that the two algorithmically different methods  multiboson and hmc  give the same distribution of plaquette values @xcite .    in preliminary work@xcite , we have simulated @xmath9 qcd by the hmc with a polynomial approximation , and shown that the results are consistent with those from the r - algorithm . however , the algorithm developed in @xcite is not exact yet",
    ". a polynomial approximation of moderate degree @xmath10 may not be sufficiently accurate , especially for small quark masses .",
    "for such a case , it is important to control the errors coming from the polynomial approximation . in this study , in order to make our algorithm exact , we include the correction factor to the polynomial approximation into the algorithm and compare our results with those from other algorithms ( r - algorithm with one flavor , and two - flavor hmc ) .",
    "a problem specific to odd flavors is the so - called `` sign problem '' : the fermionic determinant may change sign configuration by configuration and one has to include the sign into the statistical average ( when quarks come in equal - mass pairs , the determinant is squared and its sign does not matter ) .",
    "the calculation of the sign of the determinant on each configuration is feasible in principle , but is very costly .",
    "it is common practice to assume that the qcd determinant is always positive .",
    "this is the case in the continuum limit , and there are indications that it is also the case for the lattice spacings normally considered and the quark masses currently reachable  @xcite . anyway , our goal here is not to study the sign problem , but rather to present an alternative method to the r - algorithm , which samples the absolute value of the determinant like the r - algorithm , but requires no extrapolation .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the standard hmc algorithm which is used for even - flavor qcd simulations . in sec .",
    "3 we give our algorithm to simulate odd - flavor qcd , including the additional , stochastic metropolis step which makes the algorithm exact . in sec . 4 - 6",
    "we show results from our algorithm and compare them with other algorithms .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "the lattice qcd partition function with @xmath11 flavors is given by z=(_i^n_f d_i ) ( -s_g[u ] ) , where @xmath12 is the wilson dirac fermion matrix , @xmath13 $ ] with a hopping parameter @xmath14 and @xmath15 $ ] is the lattice wilson hopping operator .",

    "one solves hamilton s equations of motion : & = & + & = & - . in general",
    "these equations are not solvable analytically .",
    "usually one solves the equations approximately by the 2nd order leapfrog integrator which is time - reversible and area - preserving , thanks to which detailed balance is satisfied . after integrating the equations",

    ", one has to treat a single @xmath31 which can not be incorporated into the standard hmc .",
    "borii and de forcrand @xcite noticed that a single @xmath31 , when positive , can be written in a manifestly positive way when lscher s polynomial approximation@xcite is used .",
    "one can approximate the inverse of @xmath32 by a polynomial , 1/dp_m(d ) _ k=1^m(d - z_k ) , [ eq : pn ] where @xmath33 are the roots of the polynomial @xmath34 ( a common choice is @xmath35 ) .",
    "for a polynomial of even degree @xmath36 , the roots come in complex conjugate pairs @xmath37 .",
    "thus , eq.([eq : pn ] ) is rewritten as p_2n(d ) = _ k=1^n(d - z_2k-1)(d-|z_2k-1 ) where @xmath38 . using the @xmath39 hermiticity of the fermion matrix",

    "[ eq : intnf1 ] note that the term @xmath45 is hermitian positive , which can not be realized for one flavor in the standard hmc formulation .",
    "now , the @xmath0 hamiltonian for our hmc algorithm can be defined as h^n_f=1 = p^2 + s_g[u ] + ^t_n^(d)t_n(d ) .",
    "[ eq : nf1-h ] making use of this hamiltonian one can perform hmc simulations for @xmath0 qcd .    the hamiltonian defined by eq.([eq : nf1-h ] ) is an approximation to the exact one , which generates configurations with the measure @xmath46 .",
    "the quality of this approximation is measured by the deviation of @xmath42 ( eq.([cn ] ) ) from one . to make the algorithm exact",
    ", one has to include the correction factor @xmath42 into the algorithm .",
    "there are several possibilities to incorporate @xmath42 in the measure@xcite .",
    "one possibility is to make a global metropolis test with probability p= , [ met ] where @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] correspond to a new candidate configuration @xmath49 and a starting configuration @xmath30 respectively .",
    "since the correction factor is the determinant of a large matrix , its direct calculation is not feasible .",
    "an economical way is to form an unbiased estimator of the ratio @xmath50 and to use a noisy metropolis test@xcite .",
    "the same correction factor appears in the @xmath0 multiboson algorithm@xcite , where the ratio was estimated by rewriting the correction factor using another high - quality polynomial @xmath51 ( @xmath52)@xcite as c_n=_r . using this form of the correction factor , the ratio @xmath50 is written as & & + & = & + & = & < ( -|x^-1x|^2+||^2 ) > _ [ eq : ratio1 ] where @xmath53 .",
    "thus the ratio can be estimated by calculating @xmath54 with only one gaussian random vector @xmath55 . however convergence is slow , and there may be a technical difficulty using a high - quality polynomial : the above estimation includes a number of `` matrix(@xmath32 ) @xmath56 vector + vector '' type calculations , which results in divergence for high - degree polynomials due to the roundoff errors of computers@xcite .",
    "we solve this problem very economically here , by proposing to estimate the ratio @xmath50 from unbiased estimators of @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath57 is easily estimated by ( ) ^2 & = & = ( ) ^2 + & = & + & = & < ( -|w^-1w|^2+||^2 ) > _ [ eq : ratio2 ] where @xmath58 .",
    "then the problem is to estimate @xmath59 using unbiased estimators of @xmath57 only .",
    "this can be accomplished by evaluating stochastically the taylor expansion of @xmath60 as shown in @xcite for @xmath61 .",
    "expanding about @xmath62 , one writes = 1 + 12+_k=2 c_k ( -)^k-1 ^k [ eq : stoch ] where @xmath630,1[$ ] .",
    "first , the left - hand side is assigned value 1 .",
    "next , with probability @xmath64 one computes a stochastic estimator of @xmath65 and adds it to the left - hand side .",
    "then , with probability @xmath66 one computes a second stochastic estimator of @xmath67 and adds @xmath68 to the left - hand side , and so on . in our case , @xmath69 .",
    "when the procedure terminates , one obtains an unbiased estimator of @xmath60 .",
    "there is a difficulty if the estimator becomes negative : it can not be used as a probability in the metropolis test ( eq.([met ] ) ) .",
    "such positivity violations can be reduced by increasing the degree @xmath10 , to the point where they are never observed during the whole simulation .",
    "our algorithm is summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   hmc : we perform molecular dynamics with the approximate hamiltonian eq.([eq : nf1-h ] ) and obtain a candidate configuration @xmath49 .",
    "then we do a metropolis test with acceptance probability @xmath28 . instead of the metropolis one .",
    "this does not seem to be a judicious choice however , since even for an exact md evolution ( @xmath70 ) the acceptance will only be @xmath71 . ]",
    "this removes the step - size integration error .",
    "if the candidate configuration is accepted , we estimate the ratio @xmath50 stochastically by using the method explained above .",
    "we perform another metropolis test with acceptance probability @xmath72 , where @xmath60 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath50 .",
    "this removes the error of the polynomial approximation to @xmath31 .",
    "4 .   if accepted , we take @xmath49 as a new configuration .",
    "otherwise we keep the old configuration .",
    "this algorithm samples the measure @xmath73 , just like the r - algorithm , but does so in a more efficient way which avoids the extrapolation to zero step - size of the latter .",
    "for very small quark masses in the wilson formulation , the dirac determinant may become negative for some background gauge fields .",
    "this happens for a small fraction of the gauge ensemble , which goes to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "therefore , sampling the measure @xmath74 does not affect the continuum limit of the lattice results .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible , if desired , to correct for negative determinants by multiplying the contribution of the corresponding configurations by @xmath75 in the monte carlo ensemble .",
    "this requires identifying possible negative real dirac eigenvalues in the configurations of that ensemble , which can be done e.g. with the arnoldi method .",
    "note that the choice of approximating polynomial is in principle arbitrary : the polynomial approximation error is removed at step 3 above . however , a poor choice of polynomial , e.g. whose domain of approximation does not cover the complete spectrum of the dirac operator , will result in difficulty maintaining positivity of the estimator of @xmath50 , and in longer autocorrelation times .",
