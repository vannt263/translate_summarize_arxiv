    "a mathematical billiard is a system describing the inertial motion of a point mass inside a domain with elastic reflections at the boundary ( which is assumed to have infinite mass ) .",
    "this simple model has been first proposed by birkhoff @xcite as a mathematical playground where : `` _ the formal side , usually so formidable in dynamics , almost completely disappears and only the interesting qualitative questions need to be considered . _ ''    since then billiards have become a very popular subject . not only is their law of motion very physical and intuitive , but billiard - type dynamics is ubiquitous .",
    "mathematically , they offer models in every subclass of dynamical systems ( integrable , regular , chaotic , etc ) .",
    "more importantly , techniques initially devised for billiards have often been applied and adapted to other systems , becoming standard tools and having ripple effects beyond the field .    moreover , despite their apparently simple ( local ) dynamics , their qualitative dynamical properties are extremely non - local ! this global influence on the dynamics translates into several intriguing rigidity phenomena , which are at the basis of many unanswered questions and conjectures .",
    "for instance , while the dependence of the dynamics on the geometry of the domain is well perceptible , an intriguing challenge is to understand to which extent dynamical information can be used to reconstruct the shape of the domain . in this article",
    ", we will address this inverse problem in the case of periodic orbits in a strictly convex smooth planar domain @xmath0 .",
    "+ the study of periodic orbits for billiard maps in strictly convex planar domains has been among the first dynamical features of billiards that have been investigated .",
    "one of the first results in the theory of billiards , for example , can be considered birkhoff s application of poincare s last geometric theorem to show the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits , which can be topologically distinguished in terms of their _ rotation number_,\\ ] ] where the winding number @xmath1 is defined as follows . fix the positive orientation of @xmath2 and pick any reflection point of the closed geodesic on @xmath2 ; then follow the trajectory and count how many times it goes around @xmath2 in the positive direction until it comes back to the starting point .",

    "this result is clearly optimal : in the case of a billiard in an ellipse , for example , there are only two periodic orbits of period @xmath7 ( also called _ diameters _ ) , which correspond to the two semi - axis of the ellipse .",
    "however , it is easy to find cases in which there are more than two periodic orbits for a given rotation number : think , for example , of a billiard in a disk where , due to the existence of a @xmath8-dimensional group of symmetries ( rotations ) , each periodic orbit generates a @xmath8-dimensional family of similar ones ( all diameters are periodic orbits with period @xmath7 ) . +",
    "a natural question is to understand which information on the geometry of the billiard domain , the set of periodic orbits does encode .",
    "more ambitiously , one could wonder whether a complete knowledge of this set allows one to reconstruct the shape of the billiard and hence the whole of the dynamics .",
    "+ let us start by introducing the _ length spectrum _ of a domain @xmath9 .",
    "+    _ given a domain @xmath0 , the length spectrum of @xmath0 is given by the set of lengths of its periodic orbits , counted with multiplicity : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the length of the boundary . _ +    a remarkable relation exists between the length spectrum of a billiard in a convex domain @xmath0 and the spectrum of the laplace operator in @xmath0 with dirichlet boundary condition ( similarly for neumann boundary one ) : @xmath12    from the physical point of view , the eigenvalues @xmath13 are the eigenfrequencies of the membrane @xmath9 with a fixed boundary .    k. andersson and r. melrose @xcite proved the following relation between the laplace spectrum and the length spectrum .",
    "call the function @xmath14 the wave trace . + * theorem ( andersson - melrose ) .",
    "* _ the wave trace @xmath15 is a well - defined generalized function ( distribution ) of @xmath16 , smooth away from the length spectrum , namely , @xmath17 so if @xmath18 belongs to the singular support of this distribution , then there exists either a closed billiard trajectory of length @xmath19 , or a closed geodesic of length @xmath19 in the boundary of the billiard table . _",
    "+    generically , equality holds in . more precisely ,",
    "if no two distinct orbits have the same length and the poincar map of any periodic orbit is non - degenerate , then the singular support of the wave trace coincides with @xmath20 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . +",
    "this theorem implies that , at least for generic domains , one can recover the length spectrum from the laplace one .",
    "this relation between periodic orbits and spectral properties of the domain , immediately recalls a more famous spectral problem ( probably the most famous ) : _ can one hear the shape of a drum ? _ , as formulated in a very suggestive way by mark kac @xcite ( although the problem had been already stated by hermann weyl ) . more precisely :",
    "is it possible to infer information about the shape of a drumhead ( _ i.e. _ , a domain ) from the sound it makes ( _ i.e. _ , the list of basic harmonics/ eigenvalues of the laplace operator with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions ) ?",
    "this question has not been completely solved yet : there are several negative answers ( for instance by milnor @xcite and gordon , webb , and wolpert @xcite ) , as well as some positive ones .",
    "hezari  zelditch , going in the affirmative direction , proved in  @xcite that , given an ellipse @xmath21 , any one - parameter @xmath22-deformation @xmath23 which preserves the laplace spectrum ( with respect to either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions ) and the @xmath24 symmetry group of the ellipse has to be _ flat _ ( _ i.e. _ , all derivatives have to vanish for @xmath25 ) .",
    "topalov @xcite recently extended these results ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "further historical remarks on the inverse spectral problem can be also found in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "sarnak conjectures that the set of smooth convex domains isospectral to a given smooth convex domain is finite ; for a partial progress on this question , see @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in working with the length spectrum is that all of these information come in a non - formatted way .",
    "for example , we lose track of the rotation number corresponding to each length . a way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to `` organize '' this set of information in a more systematic way , for instance by associating to each length the corresponding rotation number .",
    "this new set is called the _ marked length spectrum _ of @xmath0 and denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "+ one could also refine this set of information by considering not the lengths of all orbits , but selecting some of them .",
    "more precisely , for each rotation number @xmath6 in lowest terms , one could consider the maximal length among those having rotation number @xmath6 .",
