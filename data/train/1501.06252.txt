    "pure plutonium is one of the most exotic elemental metals with respect to its condensed matter properties , crystal structure , and metallurgy  @xcite .",
    "it has a phase diagram with six allotropic phases , with the low - temperature monoclinic @xmath1-phase stable up to 395 k , and the technologically important face - center - cubic ( fcc ) @xmath2-phase stable between 592 kelvin and 724 kelvin . while pu metal exhibits a significant atomic - volume expansion , with the @xmath2-phase @xmath3 larger in volume than the @xmath1-phase , no magnetism has been experimentally observed for the @xmath2-phase volume  @xcite .",
    "these unusual physical and mechanical properties  @xcite are believed to be caused by the itinerant - to - localized crossover of 5@xmath0 electronic orbitals  @xcite .",
    "band - structure calculations within the local density approximation ( lda ) fail to predict the equilibrium volume of the nonmagnetic @xmath2-phase of pu  @xcite ; while the lda+@xmath4 calculations gives the experimental @xmath2-phase volume with an appropriate value of @xmath4 but also indicates an instability toward an antiferromagnetic ground state  @xcite .",
    "later lda+@xmath4 calculations  @xcite that included spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) suggested that the magnetism could be naturally quenched and that the correct @xmath2-phase volume could be obtained if the pu atom is in a closed - shell pu 5@xmath5 configuration , .",
    "however , the lda+@xmath4 method is unable to obtain the major 5@xmath0-character quasiparticle peak near the fermi energy as observed by photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) on @xmath2-pu  @xcite .",
    "recently , the lda+dmft method  @xcite , which is a combination of lda with the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite needed to capture important quantum dynamical fluctuation effects , has become a powerful tool to address the strongly correlated electronic materials .",
    "when applied to the @xmath2-phase of pu , the lda+dmft method can explain not only the large volume expansion  @xcite but can also address the absence of magnetism  @xcite and the quasiparticle peak near the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "the same approach has also recently demonstrated site - selective electronic correlation effects in the @xmath1-phase of pu  @xcite .",
    "the key to this success lies in the fact that the dmft generates both the incoherent as well as the coherent parts of the spectral density in the intermediate coupling regime , with the former responsible for atomic - like behavior while the latter for the quenching of magnetism through kondo screening  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , pes has played a significant role in uncovering the correlated - electron phenomena in @xmath0-electron materials , including elemental pu solids .",
    "this probe measures the occupied part ( that is , that below the fermi energy ) of the spectral density .",
    "however , to understand the precise nature of the quasiparticle bands in @xmath2-pu and other pu - based materials , it would be important to map out the quasiparticle states in the unoccupied regions as well . scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )",
    "has proved to be another important experimental technique for understanding emergent phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems such as , for example , high - temperature superconductors  @xcite .",
    "this probe measures the local tunneling conductance at the atomic scale .",
    "one of the earlier successes of this powerful technique was the imaging of the kondo resonance state for magnetic adaptors ( like co ) on metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "recently , this technique has also been successfully extended to 4@xmath0-based heavy fermion systems  @xcite and uru@xmath6si@xmath6  @xcite , opening up new avenues of approach towards an understanding of @xmath7-electron properties in pu .",
    "no doubt , a clear - cut stm observation of kondo resonance around a pu impurity in a nonmagnetic host would provide direct evidence for a correlation - driven entanglement of the pu 5@xmath0-electrons with noninteracting conduction electrons in a metallic environment .    while much theoretical work has been done on the electronic correlation effects of the solid phases of pu",
    ", the kondo physics of a single pu atom that is either embedded substitutionally in the bulk or adsorbed on the surface of a thorium ( th ) host is actually very important as a foundational study for pu correlation physics , since such a study provides a benchmark for the electronic properties of an isolated pu impurity in an otherwise non - interacting bath .",
    "in addition , an impurity - like physics plays a critical role within the dmft methodology , which makes a study of an isolated pu impurity atom even more valuable . with this in mind , in this article we present calculations of the local electronic structure of pu impurities in both the bulk and absorbed on the surface .",
    "this quantum many - body problem is treated by a combination of the local - density approximation with a continuous - time quantum monte carlo method . by considering the competition between the hybridization of the 5@xmath0 electrons with the delocalized conduction electrons and the local coulomb repulsion within the pu-5@xmath0 electron manifold",
    ", kondo resonances are found in the local pu-5@xmath0 spectral density . by comparing the width of the resonance peak between the geometries",
    ", we find the kondo temperature is higher for pu atoms substitutionally embedded in the th bulk than for those adsorbed on the surface of the th host .",
    "also , due to the strong spin - orbit coupling in the system , the resonance occurs in the @xmath8 manifold .    from the perspective of electronic and magnetic properties ,",
    "the pu impurity problem is especially important because of its flexibility to address the electron localization / delocalization of pu @xmath7 electrons .",
    "in addition , such an understanding will not only serve as a test of sophisticated theoretical capabilities but will also stimulate local - probe experiments like stm to contribute insights into emergent phenomena in pu - based materials .",
    "a realistic description of the electronic properties of a pu atom embedded in the bulk or adsorbed on the ( 001 ) surface of a th host , with the geometry shown in fig .",

    "the quantity @xmath16 is the energy dispersion for the th bath , where the label @xmath13 includes crystal momentum , band index , and spin , @xmath17 is the on - site single - particle energy levels , where @xmath1 denotes both the orbital and spin quantum numbers , @xmath18 are the coulomb matrix elements , and @xmath19 is the strength of hybridization between the local degrees of freedom and the continuum .    except for the local coulomb interaction , our density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations for the anderson impurity model hamiltonian ( see just above ) were done in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite using the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method of the wien2k code  @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling was included in a second variational step , with relativistic @xmath20 local orbitals added to the basis set for the 6@xmath21 states  @xcite of plutonium and thorium .",
    "the muffin - tin radius was set to 3.3@xmath22 for pu in the th bulk and 2.5@xmath22 for pu on the th surface , while 2.5@xmath22 was used for all th atoms in both cases . here",
    "@xmath22 is the bohr radius .",
    "the @xmath23 number of @xmath24-points was used for the calculations of pu in the th bulk while @xmath25 for the calculations of pu on the th surface .",
    "we constructed the supercell by starting with a @xmath26 number of fcc - th conventional cells with the experimentally determined lattice constant @xmath27  @xcite . for the pu on the th bulk",
    ", pu was substituted for one th ( see the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : struct ] ) while for the pu on the th surface , pu was optimized along the @xmath28 direction toward the center of a th surface plaquette ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) .",
    "the optimal distance of pu away from the th surface is @xmath29 in a vacuum of a @xmath30 perpendicular distance between two neighboring th slabs .",
    "we note that , because the calculation of systems with a large number of actinide atoms is computationally demanding in the fp - lapw method , a full - structure relaxation procedure is not explored .",
    "furthermore , since the atomic number of th is close to that of pu , we expect that a full - structure relaxation will not qualitatively change the kondo physics discussed in the present work .    to include in the dft an explicit of coulomb interaction between pu @xmath7-electrons requires a clear definition of the atomic - like local orbitals . in the present work ,",
    "we use the weight - conserved projection procedure  @xcite to extract the local green s function for the correlated pu @xmath7-orbitals from the full green s function defined in the dft basis .",
    "since only the 5@xmath0 electrons of the pu impurity site have an onsite coulomb interaction , we can integrate out the non - interaction bath degrees of freedom from the th media and arrive at an effective action @xmath31\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the fermion operators in the hamiltonian become grassman variables in the action , and @xmath32 is the inverse of the temperature @xmath33 .",
    "the non - interacting impurity green s function is @xmath34 with a hybridization function @xmath35 where we use a matsubara frequency formalism , with @xmath36 for fermions .",
    "a strong - coupling version of the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) method  @xcite , which provides numerically exact solutions , was used to solve this multiple - orbital anderson impurity problem .",
    "although the coulomb interaction parameters can also be determined by dft calculations , we used a value of @xmath37 ev , which is consistent with previous work on elemental pu  @xcite .",
    "the remaining slater integrals , @xmath38 ev , @xmath39 ev , and @xmath40 ev , were calculated using cowan s atomic - structure code  @xcite , but reduced by 30% to account for screening . since the dft already includes the hartree - term of the coulomb interaction , a double - counting correction @xmath41 with a nominal value of @xmath42 for pu-@xmath7 electrons",
    "@xcite has been used in the single - particle @xmath0-level .",
    "for very - well defined local pu-@xmath7 orbitals , this double - counting scheme has the virtue of numerical stability  @xcite .",
    "the pu-@xmath7 spectral density from the ct - qmc simulations is extracted using the maximal entropy method  @xcite .",
    "a similar procedure has been used to study the problem of a transition - metal magnetic atom co in cu hosts  @xcite , where the formation of a kondo - resonance fermi liquid is uncovered . in that kind of systems , since the spin - orbit coupling is negligible , the cubic harmonics are a good basis to express the self - energy and local green s function of correlated co-@xmath43 orbitals . in the present work , due to the strong spin - orbit coupling of actinide atoms ,",
    "we choose the relativistic harmonics @xmath44 basis to express the self - energy and local green s function of correlated pu-@xmath7 orbitals .",
    "this choice minimizes the off - diagonal elements of the self - energy and local green s function , which reduces the minus - sign problem in qmc impurity simulations .     projected density of states ( dos ) of the pu impurity as well as the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath7 projected dos of the th sites nearest - neighboring to the pu impurity for the cases ( a ) of pu in bulk th and ( b ) of pu on the th surface .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : ldados ] , we show the projected density of states ( dos ) on the pu impurity and that on th nearest - neighbor sites around the impurity , obtained from dft - gga calculations . for the pu atom in bulk",
    "th , the strong spin - orbit coupling of pu causes the @xmath7 states to be split into two manifolds , corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath47 of the total angular - momentum quantum number .",
    "these states are located around the fermi energy in the range from about -1 ev to 0.5 ev for the @xmath8 states and from about 0.5 ev to 1.5 ev for the @xmath47 states .",
    "the th-@xmath7 partial dos also exhibits soc - split peak structure , but about 2 ev above the fermi energy , suggesting that the th-@xmath7 states are not occupied .",
    "the th-@xmath46 and th-@xmath45 dos show wide - band behavior , while the th-@xmath46 contributes dominantly to the bath dos around the fermi energy , which hybridizes most strongly with the pu-@xmath7 impurity electronic states . for the pu impurity on the th surface ,",
    "qualitatively similar features are exhibited in the dos .",
    "noticeably , the pu-@xmath7 dos shows a narrower quasiparticle peak width with the dominant spectral weight distributed in the range of about -0.6 ev to 0.1 ev for the @xmath8 states and 0.5 ev to 1.2 ev for the @xmath47 states .",
    "this difference is closely related to the unique structure of each geometry .",
    "for substitutional pu in bulk th , the pu atom has 12 nearest - neighbor th sites , with a pu - th distance of @xmath48 ; while for pu atoms on the th surface , there are only 4 bonds to the nearest th atoms , with a bond distance of about @xmath49 .",
    "states and the th bath calculated within the gga approximation for ( a ) pu in bulk th and ( b ) for pu on the th surface .",
    "the vertical dashed line in the figure denotes the fermi energy . ]",
    "to further clarify the close relation between the electronic structure and the local atomic environment for each geometry , we evaluate the frequency - dependent hybridization function , @xmath50/\\pi$ ] , where @xmath51 is the hybridization self - energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybrid ] ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldahybrid ] the hybridization function obtained from the gga calculations . for the pu impurity in bulk th , the hybridization function strength is about 0.8 ev when averaged over the frequency range between -0.3 ev and 0.7 ev . for the pu atom on the th surface ,",
    "the strength is about 0.5 ev when averaged over the frequency range between -1 ev and 1 ev . in addition , the overall hybridization function strength for both the @xmath8 and the @xmath47 manifolds is similar , with that for @xmath47 being only slightly larger for a given geometry .",
    "we ascribe this slight difference to the fact that the pu-@xmath7 level for the @xmath47 states , @xmath52 , is closer to the center of gravity of the th-@xmath46 band .        by switching on the coulomb interaction on the pu impurity ,",
    "the ct - qmc simulations indicate a significant electronic correlation on the pu impurity . for the pu atom in bulk",
    "th , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmftdos_1](a ) , the total dos ( red line ) obtained from the ct - qmc simulations at @xmath53 kelvin show not only a quasiparticle peak very close to the fermi energy but also incoherent peaks at higher energies . from the plot of the @xmath54-resolved dos , one can see clearly that the @xmath8 channel ( blue line ) is the dominant contribution to the quasiparticle peak with only minor intensity from the @xmath47 channel at the same energy position ( green line ) , while the incoherent peak located above the fermi energy appears mainly in the @xmath47 channel ( green line ) .",
    "the quasiparticle peak obtained from the ct - qmc simulations is also more than a factor of 2 narrower than the peak on the @xmath8 partial dos obtained from gga calculations , suggesting a many - body interaction - driven kondo resonance state .",
    "for the pu atom on the th surface , which has a reduced hybridization , the quasiparticle peak becomes much narrower , as shown by the red and blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmftdos_1](b ) , especially when compared with the case of a substitutional pu atom in bulk th .",
    "in addition , the incoherent peak below the fermi energy also becomes visible in the @xmath8 channel .",
    "therefore , our results indicate that the kondo resonance state develops in the @xmath8 channel .",
    "physically , it results from almost all of the occupied pu-@xmath7 electrons residing in the @xmath8 subshell . when comparing the results from gga calculations ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ldados ] ) and from the low - temperature ct - qmc simulations ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : dmftdos_1 ] ) , the degree of interaction - driven quasiparticle renormalization between the two geometries is similar . to quantify the quasiparticle renormalization",
    ", we estimate the quasiparticle spectral weight defined as @xmath55}^{-1}\\;,\\ ] ] where the small contribution from the hybridization at the fermi energy has been neglected . because the quasiparticle peak occurs in the @xmath8 subshell",
    ", we consider only the correlation - driven self - energy in this channel , which leads to @xmath56 for the pu in bulk th while @xmath57 for the pu on the th surface . when the numerical uncertainty is taken into account , the above observation is well supported .     except at the temperature t = 725 kelvin . ]    within the ct - qmc simulations , the kondo temperature that is defined from a renormalized fermi - liquid theory for the anderson impurity model  @xcite that is given by @xmath58 can also be determined .",
    "it was found that @xmath59 kelvin for the pu in bulk th and @xmath60 kelvin for the pu on the th surface .",
    "this energy scale should be scaled with the width of the kondo resonance peak developed near the fermi energy , which can be measured by stm experiments . to demonstrate the temperature effect",
    ", we also performed ct - qmc simulations at a higher temperature ( @xmath61 kelvin ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmftdos_2 ] , the pu-@xmath7 spectral density for the case of the pu in bulk th is not much different than that at low temperature while the quasiparticle peak for the case of the pu on the th surface is strongly suppressed in intensity .",
    "interestingly , at this temperature , which is already higher than the kondo temperature for the pu on the th surface , the low - energy dos peak is still quite visible .",
    "one possibility is that the kondo temperature is systematically underestimated .",
    "the other possibility is that the low - energy dos peak may contain the contribution from both the kondo - driven many - body physics and the multiplet effect usually occurring in the atomic physics .",
    "our ct - qmc simulations yield a pu-@xmath7 occupancy of @xmath62 for the pu in bulk th and 5.35 for the pu on the th surface . these values suggest that the pu-@xmath7 electronic states are in the mixed - valence regime . the pu-@xmath7 mixed - valence behavior together with the multiplet effects have also been proposed in the elemental pu solid  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this resemblance leads one to believe that the second possibility is more likely .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to mention that we also performed the ct - qmc simulations for the case of a pu impurity substituted for a th atom in the surface of the th slab . in this geometry",
    ", the pu impurity has 8 nearest - neighboring sites with the pu - th distance of @xmath48 .",
    "we obtained results ( not shown here ) similar to the case of the pu on the th surface .",
    "we have performed a first - principles study of the kondo physics of a pu impurity in a th host within the framework of dft theory in combination with the ct - qmc simulations . by considering two representative geometries of either a substitutional pu impurity embedded in bulk th bulk or adsorbed on the th surface",
    ", we have been able to identified the kondo resonance states developing near the fermi energy . for a fixed set of on - site coulomb - interaction parameters ,",
    "the width of the quasiparticle dos peak has been shown to be sensitive to the strength of the low - energy hybridization of pu-@xmath7 electrons with the conduction band in the th medium , as borne out by the two geometries considered here . by varying the temperature ,",
    "we have also discussed the nature of the quasiparticle peak in the context of the estimated kondo temperature scale . with the recent success of stm for exploring emergent phenomena in @xmath0-electron materials ,",
    "we hope that the results presented in this work will stimulate stm exploration for pu - based @xmath0-electron materials .",
