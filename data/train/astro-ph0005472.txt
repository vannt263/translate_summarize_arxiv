    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) were separated from classical gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) based on the repetition of transient events from a single source and their soft spectra @xcite , which are generally well - fit by an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model @xcite .",
    "the events tend to be short ( @xmath3 ) , but on occasion have been observed for hundreds of seconds ( e.g. the march 5 , 1979 @xcite and august 27 , 1998 giant flares @xcite ) .",
    "the positions of sgrs are all near or in supernova remnants @xcite and all have quiescent x - ray counterparts @xcite .",
    "the quiescent x - ray counterparts to sgr  1900 + 14 @xcite , sgr  1806 - 20 @xcite and possibly sgr  1627 - 41 ( @xcite but see also @xcite ) are x - ray pulsars with several second periods .",
    "furthermore , these pulsars show spindown periods which imply dipole magnetic fields of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this evidence strongly suggests that the sources of sgr events are highly magnetized , young neutron stars ( magnetars ) @xcite in which magnetically induced starquakes result in the sudden release of @xmath5-rays @xcite .",
    "there is currently nothing known about the spectrum of soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) bursts at energies below a few kev . in this paper",
    "we present optical observations of sgr locations contemporaneous with sgr @xmath5-ray events .",
    "the robotic optical transient search experiment ( rotse ) @xcite is configured to respond to transient events from the gamma - ray burst coordinates network ( gcn ) @xcite and is capable of rapidly slewing to the coordinates of a transient event such as an sgr burst .",
    "since beginning operations in march 1998 , the first generation system , rotse - i , has triggered on 16 sgr events .",
    "for all of these events , gcn alerts were based on data from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) @xcite .",
    "a typical rotse - i response to a batse - derived gcn trigger consists of a series of _ direct _ exposures centered at the trigger coordinates followed by a series of _ tiled _ exposures with the mount shifted by @xmath6 ( half the total field of view ( fov ) ) in both right ascension and declination to extend rotse - i s coverage of the gcn error box . the duration of the exposures and the number of times the _ direct_/_tile _ sequence is repeated depends on the type of trigger received from gcn and its typical delay from the onset of the trigger event .",
    "currently , rotse - i makes no distinction in its response to grbs and sgrs .",
    "most gcn triggers arrive @xmath7 after the start of a burst , while some are delayed 5 - 11 minutes .",
    "rotse - i generally begins observations @xmath8 after receiving a gcn trigger . for observations begun within a few minutes of a burst ,",
    "image exposure lengths start at 5 s and are extended first to 25 s and then to 125 s. in 1999 we reduced the latter two exposure lengths to 20 s and 80 s , respectively .",
    "rotse - i has responded to 16 sgr triggers . of these",
    ", useful data were obtained for 8 sgr  1900 + 14 bursts and for 2 sgr  1806 - 20 bursts .",
    "sample corrected images for both sources are shown in figure  [ fig : sgrs ] .",
    "for most of these events , the first useful images are delayed by over 2 minutes , either because the sgr position is only in tiled images or because a disproportionate number of sgr triggers were of the delayed types .",
    "the exception is batse trigger 6809 , for which we have images starting @xmath9 after the burst and continuing for one hour .",
    "the durations of the sgr bursts were all @xmath10 with the exception of batse trigger 6798 which was a series of bursts emitted over a period of 350 s. in the response to this trigger , two rotse images follow emission spikes by @xmath8 ( see figure  [ fig:6798lc ] ) . rotse - i sgr responses are summarized in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "all images have been dark - corrected and flat - fielded .",
    "all objects in an image are detected using sextractor @xcite .",
    "the object lists are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated against the tycho reference catalogue @xcite .",
    "since rotse - i uses an unfiltered ccd , the photometry is color - corrected using tycho @xmath11 to produce a rotse - i equivalent v - band magnitude , @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure produces photometric errors as small as @xmath13 for stars with @xmath14 .",
    "the astrometric errors are typically @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .        currently available localizations for sgrs are a small fraction of the @xmath17 rotse - i field of view so that only a small portion of any image must be searched for new or variable objects .",
    "the adopted search regions for sgr  1900 + 14 and sgr  1806 - 20 are centered on @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . in both cases",
    "we use a @xmath20 ( 10 pixel ) radius search region . for sgr  1900 + 14",
    "the search region is @xmath21 times larger than the statistical ipn error region @xcite and @xmath22 times larger than the vla error region @xcite . for sgr  1806 - 20",
    "the search region is @xmath23 times larger than the ipn error ellipse @xcite .",
    "the error regions are enlarged so that artificially added objects used to determine our efficiency ( see below ) do not always fall on the same pixels .",
    "no new or variable objects were detected in any images within the specified search regions .",
    "limits , shown in figure  [ fig : limits ] , were obtained by determining at what magnitude our efficiency for detecting artificially added objects falls to 50% . for sgr1806 - 20 , we found these added objects with sextractor . for sgr1900 + 14 , we searched by eye for the added objects in all images and used sextractor for a subset of the images ; a comparison between the methods indicates that agreement is within @xmath24 .",
    "the limits are calculated in this manner to avoid two potential problems .",
    "first , the rotse - i plate scale is @xmath25 so that distinct catalog sources may blend into a single object in a rotse - i image .",
    "second , @xmath12 only corresponds to @xmath26 on average , limiting the usefulness of single object catalog comparisons .      since both sgr  1900 + 14 and sgr  1806 - 20 are at low galactic latitudes , extinction is a large concern .",
    "unfortunately , no direct measurements of the extinction to either sgr exist .",
    "however , infrared observations covering the ipn localization for sgr  1900 + 14 provide estimates of @xmath27 at @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 @xcite . to get an alternate estimate for the extinction to these sgrs",
    ", we turn to the x - ray data .",
    "both sgr  1900 + 14 and sgr  1806 - 20 have been detected as x - ray pulsars so that the hydrogen column density measured from the x - ray spectra can be used to estimate optical extinction via the relation @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the stated error is entirely statistical while the dominant errors are likely to be systematic .",
    "furthermore , this relation ignores the possible lack of correlation between x - ray absorption and optical extinction near the sgr itself .",
    "for example , if self - absorption of x - rays at the source is important , this relation will over - estimate the optical extinction ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "conversely , dust local to the sgr would necessitate increasing the optical extinction calculated by scaling to @xmath32 . nevertheless , this relation will provide us with useful estimates of the optical extinction .",
    "sgr  1900 + 14 was detected as a pulsar by asca and spectral fits gave a hydrogen column density of @xmath33 and an estimated distance to the sgr of @xmath34 @xcite which agrees with the distance estimate to the supernova remnant g42.8 + 0.6 with which the sgr appears to be associated @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath35 and the equivalent extinctions in r and i band of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see e.g. @xcite ) respectively .    for sgr  1806 - 20",
    ", @xmath38 @xcite gives @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "given the enormous extinction to sgr  1806 - 20 , we will restrict the remainder of the discussion to sgr  1900 + 14 .    as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : data_reduction ] , the rotse - i system does not use a standard passband so that an estimate of the system s spectral response was required to understand the appropriate extinction value to adopt . in figure",
    "[ fig : response]a , the quantum efficiency of the thomson ccd is shown along with measurements of the transmission of the canon telephoto lens . the lens transmission above @xmath42 was measured using a ti - sapphire laser and errors were estimated at a few percent .",
    "the lens transmission below @xmath42 was measured with hene and grene lasers with errors less than 1 percent .",
    "the dashed curve in the figure is a linear least - squares fit to the ti - sapphire data matched to a line through the hene and grene points .",
    "this simple parameterization is sufficient to investigate the effects of extinction on the spectral response of the system . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : response ] , the ccd quantum efficiency multiplied by the model of the lens transmission is shown along with this same curve additionally multiplied by an extinction curve with @xmath43 .",
    "there are three points to be noted about the rotse - i spectral response .",
    "first , although we quote an equivalent v - band magnitude , @xmath12 , the rotse - i system is best color - matched to r - band .",
    "second , in the absence of extinction , the response is dominated by the ccd quantum efficiency which extends to @xmath44 .",
    "finally , when the extinction is included , the spectral response is more closely matched to a narrow i - band filter .",
    "given these complications , we will conservatively adopt @xmath36 applied directly to our values of @xmath12 for the remainder of this paper .      with the calculated extinction to sgr  1900 + 14",
    ", we can now address how bright an optical transient would have to be for rotse - i to detect it .",
    "accepting the distance of @xmath45 for sgr  1900 + 14 , a typical rotse - i limit of @xmath46 gives an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath47 .",
    "the extinction of @xmath48 increases this limit to @xmath49 , about the brightness of a nova .    in the absence of firm predictions for the expected optical emission from sgrs following soft @xmath5-ray events",
    ", we can only investigate constraints on possible sites for emission .",
    "there are two constraints with which we will be concerned , the rotse-1 magnitude limits expressed as a luminosity and the brightness temperature limits they imply assuming various emission regions .",
    "we will consider three possible sites for optical emission : the magnetar surface , a region comparable in size to the light cylinder ( i.e. the radius at which field lines co - rotating with the neutron star would travel at the speed of light ) and a nebula .",
    "for what follows , we compute the luminosity limit implied by @xmath50 .",
    "the spectral energy density , scaled to an extinction of @xmath51 , is @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to a limit on the isotropic optical luminosity of @xmath53    first , we investigate emission from near the magnetar surface .",
    "sgr events with rise and decay times unresolved with @xmath54 time bins imply a source for the @xmath5-rays @xmath55 in extent @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this emission arises near the magnetar surface times larger in area than the neutron star ( r. duncan 2000 , private communication ) , which does not change the conclusion reached here . ] .",
    "sgr events are super - eddington in the x - ray ( @xmath56 ) so that there is certainly sufficient energy released in the system to produce a luminosity @xmath57 comparable to that in equation  [ eq : opt_lum_lim ] .",
    "however , computing the brightness temperature via @xmath58 justifies the rayleigh - jeans form for blackbody emission . ] with @xmath59 the solid angle subtended by the source , gives : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the distance to the sgr is units of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is its radius in units of @xmath64 .",
    "this should be compared with a typical temperature of @xmath65 obtained in spectral fits to burst data or @xmath66 for the neutron star surface .",
    "therefore , the rotse - i limits do not constrain the optical emission from near the magnetar surface .",
    "next we consider optical emission from a region comparable in size to the magnetar s light cylinder , @xmath67 . here",
    "the rotse-1 limits imply @xmath68 . at this distance ,",
    "the magnetar s dipolar field strength , @xmath69 , gives an upper limit of @xmath70 to any radiation derived from magnetic field energy .",
    "the optical limits presented here are considerably lower than this , but we lack a plausible mechanism for producing optical emission at this distance scale .    finally , we consider emission from a nebula energized by the sgr activity .",
    "seven days after the giant flare of august 27 , 1998 , @xcite derive a lower limit on the size of the radio nebula around sgr  1900 + 14 of @xmath71 .",
    "this can only be used as a rough estimate of the size relevant to the rotse-1 observations since it is a lower limit and it is derived at late times for a nebula which is presumed to be expanding .",
    "the implied limit on optical brightness temperature at the scale of @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "this is well below the limit of @xmath74 for incoherent synchrotron emission .",
    "the only issue then is whether or not detectable luminosity could be generated in a nebula surrounding the sgr .    to estimate nebular optical luminosity",
    ", we closely follow @xcite using his scalings except where noted . during a super - eddington sgr burst",
    ", a relativistic fireball is expected which will sweep up material in the medium surrounding the sgr , producing a shock which will dissipate energy via synchrotron radiation . scaling to a @xmath5-ray energy of @xmath75 ,",
    "the total energy of the burst is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the efficiency of conversion of total burst energy into soft @xmath5-rays and @xmath78 is the soft @xmath5-ray energy scaled to @xmath79 .",
    "the electron - positron pairs in the fireball will be energized by the shock and will radiate with a half - power lifetime of @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the magnetic field and @xmath82 the lorentz factor of @xmath83 pairs accelerated in the shock .",
    "we use @xmath84 as estimated from the vla angular size lower limit @xcite and @xmath85 as in @xcite . to obtain the conversion efficiency , @xmath86 , from total burst energy to high energy nebular emission @xcite scales using the high energy efficiency of the crab nebula , @xmath87 , whereas for optical emission @xmath88 is a more appropriate estimate ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we note that this is still likely to be an over - estimate of the optical efficiency since the electron density of the optical emitting regions in the crab nebula is @xmath89 ( see e.g. @xcite ) while sgr  1900 + 14 is found outside snr g42.8 + 0.6 @xcite where one might expect densities @xmath90 @xcite .    with the preceding relations",
    ", we can parameterize the expected optical luminosity from nebular emission as : @xmath91 the luminosity limit in equation  [ eq : opt_lum_lim ] is roughly two orders of magnitude greater than that estimated for nebular emission in equation  [ eq : model_lum ] and is therefore not particularly constraining . however , this type of emission is the most likely target for future observations of the type discussed in this paper .",
    "@xcite used a high speed photoelectric photometer attached to a @xmath92 telescope to monitor the position of sgr  0526 - 66 for 910 hours .",
    "three optical bursts were detected , but no @xmath5-ray events were detected in coincidence with these events .",
    "furthermore , there was insufficient information on backgrounds to unambiguously identify the optical flashes with sgr  0526 - 66 .",
    "the 3 events peaked around @xmath93 for a few milliseconds .",
    "assuming that sgr  0526 - 66 is at a distance of @xmath94 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and correcting for a reddening of @xmath95 @xcite , this corresponds to @xmath96 at the peak .",
    "unfortunately , the shortest rotse-1 exposures of @xmath97 reach a limit @xmath98 averaged over the exposure length .",
    "therefore , the luminosity limit in equation  [ eq : opt_lum_lim ] for sgr  1900 + 14 is a factor of @xmath99 too large to detect flashes similar to those observed by @xcite .      with the large extinction in the direction of the known sgrs ,",
    "a campaign specifically designed to detect sgrs would utilize a rapid - response detector sensitive in the @xmath100 region of the spectrum .",
    "however , rotse - i will continue to observe sgr triggers since doing so is a simple extension of rotse s main grb response program .",
    "furthermore , the rotse collaboration is developing several @xmath101 aperture telescopes which should be @xmath102 more sensitive than rotse - i and may be sensitive enough to detect optical emission from sgr  1900 + 14 at the level @xcite reported for sgr  0526 - 66 or the nebular emission discussed in section  [ sec : interpretation ] .",
    "we have presented the first limits on optical emission immediately following sgr bursts for 10 events .",
    "limits on optical transient counterparts are in the range @xmath103 during the period @xmath104 to @xmath2 after the bursts . for the 8 events from sgr  1900 + 14 , these limits correspond to extinction - corrected absolute magnitudes of @xmath105",
    ". a more sensitive rotse telescope currently being developed may be sufficiently sensitive to detect optical emission from a flaring nebula surrounding sgr  1900 + 14 or emission similar to that possibly seen for sgr  0526 - 66 .",
