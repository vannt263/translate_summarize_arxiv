    "the giant radio galaxy messier 87 ( m87 ) , also known as 3c 274 or virgo a , is one of the best studied radio sources and a known @xmath2-ray - emitting agn .",

    "however this motion was measured in regions on a larger scale with respect to the vlbi structures discussed here . in this time range hst-1 in the radio band was a faint jet structure ( a few mjy / beam , see fig.[fig1 ] ) , but starting from 2000 it increased by more than a factor 50 and it reached a flux density @xmath1 100 mjy in 2005 ( see fig.[fig2 ] and ( * ? ? ?",

    "vlbi observations of the m87 inner region show a well resolved , edge - brightened jet structure . at very high resolution",

    "the inner jet region was favoured by the observed short tev variability timescales according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aharonian et al . 2006 ) . the vhe emission",

    "* neronov et al . 2007 ) ) or in the slower jet layer ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tavecchio et al . 2008 ) ) , with the spine accounting for the emission from the radio to the gev band ; this would lead to a complex correlation between the tev and radio components .",
    "however , vlba observations at 1.7 ghz by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cheung et al . 2007 ) resolved hst-1 in substructures with superluminal components .",
    "* aharonian et al . 2006 ) discussed that hst-1 can not be excluded as a source of tev @xmath2 rays , however they conclude that the more promising possibility is that the site of tev @xmath2-ray production is the nucleus of m87 itself . comparing multifrequency data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* harris et al . 2008 ) suggested that the tev emission from m87 was originated in hst-1 .",
    "finally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* acciari et al . 2009 ) reported rapid tev flares from m87 in february 2008 , associated by an in increase of the radio flux from the nucleus , while hst-1 was in a low state , thus concluding that the tev flares originate in the core region .",
    "in this context we started at the end of 2009 a program to observe with the e - evn m87 at 5 ghz to study the properties of the m87 core , jet , and hst-1 structure .",

    "* acciari et al . 2009 ) assumed as a likely range @xmath9 = 15  25 deg .",
    "because of the very similar uv - coverage , we used our images to search for evidence of a possible proper motion , comparing different epoch position of jet substructures and subtracting images at different epochs ( with the same grid , angular resolution and similar uv - coverage ) to look for possible systematic trends .",
    "no evidence was found in anycase .",
    "we find a marginal evidence of a nuclear flux density increasing in the last three epochs . in these epochs",
    "we have an increase of the core flux density and of the inner jet ( within @xmath1 8 mas ) flux density .",

    "the hst-1 size is in agreement with a very small ( @xmath1 0@xmath10 ) jet opening angle confirming the high jet collimation in the sub - arcsecond region .    to better study the dynamic of this structure we searched archive vla data at high resolution ( a configuration ) and high frequency ( u , and q bands ) .",

    "a clear change in the proper motion velocity is present at the epoch @xmath1 2005.5 , coincident with the tev @xmath2-ray activity and the maximum radio / x - ray flux density of hst-1 . in the time range 2003  2005.5",
    "the apparent velocity is 0.5c  0.6c ; in the time range 2005.5  2010.25 the apparent velocity is @xmath1 2.7c .",
    "we note also a possible decrease in the apparent velocity in 2007 with a restarted high velocity motion from 2008 ( near the time of the high energy flare ) up to now . assuming a jet orientation angle = 25@xmath10 a proper motion of 2.7c corresponds to an intrinsic velocity = 0.94c .",
    "with our new e - evn data we have obtained images of the nuclear region of m87 and of the jet substructure hst-1 .",
    "the hst-1 structure is well resolved in many substructures .",
    "a complex proper motion is clearly present . comparing e - evn data with archive vla data and published vlba data at 1.7 and 15 ghz we find a strong evidence that in 2005.5 hst-1 increased its velocity from an apparent velocity @xmath1 0.5c to 2.7c . with present data it is not possible to discuss if this change in velocity is related to the m87 vhe activity and/or to the maximum radio / x - ray flux density of hst-1 at this epoch .",
    "a more regular and longer monitor and a multi - frequency comparison is necessary to clarify this point ."
