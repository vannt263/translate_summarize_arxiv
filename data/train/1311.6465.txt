    "of course , further cuts will be required to separate the signal from the background , but we leave that to a separate study .",
    "isr and beamstrahlung , on the other hand , do modify these distributions .",
    "the modification is similar to that of the finite widths , but more extreme showing that the effect of finite widths is probably subdominant for measuring the cm angular distribution in this process .",
    "the smearing due to isr and beamstrahlung appears to be the dominant effect modifying the cm angular distributions from their theoretical form .",
    "it reduces the edges and enhances the center of these distributions .    for the flat distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isr plots]i ) , the edges are significantly reduced by approximately 60% while the center is only enhanced by approximately 10% .",
    "in contrast to the effect of a finite width , the new distribution does not look parabolic and should be easily distinguishable . for the concave negative parabola distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isr plots]ii ) , the effect is small with a significant deviation from the theoretical curve only for @xmath180 . for the concave positive parabola distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isr plots]iii ) , the effect is to alter the distribution to look more like the  m \" distributions .",
    "this could make distinguishing these two cases more difficult , however , it can be seen that the position of the peaks in the two cases is different as is the shape of the shoulder and the concavity of the central region . with sufficient collision energy and luminosity , these cases should also be distinguishable . for the theoretically  m \" shaped distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isr plots]iv ) , the effect is to decrease the edges further while not changing much the central region .      in this section ,",
    "we have illustrated the use of our kinematical variables for reconstructing the cm angular distribution in the process @xmath181 .",
    "we have found excellent agreement between our reconstruction and the true cm angular distribution , even in the presence of a small finite width .",
    "additionally , we showed that the curvature of the distributions depended on the collision energy , which is in principle controllable at the ilc .",
    "we have further found that although isr and beamstrahlung modify the distributions , this effect is predictable with monte carlo .",
    "it appears as a reduction at the edges and a small enhancement in the center of the distribution . for most of the classes ,",
    "the essential shape can still be seen . therefore , in principle , it should be possible with sufficient luminosity to distinguish all the spin combinations using our kinematical variable except for those within case i where @xmath2 is spin-0 or -@xmath124 or between spin combinations within the same class when the masses and collision energy conspire to make the distributions identical . to end this section , we would like to discuss a few areas where the analysis of these kinematic variables applied to antler processes can be extended .",
    "in this work , we have only considered parity symmetric s - channel production of the two @xmath2s . in certain cases , parity violating operators may be important . in these cases , we may be able to further separate the spin combination cases as well as get information about the parity violating nature of the couplings by using the small solution .",

    "this is certainly true in the sm , where the process @xmath182 has an important contribution from a neutrino in the t - channel .",

    "we have assumed in this section that @xmath7 was self - charge - conjugate .",
    "however , this does not have to be the case .",
    "@xmath7 does not have to be its own antiparticle .",
    "although we have not done a full analysis of this possibility , we have found that the cm angular distribution in the case of the sm process @xmath182 is the same whether the neutrinos are dirac or majorana .    for our illustration ,",
    "we used muons in the final state , however , our method would work just as well with jets .",
    "the benefit of using muons is that they can be distinguished by their sign and their momentum can be measured more precisely than jets .",
    "however , in some models , the branching ratio to jets could be much higher .",
    "although the jets are indistinguishable , it does not matter for the symmetric distributions we have presented here because each jet generates the same distribution . in this case , the cm angular distribution coming from the large solution ( eq .  ) should be separately binned for each jet .",
    "the final distribution will have the same shape as that for an individual jet but will be twice as high in each bin .    in this work ,",
    "we have only considered the intermediate particle @xmath2 decaying to a two - body final state @xmath1 and @xmath7 , however , it could also decay to multiple visible particles and @xmath7 . if the multiple visible particles come from another intermediate state that decays ( such as a w decaying to jets ) then there is no change to the results presented here",
    ". the mass and spin component of @xmath1 are just those of the extra intermediate state ( such as the w ) . however ,",
    "if , on the other hand , there is no intermediate state decaying to the multiple visible particles , @xmath183 can still be reconstructed for each event , but the cm angular distribution depends on the invariant mass @xmath10 which changes event to event .",
    "it should , nevertheless , be possible to generate a series of cm angular distributions for each invariant mass range of the visible particles . however , the situation is further complicated by the fact that the component of the angular momentum of the visible particles will not simply be the component of the spin of a single particle anymore , further complicating the interpretation of the cm angular distributions .",
    "in this work , we have constructed a new kinematical variable that gives , under certain circumstances , the cm angular distribution , @xmath184 , of a decaying particle @xmath2 when one of its daughter particles @xmath7 is not detected . among the requirements for this method",
    "are that the masses of the mother particle @xmath2 as well as both daughter particles @xmath1 and @xmath7 must be known .",
    "additionally , we have shown that the magnitude of @xmath184 only depends on the component of the momentum of the measured particle @xmath1 which is transverse to the momentum of @xmath2 , which we call @xmath12 , as can be seen in eq .  .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath12 is uniquely related to the energy of the missed particle @xmath7 , @xmath21 , as seen in eqs .   and .",
    "therefore , if either @xmath12 or @xmath21 can be determined event by event , then the magnitude of @xmath184 is known , event by event , unambiguously .",
    "the sign of our observable , on the other hand , has an inherent two - fold ambiguity .",
    "we find that it can be consistently split into two solutions which we call the large and small solutions , based on the size of the component of @xmath185 which is parallel to @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the large solution always has a negative sign , as in eq .   while the small solution s sign depends on the energy of the measured particle @xmath1 , as in eq .  .",
    "although this sign can not be determined event by event , the distributions of the large and small cm angular distributions , eq .   and eq .  , respectively ,",
    "contain the information required to reconstruct the true @xmath184 in many situations .",
    "the large solution gives the negative absolute value of the distribution of @xmath184 , from which it is easy to reconstruct the full symmetrized version of the @xmath184 distribution by dividing it in half and taking the mirror image on the @xmath186 side .",
    "although this distribution can not tell us anything about the parity violation in the true @xmath184 distribution , it can give us the full symmetrized dependence of the differential cross - section on @xmath184 and therefore the spin - combinations of the mother and daughter particles which can produce that distribution .",
    "in many cases , this is already sufficient to determine the spin of @xmath2 and @xmath7 , where the spin of @xmath1 is already known .",
    "although the full structure of our kinematical variable was first described in the present work , a special case of this kinematical variable was applied to d - y production of a charged lepton and a neutrino where the spin of the intermediate resonance was shown to be unambiguously determined by the large solution @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the small solution contains nontrivial information about the sign of @xmath184 .",
    "although it does not agree with the true sign event by event , its distribution contains the clear signatures of the parity violation present in the true distribution . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in the special case of d - y production of a charged lepton and a neutrino , a simple reconstruction technique could be applied to the small solution to fully reconstruct the true cm angular distribution , including its parity violating features , almost exactly .",
    "it was , further , shown that this reconstruction technique was universal and did not depend on the spin of @xmath2 or the parity - violation .",
    "in other words , the reconstruction technique could be applied blindly and give the correct results in all spin cases . moreover",
    ", it was also shown that the parity violation could be determined directly from the small solution without applying the reconstruction technique .    in @xcite , it was also shown that acceptance cuts , and even the rather large @xmath187gev cut only affected the @xmath188 edges of the distributions , but left the majority of the distribution unaffected , preserving its power . in the present work , we extended this to consider the effect of a finite width .",
    "we found that an approximately @xmath125% width and smaller widths only affected the @xmath189 edges and the @xmath190 central region , but left the rest of the distribution unchanged , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dylarge ] .",
    "this shows that this variable works quite well for realistic d - y charged resonance production at the lhc .    in the present work , we applied our kinematical variables , for the first time , to the antler process @xmath181 at the ilc where @xmath7 was taken to be a self - charge - conjugate dark matter particle .",
    "we showed that @xmath21 is known in this case , therefore @xmath183 is known , event by event , unambiguously , as described above .",
    "we focused , in this article , on only parity - symmetric operators , therefore all our angular distributions were inherently symmetric .",

    "if the width is not infinitesimal , on the other hand , we found a small reduction on the edges and , to a lesser extent , a small enhancement in the center of the distribution occured .",

    "<S> we construct a new kinematical variable that is able to fully reconstruct the absolute value , and partially reconstruct the sign , of the angular distribution in the center of momentum system of a decaying particle in certain cases where the center of momentum system is only known up to a two - fold ambiguity . after making contact with drell - yan production at the large hadron collider , we apply this method to the pair - production of dark matter in association with two charged leptons at the international linear collider and show that for a small intermediate width , perfect agreement is found with the true angular distribution in the absence of initial state radiation . in the presence of initial state radiation , we find that the modification to the angular distributions is small for most angles and that different spin combination classes should still be distinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to determine the spin of the mother particle and the dark matter particle in certain cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of dark matter has been well established through a combination of galactic rotation curves @xcite , weak and strong gravitational lensing @xcite , big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite and the bullet cluster @xcite . from these observations , </S>",
    "<S> we know that dark matter is electrically neutral , non - baryonic and composes roughly 83% of the matter and 23% of the energy of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> however , these observations do not tell us the detailed properties of dark matter such as its mass , spin and how it interacts with visible matter . for that , we need to observe a dark matter particle ( dmp ) in the laboratory .    because the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics does not contain dark - matter ( among other things ) it is a low - energy effective theory that fits inside a larger , more complete theory . </S>",
    "<S> two prominent examples of these theories are the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) and the universal extra - dimension ( ued ) model . in the present context , </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important features of these models is the presence of a new parity symmetry with the consequence that the lightest parity - odd particle ( lpp ) is stable and ( if neutral ) a dark - matter candidate @xcite . in these theories , </S>",
    "<S> the lpp is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) and , so , can be pair produced at particle colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the international linear collider ( ilc ) .    to determine the spin of a dmp at a collider , ideally , we would like to boost into the center of momentum ( cm ) frame of its parent particle and histogram the angle of its decay with respect to the boost direction ( see figure [ fig : bldsystem ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will call this the cm angular distribution , where @xmath0 is the angle of the decay product @xmath1 with respect to the boost direction in the @xmath2 cm system . </S>",
    "<S> if the width of the parent particle is narrow , this distribution will correspond with linear combinations of squares of the wigner @xmath3-functions where @xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond with the spin and spin - component along the boost direction of the parent particle @xmath2 and @xmath6 corresponds with the difference of the helicities of the final state particles @xmath1 and @xmath7 ( see appendix [ sec : wigner d - functions ] for a brief discussion . ) the challenge for dark - matter particles is that they do not interact with particle detectors and are , thus , not measured . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , since we do not know their momentum , we often can not reconstruct the cm system .     </S>",
    "<S> decay of @xmath2 into @xmath1 and @xmath7 where @xmath1 is an observed sm - particle , @xmath7 is the missing dark - matter particle and @xmath2 is the parent of this decay . ]    in this paper , we introduce a new kinematical variable that is able to fully reconstruct the absolute value of the cm angular distribution unambiguously and its sign up to a two - fold ambiguity even in some cases where the cm system is not known . </S>",
    "<S> this method is a generalization of that used to reconstruct the spin of a new charged resonance in drell - yan processes at the lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our result is the following . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of the cosine of this angle is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the masses of the parent particle ( @xmath2 ) , the observed particle ( @xmath1 ) and the dmp ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath12 is the component of the observed momentum of the visible particle ( @xmath1 ) that is transverse to the momentum of @xmath2 in the lab - frame , and @xmath13 the two possible signs are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 which have been labeled by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , to be explained below and @xmath18 is the energy of the observed particle ( @xmath1 ) in the lab frame .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath12 can be expressed purely in terms of known quantities and the energy of @xmath7 in the lab frame as @xmath19 where @xmath20    the requirements for this method are that : the masses of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath7 must be known ; the full momentum of @xmath1 must be known ; the width of @xmath2 must be narrow ; @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath7 must all be on - shell ; and either @xmath12 or @xmath21 must be known . under these circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> even if the b cm system can not be reconstructed , the cm angular distribution can be calculated , up to the sign ambiguity outlined above . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will describe two scenarios where these requirements are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the first is in the discovery of a new resonance in charged drell - yan production of a charged lepton and a neutrino at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we will summarize this scenario and refer to @xcite for further details . </S>",
    "<S> the second is in the antler production of two charged leptons and two dark matter particles at the ilc , which we will describe in detail in this paper .    before moving on </S>",
    "<S> , we give a brief summary of other methods to measure the spin of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the spin - correlation in various cascade decay chains has shown that in many cases the resulting distributions were sufficient to determine the spin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been found that in certain cases the production cross - section varies with spin @xcite . additionally , the shapes of some other distributions have a dependence on the spin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these methods , our method has the benefit of reconstructing the actual cm angular distribution even when the cm system can not be reconstructed , in many cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : derivation ] , we derive these kinematical variables in detail . in section  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : dylhc ] , we summarize the application of these methods to charged drell - yan production and consider the effects of a finite width . in section  [ sec : antlers ] , we describe how the application of our kinematical variables to antler processes at the ilc can be used to determine the spin of dark matter . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude . </S>"
