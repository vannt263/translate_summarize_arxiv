    "level density @xmath10 and radiative strength functions @xmath11 of the dipole primary transitions of the neutron resonance gamma - decay provided us with a considerable portion of experimental information on both nuclear properties on the whole and nuclear resonances  in particular .",
    "nevertheless , there is an urgent necessity in determination of these data in new independent experiments .",
    "the ground for this is principle incompatibility of experimental data on @xmath10 and @xmath12 obtained in two - step reaction @xmath13 @xcite with analogous data from one - step reactions like @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16he,@xmath17 @xcite .    partial analysis of possible reasons for this discrepancy was performed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "it results in the following statements :    \\a ) transfer coefficients of total errors in determination of partial cross - sections of two - step reactions onto errors of the parameters under determination are much less than those determined in one - step reactions like @xmath15 , @xmath16he,@xmath17 due to other form of functional dependence between subjects  spectrum \" and  parameters \" ;    \\b ) the same concerns sensitivity of the determined parameters to degree of erroneous of hypothesis by bohr - mottelson @xcite ( axel - brink @xcite)for gamma - quanta ) of independence of interaction cross - section of final reaction product in reverse reaction with the excited final nucleus .    in practice ,",
    "error in absolute normalization of the two - step spectra by order of @xmath18 changes the @xmath10 and @xmath12 values not more than by a factor of two @xcite near @xmath19 .",
    "this is the largest systematical error in these experimental data .",
    "analogous error of the total gamma - spectrum normalization for different excitation energies @xmath20 in one - step ( according to the used analysis method ) reaction @xmath15 or @xmath16he,@xmath17 brings @xcite to more than 100% errors in intensities of all the spectra of only primary gamma - transitions , at least , for @xmath21 mev .",
    "the coefficients of further transfer of the indicated error on the determined values of the parameters , until now , were not determined by anyone .",
    "it is possible to suggest in this situation , that @xmath10 and @xmath12 determined according to @xcite have arbitrary systematical errors for different excitation and primary gamma - transitions energies .",
    "direct experimental verification of hypotheses @xcite is impossible .",
    "but , the possibility of obtaining functionals directly depending on unknown partial cross - sections of reaction for excited target - nucleus was found in @xcite .",
    "cascade population of levels determined there for the majority of @xmath22 nuclei up to excitation energy of @xmath23 mev can not be reproduced in frameworks of axel - brink hypotesis .",
    "however , they can be easily enough reproduced under assumption of existing enhancement of primary and secondary gamma - transitions to the region of  step - like \" structure in level density @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , complete notion of the observed by this method function @xmath24 can not be obtained due to lack of experimental data .",
    "but , as it is seen from comparison between the results @xcite and the data @xcite , violation of hypothesis @xcite is considerably larger than it was obtained in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , level density obtained in @xcite can be overestimated by several times in excitation region @xmath25 .",
    "most probably , this error gradually decreases at lower and higher excitation energy of nucleus under condition that the experimental data on density of low - lying levels and neutron resonances have significantly lesser errors .",
    "strength functions @xmath12 are , most probably , underestimated .    due to this reason , authors @xcite performed independent model - free re - analysis of the experimental data from the @xmath9 reaction in frameworks of only mathematical statistics with the least number of assumptions on parameters of small sets of the primary gamma - transition partial widths .",
    "it was obtained that the refusal from main postulates of  statistical \" theory brings to conclusion which confirms main results of @xcite .",
    "capture of neutrons in  filtered \" beams , for example , noticeably enough averages the gamma - transition partial widths in local resonances .",
    "this is true for nuclei with small enough spacing @xmath26 between neutron resonances .",
    "it is possible to observe experimentally the width @xmath27 with relative statistical error @xmath28 if its value exceeds practically constant detection threshold @xmath29 of experiment ( in any given narrow interval of gamma - transition energy ) .",
    "the portion of primary gamma - transitions of the same multipolarity and practically equal energy with @xmath30 is determined by concrete form of deviation distribution of @xmath27 from mean value in individual resonances and their effective number for neutron beam in experiment .",
    "it follows from main statements of modern nuclear theory that the amplitude of gamma - transition between neutron resonance and low - lying level is determined by quasiparticle and phonon components in wave functions of both levels ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "their concrete values are determined by fragmentation degree of the states like @xmath31 quasiparticles and @xmath32 phonons over nuclear levels at different excitation energy . in accordance with @xcite",
    ", this process is rather specific ",
    "strength of the fragmented state is distributed very irregularly . in many cases",
    ", its strength is fragmented over the levels lying near the initial position of non fragmented state .    in practice",
    ", this means that the @xmath27 values must strongly and locally depend on structures of decaying and excited levels .",
    "their dispersion relative to the average must be determined by number and value of the wave function components of these levels .",
    "therefore , fluctuations of @xmath33 can not be described by universal distribution .",
    "its deviation from the generally adopted porter - thomas distribution @xcite must be determined in every case experimentally .",
    "practically , it is adopted in analysis ( see @xcite ) that the sum of dispersions of experimental statistics uncertainty and  nuclear fluctuations \" is equal to @xmath34 with unknown parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the second assumption of analysis is that the gamma - transitions of the same multipolarity with energy of about some hundreds kev have the same mean value . in principle , this assumption can be mistaken and , for instance , mean widths of all the gamma - transitions involved in the set under analysis can belong to some rather wide interval of possible values .",
    "moreover , the probability of given mean value may increases as decreasing @xmath36 .",
    "this possibility is to be investigated experimentally .",
    "real width distribution around the average determines reliability of both data presented below and conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the values of level density and radiative strength functions of primary gamma - transitions obtained by analogy with @xcite are presented in figs .",
    "the distribution of cumulative sums of reduced intensities for the analyzed nuclei @xcite - @xcite and parameters of approximating curve have no principle difference with that given in @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are not presented in this work .    *",
    "* comparison of different data on level density for the @xmath0nd , @xmath1gd , @xmath2yb , @xmath3ta , @xmath4w and @xmath5os nuclei .",

    "the gamma - decay parameters of nuclei determined in @xcite are compared with results of two different in principle methods of analysis .",
    "accounting for results of theoretical analysis @xcite ( possible dependence of the wave function components of levels determining @xmath27 on energy of neutron resonances ) one can conclude that the discrepancy between results of two methods of analysis mentioned above is less than their difference from the data @xcite .",
    "it follows , first of all , from observation of  step - like \" structure in level density in both methods @xcite and close to zero or negative derivative @xmath40 for the same excitation region of nucleus .",
    "i d est , the local peak in sum of strength functions must be more or less clearly expressed .    the data presented in figs . 1",
    ", 2 confirm also conclusion on probable local increase in density of vibration type levels in the region of the nucleon pairing energy for a nucleus of a given mass .",
    "the shape of this dependence is presented in details in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , energy interval of the primary gamma - transitions observed in experiment is considerably less than that for @xmath41gd , @xmath42yb and @xmath43u .",
    "nevertheless , the data shown in figs . 1 - 4 bring to the following conclusion : notions of a nucleus as a system of non - interacting fermi - gas and ideas of other analogous nuclear models @xcite are insufficient for reproduction of modern experimental data .",
