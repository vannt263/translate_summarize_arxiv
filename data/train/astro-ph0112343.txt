    "binary systems are the most frequent form in which stars present themselves , at least in our local neighborhood @xcite , and it is generally believed that the same process of stellar birth commonly takes place in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , binaries have a significant impact on the chemical evolution of galaxies and even toy chemical evolution models can easily show that our universe would not have been as it is without them @xcite .    in collisional stellar systems , binaries can play a key role also in the dynamical evolution .",
    "in particular , binaries provide the gravitational fuel that stops and eventually reverses the process of core collapse in globular clusters ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    ". moreover , the evolution of binaries in clusters can produce peculiar stellar species such as blue stragglers ( bss ) , cataclysmic variables ( cv ) , low mass x ray sources ( lmxb ) , millisecond pulsars ( msp ) and possibly sdb @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of binary populations in globular clusters can provide powerful constraints both on dynamical models or on models of formation of exotic objects .    despite their potential interest ,",
    "the actual detection of binaries and estimate of the binary fraction ( @xmath4 ) in globular clusters has eluded the effort of researchers until very recent times ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of the challenging observational requirements .",
    "there are three main techniques which have been used to detect binary populations in globular clusters ( reviewed by @xcite ) : ( i ) radial velocity variability surveys @xcite , ( ii ) searchs for eclipsing variables @xcite , and ( iii ) searches for a secondary main sequence ( sms , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) parallel to the normal main sequence ( ms ) in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .    methods ( i ) and ( ii ) are based on the actual detection of individual binary systems .",
    "they require large amounts of observing time , since time series are necessary . method ( i ) also requires very high precision radial velocity measures that limit the luminosity range of the targets and place great demands on the quality and stability of the instrumental setup .",
    "these lead to observational biases and intrinsic limitations ( see  2.1 and  2.2 in * ? ? ? * ) and ultimately to a low discovery efficiency .",
    "thus , while these methods provide the only route to the physical characterization of individual systems ( masses , orbits etc . ) , they are maladapted to determining population properties , such as the binary fraction .",
    "in contrast , method ( iii ) is statistical in nature and does not need repeated observations .",
    "it is based on the simple fact that any binary system at the distance of globular clusters is seen as a single star with a flux equal to the sum of the fluxes of the two components . in the cmd",
    ", systems composed of two equal mass ms stars lie on a sequence @xmath5 mag brighter than the single stars sequence .",
    "if the masses are not equal the shift away from the ms is smaller and depends non - linearly on the mass ratio of the two components , @xmath6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass of the primary and secondary stars , respectively .",
    "while the sms can detect binaries of any orbital period and any orientation of the orbital plane , it suffers from three problems :    * the observational signatures of a genuine binary system and two blended , but unrelated , single stars are indistinguishable .",
    "thus , any sms in a globular cluster is contaminated to some degree by blended objects . * exceptionally accurate photometry extending to at least a couple of magnitudes below the turn off point ( to ) is required .",
    "any secondary sequence can be easily obscured by the observational scatter in the single star sequence .",
    "thus , while hints of a sms have been found in many cases ( see tab . 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the only definitive detections from ground based photometry have been in two very loose and relatively nearby clusters , e3 @xcite and ngc 288 @xcite . *",
    "the distribution of mass ratios must be retained as a free parameter while estimating @xmath1 , although some observational constraints on this distribution may emerge .",
    "* sms is very sensitive to the distribution of the mass ratios . to obtain an useful constraint on the binary population",
    ", the high @xmath9 part of the distribution must be significantly populated .",
    "sufficient photometric accuracy at such faint magnitudes can often be be achieved with hst observations , and sometimes with large ground based telescopes in optimal seeing conditions .",
    "the correction for blendings has a very complex behavior and can be made only via extensive artificial star experiments which precisely mimic the observations and data reduction .",
    "while the above framework was clearly recognized , e.g. , by @xcite , the full development and application of a method that properly accounted for all these effects emerged only with the seminal work by @xcite .",
    "these authors analyzed a large set of exposures taken with the planetary camera of the hst - wfpc2 , imaging a field including the central region of the globular cluster ngc  6752 .",
    "they were able to estimate @xmath1 from the distribution of deviation in color with respect to the ms ridge line using a large set of artificial stars experiments to correct for blendings and considering different possible distributions of the mass ratios .",
    "they found 15% @xmath10 % for the sample within the core radius of ngc  6752 and marginal evidence for @xmath11 % outside that limit .    we have used a method very similar to that of @xcite [ rb97 ] on hst observations of two partially overlapping wfpc2 fields sampling the central part of the low density cluster ngc288 . in ",
    "2 we will describe the observations , data reduction , and artificial star experiment . in ",
    "3 the method will be described in detail , outlining the differences with respect to rb97 .",
    "results and discussion are reported in  4 .",
    "once the binary fraction and its spatial properties are established , we turn to the analysis of the expected products of the evolution of binary systems , in particular bss (  5 ) .",
    "finally we summarize the results and provide a global description of the status and the evolution of the binary population in ngc288 (  6 ) .",
    "some preliminary results from the observations presented in this paper have been reported in a recent meeting @xcite .",
    "the observations were taken on november 17 , 1997 as part of the go-6804 program ( p.i .",
    ", f. fusi pecci ) .",
    "two wfpc2 fields were observed : one with the pc centered on the cluster center ( internal field ; hereafter the ` int ' field ) and one with the wf4 camera partially overlapping the wf3int ( external field ; hereafter the ` ext ' field ) .",
    "the approximate boundaries of the observed fields are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the position of the center of ngc288 ( according to * ? ? ? * ) and some characteristic scalelengths are also shown ( see caption ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the int field is almost completely within the half light radius ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the observational material is described in table 1 .",
    "the first column gives the name of the field , the second column the wfpc2 filter used , the third column the exposure times , and the fourth column the number of repeated exposures acquired at the indicated exposure time and passband .",
    "the repeated exposures have been taken after shifts of a semi - integer number of pixels in order to minimize the undesired effects of bad pixels and inaccuracies in the flat field correction .",
    "furthermore , such shifts guarantee that the same stellar images are sampled by different subrasters of pixels in each frame , thus limiting the effects associated with the relative position of the psf peak and the pixel / s collecting the core of the stellar image in the final averaged measure .",
    "the data reduction has been performed on the pre - calibrated frames provided by the stsci .",
    "the cte corrections has been applied according to @xcite .    in the present work we use mainly the f555w and f814w frames ,",
    "thus we will concentrate on these .",
    "however the general reduction strategy is the same independently of the passband .",
    "the relative photometry has been carried out using the psf - fitting code dophot @xcite , running on a compaq alpha station at the bologna observatory .",
    "we adopted a version of the code with spatially variable psf and modified by p. montegriffo to read real images .",
    "a quadratic polynomial has been adopted to model the spatial variations of the psf .",
    "the parameters that control the psf shape have been set in the same way as @xcite , who made an accurate analysis of the application of dophot to wfpc2 images . since the code provides a classification of the sources , after each application we retained only the sources classified as",
    "_ bona fide _ stars ( types 1 , 3 and 7 ) .",
    "the procedure adopted to handle the repeated exposures was :    1 .   the single images were shifted to one reference image and combined into a median frame , cleaned of cosmic rays and other defects .",
    "this step has been performed adopting standard iraf - stsdas procedures .",
    "the cleaned median frame was searched at a 3@xmath13 threshold with dophot . in this way we obtained a list of sources uncontaminated by spurious detections associated with cosmic rays or bad pixels .",
    "we then reduced all of the original single frames using the so called `` warmstart '' option of dophot , i.e. , forcing the code to fit _ only the stars detected in the median frame_. in this way we avoid the spurious detections ( taking advantage of the cleaning of the median frame ) , and we obtain a more robust and accurate photometry by measuring the relative magnitudes of the stars on the single frames .",
    "the final catalogs were cross - correlated and the multiple measures were averaged adopting a 2-@xmath13 clipping algorithm to reject measures in obvious disagreement with the others measures of the same stars .",
    "only stars with at least two valid measures in each filter were retained in the final catalog .",
    "the catalogs obtained from frames of different exposure time were merged by converting the short @xmath14 photometry into the photometric system of the longer @xmath14 catalog and adopting merging thresholds that retained the measures with the highest signal to noise ratios .",
    "the crowding conditions in our images are never critical , thus it was not difficult to derive robust estimates of the aperture correction at @xmath15 arcsec apertures with iraf / phot , for both the int and ext fields .",
    "absolute calibrations in the stmag and johnsons - cousins system have been obtained by applying the relations by @xcite .",
    "small shifts ( @xmath16 mag ) were applied to the ext photometry to transform to the int photometric system and thus obtain a homogeneous sample over the whole observed field .    since the @xcite absolute calibrations are intrinsically uncertain we compared our photometry to the only other published @xmath17 photometry of ngc 288 ( rosenberg , et al .",
    "we then adopted tiny first degree transformations to transform our photometry to the well established system of @xcite .",
    "we also checked our final @xmath18 photometry with that of @xcite and found excellent agreement ( see * ? ? ? * for further details ) .",
    "the final cmds for the int and ext fields are presented in fig .",
    "only the stars with @xmath19 mag and @xmath20 mag are presented .",
    "for the ext sample the saturation level occurs at @xmath21 .",
    "stars brighter than this limit are present in the field but do not appear in our catalogs .",
    "we will not comment in detail on the cmds here . in a companion paper ( paper ii )",
    "we will provide a deeper analysis of the evolutionary sequences and of the luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "the relevant points for the present study are : ( a ) the quality of the cmds is excellent , the average photometric error is @xmath22 mag over the whole range of magnitudes covered by the diagrams , ( b ) a well populated sms is clearly evident , and ( c ) a significant population of bss candidates is present in the int sample .",
    "syntheticly reproducing of the complete process of photometric measurements is the only way to properly characterize of all the undesired effects associated with observations in a crowded stellar field . in the present context",
    "a large number of artificial star experiments are crucial . as noted above the effects of photometric errors plus blending gives a signature quite similar to the widening of the ms associated with a population of binary systems . to disentangle",
    "the two requires a high degree of accuracy and statistical significance in any subregion of the observed field .    for each individual subfield (",
    "i.e. , pc - int , wf2-int , wf3-int , wf4-int , pc - ext , wf2-ext , wf3-ext , wf4-ext ) the adopted procedure for the artificial star experiments , was the following :    1 .",
    "a ridge line covering the whole range of magnitudes in the cmd was obtained by averaging over 0.4 mag boxes and applying a 2-@xmath13 clipping algorithm .",
    "the @xmath18 magnitude of artificial stars was randomly extracted from a @xmath18 luminosity function ( lf ) modeled to reproduce the observed lf for bright stars ( @xmath23 ) and to provide large numbers of faint stars down to below the detection limits of our observations ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "note that the assumption for the fainter stars is only for statistical purposes , i.e. , to simulate large number of stars in the range of magnitude where significant losses due to incompleteness are expected .",
    "furthermore , the actual choice of the lf of the artificial stars is not important in the present case since the final estimate of the binary fraction is based on stars _ colors _ ( see  3 . ) . at each extracted @xmath18 magnitude",
    "the correct @xmath25 magnitude is determined by interpolation on the cluster ridge line .",
    "thus the ( input ) artificial stars lie all on the cluster ridge line on the cmd .",
    "it is of the utmost importance that the artificial stars do not interfere with each other , since in that case the output of the experiments would be biased by _",
    "artificial _ crowding , not present in the original frame . to avoid this potentially serious bias",
    "we have divided the frames into grids of cells of known width ( @xmath26 pixels ) and we have randomly positioned _ only one artificial star per cell _ for each run ( a similar procedure has recently been adopted by rb97 , and by * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we constrain each artificial star to have minimum distance ( @xmath27 pixels ) from the edges of the cell . in this way we can control the minimum distance between adjacent artificial stars . at each run",
    "the absolute position of the grid is randomly changed in a way that , after a large number of experiments , the stars are uniformly distributed in coordinates ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the stars were simulated with the dophot model for the fit , including any spatial variation of the shape of the psf , and were added on the original frame including poisson photon noise .",
    "each star has been added to the @xmath18 and @xmath25 median frames and to all the associated single @xmath18 and @xmath25 frames .",
    "the measurement process has been repeated _ in the exactly same way as the original measures and applying the same selection criteria _ described in the previous subsection .",
    "the results of each single set of simulations was appended to a file until the desired total number of simulations was reached .",
    "the final result for each subfield is a list containing the input and output values of positions @xmath28 and magnitudes ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "more than @xmath29 artificial stars were produced in each subfield , and the total number is @xmath30 .",
    "the whole procedure was driven by an automated pipeline taking advantage of the large degree of automation of dophot . a set of @xmath31 experiments on a subfield",
    "was typically completed in @xmath32 hours , running on a compaq alpha station .    in fig .",
    "3 the differences between input magnitudes and output magnitudes are reported as a function of input magnitude for the artificial stars simulated and recovered in the wf3int subfield , chosen as an example case ( panel ( _ a _ ) : @xmath33 vs @xmath34 , panel ( _ b _ ) : @xmath35 vs @xmath34 ) .",
    "182,441 stars were simulated in this case and 145,608 were recovered .",
    "the plots shows that our measures are very accurate : for instance , the average @xmath36 and @xmath37 are both @xmath38 mag in for @xmath39 .",
    "the distributions of magnitude differences are not symmetrical : there is a almost uniform cloud of stars in the upper half of each plot that has no counterpart in the lower half region .",
    "these stars have been recovered with a significantly brighter magnitude than that assigned in input  they are the artificial stars that blended with a real stars of similar ( or larger ) brightness .",
    "4 shows the input ( left panel ) and output ( right panel ) cmd of the same set of artificial stars .",
    "note the excellent agreement between the observed ( fig .  2 ) and simulated ( fig .  4 , right panels )",
    "it is important to realize that the output cmds demonstrate the effect of the observation and data reduction processes on the input stars , thus it can be thought as modeling a function that maps the _ true _ distribution of stars in the @xmath40 plane into the _ observed _ version of the same distribution .",
    "stars in the right panel of fig .  4 have been subjected to all the effects that moved real stars from their _ true _ position in the @xmath40 plane to their actually observed one .    as a check on the ability to recover stars of the whole procedure we show in fig .  5 the completeness factors [ @xmath41 as a function of @xmath18 for each of the eight subfields corresponding to the different chips of the _ int _ and _ ext _ fields .",
    "note that the continuous line is not a fit to the data but is simply the line _ connecting _ them .",
    "the very low noise of the observed curves is a spin - off of the very large number of artificial star experiments performed . with the sole exception of the pc - int subfield",
    "the completeness is quite similar everywhere and is larger than @xmath42 % at @xmath43 .",
    "the worse performance of the pc camera are mainly due to a brighter limiting magnitude at fixed @xmath14 with respect to wfs , because of the smaller pixel scale .",
    "we tested the possible crowding variation within each subfield by comparing the @xmath44 curves obtained in different quadrants .",
    "in all cases the maximum quadrant to quadrant differences were @xmath454% over the whole magnitude range .",
    "thus , we concluded that the crowding conditions are very similar everywhere within each single subfield .",
    "our method for estimating @xmath1 is based on the comparison of the distributions of the color deviation from the main sequence ridge line ( msrl ) of the real stars and of appropriate sets of artificial stars originally placed on the same msrl .",
    "this is exactly as devised by rb97 .",
    "we can imagine the effect of observation and data reduction on a stars as a sum of pulls that move it from the _ true _ place it would occupy in the cmd : photometric error provides a random pull while blending or the occurrence of a real binary system pulls the star systematically toward redder and brighter positions .",
    "the artificial star experiments optimally characterize the effects of photometric errors and blendings associated with the considered observation but do not include any pull due to the occurrence of a real binary .",
    "thus , their distribution of color deviations from the msrl should be different from that of a sample of real stars if binary systems are present . to estimate @xmath1 , we produced additional artificial sets of ms artificial stars introducing a given fraction of binary systems , and then we compare the distribution of color deviations of the synthetic population to that of real stars , searching for the @xmath1 providing the best match to observations .",
    "we apply the method to the ms in the range @xmath46 , were the sms signal is most easily detected . for @xmath23",
    "the ms is nearly vertical in the cmd and no significant color deviation can be detected . for @xmath47",
    "the widening of the sequence due to photometric errors is too large to distinguish it from that introduced by a population of binary systems .",
    "the general scheme adopted is the following :    1 .",
    "stars are randomly generated from an appropriate mass function .",
    "the associated @xmath18 magnitudes are obtained from an appropriate mass vs. luminosity relation obtained from theoretical isochrones .",
    "the corresponding @xmath25 magnitudes are obtained from the msrl .",
    "2 .   a given fraction of the generated stars is assumed to be the primary of a binary system",
    "; the secondary mass is assigned by randomly drawing from a mass ratio distribution @xmath2 .",
    "> from the extracted @xmath9 the mass and the @xmath18 and @xmath25 magnitudes are assigned to the secondary star , the @xmath18 and @xmath25 fluxes of the primary and secondary are summed and the final @xmath18 and @xmath25 magnitude of the unresolved binary system is obtained . the final product of this process is a list of @xmath18 and @xmath25 magnitudes , a fraction of which has been modified by the addition of the flux by a companion . the total number of entries of the list is equal to the size of the sample of real stars we have to compare with .",
    "we associate to each entry in the list described above an artificial star having @xmath48 within @xmath49 mag and that has been successfully recovered .",
    "thus for each entry , either representing a single star or a binary system , we also obtain the corresponding @xmath34 and @xmath50 that takes into accounts all the possible pulls due to observational errors and eventual blendings .",
    "the final product is a list of synthetic stars with the _ same characteristics _ of the real stars , in which a known fraction of binary systems has been introduced .",
    "note that each real star has a counterpart in the synthetic catalog which in turn has a final @xmath18 and @xmath25 from an artificial star that was recovered in the _ same region _ of the field were the real star is .",
    "thus local variations of the crowding are taken into account and the whole process is done independently for each subfield . in fig .",
    "6 we show as an example , the cmd in the range @xmath46 for ( a ) the wf2int sample of real stars , ( b ) a synthetic catalog with @xmath51 , ( c ) a synthetic catalog with @xmath52 % and uniform @xmath2 and ( d ) a synthetic catalog with @xmath53 % and uniform @xmath2 ( see caption for further details ) .",
    "4 .   for each fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "100 synthetic catalogs are generated .",
    "each of these is one of the infinite number of possible random realizations of a sample having the same characteristics as the observed one and including a fraction of binary systems @xmath1 whose mass ratios are extracted from @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution of color deviations from the msrl of _ each _ of these synthetic samples is compared to that of real stars by means of a function of merit and the _ average degree of agreement _ as well as the _ dispersion in the degree of agreement _ is finally determined .",
    "the whole process is repeated for a wide grid of binary fractions and @xmath2 distributions , and finally a probability curve as a function of @xmath1 is produced for each assumed @xmath2 ( cf .",
    ", fig .  6 of rb97 ) .",
    "we now examine in more detail some of the single steps .      since our original aims included placing constraints on the distribution of mass ratios , we preferred to produce our synthetic samples by extracting masses instead of luminosities or magnitudes , as done by rb97 .",
    "our tests showed that useful constraint on @xmath2 from the sms morphology can be derived only if the _ true _ binary fraction in the sample under consideration is larger than @xmath54 % .",
    "we adopted a mass generating function ( mgf ) similar to that presented by @xcite , adjusted to fit the observed mass function of ngc  288 .",
    "the mgf is just a numerical algorithm that maps random numbers between 0 and 1 into a given mass distribution , the relevant characteristic being its ability to reproduce a realistic distribution . in fig .",
    "7 the luminosity function ( lf ) derived from the adopted mgf ( through a proper @xmath55 vs. mass relation , described below ) is compared to the completeness corrected lfs from the observed fields . in this case the samples from the wf cameras have been merged into the wf - int and wf - ext samples , while the pc - int and pc - ext lfs are shown separately .",
    "all the reported lfs have been normalized to approximately match each other in the range @xmath56 .",
    "the lf from the generating function clearly provides a good representation of the observed lfs .    to convert masses ( in solar mass units ) into @xmath18 magnitudes we utilized theoretical models .",
    "in particular , a @xmath57 isochrone from the recent set by @xcite provides an excellent fit to the observations once corrected for distance and reddening [ @xmath58 and @xmath59 , from @xcite ] , as shown in fig .",
    "we use the fitted isochrone to derive the @xmath60 function shown in fig .  9 , obtained by cubic spline interpolation .",
    "it should be noted that the only use of stellar models in the whole process is the conversion of extracted masses into @xmath18 magnitudes .",
    "uncertainties intrinsic to the adopted model or associated with small errors in the fit would have some ( moderate ) impact only on the assumed @xmath2 distributions .",
    "the actual @xmath1 estimates are based on color deviations from the msrl and are largely independent from the assumed @xmath60 function .",
    "significant samples of local field binaries have been studied by various authors @xcite , reaching a reasonable agreement on the general form of the distribution of mass ratios @xmath2 .",
    "the local @xmath2 shows a shallow peak at @xmath610.3 .",
    "the reality of a possible second peak at @xmath62 has been questioned since it may be produced by selection effects .",
    "@xcite has shown that , if all of the selection effects are taken into account , the observed @xmath2 is naturally reproduced by extracting secondary stars from the observed initial mass function , i.e. what would be expected by random associations between stars ( hereafter we will refer to this kind of distribution as to the _ natural _",
    "@xmath2 ) .",
    "there is neither observational constraint on the form of @xmath2 in globular clusters , nor theoretical arguments suggesting that the original @xmath2 in a globular has to be different from that of the field .",
    "however a difference in the formation of primordial binaries due to the higher environmental density can not be excluded . on the other hand",
    "it is expected that a binary population in a globular may be subjected to significant evolution through ( a ) ionization of soft systems , ( b ) binary - single star and binary - binary interactions leading to star exchanges and , eventually , ( c ) tidal captures and/or merging of the two components ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there is no reason to think that the processes leading to the disruption or merging of binary systems have some influence on @xmath2 , and the same conclusion is valid for the tidal capture phenomenon which is efficient only in extremely dense environments .",
    "conversely , any exchange reaction would tend to preserve the most massive components in the bound system and to eject the lighter ones , thus moving mass ratios toward unity .    given this framework ,",
    "the only possible approach is to keep @xmath2 as a sort of free parameter , by measuring @xmath1 under the assumption of different `` toy models '' for @xmath2 , as done by rb97 . while in principle @xmath63",
    ", this is not necessarily the case while dealing with the sms technique , since there is a fundamental limit to the mass of secondary stars that can contribute additional flux to their primary , i.e. , the stellar mass limit @xmath64 .",
    "this limit , coupled with the maximum mass in the ms ( @xmath65 ) , sets a lower limit in the range of @xmath9 .",
    "all of our model @xmath2 include this limit to ensure that we remain in the star / star regime and avoid star / brown dwarf and star / planet systems .    in the choice of the possible @xmath2 to adopt as test cases",
    "we have been driven by two obvious but opposite requirements , to cover the widest portion of the parameter space and to avoid an infinite amount of computing .",
    "thus we considered toy models covering somewhat extreme cases with @xmath2 peaking toward the extremes of the @xmath9 range , an intermediate one ( uniform @xmath2 ) , and the most realistic model one can simply conceive , a natural distribution .",
    "10 shows the normalized histograms of 100,000 binary systems randomly drawn from each of the adopted @xmath2 distributions .",
    "the lower limit @xmath66 has been applied to each of them .",
    "the distribution peaked at high mass ratios ( phmr ; fig .",
    "10 , panel b ) has been produced with a generating function of the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a random number within 0 and 1 . for",
    "the distribution peaked at low mass ratios ( plmr ; fig .",
    "10 , panel c ) with @xmath69 was adopted , the natural distribution has been obtained by extracting the mass of both the primary and secondary component of the binary systems from the mgf .",
    "rb97 modeled @xmath2 through distributions of the @xmath18 magnitude ratio in the form @xmath70 , where r is a random number between 0 and 1 and the exponent @xmath71 determines the form of the distribution .",
    "six cases where considered , @xmath72 .",
    "the case @xmath73 is trivial ( all binaries have @xmath74 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 associated with @xmath75 is very similar to our phmr , while for @xmath76 @xmath2 nearly corresponds to a uniform distribution .",
    "the cases @xmath77 all correspond to @xmath2 peaked at low mass ratios , with different importance of the peaks .",
    "a lower limit to @xmath9 similar to ours was achieved by adopting a faint limit for the magnitude of the secondary . in the end ,",
    "the range of mass ratio distributions sampled in the present analysis is similar to that considered by rb97 .",
    "we compared the red sides of the @xmath78 distributions of each synthetic sample with the observed distributions by means of a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test as done by rb97 .",
    "we sample the range of possible binary fractions at @xmath79 % steps i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "rb97 adopted a @xmath81 % step .",
    "for each fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 we produced and compared 100 synthetic samples instead of 1000 as done by rb97 .",
    "the latter two choices allowed a significant saving in computation time without any significant reduction of the accuracy of our estimates .",
    "in fact our tests demonstrated that in the present case ( a ) , the @xmath1 with the highest probability of being compatible with the observation is easily picked out within the uncertainties with a @xmath79 % step , and for case ( b ) the mean probability associated with a @xmath82 $ ] pair as estimated from 1000 simulations differs by negligible amounts from that estimated with 100 simulations .",
    "the present paper reports the final consequences of an extensive set of tests carried on to optimize the method and to try to extract all the possible information from the analysis of a well observed sms .",
    "the results of such tests oriented our choices and drove us to a step by step definition of the final method .",
    "it is interesting to note that in many cases an alternative to an approach adopted by rb97 for some specific problem turned out to be unfruitful , forcing us to follow their path .",
    "this may indicate that the basic characteristics of the method are indeed best suited for the sms technique .",
    "a detailed description of the many tests we have performed is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we plan to present the most interesting results in another paper ( monaco et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "however , there are several points worthy of comment here .    while it is valid to say that we adopted the rb97 method for the estimating the binary fraction , there are some differences in detail . for example , 1 ) we used a @xmath60 function and 2 ) we adopted somewhat different @xmath2 . in the end , we felt it worthwhile to describe our method completely .",
    "it is also important to note that the application of the method requires a very high accuracy in each step of the procedure .",
    "for instance , rb97 found small shifts in @xmath78 introduced by the artificial star experimental procedure .",
    "they were forced to adopt a msrl for the artificial stars which was different from the observed msrl . despite of the different pipelines and",
    "reduction package used , the same problem occurred in our study . for our ` fix '",
    "we felt that it was a safer choice to adopt a different msrl for each subset of artificial stars ( i.e. , pc - int , wf2-int , etc . ) .",
    "we verified that if the effect is ignored a significant fraction of the signal associated with the sms is lost .",
    "furthermore , the final msrls of each set of artificial stars is based on @xmath83 stars in the relevant range of magnitudes .",
    "thus the derived msrl is statistically a very robust representation of the mean locus of the artificial stars .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for the observed sample .",
    "while a robust msrl can be derived for the _ total sample _ , tiny camera to camera differences in the photometry can be present , hence ( a ) the _ global _ msrl may not be an optimal representation of the cmd of each single subfield and ( b ) the number of stars in each single subfield may not be sufficient to obtain a `` local '' msrl sufficiently good for the present application . since case ( a ) produces a small artificial ( and symmetrical ) widening of the observed @xmath78 distributions , fine adjustments are necessary to obtain consistent comparisons between observed and synthetic @xmath78 .",
    "otherwise , the relevant distorsion of the distributions ( i.e. , those associated with the red tail ) would be smoothed by spurious global discrepancies .",
    "we regard this sensitivity to small inaccuracies as the major drawback of the sms technique as developed by rb97 and in the present work . however , it is important to stress that if the described adjustments are neglected the fit to the observed data is worse but the final _ best fit _ @xmath1 estimate is unchanged .",
    "in fig .  11 [ panel ( _ a _ ) ] we compare the cumulative distributions of color deviations from the msrl ( @xmath84 ) of the whole observed sample to a randomly extracted set of 70,000 artificial stars without any binary systems added ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is immediately evident that the observed distribution is significantly more skewed toward large color deviations .",
    "a ks test shows that the probability that the two distributions are extracted from the same parent population is significantly lower than @xmath86 . from this simple test , performing a direct comparison between _ observed _ and _ artificial _ stars , we obtain a first very important result : _ the observed distribution of @xmath84 in ngc 288 can not be produced by a stellar population made only of single stars _ ,",
    "i.e. , the binary fraction of the cluster is not null , @xmath87 .",
    "note that the same conclusion is obtained even if subsamples of artificial stars of the same size of the observed one are considered .    since we have demonstrated that @xmath87 we can now turn to the actual determination of @xmath1 .",
    "this goal is obtained through comparisons similar to that presented in panel ( _ a _ ) of fig .",
    "11 . the observed sample",
    "is now compared with subsamples of artificial stars with varying fractions of binary systems added , according to the prescriptions described in  3 ( see  3.3 , in particular ) .",
    "one example of a good reproduction of the observed @xmath84 distribution is shown in panel ( _ b _ ) of fig .",
    "this example was obtained assuming a binary fraction of @xmath88 % and a uniform @xmath2 . according to a ks test ,",
    "the probability that the two compared distributions are drawn from the same parent population is @xmath89 % .    the results for all of the simulated samples are shown in fig .",
    "each of the small dots ( in the vertical columns ) shows the probability that a given simulated sample is extracted from the same parent population of the observed sample as a function of the @xmath1 of the simulated sample .",
    "the different panels of fig .",
    "12 show the results obtained assuming different @xmath2 ( from top to bottom : plmr , phmr , natural and uniform ) .",
    "there are 100 of these for each @xmath1 .",
    "the open circles give the average probability .",
    "the average points have been connected by a continuous line as an aid for the eye and as a first order interpolation between the obtained estimates .",
    "there are many features worthy of comment in fig .  12 :    1 .   independently of the assumed @xmath2 ,",
    "the observed distribution of color deviations is strongly incompatible with a binary fraction lower than @xmath79 % .",
    "2 .   compatibility with observations ( at least marginal ) can be obtained for 5 % @xmath90 % , depending of the adopted @xmath2 .",
    "however if we consider [ @xmath91 pairs which yield at least one case in which @xmath92 % , the compatibility with @xmath93 % remains only for the phmr case , and even then for only one realization out of one hundred . on the other hand ,",
    "the compatibility with @xmath94 % is excluded in all cases and @xmath95 % is only allowed for the plmr .",
    "hence , independently of the assumed @xmath2 , an appreciable compatibility ( i.e. , @xmath96 % in a non - negligible number of cases ) is reached only for @xmath79 % @xmath97 % .",
    "the _ most probable _ @xmath1 ranges from 10 to 20% depending on the assumed @xmath2 .",
    "as expected the plmr case provides both the highest @xmath1 estimate and the widest range of compatibility .",
    "this is because in this case most of the binaries are hidden near the msrl and the observed sms would be a minor component of the whole population .",
    "the estimates obtained assuming a phmr , natural or uniform distribution of mass ratios are rather similar .",
    "if these @xmath2 are considered , the @xmath98 % compatibility range is @xmath79 % @xmath99 % .",
    "the global field covers a significant fraction of the cluster within 2@xmath12 .",
    "thus , we consider the above estimates as fairly representative of the whole population in ngc 288 . therefore , we conclude that the global binary fraction in ngc 288 is 5 % @xmath100 % , independently of the assumed @xmath2 , while recalling that the range giving the highest degree of compatibility with observations is @xmath101 % .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the lower limit @xmath1 derived by @xcite .",
    "a very basic prediction of the theory of dynamical evolution of globular cluster is that such collisional systems tend to energy equipartition which in turn generates mass segregation .",
    "the heavier objects sink toward the central region of the system on timescales comparable with the relaxation time @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary rate driven by two - body encounters is quite low in ngc 288 because of its low stellar density .",
    "however , the cluster has an age comparable with the hubble time ( @xmath102 gyr ) which is much longer than its relaxation time ( either central or median @xmath103 gyr ; for either definitions and estimates see djorgovski , 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the cluster should have dynamically relaxed long ago , and the binary systems , that are heavier than single stars in average , are expected to be significantly concentrated in the inner regions .    to verify this we considered separately the int and ext sample to provide an estimate of @xmath1 in the two regions at different radial distances from the cluster center .",
    "we take advantage of the lucky circumstance that , with good approximation , the int field samples the region within @xmath104 from the center , while the ext samples the region between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , so the comparison of the int and ext fields has a well defined physical meaning .    in principle",
    ", one might desire to divide the sample in many radial annuli , providing an estimate of @xmath1 in each annulus and obtaining a radial profile of the binary fraction . in practice",
    ", this approach turns out to be unviable because the method needs large samples to provide significant estimates ( see also rb97 ) , so each subdivision of the sample would reduce the constraining power of the test .    in fig .",
    "13 the @xmath1 estimates for the int region are presented . a direct comparison with fig .  12",
    "makes it immediately evident that the ranges of compatibility have shifted toward higher @xmath1 values , independently of the adopted @xmath2 .",
    "the results are no longer compatible with @xmath93 % . the broad range of compatibility is 8 % @xmath107 % , while the most probable @xmath1 values ranges from 10 % @xmath108 % , depending on the @xmath2 considered .",
    "these results suggest that _ the binary fraction within @xmath105 is higher than in the global sample_.    fig .",
    "14 shows the results obtained in the ext region .",
    "independently of the considered @xmath2 _ the most probable binary fraction is 0 and in any case @xmath109 10 % _ ( @xmath98 % compatibility range ) .",
    "thus , there is a strong indication of a significant difference in binary fraction between the two considered radial zones .",
    "furthermore , it can be concluded that _ most of the binary systems in ngc 288 reside within @xmath110 from the cluster center _ , a clear effect of the mass segregation .    it is worth emphasizing that the above results can not be achieved by a direct comparison of the @xmath84 distributions of the int and ext samples , since they suffer from different degrees of crowding and , by consequence , have different photometric errors and rate of blending .",
    "it is expected that the stars in the int sample have , on average , larger @xmath84 with respect to the ext ones .",
    "it was essential to determine if the difference induced by photometric errors and blendings was sufficient to explain the observed difference in the distribution of color deviations and to correctly quantify the effect of these factors .",
    "this was exactly the aim of the adopted technique , without which neither absolute nor differential @xmath1 estimates can be reliably obtained .",
    "note that a binary fraction @xmath111 % , a value near the lower limit for the region within the half light radius , implies that 18 % of the cluster stars are bound in binary systems .",
    "since the evolution of such stars may be somehow influenced by the presence of a companion , it is evident that a moderate binary fraction can have a significant impact on the production of anomalous populations in the cluster ( bss , sdb , etc ) .    with simple and basic theoretical arguments it is possible to derive some useful ( though statistical in nature ) constraints on the origin of the binary population of ngc 288 .",
    "there are three possible origins for a binary in a globular cluster : ( a ) the member stars were gravitationally bound at their birth , i.e. , the system is _ primordial _ , ( b ) occasionally three single stars can have a close encounter leaving two of them gravitationally bound , the third stars having gained the excess energy , i.e. , a _ three body encounter _ , or ( c ) during a very close encounter , `` two unbound stars can divert enough orbital energy in the form of stellar oscillation that the pair becomes bound '' @xcite , i.e. a _ tidal capture_.    according to @xcite the number of binaries formed by three body encounters in a cluster having @xmath112 member stars is @xmath113 per relaxation time .",
    "the predicted number of such systems formed over the whole lifetime of ngc 288 is @xmath114 , under the very conservative assumption that all members have mass @xmath115 and adopting the total mass estimate by @xcite , i.e. @xmath116 . the rate of tidal capture can be roughly estimated with the analytical formula provided by @xcite . under the most conservative assumptions it turns out that the number of tidal captures that may have occurred in ngc 288 in its whole lifetime is @xmath117 .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that _ the overwhelming majority of the binary systems in ngc 288 have a primordial origin_.    binary systems in a globular cluster may be broadly classified according to the ratio between their intrinsic energy and the typical kinetic energy of the cluster stars .",
    "binaries are said to be _ hard _ or _ soft _ if their energy is , respectively , larger or lower than this value @xcite .",
    "as a general statistical rule , encounters between a single star and a binary results in an hardening for hard system ( the unbound star is accelerated and the binary becomes more tightly bound ) while soft binaries are softened ( the unbound star is decelerated and the binary becomes less tightly bound ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the average result of the evolution driven by single star - binary encounters is that hard binaries increase their energy reservoir and decrease their cross section for close encounters , while soft binaries increase their cross section becoming less and less bound . assuming an average mass of 0.2@xmath118 for the members of ngc 288 , according to @xcite , it turns out that _ all _ of the binary systems formed by two ms stars and with semimajor axis larger than @xmath119 au are _",
    "soft_. from eq",
    ". 8 of @xcite one finds that all of the primordial binaries with semimajor axis larger than @xmath120 au are likely to have had at least one close encounter in their lifetime .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that the population of soft binaries in ngc 288 has significantly evolved because of encounters with single stars , and probably most of the original soft binaries have been destroyed .",
    "finally , if one considers only the population of hard binaries , neither binary - single star nor binary - binary encounters are expected to have had a large impact on the evolution of such systems , in line with our results , the fraction of hard binary systems that are expected to have a close encounter during the lifetime of the cluster is less than @xmath121 .",
    "while it seems unlikely that binary - binary encounters do affect significantly the evolution of the binary population of ngc  288 as a whole , the mechanism may be relevant as a channel for the production of blue stragglers ( see  5.0.1 ) . ] .    to summarize these points :    * the population of binaries in ngc 288 is largely dominated by _ primordial _ systems ; * the present day population is likely to be mainly composed of hard binaries whose rate of evolution due to encounters is not great .",
    "it has to be noted that the above conclusions are based on the hypothesis that the stellar density in ngc  288 was not significantly higher in the past .",
    "this possibility is shortly discussed in  5.3.1 .",
    "blue straggler stars ( bss ) are hydrogen burning stars that presently have a mass higher than at their birth .",
    "this situation is thought to arise either via the collision and merger of two single stars ( _ ss _ collision ; a mechanism that may be efficient in the central regions of the densest globulars ) , or via the mass transfer and/or coalescence between the members of a binary system ( see * ? ? ?",

    "while there are only indirect clues supporting the collisional scenario , the link between ( at least some ) bss and binary systems is firmly established @xcite .",
    "however , it seems probable that either single star and binary mechanisms may be responsible of the formation of bss in different conditions , even in different regions within the same cluster or _ at different epochs _ of the evolution of a cluster ( see * ? ? ?",

    "if only hard binaries are taken into account ( @xmath129 au ; see  4.2 ) and a binary fraction @xmath130 is assumed ( quite likely for the cluster core ) @xmath26 _ bb _ collisions per gyr are expected .",
    "it is not clear how many of such encounters may ultimately lead to the physical collision between two members of the involved systems .",
    "however it is clear that _ bb _ encounters are a viable mechanism for the production of ( at least ) part of the bss in ngc  288 , unless the fraction of _ bb _ encounters producing a physical collision is significantly lower than @xmath131 .",

    "@xcite argued that during the phase of core collapse the extreme stellar density occurring in the core of m80 boosted the star - to - star collision rate , thus providing a very efficient mechanism for the production of collisional bss .",

    "if this were the case , it can be imagined that the peak of bss production rate coincided with the epoch of maximum contraction of the cluster , during which bss may have been efficiently produced by stellar collisions .",
    "the subsequent expansion decreased the collision rate to the present level , virtually stopping the production of collisional bss .    while this framework provide an explanation for the deduced variation of the bss formation rate with time , there are reasons to regard it as unlikely .",
    "in fact , to raise the collision rate at the required level it would have been necessary for ngc  288 to reach central densities some 100 - 1000 times larger than the present one .",
    "since shocks fasten the internal evolution , the cluster would probably reach the core collapse phase @xcite .",
    "even if binaries stopped the collapse , it would be very difficult to re - expand the cluster _ core _ to the present status .",
    "while most of the cluster halo may have been torn apart in the subsequent perigalactic passages , the dense core would have become very resistent to shocks .",
    "thus the cluster present - day density would have been sinificantly higher than observed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cluster experienced a shock so strong to alter its _ whole _ structure , this would finally lead to its complete disruption .",
    "since from its birth ngc  288 had @xmath178 perigalactic passages , probably it would have not survived to the present day .",
    "let s consider now the alternative hypothesis that the bss population in ngc  288 is dominated by stars that increased their original mass via mass transfer from their primary ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cj84 ) .    in this case",
    "the rate of formation of bss will be driven by the rate that stars leave the main sequence . at the age of ngc  288",
    "0.8@xmath179  stars leave the main sequence and might begin to transfer mass on the lower rgb .",
    "they might dump most of their mass down to some helium core , say 0.2@xmath179 , onto the secondary .",
    "if @xmath2 is peaked for large @xmath9 , say 0.61.0 , then the resulting star will have a mass 1.081.40@xmath179 . even for a natural @xmath2",
    "only 18% of binaries have @xmath180 so 82% of bss would have @xmath181@xmath179 . as the mass of the secondary increases the roche lobe moves toward the primary .",
    "mass transfer will take place more easily .",
    "indeed stable mass transfer can occur only in binary systems with mass ratio not too far from unity .",
    "for example cj84 assume a critical mass ratio @xmath182 as the condition for stable mass transfer",
    ". with this condition , the lowest possible mass for a present day forming bs in ngc  288 would be 0.92@xmath179 .    in the scenario described above",
    "there is a strict lower limit for the mass of a bss and the formation of more massive bss is clearly promoted . in this case the observed bss distribution may be accomodated with a rate of production running at a pace set by the evolutionary rate of cluster stars ( e.g. , see the predicted bss distribution in fig .",
    "2 g by cj84 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the cj84 model ( # 12 ) that is most like a typical globular cluster , a high specific frequency of bss is ( crudely ) predicted , @xmath183 within a factor 2 of what observed in ngc  288 .",
    "note that cj84 assumed empirically - determined distributions of binary orbital periods and mass ratios , thus the fraction of mass - transfer systems producing bss was not artificially boosted .",
    "the framework depicted above seems to provide a natural explanation for the observed properties of the bss population in ngc  288 without invoking a burst of bss formation .",
    "still it is clear that understanding the ngc  288 bss population requires more work .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of individual bss might help to distinguish between different scenarios , though the spectral signatures of the various possible origins are also not well defined @xcite .",
    "we have measured the fraction of binary system ( @xmath1 ) in the loose globular cluster ngc  288 using the sms method to identify binaries in the @xmath152 cmd .",
    "we employed a technique that accurately accounts for _ all _ the observational effects ( observational scatter , blending , etc . , see rb97 ) that may affect the estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "this is only the second measurement of this kind ever obtained for a globular cluster , the first having been made by rb97 for ngc  6752 .",
    "we find that the observations are strongly incompatible with the hypothesis @xmath184 % , independently of any assumption concerning the distribution of mass ratios , @xmath2 , thus _ the presence of binary systems in ngc 288 is confirmed beyond any doubt _",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we have estimated @xmath1 for various assumed @xmath2 , and have found that , independently of the adopted @xmath2 , _ the observations are strongly incompatible with global binary fractions lower than 57% or higher than @xmath185 % _ .",
    "the binary fraction in the region within the half - light radius ( @xmath12 ) is significantly larger than in the region outside this limit . for @xmath186 ,",
    "8 % @xmath107 % and the most probable binary fractions ranges from 10 % to 25 % , depending somewhat on the assumed @xmath2 . on the other hand , for @xmath187 , @xmath188% and",
    "the most probable binary fraction is @xmath184 % , independently of the assumed @xmath2 .",
    "hence , _ binary systems are much more abundant in the inner regions of the cluster , a clear sign of the occurrence of dynamical mass segregation_.    simple dynamical arguments strongly suggest that _ the large majority of binary systems present in ngc  288 are of primordial origin _ , and that single star - single star collision processes are highly inefficient in this cluster",
    ". thus the large majority of the bss in ngc  288 must have a binary origin . despite that",
    ", ngc  288 has a very high specific frequency of bss , comparable to or exceeding that of much more dense clusters . like the binaries",
    ", the bss population is centrally concentrated with virtually all the identified bss lie within @xmath105 from the cluster center .",
    "the selected bss candidates appear to have masses between @xmath189 and @xmath190 , and form a remarkably narrow and well defined sequence in the @xmath40 cmd . if the majority of bss have been produced by the merging of two binary member stars , then the _",
    "bss distribution is not compatible with a bss formation rate which has been constant in time_. on the contrary , the existence of a significant peak in the bss formation rate in the recent past ( @xmath1914 gyr ago and lasting @xmath1922 gyr ) is suggested by the comparison with theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the observations also seem compatible with a scenario in which most of the bss population of ngc  288 has been producted via the mass transfer occurring in close binary systems .",
    "the two globular clusters for which a robust estimates of the _ global _ binary fraction have been obtained using the sms technique , i.e. , ngc  6752 ( rb97 ) and ngc  288 ( this work ) are very different in terms of stellar density .",
    "the central density in ngc  6752 is @xmath193 times that of ngc  288 .",
    "it is very likely that the past dynamical evolution of the two clusters has been very different . despite of that ,",
    "the present day observed binary fraction ( and binary distribution ) is remarkably similar , at least at the present level of accuracy .",
    "however , while many details of the radial distribution of the binary populations are beyond the reach of the present day techniques , a first comparison of their broad properties is now possible .",
    "for ngc  6752 @xmath194 within @xmath195 from the cluster center and @xmath196 in the outer region .",
    "for ngc  288 8 % @xmath10 % within @xmath197 and @xmath188 % in the outer region . it may be presumed that a broad upper limit is set by primordial conditions and by the fact that in any globular cluster a significant number of binaries are _ soft _ ( and thus are rapidly destroyed ) .",
    "lower limits may be set by the equilibrium between destruction and formation of binary systems , somehow regulated by the density of the environment .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the global @xmath1 extrapolated from spectroscopic binaries and/or eclipsing variable searches in globulars is broadly constrained to be in the range 10 % @xmath198 % ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hence , two decades after the pioneering ( and negative ) results by @xcite , a very different picture of binaries in globular clusters seems firmly established : _ the binary fraction in globulars is not null ( and likely larger than @xmath199 % ) , but is still significantly lower than in most of other environments _ , i.e. , the local field , open clusters and star forming regions , for which @xmath200 % @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting results of the present analysis is the demonstration that _ the formation of bss via mass transfer / coalescence of primordial binary systems may be as efficient as collisional mechanisms , occurring in the most favorable environments _ ( see  5 ) .",
    "this is a further ( and quantitative ) piece of evidence indicating that _ large populations of bss may be produced in environments with remarkably low stellar density , if a sufficient reservoir of primordial binaries is available _",

    "this statement may have important consequences in the interpretation of the ubiquitous `` blue plumes '' observed above the main msto in the cmd of many dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) dominated by old `` globular - cluster - like '' populations ( as for instance ursa minor , draco , sextans and sagittarius , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively , and references therein ) .",
    "these sparsely populated sequences are usually associated with recent , very small episodes of star formation .",
    "this hypothesis is also supported by the presence of stellar species thought to result from the evolution of stars with initial mass larger than the typical to mass of old population ( 1@xmath201 vs. @xmath202 ) , such as anomalous cepheids ( ac ) and/or bright agb stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "even though the blue plumes lie in the region of the cmd populated by bss , bss are sometimes considered an unlikely explanation because of the very low density environments .",
    "the results presented here confirms that a dense environment is not a _ conditio sine qua non _ for the efficient production of bss .",
    "further , there is no reason to believe that primordial binaries are under - abundant in dsphs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . indeed , the few available estimates suggest that ( at least in ursa minor and draco ) the binary fraction may be even larger than in the local field @xcite .",
    "it is also important to recall that once a star more massive than the typical old to stars is formed from a binary system ( via mass transfer or coalescence ) , it will follow the evolutionary path typical of its _ new _ mass , thus possibly passing through the ac or bright - agb phases ( as succesfully demonstrated by * ? ? ?",
    "* more than two decades ago ) .",
