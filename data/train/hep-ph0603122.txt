    "<S> a great deal of experimental and theoretical works have been already piled up to confirm its existence and to understand its properties ( see , for example , a recent review  @xcite for the experimental results ) . </S>",

    "<S> exotic @xmath6 states were observed by the na49 experiment at cern  @xcite , though its existence is still under debate .    a very recent clas experiment , a dedicated experiment to search for the @xmath2 , has announced null results of finding the @xmath2 in @xmath7  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though this experiment is high statistics measurement , it is too early to conclude the absence of the @xmath2 , because the previous positive evidences appeared mostly in the reactions from the neutron and the kinematic regions of each experiment are different . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , several new experiments searching for the @xmath2 are in progress  @xcite . in the present obscure status for the @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> more efforts should be made for understanding the @xmath2 theoretically as well as experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a recent graal experiment  @xcite announced a new nucleon - like resonance with a seemingly narrow decay width @xmath8 mev and a mass @xmath9 mev in the @xmath10-photoproduction from the neutron target . this new nucleon - like resonance , @xmath11 , may be regarded as a non - strange pentaquark because of its narrow decay width which is known to be one of the characteristics of typical pentaquark baryons , though one should not exclude a possibility that it might be one of the known @xmath12 resonances ( possibly , @xmath13 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this graal data is consistent with the results for the transition magnetic moments in the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath14qsm )  @xcite as well as the partial - wave analysis for the non - strange pentaquark baryons  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , which implies that the @xmath16 seen in the graal experiment could be favorably identified as one of the pentaquark baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> being motivated by these new experimental findings , a great deal of theoretical investigations have been performed , which are summarized in recent reviews  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much of these theoretical works has concentrated on understanding the structure of these exotic pentaquark baryons . </S>",
    "<S> while the mass of the @xmath2 is experimentally known , other properties such as its spin and parity are undetermined </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the electromagetic properties like charge radii and magnetic moments , and various form factors are experimentally unknown . </S>",
    "<S> understanding such properties of the pentaquark baryons is , however , of great importance , since it will shed light on questions how the pentaquark baryons are constituted in terms of quarks and how they are produced in different reactions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the electric charge densities of the pentaquark baryons provide microscopical information on how their valence quarks and antiquark are located inside them , i.e. , as already discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , electric properties of the pentaquark baryons reveal their internal quark structure .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the present work , we aim at investigating the electric properties of the baryon anti - decuplet such as electric charge radii and electric form factors , based on the @xmath14qsm with isospin symmetry and symmetry - conserving quantization  @xcite imposed . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14qsm has been proved very successful not only in predicting the @xmath2 but also in describing various properties of su(3 ) baryon octet and decuplet such as the mass splittings and form factors with the same set of fixed parameters  @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of almost all form factors on the momentum transfer is well reproduced within the @xmath14qsm . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the parity - violating asymmetries of polarized electron - proton scattering which require nine different form factors ( six electromagnetic form factors @xmath17 and three axial - vector form factors @xmath18 ) are in good agreement with experimental data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is worthwhile to extend the study of the form factors to the baryon anti - decuplet within the @xmath14qsm . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as several models suggest , the pentaquark proton may contain a valence strange quark ( @xmath19 ) and antiquark ( @xmath20 ) , while the strange quark component of the proton is excited from the dirac sea . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is also of great interest to study its strange electric form factor and to compare it with that of the proton .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the formalism for the calculation of the electric properties of the baryon anti - decuplet in the @xmath14qsm . in section 3 , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the numerical results for the electric charge densities of the pentaquark baryons , and for their electric charge radii and electric form factors . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the strange electric form factor of the pentaquark proton with that of the proton . in section 4 , </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to see that the electric charge radius of the @xmath2 is only slightly larger than that of the octet proton . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the @xmath2 pentaquark baryon is quite compact , even though its main fock state component corresponds to five quarks . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effects are negligible , as we will see later . </S>",
    "<S> we can also find from table  [ table:1 ] that the electric charge radii of the baryon anti - decuplet are in general comparable to those of the baryon octet in magnitude apart from the neutral baryons . </S>",
    "<S> the electric charge radii of the neutral baryon anti - decuplet particles turn out to be much smaller than those of the neutral baryon octet ones . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath58 is more than an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies in the fact that in the present formalism the electric charge radii of the neutral baryon anti - decuplet arise only from the su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effects and are thus very tiny , in fact they vanish when the @xmath60 corrections are switched off . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss it more in detail later in the case of the electric form factors . </S>",
    "<S> the electric charge radii of the baryon decuplet are found to be larger than those of the octet and anti - decuplet .     with and without the strange quark mass . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig:2 ] draws the electric form factor of the @xmath2 with and without the current strange quark mass @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of su(3 ) symmetry breaking is almost negligible for the electric form factor of the @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature holds basically for all electric form factors of the charged pentaquark baryons . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this lies in the fact that in the @xmath14qsm the strange quarks are not valence quarks but arise from sea quark excitations due to the rotations of the system .    . </S>",
    "<S> in the left panel we depict those of the charged pentaquark baryons , while in the right panel we draw those of the neutral ones.,title=\"fig : \" ] . in the left panel </S>",
    "<S> we depict those of the charged pentaquark baryons , while in the right panel we draw those of the neutral ones.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the left panel of figure  [ fig:3 ] we depict the electric form factors of the charged baryon anti - decuplet , while in its right panel we draw those of the neutral baryon anti - decuplet . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to see that there is almost no difference in the @xmath22 dependence for charged pentaquark baryons with the same charge . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that there is no flavor dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the reason can be found in eqs.([eq : final1])-([eq : final3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the leading and rotational @xmath0 terms of the whole anti - decuplet are expressed in the first term of eq.([eq : final1 ] ) , which is just proportional to the charge of the corresponding pentaquark baryon @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the electric form factors of the pentaquark baryons with the same charge are identical when the su(3 ) symmetry breaking is turned off . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effects of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking on the electric form factors are in general small .    moreover , the various terms of the @xmath60 corrections are destructively interfering for the electric form factors of the baryon anti - decuplet as shown in eqs.([eq : final2 ] ) and ( [ eq : final3 ] ) , so that the symmetry - breaking terms turn out to be negligibly small . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the electric form factors of the charged pentaquark baryons appear to be almost the same .    in pure su(3 ) symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the electric form factors of the neutral pentaquark baryons vanish , since they are solely proportional to their charges . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the electric form factor of a neutral pentaquark baryon play a role of measuring how much su(3 ) symmetry is broken . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the right panel of fig .  [ fig:3 ] , the neutral electric form factors are negative , which leads to the positive electric charge radii ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the electric form factors of the neutral pentaquark baryons have almost the same @xmath22 dependence .    . </S>",

    "<S> the electric form factor of the pentaquark proton turns out to be almost the same as that of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> it is a remarkable result , reminding the fact that the pentaquark proton may contain the valence @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks in addition to the valence @xmath64 component . </S>",
    "<S> we can infer from this result that the @xmath19 and @xmath20 overlap each other , so that they do not affect much the structure of the pentaquark proton . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> its general structure remains very similar to that of the proton .    in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] , we compare the electric form factor of the pentaquark neutron to that of the octet neutron . as discussed above , the electric form factor of the anti - decuplet neutron </S>",
    "<S> vanishes in the su(3 ) symmetric case , while that of the octet neutron does not . </S>",
    "<S> though the general shapes of the electric form factors look similar , there is a large difference in the vicinity of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron electric form factor changes sensitively near the zero momentum transfer as @xmath22 increases , whereas that of the pentaquark neutron does slowly . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to the fact that the electric charge radius of the pentaquark neutron turns out to be very much smaller than that of the octet neutron .    . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve depicts that of the pentaquark proton , while the dashed one does that of the proton . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:5 ] compares the strange electric form factor of the pentaquark proton with that of the octet proton . since in some models </S>",
    "<S> the pentaquark proton contains the valence @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks , it may be expected that it has a larger strange component than the octet proton in which the strange quark contributions are bound to arises from the @xmath66 sea . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that the strange electric form factor of the octet proton has been measured very recently  @xcite . as drawn in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:5 ] , the strange electric form factor of the pentaquark proton turns out to be larger than that of the proton by around @xmath67 , while its general shape is very similar to that of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> this is again caused by the fact that in the @xmath14qsm the strange component is also a sea - quark excitation and not caused by a valence quark .    </S>",
    "<S> * 4 . * in the present work , we have applied the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath14qsm ) to the calculation of electric form factors of the baryon anti - decuplet particles and their electric radii , emphasizing their difference from those of the baryon octet . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed isospin asymmetry and have incorporated the symmetry - conserving quantization . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational @xmath0 and strange quark mass @xmath60 corrections were taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the only free parameter @xmath45 turned out very mild in general and we chose the proved value @xmath46 mev for which many properties of the octet and decuplet baryons are for many years known to be well reproduced .    we first have studied the flavor - decomposed electric density distributions of the pentaquark baryon @xmath2 , which provide information on the quark configuration inside the @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the peak of the strange quark distribution is located @xmath68 fm larger @xmath49 , compared to that of the up and down quarks . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the strange anti - quark is with higher probability found in the outer region of the @xmath2 , however still not too far from the up and down quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the electric charge radii of the baryon anti - decuplet . </S>",
    "<S> the results turned out that those of the charged anti - decuplet baryons are only slightly larger than those of the charged octet baryons . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the pentaquark baryons are quite compact objects , even though their leading fock - component corresponds to five quarks . </S>",
    "<S> apparently the higher fock - components have a noticeable influence . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that the @xmath1 corrections are almost negligible to the electric charge radii . </S>",
    "<S> this again indicates that the strange quarks arise from excitations of the dirac sea rather than being valence objects . </S>",
    "<S> the electric charge radii of the neutral baryon anti - decuplet become much smaller than those of the neutral baryon octet . </S>",
    "<S> the reason can be found from the fact that the @xmath1 corrections turn to be the leading - order contributions to them , i.e. when the @xmath60 corrections are switched off , the electric charge radii of the neutral pentaquark baryons disappear . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also presented the electric charge radii of the baryon decuplet , which are found to be larger than those of the baryon octet and anti - decuplet .    </S>",
    "<S> we also have examined the electric form factors of the pentaquark baryons . </S>",
    "<S> since the electric form factors of the anti - decuplet baryons are proportional to their charges in the su(3 ) symmetric case , their general tendency is simply the same in su(3 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> since the terms of the @xmath1 corrections are destructively interfering , the su(3 ) symmetry - breaking effects do not play any significant role in these form factors . however , for the neutral pentaquark baryons the @xmath1 corrections turn out to provide the main contributions . hence , these can be regarded as a measure of the degree of su(3 ) symmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the electric form factors of the pentaquark nucleon with those of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the electric form factor of the pentaquark proton are , remarkably , almost the same as that of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the valence @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks in the pentaquark proton overlap each other , so that they do not influence much the structure of the pentaquark proton . </S>",
    "<S> it means again that the pentaquark proton is a compact baryon despite of its five - quark structure . as for the neutron electric form factors , </S>",
    "<S> their general shapes look similar . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is found that there is a large difference in the vicinity of @xmath65 where the form factor of the octet neutron changes much faster than the one of the anti - decuplet neutron .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally have investigated the strange electric form factors of the pentaquark proton . </S>",
    "<S> the pentaquark proton may contain the valence @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks , whereas the strange quark component of the proton arises from the @xmath66 sea . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we anticipate that the pentaquark proton might have a larger strange component than that of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the strange electric form factor of the pentaquark proton turns out to be larger than that of the proton by around @xmath67 .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have found two significant features of the pentaquark baryons by studying their electric properties : firstly , even though their leading fock - component consists of five quarks , they are rather compact baryons , being comparable to the baryon octet . secondly , the effects of su(3 ) symmetry breaking do not play any important role in the case of the charged pentaquark baryons . however , those effects are leading - order contributions for the neutral ones . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> electric properties of the neutral pentaquark baryons show the extent of su(3 ) symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we plan further studies on other properties of the pentaquark baryons such as magnetic transition and axial - vector form factors , which will appear soon elsewhere . </S>"
