    "vacuum beam pipes of modern particle accelerators closely approach the ideal limit of a pipe completely devoid of gas molecules .",
    "however , even an ideal vacuum beam pipe in a laboratory at room temperature is filled with photons having an energy distribution given by planck s law .",
    "some time ago , telnov noted that the scattering of electrons on these black body photons could be a significant mechanism for the depletion of the beam . this scattering of the electrons in the large electron positron collider at cern ( lep ) on the black body radiation has been detected@xmath0 .",
    "there is a long history of theoretical investigations on the scattering of high - energy electrons on black body photons , centering around the role this plays as an energy loss mechanism for cosmic rays , which is summarized by blumenthal and gould .",
    "more recently , domenico and burkhardt have considered this effect for the lep experiments and the consequent limit on the beam lifetime by using numerical monte carlo methods . in view of the intrinsic interest of the problem of high - energy electron scattering on black body photons",
    ", we believe that it is worthwhile to present here a simplified calculation of the effect .",
    "we compute the total cross section analytically . the cross section as a function of the energy loss  which is the important quantity for the beam lifetime",
    " is also done analytically except for a final straightforward numerical integration .",
    "our calculations use relativistic invariant methods , and are thus of some pedagogical interest .",
    "analytic computations can be performed because the problem involves two small dimensionless parameters . on the one hand ,",
    "the electron of mass @xmath1 has a very large laboratory energy @xmath2 and it is ultrarelativistic , as characterized by the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "( we use natural units in which the velocity of light @xmath4 , planck s constant @xmath5 , and boltzmann s constant @xmath6 , so that temperature is measured in energy units . ) at lep , @xmath7 .",
    "we shall neglect terms of order @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature @xmath9 of the black body radiation is very small in comparison with the electron mass @xmath10 .",
    "thus , although the electron is ultrarelativistic , the energy in the center of mass of the electron - photon system is still small in comparison with the electron mass . the head - on collision of a photon of energy @xmath9 with an relativistic electron of energy @xmath11 produces , with the neglect of the electron mass , the squared center - of - mass energy @xmath12 .",
    "we shall use the dimensionless parameter ( which gives an average value ) @xmath13 at lep , @xmath14 .",
    "thus it is a good approximation to use the non - relativistic limit in the center of mass , with the relativistic compton cross section replaced by its constant , non - relativistic thomson limit . to assess this approximation",
    ", we shall also compute the first corrections in @xmath15 .    in the next section we use simple relativistic techniques to compute the total cross section for the scattering of an ultrarelativistic electron on the planck distribution of black body photons .",
    "the third section describes the more detailed calculation needed for the cross section in which the electron loses an energy greater than @xmath16 .",
    "if the energy loss @xmath17 in an electron - photon collision is too large , the electron s motion falls outside of the acceptance parameters of the machine . at lep",
    "this happens when @xmath18 is greater than about 1% . as we shall see",
    ", this means that even if the beam were in a perfect vacuum , it would decay with a half life of about two days .",
    "the vacuum in the lep accelerator is so good that the beam scattering of the black body photons is , in fact , the primary mechanism for beam loss when the machine is run with a single beam .",
    "scattering on the residual gas in the beam pipe gives a considerably longer half life of about six days .",
    "when the machine is run in the usual mode with two beams for @xmath19 collision experiments , beam - beam collisions reduce the beam half life to about 14 hours .",
    "in the general case of an electron scattering off some photon distribution , the scattering rate @xmath20 in the electron s rest frame may be computed using the formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the photon phase - space density [ with the normalization defined such that @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ jmu ] ) is the photon number density ] as a function of the photon momentum and @xmath24 is the scattering cross section , which is similarly a function of the photon momentum . here",
    "all quantities are evaluated in the electron s rest frame as indicated by the over bar .",
    "this scattering rate may be viewed as a time derivative @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the time in the electron s rest frame .",
    "since numbers are lorentz invariant and @xmath26 may be defined to be the invariant proper time of the electron , the rate @xmath27 is , in fact , a lorentz invariant .",
    "thus , if the integral on the right - hand side of the rate formula ( [ restscatter ] ) is written in a lorentz invariant manner , we can immediately evaluate the rate in the laboratory frame . in the lab frame , the electron moves with four momenta @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the world line of this particle , its space - time position as a function of proper time , and @xmath1 is the electron mass .",
    "this gives the familiar time - dilation formula @xmath30 where @xmath2 is the electron s total energy .",
    "thus the scattering rate @xmath31 in the lab frame may be easily evaluated using @xmath32    in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath33 may be replaced with the thomson cross section , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the classical electron radius .",
    "since this is independent of @xmath36 , the scattering rate may be rewritten as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the photon number flux four vector . since @xmath39 in the electron s rest frame , we may write this leading approximation , denoted with a @xmath40 subscript , as @xmath41 with the minus sign arising from our lorentz metric convention in which the metric has the signature @xmath42 . the result ( [ invar ] )",
    "is now in an invariant form which holds in any frame . with a thermal photon distribution in the lab frame , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the photon energy , the photon number distribution is isotropic , and",
    "so only the number density component @xmath45 is nonvanishing .",
    "thus , in the lab frame , @xmath46 the lab photon number density obtained from integrating ( [ jmu ] ) with the distribution ( [ number ] ) is the familiar result @xmath47 in which @xmath48 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "thus , @xmath49 is given by @xmath50    the first order relativistic correction to this result is obtained with the use of the corrected cross section @xmath51 note that the product @xmath52 of the two four - momenta is negative with our metric . because @xmath33 is no longer independent of @xmath53 , the corresponding form of eq .",
    "( [ gammawithj ] ) is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the stress - energy tensor of the photons . due to the isotropy of the thermal photons in the lab frame",
    ", @xmath56 has no off diagonal components , and it is also traceless because the photon is massless , @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , in the lab frame , @xmath58 the @xmath59 term is very small , and it may be neglected .",
    "integrating over the photon distribution in eq .",
    "( [ tmunu ] ) gives the well - known black body energy density @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "this yields the corrected scattering rate @xmath62\\ , .",
    "\\label{firstcorrate}\\ ] ]    for the temperature in the lep beam pipe we take @xmath63 , which is about room temperature .",
    "this gives the leading rate @xmath64 corresponding to the mean life @xmath65 hr .",
    "a typical lep beam energy @xmath66 is just above half the @xmath67 mass  within the width , but on the high side of resonance curve .",
    "together with the previous value of the temperature , this gives @xmath68 , and the first - order corrected rate @xmath69 , which is about 3% smaller than the leading rate .",
    "this gives a mean life @xmath70 .",
    "the calculation of the scattering rate in which the electron loses an energy greater than @xmath17 is facilitated by going back to the basic formula that expresses the rate in terms of lorentz invariant phase space integrals , an energy - momentum conserving @xmath71 function , and the square of the scattering amplitude @xmath72 .",
    "the total electron scattering rate as observed in the lab frame reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the initial and final electron four momenta , @xmath53 and @xmath76 the initial and final photon four momenta , with @xmath77 the time components of these four vectors . except for the initial factor of @xmath78 which is the lab energy of the initial electron and which converts the invariant proper time into the lab time ,",
    "the right - hand side of this expression is a lorentz invariant .",
    "the problem proves to be greatly simplified if the integrals are evaluated in the rest frame of the electron , because compton scattering of a photon on an electron at rest has a very simple nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this complicates the initial photon distribution , but , if we introduce a four vector @xmath79 , whose time component in the lab frame is one over the temperature of the photon distribution and whose spatial components are zero in the lab frame , the distribution in an arbitrary frame still has the simple form @xmath80 from the definition of @xmath79 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , because multiplication by @xmath79 selects out the time component in the lab frame . in the electron rest frame , @xmath79 therefore takes on the value @xmath83 where @xmath2 and @xmath84 are taken in the lab frame .",
    "we have not yet taken into account the lower bound on the electron energy loss in the lab frame . because multiplication by @xmath79 selects the time component in the lab frame ,",
    "this limit may be instituted by the inclusion of an  energy loss \" step function in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ tot ] ) , @xmath85 where the @xmath86 in the second term has been included to compensate for the factor of @xmath86 which the first term has picked up by being multiplied by @xmath79 . using the identity @xmath87 the final electron four momentum @xmath75 may be integrated over to leave @xmath88    we do the @xmath89 integral in spherical coordinates and take the @xmath90 axis to be parallel to @xmath36 , with @xmath91 the angle between these two vectors .",
    "the angle @xmath91 is the photon scattering angle in the electron rest frame , and @xmath92 the @xmath93 function can now be solved for @xmath94 to yield @xmath95 which requires that @xmath96 and thus makes the @xmath97 step function redundant .",
    "the scattered photon energy @xmath94 given by the @xmath93 function is , of course , just the compton energy . to deal with the  energy loss \" step function",
    ", we note that the lorentz transformation from the lab frame to the initial electron rest frame turns the lab frame isotropic black body photon distribution into a very narrow pencil in the electron rest frame in which we are now working .",
    "thus the initial photon distribution is sharply peaked about the average value @xmath98 hence we can approximate @xmath99 to verify this and assess the order of accuracy , we define the average more precisely by @xmath100 then , by virtue of the relativistic invariance of this definition , @xmath101 since @xmath102 is the only four vector available and @xmath103 .",
    "remembering that @xmath44 , this presents the squared fluctuation about the average as @xmath104 where @xmath105 thus the deviations away from our approximation may be neglected because they involve the very small quantity @xmath106 . using this approximation for @xmath107",
    "simplifies the  energy loss \" step function to @xmath108 where the @xmath109 in the original step function has been neglected because it is much less than @xmath110 .",
    "inserting the value of @xmath94 given by the energy - conserving @xmath93 function ( [ energy ] ) into the step function gives @xmath111 where on the right hand side we have solved for @xmath112 and defined @xmath113 which is the maximum final electron energy in the lab frame .",
    "we perform the @xmath36 integral in spherical coordinates , with the polar angle @xmath114 taken to be the angle between @xmath36 and , so that @xmath115 we rewrite the angular integral for @xmath36 in terms of an integration over @xmath116 by noting the limits @xmath117 and @xmath118 thus , with the neglect of order @xmath106 corrections , and remembering that @xmath119 , @xmath120 we shall do the @xmath121 integral last , due to its dependence on the initial photon distribution . in order to interchange the order of the @xmath112 and @xmath122 integrations , we note that the lower limit on @xmath121",

    "hence , switching the order of integration gives @xmath128 we perform this reversal of integrals , do the two trivial azimuthal integrals , and do the @xmath94 integral using the @xmath93 function to obtain @xmath129 ^ 2 } \\",

    "this lower limit must not exceed the upper limit @xmath134 .",
    "hence we must have condition @xmath135 on the @xmath90 integration .",
    "but again , this must not exceed the upper limit @xmath136 .",
    "thus @xmath137 , and imposing all these limits gives @xmath138    this will be evaluated in the nonrelativistic limit , keeping first order corrections in @xmath139 .",
    "the exact squared amplitude differs from its nonrelativistic limit @xmath140 by corrections of order @xmath141 .",
    "these corrections involve @xmath142 and are thus negligible .",
