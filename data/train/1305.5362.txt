    "in this paper we propose directional operator splitting methods for the numerical solution of fourth  order nonlinear partial differential equations of the type @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total variation ( tv ) seminorm ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the subdifferential of @xmath5 in @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) . here",

    ".    equations of the form typically arise in the study of tension driven flow of thin liquid films ( see @xcite ) , and have recently found applications in image processing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",

    "the type @xmath16 became popular due to their ability of preserving edges in the process of reconstruction ( see @xcite for instance ) . in the latter works the authors typically deal with second",
    " order partial differential equations , that is @xmath17-gradient flows of the total variation functional . instead , in @xcite",
    "an approach like is proposed for image denoising and image decomposition .",
    "when applied to image denoising , a given noisy image @xmath9 is decomposed into its piecewise smooth part @xmath18 , solution of at time @xmath19 , and its oscillatory , noisy part @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , in image decomposition the piecewise smooth part @xmath6 represents the structure / cartoon part of the image , and the oscillatory part @xmath20 its texture part .",
    "the advantage of using an @xmath0 subgradient of the total variation rather than an @xmath17 subgradient is that shows better separability of the data into oscillatory and piecewise constant components and it reduces unwanted artifacts of the total variation filter such as staircasing , cf .",

    "we define all the discrete operators that we use for approximating the spatial derivatives that appear in our numerical schemes .",

    "in this section we introduce the numerical method of directional splitting . in particular , we discuss three types of directional splitting : the peaceman - rachford scheme , the douglas - hundsdorfer scheme , and an additive multiplicative operator splitting scheme .",
    "+ in everything that follows we consider large systems of generic ordinary differential equations that arise from a semi - discretisation of initial boundary value problems such as @xmath86 for a given function @xmath75 .",
    "the explicit dependence on time of @xmath75 may not appear , thus considering _ autonomous _ systems . typically , directional splitting methods ( see , for instance , @xcite ) decompose the function @xmath75 into the sum : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the spatial dimension of the problem .",
    "the components @xmath89 , @xmath90 encode the linear action of @xmath75 along the space direction @xmath90 respectively , and @xmath91 contains contributes coming from mixed directions and/or non stiff nonlinear terms .",
    "a generic adi scheme constitutes a time - stepping method that treats the unidirectional components @xmath92 implicitly and the @xmath91 component , if present , explicitly in time .      the first method we consider in this framework is the second - order _ peaceman - rachford _ adi method ( see @xcite and @xcite ) where the operator @xmath75 can be splitted into @xmath93 , i.e. no mixed derivative or nonlinear terms are present .",
    "let @xmath84 be the time step size of the scheme , then for every @xmath94 the numerical solution @xmath95 of is computed as follows : @xmath96 in we can see that forward and backward euler are applied alternatingly in a symmetrical fashion , thus obtaining second - order accuracy ( see @xcite ) . in each half time step ,",
    "one of the two dimensions is treated implicitly , whereas the other one is explicitly considered .",
    "note that can be generalised to problems with nonlinearities @xmath97 and @xmath98 by adding @xmath99 and @xmath100 to the right hand side of the first and second equation in respectively .",
    "the scheme , however , does not have a natural extension for more than two components @xmath89 , so more general adi methods have been proposed in the literature .",
    "another adi method that allows a more general decomposition like the one in is the so - called _ douglas _ method ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in that , the numerical approximation in each time step is computed by applying at first a forward euler predictor and then it is stabilised by fractional @xmath88 steps where just the unidirectional components @xmath89 appear , weighted by a parameter @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "its size controls the implicit / explicit character of such steps . in other words ,",
    "the unidirectional operators are applied to the convex combination @xmath102 , thus considering fully implicit steps for @xmath103 , explicit ones for @xmath104 and a crank - nicolson type scheme when @xmath105 .",
    "the consistency order in time of the scheme is equal to two whenever @xmath106 and @xmath105 and it is of order one otherwise . in many applications",
    "we need to consider , however , @xmath107 ( for instance , if we are considering contributions coming from mixed derivative operators ) for any given @xmath108 .",
    "some extensions of the douglas scheme have been proposed in order to overcome this drawback .",
    "the following scheme proposed in @xcite by hundsdorfer is an extension of the _ douglas _ method where a second stabilising parameter @xmath109 appears : @xmath110 the advantage of this extension is that for any given @xmath108 the scheme has time - consistency order two if @xmath111 and one otherwise , independently of @xmath91 .",
    "the parameter @xmath108 is typically fixed to @xmath105 .",
    "its choice is discussed in @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath108 give stronger damping of implicit terms , lower values typically better accuracy .",
    "stability properties of this scheme when applied to linear convection - diffusion equations with mixed derivative terms have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "there , the preferable value for @xmath108 is @xmath112 . in @xcite",
    "the authors combine the approach presented above with iterative methods for solving nonlinear systems .",
    "as pointed out above , in both schemes and some explicit terms appear .",
    "these may affect stability properties of the methods and , generally , their accuracy .",
    "as described in @xcite , splitting schemes as directional splitting methods belong to the family of _ multiplicative locally one - dimensional _",
    "( lod ) schemes . in their general semi - implicit form ,",
    "when a splitting similar to holds , they appear as : @xmath113 where , similarly as before , each operator @xmath114 @xmath115 , is acting just along the @xmath116-th direction , whereas @xmath91 encodes mixed contributions . as pointed out above , it is generally difficult to deal with such an operator as the matrix @xmath117 is , generally , not tridiagonal .",
    "for this reason , the scheme deals explicitly with such a term .",
    "analogously , explicit components appear also when applying because of the alternating application of forward and backward euler . as we will point out later on , these explicit contributions may create stability problems in the methods we are going to present . following the strategy presented in @xcite ,",
    "our attempt is to modify such that no explicit contributions appear .",
    "the cost of such an operation will be reducing the accuracy of the method to order one , against the second - order achieved with the classical peaceman - rachford method . in order to preserve such accuracy as well as the symmetry of the method , at each time step two calculations are performed :    @xmath118    which , written in the same form as and , read as : @xmath119 to get the numerical solution @xmath95 we simply average : @xmath120 thus ensuring a symmetric splitting .",
    "due to the nature of such a method , we refer to - as _ additive multiplicative operator splitting _ ( amos )",
    "adi method .",
    "note , that this scheme is identical to an earlier version of the well - known _ strang _ splitting ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1.12 ) , p.329 ) ) . for nonlinear problems ,",
    "such a scheme is second - order accurate , in contrast to first - order accuracy of the classical _ strang _ splitting scheme ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the scheme - has the advantage of allowing a parallel implementation , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "as we are dealing with the particular case of regular domains in @xmath121 , we will consider in the following @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the @xmath123 component ( @xmath124 , respectively ) will contain operators acting just along the @xmath36-direction ( @xmath37-direction , respectively ) .",
    "when appearing , the term @xmath91 will deal , instead , with the mixed @xmath125-direction .",
    "our aim is to adapt the adi schemes , and - to regularised versions of equation in sections [ sec : prim ] and [ sec : primdual ] .",
    "we start by considering the auxiliary linear , fourth - order parabolic _",
    "biharmonic _ equation : @xmath126 such equation appears in many applied mathematical models such as the cahn - hilliard models describing phase transitions and separation in binary mixtures ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) . some work on adi schemes applied to the biharmonic equation already exists in literature .",
    "it dates back to @xcite where the authors consider the equation to model vibrational modes for thin plates and it has been analysed also in @xcite where linear stability results are proved as well .",
    "we are looking for the solution @xmath59 of the following semi - discretised version of : @xmath127 according to the rules of adi schemes , we decompose the function @xmath75 into the sum @xmath128 where the components @xmath114 @xmath129 are defined by @xmath130 and the differential operators have been discretised as discussed in section [ sec : prel ] . with this choice",
    ", we can find for every @xmath20 the approximating solution @xmath95 of using the _ hundsdorfer _ adi scheme .",
    "simplifying the problem by splitting the fourth - order equation into a mathematically equivalent autonomous system of two partial differential equations of order two produces the system : @xmath131 then , the _ hundsdorfer _ scheme applied to can be equivalently written as a coupled adi scheme for approximate solutions @xmath132 of . for positive parameters @xmath133 this",
    "gives : @xmath134 where the functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 are given by : @xmath137    to verify that gives the same solution as the _ hundsdorfer _ scheme applied to we consider as example the first implicit step in providing the approximations @xmath138 .",
    "for the approximation @xmath139 of @xmath95 we have : @xmath140 using now the expression of @xmath141 given by the implicit step relating to the equation for @xmath142 we have : @xmath143 which , compared to the respective step performed applying the _ hundsdorfer _ scheme to equation , gives exactly the same result .",
    "we perform the same technique for the other implicit steps . moreover , as the reader may note , in both the explicit steps of the scheme above we swapped the order of application of the method for consistency issues .",
    "namely , we first find consistent approximations for @xmath144 using them to get consistent approximations of @xmath95 . in the application of both these methods we get stable solutions both for @xmath145 and also for @xmath146 , improving largely upon the condition @xmath147 that a naive explicit discretisation would give .",
    "scheme is indeed _ unconditionally _ stable , as proved earlier in @xcite and confirmed in our numerical experiments in section [ sec : numres ] .",
    "however , note that considering bigger time steps such as @xmath148 the numerical accuracy suffers not producing sensible solutions .",
    "we now aim to derive an adi method solving the tv-@xmath0 equation .",
    "expanding directly the differential operators appearing in the equation generates an intractable number of nonlinear terms of various differential orders .",
    "this makes a direct application of the adi scheme to impractical .",
    "therefore , following the ideas presented in section  [ sec : bih ] , we reduce the original fourth - order equation to an autonomous system of two second - order equations . in",
    "the following we consider the _ primal _ formulation of , in contrast to the _ primal - dual _ formulation presented in section [ sec : primdual ] .",
    "to do so , we first regularise the subgradient of the total variation in characterised by .",
    "we use the standard _",
    "square root @xmath33-regularisation _ that replaces @xmath38 by @xmath149 , see for instance @xcite .",
    "this results in the following regularised version of @xmath150 in the following we present two different linearisations of the problem above .",
    "heuristically , such a choice is important from two different points of view , intrinsically related to each other .",
    "the former is the accuracy of the scheme we are considering : rough linearisations ( i.e.  linearisations which consider most of the nonlinear terms explicitly evaluating them in one or more given approximations of the solution in previous time steps ) are likely to present poor accuracy as well as stability issues .",
    "this is a general consideration in the numerical solution of every partial differential equation and it has to be taken into account and balanced with the choice of linearisation which might be more accurate and precise , but which could present , on the other hand , difficulties in its implementation and application .",
    "the latter point of view is , in some sense , peculiar to our choice of performing a directional splitting scheme . as pointed out above ,",
    "our purpose is splitting our partial differential operator into the sum of components which are considered both explicitly ( see @xmath91 above ) and implicitly ( see @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) , as in .",
    "as we are going to present in the following , the choice of the linearisation affects such a splitting as the @xmath91 component and the linearised quantities multiplying the differential operators acting in @xmath36 and @xmath37 may change accordingly . for instance , the @xmath91 component might not appear changing the choice of the adi scheme we want to use .    in the following we proceed by presenting two adi schemes of the form and for two different linearisations of .",
    "for a given initial condition @xmath151 , our problem consists in finding an approximation @xmath152 of the solution @xmath153 to for every @xmath154 . in the following we always linearise around the solution at the previous time step @xmath155 .      indicating by @xmath156 the value of the solution @xmath157 in the previous time step , our first choice of linearisation is the following ( compare with @xcite ) : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the semi - discrete approximation to a solution of . here , the linearisation of @xmath142 constitutes a semi - implicit approximation of the second - order nonlinear diffusion , evaluating all the first - order derivatives of the expansion in the previous time step . as before , we use the following notation for the system : @xmath160 for suitable matrices @xmath161 and @xmath162 in @xmath163 .",
    "we split @xmath75 and @xmath81 into the sum of three different terms : @xmath91 and @xmath164 containing the mixed derivative term and @xmath165 and @xmath166 containing the derivatives with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath37 only , respectively .",
    "this produces the splitting : @xmath167 with : @xmath168 due to the presence of a mixed derivative operator , a simple _ peaceman - rachford _ scheme can not be applied .",
    "the _ hundsdorfer _ scheme is needed .",
    "the adi scheme we use has the same form as for the biharmonic equation , i.e.  we employ with @xmath169 and @xmath170 given by , .",
    "another possibility is to linearise the system in the following way : @xmath171 where again @xmath172 and the spatial quantities are discretised as above and the discrete operators @xmath173 and @xmath174 are defined below .",
    "we observe that with this choice no mixed derivative operator acting on @xmath59 appears .",
    "mixed terms are encoded and considered in the previous time step . on the other hand ,",
    "we get first derivative operators and not just second - order ones as in .",
    "writing again the system as in , we now split @xmath75 and @xmath81 in the following way : @xmath175 where @xmath176 we note that the splitting is a two - components splitting as the one provided for the _ peaceman - rachford _ adi scheme applied to the system and this gives : @xmath177 for the discretisation of the first derivative operators in the scheme ",
    "present in the equation for @xmath142 in  we use the standard numerical technique of upwinding , i.e. the sign of the coefficients in front of the first derivatives terms affects in which direction the finite differences are computed .",
    "more precisely , we use : @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath180 is the indicator function for the set @xmath181 .",
    "a numerical discussion pointing out the differences of the adi schemes resulting from the two linearisations and follows in section [ sec : numres ] .      as we are going to illustrate numerically in section  [ sec : numres ] , a stable application of the adi schemes to equation depends on the choice of the regularising parameter @xmath33 . in order to use reasonably large time steps",
    "@xmath30 , this parameter has to be taken sufficiently large to get stable results for the numerical solution of . for the following stability consideration we use the terminology introduced in definition [ def_stab ] where we consider the solution continuous in space and discrete in time .",
    "fully explicit numerical schemes solving tv gradient flows turn out to show restrictive stability conditions related to the strength of the nonlinearity in the tv subgradient , cf . @xcite . on the other hand , fully implicit schemes solving without any operator splitting are unconditionally stable .",
    "in particular , we have the following stability theorem :    let @xmath9 be a sufficiently regular initial condition and @xmath82 the solution of @xmath182 then , the following stability estimate holds @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "multiplying equation by @xmath185 ( where @xmath186 is the inverse of the negative laplacian with zero boundary conditions ) and integrating over @xmath45 we get : @xmath187 where @xmath188 denotes the @xmath17 inner product .",
    "we can rewrite the left hand side of the equation above using the properties of @xmath186 and applying the divergence theorem , thus finding : @xmath189 we can now apply the result provided in @xcite and summing over all @xmath190 up to @xmath191 , finding the following stability estimate : @xmath192 where @xmath193 , which gives .",
    "in particular , estimate does not depend on the size of @xmath33 .",
    "these considerations about explicit and implicit schemes solving directly ( i.e. without any splitting ) our problem serve as a motivation for the following estimates .",
    "we focus on the _ hundsdorfer _ scheme applied to the tv-@xmath0 equation with the choice , . in each iteration",
    "the numerical solution is computed from equations consisting of a combination of explicit and implicit quantities . in particular",
    ", the explicit quantities might affect the stability properties of the scheme . to motivate this , we focus in the following just on the first three stages of the scheme applied to the tv-@xmath0 equation with the choice , and @xmath105 . considering the first three stages of",
    "only can be justified by the fact that the subsequent three stages of the scheme have a similar structure and are not expected to change the stability properties drastically .    combining the three steps of the scheme with , we find the following expression : @xmath194 where @xmath195 denotes the continuous derivative with respect to @xmath36 and the positive quantities @xmath196 and @xmath197 come from the linearisation described in section  [ sec : lin1 ] .",
    "they read : @xmath198 we observe that a mixed , eighth - order operator appears , both on the left and on the right hand side of . in the following stability discussion we neglect these high - order terms which only represent second - order in time contributions",
    "now , we multiply equation by @xmath83 and integrate over the domain @xmath45 . by applying integration by parts twice with respect to the @xmath36 and the @xmath37 variables to the second and the third terms of the left hand side of the equation , respectively ,",
    "we get : @xmath199 here @xmath200 is a suitable constant that depends on the regularising parameter @xmath33 only .",
