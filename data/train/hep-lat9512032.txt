    "one possible way of regularizing a continuum quantum field theory is to introduce a lattice as a uv regulator .",
    "an additional benefit of this method is that it opens the door to computer simulations .",
    "however , by naively discretizing physical observables , the correct values are only obtained in the continuum limit , when the lattice spacing is going to zero . at finite lattice spacing the lattice",
    "induces systematic errors ( cutoff effects ) . in order to remove these cutoff effects",
    "one has to introduce finer and finer lattices , and finally extrapolate the calculated quantities to the continuum limit .",
    "this delicate limit is a major difficulty in extracting continuum physics from the lattice .",
    "it is possible to circumvent this problem by using wilson s renormalization group theory .",
    "if one constructs the lattice action and all operators in a form that corresponds to the renormalized trajectory , one obtains results that do not depend on the lattice spacing .",
    "it has been shown in a series of papers recently published @xcite that it is possible to construct a fixed point action for asymptotically free theories .",
    "this action is the fixed point ( fp ) of an exact renormalization group ( rg ) transformation and as such may be taken as a first approximation to the renormalized trajectory .    as a pilot project",
    "a local parametrization of the fp action was constructed in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model , and used in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the result was very promising : although the fp action is perfect strictly only classically , no cutoff effects were seen even at small correlation lengths ( @xmath3 ) .    in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    "a fp topological charge was proposed .",
    "it was shown , that the combination fp action and fp charge has no topological defects .",
    "the fp action has the correct value for instanton solutions , and does not depend on the scale of the instanton .",
    "hence it admits stable instanton solutions on the lattice .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard lattice action , whose value depends on the instanton scale , and which suffers from dislocations @xcite .",
    "these dislocations were suspected to be responsible for the non scaling behavior of the topological susceptibility in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model .",
    "however , using parametrizations of the fp action and the fp topological charge in a monte carlo simulation , even with the absence of dislocations a strong violation of scaling of the topological susceptibility was established @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the topological susceptibility is not a physical quantity in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model .",
    "this observation is supported by results of semiclassical approximations @xcite , where the instanton size distribution is divergent for small instanton sizes .    in @xmath0 models with @xmath4",
    ", however , semiclassical approximation indicates that there is no dominance of small instantons .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath5 dislocations are suppressed even for the standard lattice action @xcite .",
    "it should , therefore , be possible , to determine unambiguously the topological susceptibility in these models .",
    "on the other hand , there were several recent determinations of the topological susceptibility in the @xmath1 model , using different discretizations of the action and the topological charge @xcite ; but the results of these determinations are partly in plain contradiction with each other .",
    "the situation is therefore by no means clear .",
    "we suggest to use the same concepts and methods in order to determine the topological susceptibility as was proposed in ref .",

    "[ actionsection ] we construct a classical perfect lattice action for the @xmath1 model along the same lines as in ref .",

    "we give a parametrization of the fp action , that works reasonably well even for coarse grained fields . in sec .",
    "[ chargesection ] we define a fp topological charge along the lines of in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in order to use the fp charge in numerical simulations , we construct a parametrization of the dependence of the fine field on a coarse input field . in sec .",
    "[ susceptsection ] we discuss the topological susceptibility and the influence of a lattice regularization on its measurement .",
    "finally , we present the results of numerical simulations using the fp action and the fp charge .",
    "two - dimensional @xmath0 models are an important testing ground for methods in quantum field theories because of their similarities with four - dimensional non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "important common properties are asymptotic freedom , dynamical mass generation , confinement of non - gauge - invariant states and a nontrivial topology . despite these common features ,",
    "two - dimensional spin models are much easier to handle both analytically and numerically .",
    "the @xmath0 model ( in the continuum ) consists of a @xmath7-component complex spin field @xmath8 which satisfies the constraint @xmath9=1 .",
    "the action has a global @xmath10 symmetry and a local @xmath11 ( gauge ) symmetry .",
    "the gauge field , however , is not independent and can be expressed in the basic field @xmath12 . only after quantization , the gauge field becomes dynamical , and gives rise to a confining potential , as is explicitly seen in the large-@xmath7 limit @xcite . in the following it will sometimes prove useful , not to use the basic field @xmath12 , but the gauge invariant composite operator @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath14 the @xmath15 model is equivalent to the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model and @xmath16 can be written in terms of the usual o(3 ) covariant spins @xmath17 as @xmath18 . here",

    "if one approaches the continuum limit , each of it will give the same results .",
    "we choose for this study a discretization , which does not use an explicit gauge field .",
    "the standard lattice action without gauge fields assumes the form @xmath21 for @xmath14 this goes over to the standard lattice action of the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model , which is not the case if one would use a formulation with an explicit gauge field .",
    "the parametrization of the fp action will be a generalization of the standard action , taking into account couplings between two spins , that are more distant than nearest neighbor and also multispin couplings between up to four spins .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 model on a two - dimensional square lattice with variables @xmath22 at each lattice site @xmath23 .",
    "then we perform an exact rg transformation . for this",
    "we split the lattice into @xmath24 blocks @xmath25 and with each block we associate a block spin @xmath26 .",
    "we define the ( gauge invariant ) rg transformation as an averaging over the fine spins in one block , that has the form @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is a free parameter of the rg transformation , and the normalizing factor @xmath29 assures , that the partition function does not change under the rg transformation @xmath30 the form of the rg transformation in eq .",

    "consider the unitary matrix @xmath32 it is just the sum of the composite operators @xmath33 at every site of a block .",
    "let the hermitian matrix @xmath34 have eigenvalues @xmath35 and eigenvectors @xmath36 . because @xmath34 is gauge invariant ,",

    "( [ rg - trafo ] ) @xmath37 in the limit @xmath38 we perform a saddle point approximation .",
    "we get to lowest order @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath34 .",
    "the fp of the rg transformation ( [ rg - trafo ] ) is determined in this limit by the implicit equation ( fp  equation ) @xmath41 with the transformation kernel @xmath42 the kernel @xmath43 is gauge invariant in a strong sense : it does not change under independent gauge transformations on either the coarse _ or _ on the fine spins .",
    "this is more than would be needed : in a general case it would be sufficient , that the kernel is gauge invariant under a combined gauge transformation on the coarse _ and _ the fine spins .",
    "the gauge invariance of the kernel assures , that if the action @xmath44 of the fine field is gauge invariant , then also the action @xmath45 of the coarse field after the rg transformation is gauge invariant .",
    "the fp  equation  ( [ fp - equation ] ) determines the value of the fp action for a given input configuration @xmath46 .",
    "one may solve this equation iteratively , leading to a minimization on a multigrid of lattice configurations with the configuration @xmath46 on the coarsest level , and with @xmath47 finer configurations @xmath48 on successive levels : @xmath49 on each successive level the spin configurations become smoother and smoother , hence one may choose for the action @xmath50 on the finest configuration @xmath48 any lattice discretization of the continuum action .",
    "the fp action @xmath51 is then obtained in the limit @xmath52 of @xmath53 . for practical purposes , however ,",
    "only a few levels are needed , and , starting from the standard action on the lowest level , the fp value is reached soon .",
    "this iterative method can be used to solve the fp  equation numerically .",
    "one can , however , make some important statements even without explicitly solving eq .",
    "( [ fp - equation ] ) . this will be done in the next section .",
    "as in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model we can show the following important statement concerning classical solutions ( e.g. instanton solutions ) .",
    "* statement * : if the coarse configuration @xmath46 satisfies the fp classical equations of motion ( i.e. the classical equations corresponding to @xmath54 ) , and therefore is a local minimum of @xmath55 , then the configuration @xmath56 on the fine lattice , which minimizes the right hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ fp - equation ] ) , satisfies the equations of motion as well .",
    "in addition , the value of the action remains unchanged : @xmath57 .",
    "* proof * : since @xmath46 is a solution of the fp classical equations of motion , it is a stationary point of @xmath51 , and it satisfies @xmath58 .",
    "the transformation kernel is positive : @xmath59 the minimizing configuration @xmath60 must fulfill @xmath61 , otherwise we could find another coarse configuration @xmath46 , that fulfills this equation and lowers therefore the value of @xmath45 ; which would be in contradiction to the assumption , that @xmath46 is a stationary point .",
    "hence we have a ( albeit not unique ) relation between the given coarse field @xmath46 and the minimizing fine field @xmath56 @xmath62 in other words , @xmath26 is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath34 defined in eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "@xmath63 is zero ( that means , at its absolute minimum ) for the minimizing fine field @xmath56 , hence @xmath56 is also a stationary point of @xmath54 and @xmath56 satisfies the classical fp  equations of motion .",
    "furthermore , the value of the action is the same : @xmath64 q.e.d .",
    "note , that the reverse statement is not always true .",
    "if the fine configuration @xmath60 is a solution of the equations of motion , then the coarse configuration obtained from eq .",
    "( [ blocking ] ) is a local minimum , but it need not be the absolute minimum that has to be found at the right - hand side of the fp equation  ( [ fp - equation ] ) .",
    "this mechanism prevents the existence of arbitrarily small instantons on the lattice ( see below ) .    using the above statement",
    ", we can now construct instanton configurations on the lattice ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the corresponding construction in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model ) .",
    "we consider instanton configurations of the continuum on a torus . on a torus",
    ", however , there exists no exact one - instanton configuration @xcite . in order to clearly separate cutoff effects from finite size effects",
    ", we have to fall back upon exact two - instanton configurations .",

    "the vectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath7-component @xmath0 vectors which specify the orientation of the instantons in `` color space '' .",
    "the four complex parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 specify the size of the instantons and their position and orientation on the torus .",
    "we choose them in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the instanton size and @xmath77 the size of the torus .",
    "the action @xmath78 of the configuration  ( [ inst - cont ] ) is equal @xmath79 irrespective of the size @xmath76 of the instantons .",
    "next we want to construct lattice two - instanton configurations of different sizes .",
    "we first discretize the continuum two - instanton configuration on a very fine lattice , so that the cutoff effects can safely be neglected .",
    "then we perform @xmath47 block transformations using eq .",
    "( [ blocking ] ) . under a block transformation",
    "the size of the instantons is halved .",
    "choosing the number @xmath47 of block transformations and the initial size @xmath76 , one can get any final size @xmath80 on a coarse lattice .",
    "the above statement shows , that the action remains the same , unless the size of the instantons is too small , and they fall through the lattice .",
    "we have numerically performed the above program for the @xmath1 model , and have measured several quantities on the finally blocked configurations .",
    "on the coarse configuration itself we measured the geometric charge , the standard action , the symanzik improved action and the parametrization of the fp action presented in sec .",
    "[ paraction ] .",
    "performing a minimization on a multigrid with three finer levels , we measured the exact fp action and on the finest level the fp charge ( cf . sec .",
    "[ chargesection ] ) .",
    "because instantons in @xmath1 are embedded @xmath31 instantons , it is clear , that the results presented in fig .  [ inst ] are practically identical to the ones obtained in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model  @xcite .",
    "the results show , that it is possible to obtain a parametrization of the fp action that performs very well for instanton configurations down to the smallest possible size on the lattice .",
    "in contrast , the standard action and also the symanzik improved action perform quite bad , especially for small instantons .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the range of instanton sizes , where the geometric charge differs from the fp charge , is quite narrow . for instanton configurations",
    ", the geometric charge seems to be as good as the fp charge . for general configurations created in a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ,",
    "however , there is a noticeable difference between the two charges ( cf .",
    "[ mc ] ) .",
    "if we want to use the fp action in practical numerical simulations , we must construct a parametrization , that consists of a not too large set of local operators .",
    "our parametrization has the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the angle between two spins .",
    "note , that in @xmath15 models the maximal angle between two spins is @xmath83 ; @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the same spin , different only by a gauge transformation .",
    "there are two reasons why it is useful to use the angle @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 : for solutions of the equations of motion of the form @xmath88 , the @xmath89 dependence of the action is exactly @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , if one rotates a single spin in a trivial background with all spins pointing in the same direction , the @xmath89 dependence of the action is more like @xmath90 rather than @xmath91 . figure  [ onespin ] shows how well the minimized fp  action is approximated even by the two first terms ( nearest neighbor , diagonal ) of the lowest order of the parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ parametrization ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the standard action performs very bad for large angles .",
    "we can calculate the coefficients @xmath92 of the lowest order analytically .",
    "the coefficients of the higher orders can be determined in a numerical fitting procedure .      the analytic result for the lowest order term in the fp action will be valid for all @xmath7 , as long as @xmath93 .",
    "consider on the coarse level a smooth configuration , which is weakly fluctuating around the first direction @xmath94 where @xmath95 has @xmath96 components , and @xmath97 .",
    "with this choice we have fixed the gauge by imposing , that the first component is real and positive .",
    "then the minimizing fine configuration will also fluctuate around the first direction and , using the same gauge fixing prescription , we make the ansatz @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "putting these expansions and the parametrization of the action  ( [ parametrization ] ) in the fp  equation  ( [ fp - equation ] ) and keeping only terms up to quadratic order in @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we get the equation @xmath102 this equation can be solved for @xmath76 most easily by using the same technique as described in ref .",
    "taking into account the fact , that for the @xmath31 model the rg transformation goes over to the one used for the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model , it is not astonishing , that the resulting @xmath76 is exactly the same as in ref .",
    "consequently , in order to have a most local action , we will also choose the free parameter @xmath103 in the rg transformation eq .",
    "( [ rg - trafo ] ) .      in order to have a reasonably good parametrization of the lattice action which performs well also for coarse configurations ,",
    "we include higher order terms in the parametrization  ( [ parametrization ] ) .",
    "the coefficients of these higher order terms will depend on the chosen model , and are different for each @xmath7 .",
    "we determined them numerically for the @xmath1 model . to do this , we first produced about 300 configurations of lattice size 3 with a monte carlo program using the standard action .",
    "the configurations ranged from ones with small actions and fluctuations with small amplitudes to strongly fluctuating ones .",
    "we also included some two - instanton configurations with radii of the order of one lattice spacing ( cf .",
    "[ instanton ] ) . for every configuration we calculated the value of the fp  action by minimizing the fp  equation on a multigrid .",
    "then we determined the coefficients of 30 higher order operators chosen because of their locality .",
    "their value was determined so that the average difference between minimized and parametrized fp  action was minimal .",
    "figure  [ scatter ] illustrates the quality of the parametrization .",
    "the relative deviation from the minimized fp  action is only large for very coarse configurations with large actions . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the standard action for the same configurations .",
    "note , that here the relative deviation of the standard action from the fp action is not small , even for configurations with small amplitude fluctuations .",
    "the resulting 32 coefficients of the parametrization  ( [ parametrization ] ) are given with a graphical notation of the corresponding operators in table  [ couplings ] .",
    "a line with two dots    ( 22,6)(0,0 ) ( 2,3 ) ( 20,3 ) ( 2,3)(1,0)18    means that the angle @xmath104 between the two spins at positions @xmath105 and @xmath106 of the dots enters into the parametrization .",
    "a graph consisting of several lines represents just the multiplication of the corresponding angles .",
    "coefficients no . 1 and no .",
    "4 are the only analytically calculated ones , all the other couplings were determined by the fitting procedure .",
    "the locality of the action is expressed in the fact , that it is possible to construct a good parametrization with operators consisting of spins , that lie only within a @xmath107 section of the whole lattice . on the other hand",
    ", the parametrization seems to be not as local as the one found in the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath2 model .",
    "some couplings of operators of higher order have quite a large value .",
    "nevertheless , one should not give too much attention to the actual value of the couplings . a large coupling for",
    "a higher order operator does not mean , that the action is less local .",
    "some combinations of couplings can be changed without much affecting the quality of the parametrization . in principle",
    "one would not need to keep all 32 operators in the parametrization , we just did so for reasons of completeness .",
    "using 32 operators for an action in a mc simulation may seem to be a lot .",
    "however , compared with the expected benefit of using such an action , the additional computational effort needed seems to be reasonable .",
    "a feature of @xmath0 models common with gauge field models is the existence of topologically nontrivial solutions . in the continuum theory the topological charge @xmath108",

    "are clearly separated , but on the lattice one may continuously transform a field from one topological sector to another . furthermore , when using the standard lattice action , the scale invariance of instanton solutions is violated . the action decreases with decreasing instanton size , and configurations that violate the inequality  ( [ inequality ] )  so called `` dislocations ''  are possible .    in refs .",

    "we made a minimal @xmath159 fit to the correlation function with the function @xmath160 in the interval @xmath161 $ ] for different @xmath162 .",
    "the value of @xmath163 is taken at an expected plateau at @xmath164 .    in order to avoid finite size effects",
    ", one has to make measurements in large enough volumes .",
    "we made measurements for all @xmath132 values in volumes with the ratio @xmath165 kept approximately constant .",
    "these volumes are usually large enough to totally avoid any finite size effects . in @xmath15 models , however , the basic @xmath84 particles are subject to a confining potential . thus the resulting bound states may have a radius that is larger than the correlation length .",
    "for this reason we also made measurements for some @xmath132 values in even larger volumes ( with ratios @xmath166 up to 12 ) .",
    "the masses that are determined in the `` small '' volume @xmath167 are about @xmath168 below the ones measured in `` infinite '' volume , as can be seen in table  [ mcres ] .",
    "the magnitude of this finite size effect fits nicely with the one observed in refs .",
    "furthermore , we observed , that in the large volumes the determination of the mass gap showed a nice plateau behavior .",
    "such a plateau was sometimes not very clearly seen in the small volumes .",
    "nevertheless , we may use the results obtained in the small volume in order to look for a scaling behavior in @xmath169 .",
    "the actual values are spoiled by finite - size effects , but since @xmath166 is constant , these effects are the same for every point .",
    "we checked asymptotic scaling of the mass gap according to the perturbative lattice scale in two - loop approximation @xmath170 in fig .",
    "[ asymptotic ] we show the ratio @xmath171 versus the correlation length , with masses determined in `` small '' volumes @xmath172 and also some measurements in `` large '' volumes .",
    "the most striking observation is that the ratio approaches a constant value @xmath173 ( this value is obtained in `` large '' volumes ) , and that its final value is attained already at a quite short correlation length .",
    "such a precocious asymptotic scaling has not been stated for other lattice actions . with the standard action , for example , one does not even see an asymptotic scaling at correlation lengths @xmath174  @xcite .",
    "note that the asymptotic scaling behavior for the fp action is a purely phenomenological observation that has not been expected theoretically .",
    "the fp action was constructed nonperturbatively in order to reduce cutoff effects . that the mass gap scales with the perturbative @xmath150 parameter is just an additional , unexpected benefit .",
    "we furthermore observe , that the value of the ratio @xmath171 is remarkably small . from this",
    "we conclude , that @xmath175 is much closer to the continuum scale than @xmath176 .",
    "we determined the topological charge , using both the geometric definition and the definition of the fp charge given in sec .",
    "[ chargesection ] . for the measurement of the fp charge we used the geometric charge on a finer lattice of the multigrid with the monte carlo generated lattice as coarsest level .",
    "in order to determine the configuration @xmath177 on the first finer level , one can either minimize the fp  equation ( which is very time consuming ) or use the parametrization of the dependence on @xmath119 , given in sec .",
    "[ fpfield ] .",
    "we denote the corresponding charges @xmath178 for the geometric charge and , e.g. , @xmath179 for the charge measured on the first finer level using the parametrization of the fine field .    for some @xmath132 values",
    "we compared the results of using the parametrization on a finer level and of minimizing on a multigrid .",
    "the results were found to be consistent within the statistical errors , as is reported in table  [ mcres ] .",
    "this shows that the parametrization performs well for typical configurations occurring in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we wanted to be sure , that it is sufficient to measure the charge only on the first finer level .",
    "as a test we calculated for one @xmath132 value also the charge on the second finer level .",
    "the result presented in table  [ mcres ] shows , that the values on the first and the second finer level were found to be consistent within the statistical errors .",
    "this means that the process of going to a lower level is already stable at that stage , and that it is sufficient to calculate the fine field only on the first finer level .",
    "this is not unexpected , since we use a geometric definition of the topological charge at a lower level .",
    "therefore , we always get an integer number for the charge , and the charge has to change abruptly when going to a finer level .",
    "the field on the first finer level is then ( in most cases ) smooth enough to yield already the fp topological charge .",
    "table  [ mcres ] shows the effect of using different definitions of the lattice topological charge . on the coarse level",
    "the value of @xmath180 is higher than the one obtained with the fp charge ( on the first finer level ) .",
    "this can be explained with dislocations which contribute to the geometric charge .",
    "they have the effect that one overestimates the amount of topological excitation .    in fig .",
    "[ suscresults ] we show the results of the scaling test for the dimensionless quantity @xmath169 , measured in volumes with a ratio @xmath181 .",
    "one clearly sees the expected raise at small correlation lengths , which is due to lost small instantons in this region . at correlation length @xmath182",
    "this effect is already saturated .",
    "the measurements in `` small '' volumes using the fp charge ( i.e. , @xmath179 ) show the expected scaling plateau at a value of about @xmath183 ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ suscresults ] ) .",
    "the measurements using the geometric definition of the topological charge give somewhat larger values but they seem to converge to the value obtained from the fp topological charge for larger correlation lengths  these measurements do not show the same nice scaling behavior as the measurements using the fp charge .",
    "this is also what is to be expected in the @xmath1 model if dislocations contribute to the geometric charge . in the continuum limit",
    "the effect of these dislocations is suppressed , but they still contribute at the considered correlation lengths .",
    "we can now use the four measurements in `` large '' volumes , with @xmath184 for the topological charge and perform a fit to the data with eq .",
    "( [ dilute ] ) , in order to extrapolate to the continuum value .",
    "we obtain the value @xmath185 .",
    "let us compare our numerical value with previous determinations and with results from the large @xmath7 expansion  @xcite . to leading order in @xmath186 one",
    "gets @xmath187 this value is comparable with the value we got at the scaling plateau .",
    "however , the correction to the leading order is large in eq .",
    "( [ largen ] ) and the agreement with numerical results occurs at chance at @xmath188 .",
    "the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( who use actions with an explicit gauge field )  quoting @xmath189 with an uncertainty of @xmath190  are in quite good correspondence with our result .",
    "measurements using the standard action and the geometric definition of the topological charge ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) lead to a value roughly twice as large as ours , but with large scaling violations at large correlation lengths  this is probably the effect of dislocations which still contribute at the considered correlation lengths .",
    "in @xmath0 models it is possible to define a fp action and a fp topological charge . the fp action is the fixed point of an exact rg transformation .",
    "it is a classically perfect action and possesses scale invariant instanton solutions .",
    "the definition of the fp topological charge is based on the fp field operator .",
    "both , the fp action and the fp field can be evaluated to any precision desired on a sufficiently large multigrid .",
    "it can be shown that the fp topological charge together with the fp action have no lattice defects .",
    "it is profitable to use the fp action and the fp topological charge in numerical simulations . for this purpose ,",
    "we have parametrized for the @xmath191 model the fp action and the field solution of the fp equation which is iterated to obtain the fp field .",
    "we used these parametrizations in mc simulations of the @xmath1 model .",
    "we find two main results .",
    "first , the mass gap unexpectedly scales according to the perturbative lattice scale .",
    "second , the dimensionless quantity @xmath169 raises as expected at small correlation lengths , and reaches a scaling plateau at @xmath192 .",
