    "infrared spectroscopy has in the past several decades become one of the premier experimental tools in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "thanks to its versatility , it has been successfully applied to essentially all types of condensed matter systems , such as superconductors , topological insulators , graphene , etc . in particular , in high - t@xmath0 cuprate superconductors , infrared based techniques have been extensively used to probe a variety of unusual and yet unresolved issues concerning their unconventional pairing state @xcite . in recent years",

    "in this section we present the details of our procedure .",
    "the approach is based on the kramers - kronig transformation of optical conductivity , which we introduced previously to extract the superfluid density from infrared data @xcite . in the superconducting state the real part of optical conductivity",

    "the existence of this quasiparticle peak is usually ignored during analysis of infrared data , as it does not contain a lot of spectral weight and does not significantly affect the calculation of normal state plasma frequency ( eq .  [ eq : plasma ] ) .",
    "however , this narrow peak can produce a significant 1/@xmath8 contribution to @xmath20 , which mimics the superfluid response .",
    "if we want to calculate the london penetration depth or the superfluid stiffness , it must be separated from the superconducting contribution .",
    "we show below that in the case of optimally doped bi2212 this can lead to correction of superconducting plasma frequency @xmath27 by as much as 40  @xmath45 .    in order to perform the integration in eq .",

    "we expect the method described here to be a useful tool for infrared spectroscopy , which will allow quasiparticle properties to be studied for the first time in the superconducting state .",
    "in particular , there are several issues in the cuprates that can be immediately addressed using this new procedure . scaling analysis @xcite",
    "can now be extended below t@xmath0 , and the question of fermi vs non - fermi liquid quasiparticles can be studied .",
