    "delay - differential equations ( ddes ) have been used as mathematical models for phenomena in population dynamics  @xcite , physiology  @xcite , physics  @xcite , climate modelling  @xcite and engineering  @xcite amongst others .",
    "delay - differential equations behave like abstract ordinary differential equations ( odes ) on an infinite - dimensional ( banach ) phase space and many results which are known for odes on finite - dimensional spaces have analogs in the context of ddes .",
    "many scalar delay - differential equation models have been developed over the years such as for cheynes - stokes respiration  @xcite and the regulation of hematopoiesis  @xcite , the delayed nicholson blowflies equation  @xcite in population dynamics , a two - delay model of an experiment on parkinsonian tremor  @xcite and many more .",
    "the bifurcation analysis of ddes is done essentially in the same way as in odes , although the technical details differ .",
    "consider the neighborhood of an equilibrium solution of a nonlinear dde , then the analysis of the linearization at the equilibrium point leads to stable , unstable and centre invariant subspaces where only the stable subspace is infinite - dimensional .",
    "there exists local invariant manifolds ( stable , unstable and center manifolds ) tangent to the corresponding invariant subspaces of the linearized equations about the equilibrium point on which the flow near the equilibrium is either exponentially attracting ( stable manifold ) , exponentially repelling ( unstable manifold ) , or non - hyperbolic ( center manifold ) .",
    "now , bifurcations near equilibria are determined by the flow on the centre manifold and the dimension of this manifold is determined by the number of eigenvalues of the linearization on the imaginary axis .",
    "the first result of our paper is theorem  [ thm : main ] and goes as follows .",
    "consider @xmath3 nonzero imaginary numbers @xmath4 where the imaginary parts @xmath5 are positive and not rationally dependent .",
    "we show that there exists a scalar linear delay - differential equation depending on @xmath3 discrete delays written @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 $ ] for all @xmath10 such that the characteristic equation of  ( [ linear - eq1]),given by @xmath11 has eigenvalues @xmath12 .",
    "this result generalizes explicit computations done in the case of one and two delays , see  @xcite .",
    "the proof is done by embedding the problem as a mapping which is solved by the implicit function theorem at a carefully chosen point . from the implicit function theorem , we are able to define a smooth mapping whose transversal intersection with a dense curve on an @xmath3-dimensional torus provide solutions .",
    "the incommensurability of the @xmath3 frequencies enables us to define the dense curve on the @xmath3-torus .",
    "this type of argument using a dense curve on an @xmath3-dimensional torus was used in choi and leblanc  @xcite .",
    "this result falls within the category of so - called realization theorems .",
    "for instance , the realization theorem of linear odes by linear ddes obtained by faria and magalh@xmath13es  @xcite .",
    "they show that for any finite dimensional matrix @xmath14 , a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a bounded linear operator @xmath15 from @xmath16,{\\mathbb r}^{n})$ ] into @xmath17 with infinitesimal generator having spectrum containing the spectrum of @xmath14 is that @xmath3 be larger than or equal to the largest number of jordan blocks associated with each eigenvalue of @xmath14 .",
    "other results in this direction are concerned with the realization of finite jets of odes on a finite - dimensional centre manifold by delay - differential equations , see  @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the realization theorems in this paper are the first general results linking the number of critical eigenvalues of linear delay - differential equations with the number of discrete delays .",
    "the next significant result is an openness theorem , that is , the realization of @xmath3 imaginary numbers ( not necessarily rationally independent ) as eigenvalues of a linear scalar delay - differential equation is valid in a neighborhood of any set of @xmath3 rationally independent imaginary numbers .",
    "the proof of this theorem also relies on the implicit function theorem .",
    "we then turn our attention to the context of symmetric systems of delay - differential equations .",
    "several examples of symmetric systems of ddes  @xcite have characteristic equations which decompose in factors , some of which have the same form as the characteristic equation  ( [ char - eq ] ) .",
    "the decomposition of the characteristic equation is induced by the isotypic decomposition of the space and we present a general derivation of this decomposition .",
    "we show that isotypic components consisting of a unique one - dimensional complex irreducible representation contribute a factor of the form  ( [ char - eq ] ) in the characteristic equation and so theorem  [ thm : main ] can be applied directly to each such factors separately .",
    "we present a generalization of theorem  [ thm : main ] to the case where several factors of the characteristic equation have purely imaginary eigenvalues simultaneously .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main2 ] shows that a set of @xmath3 rationally independent purely imaginary complex numbers can be realized from several factors of the characteristic equation of a delay - differential equation with @xmath3 delays given some nondegeneracy conditions on the characteristic equation are satisfied .",
    "the statement of the theorem is independent of any symmetric structure and the proof is a generalization of the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "we illustrate the above result on @xmath2-symmetric rings of @xmath3 delay equations with delayed coupling .",
    "hopf bifurcation from such symmetric networks have been studied by several authors  @xcite . in order to apply theorem  [ thm : main2 ] to this context",
    ", we derive an explicit form of the coupling matrix in terms of the connections in the graph representation of the ring for cells of any dimension and arbitrary numbers of connections and delays .",
    "this is a generalization of the networks considered in the articles listed above in this paragraph .",
    "we specialize to the case of one - dimensional cells and we can then obtain general formulae for the factors of the form  ( [ char - eq ] ) in the characteristic equation of the @xmath2-symmetric ring . given a nondegeneracy assumption of theorem  [ thm : main2 ] is satisfied , then it can be applied directly to @xmath2 symmetric coupled cell systems with @xmath3 odd .",
    "we do not treat the case @xmath3 even because the form of the equations needed for theorem  [ thm : main2 ] is not satisfied .",
    "we illustrate this fact in a @xmath18-symmetric example .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section contains brief preliminary remarks and then we state and prove our main result ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) and the openness result ( theorem  [ thm : open ] ) .",
    "then we introduce the context leading to theorem  [ thm : main2 ] and state this result .",
    "section  [ sec : symmetry ] is devoted to @xmath19-symmetric systems of delay - differential equations and the section begins with a general discussion .",
    "section  [ section : delay - ring ] presents a characterization of @xmath2-symmetric rings of delay coupled cells with an arbitrary number of delays and derive the characteristic equation in the case of one - dimensional cells . in section  [ section : critical - dn ] ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : main2 ] is applied to @xmath2-symmetric rings of one - dimensional cells with @xmath3 odd .",
    "section  [ sec : main - proof ] has the proof of theorem  [ thm : main2 ] .",
    "we conclude by a discussion of open problems along the lines of the ones presented in this paper .",
    "we now discuss some aspects of the spectral theory of linear scalar delay - differential equations .",

    "there are several ways of extending the main result of our paper .",
    "one question we did not address in this paper is if @xmath3 nonresonant nonzero imaginary eigenvalues constitutes an upper bound for the realizability by a scalar equation with @xmath3 delay .",

    "one may want to study whether @xmath0 zero eigenvalues in a single jordan block and @xmath496 nonresonant nonzero imaginary eigenvalues can be realized in a scalar delay - differential equation with @xmath581 delays . this problem may be feasible by modifying the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] since the nonresonance of the @xmath496 eigenvalues is again present .",
    "however , we expect the argument used in this paper to breakdown for @xmath3 nonzero imaginary eigenvalues with resonance .",
    "we can also study the same problem as in this paper but for higher dimensional delay equations .",
    "one problem would be to find out if @xmath3 nonresonant nonzero",
    "imaginary eigenvalues can be realized by a @xmath582 dimensional system with @xmath0 delays .",
    "for instance , it is known that a pair of nonzero imaginary eigenvalues can be realized by a two - dimensional equation with one delay  @xcite . in this case @xmath583 and so @xmath584 ; is it possible to realize three nonresonant nonzero eigenvalues or does the relationship @xmath584 provide a bound to realizability in general ?",
    "another problem which can be studied is whether a restriction in the class of delay equation can change the realizability .",
    "for instance , the characteristic equation for a general two - dimensional system with one - delay @xmath585 is @xmath586 while for a second - order equation with one delay in the feedback term we must set @xmath587 .",
    "we know in this case that two nonresonant nonzero imaginary eigenvalues can be realized by a second - order equation with a unique delay in the feedback term  @xcite .",
    "in fact , two imaginary eigenvalues with @xmath588 resonance has been found in such an equation  @xcite .",
    "the obvious question is to see if @xmath3 nonresonant ( and resonant ) nonzero imaginary eigenvalues can be realized within the class of @xmath448 order scalar equations with one delay in the feedback term .",
    "an extension of our main result in a direction relevant for studying bifurcations is to find out whether the @xmath3 nonresonant nonzero imaginary eigenvalues can be realized by a scalar delay equation such that the remaining eigenvalues have negative real parts ; that is , the multiple hopf point lies at the boundary of the stability region for the equilibrium solution .",
    "finally , let us mention the case of linear @xmath46-periodic equations with @xmath589 delays : @xmath590 where each @xmath591 is a @xmath46-periodic @xmath48 matrix .",
    "hale  @xcite states the following open problem :          this problem is automatically solved by theorem  [ thm : main ] if a floquet theorem can be applied to  ( [ linear - periodic ] ) ; that is , the floquet exponents of the floquet multipliers of equation  ( [ linear - periodic ] ) are eigenvalues of a scalar equation  ( [ linear - eq1 ] ) with @xmath589 delays .",
