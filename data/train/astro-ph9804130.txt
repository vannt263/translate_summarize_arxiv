    "it has been known for almost three decades that rotation curves of galaxies remain flat even beyond the visible matter ( rubin & ford @xcite , rubin et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as an explanation , ostriker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and einasto et al . ( @xcite ) suggested that galaxies are surrounded by large halos consisting of `` dark matter '' and dominating the total mass of the galaxies . over the years a very large number of possible `` candidates '' for this dark matter have been suggested ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , bahcall @xcite or raffelt @xcite ) .",
    "they can broadly be divided into `` elementary particle '' candidates ( e.g. massive neutrinos or axions ) and `` astrophysical '' candidates ( e.g. black holes , brown dwarfs , `` jupiters '' , comets ) .",
    "not much progress has been made to date in identifying the elusive dark matter despite major efforts in many directions .",
    "in fact , a new branch of physics established itself ",
    "`` astro - particle physics ''  whose major goal is the solution of the dark matter problem .",
    "more than 10 years ago paczyski ( @xcite ) proposed a direct test to prove or reject the possibility that the halo of the milky way consists of dark compact objects by way of gravitational microlensing : if the brightness of at least a million stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) could be regularly observed , at any given time about one of them should be magnified due to a halo object ( in the following referred to as `` macho '' , for `` massive compact halo object '' ) passing in front of it and focussing the light rays to the observer .",
    "the light curve of the affected background star should show a very characteristic and achromatic behaviour .",
    "soon thereafter various groups started big observational programs to investigate this promising possibility , and the first microlensing events were found in 1993 ( alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ; aubourg et al .",
    "the most recent results indicate that about @xmath6 of the dark matter in the milky way halo can consist of such objects ( alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ) . their most likely mass range ( @xmath7 m@xmath8 ) , however , is higher than originally suggested for genuine `` brown dwarfs '' , but the uncertainty is large .",
    "the largest problem in these experiments is the small probability for a microlensing event : the `` optical depth '' ( the fraction of background stars that are significantly affected by microlensing ) is less than @xmath9 .    in a very different optical depth regime , gravitational lensing",
    "can also be used to test whether halos of _ other _ galaxies are made of compact objects ( gott @xcite ) : in cases of good projected alignment along the line of sight between a background quasar and a foreground galaxy , the galaxy can produce multiple images of the quasar . in this case",
    "the light bundles from the quasar pass through ( the dark halo of ) the foreground galaxy on their way to the observer .",
    "these light bundles probe the graininess of the halo : if the dark matter there consists of some kind of elementary particles ( `` smoothly distributed matter '' on astronomical length scales ) , the light bundles should be unaffected ; if it is made of compact astrophysical objects , the light bundles can probe it .",
    "the measured brightnesses of the quasar images should vary as a function of time due to the changing relative positions between lens , source and observer ( chang & refsdal @xcite ) .",
    "the surface mass density ( optical depth ) in these cases is high enough ( of order unity ) to basically affect ( change ) the measured flux of a quasar image all the time .    since quasars are intrinsically variable as well , it is not trivial to decide whether an observed variability is intrinsic or microlensing - induced . in the case of multiple images of one quasar ,",
    "however , the intrinsic fluctuations should show up coherently in all the images ",
    "modulo a certain time delay  whereas the microlensing changes occur uncorrelated in the various images .",
    "once well - sampled light curves of two ( or more ) quasar images are obtained and the time delay @xmath10 ( due to the different light paths of different light bundles ) and the magnitude difference @xmath11 ( due to different magnifications ) is known ( both of which are not trivial ) , one can shift the two light curves in time and magnitude by the appropriate amounts @xmath10 and @xmath11 and subtract them from each other .",
    "all remaining fluctuations in the `` difference light curve '' must be due to microlensing .",
    "in particular , if the difference light curve is flat , this indicates that there was no microlensing going on during the period of observation .",
    "the gravitationally lensed double quasar q0957 + 561 ( walsh et al .",
    "@xcite ) has been observed / monitored for almost two decades by many groups ( see e.g. , schild & thomson @xcite ) with the goal to measure the time delay and subsequently determine the hubble constant .",
    "the time delay is now established firmly at @xmath12 days ( schild & thomson @xcite ; kundi et al .",
    "@xcite , subsequently k97 ; oscoz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", a number of gravitational lens models have been published for the q0957 + 561 system which reproduce the observed ( optical and radio ) image configurations well ( falco et al .",
    "@xcite ; grogin & narayan @xcite ) , so that the parameters relevant for microlensing at the position of the quasar images can be determined from these models with an accuracy of a few percent .    with both",
    "the time delay established and good models being available , the double quasar q0957 + 561 can hence be used as a test for massive halo objects by comparison of the light curves of images a and b. we do this here by simulating the microlensing effect numerically for machos of different masses .",
    "we analyse the resulting microlensed light curves and show how often microlensing - induced changes of certain amplitudes are to be expected for certain macho masses .",
    "finally , we compare our numerical simulations with the well - sampled data set of k97 and thus constrain the macho masses in ( the halo of ) the lensing galaxy .    in sect .",
    "2 we describe briefly the monitoring data set of k97 for the double quasar and the simulations we perform in order to compare the observations with microlensing light curves due to different masses . in sect .",
    "3 we show our results for a macho mass range from @xmath13 , and in the final sect .",
    "4 we present our conclusions .",
    "we first briefly present the macro model of the lens system and the recent data set on the quasar q0957 + 561 which we use .",
    "we then define the relevant numbers and parameters and illustrate how the microlensing light curve depends on the macho masses and the quasar size .",
    "finally , the numerical technique is described which we employ to produce the microlensing light curves and to analyse them .",
    "the double quasar q0957 + 561 ( @xmath14 ) is gravitationally lensed by a galaxy ( @xmath15 ) and its associated galaxy cluster . the complex structure of the quasar in the radio regime places strong constraints on theoretical models ( e.g. gorenstein et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so that well determined values for the surface mass density and the local shear at the positions of the quasar images can be obtained ( falco et al .",
    "@xcite , priv .",
    "grogin & narayan @xcite ) .    the normalized surface mass density @xmath16 is the projected mass density of the lensing galaxy plus cluster along the line of sight , normalized by the critical surface mass density ( schneider et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath17 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the angular diameter distances between observer , deflector and source , respectively ( the velocity of light is denoted by @xmath21 and the gravitational constant by @xmath22 ) .",
    "the underlying cosmological model is an einstein de - sitter universe with a hubble constant of h@xmath23km@xmath24s@xmath25mpc@xmath25 .",
    "the local shear @xmath26 represents the tidal field at the image position due to the matter outside the beam .",
    "we adopt values for the surface density of @xmath27 for image a and @xmath28 for image b , for the local shear at the image positions we used @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ( falco priv . comm . ) .",
    "recently , k97 presented the results of two years of well sampled monitoring observations of q0957 + 561 with the apache point observatory . with their @xmath31 band data",
    ", they confirmed the value of @xmath32 days for the time delay @xmath10 between the two lensed light paths and a best value for the magnitude offset between the ( time - corrected ) quasar fluxes of @xmath33    in order to quantitatively estimate the effects or limits of microlensing on the light curves of q0957 + 561 a and/or b , we determined the difference light curve between the two quasar images in the following way .",
    "first , the flux - corrected and time shifted light curve of image b ( i.e. : @xmath34 ) was subtracted from the light curve of image a : @xmath35 which measures the deviation between the two light curves .",
    "since the light curve had been sampled only for discrete points in time , we had to interpolate between the two closest points of light curve b before and after the instant of time in which a point of light curve a had been determined ( or vice versa ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; @xmath40 indicates the time at which data was taken for image a , and @xmath41 are the closest times before and after @xmath42 for which data exists for image b. the `` difference light curve '' is defined as : @xmath43 the measurement uncertainties @xmath44 were added quadratically for each combined pair of data during interpolation and subtraction .",
    "the resulting difference light curve is shown in fig .",
    "we also determined the difference light curve by interpolating the a - light curve ( rather than b ) and obtained a very similar result .",
    "we used 36 observations of image a and 40 observations of image b out of the 99 available observations from the years 1995 and 1996 ( k97 ) since we had to restrict ourselves to the about 160 days of `` overlap '' between the image a light curve and the time - shifted image b light curve .",
    "the time axis in fig .",
    "[ diff ] corresponds to the observing epoch of image a.    we detect no variation in the difference light curve with an amplitude greater than @xmath45 mag . and considering the error bars we find that the difference light curve would even be consistent with @xmath46 mag . there is also no systematic gradient apparent in the data , which would be the signature of a long term microlensing event , produced by a relatively massive macho .",
    "the small variance can be quantified .",
    "we determine a @xmath47 between the difference light curve and a horizontal line ( i.e. the hypothesis : no detectable microlensing - induced changes within the measurement uncertainties ) defined by : @xmath48 n is the number of data points of the difference light curve .",
    "this @xmath47-value measures the goodness of representing the data with @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 or @xmath51 , depending on which of the two light curve sets was interpolated ( see above ) .",
    "this means there is no statistically significant deviation between the light curves of the two images .    however , in the difference light curve in fig .",
    "[ diff ] there is a small peak seen around day 750 ( k97 ) .",
    "we tried in many ways to establish the significance of these half dozen or so points which are slightly but coherently above the `` zero''-line .",
    "interestingly , if one goes back to the original individual light curves by k97 , it can be seen that at the julian date corresponding to the peak in light curve of image a , a similar peak was seen in the light curve of image b. this could indicate a systematic effect during the observation .",
    "nevertheless , this `` peak '' in the difference light curve seems to have been seen by schild ( @xcite ) as well with independent data taken at a different observatory .",
    "if real , such a peak in the difference light curve could be interpreted as a short - duration , small - amplitude microlensing event in image a. in that case it could provide valuable information on the mass of possible microlensing objects in the halo of the lensing galaxy . since we can not prove with our data",
    "that this peak is real ( rather than a statistical fluke ) , in this paper we will argue more conservatively that we do not detect any microlensing changes @xmath52 higher than @xmath53 mag ; we will use this argument to put limits on the masses of the machos in the halo of the lensing galaxy .",
    "this leaves open both the possibility that this possible event is a fluke or that it is real .",
    "if the latter turns out to be true , one can even draw some stronger quantitative conclusions on the masses of possible machos , rather than just exclude certain regions in parameter space .",
    "the exact shape of a microlensed quasar light curve depends on    * the direction of the ( projected ) relative velocity vector between lens and source * the ( projected ) relative positions of the machos * the masses of the machos and * the size of the continuum emitting region of the quasar .",
    "we do not and can not know the exact positions of the machos . hence we will not be able to predict or explain an individual microlensed quasar light curve ( in contrast to the `` low optical depth '' regime of microlensing of stars in the milky way or magellanic clouds ) .",
    "however , we can determine and analyse microlensed light curves in a statistical sense ; in particular , we investigate here the distribution of total magnification variations .",
    "we first determine the two - dimensional magnification variations due to microlensing at different positions in the source plane with the ray - shooting technique ; we follow light rays backwards through an arrangement of machos randomly distributed in the plane of the lensing galaxy , with surface mass density and shear as given by the lensing model by falco et al .",
    "( @xcite , priv . comm . ) ( see sect .",
    "[ lensmodanddata ] ) .",
    "the density of the deflected light rays in the quasar plane corresponds to the relative magnification as a function of position ( wambsganss @xcite ) . in these simulations ,",
    "we always use machos with identical masses .",
    "we follow approximately of @xmath54 light rays and collect them in the source plane in an array of 2500 by 2500 pixels .",
    "we simulate microlensing light curves in the standard way ( see , e.g. , kayser @xcite or wambsganss @xcite ) by evaluating the magnification along linear tracks across the magnification patterns with a physical length l , equal to the length the quasar traverses in the 160 day time span of the observed difference light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ diff ] . by assuming a projected quasar velocity relative to the magnification pattern of @xmath55 kms@xmath25 ( calculated using the method by witt & mao @xcite )",
    ", this length is given by @xmath56 we have neglected any motion of the machos relative to each other ( kundi & wambsganss @xcite and wambsganss & kundi @xcite ) . since velocities of stars in galaxies are in general smaller than galaxy velocities , this effect can not dominate the bulk velocities .",
    "it merely slightly increases the value of the transverse velocity of the quasar .",
    "we calculated magnification patterns for both quasar images with fractions of the halo mass contained in compact objects of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for each of these mass fractions we produced magnification patterns of varying physical side lengths of 20 , 200 and 2000 einstein radii .",
    "the einstein radius in the source plane is defined as ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath60 from this expression one can see that a single magnification pattern can be used to simulate light curves for various macho masses because the physical length scales with the square root of the mass of the machos .",
    "if the surface mass density is kept constant in the lens plane , this corresponds to blowing up the length scale of the distribution of machos by a factor  @xmath61 . since the deflection angle is proportional to the mass and inversely proportional to the distance to the lens ,",
    "the magnification pattern in the source plane is thus also blown up by the same factor of  @xmath61 . ]",
    "; the fixed length the quasar traverses in the source plane translates into different numbers of pixels for different macho masses and pattern sizes .",
    "the only limitation we have for the investigation of various microlensing masses is the dynamic range of the magnification pattern , which in our case is an array of 2500 by 2500 pixels .",
    "we used track lengths ranging from 10 pixels to 300 pixels , so that we could simulate three decades of macho masses with one pattern . with the three different side lengths , however , we were able to investigate the effects of macho masses @xmath62 ranging from @xmath63 up to @xmath64 ( in steps of factor 10 ) . due to the `` overlap '' we could check some masses on magnification patterns with different side lengths and hence cross - check the results .",
    "it follows from these considerations that the quasar traverses more ( fewer ) characteristic lengths of the magnification pattern for smaller ( larger ) macho masses during the observation period of 160 days .",
    "this implies that the light curve is more ( less ) variable for smaller ( larger ) macho masses , so that one can derive limits on the macho masses from the microlensing variability .",
    "this is illustrated for three different mass scales in fig .",
    "[ variability ] ; the variability of the microlensing light curves increases strongly with decreasing macho mass .",
    "qualitatively one can take from the magnification patterns in fig .",
    "[ variability ] that the probability of observing no microlensing variation is practically zero for @xmath65 machos ( bottom panel ) whereas for the @xmath66 machos ( top panel ) this is not unlikely .",
    "these qualitative statements will be quantified in the next section .",
    "the size of the optical continuum region of the quasar , which we call quasar size in the following , has an impact on the shape of a light curve . for extended objects",
    "the total magnification can be calculated as a weighted mean of the magnifications at many points in the source plane . in practice",
    "the effect of the source size can be accounted for by convolving the two - dimensional magnification pattern with an appropriate source profile .",
    "sharp features in the magnification pattern  especially the line - like caustics  are thus smoothed out by the brightness profile of the quasar .",
    "the amplitude ( smaller for large sources ) and the duration ( longer for large sources ) of variations in a microlensing light curve hence depend on the source size ( see wambsganss & paczyski @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted a gaussian profile for the surface brightness profile of the quasar , where the source size is defined by the gaussian width @xmath67 .",
    "we used quasar source sizes ranging from @xmath68 cm up to @xmath69 cm ( in steps of @xmath70 ) .",
    "these quasar sizes are smaller than or of the order of one light day , which is an upper limit on the quasar size that was obtained by wambsganss et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and also witt & mao ( @xcite ) for the quasar q2237 + 0305 .",
    "the case for even larger quasar sizes and smaller macho masses was examined by refsdal & stabell ( @xcite,@xcite ) and haugan ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that all our results for the macho masses and quasar sizes may be scaled with @xmath71 kms@xmath25 for various values @xmath72 of the transverse source velocity .",
    "macho masses scale quadratically with @xmath73 because the scale of the magnification pattern is proportional to the square root of the macho masses",
    ". similarly , the source sizes scale linearly with @xmath73 .",
    "for each set of the two parameters macho mass and quasar size and for each of the two quasar images a and b , we analysed 100000 randomly chosen tracks across the magnification patterns .",
    "the same tracks were used for different source sizes . for each light curve",
    "we determined the difference between the highest and the lowest point of the light curve @xmath74 .",
    "we call this quantity the total magnitude variation of the light curve .    with these light curves",
    ", we can calculate the probability @xmath75 of observing a total variation greater than or equal to some value @xmath76 for each analysed parameter pair of macho mass and quasar size . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ distrib ] two integrated probability distributions @xmath75 are shown for machos of mass @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in these plots",
    "it is assumed that the quasar has a size of @xmath79 cm and that the halo mass is completely made up of machos .",
    "three lines are shown per plot ; the distributions for images a and b alone , as well as the joint probability distribution where at least one quasar image has a total variation greater than @xmath76 .",
    "one can see that much stronger microlensing variations are expected for small macho masses than for large masses on these short time scales .    in the following , @xmath75 refers only to the joint probability where the microlensing variation is observed in at least one quasar image .    in order to compare the simulations with the observations , we calculated the joint probability @xmath80 for a grid of points in our parameter space of macho masses and quasar sizes .",

    "the reason is that the size of the light curve becomes comparable to the whole field size and hence the light curves are not strictly independent of each other . in order to get statistically reliable results , one should use the @xmath80 that was derived from the largest magnification pattern ( in terms of side lengths in units of einstein radii ) that can be used to generate the light curve sample in question .",
    "incidentally , we find this way that some of the caustic patterns show coherent structures on scales as large as 200 einstein radii .",
    "in two years of observational data on the gravitationally lensed double quasar q0957 + 561 by kundi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) no microlensing variation of the quasar larger than @xmath53 magnitudes was observed . in our microlensing simulations",
    "we find that this rules out a dominant population of compact objects in the halo of the lensing galaxy from @xmath95 down to @xmath96 for quasar sizes below @xmath97 .",
    "these limits are almost independent of the fractions of the halo mass contained in compact objects",
    ".    these results are consistent with the 2nd year results from the macho microlensing search towards the magellanic clouds ( alcock et al .",
    "the most probable mass of machos in the milky way that emerges from their study lies around half a solar mass , which is not excluded by our study .",
    "in fact , such large masses are not yet probed by the observational data set we used ( k97 ) because microlensing effects by objects with masses of about one solar mass are only becoming observable on time - scales of several years . in a different data set on q0957 + 561 ( schild @xcite ) there were indications for some microlensing action which can be produced by stars in this mass range .",
    "very recently , pelt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) analysed a large data set on q0957 + 561 .",
    "similar to us , they can not find evidence for microlensing variations on short time scales .    along the same lines , our results are consistent with the results of lewis & irwin ( @xcite ) who found macho masses to be in the range from @xmath98 up to @xmath99 @xmath82 from microlensing in the quasar q2237 + 0305 .",
    "the limits on compact objects in the halo of the lensing galaxy of q0957 + 561 will , however , improve with time since the monitoring of q0957 + 561 at the apache point observatory ( and also at other observatories ) is an ongoing project .",
    "if , for example , microlensing variations above @xmath53 magnitudes are not observed for another season , the limits from tables  [ macho1 ] , [ macho2 ] and  [ macho3 ] would become stronger and we could possibly rule out compact objects with masses as high as @xmath98 or more .    in quasar microlensing , not only the mass of machos , but also the size of the quasar enters the calculations . with the current data ,",
    "however , we can not constrain the quasar size very much . to do this , one would need to find characteristic events in the difference light curve of the two quasar images .",
    "if , for example , the peak in the difference light curve ( schild @xcite , k97 ) in fig .  [ diff ] around day 750 is real , it would certainly be a valuable constraint for both the masses of machos and the quasar size .",
    "finally , in magnification patterns with side lengths of several hundred einstein radii we find coherent structures in the caustic network on scales of 200 einstein radii or more . in the lensing galaxy of q0957 + 561 these scales",
    "correspond to physical scales of the order of @xmath100pc for machos of mass @xmath62 . on these scales the dark objects",
    "might not be distributed completely randomly anymore .",
    "it would thus be interesting to investigate further the effect of clustering of machos on the microlensing properties of galaxies .",
