    "the solution of the zero - field eight - vertex model by baxter is a landmark in the theory of exactly solvable systems .",
    "the seminal papers @xcite present a variety of algebraic and analytic tools to compute the partition function , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its transfer matrix .",
    "the model is still under active study : in particular , fabricius and mccoy showed that at the so - called root - of - unity points the spectrum of the transfer matrix possesses degeneracies not easily explained by its standard integrability alone @xcite .",
    "it is natural to attribute them to the presence of extended symmetries , possibly elliptic generalisations of the @xmath2-loop - algebra symmetries discovered for the six - vertex model @xcite .",
    "the topic of this paper is the eight - vertex model at a particular root - of - unity point with an extended symmetry .",
    "we utilise the quantum xyz spin chain , whose hamiltonian commutes with the eight - vertex model transfer matrix @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we study the hamiltonian    @xmath3    with periodic boundary conditions along the special line of couplings @xmath4 [ eqn : xyzham ]    while it was already noticed in baxter s original works that along the line of couplings the ground state energy per site remains zero in the thermodynamic limit , its finite - size ground state was addressed much more recently . in @xcite stroganov",
    "argued that possesses exactly two zero - energy ground states for @xmath5 odd . when @xmath6 ( so that @xmath7 ) , the resulting critical xxz chain has been extensively studied over the past decade @xcite .",
    "the components of the ground state in the basis with @xmath8 diagonal possess some remarkable properties .",
    "they display a variety of relations with combinatorial quantities , such as the enumeration of alternating sign matrices and plane partitions .",
    "many of the early conjectures , such as sum rules for the components , were then proved with the help of techniques such as the qkz equations , and combinatorial tools @xcite .",
    "the fact that the ground state energy is exactly zero in the xxz chain at @xmath9 for a finite odd number of sites was proved by exploiting a hidden supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "a ground - state energy of exactly zero is a common characteristic of theories with supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "while quite a number of lattice models possess scaling limits described by field theories with supersymmetry @xcite , only a few are known where the supersymmetry is explicitly present on the lattice . here",
    ", an unusual feature is that the supersymmetry operator changes the number of sites by one .",
    "while unusual , it is not unheard of ; similar operators were for example studied in a spin chain arising from the integrable structures in four - dimensional gauge theory @xcite .",
    "remarkable properties of the zero - energy ground state persist along the entire line ( [ eqn : xyzham ] ) @xcite . using",
    "the convenient parametrisation @xmath10 computer results indicate that the ground state at odd @xmath5 can be expressed as polynomials in @xmath11 with positive integer coefficients .",
    "non - linear recursion relations were observed for several components of the zero - energy ground states of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these relations are described by the tau - function hierarchies of the painlev vi equation @xcite . moreover ,",
    "very simple expressions for one - point functions in the ground state such as the magnetisation were found by summing the expansion around the trivially solvable point @xmath12 @xcite .    since the ground - state energy remains zero along the entire line ( [ eqn : xyzham ] ) , it is natural to expect that the supersymmetry persists off the critical point .",
    "this is true in the scaling limit , where the xyz chain is described by the sine - gordon field theory .",
    "this field theory possesses symmetries that can be related to the affine quantum group @xmath13 with zero centre @xcite .",
    "when @xmath14 , the quantum group contains the @xmath1 supersymmetry algebra .",
    "this is precisely the value of @xmath15 corresponding to the scaling limit along the line ( [ eqn : xyzham ] ) .",
    "we thus refer to this line henceforth as the `` supersymmetric '' line .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the supersymmetry remains exact on the lattice all along the supersymmetric line .",
    "the main focus in most ( but not all @xcite ) earlier studies was the ground state of the system , which has exactly zero energy for any odd @xmath5 . in this article , we study not only the ground states of this xyz spin chain , but also consider its full spectrum .",
    "we show that for any value of @xmath11 , in certain momentum sectors this model possesses a hidden exact symmetry which we call lattice supersymmetry , a lattice version of the well - known @xmath16 supersymmetry algebra @xcite .",
    "these results provide a systematic generalisation of the xxz results to the xyz setting .",
    "we illustrate this symmetry by explicitly diagonalising the xyz hamiltonian along the supersymmetric line .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the example of chains with @xmath17 and @xmath18 sites : in particular momentum sectors , the corresponding hamiltonians sites have exact common non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "this is a well - known feature of supersymmetric theories : states with @xmath19 are doubly degenerate .",
    "thus , in our case the common eigenvalues are candidates for supersymmetry doublets .",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of supercharges which change the number of sites @xmath5 by one , and serve as intertwiners for the hamiltonians of the corresponding chains .",
    "moreover , two exact zero - energy ground states are found for odd @xmath5 , and they are potential candidates for so - called supersymmetry singlets ( who do not have a superpartner ) .",
    "in fact , we will show that in the sectors with momentum zero for odd @xmath5 and momentum @xmath20 for even @xmath5 , the states organise themselves into quadruplets : an eigenvalue occurring first in the spectrum for @xmath21 sites , appears twice at @xmath5 sites , and once at @xmath22 sites .",
    "the quadruplet structure hints at the existence of two copies of the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "indeed by taking into account the symmetry under flipping all spins , we find a @xmath23 supersymmetry algebra on the lattice .",

    "the plots are restricted to the subsectors with momentum @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the solid lines correspond to exact common eigenvalues for the two chains .",

    "thus one might expect that these properties carry over to the full model .",
    "as we will show , the existence of the @xmath1 supersymmetry algebra is deeply rooted in the eight - vertex model , and can be derived from the bethe ansatz .",
    "moreover , the bethe ansatz analysis leads to a novel characterisation of the ground states of the xyz chain for odd @xmath5 .",
    "the xyz chain is closely connected to another model with lattice supersymmetry , introduced in @xcite and thoroughly analysed in @xcite .",
    "it describes spinless fermions on a chain with nearest - neighbour as well as the usual on - site exclusion .",
    "connections between the two at the critical point are already known ; energy levels coincide with those of the xxz chain at @xmath9 with a momentum - dependent twist @xcite .",
    "a similar correspondence also holds in the open chain with a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ground states of the fermion models display a variety of relations with the combinatorics describes above @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask if a similar equivalence holds off the critical point . indeed",
    ", several connections between the zero - energy ground states for chains of odd length and the ground states of a staggered version of the fermion models were observed in @xcite . in this work , we provide more evidence for the connection of the two models .",
    "we observe the systematic existence of common eigenvalues in their spectra after proper identification of the relevant parameters , even in sectors where the supersymmetry is not fully realised .",
    "the layout of this paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] , we introduce supercharges for the xyz chain which change the number of sites and study their properties .",
    "in particular , we show that hamiltonian can be obtained as a quadratic form of the supercharges in special momentum sectors .",
    "the combination with various other symmetries of the xyz chain will lead to a second lattice supersymmetry , and thus explain the quadruplet structure in the spectra . in section [ sec : bethe ] , we change our point of view and study the system using bethe ansatz for the eight - vertex model .",
    "after recalling baxter s original approach , we present a derivation of the supersymmetry from the bethe equations , and show that it is a symmetry of the full transfer matrix along the supersymmetric line , connecting systems of different sizes .",
    "after this we proceed with a conjecture on the nature of the ground states for chains of odd length .",
    "the relation of the present model to the theory of fermions with nearest - neighbour exclusion is discussed in section [ sec : fermions ] : we observe that upon proper identification of the relevant parameters , the spectra of both theories have exact common eigenvalues .",
    "we suggest a mapping between the two models , based on the bethe ansatz solution of the eight - vertex model . finally , we present our conclusions and various open problems in section [ sec : concl ] . some technical details are relegated to appendices .    throughout the paper",
    "we report observations obtained from exact diagonalisation of small system sizes .",
    "most of them show patterns which seem to hold for general @xmath5 , and thus we formulate them as conjectures .",
    "in this section , we establish the relation between the xyz chain and lattice supersymmetry .",
    "we start with a review of elementary symmetries of the xyz chain and then proceed to the definition of the supercharges .",
    "the analysis of their properties under translation allows to show that they are nilpotent and write the hamiltonian as quadratic forms of the supercharges .",
    "next , we study the interplay with other symmetries such as parity and spin reversal , and establish the quadruplet structure of the eigenstates in special momentum sectors .    in the sequel",
    ", we will frequently deal with operators that change the number of sites of the chain .",
    "hence , we will indicate by a subscript the length of the chain the corresponding operator acts on .",
    "for example , we denote by @xmath29 the supercharge acting on the hilbert space for chains with @xmath5 sites etc .",
    "we start with a bit of notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the usual hilbert space for @xmath5 spin-@xmath31 particles in a chain .",
    "we will use the standard orthonormal basis in which the operators @xmath32 are diagonal ( @xmath33 are the usual pauli matrices ) .",
    "its basis vectors are labeled by configurations @xmath34 with @xmath35 ( spin up ) or @xmath36 ( spin down ) for the @xmath37-th spin , and the @xmath38 operator acts according to @xmath39    let us indicate here some elementary symmetries of the hamiltonian , valid for any choice of @xmath40 .",
    "first , it is invariant under translation .",
    "we will often use the translation operator @xmath41 acting on basis states of @xmath42 according to the usual rule @xmath43 the translation invariance of the hamiltonian implies that it commutes with this operator , and therefore they can be diagonalised simultaneously .",
    "consider a state @xmath44 such that @xmath45 , then cyclicity implies @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the eigenvalue @xmath47 is an @xmath5-th root of unity .",
    "writing @xmath48 we see that the momentum @xmath49 has to be an integer multiple of @xmath50 . in this work ,",
    "we focus mainly on momentum @xmath51 for chains of odd length , and momentum @xmath24 for chains of even length .    moreover , the hamiltonian is invariant under reversal of the order of all spins .",
    "we thus define a parity operation @xmath52 through @xmath53 obviously , we have @xmath54 and therefore eigenvalues @xmath55 .",
    "finally , notice that the hamiltonian is a quadratic form of the pauli matrices .",
    "therefore it remains unchanged under global rotations by an angle @xmath20 around any of the @xmath56 or @xmath57axis .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath58 axis .",
    "the rotation is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 the right - hand side makes evident that @xmath61 has the eigenvalue @xmath55 on configurations with an even / odd number of spins @xmath36 .",
    "considering instead rotations by the angle @xmath20 about the @xmath62-axis leads to the conclusion that the hamiltonian commutes with the spin reversal operator @xmath63 defined through @xmath64 the operators @xmath61 and @xmath63 have the following ( anti-)commutation relation : @xmath65 this implies in particular that for odd @xmath5 the spin - reversal operator couples the sectors with even and odd number of spins down .",
    "therefore any eigenvalue of @xmath66 has even degeneracy and is at least doubly degenerate .",
    "we proceed with the definition of the supercharges .",
    "it is useful to start by recalling the usual @xmath67 supersymmetry algebra @xcite .",
    "it is built from two conjugate supercharges @xmath68 that are nilpotent , i.e.their squares are zero : @xmath69 .",
    "a further symmetry generator is the fermion number @xmath70 .",
    "the supercharges obey the relations @xmath71=q$ ] and @xmath72=-q^\\dagger$ ] .",
    "hence @xmath73 increases the fermion number by one , while @xmath74 decreases it .",
    "the hamiltonian is given as anticommutator @xmath75 .",
    "it conserves the fermion number and commutes with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that @xmath76 is of this form implies that its eigenvalues are non - negative .",
    "any states with zero energy are automatically ground states , and annihilated by both supercharges .",
    "thus they each are a supersymmetry singlet .",
    "conversely , all states with positive energy @xmath19 form doublets of the supersymmetry algebra , with the fermion numbers of the two states in a doublet differing by one .",
    "we here define the analogous supercharges on the lattice .",
    "we start with a generalisation of the work @xcite and introduce operators @xmath77 which map @xmath42 to @xmath78 through action on site @xmath37 according to the following rules ( the subscripts denote the positions of the corresponding spins ) :    @xmath79    we see that while states with spins @xmath80 at site @xmath37 are annihilated by @xmath77 , the spins @xmath36 are transformed into pairs @xmath81 or @xmath82 with weight @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "the pair creation implies a shift of the spin sequence @xmath85 by one site to the right .",
    "this includes a `` string '' @xmath86 which is crucial in the following . to respect the periodic boundary conditions here ,",
    "we need to build eigenstates of the translation operator .",
    "we thus introduce an operator that creates a pair of like spins @xmath81 or @xmath82 on sites @xmath22 and @xmath83 , namely @xmath87 [ eqn : defq ]    the operator @xmath88 acts always on the last site irrespectively of length of the chain with no string attached .    with the help of these `` local '' operators",
    "@xmath77 we construct a supercharge @xmath29 in the following way : suppose that @xmath44 is an eigenstate of the translation operator @xmath41 with some eigenvalue @xmath47",
    ". then we define @xmath89 unless @xmath90 . if @xmath90 however , we define @xmath91 for @xmath92 these operators decrease the number of @xmath36 spins by one but map a state of definite total magnetisation to another state of definite total magnetisation @xcite . for finite @xmath11",
    "however , this is not the case because the two states on the right - hand side of differ in magnetisation by two .",
    "this is related to the fact that the xyz hamiltonian can flip pairs @xmath81 and @xmath82 of adjacent spins , and thus conserves magnetisation only mod 2 .    because of @xmath88 the operator @xmath29 seems to distinguish the last site of the chain from the others",
    "however , translation invariance removes this distinction , and we claim that @xmath29 is a well - defined mapping between the momentum spaces with @xmath90 . to show this it is useful to understand the transformation properties of @xmath77 under translation . from their definition",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath93 consider now an eigenvector @xmath44 of the translation operator for the chain with @xmath5 sites : @xmath94 . upon action with @xmath29",
    "we produce a vector @xmath95 belonging to @xmath78 .",
    "the application of @xmath96 to this new vector leads to @xmath97 as @xmath90 the new vector is an eigenvector of @xmath96 , with eigenvalue @xmath98 , what proves our claim .",
    "thus , we have @xmath99 .",
    "the fact that the operators @xmath29 are _ bona fide _ mappings between the momentum spaces of interest is crucial to the supersymmetric structure of the xyz chain that we describe now .",
    "first , the supercharges have `` square zero '' in the sense that @xmath100 hence they can be thought of as fermionic .",
    "second , _ if restricted to the subsectors with translation eigenvalue @xmath90 _ the xyz - hamiltonian can be constructed from the supercharges and their hermitian conjugates .",
    "the latter are defined in the usual way : if @xmath44 is a vector in @xmath42 , and @xmath101 in @xmath78 then @xmath102 . with this definition",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as an `` anticommutator '' @xmath103 the proofs of and are elementary but cumbersome .",
    "we present the details in the appendices [ app : nilpotency ] and [ app : hamiltonian ] . here",
    ", we study their consequences for the eigenvalue spectrum , and thus give an explanation of the common eigenvalues for systems of different size .",
    "we will see that all these properties are familiar from the theory of @xmath104 supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "first of all , consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath105 . projecting back on @xmath44 we find",
    "@xmath106 it follows that the spectrum is non - negative : all @xmath107 .",
    "let us first concentrate on strictly positive energies @xmath19 . for a chain with @xmath5 sites these energies come in pairs in the sense that a given positive eigenvalue occurs in the spectrum at either @xmath22 or @xmath21 sites .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the structure of the hamiltonian in and results in the commutation relation @xmath108 hence , if @xmath44 is an eigenvector of @xmath66 with eigenvalue @xmath109 in the subspace with @xmath90 , then @xmath110 is either zero or an eigenvector of @xmath111 with the same eigenvalue @xmath109 .",
    "likewise @xmath112 is either zero or an eigenvector of @xmath113 with the same eigenvalue @xmath109 .",
    "however , one of the two vectors @xmath110 , @xmath112 must vanish with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . then @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , their respective eigenspaces associated with non - zero eigenvalues are orthogonal . if @xmath117 for some @xmath19 then @xmath118 , by reprojection on @xmath44 we find @xmath119 , and therefore @xmath120 .",
    "it follows that @xmath110 is non - zero because otherwise @xmath44 would be a zero - energy state .",
    "thus we found a doublet @xmath121 .",
    "a similar argument applies to the eigenstates of @xmath122 , and leads to pairs @xmath123 . finally , as @xmath66 commutes with @xmath124 and @xmath125",
    "it follows that all non - zero eigenstates of our hamiltonian organise in pairs in the sense stated above . ] .",
    "hence , every eigenstate with non - zero energy is part of a doublet @xmath126    conversely , zero - energy states are unpaired ( singlets ) . from",
    "it follows that they must be solution to the two equations @xmath127 it is well known that the solutions to these equations are related to the cohomology @xmath128 of the operator @xmath29 .",
    "every zero - energy eigenstate corresponds to a non - trivial ( non - zero ) element in @xmath129 .",
    "this can be seen indirectly : suppose that there are two linearly independent zero - energy states @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and assume that they are in the same cohomology class .",
    "this means that there is a state @xmath101 for the chain with @xmath21 sites such that @xmath132 we act with @xmath133 on both sides , and apply .",
    "this yields @xmath134 , and by reprojection on @xmath101 to @xmath135 .",
    "this implies @xmath136 and therefore @xmath137  in contradiction to the assumption of linear independence .",
    "hence every non - trivial cohomology class contains exactly one ground state .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , every eigenstate with non - zero energy that is annihilated by @xmath29 can be written in the form @xmath138 where @xmath101 is an eigenstate for the chain with @xmath21 sites .",
    "we will frequently use this property in the next section .",
    "second , the number of zero energy ground states is the number of distinct non - trivial elements in the cohomology .",
    "we formulate the following    we checked this conjecture up to @xmath139 sites by evaluation of the row and column ranks of the rectangular matrices @xmath29 .",
    "notice that for @xmath5 odd it implies stroganov s conjecture @xcite on the existence of two zero energy ground states , provided that one can prove that they occur in the zero - momentum sector .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us make the following comment : both the nilpotency and the supersymmetric structure of the xyz - hamiltonian studied in this section are only valid in certain momentum sectors .",
    "the nature of their derivation , given in the appendices [ app : nilpotency ] and [ app : hamiltonian ] , reveals that this restriction comes from matching the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "everything else follows from local relations .",
    "thus , we conclude that the supersymmetry has to be present in the full problem for chains of infinite length .      in this and the next section we provide a detailed discussion of the relation between supersymmetry and the other symmetries of the hamiltonian introduced in section [ sec : notations ] .",
    "let us give a motivation for this .",
    "the relation @xmath140 implies that we can not relate chains with @xmath5 sites to @xmath141 sites by sole use of the supercharges defined in the previous sections .",
    "yet , a detailed inspection of the spectra for small system sizes suggests such a connection .",
    "the most simple example is the the eigenvalue @xmath142 , appearing once in the spectrum for @xmath143 sites , twice for @xmath144 sites and once for @xmath145 sites .",
    "the inspection of other non - zero eigenvalues reveals similar patterns .",
    "this hints at a larger symmetry algebra which we analyse in this section .",
    "the existence of these degeneracies can be explained through a remarkably simple observation .",
    "the supercharges @xmath29 introduced in section [ sec : defsusy ] treat spins up and down in a very asymmetric way .",
    "however , the hamiltonian commutes with the spin - reversal operator , as pointed out in section [ sec : notations ] .",
    "therefore it seems natural to introduce the spin - reversed version of @xmath29 : @xmath146 in order to understand the implications of this operator on the spectrum we need to work out the algebra generated @xmath147 and their adjoints .",
    "the full list of relations reads    @xmath148    the hamiltonian can be written as anticommutator of either set of supercharges @xmath149 [ eqn : n22susy ]    in fact , even any linear combination @xmath150 with @xmath151 is an admissible supercharge that will generate the hamiltonian .",
    "we omit the proofs of and as they are tedious and very similar to the proof of nilpotency outlined in appendix [ app : nilpotency ] .",
    "instead , we point out the striking analogies between and the @xmath1 supersymmetry algebra in two dimensional quantum field theory ( see for example @xcite , chapter 22 ) .",
    "the latter consists of supercharges @xmath152 , hamiltonian @xmath153 , momentum @xmath154 and a fermion number @xmath155 .",
    "the algebra is defined through the relations    @xmath156=\\pm \\mathsf q_\\pm,\\quad    [ \\mathsf f,\\overline { \\mathsf q}_\\pm]=\\mp \\overline { \\mathsf q}_\\pm .    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eqn : n22qftsusy ]    together with the conjugation relations @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the definition @xmath153 and @xmath154 implies that they commute with all supercharges and the fermion number .",
    "the operators @xmath159 and @xmath160 are central elements .",
    "non - zero values of the latter are usually an indication of topological sectors @xcite which occur generically in non - compact spaces .",
    "the similarity between the two algebraic structures and is certainly not a coincidence .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in the introduction , the scaling limit of the lattice model is described by the sine - gordon field theory at the supersymmetric point . precisely , the limit is @xmath161 with @xmath162 finite , and it yields the sine - gordon theory with bare mass @xmath163 and coupling @xmath164 in conventional units .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the sine - gordon field theory possesses an affine quantum group symmetry @xmath13 , @xmath165 with zero centre .",
    "for @xmath164 the latter is known to contain the @xmath1 supersymmetry algebra @xcite , which indeed corresponds to our coupling .",
    "let us establish a dictionary between the lattice and field theory quantities .",
    "the first three lines of and are in one - to - one correspondence , provided that we identify the field theory charges with some linear combinations of the lattice supercharges , and replace anticommutators by appropriate ( and natural ) expressions for the lattice operators .",
    "we see that there is no equivalent of the central charges @xmath166 in the lattice theory as the corresponding anticommutators are zero .",
    "we attribute this to the fact , that we have a finite , discrete and periodic space , and thus no topological / solitonic sector .",
    "the fourth line of defines the field theory hamiltonian and momentum .",
    "whereas the former is related to the lattice xyz hamiltonian in a direct way , the identification between momenta in field and lattice theory needs to be supplemented by a shift by @xmath167 .",
    "the need for a shift becomes even more plausible when taking into account that the lattice equivalent of fermion number appears to be the number of sites of the spin chain .",
    "this is consistent with the jordan - wigner transformation appearing in the analysis of continuum limit of the xyz chain @xcite .",
    "it is known that all non - zero energy states of a theory possessing the @xmath1 supersymmetry are organised in quadruplets of the form @xmath168 with the state @xmath44 being annihilated by @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the states in such a supermultiplet have all the same energy , and momentum , but differ in their fermion number . given the similarities between the field theory and lattice algebra , it is natural to ask if there is a quadruplet structure in the lattice model .",
    "indeed , we now show that the relations imply that it exists , at least in the momentum sectors considered in this paper . from the last section , we already know that the eigenstates @xmath44 of the lattice hamiltonian @xmath66 are part of doublets @xmath123 or @xmath121 . without loss of generality , we focus on the second case @xmath121 .",
    "let us consider the vector @xmath171 .",
    "there are two possibilities : it may either be non - zero or zero .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath171 is a non - zero vector . clearly , it has the same energy as @xmath110 , and we might wonder if they coincide .",
    "in fact , we show that this can not be the case , and that they are rather linearly independent",
    ". if there is linear dependence , then there must be non - zero numbers @xmath172 and @xmath173 such that @xmath174 .",
    "we show that @xmath175 by applying @xmath176 from the left . for the first term , we use @xmath177 ; for the second term , we make use of the anticommutation relation and write @xmath178 .",
    "thus , we are left with @xmath179 but because of @xmath19 we must have @xmath175 .",
    "likewise , one shows that @xmath180 .",
    "thus , the two vectors are linearly independent .",

    "it can not be zero : otherwise , we could write @xmath197 what contradicts our assumptions as we started from a doublet @xmath198 . moreover , the state @xmath196 is linearly independent from @xmath44 , as follows from the same argument as above .",
    "we have @xmath199 , and hence a similar quadruplet structure as before , this time however with one state at @xmath21 sites , _ two _ states at @xmath5 sites , and one state @xmath22 sites : @xmath200    therefore , all states with non - zero energy must be part of a quadruplet .",
    "we see that our argument leads automatically to a degeneracy in the `` middle '' of such a quadruplet .",
    "in fact , there is a non - trivial conserved charge that maps between these two states .",

    "let us now consider a state @xmath44 for a chain of @xmath5 sites with both definite translational behaviour @xmath219 and definite parity @xmath220 .",
    "the parity operation reverses momentum , as can be seen from the relation @xmath221 .",
    "this implies that the translation eigenvalue @xmath47 must be solution to @xmath222 .",
    "obviously , this is compatible with @xmath90 .",
    "applying our rules , we find @xmath223 thus , we find that ( 1 ) for @xmath5 odd , @xmath224 the action of @xmath225 preserves parity and ( 2 ) for @xmath5 even , @xmath226 the action of @xmath225 reverses parity .",

    "this statement can be sharpened by analysing different momentum sectors . as an example , we provide the characteristic polynomial @xmath456 for the xyz hamiltonian with @xmath145 sites in the subsector with momentum @xmath24 : @xmath457 the characteristic polynomial @xmath458 for the fermion model at @xmath459 sites in the subsector with @xmath460 particles and @xmath461 is given by : @xmath462 if we set @xmath463 and use the change of variables , then coincides with up to the factor @xmath464 and an unimportant global numerical factor .",

    "studying the spectra up to @xmath468 , we are led to the the following conjecture :     + this conjecture identifies sectors of the two models where their supersymmetries are exactly realised . yet , it appears that the connection is even deeper .",
    "we analysed the relations between the models for antiperiodic or _ neveu - schwarz boundary conditions _",
    "@xmath469 on the fermions . in this case , the supersymmetry of the fermion model is broken .",
    "the spectrum needs no longer be positive , and indeed the ground state has negative energy .",

    "this sector is unlikely to share properties with the momentum sectors discussed so far in this paper because they have explicit unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "we found however coincidence with the spectrum of the xyz chain of even length @xmath278 and _ zero _ momentum .",
    "we illustrate it once again by showing the explicit characteristic polynomials for @xmath460 .",

    "we find @xmath518 reversing the order of the @xmath15 s , we have to take into account the shift and therefore consider @xmath519 . its action yields @xmath520 we see that this result coincides with the previous one , except for a minus sign . combining these two equations , we find therefore @xmath521 when acting on @xmath42",
    ".    these relations are useful in order to prove that the supercharges are nilpotent in the sense stated above . in a first step ,",
    "we observe that the and can be used to reduce the product of the supercharges to @xmath522 let us examine the different terms in this sum .",
    "the individual terms are non - vanishing only if they act on the following states in @xmath523 : @xmath524 as all the expressions are proportional to @xmath11 we see that in the xxz limit @xmath92 the relation @xmath525 is immediate . actually , it would not even be necessary to impose the restriction to certain momentum spaces in this case .",
    "however , for general @xmath526 the relation only survives on the special momentum sectors .",
    "intuitively , this can be seen as follows : we see that the operations defined in insert pairs @xmath81 to left and right of a spin @xmath36 , thus we expect that the summation of these on a periodic chain will lead to telescopic cancellations .",
    "this will however only work in a momentum sector compatible with the sign in the third expression in which coincides with the eigenvalue of the translation operator . more concretely ,",

    "this proves the statement @xmath538 .      in this appendix",
    "we show in detail that if we restrict the hamiltonian to subsectors where the eigenvalue of the translation operator is @xmath90 then it can be written as `` anticommutator '' @xmath539 first , it is useful to introduce the projector on the momentum spaces that we are interested in .",

    "after some algebra , we are left with @xmath545 the remaining quadratic terms can be expressed through simple spin operators .",
    "we find @xmath546 and @xmath547 .",
    "using these relations and again translation invariance , we conclude that @xmath548 the expression on the right - hand side is nothing but the restriction of the xyz - hamiltonian ( [ eqn : xyzham],[eqn : param ] ) to the momentum sectors with @xmath90 , what proves the statement .",
    "in this appendix we show that the supercharge in the path basis can be written as linear superposition of the supercharges defined in section [ sec : defsusy ] for the most simple case of three and two sites .",
