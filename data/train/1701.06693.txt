    "since the seminal works of bloch@xcite and zener@xcite it is well established that electrons in a periodic potential exhibit oscillatory motion after a static electric field is switched on ( for a review see ref .  ) . the periodic motion of the electrons in this context is also known as bloch oscillations ( bos ) .",
    "the period of the oscillations is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is planck s constant , @xmath2 is the lattice spacing and @xmath3 the electric field - strength .",
    "in practice the bos are typically suppressed by loss of coherence due to collisions , which makes it challenging to observe bos in experiments . over the last decades bos have been found and characterized in various systems , for instance in semiconductor super - lattices @xcite , ultracold atomic gases @xcite or photonic waveguide arrays @xcite .    also on the theoretical side",
    "there has been considerable interest in studying bos .",
    "for instance , their interplay with disorder@xcite , light@xcite , interactions@xcite or other degrees of freedom@xcite has been investigated . in many cases ,",
    "the essential physics can already be captured using a single - band approximation and considering a one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding ( tb ) chain@xcite .    in most theoretical studies",
    "bos have been considered in infinite systems . here",
    ", we investigate the emergence of bos in a system where the electric field is confined to a finite - size region .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the typical setup of a device coupled to electronic leads .",
    "if the device is sufficiently small , one expects to find a direct current ( dc ) in the steady state . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is infinitely large , one will get bos as discussed above . in this article",
    "we study the transition between the two regimes by increasing the device size and by changing the magnitude of the applied electric field .",
    "an important issue is the detection of bos in such devices .",
    "we propose a pump - probe scheme , which uses the rising and falling flanks of a nearly rectangular pulse , to obtain information about the internal dynamics and bos .    as in ref .",
    "we consider a 1d tb system . to account for the time - dependence of the electric field",
    ", we use a recently developed numerical method@xcite , which is based on the time - dependent non - equilibrium green s function ( tdnegf ) formalism @xcite in combination with an auxiliary - mode expansion@xcite .",
    "this approach has already been successfully applied to study time - dependent nanoelectronics@xcite and it allows us to obtain the time - dependent currents and occupations during and after the pulse has been applied .",
    "this information is then used to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of the electrons in the device .",
