    "dynamical processes are strongly affected by the structure of the pattern which mediates interactions .",
    "this common wisdom , whose evidence has been confirmed by decades of investigations in statistical mechanics , has assumed a new relevance in recent years , with the advent of complex networks theory .",
    "percolation , epidemic spreading or synchronization are among the phenomena for which the effect of a disordered topology has been more thoroughly studied  @xcite , but for many other types of dynamics a complex substrate structure also induces novel and nontrivial dynamical behavior  @xcite .",
    "this occurs in particular when the pattern of connections is extremely heterogeneous , as in scale - free ( sf ) networks , where the probability that an element is connected to @xmath0 others ( the degree distribution ) is given by a power - law form @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "along with the recognition that dynamics on networks can be very different from lattices , comes the natural question about how theoretical methods can be adapted to deal with topologically complex substrates .",
    "it has been early recognized that the standard mean - field approach must be modified on strongly heterogeneous networks , to take into account the broad variability in the connectivity of vertices  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theory  @xcite the order parameter is replaced by a set of analogous quantities which depend explicitly on the degree @xmath0 of the node considered ( the degree of a node is the number of other nodes to which it is directly linked ) .",
    "this simple modification turns out to describe with remarkable accuracy the behavior of many systems , reinforcing the nave expectation that mean - field methods must work on networks , due to their infinite - dimensional nature .    for this reason it came as a surprise when the numerical investigation of the behavior of the contact process ( cp ) on generic power - law distributed networks gave results in apparent disagreement with the predictions of hmf theory  @xcite .",
    "the contact process  @xcite is an extremely simple model for spreading , which , in a general network , is defined as follows : vertices can be in two different states , either empty or occupied .",
    "the dynamics includes the spontaneous annihilation of occupied vertices , which become empty at unitary rate , and the occupation of empty neighbors by occupied vertices , with rate @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the degree of the occupied node .",
    "the model is characterized by a phase transition at a value of the control parameter @xmath4 , separating an active phase from an absorbing one , devoid of occupied vertices  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the hmf theory for cp was derived in the limit of infinite network size .",
    "its predictions could not be directly checked against numerical simulations because of the presence of extremely large finite size effects .",
    "a comparison was made possible by the introduction of a finite size scaling ( fss ) ansatz  @xcite , adapted to a network topology , leading to the conclusion that cp dynamics on quenched networks was not described by the hmf approximation .",
    "such a claim was criticized by park and collaborators  @xcite , which later proposed an alternative fss ansatz , based on a droplet excitation theory  @xcite .",
    "a discrimination between the two approaches turned out to be nontrivial : even for simulations on annealed networks , which are expected to be described exactly by mean - field theory , numerical results did not satisfactorily conform to any of the two competing theories  @xcite .",
    "clarifying results on this issue have been obtained later  @xcite , revealing that fss on annealed networks is actually more complicated than previously assumed . at odds with what happens in lattices ,",
    "the behavior of the cp on networks of finite size depends not only on the number of vertices @xmath5 but also on the moments of the degree distribution .",
    "this last feature implies , for sf networks , that the scaling around the transition depends explicitly on how the largest degree @xmath6 diverges with @xmath5 . such a dependence ( which both previous fss approaches were lacking )",
    "introduces very strong corrections to scaling .",
    "however , if such corrections are properly taken into account , it is possible to show that the cp on annealed networks agrees , with high accuracy , with the predictions of hmf theory  @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison between hmf and precise numerical results for annealed networks has been possible by using the quasi - stationary ( qs ) state simulation method  @xcite .",
    "this is an optimized numerical technique which prevents the system from falling into the absorbing configuration , thus allowing the detailed investigation of the order parameter close to the transition for finite systems .    in the present paper ,",
    "we go beyond the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and exploit qs simulations for studying the cp transition on quenched sf networks .",
    "we assume that finite size scaling on quenched networks has exactly the same anomalous form valid on annealed ones . in this way",
    "we are able to determine , with an unprecedented accuracy , the location of the critical point and the value of the exponents associated with the transition .",
    "it turns out that the exponents computed numerically for quenched networks are in excellent agreement with the hmf predictions : the cp on networks definitely obeys heterogeneous mean - field theory .",
    "this result fills the gap in the debate about the validity of hmf theory for cp",
    ". both competing theories  @xcite were not correct .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between theory and numerics reported in ref .",
    "@xcite was due to an incorrect fss theory and the presence of large corrections to scaling in simulations .",
    "the alternative fss approach of ref .",
    "@xcite was incorrect as well .",
    "the correct fss theory is more complicated than previously assumed , but perfectly accounts for numerical results on both annealed and quenched networks .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows : in section ii we describe the quenched networks considered , the contact process dynamics , and the qs simulation method .",
    "the numerical determination of the transition point and the associated exponents are presented in sec .",
    "our concluding remarks are discussed in sec .",
    "the cp is simulated on quenched networks with @xmath5 vertices and degree sequence @xmath7 .",
    "the networks are built according to the configuration model ( cm )  @xcite , where the degree of each vertex is defined at the beginning of the simulation as a random variable with a power law distribution @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the degree distribution has a hard degree cutoff @xmath10 ( degrees larger than @xmath6 are not allowed ) , where @xmath11 is the cutoff exponent .",
    "this choice reduces sample to sample fluctuations that make the critical analysis difficult even for the simpler case of annealed networks @xcite .",
    "two models for the link assignment are investigated , namely , random and ordered configuration models . in the random cm @xcite , two stubs ( not connected links )",
    "are selected at random and the respective nodes connected , avoiding self and multiple connections .",
    "the procedure is repeated until all stubs are joined . in the ordered cm nodes",
    "are sorted in descending degree order .",
    "then a stub of the most connected node is connected to another randomly selected stub , avoiding self and multiple connections .",
    "after all stubs of the largest vertex are connected , the next most connected node with free stubs is picked up and the procedure is repeated until all stubs are connected .",
    "the ordering of nodes allows to build large networks even for @xmath12 , which is usually impossible with random selection of nodes .",
    "a consequence of this nonrandom procedure is that disassortative degree correlations are generated  @xcite .",
    "the cp simulations on an arbitrary network are performed with the standard protocol  @xcite : at each time step , an occupied vertex @xmath13 is chosen at random and time is updated as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 is the number of occupied vertices at time @xmath17 . with probability @xmath18 , the occupied vertex becomes vacant . with complementary probability @xmath19 , one of its @xmath20 neighbors",
    "is randomly selected and , if empty , it becomes occupied .",
    "if the selected neighbor is already occupied nothing happens and the simulation proceeds to the next step .    the standard numerical procedure to investigate the finite size scaling at absorbing phase transitions is based on the determination of the average of the order parameter ( in this case the density of active nodes ) , @xmath21 , restricted only to surviving runs .",
    "such a technique is quite inefficient , because surviving configurations are very rare at long times , and in order to get precise results an exceedingly large number of realization of the process is needed .",
    "an alternative strategy consists in constraining the system in a quasi - stationary state and measuring its properties . in practice",
    "this is implemented by replacing the absorbing state , every time the system tries to visit it , with an active configuration randomly taken from the history of the simulation  @xcite .",
    "for this task , a list of @xmath22 active configurations is stored and constantly updated .",
    "an update consists in randomly choosing a configuration in the list and replacing it by the present active configuration with a probability @xmath23 . after a relaxation time @xmath24 ,",
    "the qs quantities are determined during an averaging time @xmath25 .",
    "the qs probability @xmath26 that @xmath27 vertices are occupied is computed during the averaging interval , each configuration with @xmath27 active vertices contributing to the qs distribution with a probability proportional to its lifespan , i.e. proportional to @xmath28 . from the particle distribution @xmath26 ,",
    "the characteristic properties of the qs state can be computed , such as the density of active nodes @xmath29 and the characteristic relaxation time  @xcite @xmath30 the qs method , which had been previously used to accurately determine the universality class of several models with absorbing configurations @xcite , was recently applied to investigate the critical properties of the cp in annealed sf networks @xcite .",
    "the fss method for non - equilibrium absorbing phase transitions usually assumes , at the transition , an asymptotic power - law dependence with the system size of the order parameter , @xmath31 , and of the characteristic temporal scale , @xmath32 .",
    "values of the control parameter above and below the critical point give rise to positive and negative curvatures in plots of @xmath33 versus @xmath34 , respectively , for large @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the cp in annealed networks has a different , anomalous , scaling form  @xcite which includes an explicit dependence on the factor @xmath35 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the same form was analytically shown to hold on annealed networks for the qs density @xmath36 and characteristic time @xmath37 , namely @xmath38",
    "the presence of the factor @xmath39 , which can be determined exactly for a given degree distribution @xmath40 , brings an additional dependence on @xmath5 for @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the exponents predicted by hmf theory for the critical properties as a function of @xmath5 are @xcite : @xmath42",
    "the qs simulations are performed on networks with sizes ranging from @xmath43 up to @xmath44 and up to times @xmath45 .",
    "the so - called structural ( @xmath46 ) and natural ( @xmath47 ) hard cutoffs  @xcite are considered .",
    "the structural cutoff leads to the absence of degree - degree correlations @xcite in the random cm . in this case",
    ", the procedure to build the network corresponds to the uncorrelated configuration model ( ucm )  @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the ordered cm has , for @xmath41 , disassortative degree - degree correlations , which are disregarded in the hmf analysis  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the qs distributions starts after a relaxation time @xmath48 .",
    "the dynamics is run for several independent network realizations in order to average over many topological configurations . between @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "network samples were used for each value of @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to notice that the critical relaxation time is very short when compared to the same quantity for regular lattices below the critical dimension , due to the small world property of complex networks .      in a quenched network",
    "the investigation of the transition is made difficult by the presence of dynamical correlations , which shift the position of the critical point . from the analytical point of view",
    "the simplest way to take them into account is by means of a homogeneous pair approximation , which yields  @xcite @xmath51 .",
    "the criterion of null curvature , usually applied to find numerically the critical point in regular lattices ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] ) was used for the cp on quenched networks  @xcite . however , as shown for annealed networks  @xcite , such method for estimating the critical point can be misleading if anomalous scaling of the form  ( [ eq : rhoscl ] ) occurs .",
    "additionally , dynamical analyses like spreading experiments and density decay in time  @xcite require absence of finite size effects which are unavoidable in random networks with the small world property  @xcite .     for cp on annealed sf networks with degree exponent @xmath52 and cutoff exponent @xmath46 .",
