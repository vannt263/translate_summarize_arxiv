    "diffractive hadronic processes are a special class of production mechanisms when forward emitted proton(s ) is ( are ) accompanied by a sizeable ( a few rapidity units ) rapidity gap(s ) starting from the most forward ( in rapidity ) proton(s ) towards midrapidities .",
    "if only one of the forward protons is required , such processes are called single - diffractive .",
    "these processes were studied theoretically in the so - called resolved pomeron model @xcite .",
    "it was realized during the tevatron studies that the model , previously used to describe deep - inelastic diffractive processes , must be corrected to take into account absorption effects related to hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "such interactions , unavoidably present in hadronic collisions at high energies and not present in electron / positron induced processes , lead to a damping of the diffractive cross section defined above . in theoretical models",
    "this effect is taken into account by multiplying the diffractive cross section calculated using hera diffractive pdfs by a phase - space independent factor called the gap survival probability  @xmath2 .",
    "two theoretical groups specialize in calculating such probabilities @xcite and provide numerical values of @xmath2 for various energies and different types of diffractive mechanisms . at high energies such factors , interpreted as probabilities , are very small ( of the order of a few % ) .",
    "this causes that the predictions of the diffractive cross sections are not as precise as those for the standard inclusive non - diffractive cases .",
    "this may become a challenge after a precise data from the lhc will become available .",
    "several processes have been considered theoretically and discussed in the literature .",
    "studies were performed for single @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite boson , di - jet @xcite , direct photon @xcite , photon - jet @xcite , di - lepton @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite pair production .",
    "this list in not complete and other processes are also possible .    from the experimental side there are also several interesting results published .",
    "for example : rapidity cross sections @xcite , production of diffractive minimum - bias @xcite , production of @xmath3 bosons @xcite and di - jets @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider diffractive production of charm for which rather large cross section at the lhc are expected , even within the leading - order ( lo ) collinear approach @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was shown that for the inclusive non - diffractive charm production the lo collinear approach is rather poor approximation and higher - order corrections are crucial .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1-factorization approach , which effectively includes higher - order effects , gives a good description of the lhc data for inclusive charm production at @xmath7 = 7 tev ( see _ e.g_. ref .",
    "this strongly suggests that application of the @xmath1-factorization approach to diffractive charm production would be useful .",
    "besides , the dipole approach is also often used to calculate cross section for diffractive processes .",

    "@xcite , it gives only a small fraction of the diffractive cross section for the charm production .    to sum up",
    ", the measurement of diffractive production of charm would be very useful to pin down the mechanism of diffractive production in general .",

    "fig : mechanism ] . here , we propose extension of the standard resolved pomeron model @xcite based on the lo collinear approach by adopting a framework of the @xmath8-factorization as an effective way to include higher - order corrections .",
    "such an approach is very usefull _",
    "e.g. _ in the studies of kinematical correlations @xcite .",
    "according to this model the cross section for a single - diffractive production of charm quark - antiquark pair , for both considered diagrams ( left and right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ] ) , can be written as : @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the `` conventional '' unintegrated ( @xmath8-dependent ) gluon distributions ( ugdfs ) in the proton and @xmath12 are their diffractive counterparts  which we will call here diffractive ugdfs ( dugdfs ) .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as a probability of finding a gluon with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath13 and transverse momentum ( virtuality ) @xmath8 at the factorization scale @xmath14 assuming that the proton which lost a momentum fraction @xmath15 remains intact .    in the approach",
    "applied here , we neglect a possible influence of the pomeron / reggeon transverse momentum on the transverse momentum of the initial off - shell gluon from pomeron / reggeon .",
    "the effect is assumed to be negligible since the transverse momenta of incident gluon are typically larger ( or much larger ) than the transverse momenta of pomeron / reggeon ( equal to the transverse momenta of outgoing proton ) .",
    "we will come back to the issue when presenting numerical results .",
    "the partonic cross section for the considered hard scattering reads : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the momenta and energies of outgoing @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , and @xmath21 is the off - shell matrix element for the @xmath22 sub - process .",
    "according to the so - called proton - vertex factorization , the diffractive collinear gluon distribution in the proton can be written in the form where the variables related with the proton kinematics are separated from those connected with the hard interaction : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of pomeron carried by gluon and the flux of pomerons may be taken as : @xmath25 the unintegrated ( @xmath1-dependent ) diffractive gluon distributions in the proton can be easily obtained from the collinear diffractive pdfs by applying the kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) approach @xcite . according to this procedure",

    "the above definition is fully satisfied for @xmath33 , where @xmath34  gev is the minimum scale for which dglap evolution of the collinear diffractive pdfs is valid .",
    "the sudakov form factor @xmath35 is responsible for virtual loop corrections and gives the probability of evolving from a scale @xmath1 to a scale @xmath36 without any new parton emissions . in the simplified form",
    "it may be written as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of quark - antiquark flavours into which the gluon may split . due to the presence of the sudakov form factor in the kmr prescription only last emission generates transverse momentum of the incoming gluons .",
    "the unique feature of the kmr model of ugdf is providing possibility for the emission of at most one additional gluon .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the kmr model may include in an effective way higher - order corrections to heavy quark production cross section .    because of the ugdf definition in the kmr approach one needs to also apply the following transformation : @xmath39 then the normalisation condition for diffractive unintegrated gluon distribution : @xmath40 is exactly satisfied if one defines : @xmath41 so that the density of gluons in proton is constant for @xmath42 at fixed @xmath13 and @xmath36 .    in this paper , the conventional non - diffractive kmr ugdfs",

    "we have presented a first application of the @xmath1-factorization to the hard single - diffractive production .    in our approach",
    "we decided to use the so - called kmr method to calculate diffractive unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "as usually in the kmr approach , we have calculated diffractive gluon ugdfs based on collinear distribution , which here is the diffractive collinear gluon distribution . in our calculations",
    "we have used the h1 collaboration parametrization fitted to the hera data on diffractive structure function and di - jet production .",
    "having obtained unintegrated diffractive gluon distributions we have performed calculations of several single - particle and correlation distributions .",
    "the results have been compared with the results of the leading - order collinear approximation . in general , the @xmath1-factorization approach leads to larger cross sections .",
    "however , the @xmath110-factor is strongly dependent on phase space point .",
    "we expect that our new predictions are better than the previous ones obtained in the collinear approach .",
    "some correlation observables , like azimuthal angle correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath0 pair transverse momentum have been calculated for the first time .",
    "the obtained cross sections for diffractive production of charmed mesons are fairly large and one could measure them . such a measurement should give a chance not only to better understand the underlying mechanism of diffractive charm production but also the diffractive production in general .",
    "therefore , we have supplemented our theoretical studies by a feasibility ones .",
    "the search of diffractive production of charm was assumed to be done using forward proton spectrometers installed by the atlas and totem collaborations at the lhc .",
    "these experiments should be able to measure @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 charmed mesons produced with diffractively scattered proton .",
    "taking the example of @xmath82 production , we have shown that after the signal selection , a pure and significant measurement is expected to be doable for a wide range of experimental conditions ( @xmath107 ) .    in future , other unintegrated diffractive parton distributions",
    "can be calculated in an analogous way ( kmr method ) as for gluons .",
    "such a new distributions could be used for other hard diffractive processes .",
    "this would open a new situation in studying hard diffractive processes .",
    "several useful correlation observables would become accessible with this technology .",
    "a next step would be _",
    "e.g. _ diffractive production of di - jets . for gauge boson production",
    "one could try to discuss transverse momentum distributions as was done for the inclusive case .",
    "clearly , new perspectives are now open .",
