    "the present article is the third in a series of long papers attempting to give a comprehensive description of the physics of flat space - time ( i.e. , in the absence of gravitational effects ) by correcting certain errors in the application of the space - time lorentz transformation ( lt ) originating in einstein s first special relativity paper  @xcite .",
    "the error was the neglect of certain additive constants in the transformation equations , necessary to correctly describe synchronised clocks at different spatial positions .",
    "although einstein pointed out the necessity to include such constants in ref .",
    "@xcite this was not done by einstein himself or by subsequent authors . as shown by the present author in ref  @xcite , correction of this error",
    "renders spurious the ` length contraction ' ( lc ) and ` relativity of simultaneity ' ( rs ) effects of conventional special relativity theory . for further discussion of this point see refs .  @xcite .",
    "although there is ample experimental verification of the time dilatation ( td ) effect , predicted using the space - time lt in ref  @xcite , there is , to date , no published experimental test of the lc or rs effects  @xcite .",
    "the present author has proposed a test of rs using two satellites in low earth orbit  @xcite , or gps satellites in combination with a single satellite in low earth orbit  @xcite .",
    "the first of the long papers  @xcite discussed the axiomatic basis of special relativity theory , recalling in an appendix two previously - published derivations of the lt that do not use einstein s second postulate concerning the constancy of the speed of light .",
    "this paper introduces a calculus of pointer - mark coincidences with a view to giving a mathematically rigorous description of experimental space and time measurements .",
    "also presented are several different clock synchronisation procedures , not employing light signals and so not affected by considerations of ` conventionality ' inherent in the the assumption of light - speed isotropy  @xcite .    the second long paper  @xcite is a detailed critique of einstein s original special relativity paper  @xcite . as well as containing concepts and predictions that revolutionised the understanding of physics , ref .",
    "@xcite also contains many mistakes , both of a mathematical nature , and of physical interpretation , for example , the spurious rs and lc effects . in view of the importance of classical electromagnetism in the arguments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the modern reassessment of this paper in ref .",
    "@xcite uses results from work by the present author on relativistic classical electrodynamics  @xcite derived as the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the subject of the present paper is a study of the precise operational meaning of the coordinate symbols which appear in the space - time lt , with the aim of understanding the physical basis of the differential aging effect ( dae ) that underlies the ` twin paradox ' as orginally introduced by langevin  @xcite .",
    "this paradox arises from the following considerations .",
    "a travelling twin , t , makes a round trip to a distant star while her brother , r , remains on earth . assuming that the periods of uniform motion are much larger than those of acceleration or deceleration during the journey , then",
    ", due to td , r will see a clock carried by t and measuring the increment of her age , to run slow , throughout the journey , compared to a similar clock at rest in his own frame and measuring the increment of his own age during t s journey .",
    "r will then see that t is younger than he is on her return to earth . however , from t s point of view",
    ", assuming that that the td effect depends only on the magnitude of the relative velocity , it might be concluded that the clock carried by r will appear to t to be running slow , throughout the journey , as compared to the clock at rest in t s frame .",
    "therefore , on her return , t will find that she is older than , not younger than , r. since t can not be both younger than , and older than , r , the above description leads to a paradox .",
    "the physical meaning of the time symbols occuring in the space - time lt is crucial for the resolution of the above paradox in fact it is the travelling twin , t , who is the youngest . particularly important is the distinction , explained in section 4 below , between a primary experiment and its reciprocal as compared to a transformation of space - time coordinates and its inverse . before the work presented in the present paper",
    ", its author had not appreciated this important distinction and its relation to the ` reciprocity principle ' ( rp )  @xcite which states that : ` if the velocity of an inertial frame s ' relative to another such frame s is @xmath0 , then the velocity of s relative to s is @xmath1. as will be seen below , the rp , although valid in galilean relativity , no longer holds in special relativity as a consequence of td and the invariance of spatial intervals when space - time as opposed to kinematical ( energy - momentum ) lts are considered .",
    "earlier versions of several papers written recently by the present author , assuming the correctness of the rp in applications of the space - time lt in special relativity  @xcite therefore contain erroneous arguments and must be extensively revised . to date",
    ", the general validity of the rp in special relativity has been universally ( although usually tacitly ) assumed . as will be seen",
    "it is the basis of the ` standard solution ' of the twin paradox in which the physical origin of the dae is traced to lc of spatial intervals in the travelling twin s frame .",
    "as will be seen , the rp must be replaced by a related but distinct ` kinematical reciprocity principle ' ( krp ) that , unlike the rp , is valid in both galilean and special relativity .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the following section as an instructive preamble , five different ways to measure the length of a train are discussed .",
    "reflecting on the assumptions underlying these methods gives the key to understanding the correct solution of the twin paradox . in section 3 a nomenclature and notation to describe different space - time experiments is introduced .",
    "inertial frames are classified according to three different criteria : subject or object , source or target and base or travelling .",
    "the notation specifies each of these six attributes for any given coordinate .",
    "several examples are given of applications of the notation : time dilatation , simultaneity of events in two inertial frames , lorentz invariance of length intervals , relativistic reciprocity relations , velocity addition formulae , transverse and longitudinal photon clocks , einstein s 1905 discussion of ` relativity of simultaneity ' and einstein s train - embankment thought experiment .",
    "section 4 discusses the differing concepts of inverse space - time transformations and reciprocal experiments .",
    "the twin paradox and its solution is discussed , in the light of the analyses of several different thought experiments , in section 5 . in section 6",
    "the standard solution of the twin paradox is applied to the ` space billiard ' thought experiment introduced in section 5 and contrasted with the correct solution presented in the same section . in section 7 the twin paradox",
    "is discussed in relation to the minkowski space - time plot . in this connection ,",
    "the recent paper  @xcite by the present author pointing out an angular sign error in drawing the directions of the space and time coordinate axes of of the moving frame , originating in minkowski s original work  @xcite , is important . correcting this error",
    "invalidates the standard solution of the twin paradox as derived from the space - time plot .",
    "section 8 contains a brief summary and some closing comments .",
    "in space - time physics there is a close connection between the concepts of physical space and time , and that of uniform motion , that is encapsulated in galileo s equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are space and time intervals respectively defined in a common reference frame and @xmath5 is a constant velocity describing , for example , the motion of the origin , o , of an inertial frame , s , relative to another one , s , in the direction of a common @xmath6-@xmath7 axis .",
    "eqn(2.1 ) can be used to convert space measurements into time measurements and _ vice versa _ when the value of @xmath5 is known .",
    "for example an analogue clock is based on a formula similar to ( 2.1 ) where the spatial interval is replaced by an angular one and the spatial velocity by a constant angular velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the length of a physical object ( say a train ) can be measured either by direct comparison with some other physical physical object of known spatial extent a ruler , or by making use of eqn(2.1 ) . the simplest way to measure",
    "the length of an object is by direct comparison of its ends with marks on a ruler in the rest frame of the former , the ruler also being at rest in the same frame .",
    "time plays no role in such a measurement .",
    "the spatial coincidences of the front and back ends of the train with the ruler marks can be observed at any times convenient for the experimenter .",
    "the length of the train is defined as the difference between the numbers associated with the ruler marks that coincide with the front and back ends of the train  @xcite .",
    "the second method is similar , except that the measured object is in arbitary motion ( i.e. , in uniform or accelerated motion ) .",
    "the length of the train is still measured by observing the spatial coincidences of the front and back of the train with ruler marks , but it is now essential that that the observations are performed simultaneously in the rest frame of the ruler . alternatively , if the observers at different spatial positions are equipped with synchronised clocks , and it is known that the motion of the train is uniform , but not the value of its speed , the length of the train and its speed may be determined from observations of spatial coincidences of the front and back of the train with ruler marks at different , but known , times  @xcite .    the third method , restricted to the case of uniformly moving object with a known speed , is for single observer in the rest frame of the ruler , equipped with a clock , to measure the time difference , @xmath9 , between the passages of the front and back ends of the moving train past a fixed ruler mark .",
    "the length of the train , @xmath3 , is then given by eqn(2.1 ) .",
    "the fourth method is a variant of the third in which the train remains at rest , say in the frame s , and the observer , equipped with a clock , passes by in another train , say with rest frame s , moving at a known uniform speed .",
    "the observer records the times at which he passes by the two ends of the train and calculates its length with eqn(2.1 ) .",
    "this method is also applicable when both the observer and the measured train are in motion with known speeds , when an appropriate velocity addition formula is used to calculate the speed , @xmath5 , to be substituted in ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the fifth method involves observation , in the frame s , of the time difference of spatial coincidences of the front end of the moving train , with rest frame s , used in the fourth method , with the back and front ends of the stationary to - be - measured train .",
    "again the length of the train is given by eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) .",
    "suppose now that two independant measurements of the length of a train are made , one using the fourth and the other the fifth of the methods just described .",
    "if different results are obtained for the length of the train , three different causes , in one - to - one correspondence with the quantities in eqn(2.1 ) , may be cited :    * the train changed length between the two measurements . *",
    "the observer s train , was moving at a different speed during the two measurements . *",
    "the clocks employed in the two measurements , one in the frame s , the other in the frame s , are running relatively fast ( or slow ) with respect to each other .",
    "if it now happens that one clock _ is _ running slower than the other , in the comparison of the measurements , the observer , o(slow ) , with the slower running clock , but unaware of this fact , has two possible ways to interpret the different measurement results on the basis of eqn(2.1 ) :    * the assumed speed is correct but the train was shorter during his measurement , than during that performed by the other observer , o(fast ) . *",
    "the train has the same length but appears to move faster for o(slow ) than for o(fast )    now if it is _ known _ , independently , both that the clock of o(slow ) does run slower than that of o(fast ) and that the train is the same length , only the interpretation ( b ) is possible . as will be seen in the following ,",
    "this is the correct prediction in special relativity for the case that the clock in the frame s runs slow , according to an observer at rest in the frame s , due to the time dilatation effect .",
    "hitherto the solution ( a ) relativistic ` length contraction ' has been taken as the prediction of special relativity .",
    "how this spurious result arises from misinterpretation of the space - time lorentz transformation will also be explained .",
    "the space - time lorentz transformation relates space and time measurements recorded , predicted or specified in different inertial frames . in its application to any given experiment , care must be taken to define the exact operational meanings of the space and time coordinates appearing in the transformation equations . in this connection , to avoid confusion , the mathematical symbols representing the coordinates must be such as to encode clearly the following essential information :    * the inertial frame in which the space or time measurements are actually performed .",
    "i.e. the frame of the observer in the experiment .",
    "* the frame in which the primary space - time events , that undergo lorentz transformation , are defined . *",
    "whether , in the experiment in which an object is moving between fixed points in an inertial frame , the observer is in the rest frame of such a ` travelling object ' , or in some other inertial frame .",
    "the distinction made in ( iii ) will be found to be of crucial importance for a correct understanding of the physics underlying time dilatation and the closely related ` twin paradox ' , as well as the _ modus operandi _ of ` photon clocks ' .    in order to furnish the information mentioned in the points ( i)-(iii ) above , the following nomenclature and notation for space and time coordinates",
    "is suggested :    _ subject frame _    ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) coordinates in observer s rest frame .",
    "_ object frame _    ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) coordinates in any inertial frame in motion relative to that of the observer .",
    "_ source frame _    ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) ; ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) frame in which primary space time events are specified i.e. events subjected to lorentz transformation .    _ target frame _    ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) ; ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) lorentz - transformed coordinates .    _ base frame _    ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) ; ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) coordinates specifying the position of an object ( ` travelling object ' ) moving between fixed points in an observer s frame .    _",
    "travelling frame _",
    "( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) ; ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) coordinates specifying outset and arrival events ( corresponding to fixed points in a base frame ) in the subject frame of a travelling object .",
    "it is important to note that physical predictions which change completely when base and travelling frames are exchanged , are , as will be seen , invariant with respect to exchange of source and target frames , i.e. to whether the lt or its inverse is used to perform the transformation .",
    "also physical predictions do not depend on whether a frame is considered to be a subject frame ( capitalised symbols ) or an object frame ( uncapitalised symbols ) .",
    "this is because the predictions do not depend on whether or not an observer is present to perceive them .",
    "the use of capitalised symbols is then optional , but may improve the clarity of equations .",
    "an example given below is the measurement of the lifetime of an unstable particle where measurements are performed uniquely in the laboratory ( subject ) frame in order to obtain a quantity defined in the rest frame ( object frame ) of the decaying particle .    in the following ,",
    "some applications are given to illustrate the use of the notation .",
    "consider an experiment where clocks @xmath26 and @xmath27 are placed at the origins , o and o of inertial frames s and s , where s moves in the frame s with speed @xmath28 along the common @xmath6-@xmath7 axis of the two frames .",
    "the subscript ` @xmath29 ' indicates that s is the base frame for the travelling clock @xmath27 so that @xmath30 .",
    "two , distinct , experiments are possible : @xmath27 is observed from s or @xmath26 is observed from s. if the observations are made in the frame s then the latter is the subject and base frame of the experiment and may be either the source or target frame for the lt .",
    "the former possibility is treated first , the other one will be considered below . for this",
    "the appropriate lt , relating the elapsed time @xmath31 to the corresponding time , @xmath32 recorded by @xmath26 , is : @xmath33 = 0 \\\\   { \\overline{t}}'({{\\rm c}}'_0 ) & = & \\gamma_b [ t({{\\rm c}}_0)_b-\\frac{v_b x({{\\rm c}}'_0)_b}{c^2 } ]           \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "these transformation equations require that when o and o are in spatial coincidence , @xmath35 , then @xmath36 . using ( 3.1 ) to eliminate @xmath37 from ( 3.2 ) gives immediately the time dilatation ( td ) relation : @xmath38 if , in the experiment with a _ reciprocal configuration _ , @xmath26 moves with speed -@xmath39 relative to @xmath27 along the positive @xmath7 axis , so that @xmath40 a similar calculation gives the td relation : .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the td relation for the experiment with a reciprocal configuration is obtained by exchange of primed and unprimed quantities throughout eqn(3.3 ) .",
    "an important feature of the td relations ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) is their manifest translational invariance no spatial coordinates appear in these equations .",
    "the physical meaning of td is that a uniformly moving clock ( @xmath27 in ( 3.3 ) ) is observed to run slower by the factor @xmath43 relative to an identical clock at rest ( @xmath26 in ( 3.3 ) ) , and this independantly of the spatial position of the clock . in an identical manner",
    "the clock @xmath26 is observed to run slower than @xmath27 by the factor @xmath43 when observed from s. this apparently contradictory behaviour shows that td is a subjective ( observer - dependent ) effect .",
    "the ` twin paradox ' , to be discussed below , arises from the attempt to relate , by the lt , the independent events in an experiment and the different experiment with a reciprocal configuration .",
    "if a second clock @xmath44 is at rest at @xmath45 in s its equation of motion in the frame s is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the separation of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in s. the space transformation equation for @xmath49 is given by : @xmath50 this equation satisfies simultaneously the intial condition @xmath51 and the equation of motion ( 3.5 ) .",
    "it also reduces to ( 3.1 ) in the case @xmath52 .",
    "the time transformation equation corresponding to ( 3.6 ) is @xmath53\\ ] ] when @xmath54 , then ( 3.6 ) gives @xmath55 , independently of the value of @xmath28 ; ( 3.1 ) gives @xmath56 and ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.7 ) give @xmath57 . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are therefore synchronised when @xmath54 .    using ( 3.5 ) to eliminate @xmath58 from ( 3.7 ) gives , analogously to ( 3.3 ) , the td relation : @xmath59 comparing ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.8 ) it can be seen that @xmath48 and @xmath49 remain synchronous for all values of @xmath60 : @xmath61 there is therefore no ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect for two synchronised clocks at different positions in the same inertial frame .",
    "that this must be so is already evident from the manifest translational invariance of the td relations ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.8 ) , that have no dependence on spatial coordinates . using a simplified notation ,",
    "if clock 1 in s is compared with clock 2 in s , and clock 3 in s is compared with clock 4 in s , where the spatial positions of all the clocks are arbitary , the corresponding td relations are : @xmath62 it follows from these equations that if @xmath63 then @xmath64 and _ vice versa _ clocks which are synchronous in s(s ) are also synchronous in s(s ) .    combining ( 3.1 ) with ( 3.3 ) and (",
    "3.6 ) with ( 3.8 ) gives the relations @xmath65 where @xmath66 .    in virtue of the identity @xmath67 ( 3.3),(3.12 ) and ( 3.8),(3.13 )",
    "are two pairs of parametic equations that specify hyperbolae in the cartesian space - time plot in the frame s. introducing a simplified notation : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the equations of these hyperbolae are @xmath73 consider now simultaneous events in s , e1 and e2 , on the world lines of @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that : @xmath74 the world lines of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in s and the events e1 and e2 are shown in fig .",
    "the transformed events in the frame s are shown in fig .",
    "1b , where the world lines of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath75 are drawn .",
    "also shown are are the hyperbolae ( 3.14 ) and ( 3.15 ) corresponding to the simultaneity condition ( 3.16 ) together with their intersections with the world lines of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath76 the world lines are identical to those in fig .",
    "1a , lying along the @xmath78 and @xmath79 axes .",
    "noting that with simultaneity condition ( 3.16 ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are functions only of @xmath82 , ( 3.14)-(3.16 ) give the relation : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is independent of @xmath82 .",
    "eqn ( 3.17 ) holds for all values of @xmath82 , in particular for @xmath85 when @xmath86 and @xmath87 so that @xmath88 as is also clear from inspection of fig .",
    "1b , the spatial separation of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a lorentz - invariant quantity there is no ` relativistic length contraction ' .",
    "how this spurious effect arises from misuse of the space - time lt is explained in section 6 below .    the td effect and the invariance of length intervals imply modification of the velocity reciprocity relation of galilean relativity , which may be stated as : @xmath89 the bar in the symbol @xmath90 denotes that , unlike @xmath28 , which is a fixed input parameter , the quantity is a derived one analogous the the transformed coordinates @xmath91 , @xmath92 . a similar notation is used below to classify other kinematical parameters . in galilean relativity @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "for an observer at rest in s ( a ` travelling ' observer if s is the base frame ) , @xmath95 becomes a subject frame interval .",
    "because of the invariance of length intervals , the relation @xmath93 holds also in special relativity , whereas , due to td , time intervals in s and s are related in a different manner than in galilean relativity : @xmath96 . combining these relations between infinitesimal intervals ,",
    "the reciprocity relation in special relativity therefore differs from ( 3.19 ) : @xmath97 so that @xmath98 as will be seen below , the relation ( 3.21 ) is crucial for understanding the correct solution of the twin paradox .",
    "consideration of the experiment , with a reciprocal configuration , in which s is the base frame and @xmath26 is the travelling object yields the following reciprocity relation : @xmath99 giving @xmath100 the relation ( 3.22 ) is obtained from ( 3.20 ) by exchange of primed and unprimed quantities followed by the operations @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "eqn(3.23 ) is related to ( 3.21 ) simply by exchange of primed and unprimed quantities .",
    "the addition of base frame velocities is first considered .",

    "it is interesting , in view of the discussion of ` photon clocks ' in the following section , to also consider the velocity transformations for an object moving in the x - y plane . introducing the @xmath6- and @xmath118-components of @xmath103 and @xmath104",

    "however _ this is not the case when experiments with reciprocal configurations are performed , i.e. when both subject and object and base and travelling frames are exchanged_. this point is crucial for the correct understanding of the ` twin paradox ' predictions for an experiment with a configuration reciprocal to the one just described are given by exchange of primed for unprimed quantities in the above equations and reversing the signs of all velocity parameters .",
    "hence , in the reciprocal configuration , the td relation ( 4.7 ) is replaced by @xmath236 and the velocity relation ( 4.12 ) by @xmath237 the relations ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.15 ) show that the ` reciprocity principle ' ( rp )  @xcite , mentioned in the introduction , which has hitherto been assumed to hold in both galilean and special relativity requires re - interpretation in special relativity .",
    "the rp states that :    * ( rp ) if the velocity of an inertial frame s relative to another such frame s is @xmath0 , then the velocity of s relative to s is @xmath1 . *",
    "the rp has hitherto , following einstein in ref .",
    "@xcite , been assumed to describe velocity observations in the frames s and s of a experiment in which events in the two frames are connected by the space - time lt .",
    "such a interpretation is evidently at variance with eqns,(4.12 ) and ( 4.15 ) .",
    "the corresponding principle in special relativity may be called the ` kinematical reciprocity principle ' ( krp ) :    * ( krp ) the velocity of an inertial frame s relative to an inertial frame s in primary space - time experiment is equal and opposite to the velocity of s relative to s in the reciprocal experiment . *    unlike the rp",
    ", the krp describes a relation between the kinematical configurations of two physically distinct experiments , not that between observations in two different frames in the same experiment , as in ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.15 ) . as will be seen below , although the events of a primary experiment are physically distinct ( not related by the space - time lt ) from those of the reciprocal experiment , the base frame kinematical configurations of a primary experiment and its reciprocal _ are _ related by a _ kinematical _ lt or the base frame velocity transformation formulae ( 5.6 ) and ( 5.7 ) above .",
    "the experiments yielding the td relations ( 4.7 ) and ( 4.14 ) may be described as having _",
    "reciprocal configurations_. in the case that the initial conditions of the experiment and the experiment with a reciprocal configuration are the same : @xmath238 and @xmath239 , identical predictions ( after exchange of primed and unprimed quantities ) are obtained for an experiment and its reciprocal , i.e. the clock c as viewed from s is slowed down by the same ratio in comparison to a clock at rest as when c when viewed from s. then the two experiments may be called _ reciprocal _ ones .",
    "it can now be seen that the krp is actually the _ definition _ of a reciprocal expriment , given some primary one , not some relation between observations in s and s for the primary experiment .",
    "conversely , if an experiment and its reciprocal give ( after exchange of primed and unprimed quantities ) identical results then necessarily @xmath238 .",
    "these predictions are summarised in the ` measurement reciprocity postulate ' ( mrp )  @xcite :    * ( mrp ) reciprocal space - time measurements of similar rulers and clocks at rest in two different inertial frames s , s , by observers at rest in s , s respectively , yield identical results . *    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the mrp , together with the requirement that the space - time transformation equations are single - valued functions of their arguments is sufficient to derive the lt ( 4.1)and(4.2 ) without consideration of any ` light signals ' i.e. independently of einstein s scond postulate .",
    "this type of derivation of the lt was first performed by ignatowsky in 1910  @xcite .",
    "the crucial point for the understanding of the twin paradox is that the experiment and its reciprocal are _ completely independent of each other_. thus the td relation ( 4.7 ) where the clock c is seen to run slower than c is an experiment performed by an observer at rest in s , while the td relation ( 4.14 ) where the clock c is seen to run slower than c is a different experiment performed by an observer at rest in s. because the experiments are different the question of any contradiction between the predictions for them can not , even in principle , arise .    in special relativity then , just as in quantum mechanics , the results of an experiment",
    "depend both on the _ a priori _ initial conditions and how , and by whom , the experiment is performed .",
    "the predictions of special relativity describe therefore not the properties of some abstract mathematical ` space - time ' as envisaged by minkowski  @xcite but the expected space - time measurements of some particular observer . in this respect thay",
    "are very similar to those of linear perspective for the perception of three - dimensional space , which is also intrinsically observer - dependent and based on the mathematics of projective geometry .",
    "in fact the td effect corresponds to a @xmath240 projection of the lt  @xcite .    without any further discussion , as in the following section , of the differential aging implicit in ( 4.7 ) and ( 4.12 ) on the one hand , or ( 4.14 ) and ( 4.15 ) on the other",
    ", it can already be seen that no paradox of self - contradiction can arise by comparison of the predictions for an experiment with those of a reciprocal one _ even if the same clocks with the same initial settings are used in both experiments_. the physical meaning of @xmath241 in ( 4.13 ) and @xmath242 in ( 4.14 ) , although both are time intervals recorded by the same clock , are completely different .",
    "indeed , setting @xmath243 and @xmath244 as in the generic lt equations ( 4.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) gives , instead of ( 4.13 ) and ( 4.14 ) , respectively : @xmath245 these equations require either that @xmath246 or that @xmath247 , i.e. @xmath248 , @xmath249 , in contradiction to the assumed initial condition of the experiment @xmath250 . in order to avoid this antimony",
    "it is essential that the base frame and travelling frame of both the experiment and its reciprocal be properly specified for the time intervals measured in each subject frame .",
    "however , as previously pointed out , the predictions for either an experiment or its reciprocal are invariant with respect to exchange of source and target frames .",
    "although an experiment and its reciprocal are completely independent concerning the space - time events occuring in either one or the other of them , it is important to note that the _ initial kinematical configurations _ of an experiment and its reciprocal _ are _ related by a kinematical ( momentum - energy ) lt . denoting by @xmath251 an element of proper time of the object o considered in eqns(3.24 ) and ( 3.25 ) above , these equations give , on dividing throughout by @xmath251 and multiplying throughout by the newtonian mass @xmath228 of the object , the lt of its momentum and energy : @xmath252 \\\\        e'({\\rm o } ) & = & \\gamma_b [ e({\\rm o})-v_b p({\\rm o } ) ]          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath253 and @xmath254 . multiplying ( 4.18 ) on both sides by @xmath255 and dividing by ( 4.19 )",

    "eqn(4.24 ) is the parallel velocity addition formula ( 3.28 ) . if @xmath259 then @xmath260 so that the object is at rest in s. the kinematical configuratations of a primary experiment with o at rest in s and its reciprocal where o moves with speed @xmath261 along the negative @xmath7-axis in s are therefore related by the kinematical lt ( 4.18 ) and ( 4.19 ) .    for a massive object ,",
    "the energy - momentum transformation equations ( 4.18 ) and ( 4.19 ) are equivalent to those : @xmath262 \\\\     u'_0 & = & \\gamma_b[u_0 -\\frac{v_b}{c}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of its 4-vector velocity : @xmath263 for a massless object ( for example a photon ) the 4-vector velocity is physically meaningless , as all its components are infinite , but the the momentum - energy transformations ( 4.18 ) and ( 4.19 ) and the base frame velocity addition formula ( 3.28 ) or ( 4.24 ) remain valid .",
    "this is because both @xmath264 and @xmath265 remain finite in the limit @xmath266 , @xmath267 @xmath268 as a consequence of the relation @xmath269  @xcite .",
    "before entering into a more detailed discussion of the differential aging effect ( dae ) that is the basis for the correct understanding of the twin paradox a simple space - time experiment is described in which the dae is both manifest and experimentally verified .",
    "this is not merely a thought experiment , impossible to realise in practice , but a description of the space - time physics that actually governs the use of high energy secondary beams of unstable particles .",
    "the busy reader need read only this account to be convinced of the physical reality of the dae effect .",
    "the ` clocks ' in the experiment are @xmath270 mesons which are created at the same time , in the same event by the collision of a high energy ( several gev ) extracted proton beam with a proton at rest in a hydrogen target .",
    "one charged pion , @xmath271 , ( analogous to a clock at rest in the base ( b ) frame ) , produced by fragmentation of the target proton , is produced with a very low momentum , loses energy rapidly by ionisation of the liquid hydrogen and comes to rest in the target within a short time @xmath272ns , that may be neglected in the following considerations .",
    "the other charged pion @xmath273 , ( analogous to a clock at rest in the travelling ( t ) frame ) produced by fragmentation of the beam proton has an energy of 2.8 gev , corresponding to a speed in the laboratory ( base ) frame of @xmath274 or @xmath275 .",
    "it travels almost parallel to the initial proton beam over a distance of 100 m where 334ns later , in the laboratory frame , it collides elastically , head - on , with another @xmath270 at rest in a stopping target ( unlikely , but certainly physically possible ) and itself comes to rest in the laboratory frame .",
    "according to the nomenclature and notation of section 3 , the subject , source and base frame , s , of the experiment is that of the laboratory where @xmath271 represents a clock at rest , while the object , target and travelling frame , s , is the rest frame of @xmath273 . according to the td relation ( 4.7 ) the elapsed time in the rest frame of @xmath273 is : @xmath276 since the mean decay lifetime of a charged pion is 26ns the probability that @xmath273 will survive to be scattered back into the laboratory system is large : @xmath277 = 0.53 $ ] .",
    "it may be said that @xmath273 is only ` middle aged ' at the time it scatters into the laboratory frame .",
    "however the probability that @xmath271 a twin of @xmath273 , born at the same instant is still in existence @xmath278 334 ns after it is created is only @xmath279 = 2.7 \\times 10^{-6}$ ] . if the 26ns mean lifetime of a charged pion is compared to a human lifetime of 70yr , then @xmath273 is only 45 years old on arriving in the laboratory frame after its travels , whereas @xmath271 will , at this instant , have been dead and buried for 827yr!. since high energy pion beams have been used to perform experiments hundreds of metres from their production point in particle physics laboratories all over the world there can be no doubt of the correctness of the above account , i.e. of the reality of the dae . indeed , the td effect has been quantitatively confirmed by observations of the decay of beam pions  @xcite .    to give more insight into the dae and its relation to discussions of the twin paradox that have appeared in text books and the pedagogical literature , a more elaborate thought experiment , inspired by the simple one involving a charged pion just described , is now presented . to understand the role ( if any ) of acceleration in the dae and the twin paradox it is convenient to introduce macroscopic objects that can , by analogy with the charged pion in the above experiment , undergo head - on elastic collisions and so be transfered , with negligible time delay , between two inertial frames .",
    "these objects may be called sbs for ` space billiards ' . like ideal billiard balls undergoing perfectly elastic collisions",
    ", they are reduced to a state of rest when colliding frontally with an identical object initially at rest .",
    "the sbs are assumed to move freely in field - free space , without rotation , according to newton s first law of motion .",
    "it will also be found convenient , following the original suggestion of langevin  @xcite , to dope certain of the sbs with a radioactive substance with a suitably chosen mean decay lifetime , @xmath280 .",
    "the age , @xmath281 of such an sb is then in one - to - one correspondence with the number @xmath282 of undecayed radiactive nuclei remaining at any instant , according to the relation , expressing the exponential decay law : @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the initial number of radioacive nuclei .",
    "the age difference of two such identically - prepared sbs is then given by the ratio of their activities , @xmath285 , ( number of radioactive decays per unit time ) as measured at the same instant by two identical detectors : @xmath286    in the proposed experiment , identical doped sbs are prepared at rest in the subject , source , and base frame , s. by elastic collisions with other , identical , moving , sbs , they are then projected into the object , target and travelling frame s. finally by further elastic collisions with identical sbs at rest in s they are projected back into this frame , and their ages are compared to those of a similar sb that remained at rest in s during their journey .",
    "thus , instead of the round - trip scenario of the classical twin paradox , only the outward journey is considered .",
    "because of the symmetry of outward and return journeys , both with respect to accelerations , decelerations , and times of passage , this simplification does not affect in any way the connection between the dae observed and the resolution of the round - trip twin paradox . also , the analysis of the acceleration - free sections of the journey is identical to that in the conventional twin paradox experiment where the travelling twin may be accelerated and decelerated during non - neglible proper time intervals . since the stay - at - home twin ( see below ) undergoes identical acceleration and deceleration as the travelling twin , but has a negligibly short interval of uniform motion , the effect of acceleration and deceleration cancels completely in the calculation of the dae , and so can not be responsible for it .    as shown in fig .",

    "and so with the same age according to eq .",

    "the sb b0 , which will constitute the clock at rest in the frame s , ( the analogue of the stay - at - home twin ) is separated from t0 by a short distance ( not shown ) that is much less than @xmath47 , but sufficiently large that b0 attains a uniform speed after its collision ( see below ) with p0 .",
    "the sbs t0 , t1 and t2 are set in motion by synchronous frontal elastic collisions with p0 , p1 and p2 which each move with uniform speed @xmath28 parallel to the @xmath6-axis ( see fig .",
    "5b ) . whereas t1 and t2 ( the analogues of the travelling twin ) are set in motion directly by collisions with p1 and p2 , p0 first collides with b0 , that after a negligibly small displacement collides with t0 , setting it in motion and itself coming to rest .",
    "since t1 and t2 are later brought to rest in s by elastic collisions with b1 and b2 respectively , identical accelerations and decelerations are undergone by b0 , t1 and t2 so completely cancelling their contributions to the dae when comparing the age of b0 with that of t1 or t2 .",
    "the collisions of t1 with b1 and t2 with b2 occur , as shown fig .",
    "5c , at @xmath287 in the frame s. the s frame configurations corresponding to figs . 5a , 5b and 5c , calculated using eqns .",

    "the spatial configurations in figs .",
    "5d , 5e and 5f are identical to those in figs .",
    "5a , 5b and 5c respectively .",
    "however , after the collisions with p0 , p1 and p2 , b0 , b1 and b2 all move to the left with the speed @xmath288 . it can be seen that the collisions of t1 with b1 and of t2 with b2 that project t1 and t2 back into the frame s , where their ages may be compared with that of b0 , occur simultaneously in both s and s consistent with eqs .",
    "( 3.9)-(3.11 ) above .",
    "if now the ages of the travelling sbs t1 and t2 are compared with that of the stay - at - home sb t0 , by measuring their activities in similar detectors at some later fixed time , special relativity predicts the dae : @xmath289    note that the reduced the age increments of t1 and t2 in the frame s , as compared to that of b0 in the frame s , are due to the increase of the apparent velocity of t1 relative to b1 and t2 relative to b2 in the frame s : @xmath288 , as compared to @xmath28 in the frame s , the journey being of equal length in the two frames . in the hitherto conventional interpretation , to be discussed below , the relative velocity is assumed to be @xmath28 in both s and s , and the spatial separations in the frame s are scaled down by a factor @xmath43 , so that the reduced age increments of t1 and t2 in s are explained by length contraction  a shorter journey than in s at the same speed .",
    "thus the solution ( a ) corresponding to measurement of the length of a train , as discussed in section 2 , is adopted , rather than solution ( b ) corresponding to the configurations shown in fig .",

    "the reciprocal experiment is shown in fig .",
    "7 . in this case , s , the charged pion rest frame is the subject , source and base frame while the laboratory frame s ( the proton rest frame ) is object , target and travelling frame . in this case",
    "the proton with which @xmath290 can potentially interact is the travelling object . in spite of the kinematical and spatial similarity of the initial states in the primary and reciprocal experiments it is essentially impossible that the charge exchange reaction can occur in the reciprocal experiment .",
    "typically the pion will decay after a time @xmath292ns , ( fig .",

    "since the local clock at u is synchronised with the local clock at r and therefore measures r s age , there are only two times in the problem : @xmath13 , which is the proper time of r , equal to his age increment during t s journey , and @xmath431 the proper time of t , equal to his age increment during his journey , which is equal to @xmath432 on the outward and equal to @xmath433 on the return journey .",

    "of particular importance for the correct resolution of the twin paradox is the case where observers in two different inertial frames , with clocks running at different rates , compare their estimations of the length of the train .    in section 3",
    "a general nomenclature and notation for an unambigous description of different space - time experiments is introduced .",
    "the most important novel concepts are those of a ` base frame ' and a ` travelling frame ' .",

    "the primary experiment is that in which s is the base frame and s the travelling frame . assuming that s moves along the @xmath451-axis in s , then in an experiment with a reciprocal configuration , s is the base frame and s is a travelling frame moving with speed @xmath39 along the negative @xmath451-axis in s. if @xmath238 the latter experiment is said to be the reciprocal of the former and _ vice versa_. crucial for the correct interpretation of the twin paradox is that the primary experiment and its reciprocal are _ physically independent _ in",
    "particular the base frame space - time coordinates in the primary experiment and its reciprocal are not connected by the space - time lt .",
    "it is the false assumption that this is the case which underlies the spurious ` standard resolution ' of the paradox discussed in section 6 .",
    "however , base frame velocity , or energy - momentum configurations in an experiment and its reciprocal are connected by the kinematical ( energy - momentum ) lt or the base frame velocity addition formula ( 3.28 ) .",
    "other less important attributes of inertial frames introduced in section 3 are ` subject ' and ` object ' frames specifying in which frames observations or measurements are made or predicted and ` source ' or ` target ' frames i.e. whether a lt or an inverse lt is used to relate space and time coordinates in different inertial frames .",
    "all physical predictions are independent of whether a frame is classified as ` subject ' or ` object ' or by exchange of ` source ' and ` target ' frames .",

    "the twin paradox is discussed at length in section 5 by analysing three different , but related , thought experiments in each of which the periods of acceleration or deceleration are negligibly short in comparison with periods of uniform motion . in these analyses the nomenclature and notation introduced in section 3 is systematically applied . in the first experiment ,",
    "the stay - at - home twin is identified with a charged pion , created in a high energy interaction , that is slow and comes rapidly to rest in the production target .",
    "the travelling twin is identified with another charged pion , created in the same event , but with high energy , that travels a distance of 100 m before colliding head - on elastically with another charged pion at rest , which projects it into the same rest - frame as its stay - at - home sibling . in this example",
    "the decay lifetimes of the pions measure their age and make manifest the differential aging effect the age of the travelling pion when it is projected into the lab frame is much less than that of its stay - at - home sibling .",
    "the second experiment is similar to the first except that the pions are replaced by macroscopic objects : ` space billiards ' doped with a radioactive substance serving as an internal clock to measure their age .",
    "they are projected into and out of the travelling frame s by head - on elastic collisions with identical space billiards .",
    "the analysis of the experiment shows that the physical phenomenon underlying the experiment is the relative velocity transformation formula derived in section 3 if the speed of the space billiard is @xmath28 in the base frame s , it is @xmath452 in the travelling frame s. the third experiment is a variation of the first in which a travelling @xmath453 induces the process : @xmath454 .",
    "the comparison of this primary experiment with its reciprocal , in which the @xmath453 remains a rest and the proton is in motion , makes clear the physical independence of the two experiments .    in section 6 the ` space billiard ' experiment of section 5 is analysed according to the standard solution of the twin paradox where the dae is found to be a consequence of a spurious ` length contraction ' effect resulting from misinterpretation of the lt as explained in refs  @xcite and recalled in section 7 of the present paper .",
    "absurd consequences of the standard solution times of events in the travelling frame changing when a different arbitary choice os apatial coordinate system is made in the base frame , and abrupt ( positive or negative ) age changes of an object during rapid acceleration or deceleration are pointed out .    in section 7 the dae in the twin paradox experiment is discussed in relation the minkowski space - time plot . in this connection",
    "minkowski s original sign error when drawing the direction of the axes of space and time coordinates in the travelling frame s , pointed out in a recent paper by the present author  @xcite , is important .",
    "this error remained uncorrected in all discussions of the twin paradox employing the minkowski plot .",
    "apart from this geometrical error , the fallacy in the standard minkowski plot analysis of the twin paradox is the incorrect assumption that the td effect of the physically independent reciprocal experiment is applicable in the primary experiment when the travelling twin observes the clock of her stay - at - home brother .",
    "actually , as is obvious from inspection of the inverse lt for the primary experiment , the clock of the stay - at - home twin is observed to run faster ( not slower , as in the reciprocal experiment ) by the travelling twin . that this is the case is made perfectly clear by inspection of eqns.(7.23)-(7.30 ) .",
    "the twin paradox arises because of an apparent symmetry between configurations where the twin r is at rest and the twin t is in motion or the twin t is at rest and and the twin r is in motion .",
    "if only the relative motion of t and r is of physical significance the existence of such a symmetry appears to be well - founded . in the standard solution ,",
    "the symmetry is broken by assuming the same relative velocity in the base and travelling frames but introducing ` length contraction ' of the spatial separation of the two twins ( only while they are in relative motion ) in the frame of the travelling twin . in the correct solution",
    "the spatial separation between the twins is the same at all corresponding instants in the base and travelling frames , but their relative velocity is different in the two frames .",
    "the physical basis of the symmetry breaking is the td effect itself a moving clock is seen to run slow in comparison with an identical clock at rest in the observer s frame .",
    "the erroneous nature of the standard solution , in which r s clock is calculated to run slow when observed by t , results from the false identification of a configuration from the physically independent reciprocal experiment with an inverse transformation of the primary experiment .    that the primary and reciprocal experiments _ are _ physically independent has been previously pointed out in the literature .",
    "builder  @xcite made the essential point that the lt in the primary experiment where @xmath455 and @xmath435 is not the same ( i.e. the space and time coordinate symbols have a different physical meaning ) as the lt of the reciprocal experiment where @xmath456 and @xmath457 . builder also correctly stated that identical results are obtained by using ( in either the primary or reciprocal experiment ) the lt or its inverse that is , in the primary experiment r s clock will be observed by t to run faster than her own , not slower , as in the standard solution . in spite of this ,",
    "builder subsequently erroneously confused the base frame configuation of the reciprocal experiment with the travelling frame configuration of the primary experiment as described abov  @xcite .",
    "another author who pointed out clearly the independence of the primary and reciprocal experiments was max born . without considering the operational meaning of the coordinate symbols in the lt ,",
    "dingle  @xcite had noticed the antinomy similar to that of eqns(4.16 ) and ( 4.17 ) above and concluded that the whole of special relativity theory is excluded by _",
    "reductio ad absurdum_. in his response  @xcite to dingle s direct request for comments , born made the same correct observation as builder in one case @xmath455 and @xmath435 , in the other @xmath456 and @xmath457 so the symbols in the lt refer in the two cases to physically distinct experiments .",
    "to the present writer s best knowledge , only one author  @xcite stated clearly in the published literature that the standard application of the generic lt ( as the entries of tables 1 and 2 and shown on the clocks with round dials in figs . 9 and 11 above ) does not correctly give the age of the travelling twin , as calculated by the td relation , and shown on the clocks with square dials in figs .",
    "a clear distinction was drawn between the age of the travelling twins and the times indicated by ` synchronised ' clocks but it was not pointed out that the latter are devoid of any physical meaning indeed as shown in section 6 above correspond to patently absurd predictions .",
    "qualitatively similar remarks to those in ref .",
    "@xcite are found at  @xcite .",
    "many authors state , incorrectly , that the source if the asymmetry between the stay - at - home and travelling twins is that the travelling twin is accelerated and decelerated , and therefore changes inertial frames , whereas the other stays always in the same inertial frame . in the space - billiard experiment described in section 5 above",
    ", the objects equivalent to r and t undergo identical acceleration and decleration programs , but the travelling object still ages less than the stay - at - home one .",
    "langevin  @xcite stated , correctly , that an inertial path linking two time - like separated space time points corresponds to a maximum of the proper time integral between the two points , but incorrectly that this fact explains the dae in the twin paradox experiment .",
    "indeed in the ` three brothers ' version of the twin paradox due to lord halsbury  @xcite , described by marder  @xcite , where the clock setting of the brother moving away from the earth is transfered at the distant star to his brother moving towards the earth at the same speed , the same global dae effect occurs and no acceleration of deceleration occurs in the problem .",
    "other author s  @xcite following tolman  @xcite have used the equivalence principle of general relativity to replace a constant proper frame acceleration of the travelling twin by an artificial ` gravitational field ' in the instantaneous rest frame of this twin .",
    "however all these authors made the same error of confusing the base frame of the reciprocal experiment with the travelling frame of the primary experiment , explained above in section 7 , when considering the phases of uniform motion of the round trip .",
    "applying occam s razor retaining only what is essential the present paper has not addressed the case of non - impulsive accelerations and decelerations , or the interesting analysis initiated by langevin  @xcite of exchange of light signals between the the twins during the voyage . since , in the explanation of the dae in the twin paradox given above , the acceleration and decleration phases of the motion play no role , the first restriction is of no importance for understanding the resolution of the twin paradox .",
