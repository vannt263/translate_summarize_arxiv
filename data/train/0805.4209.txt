    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binaries in which the primary , a white dwarf ( wd ) , accretes matter and angular momentum from the secondary , a main sequence star , filling its roche - lobe .",
    "the matter is transferred by means of either an accretion disk around the wd , or an accretion column , when the wd has a strong ( @xmath4 mg ) magnetic field .",
    "ongoing accretion at a low rate ( quiescence ) is interrupted every few weeks to months by intense accretion ( outburst ) of days to weeks ( a dwarf nova accretion event ) , and every few thousand years by a thermonuclear explosion ( tnr ; the classical nova event ) .",
    "cv systems are divided into sub - classes according to the duration , occurrence and amplitude of their outburst : dwarf novae ( dn ) are found mostly in the low state ; while nova - likes ( nl ) exhibit the spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of novae between or after outbursts but have never had a recorded outburst .",
    "nls form a less homogeneous class and are divided into sub - types depending on certain properties , such eclipsing systems , magnetic systems , or systems that go into unexpected low states @xcite .",
    "non - magnetic nls can be divided into ux uma systems which remain in a high optical brightness state or `` permanent outburst state '' , and the vy scl systems ( anti - dwarf novae ) which experience unexpected low states when the optical brightness plummets .",
    "cvs are believed to evolve from long period ( @xmath52 day ) toward short period ( @xmath31 hour ) as the mass ratio @xmath6 decreases , crossing the 23 hour period gap , where few system are found .",
    "theory predicts that the period of those systems having a sufficiently low @xmath6 will increase as @xmath6 continues to decrease , the so - called period bouncers @xcite . the driving mechanism behind the mass transfer ( @xmath7 ) and hence , the evolution of cvs is believed to be angular momentum loss , dominated by magnetic stellar wind braking at periods above 3 hours and by gravitational wave emission below this period .",
    "the secondaries are stripped to @xmath8 on a timescale of only 1 - 4 gyr after they form as close binaries above the gap .",
    "consequently , in the lifetime of the galaxy , the vast majority of cvs should have evolved to a period minimum near 80 min and now have degenerate brown dwarf - like secondaries @xcite .",
    "however , recent models @xcite suggest ( i ) much lower angular momentum loss rates , so it takes 10 - 12 gyr to even reach a 3 hr period , and ( ii ) multiple evolutionary tracks yielding different populations of cvs above and below the 3 hour orbital period .    the accretion disks and underlying accreting wds in cvs can provide crucial clues and constraints on these evolutionary scenarios .",
    "it is important to derive @xmath7 from observations , as the mass transfer rate are tied to the angular momentum loss . as to the wds , they are the central engines of the observed outbursts , either as potential wells for the release of accretional energy or as the sites of explosive tnr shell burning . in addition , the differences between the temperatures , rotation , and chemical abundances of cv wds and single isolated wds provide clues as to the effects of accretion , diffusion , and long term heating and evolution @xcite .    with a wavelength range from 9051187 , _ fuse _",
    "covers that part of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectrum where the hotter cv component is dominant . for nova - likes , the dominant component in the _ fuse _",
    "range is usually the accretion disk .",
    "additional possible components are the hot white dwarf , the boundary layer or accretion belt , and other hot regions on or close to the wd .",
    "many cv fuv spectra are modeled with 2 components , usually a wd plus a disk . for each system ,",
    "one usually derives from the _ fuse _ spectrum the temperature of the wd ( @xmath9 ) , the gravity , the rotational velocity ( @xmath10 ) , the chemical abundances , the mass accretion rate , the inclination , and the distance to the system .",
    "it has therefore been very important to try and obtain _ fuse _ data for more cv systems in order to populate the @xmath9-period and the @xmath7-period parameter spaces .",
    "there is a need to enlarge the sample to obtain an accurate global picture of the systems above and below the period gap .",
    "for that reason , we proposed to observe with _ fuse _ of a set of 16 high declination dwarf novae ( our cycle 7 survey of dne ) and 16 high declination nova - likes ( our cycle 8 survey of nls - all chosen from the on - line cv catalog of downes _",
    "et al . _ ) . unfortunately ,",
    "our _ fuse _ nl survey was cut short due to the fatal failure of the reaction wheel of the telescope .",
    "of the 16 targets , only two were observed : bb dor and p831 - 57 .",
    "the analysis of the _ fuse _ spectrum of p831 - 57 is presented elsewhere @xcite . in this work we present the result of the _ fuse _ spectroscopic analysis of bb dor .",
    "bb dor ( also known as ec 05287 - 5847 , an object from the edingburgh - cape survey @xcite ) was spectroscopically identified as a cv in december 1987 and was seen fainter than @xmath11 until november 1992 @xcite . since that time it seems to be in bright state ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "a first ( extremely uncertain ) estimate of its period by @xcite put it right in the middle of the period gap with a period of 0.107 day or 2.57 h. however , a 45 day coverage @xcite corrected this value to 0.14923 d or 3.58 h , as expected for vy scl stars which usually have periods between @xmath13 and @xmath14 h. bb dor exhibits superhumps with a period excess of @xmath159.4% @xcite  it has the largest known fractional superhump of all systems and therefore provides a calibrating point at large @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "bb dor is a vy scl nova - like and so far no magnetic activity has been found .",
    "the system also exhibits quasi - periodic oscillations @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noted that due to its very narrow balmer lines ( with wings extending @xmath17km@xmath18s@xmath19 from the line center ) bb dor is most likely a low - inclination system . from the austral variable star observer network ( avson ) , it appears that bb dor has been around @xmath20 mag ( with an error @xmath21 mag ) for the last couple of years and can vary as much as 0.4 mag within one hour .",
    "the reddening value e(b - v ) towards bb dor is not known .",
    "however , the galactic reddening value in the direction of bb dor as inferred from the 100@xmath22 dust emission map @xcite is very small : e(b - v)=@xmath30.03 .",
    "since the dust map gives the maximum dust extinction , we deduce that bb dor must have a negligible reddening ( @xmath23 at most ) which should not affect the results ; consequently we do not deredden its _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "bb doradus was observed with _ fuse _ on 09 july 2007 at 02h51m09s ( ut ) , and 3 exposures were obtained ( h9030301 - exposures 001 , 002 , 003 ) . the _ fuse _ spectrum was obtained through the low resolution ( lwrs ; 30``x30 '' ) aperture in time tag mode .",
    "the data were processed with the last and final version of calfuse v3.2.0 @xcite .",
    "a look at the count rate graph ( generated by calfuse ) indicates that the data for each exposure were collected mainly during the first 1000 s , followed by a jitter lasting about 1,500 s. toward the end of each exposure , the count rate dropped to zero .",
    "therefore , while the co - added exposures for the 8 individual segments after processing by calfuse give a good exposure time ( _ after screening _ ) of between about 8750 s ( segments 1 ) and 9750 s ( segments 2 ) , the count rate plot indicates that the total _ good collection time _ ranges between 3350 s ( segments 1 ) and 3650 s ( segments 2 ) .",
    "we therefore weighted these segments accordingly , multiplying the flux ( of the order of @xmath24ergs@xmath18s@xmath19@xmath25@xmath19 in the on - line _ preview _ ) by a factor of 2.61 ( segments 1 ) and 2.67 ( segments 2 ) .",
    "after that we processed the data as usual ( see below ) .",
    "the spectral regions covered by the spectral channels overlap , and these overlap regions are then used to scale the spectra in the sic1 , sic2 , and lif2 channels to the flux in the lif1 channel",
    ". the low sensitivity portions ( usually the edges ) of each channel are discarded . in the present case",
    "the sic2b spectral segment was very noisy and we discarded it too .",
    "we also carried out a visual inspection of the _ fuse _ channels to locate the worm and we _ manually _ discarded these portions of the spectrum affected by the worm .",
    "we combine the individual exposures and channels to create a time - averaged spectrum weighting the flux in each output datum by the exposure time and sensitivity of the input exposure and channel of origin .",
    "the final product is a spectrum that covers the full _ fuse _ wavelength range @xmath26 . because we disregarded the right edge of both the sic1a and sic2b segments ,",
    "there is a gap between the lif1a and lif2b segments ( @xmath27  @xmath28 ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of bb dor is shown in figure 1 .",
    "note that the _ fuse _ exposures of bb dor consist entirely of observations carried out during the day .",
    "the small night exposure was ignored because of jitters and other problems .",
    "we suspect that most of the emission lines are due to helio- and geo - coronal emissions .      the _ fuse _ spectra of cvs exhibit mainly broad absorption lines from the accretion disk and wd , as well as sharp absorption lines from circumstellar ( or circumbinary ) material and the ism .",
    "emission lines from the hotter regions are usually broadened , depending on the inclination angle @xmath29 , due to the large keplerian velocity in the inner disk .",
    "sharp emission lines from air glow ( geo- and helio - coronal in origin ) are also present , due mainly to the reverberation of sunlight inside the _ fuse _ telescope during day time observations .",

    "absorption features from the higher orders of the lyman series are also clearly visible , indicating a temperature t@xmath31k .",
    "the other main absorption features expected at this temperature are the ciii ( 1175  ) , siiii ( @xmath3211081114  and @xmath3211401144 ) , siiv ( @xmath3211201130 ) and the cii ( 1010 ) .",

    "the siv ( 1006 ) , cii ( 1010 ) , and siv ( 1099 ) absorption multiplets are all unresolved and shallow .",
    "however , we have indicated them on the figures , as they appear deeper in the modeling . on the other side the siv ( 1063  & 1073 ) and siiii ( @xmath33 ) absorption lines appear deeper in the observed spectrum than in the modeling .",
    "the presence of the high - order ionization species ( such as the oxygen doublet ) indicates the presence of a hotter absorbing component above the main fuv emitting region .",
    "the pii line ( @xmath3961 ) has been marked in the spectrum , though it is most probably a feature due to the noise .",
    "all the the lines are listed in table 1 with their wavelengths .",
    "most of the broad absorption lines and features associated with the source are redshifted by about 0.6 - 0.9 , corresponding to a receding velocity of @xmath34km@xmath18s@xmath19 .",
    "it seems very likely that this redshif is due to the orbital motion of the wd , however , we do not have enough time tag data to verify this assumption .    [",

    "some of these lines seems to be due to helio - coronal emission ( sunlight reflected inside the telescope ) that contaminates the sic channels , in particular the hi lines , the hei & heii lines , the ciii ( 977 ) line , and the ovi doublet .",
    "the segments of the spectrum from the lif channels overlapping the sic channels down to about 1000  do not show any oxygen lines , and we therefore did not include these spectral regions of the sic channels .",
    "however , other emission lines may be solely from the source . in many nls ,",
    "the emission lines from the disk are broadened by the keplerian velocity and are consequently easily identified .",
    "however , @xcite have detected very narrow balmer lines and concluded that bb dor is most likely a low - inclination system .",
    "because of this , the identification of the emission lines from the source is not trivial .",
    "this issue is further complicated by the lack of night exposure and the very low signal - to - noise ratio , which makes it difficult to analyze the _ two - dimensional image _ of the spectrum for the effect of scattered sunlight on the emission lines .",
    "since the system is a nl in a high state , we expect at first the niv ( @xmath32923 ) , svi ( 933.5 & 944.5  ) , and ciii ( 977 ) emission lines to be from the source with some possible helio - coronal contamination mostly affecting the carbon emission lines .",
    "the niv ( 923.06 ) emission line is contaminated with the hi ( 923.15 ) line ; the niv ( 922.52  + 924.28 ) lines are not .",
    "however , the complete absence of narrow emission lines from the oxygen doublet and the ciii ( 1175 ) seems to indicate otherwise  i.e. all the sharp emission lines might be helio - coronal in origin . to further check this possibility we measured the narrow emission line relative intensities below 1000and compared with those of the solar spectrum @xcite .",
    "we found a good agreement with the solar - disk average quiet sun data , except for the svi 944.5 which has a higher relative intensity in the spectrum of bb dor .",
    "this could be due sun spot activity during the fuse observation of bb dor , as this line intensity increases by a factor of 30 inside sun spots while the other lines increase at most by a factor 3 .",
    "we therefore conclude that all the sharp emission lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum of bb dor are due to sun light reflected inside the telescope .",
    "we created a grid of models of synthetic spectra of wds and accretion disks for different values of the wd temperature @xmath9 , gravity @xmath35 , projected rotational velocity @xmath36 , inclination @xmath29 , mass accretion rate @xmath7 , and abundances .",
    "we then ran a @xmath37 fitting program to find the best fit for ( i ) a single wd component , ( ii ) a single accretion disk component , and ( iii ) a combined wd + accretion disk .",
    "we describe how we generate these synthetic spectra and how we perform the fitting .",
    "we create the synthetic model spectra for high - gravity stellar atmospheres using codes tlusty and synspec @xcite .",
    "atmospheric structure is computed ( using tlusty ) assuming a h - he lte atmosphere ; the other species are then added in the spectrum synthesis stage using synspec .",
    "we generate photospheric models with effective temperatures ranging from @xmath320,00050,000 k in increments of 1,000 k. we chose values of @xmath35 ranging between 7.5 and 9.0 .",
    "we also varied the stellar rotational velocity @xmath38 from @xmath39km@xmath18s@xmath19 to @xmath40km@xmath18s@xmath19 in steps of @xmath39km@xmath18s@xmath19 ( or smaller if needed ) .",
    "the wd rotation ( @xmath38 ) rate is determined by fitting the wd model to the spectrum while paying careful attention to the line profiles in the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "we do not carry out separate fits to individual lines but rather try to fit the lines and continuum simultaneously while paying careful attention to the absorption lines .",
    "it is important to note that the depth of the absorption features depends not only on the abundances but also on the rotational velocity .",
    "increasing the rotational velocity reduces the central depths of the absoption features , thus reducing the abundance . however , the widths of the absorption features also increase with increasing rotational velocity . as a consequence , abundances and rotational velocity effects",
    "are interwined and can not always be easily separated without additional information on either parameter .",
    "for any wd mass there is a corresponding radius , or equivalently one single value of @xmath35 ( e.g. see the mass radius relation from @xcite , or see @xcite for different composition and non - zero temperature wds ) .",
    "therefore , by scaling the theoretical spectrum to the observed one , we obtain the distance to the system .",
    "we model accretion disk spectra by first assuming that the disk is made of a collection of annuli , where each annulus has a temperature @xmath41 and gravity @xmath42 given by the standard disk model @xcite , for a given central mass @xmath43 and accretion rate @xmath7 .",
    "a variant of the code tlusty is then used , tldisk , that generates an atmosphere model for each annuli that is then used as input for the code synspec .",
    "the contribution of all the annuli are then combined using the code disksyn , and a final spectrum is obtained for any given inclination angle .",
    "a detailed explanation of the procedure is given in @xcite .",
    "in the present work we do not use the grid of synthetic accretion disk spectra tabulated by @xcite , instead we generate them .",
    "this allows us to compute disk spectra assuming non - solar abundances and for any inclination angle ( the disk spectra of @xcite have solar abundances and have been generated for given value of the inclination @xmath29 ) .    before carrying out a synthetic spectral fit of the spectra , we masked portions of the spectra with strong emission lines , strong ism absorption lines , detector noise , and air glow .",
    "the regions excluded from the fit are in blue in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "after having generated grids of models for the _ fuse _ spectrum of bb dor , we use fit @xcite , a @xmath37 minimization routine , to compute the reduced @xmath44 ( @xmath37 per number of degrees of freedom ) and scale factor ( which gives the distance ) for each model fit . while we use a @xmath37 minimization technique ,",
    "we do not blindly select the least @xmath37 models , but we also examine the models that best fit some of the features such as absorption lines and , when possible , the slope of the wings of the broad lyman absorption features .",
    "initially we generate solar abundances models , and when a good fit is found , we start varying the chemical abundances of c , n , s and si , to fit the absorption features of the spectrum . in particular ,",
    "the carbon abundance was set using the cii ( 1010 ) and ciii ( 1175 ) multiplets ; the sulfur abundance was set using the siv ( 1063  & 1073 ) lines ; and the silicon was set using the siiv ( 1067  , 1023  , 1028 ) and siiii ( @xmath31110  , @xmath321138 - 1146 ) lines .",
    "the data obtained by the avson implies that bb dor has been in a high state around @xmath20 for the last couple of years .",
    "we therefore expect the _ fuse _ spectrum to be dominated by flux from the accretion disk with a relatively high @xmath7 .",
    "however , in our modeling we follow a systematic approach which consists in fitting the following : ( i ) a single wd ; ( ii ) a single accretion disk ; and ( iii ) a wd + accretion disk composite .",
    "since we do not have any information on the mass of the wd , we look for all the best - fit models in the @xmath35 versus @xmath9 plane .",
    "namely , for each assumed value of @xmath35 we vary the temperature to find the best - fit model .",
    "as expected we find that the temperature is somewhere between 34,000k ( for @xmath45 ) and 40,000k ( for @xmath46 ) , with a distance between 377 pc and 135 pc , respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the least @xmath47 is obtained for @xmath48 .",
    "we chose the intermediate value @xmath49 model , with t=37,000k and d=247 pc and solar abundances , to illustrate our results in figure 1 .",
    "we then further improve the fit by varying the abundances .",
    "we find that in order to better fit the sulfur and silicon lines , we have to set the sulfur to 20 times its solar abundance , and the silicon to 3 times , while all the other species are kept at solar abundances .",
    "the @xmath47 value decreases from 0.3348 to 0.3129 ( by about 7% ) . while some of the lines are better fitted ( such as siv 1063  & 1073 ; siiii @xmath31010  & siiv @xmath31025 ) , the siv ( 1006  & 1100 ) are far too deep ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "next , we fit the solar abundances disk models .",
    "we find that a low inclination is needed in order to match the absorption lines , and in our models we initially set @xmath29=5 , 8 , 12 , and 18 degrees .",
    "again , because we have no information on the wd mass , for each value of @xmath35 ( ranging between 7.5 and 9.0 ) we vary the mass accretion rate between @xmath50yr@xmath19 and @xmath51yr@xmath19 to find the best - fit models .",
    "again we find that the best - fit models are around @xmath52 , but the difference between the @xmath47 values is not significant , and the improvement over the single wd models is also only marginal ( of the order of @xmath31% in the @xmath47 value ) .",
    "all these models are presented in table 2 .",
    "next , we decide to improve the disk model by varying the abundances , though we do not expect the fit to improve much because of the keplerian velocity broadening of the disk . however , we find that setting the silicon and sulfur to 3 and 20 times solar , resp .",
    ", actually reduced the @xmath47 value by 10% , more than for the single wd model .",
    "this is because the the siv ( 1006  & 1100 ) lines have better fits ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this best - fit single disk model has @xmath53 , @xmath54yr@xmath19 , a distance of 665 pc and @xmath55 .",
    "last , we fit composite wd+disk models . since the number of models increases exponentially when we change @xmath35 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 , we restrict our search using our best fit for @xmath35 , namely 8.3 .",
    "we also set the sulfur to 20 times solar and silicon 3 times solar .",

    ", one would not expect the wd to dominate the flux , but rather the wd would be almost completely masked by the swollen disk ; actually the system would likely be observed to undergo eclipses  but none have been observed . also , since bb dor can vary as much 0.4 mag in one hr , this means that the light can not be dominated by the wd , and the disk must be contributing at least 40% of the light . in other words , while the least @xmath37 indicates that the best fit is a wd with a rather flat disk component , there are other indications that this can not be correct .",
    "actually , the wd+disk high inclination model strikingly resembles the second component observed in the _ fuse _ spectra of some dwarf novae during quiescence ( e.g. vw hyi , @xcite ) .",
    "this is likely a caveat in the _ state - of - the - art _ spectral modeling , rather than an indication of a physical link between the the spectrum of bb dor and that of a dn in quiescence .",

    "these distances are typically underestimated by factors of 2.05 , 1.86 and 1.75 for the j , h and & k bands giving distances of 482 , 510 , and 534 pc , respectively , assuming the donor star contributes only @xmath79 of the total ir flux @xcite .",
    "the distance to bb dor is therefore certainly larger than 300 pc , and most likely in the range of @xmath80 pc .",
    "since bb dor was observed in a high state ( with 2mass ) , it is likely that the infrared flux of the donor star is on the lower side , namely even less than 1/4 , in which case the 500 pc itself is only a lower limit . using this restriction on the distance",
    ", we see that we can safely reject the single wd models ( with @xmath81pc ) , the high inclination models ( with @xmath82pc ) , and the large mass @xmath46 models ( with @xmath83pc and less ) .    on the basis of the distance alone ,",
    "the low inclination disk and wd+disk models are the best fits .",
    "these are also the best fit on the basis of the optical spectrum ( low inclination ) and visual magnitude ( high state / disk ) .",
    "we are now able to summarize the basic characteristics of the system and its wd .",
    "we are confident in the fact that the system must have a wd with @xmath84 , @xmath85k _ or lower _",
    "( disk+wd composite models ) , a mass accretion rate of the order of @xmath59yr@xmath19 ( disk and disk+wd models ) and a distance somewhere between 500 and 700 pc ( choosing the least @xmath37 models agreeing with the distance ) . from the best - fit single disk models",
    "alone we find that the inclination angle must be very small ( @xmath86 ) to fit the absorption lines .",
    "there is an indication that the sulfur and silicon are over abundant and it is also possible that some of the high - order ionization lines form in a layer in front of the disk and the wd .",
    "although the _ fuse _ spectrum of bb dor is rather poor and multiwavelength data are limited , we have narrowed down the region in the parameter space ( @xmath7 , @xmath87 , @xmath9 ) for this system .",
    "bb dor is now the sixth vy scl nl variable with a temperature estimate for its wd .",
    "with a temperature of @xmath62 k , the wd of bb dor marks the lower end of the temperature distribution for wds of vy scl nl variables , which , so far , for the 5 other systems , ranged between 40,000k and 47,000k @xcite .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of bb dor clearly shows the drop in flux in the shorter wavelengths , the signature of a moderate temperature when compared to the _ fuse _ spectra of these other vy scl systems ( see e.g. v794 aql , @xcite ) . even if we consider the single wd best - fit model , the wd temperature of bb dor only reaches 37,000k ( and the 40,000k @xmath46 model gives an unrealistic close distance of 135pc in disagreement with the expected ir emission from the secondary ) . in that respect , the data point in the ( @xmath88 ) plane for bb dor falls _ under _ the region of the vy scl nl variables , seemingly _ into _ the region of the parameter space populated with dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in figure 6 , the data point for bb dor does not seem to stand apart , and the separation between vy scl systems and dn can be made easily by drawing a diagonal line . in that respect , it is actually v794 aql that divides the two regions of the graph as indicated by the slanted line .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a prompt , concise and pertinent report which helped improve the analysis of the lines .",
    "special thanks to the austral variable star observer network ( avson ) , and in particular to berto monard for providing us with the visual magnitude of bb dor between 02 sep . , 2005 and 30 dec . , 2007 , and to peter nelson for a quick look v band photometry at bb dor on 28 jan . , 2008",
