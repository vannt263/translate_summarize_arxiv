    "during the last few years there has been a remarkable interest in the search for quasiparticle excitations which mimic the properties of majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "majorana - like quasiparticles were first predicted to occur in the @xmath0 fractional quantum hall state  @xcite , but it was more recently realized that they could be engineered by proximity - inducing superconductivity in materials with strong spin - orbit coupling , such as the surface states ( or edge states ) of a topological insulator  @xcite , or a two - dimensional semiconductor quantum well  @xcite .",
    "currently , much experimental interest is devoted to one - dimensional semiconductor nanowires  @xcite with strong spin - orbit coupling , such as insb or inas . when brought into proximity with a superconductor ( sc ) and exposed to a magnetic field",
    ", such wires can become effectively spinless @xmath1-wave scs , shown by kitaev  @xcite to host majorana bound states ( mbs ) at the end points .",
    "tunnel spectroscopy can be used to verify the existence of a mbs , for example at the end of a nanowire , since it gives rise to a characteristic conductance peak at zero bias voltage  @xcite .",
    "several recent experiments  @xcite have indeed observed such a peak in the expected parameter regimes , indicating the existence of mbs .",
    "however , other studies have shown that similar conductance peaks may arise also from e.g. , kondo physics  @xcite , weak anti - localization  @xcite , and subgap states  @xcite , making mbs identification only through tunnel spectroscopy somewhat problematic .",
    "alternatively , signatures of mbs could be found e.g. , in the quantized conductance steps in a more transparent junction ( quantum point contact )  @xcite , or in josephson junctions  @xcite , but all these experiments are associated with significant difficulties and it is not clear whether they can provide a true unique fingerprint of mbs .",
    "thermoelectric measurements can provide more information about a systems electronic properties than can be inferred from the conductance . here , the central quantity is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath2 , defined by the relation between an applied temperature difference @xmath3 and the resulting open - circuit voltage @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is related to the energy - derivative of the conductance and can therefore be used to distinguish between electron dominated ( @xmath6 ) and hole - dominated ( @xmath7 ) electric transport .",
    "a mbs has perfect electron - hole symmetry and should therefore not contribute to a non - zero @xmath5 ( even when coupling between mbs give rise to a finite - energy state ) .",
    "this is in contrast to sharp conductance resonances arising from , e.g , a highly peaked density of states ( dos )  @xcite , resonant levels  @xcite ( which give @xmath8 only when perfectly aligned with the fermi level ) , or the kondo effect  @xcite .",
    "combined measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath5 could therefore provide further evidence of mbs .",
    "however , also normal andreev bound states could give zero contribution to @xmath5 and , conversely , a majorana junction could have a non - zero @xmath5 if particle - hole symmetry is broken by some other mechanism , such as potential barriers or accidentally formed quantum dots ( qds ) close to the tunnel probe .",
    "a non - zero @xmath5 was indeed predicted in ref .",

    "the sc is grounded and kept at the ambient temperature . when measuring the conductance @xmath9 ( thermoconductance @xmath10 ) , n is electrically ( thermally ) biased . when measuring @xmath5 , n is thermally biased and the open - circuit ( thermal ) voltage @xmath4 is measured .",

    "we focus on a system where a qd is intentionally formed between the normal metal tunnel probe ( n ) and the mbs ( n - qd - mbs junction ) , see sketch in figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "this setup allows for a controlled breaking of particle - hole symmetry by shifting the qd energy level with a gate voltage @xmath15 .",
    "previous studies  @xcite have shown that the conductance of similar systems can reveal the existence of mbs .",
    "we show that @xmath16 , which can be measured in the same setup as the conductance , can provide complementary evidence of mbs .",
    "the n - qd - mbs system does , however , not guarantee a non - zero @xmath5 , which also requires the combined qd - mbs system to acquire a different temperature than that which is provided by the fermi sea in n. @xmath5 therefore depends on the coupling between the combined qd - mbs system and the dissipative environment provided by the bulk sc , the temperature of which differs by @xmath3 from that of n. we discuss how this allows thermoelectric measurements to provide information about the nature of the dissipative coupling and reveal , for example , relaxation of the fermion parity quantum number , even without coupling between different mbs .",
    "such information is crucial for the use of mbs in topological quantum computation schemes  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the minimal n - qd - mbs model used in the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : seebeck ] introduces a simple theory ( and analytic results ) for the thermoelectric properties , assuming that the qd - mbs system acquires the same temperature as the bulk superconductor . in section  [ sec : env ] we relax the condition of a perfectly thermalized qd - mbs system and instead consider two different models for the interactions with the dissipative environment formed by the bulk superconductor , which give rise to different thermoelectric responses .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes and concludes .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows a sketch of the n - qd - mbs junction .",
    "a normal metallic electrode is tunnel coupled to a quantum dot , which in turn is tunnel coupled to the edge of a sc ( figure  [ fig : setup ] shows an example setup with a semiconducting nanowire , but the discussion is not limited to this specific geometry ) .",
    "we consider the simplest possible model representing this setup , described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 , where @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the number operator for non - interacting electrons in state @xmath20 in n. n is biased with chemical potential @xmath21 ( we use units where @xmath22 ) and kept at temperature @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 describes the quantum dot with a single level controlled by a gate voltage , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the gate coupling .",
    "we consider the case where a large magnetic field has been applied to induce a topological superconducting phase , thereby also introducing a large zeemann splitting on the dot .",
    "we therefore only consider one spin species of dot electrons and can then neglect also the opposite spin in n ( the transport effects of spin and coulomb blockade was investigated in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h_m ] ) is a low - energy description of the edge of the sc in the topological regime  @xcite , which includes only the two mbs ( localized on opposite ends of the wire ) and therefore is valid for energies well within the superconducting gap .",

    "@xmath30 is the coupling between the two mbs , which vanishes exponentially with their separation .",
    "the second form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_m ] ) is written instead in terms of the operator @xmath31 , which describes a standard ( but nonlocal ) fermionic state with occupation @xmath32 .",
    "we assume the sc to be grounded with chemical potential @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , the bulk sc is kept at a fixed temperature @xmath34 , but we defer the discussion on how this temperature affects the low - energy mbs to section  [ sec : env ] .",
    "@xmath35 describes the coupling between n and the qd with amplitude @xmath36 .",
    "we neglect the @xmath20-dependence of both @xmath36 and the normal electrode dos @xmath37 , which leads to an energy - independent tunnel coupling @xmath38 , setting the inverse time scale for single - electron tunneling between n and the qd .",
    "tunneling between the qd and the sc is described by @xmath39 , where we have again projected the sc hamiltonian close to midgap onto the mbs represented by @xmath40 ( we assume negligible coupling between the qd and @xmath41 ) . written in terms of the fermion operator @xmath42 , the tunneling is seen to contain anomalous terms ( @xmath43 ) which do not conserve particle number .",
    "this reflects the fact that the @xmath44 state is an equal superposition of an electron and a hole , and can be filled ( @xmath45 ) either by adding an electron ( @xmath46 ) or a hole ( @xmath47 ) to the sc from the qd .",

    "the linear regime is , however , limited also in a qd coupled to two normal electrodes when taking cotunneling or broadening of the qd level into account  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in figure  [ fig : simpleresults](b ) we compare our result from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssimple ] ) with @xmath121 of a qd coupled to two normal electrodes ( l and r ) , i.e. , a n - qd - n junction , calculated within a scattering formalism  @xcite .",

    "@xmath5 is then independent of @xmath123 and we adjust @xmath106 to obtain approximately the same peak values of @xmath5 as for the case with a mbs .",

    "the difference is clearer when plotting the result on a logarithmic scale , see inset in figure  [ fig : simpleresults](b ) . from a measurement of @xmath121",

    "in section  [ sec : seebeck ] we assumed the qd - mbs system to be in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath125 which differs from that in n , but we did not specify how thermal equilibrium is reached . in general , within our perturbative approach we should instead find the occupation probabilities @xmath75 of the eigenstates of @xmath53 from rate equations @xmath126 equation  ( [ eq : me ] ) expresses that the change in occupation of @xmath79 , which is zero in the steady state , is given by the sum of all ingoing processes , minus the sum of all outgoing processes , each weighted by the occupation of the corresponding initial state .",

    "if we find the rate matrix @xmath127 from lowest order perturbation theory in @xmath35 , it is the same as @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wi ] ) , except that the second term comes with a plus sign . to find @xmath10 we solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) and  ( [ eq : pnorm ] ) with @xmath91 .",
    "this gives @xmath129 , i.e. , boltzmann distributed according to the temperature of n , as imposed by the fermi distribution of the tunneling electrons .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the lack of dissipation in the sc within the low - energy hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h_m ] ) : the mbs can carry a current due to the lack of charge conservation , but has zero width and does not allow energy to be dissipated and can therefore not act as a thermal bath . inserting this distribution of @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gtsimple ] ) ( or the corresponding expression with @xmath130 ) , we find @xmath109 and therefore also @xmath131 , as expected since no real temperature difference exists .    to have a finite thermoelectric effect and motivate the results found in section  [ sec : seebeck ] we need to couple @xmath53 to an additional dissipative environment , held at the temperature of the sc .",
    "one such source of dissipation is a finite continuous dos inside the superconducting gap  @xcite , often observed in experiments where superconductivity is proximity - induced in e.g. , a nanowire  @xcite , see inset of figure  [ fig : relax](a ) .",
    "we model the continuum of subgap states as an additional normal electrode with a hamiltonian analogous to @xmath132 and a coupling to the qd analogous to @xmath35 . assuming the subgap dos to be constant within the relevant energy window of width @xmath133 , this gives rise to equivalent contributions to @xmath127 as the coupling to n , but proportional to a different tunnel coupling @xmath68 and with the fermi functions evaluated at @xmath34 , @xmath33 .",

    "the results are identical to what was found in section  [ sec : seebeck ] .",
    "when @xmath142 , heating n also heats the qd - mbs system to a temperature @xmath143 and @xmath10 is reduced since the effective temperature difference becomes smaller .",
    "the width of the peak in @xmath138 is @xmath144 for @xmath145 , but @xmath146 for @xmath141 when tunneling from the qd to the subgap states in the sc gives a substantial contribution ( the peak height is independent of @xmath68 since @xmath147 guarantees that tunneling into the mbs dominates at @xmath137 ) .",

    "in addition to the above considered relaxation due to tunneling into subgap states , which changes the qd occupation @xmath52 , we also investigate relaxation due to quasiparticles tunneling into one of the edge mbs , thereby changing the occupation number @xmath44 . such quasiparticle poisoning is a known problem in superconducting charge qubits  @xcite and has been considered also for topological sc with mbs  @xcite .",
    "we do not specify the source of the quasiparticles or a microscopic model , but employ a simple phenomenological description with thermally distributed quasiparticles ( at temperature @xmath34 ) with constant density of states . the relaxation rates which should be added to @xmath127 are then @xmath150 @xmath121 for different coupling strengths @xmath71 are shown in figure  [ fig : relax](c ) .",
    "for very large @xmath71 , the results are similar to figures  [ fig : simpleresults](b ) and  [ fig : relax](b ) , but for smaller @xmath71 , @xmath5 becomes significantly suppressed and the lineshape is much more narrow .",
    "the reason for the difference in relaxation due to @xmath68 and due to @xmath71 lies in the eigenstates which are coupled by the corresponding processes , see sketch in figure  [ fig : eigen ] .",
    "@xmath68 , like @xmath13 , changes @xmath52 and therefore mainly couples @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which always have different energies .",
    "@xmath71 instead changes @xmath44 and thus primarily couples @xmath69 and @xmath72 , which for @xmath92 have exactly the same energy .",
    "two uncoupled mbs form a zero - energy fermionic state , the occupation of which is always @xmath151 in thermal equilibrium , regardless of the temperature .",
    "a dissipative coupling of @xmath69 and @xmath72 can therefore not impose a temperature on the qd - mbs system at @xmath92 , which adopts the temperature of n leading to @xmath109 and @xmath8 .",
    "the finite @xmath10 results from the eigenstates being superpositions of different number states , which gives a small coupling @xmath152 also of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the effective temperature of the qd - mbs system is then given by @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath10 , and therefore @xmath5 , vanish when this effective temperature approaches @xmath23 , i.e. , when @xmath154 .",
    "the narrow lineshape of @xmath121 results from @xmath155 when @xmath156 .",
    "however , also @xmath9 is affected by the quasiparticle poisoning and the precise form of @xmath121 is nontrivial .",
    "nonetheless , if the subgap states can be suppressed such that @xmath157 , a measurement of @xmath121 allows for an estimate of @xmath71 , either an order - of - magnitude estimate based on the decrease and changed lineshape of @xmath121 for @xmath158 , or a more accurate estimate based on comparison with numerical results .",
    "note that @xmath13 can be found from a conductance measurement and can be controlled with gates in a setup as in figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the above discussion suggests that when @xmath71 dominates relaxation , @xmath5 should be very sensitive to a coupling between the two mbs at the opposite ends of the wire , resulting in a finite energy @xmath30 associated with occupation of the fermionic @xmath44 state .",
    "this is indeed seen in figure  [ fig : relax](d ) , where both the magnitude and lineshape of @xmath121 is drastically affected by an increasing @xmath30 . for comparison ,",
    "the result is shown for the largest value of @xmath30 also for @xmath68-dominated relaxation .",
    "in general , whenever there is significant relaxation due to subgap states like in figure  [ fig : relax](b ) , or when thermal equilibrium is assumed like in figure  [ fig : simpleresults](b ) , the peak value of @xmath5 increases with increasing @xmath30 . however , the effect is qualitatively different and much smaller than for @xmath71-dominated relaxation : there is no effect unless @xmath159 and the slope remains the same in the range of @xmath11 where @xmath121 grows linearly , but this linear range is increased ( both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , however , individually suppressed by @xmath130 ) .",
    "in this work , we have theoretically investigated the thermoelectric properties of a n - qd - mbs junction . the qd level breaks particle - hole symmetry , which is otherwise perfect for a mbs , and leads to a finite seebeck effect .",
    "the seebeck coefficient is calculated as a function of the qd level position and is shown to be different for the qd - mbs system than for other origins of sharp conductance resonances .",
    "thermoelectric measurements can therefore provide evidence of mbs complementary to standard conductance measurements , where both experiments can be done in the same setup .",
    "a further advantage of thermoelectric measurements is that , unlike the conductance , the seebeck coefficient remains large even for very weak tunnel coupling to the mbs .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the seebeck coefficient is sensitive to the nature and strength of the coupling of the qd - mbs system to its dissipative environment .",
    "for example , the result is markedly different when dissipation is dominated by subgap states in the sc compared to when it is dominated by quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "if quasiparticle poisoning dominates dissipation , the associated rate could be estimated from the shape and amplitude of @xmath121 , even without coupling between the two end mbs .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the possibility to use thermolectric measurements to detect majorana bound states and to investigate their coupling to a dissipative environment . </S>",
    "<S> the particle - hole symmetry of majorana states would normally lead to a vanishing seebeck coefficient , i.e. , a vanishing open - circuit voltage resulting from a temperature gradient . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how coupling to a quantum dot with a gate - controlled energy level breaks particle - hole symmetry in a tunable manner . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting gate - dependent seebeck coefficient provides a new way to evidence the existence of majorana states , which can be combined with conventional tunnel spectroscopy in the same setup . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the thermoelectric properties rely on the ability of the quantum dot - majorana system to sense the temperature of the bulk superconductor and can be used to extract information about the dissipative decay of majorana states , which is crucial for quantum information applications . </S>"
