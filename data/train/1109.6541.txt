    "interference alignment ( ia ) has been touted as a key technology for handling interference in future wireless communications @xcite .",
    "contrary to the conventional schemes which orthogonalize interference signals , @xcite showed that ia can achieve a total of @xmath0 degrees of freedom ( dof ) in an @xmath1-transmitter single - input single - output ( siso ) interference channel ( ic ) .",
    "the achievable dof for @xmath1-transmitter mimo has been found in @xcite . despite the promising aspects of ia , its implementation has many challenges .",
    "ia generally requires the perfect global channel knowledge of desired and interfering channels at the transmitter which involves excessive signal overheads although blind ia schemes @xcite without requiring channel knowledge have recently been proposed for some specific environments .",
    "imperfect channel state information significantly degrades the gain of ia @xcite .",
    "the large computation complexity necessitated is also regarded as a big challenge for practical implementation .",
    "the sub - optimality of ia in the practical operating snr region is another problem @xcite .",
    "recently , ia techniques to ameliorate these problems have been investigated .",
    "iterative ia algorithms were proposed to optimize precoding matrix and to reduce the global channel knowledge burden based on channel reciprocity @xcite . to reduce computational complexity ,",
    "suh and tse @xcite proposed a subspace interference alignment technique for an uplink cellular network system . in @xcite ,",
    "ia was opportunistically performed in mimo cognitive radio networks , where secondary transmitters transmit their signals on only spatial dimensions not used by primary transmitters .",
    "ia with imperfect channel state information ( csi ) was shown to achieve the same dof as ia with perfect csi if the feedback size per user is properly scaled @xcite .",
    "also , ia with imperfect csi in correlated channel was studied in @xcite .",
    "although there have been significant efforts to overcome the practical challenges , the inherent shortcomings of ia highly motivate the development of more practical techniques .",
    "it is desirable to attain the promised gain of ia with limited feedback and reduced computational complexity . in this context",
    ", interference management by user selection attracts attentions .",
    "the key idea behind this opportunistic interference management is to select and serve the user with the best channel or interference condition .",
    "the selection criteria include maximum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , minimum interference - to - noise ratio ( inr ) , maximum signal - to - interference - pulse - noise ratio ( sinr ) , and so on @xcite .      in this paper , we propose opportunistic interference alignment ( oia ) schemes by interpreting the opportunistic interference management from a perspective of ia . in our proposed oia ,",
    "the user dimensions provided by multiple users is exploited to align interfering signals .",
    "different forms of oia have been proposed in @xmath2-user siso ic using the random phase offset @xcite and in a cognitive radio network @xcite .",
    "there are three transmitters and three user groups associated with the transmitters .",
    "each user feeds one scalar value of an _ interference alignment measure _ back to the own transmitter , which indicates how well the interfering channels are well aligned .",
    "based on the feedback information , each transmitter selects and serves only a single user whose interfering channels are most aligned so that a three - transmitter mimo ic is opportunistically constructed .",
    "thus , interference alignment is achieved by user selection rather than transmit beamforming .",
    "collaboration and information sharing among transmitters are not required .",
    "the proposed oia combines the concepts of opportunistic beamforming and ia .",
    "contrary to opportunistic beamforming in a mimo broadcast channel @xcite , each user only considers the interfering channels rather than the desired channel ; the interference from one transmitter helps the other transmitter s user selection .",
    "the basic concept of oia was roughly introduced in 3-transmitter @xmath3 mimo ic @xcite and @xmath4 mimo ic @xcite .",
    "however , the maximum achievable dof by the oia and the relationship between the achievable dof and the required user scaling were not found . in this paper",
    ", we generalize our preliminary studies on oia @xcite .",
    "we consider the three - transmitter @xmath5 mimo ic where @xmath6 and show that each transmitter can obtain dof up to @xmath7 via the proposed user selection .",
    "we also derive the required user scaling to obtain given dof .    for implementation ,",
    "we propose two oia schemes . in the first oia scheme ( oia1 ) , each user directly minimizes the rate loss induced by the interfering channels .",
    "thus , each transmitter selects a user with the minimum rate loss . in the second oia scheme ( oia2 ) , aligned level of interfering channels is geometrically interpreted ; the transmitter selects a user whose interfering channels span the closest subspaces .",
    "the complexity of oia2 can be reduced compared to oia1 through a geometric interpretation .",
    "we investigate the achievable dof and user scaling law of the oia scheme in a three - transmitter mimo ic where @xmath2 users are associated with each transmitter , and the selected users together with their transmitters construct a three - transmitter mimo ic . in our system model , each transmitter sends @xmath7 streams with @xmath8 antennas , and each receiver has @xmath9 antennas .    * we prove that each transmitter can achieve dof @xmath7 by the oia schemes without symbol extension and no cooperation . in this case , we show that the transmitter and the selected user act like interference - free @xmath10 point - to - point mimo system . for @xmath11 mimo ic composed of three transmitters and three users , @xmath12 dof per user",
    "is known to be achievable ( with perfect csit and symbol extension ) @xcite .",
    "our result seems to be contradictory at first glance , but the required spatial dimensions for @xmath7 data streams are secured through the user dimensions provided by the @xmath2 users .",
    "this means that multiuser dof are translated into ia spatial dimensions .",
    "* we show that the number of users associated with each transmitter , @xmath2 , is enough to be scaled as @xmath13 to achieve @xmath14 $ ] dof per transmitter . when @xmath2 is fixed , the achievable dof by the oia schemes is proved to be zero .",
    "* finally , we look into the practical advantages of the proposed oia schemes ; we show that the oia scheme based on geometric concept significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving a notable rate improvement compared to conventional opportunistic user selection schemes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our system model is described in section ii .",
    "preliminaries about the angles between two subspaces are provided in section iii .",
    "the proposed oia schemes are described in section iv , and the achievable rate and dof are analyzed in section v. several conventional opportunistic user selection schemes are summarized and compared with oia schemes in section vi .",
    "the conclusions and comments on areas of future interest are given in section vii .      throughout the paper ,",

    "there are three transmitters having @xmath29 antennas , and each transmitter has its own user group consisting of @xmath2 users with @xmath30 antennas each .",
    "each transmitter selects a single user in its own user group and sends @xmath7 data streams to the selected user .",
    "consequently , the transmitters and their selected users construct a three - transmitter mimo ic . for user selection ,",
    "each transmitter uses only partial information fed back from each user , which is a single scalar value .",
    "no collaborations and no information sharing are allowed among the transmitters .",
    "our system operates with following four steps :    * step 1 : each transmitter broadcasts a reference signal . *",
    "step 2 : each user feeds one analog value back to the own transmitter . * step 3 : each transmitter selects one user in its user group .",
    "* step 4 : each transmitter serves the selected user with the random beams .    in step 1 , each transmitter broadcasts a reference signal .",
    "thus , each user obtains the information of the desired channel and two interfering channels . in step 2",
    ", each user generates the feedback information from the channel information , which is one scalar value .",
    "various feedback information can be constructed according to the postprocessing and the user selection schemes . in step 3",
    ", each transmitter selects a single user in its user group .",
    "note that the user selection at each transmitter is independent of one another because there are no information sharing and collaboration among the transmitters . in step 4 ,",
    "the transmitters serve the selected users with the random beams .",
    "thus , the three - transmitter mimo ic is opportunistically constructed .    since a user selection at each transmitter",
    "does not affect the performances of the other transmitters , without loss of generality , we only consider the user selection at the first transmitter .",
    "other transmitters can achieve the same average achievable rate with the identical setting .    at the @xmath31th user in the first user group ,",
    "the received signal denoted by @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the channel matrix from transmitter @xmath35 to user @xmath31 in the first user group .",
    "the term @xmath36 is the transmit signal of the @xmath35th transmitter .",
    "since each transmitter does not have channel state information , we assume equal power allocation among @xmath7 data streams , i.e. , @xmath37 . the random vector @xmath38 is gaussian noise with zero mean and an identity covariance matrix , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath40 , the system model becomes statistically identical with @xmath4 mimo ic if each transmitter uses an arbitrary precoding matrix @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .    from",
