    "since the observation of low - lying k@xmath16=0@xmath10 bands in doubly even radium nuclei  @xcite the possibility that some nuclei can be described by a mean field approach with broken reflection symmetry has been considered  @xcite .",
    "numerous experimental and theoretical discoveries were done in the 80 s providing extra evidence of reflection asymmetric octupole deformation around a=225  @xcite .",
    "many of these nuclei have been studied at isolde in beta decay experiments  @xcite . in odd",
    "- a nuclei an important feature of static octupole deformation is the observation of parity doublets , i.e. rotational bands lying close in excitation energy with the same intrinsic parameters and spins , but opposite parity .",
    "a survey of the available data for odd - a nuclei reveals that the largest amount of octupole correlations is present in the ac and pa nuclei .",
    "in particular for the odd actinium isotopes near a = 225 spectroscopy studies have been done in @xmath17 decay ( @xmath18ac ) , @xmath19 decay ( @xmath20ac ) and reactions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . the high spin states of @xmath21ac observed in heavy - ion fusion reactions  @xcite have been described using small quadrupole and octupole deformation components @xmath22 = @xmath23 = 0.05 .",
    "the nucleus @xmath24ac was predicted as a good example of octupole instability with the k = 5/2 and k= 3/2 band heads calculated to be very close in energy .",
    "experimentally two bands were found  @xcite with the same angular momentum , opposite parity and an average difference of 44 kev between equivalent members of the doublets .",
    "this fact suggested parity doublets but the differences in intrinsic dipole moment ( d@xmath25 ) values indicated that the two bands originate from different orbitals .",
    "the low - energy spectra of @xmath26ac display the k=3/2 and k=5/2 parity doublets  @xcite .",
    "in @xmath27ac only the k=5/2 parity doublet band , observed at 300 kev excitation energy , can be described in terms of static octupole deformation . in the case of @xmath28ac the four k=1/2@xmath29 and k=3/2@xmath29 bands observed in ( t,@xmath17 ) reactions  @xcite",
    "are interpreted either as normal nilsson levels or by assuming a weak octupole coupling , @xmath23 = 0.07  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the low energy properties of the @xmath30ac isotopes have been accounted for using the reflection asymmetric rotor - plus - quasiparticle model  @xcite and , in this context , the @xmath31ac isotopes have been described as shape transitional nuclei .",
    "the study of transitional nuclei in the upper border of this octupole deformed region is of relevance to understand the interplay of octupole and quadrupole collectivities . in transitional nuclei",
    "the mechanism of grouping rotational bands differs from that of parity - doublets in nuclei with stable octupole deformation .",
    "two intrinsic states ( or rotational bands ) with a given k and opposite parity have strong octupole correlations , if the dominant one - quasiparticle component of the first partner coupled to the octupole phonon of the core forms the largest collective component in the structure of the second partner and vice versa .",
    "experimentally one observes an enhancement of the e1 strength for the parity pair partner bands .    with this aim",
    "the is322 collaboration at isolde - cern has carried out a systematic investigation of the heavy transitional fr  th nuclei , for which scarce spectroscopic information was available .",
    "these experiments have provided the first information on the absolute values of b(e1 ) in this octupole transitional region .",
    "relatively large b(e1 ) rates have been measured indicating the presence of octupole correlations in @xmath27fr  @xcite , @xmath28ra  @xcite and @xmath28th  @xcite .",
    "much weaker but still noticeable are the correlations in the heavier @xmath0ra  @xcite and @xmath0th  @xcite isotopes .",
    "we report here on the structure of their isobar , @xmath0ac .",
    "actinium-231 was first produced by bombarding @xmath32th with 14-mev neutrons  @xcite .",
    "its half - life was then measured to be 7.5 @xmath33 0.1 min and the strongest @xmath1 rays into @xmath0th were identified .",
    "the proton pickup ( t,@xmath17 ) reaction was used to investigate the structure of @xmath34pa and its isotone @xmath0ac  @xcite . in the case of @xmath0ac",
    "the lack of information from beta decay caused that the band assignments from the experimental cross sections were only based on a comparison to those assigned to the isotone @xmath34pa .",
    "a later study , and the only previous investigation where the @xmath2 decay of ra has been reported  @xcite , assigned six gamma lines to @xmath0ac . from their time behaviour a half - life of 103(3 ) s was obtained for ra , but no attempt to build a level scheme was made .    in this paper",
    "the low - energy structure of @xmath0ac fed in the @xmath2 decay of @xmath0ra has been investigated by @xmath1-@xmath1 and @xmath1-e@xmath10 spectroscopy .",
    "multipolarities of 28 transitions have been established by measuring conversion electrons with a mini - orange electron spectrometer .",

    "the deduced b(e1 ) rates are used to infer the possible presence of octupole correlations in the @xmath0ac nucleus .",
    "the study on the ac structure is based on two sets of measurements performed at the psb - isolde on - line mass separator @xcite . in both experiments ,",
    "a 1 gev proton beam from the cern ps - booster bombarded a uc@xmath15-c target , producing via spallation reactions the a=231 isobars . in the first experiment",
    "the excited structure of ac was populated directly from the @xmath19 decay of ra with an estimated production of 4@xmath3510@xmath36 atoms per @xmath37c . in the second experiment a ta(re ) surface ionizer",
    "was employed , favouring the ionization of fr , and ac was populated through the decay chain of fr @xmath3 ra @xmath3 ac @xcite , with an estimated yield of 7@xmath3510@xmath38 fr ions per @xmath37c .",
    "the produced ions were accelerated to 60 kv and mass - separated before being collected onto a magnetic tape transport system which connected two independent but simultaneously operated measurement stations .",
    "the radioactive beam was deposited in the centre of the _ fast timing station _ specially designed to measure the half - life of excited states in the nano- and pico - second range by the advanced time delayed ( atd ) @xmath14(t ) method @xcite .",
    "the setup of this station consisted of a 3 mm thick ne111a plastic scintillator positioned behind the tape at the collection point and used as fast - timing @xmath19-detector .",
    "the thickness was chosen to have an almost uniform response to the different @xmath19 energies .",
    "a 2.5 cm thick baf@xmath15 scintillator was used as fast - timing gamma detector .",
    "in addition , there were two hpge detectors with relative efficiencies of 70 % and 40 % , respectively , and energy ranges from 30 to 1500 kev .",
    "they were used to provide a unique selection of the @xmath1 decay branch in the @xmath14(t ) method and to study @xmath39 coincidences in order to determine the level scheme .",
    "a detailed description of the setup is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "up to seven parameters were recorded simultaneously for each event , namely the @xmath19 energy and up to three @xmath1 energies plus the time differences between the @xmath19 signal and a given coincident @xmath1 event .",
    "the energy and efficiency calibrations of the gamma detectors were determined using a ba source and an absolutely calibrated mixed source of co , y , cd , ce , sn , cs and am .",
    "the a = 231 sample was transported one meter away by the tape to the _ conversion electron station _ specially designed for gamma identification and electron conversion measurements .",
    "it consisted of an electron spectrometer , a gamma telescope and a @xmath19 detector .",
    "the electron spectrometer incorporated a mini - orange filter @xcite and a 2 mm thick si(li ) detector with an active area of 300 mm@xmath40 and 1.9 kev energy resolution at @xmath41100 kev .",
    "the detector was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature by means of a copper cold finger . for the mini - orange filter a first set of permanent magnets",
    "was carefully shaped according to the design of van klinken and wisshak .",
    "a relatively high transmission of 1.8 % of 4@xmath42 was achieved , but over a small energy range .",
    "thus the set of magnets finally chosen had a lower ( @xmath430.5% ) but more uniform transmission over a broad range of energies ( @xmath4125 @xmath44 800 kev ) .",
    "this set consisted of three equally spaced rectangular magnetic plates of 50 x 20 x 5 mm@xmath36 , with the largest dimension oriented radially .",
    "measurements with different mini - orange and detector positions showed that the transmission maximum was achieved with de si(li ) detector at 150 mm from the source and the mini - orange approximately midway between the source and the detector .",
    "a central lead absorber was used to shield the detector from direct x - rays and @xmath1 rays .    the gamma telescope consisted of a 19.5 cm@xmath36 planar hpge followed by a 20 % coaxial hpge , both in a single cryostat behind a 300 @xmath37 m beryllium window .",
    "the fwhm energy resolution varied from 0.4 kev at very low energies up to 1.4 kev at e@xmath46=560 kev for the planar detector , and between 1.3 kev at e@xmath46=137 kev and 2.5 kev at e@xmath46=1836 kev for the coaxial detector .",
    "special care was given to detect low energy @xmath1 rays with the limit of sensitivity in the planar detector being 4 kev in single events and about 12 kev in coincidence events .",
    "the ge - escape peaks of the main l x - ray components of ra , ac and th from 4.9 to 6.7 kev are clearly identified .",
    "this blurs unfortunately the possible contribution of any low energy gamma lines .",
    "the l x - rays from am have allowed to extend the efficiency calibration down to 13.4 kev .",
    "moreover , @xmath19-gated @xmath1 ray singles spectra were also recorded with the coaxial ge detector . for beta - gating ,",
    "a ne102 plastic scintillator was placed outside the chamber in front of the gamma telescope . simultaneously to the gamma spectra , conversion electron singles spectra were measured with the electron spectrometer . by dividing the acquisition time into 8 consecutive subgroups , @xmath1 multispectra from the planar ge detector , the @xmath19-gated coaxial ge detector and the electron detectors were also recorded allowing time evolution studies .",
    "the e@xmath10 and @xmath1 signals were also recorded in list - mode allowing for an identification of @xmath1 lines in coincidences down to 12 kev .",
    "the energy and efficiency calibrations for these detectors were obtained using sources of ba and eu , and the practically summing - free mixed source previously described .",
    "singles spectra from the planar detector as well as electron and @xmath19-gated @xmath1 singles spectra for the coaxial hpge were collected in the _ conversion electron station_.    data were collected in three different modes of operation . in the first two ,",
    "measurements were conducted simultaneously at the two stations , i.e. while a sample was measured in the _ conversion electron station _ a new one was collected at the _ fast timing _ one .",
    "the time cycle was chosen to enhance the nucleus activity of interest in the isobaric chain .",
    "the time interval had to be slightly shorter than a multiple of the proton supercycle from the cern ps - booster .",
    "in the first experiment the cycles were chosen as 17 s and 190 s , and in the second one as 26 s and 200 s , respectively , to enhance the decay of fr ( t@xmath11 = 17.5(8 ) s ) and ra ( t@xmath11 = 103(3 ) s ) . in the third mode of operation",
    "the tape was stopped , and the beam was continuously deposited at the collection point in order to enhance the decay of ac to th ( t@xmath11 = 450 s ) .",

    "the beam intensity was reduced to limit the count rate in the beta detector to 10000 counts / s . only data from the long cycle has been used for the present analysis , with 5 hours of data taking .",
    "the results on ra and th have been reported in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "in the present study , the results on the decay of ra to ac are based on the data collected with the long cycles .",
    "the intensity ratio of the gamma lines between the short and long cycles has helped to identify the low intensity gamma transitions .",
    "the most intense @xmath1 transitions have been assigned to the decay of ra by comparing their temporal behaviour to that of the ac x - rays .",
    "the fifteen most intense @xmath1 transitions have been used to deduce the half - life value .",

    "[ lowenergyplanar ] shows the low energy gamma spectrum recorded in the planar detector at the _ conversion electron station_. notice that the sensitivity of the detector reached below 5 kev of energy .",
    "the aim was to identify the expected low energy transitions as proposed to exist in the 2p-2n neighbour @xmath27fr  @xcite .",
    "the peaks observed between 4.8 and 6.4 kev have been identified as the k@xmath48 and k@xmath49 escape peaks in germanium of the most intense l x - ray components of ac and th .",
    "these low energy peaks are about 10 - 12 % of the l x - ray assuming that the relative variation of efficiency in this energy range is the same , and that the efficiencies at these very low energies followed the curves given in  @xcite .",
    "the lines marked with an asterisk belong to the decay chain of the a=231 molecule @xmath50raf observed mainly in the data of the second experiment .",
    "the gamma transitions belonging to the @xmath19 decay of ac are listed in table  [ gammastab ] , the energies of the @xmath1 transitions are the average of the values obtained in the two experiments .",
    "the uncertainties in the intensity values were calculated as a weighted mean of the statistical errors and the error in the efficiency curve .",
    "the latter one was estimated to be 10 % for the planar detector up to energies of 40 kev and 6 % for higher energies .",
    "the uncertainties of the efficiency curve of the coaxial detector are estimated to be 5 % up to 205 kev and 3 % for higher energies .",
    "profiting from the good resolution of the planar detector ( 0.4 kev at 6 kev and 0.5 kev at 54 kev ) some transitions could be only separated in this detector , in these cases the intensity was taken from the planar detector only .",
    "summing of the k x - rays with the most intense @xmath1 lines was observed in the planar detector .",
    "the summing contribution was estimated to be 1.2(2 )  % from the intensity of the peaks observed at 145.05(10 ) and 168.72(8 ) kev in comparison with the individual intensities of the k x - ray and the 54.29 and 77.97 kev @xmath1 rays .",
    "these low intensity peaks were not observed in the coaxial 20  % hpge detector placed behind the planar detector .",
    "therefore we consider the relative intensity given in table  [ gammastab ] for the 409.9 kev @xmath1 transition as the one obtained in the coaxial detector in order to avoid the possible contribution of summing of the 204.79(10 ) and 205.00(10 ) kev @xmath1 lines .",

    "the relative intensities of @xmath1 transitions are listed in table  [ gammastab ] .",
    "the 54.29 kev transition has been chosen for the normalization , since the most intense one at 205 kev is a doublet as clearly observed in the coincidence study .",

    "matrix a comparison of intensity of the 205.00 and the 198.18 kev @xmath1 lines both de - exciting the 266.76 kev state has given a relative intensity for this component of 60% of the total gamma intensity in good agreement with the value deduced from singles .",
