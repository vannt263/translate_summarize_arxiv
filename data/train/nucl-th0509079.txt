    "the question `` what is the shape '' of a nucleus is an old one , and probably dates back to the introduction of bohr s liquid drop model @xcite .",
    "modern nuclear physics has tried to find answers to this question in many areas of the table of isotopes .",
    "one area of extreme experimental interest is the @xmath3 region for intermediate mass , where all the simple models tell us nuclear dynamics rapidly changes with proton and neutron number .",
    "such proton - rich nuclei are also important in the rp - process of nucleo - synthesis , and are of interest since they are only accessible with modern experimental facilities .",
    "mean - field methods are one way to give microscopic meaning to the concept of nuclear shape .",
    "they have been used quite extensively in nuclear physics @xcite , since they give a good starting point for the description of many but the lightest of nuclei .",
    "there are a large number of improvements one can make , either at a single minimum in the mean - field energy ( random phase phase approximation , projection techniques , quasi - particle expansions ) , or in the case that a single minimum is insufficient ( time - dependent hartree - fock and related methods , hill - wheeler method , etc . ) .    in this work",
    "we shall apply the theory of large - amplitude collective motion @xcite , which is a method that tries to describe , in a self - consistent fashion , a few - dimensional surface in which most of the low - energy dynamics takes place .",
    "there are many related methods in use in many areas of physics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "our method is just one of a large set of techniques applied to this problem in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "even though it is derived in a very different way , it shows great similarity to the hill - wheeler method , which relies on the constrained hartree - fock bogoliubov ( chfb ) technique . here a set of slater determinants determined by a small set of judiciously chosen one - body constraints is used to map out what is presumably a dominant part of the space of all configurations .",
    "the analogy with the technique of generating states for specified angular momentum by imposing constraints ( cranking ) leads to the name `` generalised cranking '' .",
    "the one - body constraints usually consist of a few carefully chosen multipole , or particle - hole , operators , as well as a few generalised pairing , or particle - particle , ones . for large scale realistic problems such as the description of nuclear fission the number of generalised cranking operators needed in order to make",
    "a realistic calculation can become very large .",
    "there is also no reason to limit the constraints to the standard choices ; other degrees of freedom , especially those involving spin - orbit interactions might also be important .",
    "a more satisfactory method should allow the cranking operators to be determined by the nuclear collective dynamics itself .",
    "one such approach , followed in this paper and set out in detail in the review paper ref .",
    "@xcite as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( a similar approach , plus relevant references , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , leads to a very well - defined approach , which can in principle be solved knowing the hamiltonian and model space . to find the adiabatic collective path we use the local harmonic approximation ( lha ) .",
    "it consists of a constrained mean - field problem that needs to be solved together with a local random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which determines the constraining operator .",
    "this approach lacks practicality , since the size of the rpa problem is , for a system with pairing , proportional to the size of the single - particle space squared .",
    "even though enormous matrices can routinely be diagonalised on modern computer systems , the algorithm requires repeated diagonalisation of such a matrix , which makes an implementation in realistic calculations prohibitively time consuming .",
    "a practical solution to this problem was given in ref .",
    "it consist of solving the rpa in a limited basis of state dependent operators .",
    "this was shown to give excellent results for low lying rpa solutions in the minimum as well as along the collective path .",
    "our japanese colleagues have developed an interesting alternative based on the full rpa for separable forces , which can be solved by dispersion relations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we set out to study the the collective motion in rotating nuclei .",
    "the method is a generalised version of the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where we study collective path at a given angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "experimental results show a large variety of shape - coexistence phenomena at low angular momentum in the mass - region around @xmath4kr  @xcite .",
    "this is therefore a good testing ground for large amplitude collective motion calculations in rotating nuclei .",
    "details of the formalism can be found in our previous work , specifically refs .",
    "it is based on time - dependent mean field theory , and the fact that this is a form of classical hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the issue of selecting collective coordinates can then be separated in two steps , the determination of the hamiltonian governing the classical mechanics and the approximate decoupling of a few modes in classical mechanics . to facilitate the second task",
    ", we usually make the additional assumption of slow motion , called the adiabatic approximation . in that limit",
    ", it sufficed to expand the hamiltonian to second order in momenta , and we have a problem that can be solved in closed form .",
    "the solution , as succinctly summarised below , can be stated without any reference to the original nuclear many - body problem and the choice of the interaction .",
    "the alternative method set out in ref .",
    "@xcite looks rather different , and relies heavily on the use of slater determinants . as discussed in the appendix",
    ", it is very close to our work and only differs in small details .      by parameterising the expectation value of the quantum - hamiltonian with a set of classical coordinates , which corresponds to a classical boson mapping of the density matrix @xcite , we can parametrise the hamiltonian locally in terms of a set of coordinates and momenta .",
    "clearly , we could also work in the language of differential forms , and avoid specifying coordinates , and coordinate frames that are chosen differently at different points @xcite .",
    "such elegance would hide the technical aspects of obtaining a suitable algorithm .",
    "we assume a classical hamiltonian depending on a set of real canonical coordinates , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and conjugate momenta , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the potential @xmath9 and the mass matrix @xmath10 are given by an expansion of @xmath11 in powers of @xmath12 in zeroth and second order , respectively , @xmath13 terms of higher order ( such as @xmath14 ) are supposed to be negligible .",
    "the central part in our approach to large amplitude motion is a search for collective ( and non - collective ) coordinates @xmath15 which are obtained by an invertible point transformation of the original coordinates @xmath5 , preserving the quadratic truncation of the momentum dependence of the hamiltonian , by @xmath16 and the corresponding transformation relations for the momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 where we use a standard notation for the derivatives , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the adiabatic hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2 ] ) , is then transformed into @xmath22 in the new coordinates .",
    "the new coordinates @xmath15 are to be divided into three categories : the collective coordinate @xmath23 , the zero - mode coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which describe motions that do not change the energy and finally the non - collective coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 .    the collective coordinate is determined by means of the solution to the local harmonic approach , which consists of a set of self - consistent equations .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "the force equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the zero - modes ( also called nambu - goldstone or spurious modes ) and @xmath30 represents a set of lagrange multipliers ( which in nuclear physics are sometimes called cranking parameters ) .",
    "@xmath31 is a lagrange multiplier for the collective mode , stabilising the system away from equilibrium ( we shall often call it the generalised cranking parameter ) .",
    "2 .   the local rpa equation @xmath32 where the covariant derivative @xmath33 is defined in the usual way ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "zero modes correspond to zero eigenvalues of the rpa . in principle",
    "great care needs to be taken to have zero modes behave correctly away from equilibrium .",
    "the symplectic rpa  @xcite is the correct way to do so ; unfortunately it is rather cumbersome .",
    "below we will discuss an alternative approach to remove the admixture of spurious solution in an approximate scheme .",
    "the collective path is found by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : force1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : localrpa1 ] ) self - consistently , i.e. , we look for a path consisting of a series of points where the lowest non - spurious eigenvector of the local rpa equations also fulfils the force condition .",
    "the motion along this line does not necessarily decouple from other degrees of freedom , but we have a `` decoupling measure '' @xmath35 , that measures how good or bad this coupling is . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it measures the change of non - collective coordinates for a change in the collective one , which must be zero for exact decoupling . in the minimum of the potential",
    "the spurious solutions decouple from the other collective and non - collective solutions , and spurious admixtures are absent .",
    "this is not true for other points along the collective path , especially when approximations are made  @xcite , see the further discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : spur ] .",
    "we apply the lha to the pairing+quadrupole hamiltonian as described in  @xcite . with a constraint on both angular momentum and particle numbers",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are spherical single - particle energies , @xmath38 are the particle number operators , @xmath39 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath40 is the dimensionless quadrupole operator @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the standard oscillator length and @xmath43 is the ( dimensionless ) pairing operator @xmath44 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hpq1][eq : p1 ] ) @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) are the single particle creation ( destruction ) operators , where @xmath47 labels a set of quantum numbers .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hpq1 ] ) is treated in the hartree - bogoliubov approximation and it has been shown that at the minimum the local rpa for this hamiltonian is equivalent to the quasi - particle rpa .",
    "the spherical single - particle energies are calculated from a modified spherical oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the interaction strengths ( see table  [ tab : kappag ] ) are chosen to give realistic values of the deformation and pairing gaps in the ground states .",
    ".the interaction strengths used in the calculations . [ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     kr as a function of angular momentum.,width=302 ]    in this case , fig .",
    "[ fig : kr78ei ] , the spectrum is somewhat similar to @xmath1se , due to the extreme @xmath48-soft character of the @xmath49 states . in this case one of the two excited @xmath49 states has actually been detected .",
    "the data obtained in these difficult experiments are not of sufficient quality to rule out that this is actually a narrow doublet .",
    "the data on @xmath50 states is also compatible with an additional low - lying @xmath50 that has not been seen in experiment .",
    "we have extended the method of calculating the self - consistent collective path presented in  @xcite to include constraints on angular momentum and particle number and implemented it for the quadrupole+pairing hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the method consists of finding a series of points fulfilling the force equation , where the local direction of the collective path is determined in each point by the local normal modes .",
    "the local rpa equations and the force equation are solved in a double iterative process with constraints on angular momentum and particle numbers along the collective path .",
    "the method allows us to determine the collective coordinate from the hamiltonian without having to assume a priori which are the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the results confirm the importance of pairing collapsed states for the collective path as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "we have also seen a very different behaviour of the collective path between the prolate and oblate minimum depending on @xmath51 and @xmath52 as well as weather we are looking at the ground state or an rotating state . without rotation the path either goes through a spherical maximum or through the triaxial plane . in the rotating case",
    "the two minima are always connected via the triaxial plane .",
    "this difference comes because at finite angular momentum the system tries to avoid the spherical state because the cost of generating angular momentum gets larger as the deformation gets smaller .",
    "this effect would not have been seen so clearly if the calculation was done at constant rotational frequency instead of at constant angular momentum .",
    "the difference would be less pronounced if we would have allowed for more the one collective coordinate .",
    "the results shed new light on the behaviour of these nuclei , and make predictions which can be of importance experimentally , especially the extreme @xmath48-soft nature of @xmath1se and @xmath4kr at low angular momentum .",
    "discovery of the predicted doublets of excited @xmath49 states would shed light on the nature of shape mixing in these nuclei .",
    "it is extremely encouraging that where we expect our method to be reliable ( i.e. , where @xmath35 is small ) we get a good correspondence with experiment , and where we have a poor correspondence , decoupling is poor .",
    "we have also seen that the nature of shape - mixing and shape - coexistence is indeed quite complicated in the group of nuclei discussed here , and changes rapidly along the isotope chain .",
    "the picture seems to be less systematic than discussed in the literature .",
    "mixing is large in all cases .    in this paper",
    "we have implemented a method to find the adiabatic self - consistent collective path for a nuclei . a technique to truncate the basis in which the rpa equations are solved has been improved and a good agreement between the full and truncated rpa is found . to solve the rpa equations in a limited basis",
    "has proven to be a useful and practical way of calculating the collective path within the local harmonic approximation .",
    "it remains to be investigated how we can include the covariant terms in the rpa in a suitable approximation .",
    "this work was supported by the uk engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc )",
    "in the work of matsuo _ at al . _ , the adiabatic large amplitude collective motion ( alacm )",
    "is described in what looks superficially entirely different than our method . nonetheless , the final results are so similar that there must be similarities .",
    "it is therefore useful to analyse the problem in various ways and compare the two methods in a unified notation .",
    "the key difference is the direct formulation in terms of mean field equations by matsuo _",
    "et al . _ , and our insistance on classical mechanics .",
    "let us initially look at one way to derive the localised harmonic approach in our notation , which we shall than tie closely to the work in ref .",
    "we expand the collective energy ( actually the generalised density matrix ) to second order in small fluctuations , thus obtaining a hamiltonian .",
    "the method is based on `` removing the linear terms '' , which means that at any point @xmath53 , which is really a time - even hfb state , along the collective path , we approximate the hamiltonian by the quadratic form @xmath54 in order to look at the local fluctuations , we need to remove the term linear in @xmath55 .",
    "we first modify @xmath56 by constraints ( such as those for particle number and angular momentum ; we shall include particle number only here ) . with the lagrange multiplier term @xmath57 we really have @xmath58 in order to remove the linear term",
    ", we require that it can be removed by purely collective term , i.e. , a term of the form @xmath59 , with @xmath60 defined at the collective point @xmath61 .",
    "we thus require that @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and we get the quadratic hamiltonian ( where we have absorbed the terms arising from expanding @xmath64 for fixed @xmath65 in @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and denoted the compound object by a tilde ) .",
    "the hamiltonian with the constraint @xmath59 becomes @xmath68 it has been argued coherently in ref .",
    "@xcite that the final term is equivalent to the covariant term in the derivative @xmath69 and we are now left with a simple normal mode problem , which is of course nothing more than the usual rpa .",
    "the self - consistency is now obtained by requiring @xmath70 to be one of the normal mode directions .",
    "we thus can write the rpa as two coupled equation ( or as a single one ) and @xmath71 in the notation of ref .  @xcite . ] @xmath72    let us now compare this approach with that of @xcite , which is cast in the form of a set of variational equations .",
    "if we take into account that to first order the time - even part of fluctuations is @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the time - odd part , it is relatively straight - forward to show that the three equations ( 2.34 - 2.36 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite would be written as + ( * note : *    * we use @xmath65 where ref .",
    "@xcite uses @xmath60 ; * in our notation @xmath75 , where we use the bar to denote a collective quantity , as distinguished from the quantity defined in the full space @xcite . *",
    "@xmath76 . * @xmath77 . )",
    "the first of these relations is the one that removes the linear term , as above .",
    "the second defines the collective momentum , and finally the last equation defines the affine connection @xmath79 , @xmath80 exactly the same relation can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "whereas in the local fluctuation approach we construct fluctuations in all directions , the work in ref .",
    "@xcite differentiates only with respect to the collective coordinates .",
    "this implies an assumption about block - diagonality of @xmath81 that is justified for exact decoupling .",
    "we get for eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath82 -\\mu_{,q } n_{,\\alpha}=0\\ ] ] this can also be rewritten as ( using @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) @xmath85 which is almost what we would argue constitutes the covariant rpa equation , cf .",
    "( [ eq : apcrpa2 ] ) .",
    "there is a very subtle difference , and that is due to the fact that the matrix on the left - hand - side in [ eq : apv3 ] is not symmetric under interchange of the labels @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the term that is missing as compared to the local fluctuation approach discussed above is @xmath88 .",
    "the absence comes from treating @xmath89 in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite as an external parameter , whereas , in the language of that paper , we take @xmath90 , i.e. , as a function of the mean - field expectation value of @xmath91 , which clearly changes with the mean field , and thus leads to the additional term .",
    "we believe that symmetry of all the rpa equations is crucial , and thus are worried about such missing terms .",
    "of course , in the current paper we have grossly neglected all covariant terms , which clearly is also objectionable .",
    "we do wonder , however , if this lack of symmetry is what leads to the @xmath92-symmetry non - preserving path seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . without angular momentum constraints , the local rpa for axial states",
    "will _ always _ have eigenvalues with definite @xmath93 , i.e. , to change from following a @xmath87 to a @xmath48 vibration , we must have a real rather than avoided crossing in the rpa .",
    "the further developments in ref .",
    "@xcite are also interesting ; they correspond to trying to evaluate @xmath94 , the variation of the collective coordinate operator . even if it were a one body operator , as we tacitly assume , and is necessary for exact decoupling , the equations only fix the 2 quasi - particle part of this operator , i.e. , terms going like @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "the approximation made in ref .",
    "@xcite is to assume that the @xmath97 matrix elements are identically zero .",
    "this is the only closed form approximation that can be made , but must be dealt with carefully : it would fail for some problems with exact decoupling . in an approach that uses a basis of operators",
    ", one could evaluate such terms by the relevant matrix elements of the operators , multiplied by their coefficients @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the underlying expressions in our approach and that set out in ref .",
    "@xcite are almost , and should be completely , identical .",
    "we are concerned about the missing term in the potential expansion .",
