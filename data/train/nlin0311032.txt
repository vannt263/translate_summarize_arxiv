    "about one percent of the united states adult population is afflicted with bipolar disorder ( manic depression),@xcite which poses myriad difficulties to clinical practitioners .",
    "it is difficult to diagnose , as bipolar patients often do not adhere to treatment and/or medication , and most drugs can be toxic if taken individually.@xcite the available data on bipolar disorder is sparse  due in part to a lack of agreement on well - suited trial design  so it is very difficult to study using clinical trials.@xcite    psychiatrists have established a broad range of criteria for classifying bipolar disorder ; see , for example , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , fourth edition ( dsm iv).@xcite its characteristics , which need not all be present in every bipolar individual , include _ mixed episodes _ ,",
    "in which it is possible to simultaneously experience symptoms of both mania and depression , and _ rapid cycling _ , in which a patient experiences at least four cycles per year.@xcite    there are two primary types of bipolar disorder .",
    "_ bipolar i disorder _ is characterized by a combination of manic and depressive episodes with the possibility of mixed episodes , whereas _ bipolar ii disorder _",
    "is characterized by a combination of hypomania and depressive episodes.@xcite bipolar ii patients tend to be more prone to rapid cycling  especially if initially treated only with antidepressants.@xcite in this paper , we focus on bipolar ii disorder for two reasons .",
    "first , individuals who suffer from it are more often observed to exhibit approximately periodic mood swings than bipolar i individuals .",
    "second , bipolar ii individuals do not experience mixed episodes .",
    "bipolar ii disorder is often misdiagnosed as either unipolar depression or a severe personality disorder.@xcite to be correctly diagnosed , a patient seeking treatment must give an accurate description of his past behavior . because of the nature of hypomanic episodes ( increased energy , decreased need for sleep , _ etc .",
    "_ ) patients often do not describe these conditions to doctors and are therefore diagnosed with unipolar depression.@xcite according to the results of the national depressive and manic - depressive association 2000 survey of people with bipolar disorder , over one third of respondents sought professional help within a year of onset of symptoms .",
    "however , it took as many as ten years and four physicians for some patients to be correctly diagnosed.@xcite    treatment for bipolar disorder ideally includes a combination of medication and therapy .",
    "typical drug treatments include mood stabilizers , antipsychotics , antidepressants , and select anticonvulsants . among the more commonly used drugs are lithium ,",
    "valproate ( also know as depakote ) , carbamazepine ( also known as tegretol ) , and prozac .",
    "mood controlling drugs such as lithium take four to ten days to reach therapeutic levels in the blood stream , so initial treatment is likely to include both antidepressants and antipsychotics.@xcite during the maintenance state , antidepressants and antipsychotics are generally supplemented by mood stabilizers .",
    "monotherapy ( i.e. , single - drug therapy ) is generally avoided by clinicians because of the strong side effects of some of the drugs used for treatment .",
    "other drugs that have been employed include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssri ) and monoamineoxidase inhibitors ( maoi ) , both of which are typically used for depression . in some cases",
    ", special care must be taken to ensure that a bipolar individual does not fall into a pattern of rapid cycling or become addicted to the medication used for treatment .",
    "in fact , substance abuse has been associated with bipolar disorder.@xcite    bipolar ii disorder is also known to be highly heritable .",
    "it has been reported , for example , that the offspring of people with bipolar ii disorder have a @xmath0 percent chance of being afflicted as well .",
    "in particular , there are known cases of family units with multiple bipolar ii individuals , so the dynamics of interacting bipolar patients is also of interest to psychologists.@xcite    in this paper , we propose and examine two mathematical models that attempt to represent the qualitative dynamics of individual bipolar patients .",
    "we also consider a closely interacting pair of bipolar patients ( which can occur , for example , in households with bipolar sibling pairs@xcite ) .",
    "the importance of the present work is that it suggests ways of thinking about bipolar disorder . in particular , mathematical models",
    "have the potential to provide significant insight into this disorder , provided there is adequate data to constrain the models .",
    "studies using time - series analysis ( of a relatively small number of bipolar and normal individuals ) suggest that relatively simple mechanisms may be responsible for the complex mood variations in bipolar disorder.@xcite the models we develop provide a first step toward using mathematical modeling to increase scientific understanding of this disorder .",
    "ultimately , our models will need refinement to allow greater predictability and ties to candidate biological processes .",
    "our hope is for the present work to motivate the collection of the additional time - series data necessary to achieve this goal .",
    "numerous research articles discuss bipolar disorder , focusing primarily on clinical trials and case studies .",
    "unfortunately , very little of this prior research is amenable to mathematical treatment , whose employment could prove vital in advancing our knowledge of this medical condition.@xcite nevertheless , several studies of bipolar disorder  including a recent comprehensive article by judd , _ et al . _ ( 2003)characterize the moods of bipolar patients in terms of the fraction of weeks during a year when particular symptoms were ( or were not ) displayed.@xcite while the models we examine in the present paper can also be interpreted in these terms , a weekly or daily time - series description of the symptoms could inspire the creation or modification of mathematical models that may shed additional light on the underlying dynamics of bipolar disorder .",
    "for example , early work by wehr and goodwin ( which demonstrates oscillatory behavior in the moods of bipolar individuals ) could be used , in principle , to help refine our mathematical framework .",
    "however , their time - series description included only one bipolar patient , so its practical utility in the development of a mathematical description of bipolar ii disorder is limited.@xcite    a comprehensive study ( with a large number of clinical trials ) like that of judd , _ et al .",
    "_ that uses the time - series format of wehr and goodwin could lead to far more realistic mathematical models than the available data currently allows .",
    "although arduous , such an undertaking would yield important advancements in modeling and understanding bipolar disorder .",
    "our goal in this paper is considerably more modest  we use dynamical systems theory to develop minimalist models of bipolar ii disorder that we hope will lead to additional qualitative understanding of the behavioral oscillations associated with this medical condition .",
    "the novelty of our work lies in our mathematical approach to the modeling of bipolar disorder .",
    "although there exist biological models for this medical condition , mathematical equations have never ( to our knowledge ) previously been employed to study bipolar individuals . in this work ,",
    "we propose and analyze two mathematical models of bipolar ii disorder . rather than focusing on the method of diagnosis ( which is a difficult medical problem )",
    ", we instead concentrate on the dynamics of our models under the proposed treatment strategy , which is understood to involve a combination of drugs and/or therapy .",
    "the models we study are not meant to represent a specific treatment but are instead intended to provide some insight into the complicated dynamics of bipolar disorder . in this respect , we consider our work to be a first step in developing mathematical models of the mood swings of bipolar individuals .",
    "the shift in thinking from a statistical model to a nonlinear mathematical model for mood variations has been suggested by some authors , including totterdell _",
    "et al._@xcite additionally , ehlers@xcite and gottschalk , _",
    "et al._@xcite have noted the importance of nonlinear and chaotic dynamics and the employment of simple models incorporating such features to achieve better understanding of mood and behavior .",
    "in fact , the latter authors attempted to identify and quantify the nonlinear behavior in the mood of bipolar patients by using time - series analysis to study power spectra and fractal dimension .",
    "however , they did not attempt to develop mathematical equations to model mood swings in bipolar individuals ( although they did speculate that utilizing van der pol oscillators may be useful ) , which is the goal of this work . in this respect ,",
    "our theoretical work nicely complements the data analysis of gottschalk , _",
    "et al_.    reinterpreting the time series results of totterdell , _ et al . _ and gathering similar time series data for bipolar patients has considerable merit .",
    "we hope that our work in developing dynamical equations describing the mood swings of bipolar individuals , in conjunction with additional studies like those of totterdell , _ et al . _ and gottschalk , _ et al .",
    "_ , leads to the eventual development of more detailed models that incorporate clinical data from both bipolar and  normal \" individuals .",
    "numerous studies have proposed possible underlying mechanisms for bipolar disorder , and some have even examined the effect of light stimuli and seasonal variations .",
    "potentially insightful mathematical models can be motivated from such work , but the perspective we take is to employ minimalist mathematical models describing biological and physical oscillators that assume _ a priori _ the existence of asymptotic oscillations ( i.e. , limit cycles).@xcite this allows us to gain insight into the dynamics of the mood swings of bipolar ii individuals , despite the fact that the underlying dynamics are not fully understood at the level of chemicals in the body .",
    "this kind of minimalist perspective has been employed successfully to study , for example , the circadian rhythms of the avian chick eye and the dynamics of coupled microwave oscillators.@xcite    minimalist models of this sort are not intended to suggest the mechanisms that underly a given phenomenon but rather to gain a qualitative understanding of the dynamics of the existing mechanisms ( especially in situations , like this one , in which they are not known or poorly understood ) .",
    "we also hope that our work will spur the data collection necessary to develop more realistic mathematical models that can be tied closer to the application at hand .",
    "mathematical studies have the potential to help our understanding of bipolar disorder considerably , but a lot more work must be done to reach that stage .",
    "this paper is intended to be a first step along that path .",
    "for modeling purposes , some simplifying assumptions are necessary . first ,",
    "although bipolar ii disorder can be somewhat erratic , episodes are known to exhibit recurrent patterns . for a group of patients with this disorder",
    ", there is a periodicity governing the manic and depressive episodes.@xcite moreover , it is commonly assumed that the disorder will progress severely if left untreated .",
    "as previously mentioned , we are not attempting to provide an explanation of the underlying mechanisms of bipolar disorder ( although we hope that we can provide a stepping - stone toward achieving this highly desirable objective ) .",
    "rather , our immediate goal is to better understand the dynamics of the mood swings by assuming _ a priori _ the existence of an oscillator or oscillators that might approximate the observed behavior of bipolar individuals .",
    "figure 2 in early work by wehr and goodwin suggests that the behavior of the single bipolar patient they studied can be described qualitatively as a limit cycle oscillator.@xcite moreover , a typical bipolar patient undergoes roughly four symptom changes per year , which corresponds roughly to observations of wehr and goodwin.@xcite the rapid cycling that occurs under the treatment of desipramine hydrochloride also lends itself to a mathematical interpretation in terms of limit cycle oscillators .",
    "our analysis provides insight into how these limit cycle oscillations are induced with treatment .",
    "as hypomanic and depressive episodes are periodic and  if untreated  increase in severity over time , one can model the mood and mood change of an untreated individual using a negatively damped harmonic oscillator , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the emotional state of the patient , @xmath3 is the rate of mood changes between hypomania and severe depression , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are parameters .",
    "the main drawback of such a simple model is its unbounded oscillations .",
    "most patients with bipolar ii disorder are diagnosed when they are in a depressive episode , as hypomania ordinarily does not prevent the normal function of individuals .",
    "( mania , in contrast , causes significant occupational and social discomfort . ) in many cases , hypomania can even enhance short - term functionality.@xcite because it often takes several years for bipolar disorder to be properly diagnosed , we assume treatment begins when a patient is in his early 20s . we also suppose that treatment can be modeled using an autonomous forcing function ( although nonautonomous forcing , involving time - periodic functions such as a sequence of delta functions or trigonometric functions , is also worth considering ) .",
    "the inclusion of this forcing term turns equation ( [ negatively damped harmonic oscillator ] ) into the well - known van der pol oscillator , @xmath6    the forcing function @xmath7 represents aggregate treatment and includes a combination of antidepressants , mood stabilizers , psychotherapy , and either antipsychotics or tranquilizers .",
    "finding the correct way to treat a given patient may take as many as ten to fifteen trials on different medications .",
    "the most comprehensive treatment , however , involves both medication and psychotherapy.@xcite    one can suppose equation ( [ vdpol ] ) describes a treated bipolar individual , as it possesses a unique stable limit cycle surrounding the origin.@xcite it is a specific example of a more general class of equations of the form @xmath8 which is known as the linard equation .",
    "the presence of a limit cycle indicates that after treatment , the bipolar patient s mood variations ( asymptotically ) oscillate within a range of @xmath2 values to be determined by the parameters in equation ( [ vdpol ] ) .",
    "although this simplistic model gives some insight into the dynamical properties of periodic mood variations of bipolar individuals , the characterization of untreated individuals is not realistic because of the unbounded oscillations ( mood swings ) that result from every initial condition .",
    "we thus seek a model that not only captures the behavior of treated bipolar ii individuals , but also does a better job of capturing the dynamics of untreated individuals .      in this model",
    ", we use a van der pol oscillator@xcite to represent an untreated bipolar ii individual .",
    "this characterization is more realistic than that in equation ( [ negatively damped harmonic oscillator ] ) , as the mood swings of an untreated patient can still grow large but now approach a bounded limit cycle rather than eventually becoming infinitely severe .",
    "we again apply treatment in the form of an autonomous forcing function @xmath9 , @xmath10 in our analysis , we used @xmath11 for our simulations , we considered the case @xmath12 , but one can apply a medication of the more general form ( [ medgen ] ) to adjust the coefficient @xmath13 .    because normal individuals also have mood swings , one must designate how severe such mood variation must be in order for someone to be diagnosed as bipolar .",
    "in other words , only limit cycles with some minimal amplitude ( say , @xmath14 ) correspond to bipolar mood swings . in an untreated patient described by ( [ medicated ] ) with @xmath15 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 lead to a limit cycle with an amplitude of approximately @xmath19 , as shown in figures [ graph3 ] and [ graph4 ] . in the context of the present model ,",
    "such an amplitude threshold dividing functional individuals from bipolar ii ones is arbitrary , so the scales in ( [ medicated ] ) can be adjusted to account for individuals who suffer from bipolar disorder to varying degree ( e.g. , individuals who have mania rather than hypomania ) .    , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to a stable limit cycle with an amplitude of about @xmath20 , which we designate as larger than that describing ` normal ' mood swings . ]    .",
    "this describes the relationship between the individual s moods and how fast they change . ]",
    "starting with the van der pol oscillator caricature of the untreated patient , we apply the forcing function @xmath21 to represent medication .",
    "we use ( [ medicated ] ) to represent a treated bipolar ii patient , who possesses an unstable , large limit cycle ( greater than the @xmath22 amplitude , which is the threshold that we have chosen for ` normal ' behavior ) and a stable , small limit cycle . choosing @xmath23 , @xmath17 , and @xmath24 yields the plots in figures [ graph5 ] and [ graph6 ] .    using the method of averaging,@xcite we study the number and amplitude ( denoted @xmath25 ) of the limit cycles of equation ( [ medicated ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath25 are described by _ slow flow _",
    "equations of motion , whose non - zero equilibria correspond to limit cycles of equation ( [ medicated ] ) .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters , there can be zero , one , or two limit cycles .",
    "the slow flow equations for the amplitude contain both positive and negative equilibria , but only the non - negative solutions are relevant to the original dynamical system .",
    "limit - cycle amplitudes must satisfy @xmath26 once we find the limit cycle amplitudes , we compute the jacobian ( in this case , the second derivative ) to determine their stability as functions of @xmath27 , @xmath13 , and @xmath28 .",
    "there is always a slow - flow equilibrium at @xmath29 , which corresponds to the equilibrium at @xmath30 of ( [ medicated ] ) .",
    "we obtain the following conditions for the existence and stability of limit cycles :    1 .",
    "zero limit cycles occur when either @xmath31 ( so that @xmath32 is not real ) or @xmath27 , @xmath13 , and @xmath28 all have the same sign ( so that @xmath33 ) . in these cases , there are no slow - flow equilibria with positive @xmath25 .",
    "one limit cycle : * there is one limit cycle when @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "there is a bifurcation at this point ( corresponding to the coalescence of two limit cycles ) , and stability can not be determined by computing a jacobian .",
    "* there is one limit cycle when @xmath36 , regardless of the sign of @xmath37 .",
    "this occurs exactly when @xmath38 .",
    "such a limit cycle is always unstable .",
    "* there is one limit cycle when @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in this situation ,",
    "the jacobian is @xmath41 , so the limit cycle is stable if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "two limit cycles occur if @xmath40 and @xmath43 .",
    "this happens for @xmath44 when @xmath45 and for @xmath46 when @xmath47 . in the biologically relevant situation describing a treated individual ,",
    "the smaller limit cycle is stable .",
    "an example of this is depicted in figures [ graph5 ] and [ graph6 ] with the parameter values @xmath48 , @xmath17 , and @xmath49 .    , @xmath50 , and @xmath49 , which yields an unstable limit cycle with amplitude greater than @xmath22 and a stable limit cycle with amplitude less than @xmath51 this patient begins to receive treatment at about age @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "individuals usually first become bipolar between the ages of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , but the onset of bipolar disorder can occur in early childhood.@xcite . ]    .",
    "the depicted trajectory approaches the smaller ( stable ) limit cycle as the time @xmath56 increases .",
    "the amplitude of this limit cycle is less than @xmath14 , so it describes the mood swings of a functional individual . ]      the introduction of a forcing function ( representing treatment ) to model i results in smaller mood swings ; in so doing , however , a larger unstable limit cycle was introduced .",
    "this has the potential drawback of predicting that if an individual goes too long without being diagnosed ( and thus the amplitude of the mood swings is too large ) , one would need to ensure that the initial condition when treatment begins is within the basin of attraction of the smaller stable limit cycle . in other words ,",
    "if the mood swings are too large , it might be necessary to drastically reduce the mood amplitude before introducing ` normal ' treatment .",
    "model 2 provides an alternative minimalist framework to study bipolar ii disorder that does not have this drawback .",
    "in this situation , we will demonstrate the presence of three limit cycles .",
    "we will also show that the ones with the largest and smallest amplitude are stable , whereas the limit cycle between them is unstable . toward this end",

    "the initial condition lies inside the limit cycle and thus represents an individual who gradually worsens over time . ]    in considering the role of treatment @xmath21 in this model , we note that @xmath68 is the key parameter that will be adjusted . for a treated patient , the value @xmath69 ( for example ) yields qualitatively appropriate dynamics . a treated bipolar ii patient is then modeled by @xmath70 this model encompasses all aspects of treatment as a single function @xmath71 . in figure",
    "[ phaset ] , we see that by inputting the new initial conditions into the model that includes treatment , the patient exhibits favorable emotional patterns . there is a large stable limit cycle and an unstable limit cycle just inside it .",
    "a smaller stable limit cycle is the desired emotional pattern of the patient ; all initial conditions lying inside the large unstable cycle yield solutions that spiral toward this smaller cycle , whose amplitude is sufficiently small so that the associated mood swings are deemed normal .",
    "one gets the same qualitative behavior with smaller @xmath72 ( such as @xmath73 ) , although the separation between the unstable limit cycle and the larger stable limit cycle surrounding it becomes larger as @xmath72 is decreased .",
    "the chosen value of @xmath68 yields limit cycles that are almost on top of each other ; increasing @xmath72 destroys this qualitative structure .",
    "the larger limit cycle prevents a treated patient from having unbounded mood variations that could otherwise occur , for example , if a perturbation were to make the current mood amplitude too large .",

    ", the amplitude of the mood swings stays relatively close to @xmath74 .",
    "it then tends asymptotically to the stable limit cycle , where the mood @xmath2 varies between approximately @xmath75 .",
    "an important feature of the model demonstrated in figure [ phaset ] is that treatment can begin at any time because the small limit cycle attracts all solutions that lie inside the unstable limit cycle .",

    "given that individuals are usually diagnosed in the depressive state and that bipolar disorder is frequently misdiagnosed initially , this aspect of model 1 is especially noteworthy.@xcite    model 2 provides an alternative framework in which a bipolar ii individual possesses two stable limit cycles even without treatment ; satisfactory treatment then confines the patient to the one with smaller amplitude .",
    "the rapid cycling induced by desiramine hydrochloride that was reported by wehr and goodwin@xcite can be interpreted as a slight increase in the amplitude of the oscillation but  more centrally  as an increase in the oscillation frequency .",

    "individuals suffering from the latter disorder rapidly flip back and forth between depressed and euphoric moods .",
    "their high and low periods , which are relatively short , are much less intense than those of bipolar individuals .",
    "although it is not known precisely what leads individuals from one pole to the other , possible causes include psychosocial stress , disrupted sleep patterns , or some endogenous or internal biological mechanism that is not connected to environmental stimuli.@xcite it is also not known what happens to cycling over time .",
    "it is speculated that an individual s cycling may slow down with age . from a mathematical perspective",
    ", we wish to highlight that the effects of disrupted sleep patterns can be studied by coupling a cyclothymic ( or bipolar ) individual with a limit - cycle oscillator representing the human sleep - wake cycle.@xcite    another important issue to consider is the threshold for flipping poles .",
    "it has been theorized , for example , that the threshold for depression ( and for flipping poles ) gets lower over time .",
    "it has been speculated ( by robert post@xcite , for example ) that the longer one is ill , the more autonomous or disconnected episodes become from the environment .",
    "this is termed `` kindling theory '' and is believed to be analogous to what happens in epilepsy , in which there is a gradual kindling of biological disturbances in the brain that eventually surpasses the threshold for a seizure .",
    "in this paper , we provide a mathematical framework for the modeling of bipolar disorder in terms of low - dimensional limit cycle oscillators . we propose and analyze two phenomenological models of bipolar individuals . rather than focusing on the method of diagnosis , which is a difficult medical problem , we instead concentrate on the dynamics of our models under the proposed treatment strategy , which involves a combination of drugs and therapy .",
    "the purpose of our modeling efforts is not to suggest a specific treatment for bipolar individuals but rather to provide some insight into the complicated dynamics of bipolar disorder . in this respect",
    ", we view our work as a first step in developing mathematical models of the mood swings of bipolar individuals .",
    "our intent is to provide a mathematical framework that ultimately leads to the development of more detailed models of bipolar disorder that incorporate clinical data . with this work ,",
    "we hope to motivate the collection of time - series data from clinical trials that will lead to refinements of our model that incorporate such data . in our view",
    ", dynamical systems theory and mathematical modeling in general can lead to important advancements in the understanding of bipolar disorder .",
