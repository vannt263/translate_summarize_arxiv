    "[ ] for comparison . while we could not observe any systematic dependence in previous data ( see open symbols ) we see a clear increase of the spin resistance with increasing @xmath75 in all present devices ( see full symbols in fig .",
    "although these seemingly inconsistent results might be surprising , they again demonstrate that spin and charge transport parameters are governed by many microscopic parameters and details which are currently not completely unveiled .",
    "in this section we first address the question if the measured spin lifetime is also influenced by the oxygen doping of the graphene flake . in this context , it is important to note that doping of graphene by oxygen occurs on much shorter time scales than our treatment time of and saturates eventually.@xcite because of this saturation , the position of the right cnp which results from the contact - free graphene part between the contacts is almost the same for both oxidation steps in device b ( figs .  [",
    "fig : fig6](a ) and [ fig : fig6](e ) ) .",
    "therefore , the increase in spin lifetime in both regions after the second oxygen treatment has to be related to the change in contact resistance and not to oxygen doping .",
    "we also repeated the measurements of device b after the first oxidation step twice after keeping the device in vacuum for 48  h in each case .",
    "apparently , part of the less bound oxygen gets released as both cnps are shifting in gate voltage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](a ) ) .",
    "in contrast , the differential contact resistance ( not shown ) , the spin lifetime ( green triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](c ) ) and the spin diffusion coefficient ( green triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](d ) ) do not change . accordingly , oxygen doping of the graphene flake does not considerably influence the spin lifetime at room temperature .",
    "only the spin signal is slightly increased after partial oxygen loss in vacuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](b ) ) .",
    "it is important to note that the spin signal and the spin lifetime can develop differently , in particular if the oxygen treatment is carried out at higher temperatures .",
    "the heating of the device during oxidation was an attempt to accelerate the oxidization process .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is that the device can easily be damaged .",
    "we found that annealing temperatures larger than often result in strongly reduced or completely vanishing spin signals although the electrical contact over the graphene flake is rather robust during that treatment . in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig9](a ) and [ fig : fig9](b ) we plot the change in spin resistance and spin lifetime in a separate slg device e after two oxygen treatments , respectively . in agreement with all the other devices , room temperature oxidization for 130",
    "h yields an increase in both @xmath84 and @xmath65 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath84 decreases to the initial values after the second oxygen treatment at .",
    "notably , the spin lifetime increases after each treatment demonstrating that different mechanisms influence both spin transport parameters .",
    "to back - up our claim that the increase in spin lifetime is not caused by oxygen doping of graphene , we finally show results for device f ( slg ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig9](c ) and [ fig : fig9](d ) .",
    "this device has transparent contacts and was exposed to oxygen only for one hour but with an applied gate voltage of @xmath85 . an applied gate electric field during oxygen exposure",
    "is known to enhance the doping efficiency of oxygen.@xcite accordingly , the cnp of the device is significantly shifted by to the right . on the other hand ,",
    "the exposure time is too short to effectively change the mgo / graphene interface as seen by the single cnp without even an onset of the contact - induced cnp at negative gate voltages . despite the significant carrier doping by oxygen we therefore neither observe any notable change in the spin signal ( not shown ) nor in the spin lifetime [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](d ) ] .",
    "in this section we discuss possible oxidization mechanisms at the graphene / mgo / co interface during oxygen treatment and develop implications on spin and charge transport properties .",
    "previously , it was reported that the interface between metallic electrodes made out of al , co and cu to exfoliated graphene can be belatedly oxidized by exposing the as - fabricated devices to air for a sufficient period of time.@xcite it has been argued that the weak bonding between graphene and these metals may lead to sideways diffusion of oxygen along the metal - to - graphene interface.@xcite this notion is underpinned by time - resolved low energy electron microscopy studies in which the oxidization of a ru(0001)-single crystal covered by graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition is shown.@xcite    if oxygen diffuses from the edges of the contacts it is obvious to assume that oxidization of wider contacts is less efficient and thus takes longer time than for narrower contacts .",
    "but as discussed in sec .",
    "[ oxygen_treatments]b we observe significant variations in the oxidization efficiency of even equally dimensioned electrodes . these might also result from different couplings of the graphene flake to the underlying substrate.@xcite it was reported that exfoliated graphene flakes do not necessarily completely follow the surface roughness of a @xmath5 substrate@xcite and therefore different diffusion behaviors of water and gases along the graphene - to-@xmath5 interface have been proposed.@xcite the question arises whether these spatial variations in the coupling to the substrate may also influence the post - oxidization of the mgo barriers and can explain the observed differences in the efficiency of the oxygen treatments presented in this work .    it is likely that spatially varying lithography residues between graphene and the deposited electrodes may significantly influence oxygen diffusion along the interface .",
    "furthermore , a high resolution tem image ( not shown ) of one of our as - fabricated devices shows the polycrystalline structure of the mgo barrier which is not surprising when considering the growth mode described in sec .",
    "[ fabrication ] .",
    "such a polycrystalline barrier has defects and grain boundaries , which enhance the reactivity of mgo@xmath10 and may also support diffusion of oxygen.@xcite moreover , only a rather small amount of additional oxygen is needed to reach the graphene / mgo / co interface in order to compensate possible oxygen vacancies in the mgo@xmath10 barrier and to oxidize conducting pinholes which both improve the barrier quality .",
    "the existence of pinholes in the as - fabricated devices not only explains the surprisingly small measured contact resistances ( see sec .  [ oxygen_treatments]a ) but also the absence of the contact - induced second cnp and even the very small spin lifetimes . at the position of pinholes the graphene is in close contact with co atoms .",
    "it has been theoretically predicted that co gets chemisorbed on graphene and modifies its band structure to a large extent.@xcite angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of cvd - grown graphene on co substrates demonstrates that the dirac cone is significantly shifted into the valence band and that the @xmath86 band of graphene hybridizes with the 3__d _ _ bands of co near the fermi level.@xcite on the one hand , these pronounced hybridization states can explain why the fermi level gets pinned and prohibits gate voltage tunability in graphene underneath transparent co electrodes .",
    "but on the other hand it is important to emphasize that charge and spin transport takes place through these hybridized states . therefore spin scattering induced by the hybridized 3__d _ _ states may explain the very short spin lifetimes .",
    "in this context it would be interesting to explore whether the pinholes may behave like spin hot spots which were recently proposed for hydrogen adatoms on graphene as a very efficient source for resonant spin scattering yielding short spin lifetimes.@xcite    by our oxygen treatments the pinholes are electrically pinched off and the overall thickness of the oxide barrier increases which leads to a weakening of the co / graphene interaction . as a result",
    "both the _ n_-doping and the density of hybridized 3__d _ _ states near the fermi level get gradually diminished .",
    "this eventually leads to the appearance of the second charge neutrality point at large negative gate voltages and the increase in spin lifetime .",
    "accordingly both dirac peaks should be merging as soon as a continuous oxide barrier of sufficient thickness leads to a decoupling between graphene and co assuming that the mgo does not cause any additional doping .",
    "based on these arguments we now propose a model which explains the strong increase of the spin lifetime at the contact - induced charge neutrality point of device b [ figs .  [ fig : fig6](a ) and [ fig : fig6](b ) ] .",
    "we assume that in the as - fabricated condition the mgo barrier is oxygen deficient ( mgo@xmath10 with @xmath11 according to sec .",
    "[ fabrication ] ) and contains conducting pinholes over the whole contact area as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : fig10](a ) .",
    "accordingly , the applied current will primarily flow through the areas of the pinholes ( see white arrows ) .",
    "the doping profile of the electrostatic potential in the graphene is illustrated for the case that the gate voltage is tuned to the cnp of the bare graphene parts on the left and on the right side of the electrode ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](a ) for as - fabricated device ( black curve ) with @xmath87 ) .",
    "the graphene under the electrode and in particular at the positions of the pinholes is highly",
    "_ n_-doped because of the interaction with the co. while the fermi level of the outer graphene parts can be tuned by the gate voltage , it remains pinned under the contact due to the hybridized states [ see also schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) ]",
    ". therefore no pronounced gate dependence of the spin lifetime can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](b ) .",
    "following the discussion in the last section , the overall spin lifetime is also very short .    during oxygen treatments both",
    "the healing of oxygen vacancies in the mgo@xmath10 layer and an additional oxidization of the co may occur .",
    "the effective thickness of the oxide barrier most likely increases faster at the sides than in the center of the electrodes , leading to the inhomogeneous oxide barrier thickness as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig10](b ) and [ fig : fig10](c ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](b )",
    "we first discuss the situation with the gate voltage tuned to the cnp of the bare graphene between the electrode , i.e. @xmath88 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) by the red dashed and green dash - dotted line .",
    "the thicker the oxide barrier becomes the more the doping of the graphene under the electrode approaches the one of the outer bare graphene parts . only in the middle region of the electrode , where the oxidization is less advanced , there remain strong _ n_-doping from the co. due to the pinhole the barrier resistance is smallest there and most of the applied current will now flow through this part ( see large white arrow in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig10](b ) ) . but as the oxide barrier at this point is slightly thicker than in the as - fabricated device and also because of small contributions of the current over the thicker parts of the oxide barrier , the spin lifetime becomes longer than in the initial device .",
    "the crucial difference to the as - fabricated condition is that now the oxide barrier is thick enough to eliminate fermi level pinning and to significantly reduce the _ n_-doping by the co. accordingly , it is now possible to tune the graphene carrier density to its cnp near the center pinhole .",
    "the corresponding doping profile is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](c ) ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) after the first oxygen treatment at @xmath89 ) .    now a key result from sec .",
    "[ oxygen_treatments]b gets important : the maximum resistance at both cnps is comparable although there is a significant difference in the area of the contact - covered and contact - free graphene parts as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) .",
    "this implies that the resistivity of the contact covered graphene must be very large near the contact - induced cnp .",
    "therefore , the combination of oxide barrier resistance and graphene resistance can now also favor currents over the thicker parts ( see large arrows in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig10](c ) ) of the oxide than over the thinner part in the middle of the electrode ( see small arrow in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig10](c ) ) .",
    "this notion is further supported as the graphene resistance under the thicker oxide is now smaller due to the larger gate - induced charge carrier density as illustrated in the doping profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](c ) . on the other hand , it is very unlikely that spins that are injected over these thicker parts of the oxide diffuse into a graphene region of the thinner oxide barrier mainly because of its small density of states at the cnp .",
    "but it will be exactly these leftover inner pinhole regions in which spin dephasing and scattering remains strongest .",
    "the reduced interaction of the injected spins with these spin hot spots may explain the strongly suppressed contact - induced spin scattering at this gate voltage which allows for nanosecond spin lifetimes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](b ) .",
    "in summary , we successfully manipulated the graphene - to - mgo / co interface in single and bilayer graphene spin - valve devices by successive oxygen treatments and achieved a gradual transition from small towards high contact resistance area products . with this",
    "the spin transport properties are enhanced significantly .",
    "we observe an increase in spin lifetimes and spin resistances by a factor of seven and achieve values of up to at room temperature .",
    "therefore the limiting factor of contact - induced spin dephasing is demonstrated without error - prone comparison between different devices .",
    "subsequent oxidization of the mgo spin injection barrier furthermore leads to the appearance of a contact - induced charge neutrality point in charge transport .",
    "we observe that this dirac peak is strongly linked to gate dependent spin transport as seen by the increase of the spin lifetime .",
    "we gave a possible explanation for this behavior considering both the co - to - graphene interaction and the spatially inhomogeneous spin and charge current paths through the mgo barrier .",
    "this explanation highlights one important aspect : both , the spin and charge transport must simultaneously be understood on a microscopic level in order to unveil relevant spin scattering mechanisms from macroscopic hanle measurements of the whole device .",
    "this was already partially addressed in a previous study that theoretically investigated the implications of different spin transport parameters of contact - covered and contact - free graphene regions on the extracted value of the spin lifetime by hanle measurements.@xcite but the real situation is by far more complicated .",
    "for example , there will be @xmath90 junctions formed between the differently doped contact - covered and contact - free graphene regions with large local electric fields which might also play an important role for spin transport .",
    "we especially demonstrated that not only differences between the contact covered and bare graphene regions are important to understand the overall charge and spin transport properties of a device but also subtle variations within the contact regions which result from inhomogeneous oxide barriers and pinholes .",
