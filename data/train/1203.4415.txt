    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are the living fossils of an epoch dating back to the time of milky way s formation and thus , they probably share the same physical conditions and processes that originated our galaxy . since formation , gcs are continuously affected by several sources of mass loss but , because of a large initial mass and/or an orbit that takes them most of the time away from the galactic centre and/or disk , they are , in general , characterised by a long longevity .",
    "this suggests that some primordial information may have been preserved , if not at the individual scale , at least with respect to the collective properties shared by the surviving gc population .    in this context , an interesting issue is the origin of the milky way s ( old ) gc population and its relation to the young massive clusters that form in starbursts and galaxy mergers of the local universe .",
    "if both old and young cluster populations share a similar , starburst origin , the mass distribution of their members should also be characterised by similar mass functions ( mfs ) , something that is ruled out by observations in several local galaxies .",
    "for instance , when expressed in terms of the number of gcs per unit logarithmic mass - interval ( @xmath5 ) , the mfs of young clusters in several galaxies follow monotonically a power law of slope @xmath6 , while the present - day gc mf ( pdmf ) presents a turnover for masses lower than @xmath7 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the low - mass drop in the lognormal pdmf has been interpreted as mainly due to the large - scale dissolution of low - mass gcs after several gyrs of tidal interactions with the galaxy and internal dynamical processes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    consequently , since mass loss",
    "continuously changes the mf shape - especially in the low - mass range , a direct comparison of the several gyr - old pdmf with the mf of young clusters should not be used to draw conclusions on a physical relation between both populations . on the other hand , this raises another , but related question of whether or not the initial mfs ( icmfs ) of globular and young clusters are similar , since theoretical evidence suggest that cluster formation leaves distinct imprints in the icmfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if both cluster populations have the same origin , this should be reflected in the respective icmfs .",
    "given the above , the reconstruction of milky way s gc icmf requires having access not only to the ( as complete as possible ) pdmf , but also to the mass - loss physics .",
    "as for the latter , recent numerical simulations and semi - analytical models have produced robust relations for the mass evolution of star clusters located in different environments and losing mass through stellar evolution and tidal interactions with galactic substructures and giant molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    over the years , the gcmf time evolution has been investigated with a wide variety of approaches .",
    "for instance , @xcite takes the effects of stellar evolution , two - body relaxation , disc shocking , dynamical friction , and the location in the galaxy into account to follow the evolution of individual gcs .",
    "the main findings are : the large - scale disruption of gcs in the central parts of the galaxy leads to a flattening in their spatial distribution ; if the initial gcmf shape is lognormal , it is preserved in most cases ; and in the case of an initial power - law gcmf , evolutionary processes tend to change it into lognormal .",
    "@xcite considers gc systems formed with a power - law mf and follows the orbits of individual clusters .",
    "taking several gc destruction mechanisms into account , he finds luminosity distributions that depend on galactocentric distance .",
    "@xcite study the dynamical evolution of m87 gcs with numerical simulations that cover a range of initial conditions for the gcmf and for the spatial and velocity distribution of the gcs .",
    "the simulations include the effects of two - body relaxation , dynamical friction , and stellar evolution - related mass loss .",
    "they confirm that an initial power - law gcmf can be changed into bell - shaped through dynamical processes , and show that the inner flattening observed in the spatial distribution of m87 gcs can result from the dynamical evolution on an initially steep density profile .",
    "@xcite show that an approximately gaussian mf is naturally generated from a power - law mass distribution ( but with a lower - mass limit ) of protoglobular clouds by expulsion from the protocluster of star - forming gas due to supernova activity .",
    "@xcite targets the mf and radial distribution evolution of the galactic gcs by means of a fokker - planck model that considers dynamical friction , disc / bulge shocking and eccentric gc orbits .",
    "their best - fit models predict the initial gc mass as @xmath8 .    at some point ,",
    "most of the previous works compare models with the _ observed _ gc pdmf .",
    "however , especially because of the large distances involved , a direct determination of the stellar mass for most gcs is not available , which means that the observational pdmf can not be taken as an ideal starting point for this analysis . instead , the most direct and robust observable available for the present - day milky way s gc population as a whole is the luminosity function ( lf ) , which is usually expressed in terms of the absolute @xmath9 magnitude",
    "obviously , the use of luminosity requires a mass - to - light relation ( mlr ) to convert lfs into mfs .",
    "recent observational and theoretical findings have convincingly shown that the mlr is not constant with respect to cluster mass .",
    "instead , the dynamical evolution of clusters - and the preferential loss of low - mass stars - also affects the mlr .",
    "specifically , for a given age and metallicity , the mlr is expected to increase with cluster mass ( or luminosity ; e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the mlr dependence on luminosity ( or mass ) is already suggested by the dynamical cluster mass and mlr estimates of @xcite .",
    "our goal with the present paper is to reconstruct both the icmf and pdmf of the galactic gcs , starting with their observed lf and taking the mass loss into account . in this process",
    ", different analytical forms of the mlr will be tested to search for constraints .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ gclf ] we build the observed and theoretical lfs of the galactic gcs , convert the latter into the pdmf , and discuss the adopted mlrs . in sect .",
    "[ asa ] we briefly describe the parameter - search method . in sect .",
    "[ results ] we discuss the results .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to build the observed ( or present - day ) lf ( @xmath10 , i.e. , number of gcs per unit absolute magnitude interval ) of the galactic gcs . the data were taken from the 2010 revision of the catalogue compiled by @xcite , which contains 156 gcs with _ bona - fide _ absolute magnitudes in the v band ( ) . by definition ,",
    "the integral of @xmath11 , over the full @xmath12 range is the input number of gcs . as a caveat ,",
    "we note that several works indicate that not all galactic gcs share a common history ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , with some having been accreted from dwarf galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and others associated with the galactic thick disc ( e.g. @xcite ) .    following previous work ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", uncertainties in  are incorporated in the lf by assuming a normal ( gaussian ) distribution of errors . specifically , if the magnitude and standard deviation of a gc ( usually , the mean value over a series of independent measurements ) are given by @xmath13 , the probability of finding it at a specific value @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 .",
    "next , we build a grid of bins covering the full  range in @xcite and , for each bin , we sum the  density ( or probability ) for all gcs ( i.e. , the difference of the error function computed at the bin borders )",
    ". however , since uncertainties are not given in @xcite , for simplicity we adopt relative errors that depend on the apparent magnitude ( @xmath16 ) as @xmath17 .",
    "thus , relatively bright ( @xmath18 ) gcs have @xmath19 , while fainter ones ( @xmath20 ) have @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we assume that the absolute error in @xmath12 is simply given by @xmath22 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the end result is a distribution function significantly smoother than a classical histogram .",
    "indeed , the observed lf ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is approximately gaussian - shaped with a pronounced peak around @xmath23 and @xmath24mags of full width at half maximum .",
    "as usual with respect to distribution functions , the observed @xmath11 can be linked to the pdmf , @xmath25 , by    @xmath26    however , except for a few cases , the stellar mass of most gcs has not been directly measured , and so , the actual shape of @xmath27 remains uncertain .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath27 can be inferred if one knows the initial mf , the gcs age , and the mass - loss physics . formally , if @xmath28 is the mf at 0 - and assuming that gcs are not formed subsequently , the mf at a later time @xmath29 is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 represents the individual gc masses at 0 .",
    "several works ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that star clusters form with a mass distribution that follows the truncated power - law of @xcite    @xmath33    over the mass range @xmath34 ",
    "@xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 is the exponential truncation mass , and  is a normalisation constant .",
    "we note that , because of the continuous mass loss ( see below ) , gcs that formed with a relatively low mass may no longer be detected , and can be considered as dissolved . here",
    ", we represent this dissolution limit by the lower _ observable _ mass value @xmath37 .",
    "the earliest cluster phase is dominated by effects related to the impulsive removal of the parental , intra - cluster gas by supernovae and massive - star winds , which rapidly damps cluster formation and changes the ratio between residual gravitational potential and stellar velocity dispersion , thus leading to the first bout of dynamical evolution ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another consequence of these early effects on the icmf may be a depletion in the number of gcs towards the low - mass range ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "clusters can be considered to be essentially gas free after the first @xmath38yrs , but they keep losing mass mainly through stellar evolution and externally - driven tidal effects . after several gyrs , these processes may reduce the mass to a fraction of the initial value . following @xcite , we express the mass remaining ( due to stellar evolution and tidal effects ) in a given gc ( with initial mass @xmath32 ) at time @xmath29 by    @xmath39^{1/\\gamma } , \\label{masst}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the stellar evolution mass loss , @xmath1 is the dissolution timescale of a @xmath0 star cluster , and @xmath41 is the power - law exponent that sets the dependence of the cluster disruption time on mass .",
    "we note that @xmath40 is a function of time , but since we are dealing with gcs with ages between 9 - 13gyr , we simplify this point by taking here the asymptotic value @xmath42 ( @xcite ) .",
    "useful milky way approximations for the other parameters are @xmath43 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath44myr ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , @xmath1 is expected to present a significant dispersion around its quoted value to account for different gc environments and orbital conditions ( @xcite ) . in this sense",
    ", we consider @xmath1 to be a free parameter allowed to vary within a given range ( sect .",
    "[ asa ] ) .",
    "thus , inverting eq .",
    "[ masst ] to have @xmath45 and coupling eqs .",
    "[ eqpartial ] and [ schechter ] , the pdmf can be expressed as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 .",
    "formally , eq .  [ pmdf ] applies to an individual cluster having evolved over a time @xmath29 after 0 .",
    "however , the underlying idea of our approach is to consider not the individual , but the collective - or average - evolution of the full sample of the galactic gcs until now .",
    "this adds another component to our approach because , instead of a single formation event , the milky way gcs present some dispersion in age ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this sense , @xmath29 should be taken as the mean - or at least , the representative - age ( ) of the gc population .",
    "so , hereafter we consider @xmath48 .",
    "the constant  can be computed by noting that the integral of eq .",
    "[ pmdf ] over the minimum observable gc mass , @xmath37 , and the maximum remaining mass at time @xmath49 , @xmath50 , corresponds to the present - day number of gcs ( @xmath51 )    @xmath52    changing variables in the integral , eq .

    "[ pdlf ] should be expressed as a function of @xmath12 ( through @xmath58 ) , which can be done by means of a mass - to - light relation ( @xmath62 ) .      according to sect .",
    "[ intro ] and eq .",
    "[ pdlf ] , it is clear that the dependence of mlr on luminosity ( or mass ) is central to the task of building mfs from the observed lf . in this sense",
    ", we consider here the following comprehensive range of mlr shapes , _",
    "( i ) _ constant : @xmath63 ; _ ( ii ) _ linearly - increasing with luminosity : @xmath64 ; _ ( iii ) _ power - law : @xmath65 ; and _ ( iv ) _ logarithmic : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constants . note that for practical reasons ( i.e. , the need of an analytical expression to convert @xmath12 into @xmath69 in eq .  [ pdlf ] ) , we express the mlr as a function of @xmath58 and not mass .",
    "obviously , once the mlr constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 have been assigned values , the minimum and maximum present - day gc masses ( @xmath37 and @xmath70 ) are naturally determined from the respective faint and bright boundaries of the observed lf .",
    "and , for a given mean gc age ( ) , a similar reasoning leads to the maximum gc mass ( @xmath71 ) at 0  through inversion of eq .",
    "[ masst ] .",
    "the approach summarised by eq .",
    "[ pdlf ] contains some poorly - known ( and unknown ) parameters , such as the mean cluster age ( @xmath49 ) , the dissolution timescale ( @xmath72 ) , the truncation mass ( @xmath36 ) , and the mlr constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "our approach considers these five parameters as free .",
    "however , we note that some dependence among these parameters should be expected to occur , especially for very wide search ranges . for instance , a short  would result in a low @xmath1 to hasten dissolution over a shorter age range .",
    "similarly , a lower mlr would shift the mf turnover to a lower cluster mass , which could result from a longer dissolution timescale ( i.e. less dynamical evolution ) for a given mean cluster age .",
    "we minimise this effect by adopting a reasonable gc age range ( see below ) .",
    "thus , the task now is to search for values for the set of free parameters @xmath73 that produces the best match between the observed and theoretical lfs , @xmath11 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "this is achieved by minimising the root mean squared residual ( 2 ) between both functions . by construction ,",
    "2  is a function of the free parameters , i.e. , @xmath75 , which we express as    @xmath76 ^ 2 } { \\tilde\\phi(m^j_v)+\\phi(m^j_v)}},\\ ] ]    where the sum occurs over the @xmath77 non - zero magnitude bins of the observed lf .",

    "finally , the squared sum is divided by the total number of observed gcs , which makes 2  dimensionless and preserves the number statistics when comparing lfs built with unequal gc populations .",

    "when converted to a function of gc mass , the power - law mlr follows the relation @xmath231^{0.42\\pm0.01}.\\ ] ]    in summary , the best results in terms of minimum 2  residuals and realistic gc parameters are obtained with mlrs that are relatively low for most of the gc mass range , but increase with luminosity ( or mass ) , in the present case , expressed as a power - law ( exponent 0.67 ) or linearly .",
    "one of the main results of our approach is to provide access to the pdmf through eq .",
    "[ pmdf ] and the best - fit parameters of each mlr mode . for practical reasons ,",
    "they are shown in terms of @xmath232 in fig .",
    "they all clearly resemble a lognormal mass distribution ] , which is confirmed by the corresponding fit - the parameters are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "again , the lognormal character applies especially to the mfs produced by the power - law and linear mlrs , followed by the logarithmic and constant modes .",
    ".lognormal parameters of the present - day mf [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table notes .",

    "( 3 ) : dispersion in @xmath233 ; col .",
    "( 4 ) : correlation coefficient of the lognormal fit to the pdmfs ; col .  ( 5 ) : average gc mass ; col .  ( 6 ) : ratio between the mean and turnover mass .",
    "overall , the pdmf mass turnover predicted by our mlrs occur within @xmath234  ( the upper bound corresponding to the power - law mlr ) , a range somewhat lower than the @xmath235  derived in previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "probably , the difference occurs because for most of the gc mass range , our mlr models are lower than the @xmath236 usually employed in previous studies , which naturally shifts  to lower values , implying longer dissolution timescales .",
    "in addition , by not including the effects of shocks with giant molecular clouds and spiral arms , and two - body evaporation and ejection , eq .  [ masst ] probably yields a softer mass - loss rate than those previously used .",
    "we also note that , for masses larger than that of the turnover , the pdmfs ( of the power - law and linear mlrs ) have a slope similar ( within the uncertainties ) to the mfs of young clusters and molecular clouds observed in the milky way and other galaxies ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a similar high - mass slope was found for a sample of galactic and m31 gcs by @xcite . actually , this is a natural consequence of the large @xmath36 , which favours the formation of a higher number of massive clusters with respect to a low-@xmath36 icmf .",
    "massive clusters are naturally long - lived and , thus , the slope of the large - mass tail of the icmf tends to be preserved for longer periods of time .",
    "we note that our best - fit mlr model predicts a maximum pdmf mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) that is compatible with current estimates for _ omega cen _ ( ngc5139 ) : @xmath237 ( @xcite ) , @xmath238 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath239 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the latter estimate implies the ratio @xmath240 , again consistent with the power - law mlr value for a gc with mass in the range @xmath241 ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the power - law mlr predicts the mean present - day gc mass @xmath242 , from which follows the scaling relation @xmath243 .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the icmfs reconstructed with the best - fit parameters .",
    "interestingly , while the icmfs predicted by the constant and logarithmic mlrs show the typical break at @xmath244 of the schechter profile , those of the linear and power - law mlrs do not .",
    "both are characterised by the large value of @xmath210 and , thus , they end up resembling simply as a scale - free , power - law of slope @xmath245 ( or @xmath246 , when expressed as @xmath247 ) over the very wide mass range @xmath248@xmath249 .",
    "the latter is a typical feature of young cluster mfs observed in nearby galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we present an approach to recover both the initial and present - day mass functions of the galactic globular clusters , having as constraint the observed luminosity distribution .",
    "this is achieved by taking a few mass - loss processes into account and assuming a mass - to - light ratio that is either constant or increases with luminosity linearly , as a power law or logarithmically .",
    "it starts with a schechter - like icmf , where the truncation ( @xmath36 ) mass is a free parameter .",
    "then , using a set of parameters that usually apply to the dynamical dissolution of galactic star clusters , among these the mean gc age ( ) , the dissolution timescale of a @xmath250   cluster ( @xmath1 ) , and an mlr ( parametrised by the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , we compute the mf shape after evolving for a time  after the onset of the gas - free phase . the evolved mf is subsequently converted into the lf .",
    "finally , we search for the optimum parameters @xmath251 that minimise the residuals ( 2 ) between the evolved and observed lfs .",
    "the best results , both in terms of minimum values of 2  and realistic parameters for the galactic gcs , correspond to the power - law and linear mlrs , respectively .",
    "specifically , because both mlrs increase with luminosity ( or mass ) , their present - day mfs imply a total mass in gcs of the order of @xmath252 , which corresponds to a fraction of @xmath3 of the initial stellar mass in gcs . on the other hand , the constant and logarithmic mlrs are exceedingly shallow for the full gc mass range , yielding unrealistically low values of @xmath85 .    because of the large truncation mass ( @xmath253 ) , the schechter - like icmfs ( of the linear and power - law mlrs ) end up resembling the scale - free , power - law mfs of young clusters and molecular clouds in the milky way and other galaxies . in addition , their pdmfs follow closely a lognormal distribution with a turnover mass at @xmath4  that , for larger masses , behave as a power - law with the same slope as the icmfs . the low values of , compared to previous works , follow from the relatively low mlrs ( for most of the gc mass range ) dealt with here .",
    "summarising , it is clear that the power - law is not the unique icmf solution , the mlr , which serves to fine - tune the details , must increase with cluster mass ( or luminosity ) , and that mass loss is the main factor responsible for shaping the icmf into its present , lognormal form .",
    "finally , our results suggest a common origin - in terms of physical processes - for gcs and young clusters .",
