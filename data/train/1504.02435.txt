    "complex systems with interacting constituents are ubiquitous in nature and society . to understand the microscopic mechanisms of emerging statistical laws of complex systems , one records and analyzes time series of observable quantities .",
    "these time series are usually nonstationary and possess long - range power - law cross - correlations .",

    "the earliest was joint multifractal analysis to study the cross - multifractal nature of two joint multifractal measures through the scaling behaviors of the joint moments @xcite , which is a multifractal cross - correlation analysis based on the partition function approach ( mf - x - pf ) @xcite . over the past decade , detrended cross - correlation analysis ( dcca ) has become the most popular method of investigating the long - range power - law cross correlations between two nonstationary time series @xcite , and this method has numerous variants @xcite .",
    "statistical tests can be used to measure these cross correlations @xcite .",
    "there is also a group of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mf - dcca ) methods of analyzing multifractal time series , e.g. , mf - x - dfa @xcite , mf - x - dma @xcite , and mf - hxa @xcite .",
    "the observed long - range power - law cross - correlations between two time series may not be caused by their intrinsic relationship but by a common third driving force or by common external factors @xcite .",
    "if the influence of the common external factors on the two time series are additive , we can use partial correlation to measure their intrinsic relationship @xcite . to extract the intrinsic long - range power - law cross - correlations between two time series affected by common driving driving forces , we previously developed and used detrended partial cross - correlation analysis ( dpxa ) and studied the dpxa exponents of variable cases , combining the ideas of detrended cross - correlation analysis and partial correlation @xcite . in ref .",
