    "@xcite initiated the research on this topic by investigating _ simultaneous geometric embeddings _",

    "furthermore , the problem of deciding whether two graphs admit an sge is np - hard  @xcite .    two relaxations of sge have been considered in the literature in which edges are not forced to be straight - line segments . in the first setting , we look for a simultaneous embedding of two given planar graphs @xmath0 and @xmath1 in which every edge is drawn as a polygonal curve with few bends .",
    "erten and kobourov  @xcite proved that three bends per edge always suffice , a bound which has been improved to two bends per edge by di giacomo and liotta  @xcite . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are trees , then one bend per edge is sufficient  @xcite . note that black edges may be represented by different curves in each drawing .",
    "the variant in which the edges of @xmath0 and @xmath1 might only cross at right angles has also been considered  @xcite . in the second",
    "setting , we look for a _ simultaneous embedding with fixed edges _ ( or sefe ) of @xmath0 and @xmath1 : a simultaneous embedding in which every common edge is represented by the same simple curve in the plane ( see  [ fig : se - sefe - sge - example - sefe ] ) . in other words , a sefe is a drawing @xmath6 of the _ union graph _",

    "in particular , vertices and edges of @xmath178 have a unique representation in @xmath169 , hence it suffices to prove that the drawings of @xmath175 and @xmath179 in @xmath169 are planar ; we will argue about the planarity of the drawing of @xmath175 , as the one of @xmath179 can be proved analogously .    by lemma  [ lem : planar - planar - se ] , the drawing of @xmath180 in @xmath171 is plane . by lemma  [ le : planar - tree - convex - position ] , @xmath171 stays plane after all the components different from @xmath159 have been expanded . by lemma  [ lem : drawing - s - star ] ,",
    "the drawing @xmath116 of @xmath159 is plane , as well .",
