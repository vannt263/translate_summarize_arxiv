    "in this paper we study the unique invariant measure of the stochastically perturbed allen - cahn equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a one - dimensional order parameter defined for all non - negative times @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is a formal expression denoting space - time white noise and @xmath9 is a symmetric double - well potential .",
    "the canonical choice for @xmath9 is @xmath10 although more general choices are possible ( see assumption  [ ass : v ] below ) .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the invariant measure for large system sizes , @xmath11    it is well - known that for @xmath12 and fixed system size @xmath13 , the invariant measure of the allen - cahn equation concentrates on minimizers of the energy @xmath14 this follows from large deviation theory .",
    "in fact , even for system sizes @xmath15 that grow with @xmath16 , the same is true .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the second author proved this fact for @xmath17 for any @xmath18 .",
    "our main goal in the current paper is to go up to interval sizes that are _ exponential _ with respect to @xmath19 and , specifically , to understand the _ competition between energy and entropy _ that emerges in this regime .",
    "let us first consider the effect of on the measure .",
    "the intuition is that the invariant measure can be viewed as a gibbs measure with the given energy , i.e. , that it is in some heuristic sense proportional to @xmath20 the heuristic picture then says that , because of the potential term in the energy , functions @xmath21 supported on this measure are most likely to be close to one or the other minimum of @xmath9 on most of @xmath22 $ ] . on the other hand , because of the gradient term in the energy , there is an energetic `` cost '' @xmath23 for each transition between these two preferred states , making such transitions unlikely . when the system size is order - one , this is the end of the story .",
    "now let us consider the competing effect of on the measure when the system size is large .",
    "namely , the probability of finding a transition between the minima of @xmath9 is increased by the fact that it is possible for the transition to occur anyplace in the system .",
    "hence , the folklore is that the probability of finding @xmath24 transition layers scales like @xmath25 this competition between entropy and energy is captured ( on the exponential level ) in our first theorem , theorem  [ t : layers ] below .",
    "our second result , theorem  [ t : uniform ] , then shows the uniform distribution of transitions within the domain .",
    "as far as our methods , the central idea is that one can decompose the measure into conditional measures and the corresponding marginals in order to reduce to order - one intervals on which one can apply large deviation theory . along the way , it is important for us to use measure - preserving _ reflection arguments _ that allow us to transform the underlying brownian paths . the detailed structure of the ( deterministic ) energy functional is also critical in our proofs .",
    "we will state our results in detail in subsection  [ ss : mr ] after first explaining our set - up and notation .",
    "for the potential @xmath9 in  , we need a symmetric double - well potential with at least superlinear growth at infinity . for simplicity , we assume that the two minima of @xmath9 are normalized to be at @xmath2 and that the minimum value of the potential is zero .",
    "to be precise , our assumptions are :    [ ass : v ] @xmath9 is a smooth , even potential such that , on @xmath26 , @xmath9 satisfies @xmath27    if we assume superquadratic growth on @xmath9 at infinity ( recall that we have _ quartic _ growth of the standard double well potential @xmath28 ) , some of our technical lemmas simplify slightly . in particular",
    ", one can remove the dependence of the minimal system size @xmath29 on @xmath30 in lemmas  [ le : lazy ] and [ l : cl ] .",
    "because of the normalization of our potential , the transitions that we are interested in are transitions between @xmath2 .",
    "we make the notion precise in the following definition .",
    "[ def : layer ] we say that @xmath21 has an up transition layer on @xmath31 if @xmath32 we say that @xmath21 has a down transition layer on @xmath31 if the same condition holds with signs reversed , and that @xmath21 has a transition layer if it has an up or down transition layer .    for the boundary conditions on our pde",
    ", we will work with the popular inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath33 because of the boundary conditions , there is necessarily _",
    "one _ up transition layer , and the question is whether there are additional transition layers .",
    "moreover , if there are additional layers , they come as a pair of an up layer and a down layer . note that our methods can also handle other boundary conditions , for instance periodic boundary conditions or dirichlet boundary conditions that do not force a transition layer to be present .",
    "we will denote the invariant measure of   subject to the boundary conditions   by @xmath34 and the corresponding expectation by @xmath35 .",
    "we will often use the fact that the measure @xmath36 can be written as a gaussian measure with density @xcite .",
    "namely , one can express the expectation of any test function @xmath37 as @xmath38}{\\mathbb{e}^{\\mathcal{w}_{\\varepsilon},-1,1 } _ { ( -{l_{\\varepsilon}},{l_{\\varepsilon}})}\\left[\\exp\\big(-\\frac{1}{{\\varepsilon}}\\int_{-{l_{\\varepsilon}}}^{{l_{\\varepsilon } } } v(u)\\,dx\\big)\\right]}. \\label{m30.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 denotes the expectation with respect to the measure @xmath40 , which is the distribution of a brownian bridge on @xmath41 from @xmath0 to @xmath3 with variance proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "properties of @xmath42 will be discussed in detail in section [ s : prlm ] .",
    "the deterministic allen - cahn equation ( set @xmath43 in  ) is the @xmath44-gradient flow of the energy @xmath45 when we need to refer to the energy on all of @xmath46 or the localized energy on a subinterval , we will denote this with a subscript : @xmath47 as mentioned above , the energy functional will be important for understanding the invariant measure of the stochastic equation .",
    "in particular , the probability of finding transition layers will depend on the energetic `` cost '' of a transition layer on @xmath46 , that is : @xmath48 it is well known @xcite that this cost can be computed explicitly as @xmath49 see the beginning of section  [ s : detac ] for an explanation .",
    "we will often refer to scaling regimes in our results . to this end , we define the following notation .    [",
    "n : notation ] the well - established theory of large deviations applies on intervals whose length is order - one with respect to @xmath16 . a main point of this paper , however , is to obtain estimates on intervals that are exponentially large with respect to @xmath16 and for which , consequently , the established theory does not apply .",
    "we therefore use a subscript of @xmath16 in order to distinguish interval lengths that are large with respect to @xmath16 from quantities that are order - one with respect to @xmath16 .    to specify bounds with respect to @xmath16 , we sometimes make use of the shorthand notation @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . to explain : we write @xmath53 if for every @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 for @xmath16 sufficiently small .",
    "we write @xmath56 if there exists a universal constant @xmath57 such that @xmath58 , and similarly for @xmath59 . if both inequalities hold , then we write @xmath60",
    ".    we write @xmath61 if for every @xmath62 we have @xmath63 for @xmath16 sufficiently small , and similarly for @xmath64 .",
    "if both inequalities hold , then we write @xmath65 .",
    "we use numbered constants @xmath66 , @xmath67 , et cetera , to denote specific constants that we refer to later in the paper . on the other hand",
    ", we use @xmath68 to denote a generic order - one constant whose value may change from place to place . throughout the article , @xmath68 or",
    "a numbered constant @xmath69 is a constant that is universal except for a possible dependence on the potential @xmath9 .    we are now ready to state our results .",
    "recall that the boundary conditions imply that there must be at least one up layer and that any additional layers come in pairs .",
    "we will always consider the regime where the system size @xmath15 satisfies @xmath70 ( recall that @xmath23 is the energy cost defined in  . )",
    "this is the regime in which one expects the probability of extra transitions to go to zero and in particular to obey the energetic and entropic scaling expressed in  .",
    "our first result captures this behavior on the exponential level .",
    "[ t : layers ] suppose that @xmath15 satisfies  .",
    "then for every @xmath71 and @xmath72 sufficiently small , there exists @xmath73 such that for @xmath74 , one has the upper bound @xmath75 and the lower bound @xmath76    one should note that because of the error term @xmath77 , our result sees only information on the exponential level .",
    "in particular , if one has an exponential system size such that @xmath78 then what our result says is that for any @xmath71 we have @xmath79    throughout the paper , when we say `` @xmath21 has @xmath80 layers , '' we mean that @xmath21 has @xmath80 layers .    as mentioned above",
    ", our techniques can also handle different boundary conditions , e.g. , periodic boundary conditions or dirichlet boundary conditions that do not enforce a transition layer .",
    "for instance , for periodic boundary conditions or dirichlet conditions @xmath81 , the probability of @xmath82 transition layers is bounded above and below by @xmath83 respectively , while for homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions , the probability of @xmath24 transition layers is bounded above and below by @xmath84 respectively .    our second main result states that , on scales larger than logarithmic in @xmath85 , the layer location is uniformly distributed in the following sense .",
    "[ t : uniform ] consider @xmath34 in the regime @xmath86 let @xmath87 be such that @xmath88 then uniformly for any @xmath89 such that @xmath90 \\subseteq [ -{l_{\\varepsilon}},{l_{\\varepsilon}}]$ ] , we have @xmath91 \\big ) \\approx 1.\\label{unif}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the theorem says that the probability of finding an up transition layer in a subinterval of length @xmath92 given a system size @xmath93 is approximately @xmath94 in the sense expressed in  , independent of the location of the subinterval .",
    "( the existence of an up transition layer somewhere in the system is forced by the boundary conditions . ) in this sense , the layer locations are approximately uniformly distributed .",
    "the theorem is strongest when considering @xmath95 at the lower range of validity : it shows that the uniform distribution holds not only on macroscopic intervals but also down to the logarithmic scale .",
    "we remark that the uniform distribution of the layer location in our regime is very different from the characterization of the layer distribution in the case @xmath96 studied in  @xcite ; see subsection  [ ss : back ] below for more discussion .",
    "our approach for theorem  [ t : layers ] relies on a simple idea .",
    "namely , while we can not use large deviation theory directly on @xmath97 , we can use the markovianity of the underlying reference measure to reduce to order - one subintervals on which we can .",
    "in particular , by taking large ( but order - one ) subintervals and conditioning on the boundary values of a larger , surrounding subinterval , we can take advantage of _ large deviation bounds _ with a cost that is _ to leading order independent of the subinterval size_. this method is similar in spirit to freidlin and wentzell s approach of calculating the expected exit time from a metastable domain for a diffusion process with small noise ( @xcite , see subsection [ ss : back ] for a more detailed account of the related literature ) .    to illustrate the idea ,",
    "suppose that we want to estimate the probability that there is a transition layer contained within @xmath98 $ ] for some @xmath99 large .",
    "( transition layers are introduced in definition  [ def : layer ] above ; roughly , they are layers connecting @xmath2 . )",
    "the markov property ( lemma  [ le : markov1b ] ) implies that this probability can be written as @xmath100 here @xmath101 denotes the marginal distribution of the pair @xmath102 , and @xmath103 denotes the distribution of paths on @xmath104 with boundary conditions @xmath105 ( see section [ s : prlm ] for a precise definition of this measure ) .    in subsection [ ss : ld ]",
    "we establish large deviation estimates for the measures @xmath106 that hold locally uniformly in the boundary values @xmath107 .",

    "( see subsection [ ss : ld ] for a more complete discussion . )",
    "now we arrive at the second problem , which is more subtle .",
    "the issue is that the energy difference @xmath114 depends strongly on the boundary conditions .",
    "the cost that we are expecting to recover is @xmath23 , defined in  .",
    "however , if @xmath115 and @xmath116 , for instance , then the energy _ difference _ is approximately zero ! in this case , the information about the probability of a transition is encoded in the distribution @xmath101 .",

    "the dynamic behavior observed in both of these articles is consistent with our results on the invariant measure .",
    "in particular , the brownian motion of interfaces is consistent with the uniform distribution of layer location that we observe in theorem [ t : uniform ] .",

    "furthermore , the authors characterize the asymptotic distribution of the position of the interfacial layer .",
    "it is nonuniform due to the energetic repulsion from the boundary of the interval . to see this nonuniformity ,",
    "the moderate scaling @xmath138 is necessary .",
    "incidentally , this shows that our lower bound @xmath139 in theorem  [ t : uniform ] is optimal : below the scale of @xmath140 , nonuniformity occurs . loosely speaking , the results in @xcite and ours are complimentary .",
    "they obtain finer results on logarithmically large system sizes , we obtain coarser results on exponentially large system sizes .    results similar to ( but different from ) ours were obtained in @xcite for a one - dimensional ising model with ferromagnetic kac potential .",
    "this is a spin model whose spins interact not only with their nearest neighbors , but with all spins in a given range .",
    "the authors study the limit in which this range diverges .",
    "this corresponds to the limit @xmath12 that we investigate .",
    "their main argument relies on a large deviation statement for the whole system in a _ local topology_. this large deviation result implies , for example , that the the local spin averages concentrate around @xmath2 and that probability to see a transition from @xmath0 to @xmath3 in any given compact interval is exponentially small .",
    "the exponential rate is given by the energetic cost of a transition ( similar to the constant @xmath23 in this work ) .",
    "the significant difference between their large deviation bounds and ours is the dependence on the boundary condition .",
    "their bounds state that the exponential decay of the probability of observing a certain behavior on an order - one interval is governed by the energy .",
    "we only get bounds for the measures conditioned on the boundary values on that interval .",
    "the difference is easy to appreciate on the level of the results .",
    "as mentioned , the probability of seeing a transition on a given order - one subinterval in their setting is exponentially small , while  because of our boundary conditions  a similar statement can not possibly hold in our case : indeed , if it were to hold , we could sum over order - one subintervals and deduce that the probability to see a transition in the full system goes to zero with the noise , while in fact it is identically equal to one .",
    "finally , let us touch on the appearance of measures similar to @xmath34 in the study of schrdinger operators .",
    "the feynman - kac formula gives a way to solve the imaginary time schrdinger equation ( i.e. , the heat equation with a potential ) in terms of measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to wiener measure . in this context ,",
    "our model is often referred to as the @xmath141 model and the limit @xmath12 corresponds to the _ semiclassical limit _ in which the planck constant @xmath142 is sent to zero .",
    "lemma [ le : onept ] , for instance , is closely related ( but not equivalent to ) a statement about the decay of the ground state for the schrdinger operator @xmath143 as @xmath12 .",
    "we begin with preliminaries : in section  2 we collect some properties of the energy functional , and in section  3 we collect some probabilistic properties of @xmath144 and of the underlying gaussian measures . with these preliminaries in hand , we turn in section  4 to the proof of our first result , theorem  [ t : layers ] . in section  5",
    "we prove theorem  [ t : uniform ] , the uniform distribution of the layer location .",

    "in this section we discuss some more details about the energy functional @xmath145 ( cf .  ) .",
    "our goal is to familiarize the reader with the common intuition about this energy , as well as to present some facts that will guide our method and appear later in proofs .",
    "as described above , the potential term in the energy favors the states @xmath2 and the gradient term in the energy leads to an energetic cost for transitions between these states .",
    "given our large system and the boundary conditions  , it is natural to consider the problem @xmath146 as we mentioned , the minimum cost @xmath23 can be calculated explicitly ( cf .  ) .",
    "the calculations underlying this fact appear repeatedly in the proofs of our energy lemmas , so we begin by recalling them . the so - called modica - mortola trick ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) uses the elementary inequality @xmath147 to observe : @xmath148 which gives a lower bound on the energetic cost . for the matching upper",
    "bound , one observes that the equality @xmath149 holds if and only if @xmath150 , so that the minimum energetic cost is achieved precisely when @xmath151 we denote by @xmath152 the minimizer that is normalized so that @xmath153 .",
    "this function @xmath152 is then the unique , centered , stationary solution of the allen - cahn equation on @xmath46 subject to the given boundary conditions , i.e. , the solution of @xmath154 in the case of the standard double - well potential @xmath155 , one has @xmath156 .    for general potentials satisfying assumption  [ ass : v ] ,",

    "<S> we study the invariant measure of the one - dimensional stochastic allen - cahn equation for a small noise strength and a large but finite system . </S>",
    "<S> we endow the system with inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions that enforce at least one transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( our methods can be applied to other boundary conditions as well . ) </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the competition between the `` energy '' that should be minimized due to the small noise strength and the `` entropy '' that is induced by the large system size .    </S>",
    "<S> our methods handle system sizes that are exponential with respect to the inverse noise strength , up to the `` critical '' exponential size predicted by the heuristics . </S>",
    "<S> we capture the competition between energy and entropy through upper and lower bounds on the probability of extra transitions between @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds are sharp on the exponential scale and imply in particular that the probability of having one and only one transition from @xmath0 to @xmath3 is exponentially close to one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the position of the transition layer is uniformly distributed over the system on scales larger than the logarithm of the inverse noise strength .    our arguments rely on local large deviation bounds , the strong markov property , the symmetry of the potential , and measure - preserving reflections . </S>"
