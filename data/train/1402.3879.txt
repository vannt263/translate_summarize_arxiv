    "here is a detailed list of topics discussed in this work .",
    "* we first improve a local well - posedness theory for previously obtained in @xcite . in comparison with the results in @xcite",
    "we expand the range of @xmath42 . in the two dimensional case ,",
    "for example , our local theory works for all @xmath58 , in contrast with the old result @xmath59 given in remark 7.4 of @xcite . besides the expanded range of the exponent @xmath42",

    "* the morawetz - type inequalities , which give global space - time integral estimates , are powerful tools to understand the global behavior of solutions in the defocusing case .",

    "the advantage of the hyperbolic spaces when looking for a morawetz - type inequality in @xmath26 has been illustrated by the second author in @xcite with ionescu , where a similar morawetz - type inequality for solutions of a semi - linear schrdinger equation in the hyperbolic spaces has been proved .",
    "* as the first application of our morawetz inequality , we show global existence in time and scattering of solutions with finite energy for the defocusing problem when @xmath65 , see propositions [ scattering01 ] , [ scatteringn2pgeq5 ] and [ scattering3n6 ] .",
    "as far as the authors know , the scattering of a semi - linear equation under the same assumption is still unknown in the euclidean spaces @xmath10 , although scattering results have been proved under various additional assumptions in a lot of papers such as @xcite ( dimension 3 ) and @xcite ( all dimensions ) .",
    "+ a solution in the focusing case , however , may blow up in finite time .",

    "the second application is a scattering result on the following defocusing quintic wave equation in @xmath7 @xmath66 we show in the main theorem [ main1 ] that the solution scatters if the initial data is radial and satisfies the conditions @xmath67 one of the key ingredients of the proof is a transformation between solutions of and those of @xmath68 which has been employed by tataru in @xcite .",
    "this enables us to take advantage of the morawetz - type inequality on the hyperbolic plane obtained in the first part of this paper , see theorem [ morawetz2 ] , which is not available in the euclidian space @xmath7 .",

    "more precisely , a pair @xmath94 satisfies the finite integral condition above only if @xmath95 . on the other hand ,",
    "our assumption is @xmath96 , which is also the minimal requirement to guarantee @xmath97 .",
    "this is in fact relevant since @xmath98 is the critical sobolev space for , although @xmath99 is sufficient to guarantee that the energy is finite .",
    "* tsutaya @xcite also proves scattering results under similar point - wise assumptions on derivatives of the initial data as we did in ( [ condition1 ] ) , and in his work the radial condition is not assumed",
    ". however , his work only applies to small data .",
    "the reason is that although the fixed - point argument used there applies to more general non - linear terms , it is usually insufficient to deal with global in time solutions generated by large data .",
