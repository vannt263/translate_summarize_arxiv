    "presently we possess a wealth of observations regarding the high redshift universe , thanks to present day technology .",
    "the galaxies are regularly being detected till redshift @xmath2 using lyman break technique ( steidel et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "the uv luminosity functions of lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) are well constrained upto redshift @xmath3 using hubble ultra deep field observations ( bouwens et al . , 2007 ; bouwens et al . 2008 ; reddy & steidel , 2009 ; oesch et al . , 2010 ; bouwens et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "the faint end slope of the uv luminosity functions is well established for @xmath4 and it shows flattening of the luminosity function at low luminosity end .",
    "the presence of gunn - peterson ( gunn & peterson , 1965 ) absorption in the spectrum of high redshift quasars tells us a transition from highly ionised inter galactic medium ( igm ) to partially ionised igm around redshift @xmath5 ( wyithe , loeb & carilli , 2005 ; fan et al . , 2006 ; mortlock et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "also the electron scattering optical depth ( @xmath6 ) measured in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) constrains the reionization redshift to be @xmath7 ( komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ) for a step reionization scenario .",
    "further , the high resolution absorption spectra of quasars show the presence of metals in very low density igm far away from galaxies .",
    "metals are produced inside galaxies and believed to be transported by outflows produced by the supernova ( sne ) explosions in the galaxy .",
    "the outflows are routinely being observed in low redshift galaxies as well as in high redshift galaxies ( martin , 1999 ; pettini et al . , 2001 ; martin , 2005 ) .",
    "these outflows are likely to expel metals along with a large amount of inter stellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this , in turn , reduces the star formation in galaxies by reducing the available gas to form new generation of stars .",
    "thus the supernovae give a negative feedback to the star formation by throwing out gas from galaxies in the form of galactic winds .",
    "not only that , outflows also regulate the amount of metals in galaxies .",
    "starting from very early days , a tight correlation has been observed between luminosity and metallicity of galaxies ( lequeux et al .",
    "later , a more fundamental correlation has been found between the stellar mass and gas phase metallicity of galaxies in the local universe ( garnett , 2002 ; tremonti et al . , 2004 ;",
    "lee et al . , 2006 ; kewley & ellison , 2008 ) as well as in high redshift galaxies ( savaglio et al . , 2005 ; erb et al .",
    ", 2006 ; mannucci et al . , 2009 ; mannucci et al . ,",
    "it has been observed that galaxies with higher stellar mass trend to have more metals compared to their lower stellar mass counter parts .",
    "further observations of local as well as high redshift universe show that the luminosity - metallicity or mass metallicity relation observed in galaxies is due to a more general relationship between stellar mass , metallicity of the gas and star formation rate ( mannucci et al .",
    "2010 ; cullen et al .",
    "2013 ) . since",
    ", the outflows from galaxies throw metal enrich gas it is most likely that outflows play an important role in building up this correlation ( kobayashi et al . , 2007 ;",
    "scannapieco et al . ,",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it has been seen from observations that the amount of gas / ism expelled from a galaxy due to outflows is inversely proportional to the mass of the galaxy ( martin , 1999 ; martin 2005 ) .",
    "this is expected if the hot gas produced in sne explosions drives the outflow .",
    "roughly 10% of total sne energy would be available for driving the outflow when the sne remnants started to overlap with each other ( cox , 1972 ) .",
    "the conservation of sne energy available to drive the outflow to the kinetic energy of outflowing gas would lead to a mass outflow rate inversely proportional to the square of the circular velocity ( @xmath8 ) of the galaxy .",
    "even if the hot gas loses its thermal energy due to radiative cooling the momentum of the gas and/or the cosmic rays produced in the sne shocks can still drive the outflow ( samui et al .",
    ", 2010 ; ostriker & mckee 1988 ) . in such cases",
    "as well the inverse relation between outflowing mass and the circular velocity of the galaxy still holds with a different scaling .",
    "thus due to supernova explosions small mass galaxies would lose more gas and experience a strong negative feedback to the star formation compare to higher mass galaxies .",
    "hence , it is important to build a complete model of high redshift galaxy formation taking account of all the observational evidences , particularly the sne feedback driven star formation in high redshift galaxies and their metal transport to the igm .",
    "numerical simulations are the best way to study all these together and a tremendous effort is going on ( for example , scannapieco et al . , 2005 & 2006 ; dave , oppenheimer & sivanandam , 2008 ; dave , oppenheimer , & finlator , 2011 ; scannapieco et al . ,",
    "however , present state of art hydrodynamic simulations are far from reality .",
    "they are constrained by the resolutions as well as the amount of physical processes that they can take account together ( scannapieco et al . , 2012 ;",
    "stringer et al . 2012 ) . here",
    ", we build an analytical model of star formation in the high redshift galaxies regulated by the feedback from sne driven winds and try to explain the amount stellar mass and metals detected inside galaxies and the high redshift uv luminosity functions of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) . in past , several authors have proposed semi - analytical models in order to understand the high redshift as well as low redshift galaxy formation process ( white & frenk , 1991 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni , 1993 ; cole et al",
    ". , 1994 ; baugh et al , 1998 ; somerville & primack , 1999 ; chiu & ostriker , 2000 ; granato et al 2000 ; choudhury & srianand , 2002 ; baugh et al . , 2005 ; shankar et al 2006 ) .",
    "these works clearly demonstrated the power of such semi - analytical modeling by predicting various observations regarding high redshift universe .",
    "however , they have not derived a universal closed analytical form for the time evolution of star formation rate ( sfr ) in a single galaxy .",
    "chiu & ostriker ( 2000 ) , choudhury & srianand ( 2002 ) and some of our earlier works ( samui et al . , 2007 , 2008 ; jose et al . , 2011 ) have used such a closed form without considering the sne feedback and also not deriving their star formation model from first principle .",
    "others have just considered star formation rate to be proportional to the available cold gas and not derived a single evolution equation for the evolution of the star formation rate including feedback . here , we solve for the star formation rate in a closed form starting from very basic physics governing the star formation and taking account of the negative feedback from galactic outflows on the star formation in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this closed form will be very useful while fitting the photometric observations of high redshift galaxies in order to find their star formation history , stellar mass etc .",
    "moreover , the new data are extended to much lower in stellar mass / luminosity and higher redshift where the process of reionisation is still going on . in one hand",
    "these low mass systems are the dominating sources of reionization .",
    "on the other hand they are much likely to prone to sne feedback .",
    "hence , it is timely to revisit feedback induced star formation in high redshift galaxies in the light of new improved data sets .",
    "further , semi - analytical models are always useful as they are computationally inexpensive and help to understand the average universe very well .",
    "also it is important to explore vast range of parameters that regulates the physical processes happening inside a galaxy .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec_sfig ]",
    "we clearly state our feedback induced star formation model in galaxies and how well it explains the stellar mass detected in dwarf galaxies to high mass galaxies .",
    "the mass - metallicity - sfr relation of galaxies is discussed in section  [ sec_mass_metal ] .",
    "we present our model of uv luminosity function in section  [ sec_lf ] .",
    "we show our model predictions of uv luminosity functions of lbgs and compare that with observations in section  [ sec_fit ] .",
    "finally we draw our conclusions with some discussions in section  [ sec_cd ] . through out this paper we assume a @xmath9cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) cosmology with the cosmological parameter as obtained by recent wmap observation , i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and hubble parameter @xmath13  km / s / mpc .",
    "we model the star formation rate including the feedback from sne driven outflows in a galaxy as follows .",
    "we assume that the instantaneous star formation rate at a given time is proportional to the amount of cold gas present in the galaxy .",
    "once the dark matter halo virialises it accretes baryonic matter and a fraction , @xmath14 , of that becomes cold and available for star formation .",
    "the @xmath14 can be thought of as star formation efficiency and is a free parameter in our model .",
    "the baryon accretion rate in a galaxy of total mass @xmath15 at time @xmath16 after the formation of dark matter halo is taken as @xmath17 } \\label{eqn_accretion}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the gas mass and @xmath19 is the total baryonic mass in the halo .",
    "further , @xmath20 is the dynamical time of the galaxy ( barkana & loeb , 2001 ) .",
    "we assume that the total gas mass in the galaxy is equal to the dark matter mass times the universal dark matter to baryon mass ratio .",
    "note that integrating eq .",
    "[ eqn_accretion ] from @xmath21 to @xmath22 results @xmath23 .",
    "the exponential form of the baryon accretion rate can be understood as follows .",
    "once the dark matter halo virialises , the baryons are captured in the potential well and heated to virial temperature of the dark matter potential . in order to form stars the gas needs to cool and fall into the centre of the galaxy .",
    "if one assumes the rate of hot gas becoming cold is proportional to the amount of hot gas present , the increase in cold gas mass would follow an exponential form with time scale governed by the cooling time ( @xmath24 )",
    ". however , as already mentioned , this cold gas has to collapse into the centre of the galaxy in order to form stars .",
    "the collapse of the gas into the centre of dark matter halo is governed by the dynamical time scale of the gravitational potential . for most of the galaxy masses that we are interested , @xmath25 ( silk , 1993 ) .",
    "this is true even at the mean overdensity of the collapsed halo which is @xmath26  180 times the background density .",
    "hence the effective cold gas accretion rate can be taken as an exponential form with time scale of the order of dynamical time scale for the system .",
    "further note that the accretions of cold gas in galaxies has been found to be important observationally and also considered in previous semi - analytical models ( i.e. kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 , shankar et al .",
    "our exponential cold gas accretion rate tries to model that .",
    "such an exponential form for the cold gas accretion rate has been also used by other semi - analytical works ( for example see appendix of shankar et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "at a given time some gas would already be locked inside stars .",
    "further , the massive stars are short lived and would explode as supernova after few times @xmath27  yrs .",
    "these supernovae can drive the cold gas out of galaxy as galactic wind .",
    "we assume that the amount of gas mass driven out by the supernova in the form of wind is proportional to the instantaneous star formation rate , neglecting the time delay of @xmath28  yrs between the star formation and subsequent explosion of supernova , i.e. @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the wind mass ; @xmath31 is the star mass and over dot represents the time derivative .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath32 depends on the driving mechanism of outflows .",
    "for example , if the outflows are driven by the hot gas produced by the sne , then @xmath33 , @xmath8 being the circular velocity of the galaxy .",
    "such outflows are referred to as energy driven outflows .",
    "if the hot gas loses its energy by radiative cooling , then outflows can be potentially driven by the pressure of cosmic rays produced in the sne shocks .",
    "it was shown analytically in samui et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that in such cases @xmath33 as well .",
    "however , if the momentum of the cooled gas helps in driving the outflow , @xmath34 .",
    "these are called momentum driven outflows . detailed models of such supernova driven outflows can be found in weaver et al .",

    "( 2002 ) , veilleux , cecil , & bland - hawthorn ( 2005 ) , samui et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "finally , taking account of the mass in stars , mass in outflows and baryonic mass accreted we can write down the star formation rate at time @xmath16 after the formation of dark matter halo as @xmath35 , \\label{eqn_dmdt}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 is some proportionality constant that governs the duration of star formation . taking the time derivative of eq .",

    "\\label{eqn_dm_dt_2}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "[ eqn_dm_dt_2 ] gives the analytical form of star formation rate in a galaxy at age @xmath16 in presence of supernova feedback and is the backbone of our feedback induced star formation model .",
    "note that putting @xmath32 equals to zero would lead to star formation rate in a without feedback scenario and that form of star formation rate has been widely used in semi - analytical galaxy formation model in past by various authors ( see chiu & ostriker , 2000 ; choudhury & srianand , 2002 ; samui et al . , 2007",
    "; jose et al . , 2011 ;",
    "jose et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the total baryonic mass that will be eventually converted to stars is @xmath43 which is independent of @xmath36 and inversely proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "we have already mentioned that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the circular velocity of the halo for which @xmath47 and @xmath48 or @xmath49 depending on whether outflows are energy driven / cosmic rays driven or momentum driven .",
    "hence , for a small mass galaxy that has a lower circular velocity , @xmath32 is large compare to a high mass galaxy with higher @xmath8 .",
    "thus from eq .",
    "[ eqn_m_total ] it is clear that our model predicts a higher stellar mass fraction ( @xmath50 or equivalently @xmath51 ) in high mass galaxies and lower stellar mass fraction for small mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "the sne feedback regulates the total amount of star formed in a galaxy . for small mass dwarf galaxies",
    "the sne feedback is strong leading to a large decrease in the star formation in those galaxies .",
    "large mass galaxies due to their large gravitational potential are less prone to the sne feedback and suppression of star formation due to such feedback is small .",
    "indeed , observationally we found such a correlation between the stellar mass and circular velocity / mass of galaxy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_stellar_mass ] we show our model predictions of stellar masses as a function of both circular velocity and mass of a galaxy along with the observational data .",
    "the observed data points are taken from mcgaugh ( 2005 ) , stark et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , walker et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "note that in absence of any feedback , one expects @xmath52 which would be a straight line as shown by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_stellar_mass ] . from observational data itself it is obvious that small mass galaxies have very small amount of stars . at @xmath53 the suppression is almost two orders of magnitude compared to the universal dark matter to baryon ratio whereas at @xmath54 the suppression is almost zero .",
    "thus star formation models that do not take account of feedback fail to reproduce the observation .",
    "one must consider the negative feedback of sne on subsequent star formation in a consistent way like in our model .",
    "we show our model predictions for @xmath48 ( left panel ) i.e. energy driven sne feedback and @xmath55 i.e. momentum driven sne feedback .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in both the panels are for @xmath56  km / s and 75  km / s respectively .",
    "we choose such normalisation as they provide a reasonable good fit to the data and also in samui et al .",
    "( 2010 ) such a normalisation naturally arises for cosmic ray driven outflows ( see table  1 of samui et al . ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath57 for all the models .",
    "note that with this choice of @xmath14 , less than 20% of baryon mass is converted to star for @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that our model predictions match quite well with the observed data . for high mass galaxies with @xmath59  km / s the errors in the measurements as well as the scatter in the data are small and we obtain a good fit to the observed data for both @xmath60 and 1 .",
    "the spread in the data is within the statistical uncertainty of the model parameters .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed data sample consists of different types of galaxies . while the stark et al . ( 2009 ) galaxy samples are gas dominated spiral galaxies , the mcgaugh et al .",
    "data consists of both gas dominated as well as gas poor star mass dominated galaxies . on the other hand , the gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) samples are compendium of the early type galaxies .",
    "hence our model reproduces the observed stellar mass fraction for different galaxy population with masses @xmath61 . for small mass dwarf galaxies with @xmath62  km",
    "/ s the observational points are quite scatter although our model predictions agree reasonably well especially for @xmath60 . for @xmath55",
    "it seems that additional feedbacks other than the sne feedback are needed to suppress star formation even more in those galaxies in order o explain majority of the data points .",
    "however in any model the spread in the observational data is much more than the statistical uncertainty of the model parameters . interestingly",
    "these dwarf galaxies are mostly satellite galaxies and they are likely to be affected by tidal striping and radiative feedback from reionization that we discuss later while considering the luminosity function of lbgs .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that our simple model of star formation including only the sne feedback fails to explain the spread in the observed data for dwarf galaxies .",
    "also note that for higher values of @xmath32 one may expect the radiative cooling of the outflowing material to be important and the hot thermal gas that drives the outflows cools efficiently making the outflow a momentum driven one ( see samui et al .",
    "2009 for details example of such outflows ) .",
    "however , our models show that @xmath60 is more favourable even for low mass dwarf galaxies which points to the fact that the outflows from dwarf galaxies are most likely not momentum driven outflows .",
    "therefore , one must consider some alternative driving force for the outflows in these galaxies .",
    "in samui et .",
    "al ( 2010 ) we showed that cosmic rays can provide such alternative with correct scaling of @xmath60 .    in order to investigate this",
    "more we also consider the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass ( shm ) as a function of halo mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig_shm ] we show our model predictions along with observationally derived shm ratio by leauthaud et al . ( 2012 ) ( green shaded region ) and moster et al . (",
    "2010 ) ( cyan hatched area ) with measurement uncertainty .",
    "leauthaud et al .",
    "used deep cosmos data along with halo occupation distribution model to constrain shm ratio .",
    "moster et al .",
    "derived the shm ratio from n - body simulation with recent sdss clustering data and galaxy galaxy lensing data .",
    "even though there are slight mismatch in their derived shm ratio , our model predictions match well considering the uncertainty in measurement . here",
    "also we see that momentum driven cases ( @xmath55 ) provide a poorer fit to the derived shm ratio compared to @xmath60 models in low mass region .",
    "we wish to point out that the decrease in shm ratio for @xmath63 is due to agn feedback that we have not considered here .",
    "also the observed galaxies have a limiting stellar mass of @xmath64 corresponds to @xmath65 that has been used to derived the shm .",
    "hence one should not compare our model predictions with this particular observation beyond this mass limit .",
    "in this section we focus on the gas phase metallicity of the high redshift galaxies in order to understand the observed mass - metallicity relation .",
    "the metallicity of a galaxy in our model can be calculated as follows .",
    "we assume that the amount of metals ejected by the supernova per unit of star formation is @xmath66 and these metals are mixed with the ism instantaneously .",
    "suppose at a given time the metallicity of the ism is @xmath67 .",
    "if at that instance @xmath68 amount of stars are formed then total gas mass reduced from the ism is @xmath69 .",
    "the second term arises due to the loss of gas through outflows .",
    "note that we neglect the recycled gas that is returned by the supernova into the ism as it is very small .",
    "for example , in a salpeter imf from @xmath70 the return fraction is less than 15% . given @xmath68 of star formation",
    ", the amount of metal lost from the ism is @xmath71 .",
    "however , supernova will produce @xmath72 metals . hence total change of metal mass ( @xmath73 ) in the ism",
    "is @xmath74\\delta m_*.\\ ] ] recall that @xmath75 . differentiating this and using above relations we obtain @xmath76 \\delta m _ * \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating this with boundary condition that the initial metallicity of the collapsed gas is @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath78 \\label{eqn_mass_metal}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_mass_metal ] we show our model prediction for stellar mass metallicity relation .",
    "note that the stellar mass is obtained from eq .",
    "[ eqn_m_total ] and metallicity is obtained from eq .",
    "[ eqn_mass_metal ] .",
    "the observed data points are taken from erb et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the sample of galaxies at @xmath79 .",
    "we take @xmath80 which means one supernova will form per @xmath81 of star formation and it will produce @xmath82 of oxygen ( starburst99 : leitherer et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "further , we assume @xmath83 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that our models reproduce the observed correlation very well .",
    "especially , for the case of @xmath60 models , the two normalisation circular velocities namely @xmath84 and 125  km / s nicely bracket the observed correlation function .",
    "predicted mass metallicity correlation by @xmath55 models is flatter than the observed values .",
    "therefore , this correlation also favours the @xmath60 models compared to @xmath55 models which produce poorer fit to the observation . and",
    "we conclude that the wind feedback is the main driver to determine the amount of metals in galaxies .    as we have discussed early ,",
    "recent observations have pointed out that the correlation of stellar mass and gas phase metallicity actually comes from a projection of more fundamental 3-d relationship between stellar mass , metallicity and star formation rate of galaxies .",
    "the offset seen in the mass metallicity relation between local universe and high redshift universe is due to selection bias of observing only higher star forming galaxies at high redshift ( mannucci et al . 2010 ) .",
    "hence any model of galaxy formation should be able to reproduce this fundamental 3-d relation .",
    "indeed our models do predict such a correlation between stellar mass , metallicity and sfr . in fig .",
    "[ fig_fmr ] we show both projections of this relationship as predicted by our models along with the observational data taken from mannucci et al .",
    "the top panels show metallicity as a function of stellar mass ( the color shaded area ) as obtained from all the four models discussed above ( the parameters of each model is indicated in each panel ) .",
    "the color bar represent the star formation rate of the galaxy . in each panel",
    "the color codded curves are the observational data with same color indicator for the star formation rate . in the bottom panels we show the metallicity as a function of star formation rate for a range of stellar masses .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that our models produce the 3-d correlation observed in galaxies .",
    "all our models produces the trend , i.e. for a given stellar mass , higher star forming galaxies have lower metallicity compared to low star forming counterparts or for a given star formation higher metallicity is obtained for higher stellar mass .",
    "however , it is interesting to point out that the model with @xmath60 and @xmath84  km / s provides the best fit with the observation .",
    "note that in this case the model has to reproduce both the projections simultaneously .",
    "like , the model with @xmath60 and @xmath56  km / s provide good fit with mass - metallicity relation but does not reproduce spread in sfr - metallicity relation . both the models with @xmath55 unable to explain the correctly the observational data .",
    "we therefore conclude like in previous section that the observations are well reproduced by @xmath60 models again indicating the importance of cosmic ray driven winds .",
    "after successfully explaining the stellar and metal mass detected in galaxies , we turn to the high redshift uv luminosity functions of lbgs . we broadly follow samui et al . ( 2007 & 2009 ) to calculate high redshift luminosity functions .",
    "below we briefly describe our model .",
    "we obtain luminosity evolution of a galaxy undergoing a burst of one unit of star formation at a specific wavelength ( say @xmath85   ) from population synthesis code  starburst99 \" ( leitherer et al . , 1999 ) assuming some initial mass function throughout this paper . ] for the stars formed .",
    "we convolve that with star formation rate of individual galaxy in our model ( i.e. eq .",
    "[ eqn_dm_dt_2 ] ) to obtain the luminosity as a function of galaxy age ( see eq .  6 of samui et al . , 2007 and also fig .  1 there ) .",
    "note that the difference with samui et al .",
    "( 2007 ) model is that here we explicitly use the sne feedback to the star formation .",
    "further , all the light produced inside a galaxy by the stars do not reach to us due to presence of dust .",
    "a fraction , @xmath86 , of total luminosity of the galaxy can be observed from earth .",
    "we assume each luminous galaxy is formed inside a virialised dark matter halo provided the gas can cool and host star formation .",
    "the formation rate of dark matter halos per unit volume , @xmath87 , at a given redshift is calculated by taking the redshift derivative of sheth - tormen mass function ( sheth & tormen , 1999 ) .",
    "the sheth - tormen ( st ) mass function provides a good fit to the numerical simulation data ( brandbyge et al . , 2010 )",
    "and hence we use it to calculate the formation rate of dark matter halos .",
    "note that the time derivative of mass function provides total change in the number of halos ; not just formation rate .",
    "one can extend sasaki formalism ( sasaki , 1994 ) for press - schechter mass function in order to get formation rate of halos from st mass function .",
    "however , it is well know that naive extension of this formalism does not work for other mass functions ( samui et al .",
    ", 2009 ; mitra et al , 2011 ) .",
    "hence we use the simple time derivative to get the formation rate of halos with the assumption that it closely follows the formation rate .",
    "however , to show the effect of mass function on the predicted luminosity functions , we also consider press - schechter ( ps ) mass function with sasaki formalism to calculate the formation rate of dark matter halos .",
    "in particular , we want to see if the conclusion of samui et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is still valid with the new feedback induced star formation model .",

    "we have built improved semi - analytical models of high redshift galaxy formation where star formation is regulated by the feedback due to sne driven outflows .",

    ". for low mass dwarf galaxies our simple model of star formation including sne feedback produces the trend in correlation between the observed stellar mass and circular velocity but fails to explain the spread in it .",

    "our models also produces the observed ratio of stellar mass to halo mass as a function of halo masses as obtained from recent sdss data .",
    "further , our models emphasize the importance of alternative driver of galactic outflows such as cosmic rays .",

    "this implies that the supernova feedback affects the star formation in galaxies more compare to ionisation feedback for high mass galaxies . for galaxies with @xmath145  km",
    "/ s one expects to have no effect of ionization feedback to the star formation where as sne feedback reduces the star formation by 40% in the same galaxies ( taking @xmath84  km / s ) .",
    "the present observational data of high redshift luminosity functions is not good enough to distinguish a thermal energy driven outflow from a momentum driven outflow .",
    "we need to reduce the error in the measurements and extend the data to even lower luminosity end where these two models behave differently .",
    "moreover , the flattening of the luminosity functions can not be explained as the difference between the form of halo mass function that one uses to calculate the formation rate of halos ( like ps or st mass function ) .",
    "it can only be understood due to sne feedback .",
    "hence , our feedback regulated star formation model can explain a vast range of observations of high redshift universe .",
    "having such kind of simple analytical form for physically motivated star formation of individual galaxy is very helpful for determining the star formation rate of high redshift galaxies by fitting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with several broad band photometry . in such case",
    "the star formation history is very important to determine several physical quantities such as the star formation rate , stellar mass , age of the galaxy etc .",
    "in general one considers a constant star formation model or an exponentially decaying one in such fits .",
    "however , reddy et al . ( 2012 ) showed that high redshift galaxies ( @xmath146 ) are more expected to have a rising star formation history and very young age when they are detected .",
    "our successful star formation models actually predict such kind of rising star formation history at the young age and then gradually decreasing star formation history after a fraction of dynamical time . we expect",
    "that using our model in such sed fitting would lead to a better fit to the observational data and also provide more clearer picture of high redshift galaxies .",
    "since sne feedback is one of the main improvement of our model over past , it is important to investigate its effect on the global metal pollution . especially by the fact that in low mass galaxies that dominate in the metal production at high redshift should have a cosmic ray pressure driven outflows , one should see how far this model can explain the global metal budget .",

    "<S> our models reproduce the observed 3-d fundamental correlation between the stellar mass , gas phase metallicity and star formation rate in galaxies establishing that the sne feedback plays a major role in building this relation . </S>",
    "<S> further , the observed uv luminosity functions of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) are well explained by our feedback induced star formation model for a vast redshift range of @xmath1 . in particular , the flattening of the luminosity functions at the low luminosity end naturally arises due to our explicit sne feedback treatment .    </S>",
