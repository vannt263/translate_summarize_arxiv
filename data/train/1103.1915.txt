    "except for kr  7 , all of the regions we examine have clump mass distributions that are consistent with the typical clump structure index of @xmath178 associated with molecular cloud structure @xcite .",
    "the kr  7 clumps are an interesting outlier as they have a very steep index ( the first @xmath179 of the sources contain about @xmath180 of the total mass ) more typical of a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) that is usually only seen in smaller ( 1000 au scale ) structure within molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it appears the relationship holds over four orders of magnitude in mass , extending another order of magnitude to lower mass less than found in @xcite and two orders of magnitude lower in mass than shown in .",
    "this is significant because a constant ratio of luminosity to associated mass is what is expected if star formation follows the same imf in all star forming regions and that the star formation efficiency for converting gas into stars is the same over many orders of magnitude in associated mass .",
    "three ring - like morphology regions in the outer galaxy , kr  7 , kr  81 , and kr  120 ( sh 2 - 124 , sh 2 - 165 , and sh 2 - 187 ) , have been investigated using scuba 850 @xmath0 m observations and molecular line observations ( @xmath17co , @xmath18co and c@xmath19o ) .",
