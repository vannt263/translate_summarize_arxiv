    "large anisotropic flow has been observed in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic flow is an azimuthal ( @xmath0 ) asymmetry of the single - particle distribution  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ( complex ) anisotropic flow coefficient in the @xmath3th harmonic .",
    "one usually uses the notation @xmath4 for the magnitude : @xmath5 .",
    "anisotropic flow is understood as the hydrodynamic response to spatial deformation of the initial density profile .",
    "this profile fluctuates event to event , which implies that the flow also fluctuates  @xcite .",
    "the recognition of the importance of flow fluctuations has led to a wealth of new flow observables , among which triangular flow  @xcite and higher harmonics , as well as correlations between different fourier harmonics  @xcite .",
    "flow fluctuations provide a window  @xcite into both the early stage dynamics and the transport properties of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "specifically , the magnitudes of higher - order harmonics ( @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) are increasingly sensitive to the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio  @xcite .",
    "the distributions of @xmath8 and @xmath6 carry detailed information about the initial density profile  @xcite , while @xmath9 and higher harmonics are understood as superpositions of linear and nonlinear responses , through which they are correlated with lower - order harmonics  @xcite .",
    "ideally , one would like to measure the full probability distribution @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "so far , only limited information has been obtained , concerning either the distribution of a single @xmath2  @xcite or specific angular correlations between different harmonics  @xcite .",
    "we propose to study the distribution @xmath10 via its moments in various harmonics  @xcite , either single or mixed , and illustrate our point with realistic simulations using the ampt model  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ s : method ] , we recall how moments can be measured simply with a single rapidity gap  @xcite",
    ". this procedure is less demanding in terms of detector acceptance than the one based on several rapidity windows separated pairwise by gaps @xcite , and can be used to study even four - plane correlators . in sec .",
    "[ s : old ] , we list standard measures of flow fluctuations which have been used in the literature and express them in terms of moments . in sec .  [",
    "s : new ] , we introduce new observables which shed additional light on the origin of event - plane correlations .",
    "for instance , a correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath9 has been observed , which increases with impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "this correlation is usually understood  @xcite as an effect of the non - linear hydrodynamic response which creates a @xmath9 proportional to @xmath11  @xcite : the increase in the correlation is thus assumed to result from the increase of elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "we show that this hypothesis can be tested directly by studying how the correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath9 is correlated with the magnitude of @xmath8 .",
    "we also investigate in a similar way the origin of the three - plane correlation between @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath2 are contained in its moments , which are average values of products of @xmath2 , of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are integers , and angular brackets denote an average value over events .",
    "note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "azimuthal symmetry implies that the only nontrivial moments satisfy  @xcite @xmath18    we now describe a simple procedure for measuring these moments , which applies to harmonics @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "( we do not study here moments involving directed flow @xmath21  @xcite . )",
    "we define in each collision the flow vector  @xcite by @xmath22 where the sum runs over @xmath23 particles seen in a reference detector , and @xmath24 are their azimuthal angles . in eq .",
    "( [ defqcomplex ] ) means that we choose to average over particles in each event  @xcite , rather than summing  @xcite or dividing by @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this choice is discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ s : old ] .",
    "] one typically measures @xmath26 in two different parts of the detector ( `` subevents ''  @xcite ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are symmetric around midrapidity and separated by a gap in pseudorapidity ( i.e. , polar angle )  @xcite .",
    "the moment ( [ defmoments ] ) is then given by @xmath29 which one can symmetrize over @xmath27 and @xmath28 to decrease the statistical error .",
    "this configuration , with all factors of @xmath26 on one side and all factors of @xmath30 on the other side  @xcite , suppresses nonflow correlations and self correlations as long as only harmonics @xmath19 are involved .",
    "an alternative procedure , where self correlations are explicitly subtracted , is described in  @xcite .    in order to illustrate the validity of the method , we perform calculations using the ampt model  @xcite .",
    "ampt reproduces quite well lhc data for anisotropic flow ( @xmath31 to @xmath32 ) at all centralities  @xcite .",
    "the implementation adopted in this paper  @xcite uses initial conditions from the hijing 2.0 model  @xcite , which contains nontrivial event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "flow in ampt is produced by elastic scatterings in the partonic phase .",
    "in addition , the model contains resonance decays , and thus nontrivial nonflow effects . in the present work ,",

    "the thumb rule for measuring moments is that smaller values of @xmath3 are easier to measure because @xmath4 decreases with @xmath3 for @xmath19 .",
    "lower order moments , corresponding to smaller values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are also easier because higher - order moments are plagued with large variances , which entail large statistical errors .",

    "fluctuations of @xmath4 have been studied using cumulants  @xcite , which are linear combinations of even moments of the distribution of @xmath4 , that is , @xmath40 .",

    "[ s : method ] .",
    "the scaled moment @xmath43 thus defined is invariant if one multiplies @xmath4 by a constant , therefore it reflects the statistics of @xmath4 and should be essentially independent of the detector acceptance .",
    "ampt calculations are in fair agreement with the atlas data @xcite , but tend to slightly overpredict @xmath43 , i.e. , overestimate flow fluctuations .    if flow is solely created by fluctuations and if the statistics of these fluctuations is a 2-dimensional gaussian  @xcite , then @xmath44 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scal](b ) , @xmath45 for all centralities , as expected since @xmath46 is only from fluctuations in pb - pb collisions .",

    "[ fig : scal](a ) , @xmath47 is roughly equal to @xmath48 for central collisions where @xmath31 is mostly from gaussian fluctuations , but decreases for mid - central collisions , corresponding to the emergence of a mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "event - plane correlations  @xcite can also be expressed in terms of moments which can be measured using the method outlined in sec .",
    "[ s : method ] , as already discussed in ref .",
    ". specifically , two - plane correlations are pearson correlation coefficients between moments .",

    "this correlation measure equals unity if @xmath49 and @xmath50 are uncorrelated , and is larger than unity if there is a positive correlation .",
    "it is in general easier to measure than the pearson correlation coefficient , because it does not involve the higher - order moments @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the `` standard candles '' introduced in ref .",

    "all other correlations are positive .",
    "the correlation between @xmath77 and @xmath31 , and that between @xmath78 and @xmath46 , become smaller for more central collisions , which is likely due to the smaller non - linear contributions  @xcite of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",

    "however , the centrality selection in experiments is typically done using the multiplicity in a reference detector ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) so that effects of multiplicity fluctuations are likely to be small in narrow centrality intervals .",

    "equation  ( [ model ] ) then implies the following relation between moments : @xmath88 this equation relates a mixed correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 to the fluctuations of elliptic flow : the right - hand side is the scaled moment @xmath89 introduced in eq .",
