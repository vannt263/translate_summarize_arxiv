    "quantum spin chains continue to be an active focus of research largely because they serve as interesting model systems to explore strongly correlated quantum order in low dimensional antiferromagnets,@xcite superconductors@xcite and ultracold atoms.@xcite a significant fraction of current research is devoted to the understanding of frustrated quantum magnets , which display a host of exotic ground states.@xcite one of the agents responsible for magnetic frustration is the dzyaloshinskii - moriya@xcite interaction , @xmath0 , which originates from spin - orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry .",
    "@xmath1 is the spin operator at site @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the dm vector . since this interaction may induce spiral spin arrangements in the ground state,@xcite it is intertwined with ferroelectricity in multiferroic spin chains.@xcite besides , the dm interaction plays an important role in explaining the electron spin resonance experiments in some one - dimensional antiferromagnets.@xcite moreover , the dm interaction modifies the dynamic properties@xcite and quantum entanglement@xcite of spin chains .",
    "the present work is motivated by an elegant recent study@xcite that has predicted intriguing field - induced antiferromagnetic order in heisenberg spin 1/2 chains with uniform dm interaction ( @xmath4 for any @xmath5 ) . a crucial aspect of ref .",
    "[ ] is that the external magnetic field is taken to be ( nearly ) transverse to the dm vector , so that the system has fully broken spin rotational symmetry",
    ". the main objectives of our work are to generalize the analysis of ref .",
    "[ ] for the case of nonzero symmetric exchange anisotropy as well as to find new physical contexts where it might be experimentally testable .",
    "we begin in section ii by introducing the pertinent spin model . in section",
    "iii we identify the classical ground states using the large - spin approximation .",
    "although some features predicted by the classical analysis are erroneous , most of the classical ground states have a correspondent in the more rigorous quantum analysis performed in section iv .",
    "in particular , we derive a new result regarding how a magnetic field component along the dm vector modifies the classical soliton - lattice phase .",
    "section iv is divided in two subsections which complement each other to an extent .",
    "the first subsection approaches the problem from a non - abelian bosonization perspective and is constructed around the elegant chiral rotation introduced in refs .",
    "[ ] . this subsection constitutes the core of the present work .",
    "the second subsection revisits the problem from an abelian bosonization viewpoint , and may be skipped on a first reading without loss of continuity .",
    "the phase diagram is richest in the case of weak easy - plane anisotropy . in this regime",
    "there are three competing ground states : ( i ) an antiferromagnet with neel vector in the plane spanned by the dm vector and the magnetic field , ( ii ) a _ dimerized _ antiferromagnet with neel vector perpendicular to both the dm vector and the magnetic field , and ( iii ) a gapless luttinger liquid . phase ( i )",

    "[ ] at the isotropic exchange point .",
    "we demonstrate that this phase is fragile under weak - to - moderate easy - plane symmetric exchange anisotropy , and estimate the critical value of the anisotropy beyond which it disappears .",
    "furthermore , we show that a very small magnetic field component along the direction of the dm vector suffices to destabilize phase ( i ) in the neighborhood of the isotropic exchange point .",
    "thus the experimental detectability of phase ( i ) appears unlikely except in chains with _ easy - axis _ anisotropy .",
    "phases ( ii ) and ( iii ) emerge as a consequence of symmetric exchange anisotropy and constitute the main findings of this work .",
    "the luttinger liquid ground state prevails when the dm interaction is large compared to the magnetic field perpendicular to the dm vector , and the antiferromagnetic phase is stabilized under the opposite condition .",
    "even though the outcomes of the abelian and non - abelian methods agree roughly , the former method misses a few key features such as the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and dimerization in phase ( ii ) .",
    "this is more a merit of the chiral rotation carried out in conjunction with the non - abelian treatment than an intrinsic flaw of the abelian bosonization .    in section",
    "v we recast the magnetic model onto a mathematically equivalent problem that consists of a one - dimensional josephson junction array located in close proximity to a bulk superconductor and placed under a magnetic field .",
    "the analysis of section iv can be directly transferred to determine the phase diagram of this system at small or large magnetic fields , depending on whether the array is made of @xmath6-junctions or conventional junctions , respectively .",

    "circulating supercurrents flow between the array and the bulk superconductor .",
    "the magnitude of these circulating currents oscillates from one `` plaquette '' to another ; this is how dimerization manifests itself in the superconducting context .",
    "the magnetic luttinger liquid maps into a state in which the josephson coupling between the superconducting islands and the bulk superconductor becomes irrelevant .",
    "the transitions between these phases may be controlled with external magnetic fields and by engineering material parameters .",

    "this approximation is safest when the effective london penetration depth is larger than the size of the array.@xcite    let us discuss the phase diagram of a conventional array with @xmath414 , which in the magnetic problem corresponds to @xmath120 . when @xmath407 , the order parameter of the jj array is aligned ferromagnetically with that of the bulk superconductor .",
    "although this result does not follow from the field theoretical calculations of the present paper , its counterpart in quantum spin chains is well - established . in effect , for @xmath415 and @xmath30 the superconducting model becomes equivalent to a spin 1/2 antiferromagnet with _ staggered _ dm interaction in a transverse magnetic field , which was first studied in ref .",
    "the ground state in this case was found to be antiferromagnetic with the neel vector aligned with the external field . in pseudospin language",
    "this translates into the aforementioned ferromagnetic ground state .    as the magnetic field increases the pseudospins of the jj array are increasingly twisted , with the concomitant loss of exchange energy .",
    "for @xmath416 , it is no longer optimal to have a ferromagnetic alignment between the array and the bulk superconducting angles .",
    "instead , the ground state is `` @xmath43 '' ( if @xmath417 ) or @xmath53 ( if @xmath418 ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath419 , `` @xmath49 '' emerges as the ground state at @xmath420 .",
    "finding `` @xmath49 '' at @xmath414 is counterintuitive because it means that the proximity coupling from the bulk superconductor drives the array into an _ insulating _ ground state . by tuning @xmath13 or the applied ( real ) magnetic field",
    ", one may induce transitions between the three phases .",
    "in particular , if @xmath421 there is a commensurate - incommensurate transition between @xmath53 and `` @xmath43 '' . the critical value of the proximity coupling for this transition is @xmath422 this critical field changes in presence of a gate voltage ( @xmath14 ) as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hc2 ] ) .",
    "the experimental detection of the aforementioned phases requires squid measurements,@xcite which would target the circulating currents of `` @xmath43 '' ground states , as well as measurements of the critical current of the array,@xcite which would be exponentially suppressed with the length of the array in the `` @xmath49 '' ground state@xcite but not in the @xmath53 phase .",
    "we briefly comment on a number of additional experimental requirements :    \\(i ) the josephson coupling between the islands in the array must be stronger than the coupling between the islands and the bulk superconductor , because our field theoretical results apply for @xmath423 . moreover , our model applies for short - ranged coulomb interactions in the array , i.e. for @xmath424 .",
    "\\(ii ) the temperature of the system must be smaller than the gaps in the `` @xmath43 '' and `` @xmath49 '' ground states : @xmath425 . for typical values of the josephson coupling ( @xmath426 for low - temperature superconductors )",
    "this requirement is most pressing at @xmath427 , where the energy gap associated with `` @xmath49 '' is only @xmath428 ( recall section iva ) .",
    "as @xmath429 and @xmath367 are made dissimilar the gaps may increase to @xmath430 .",
    "( iii ) the array must be long enough so as to reduce the quantum tunneling between degenerate ground states . in effect , `` @xmath43 '' and `` @xmath49 '' each break a @xmath431 symmetry : there are two degenerate `` @xmath49 '' or `` @xmath43 '' phases that differ from each other only by a translation of a lattice constant .",
    "\\(iv ) the superconducting grains must be small enough to justify the pseudospin 1/2 approximation . at the same time",
    "the area of a plaquette ( @xmath432 ) should be large enough to enclose a flux @xmath433 using magnetic fields that are smaller than the critical field of the superconducting islands ( note that this concern does not apply to arrays of @xmath6-junctions , for which we require @xmath407 ) .",
    "the `` inverted - t '' shape of the islands depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jj_array ] could help satisfy both conditions . for aluminum",
    ", @xmath434 would ensure that the applied field remains below the critical field.@xcite",
    "we have evaluated the zero - temperature phase diagram of an antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain in presence of uniform dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , symmetric exchange anisotropy and arbitrarily oriented magnetic fields .",
    "we have used non - abelian as well as abelian bosonization , and have generally found qualitative agreement between the two schemes .",
    "when the two diverge , the former approach proves to be more reliable .",
    "our calculations predict the emergence of three competing phases for spin chains with easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "one of them ( phase ( i ) ) is an antiferromagnet with its neel vector along the direction of the dm vector .",
    "this phase was introduced in previous work,@xcite whose scope was limited by the assumption of isotropic symmetric exchange .",
    "our results indicate that phase ( i ) is unstable under weak - to - moderate easy - plane anisotropy : we have estimated the critical value of the anisotropy beyond which it disappears .",
    "this value is sensitive to the magnitude of the dm interaction , as well as to the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the two new ground states that occur as a consequence of symmmetric easy - plane exchange anisotropy are ( ii ) a dimerized antiferromagnet with neel vector perpendicular to both the dm vector and the magnetic field , ( iii ) a gapless luttinger liquid , whose classical counterpart is a soliton lattice . phase ( ii )",
    "arises when the dm interaction is weak compared to the magnetic field component transverse to the dm vector ; phase ( iii ) ensues in the opposite regime .",
    "phase ( i ) may then be understood as an outcome of the frustration between competing phases ( ii ) and ( iii ) ; indeed it is most likely to emerge when the dm interaction is neither large nor small compared to the transverse magnetic field component .",
    "it would be interesting to verify and refine these predictions using the numerical density - matrix renormalization group method .",
    "motivated in part by the scarcity of experiments on one - dimensional antiferromagnets with uniform dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , we have searched for alternative systems where our calculations may be experimentally tested .",
    "thus we have mapped the original magnetic problem into a mathematically equivalent superconducting problem involving a one - dimensional array of josephson junctions ( either conventional or @xmath6-type junctions ) in close proximity to a bulk superconductor .",
    "an applied perpendicular magnetic field plays the role of a uniform dm interaction . we have discussed the physical meaning of the magnetic phases in the superconducting context , including that of dimerization .",
    "the exquisite tunability of josephson junction parameters in one - dimensional arrays may provide an interesting avenue to probe and replicate the influence of dm interactions and magnetic fields in one - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets with symmetric exchange anisotropy .",
