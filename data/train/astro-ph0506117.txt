    "galactic structure has long been recognized as a key constraint on theories of galaxy formation .",
    "the presence of two distinct components  disks and spheroids  suggests that at least two separate physical mechanisms were active during the formation of spiral galaxies . within the milky way",
    ", however , detailed analyses of the kinematics and chemistry of nearby stars have revealed additional components : a thin disk with scale heights dependent on age , a thick disk and a stellar halo .",
    "each of these components place unique constraints on the galaxy s evolution . in particular , the ages and metallicities of the old thin disk , thick disk and halo indicate that they are remnants of the initial stages in the assembly of the galaxy and thus constrain the early evolution of galaxies",
    ".    several scenarios for the creation of the old thin and thick disks are consistent with current observations in the milky way .",
    "these scenarios can be categorized into three main types : ( 1 ) the creation of a thick disk from a thin disk by heating by molecular clouds , spiral arms , star formation or accretion events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 2 ) the slow collapse of the proto - galaxy forming the thick and thin disk in succession ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 3 ) the formation of a thick disk from mergers , either by direct accretion of stars or by _ in situ _ formation from accreted gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this last scenario",
    "the thin disk would likely form by a settling of gas from the merger events .",
    "it is widely assumed that the stellar halo forms from accreted satellites ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "determination of which processes are important in galaxy formation requires the study of stellar components in other galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , detailed analyses of older stellar components are difficult outside the milky way .",
    "some thick disks and stellar halos have been identified using broad - band surface photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but their low surface brightness precludes all but a most cursory study of their structure and stellar content .",
    "recently , hst imaging has begun to allow richer analyses of the resolved stars in the thick disk and halo @xcite .",
    "the resulting color - magnitude diagrams can provide robust constraints on the metallicities and ages of the stars which dominate these old components in other galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of a large database of acs imaging of nearby edge - on galaxies to analyze the stellar populations of the galaxies as a function of height above the galaxy midplane ( `` disk height '' ) .",
    "the wide field of view of acs allows us to track changes in the color - magnitude diagram to more than 3 kpc above the plane .",
    "moreover , our sample galaxies have much lower masses than the milky way , and thus constrain how the extraplanar stellar content varies with galaxy mass .",
    "the properties of the sample and their global color - magnitude diagrams are given in @xcite ( paper i ) . in this paper , we study the spatially resolved stellar populations in eight fields of six galaxies that were close enough to determine accurate tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) distances . in particular , we show that there is a significant stellar population high above the plane of these galaxies and that these stars are old and metal - poor , comparable to high - latitude stellar populations in the milky way .    in  2 , we review the results of paper i for these six galaxies and describe the completeness corrections used to correct the stellar number counts in the remainder of the paper . in ",
    "3 we show that we trace stars in the host galaxies out to many scale heights and that these stars have a larger scale height than expected from fits to 2mass @xmath2 band images . in  4 we select three populations of stars from color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and show that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age .",
    "we derive metallicity distribution functions for the extended stellar component in  5 and then conclude by discussing our results in a broader context in  6 .",

    "the latter two parameters were determined from 2-d model fits to 2mass @xmath2 band data , presented in paper i. the vertical component of these models is defined using the distribution of an isothermal population of stars @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the surface brightness or density at a position @xmath12 above the midplane , and @xmath13 is the scale height .",

    "none of the galaxies has an apparent bulge component , although ngc  4244 does have a prominent central stellar cluster , which is clearly visible in the acs and 2mass @xmath2 band images .",
    "our observations include eight hst / acs fields in the six galaxies shown in table  1 and are described fully in paper  i @xcite .",
    "these observations were obtained to study the dust - lane properties of these galaxies , and hence are centered on the galaxy midplane .",
    "the dimensions of these eight fields are given in table  2 , which shows the minimum and maximum disk radius in terms of the scale length and the minimum and maximum disk height in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "in general , each field is located close to the center of the galaxy .",
    "however , two of the galaxies , ngc  55 and ngc  4631 have additional fields located further out in the disk that are given a -disk suffix .",

    ", we focus on the vertical distributions of the stars , and where not otherwise noted , analyze all data at the same disk height together .",

    "further details on the components can be found in  4.1 and in paper i. the boxes shown in figure  1 isolating these components will be discussed in greater detail in  4 .",
    "as described in paper i , we conducted extensive artificial star tests to characterize the completeness in each field as a function of magnitude , color and location .",
    "the galaxies in our sample have high surface brightnesses near their midplane making the completeness there much lower ( see fig .  2 from paper  i ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to analyze the vertical distribution of stellar populations , and therefore correcting for this varying completeness is critical .    for each field , over 5 million artificial stars",
    "were inserted at random positions , with magnitudes between f606w of 18 and 29 , and with f606w - f814w colors between -1 and 3 .",
    "these stars were then run through the same pipeline used to determine the stellar photometry .",
    "artificial stars that coincided with actual sources were considered detected only if the input magnitude of the artificial star was brighter than the actual source in both bands .    to enable completeness corrections for individual stars",
    ", we determined our completeness for the artificial stars in bins of magnitude , color and local surface brightness . for the magnitude and color , we used 0.15 magnitude wide bins . at its steepest ,",
    "the completeness as a function of magnitude varies by at most 6% over 0.15 magnitudes , so any error introduced by the binning should be smaller than that . we then determined the size of the surface brightness bins such that there would be @xmath1650 stars in each final bin .",
    "determining the completeness from 50 stars gives a random error in the completeness of @xmath166% .",
    "an aperture around each star from 11 to 14 pixels was used to determine the local surface brightness .",
    "we determined the surface brightness level from the f606w image so as to include the effects of the hii region emission visible in a number of galaxies ( most notably ngc 55 , which therefore has the brightest completeness level in fig .  2 ) .",
    "this emission is not seen at all in the f814w images , due to the lack of strong emission lines in f814w bandpass . using this binned completeness function , we are able to determine the completeness of any individual star based on its color , magnitude and local surface brightness level to within @xmath1610% . in the stellar density profiles presented in  3 &",
    " 4 , the completeness corrections are up to 200% near the midplane , but fall to @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to correcting for the completeness , magnitude limits must also be set to insure that we are not using stars fainter than we can detect in the higher surface brightness regions of the image ( i.e. the midplane ) .",
    "we therefore choose to limit our analysis to regions of the cmd that fall above a conservative 20% completeness limit in regions of high surface brightness .",
    "figure  2 shows the 20% completeness limits for the brightest regions in each field .",
    "as can be seen , the completeness limit rises towards redder colors , and steepens at colors redder than f606w - f814w of 1 . to make a smooth boundary that is easily applied to our data , we fit the 20% completeness curves to two lines intersecting at f606w - f814w=1 .",
    "table  2 shows the results of these fits , by giving the completeness limit at f606w - f814w of -1 ( f814w@xmath19 ) , 1 ( f814w@xmath20 ) , and 3 ( f814w@xmath21 ) .",
    "we use these limits throughout this paper to insure that comparisons made between stellar populations at different disk heights are valid .",
    "we note here that although we can correct for incompleteness due to crowding , we can not correct for the attenuation of stars by dust .",
    "we will show in  4 that all the galaxies in our sample are optically thick near their midplanes . therefore at low galactic latitudes , our completeness corrected stellar census will fall short of the true number of stars .",

    "although the @xmath2 band light is often thought to be dominated by the rgb stars that trace an old stellar population , we will show in  4 that in these low mass , late - type galaxies , it more closely traces the young and intermediate age populations and is thus dominated by red supergiant and agb stars .",

    "we now turn our analysis to stars selected in regions of our cmds that isolate stellar populations with different ages . using this method",
    "we show that the older stellar populations have an increasing scale height . in  4.3 , we examine the variation of scale height in the context of disk heating models .",
    "we then present simplistic dust models in  4.4 and show that the dust extinction in these galaxies is distributed in a component that is broader than the young stellar populations .",
    "we attempt to separate our data into young , intermediate , and old stellar populations by selecting stars from different regions in the cmd .",
    "the young stars are found in the main sequence ( ms ) component and in the red and blue helium burning ( rheb , bheb ) sequences ( see paper i , fig .  1 for a schematic cmd ) , all of which should contain stars under a few 100 myr in age . for the intermediate age stars we select agb stars brighter than and redward of the rgb , resulting in ages ranging between a few 100 myr and a few gyr .",
    "lastly , for the old population of stars we select rgb stars , which have ages in excess of 1 gyr , although some agb stars will also be found in the same region .",

    "the ms region was defined by taking all stars redward of -0.5 and blueward of a line with slope of 3.3 and a color of 0.7 at the trgb magnitude .",
    "finally , the agb region isolates stars less than two magnitudes brighter than the trgb magnitude and redwards of a line with slope of 3.3 and a color of 1.2 at the trgb magnitude .",
    "these boundaries were combined with the trgb magnitude given in table  1 and the completeness limits from table  3 to determine the final regions for each galaxy shown in figure  1 . the regions were chosen somewhat conservatively - e.g. we chose to put space between the ms / heb section and the rgb so that there would be little overlap between the two due to dust extinction or large photometric errors at faint magnitudes . from here we will refer to the stars in these cmd boxes as the ms , agb and rgb stellar populations .      to determine the typical ages of stars detected in our cmd boxes and to facilitate quantitative comparisons between galaxies and their different stellar populations , we generated synthetic cmds using the match program @xcite and the iac - star program @xcite , using isochrones of @xcite and @xcite in both cases .",

    "is assumed between 0.1 and 120 m@xmath30 , whereas in the iac - star cmd we used the default @xcite imf , which is steeper at the high mass end ( @xmath31 ) .    to compare these cmds to our observations",
    ", the synthetic stars were first transformed from johnson v & i to vegamag f606w & f814w colors .",
    "we then mimicked observations of each galaxy as follows .",
    "first , each star was randomly assigned a surface brightness value based on the values of detected stars in each frame .",
    "then , using the artificial star tests , we determined the chance each star was detected and a magnitude error based on the star s",
    "initial f606w & f814w magnitudes ( assuming the distance moduli shown in table  1 ) and the surface brightness value .",
    "a final cmd was then made by randomly determining if each star was detected and applying the determined errors .",
    "the resulting cmds looked qualitatively similar to our observed cmds , with the most notable difference being an offset of the agb stars to somewhat brighter magnitudes in both synthetic cmds relative to the real data and a deficit of ms / heb stars in the iac - star cmds relative to the match and the real galaxy cmds .",
    "this could indicate either that the galaxies have enhanced recent star formation or that their imf is not as steep as the @xcite imf on the high mass end .",
    "figure  4 shows the resulting age distribution of the ms , agb , and rgb boxes in ngc  4144 using the match and iac - star synthetic cmds .",
    "the age distributions for other galaxies are similar .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that we are separating the stars into young , intermediate - age and old populations with our chosen cmd boxes .",
    "however , the separation is not perfect .",
    "each bin has significant overlaps with the others due to unavoidable photometric errors and to true overlap in the colors and magnitudes of stellar populations with different ages .",
    "the iac - star cmds have age distributions similar to the match cmds , but with the agb populations weighted more towards older ages and a more significant contamination of old stars in the ms box ( probably due to the relative lack of ms stars in the iac - star models ) .",
    "both effects likely result from the steeper imf assumed for the aparicio cmd . in the following sections of the paper",
    ", we use the match cmd for comparisons with observations because it more closely reproduces the ratio of young ms and heb stars relative to the number of older stars .",
    "we note that these sunthetic cmds assume a _ constant _ star formation rate and thus are not useful in determining true star formation histories .",
    "however , we will be able to use them to get a sense of relative star formation histories ( sfhs ) as a function of scale height and to get a rough sense of the ages of the stars in our cmd regions .",
    "now we compare the surface density profiles of the ms , agb and rgb stars to examine possible variations in stellar population with disk height .",
    "figure  5 shows the completeness - corrected profiles as a function of disk height for each field .",
    "each profile is derived using the same methodology as in  3 , typically using @xmath1610,000 stars per field .",
    "the surface densities are then normalized to have @xmath32 .",
    "all the fields show a similar pattern .",
    "the ms ( blue ) stars have the narrowest distribution while the agb ( red ) and rgb ( orange / yellow ) stars have broader distributions and typically show a dip near the midplane . because we have corrected for incompleteness , the dip almost certainly due to dust absorption , as we demonstrate in  4.4 with a very simple model .",
    "figure  5 suggests that older stellar populations become more prominent with increasing disk height .",
    "we quantify this trend in figure  6 , which shows the ratios of surface densities in our different age bins .",
    "the ratios were normalized to those expected for a constant sfr using the match synthetic cmds ( see  4.1.1 ) .",
    "a ratio of one in fig .",
    "6 therefore corresponds to a constant star formation rate and increasing values correspond to older stellar populations .",
    "we note that the ratio is only plotted where the signal - to - noise of the ratio is greater than 3 .",
    "the small number of ms stars at large scale heights limits our ability to trace the @xmath33/@xmath34 and @xmath35/@xmath34 as high above the midplane as the profiles shown in figures  3 , 5 and 7 .",
    "also , ngc  4631 and ngc  4631-disk are not included in figure  6 because the high completeness limit results in very few rgb stars ( see fig .  1 ) and an increased contamination of agb stars in the rgb box .    the top and middle panels of figure  6 show that in each of the fields , rgb stars become more numerous relative to ms and agb stars with increasing disk height .",
    "however , this trend shows an enormous variation from galaxy to galaxy . in ic  5052",
    "the ratio @xmath33/@xmath34 becomes as high as @xmath16100 times the midplane value , while in ngc  55 and ngc  4244 the increase is much more moderate , to @xmath310 times the midplane value .",
    "this variation is most likely the result of a range of recent sfrs in our galaxies .",
    "the ratio @xmath36/@xmath35 is much more consistent from galaxy - to - galaxy , however .",
    "this may result from the overlapping time range spanned by stars in the agb and rgb boxes and/or the large time ranges these boxes span relative to the ms .",
    "we argue in  5 that the rgb population is likely to be dominated by truly old stars much older than the agb population .",
    "interestingly , the field showing the the flattest @xmath36/@xmath35 profile was the ngc  55-disk field located in the outer parts of the ngc  55 disk , perhaps suggesting a different star formation or dynamical history at large radii ( @xmath37 ) . however , this galaxy is the least inclined in our sample and is somewhat irregular in shape , therefore results for this one system should not be overinterpreted .",
    "the low values of @xmath35/@xmath34 and the high values of @xmath36/@xmath35 result from a lack of agb stars compared to the constant sfr match synthetic cmd .",
    "this would seem to suggest that the galaxies star formation histories ( sfhs ) are depressed at intermediate ages and enhanced at young ages .",
    "however , as we noted in  4.1 , the agb morphologies in the synthetic cmds are not well matched to the observational cmds , probably because of the difficulty in modeling the agb phase of evolution @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy combined with the differences seen between the two sets of synthetic cmds suggests that a derivation of accurate sfhs using just the brightest stars in a galaxy is not yet possible .    to check",
    "if the scatter in the @xmath36/@xmath34 ratio was in part due to varying radial coverages of the galaxies ( table  3 ) , we remade the plots in figure  6 using only stars within the central scale length of each galaxy .",
    "these plots were similar to those shown and showed comparable scatter .",
    "this suggests that the observed variations from galaxy to galaxy in the stellar populations ratio reflect global differences in the galaxies sfhs and/or vertical structure .",
    "for instance , if we assume the trend towards older populations with increasing scale height results from disk heating , then the scatter in figure  6 suggests substantial variations between galaxies in either the mechanisms that heated the disk , or the sfh of the disk . despite these variations , figure  6 gives strong evidence that overall the age of the stellar populations increases with increasing scale height .      to further quantify the differences in the vertical distribution of the three cmd regions , we fit each surface density profile to a sech@xmath38 function in which the normalization , central position , scale height ( @xmath13 ) , and background level were all allowed to vary .",
    "we fit each profile only at disk heights @xmath393@xmath9 to avoid the dips near the midplane , except in ic  5052 and ngc  5023 where we used disk heights @xmath391.5@xmath9 to allow fitting of the very narrow @xmath34 profiles .",
    "figure  7 shows the resulting fits to the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 profile of each galaxy , in the top , middle and bottom panels respectively .",
    "the observed profiles are shown as a solid line , while the best fitting sech@xmath24 function is shown as a dashed line .",
    "the dotted lines at @xmath223@xmath9 ( @xmath221.5@xmath9 in ic  5052 and ngc  5023 ) delineate the region excluded from the fit .",
    "the error bars on the data points are used to weight the sech@xmath24 fits and reflect poisson errors in the number counts , but do not include uncertainties in the completeness corrections .",
    "the scale height of the best - fitting sech@xmath24 function is shown in the upper - left corner of each panel , and the error shown is scaled by the square root of the reduced @xmath40 of the fit .",
    "the reduced @xmath40 values for a majority of the fits were between 0.8 and 1.3 , but were larger for ngc  55 and ngc  4631 due to their irregular structure .",
    "scale heights and errors for all the fits are shown in table  4 .",
    "we find that in each galaxy , the ms scale height value is the narrowest followed by the agb and then the rgb . in all cases",
    "the rgb population is significantly broader than the agb , ms and @xmath2 band @xmath13 values .",
    "this result strongly suggests the presence of an older component with larger scale height .",
    "an analysis of the variations in scale height of the ms , agb and rgb populations with scale length in each of the galaxies turned up no obvious trends .",
    "we also identified no trends with galaxy rotation speed , due to the small range of masses spanned by our sample galaxies .",
    "we note that in some cases , the @xmath13 derived for all stars (  3 ) is somewhat larger than the @xmath13 derived for just the rgb stars .",
    "this results from the lower scale heights used in the fits to the different stellar populations - if the lower limit for the fit to all stars is reduced from 5@xmath9 to 3@xmath9 , the derived @xmath13 is less than or equal to the rgb star @xmath13 in each galaxy , as expected if the total stellar density is well characterized by a combination of the ms , agb and rgb components .",
    "the fits presented here for these different stellar population components are in general not extremely sensitive to the range of @xmath12 values used .",
    "varying the lower limit of the fit between 1.5 - 5@xmath9 typically changed the agb and rgb @xmath13 values by less than 10% .",
    "the compact ms components were more dramatically affected because of the smaller number of stars at large scale heights .    from this analysis",
    "it appears that ngc  4631 has the `` thickest '' old component with an rgb scale height of @xmath161250  pc , roughly 2.5 times larger than the ms and @xmath2 band fits .",
    "we note that the fits for ngc  4631 were truncated at large negative disk heights to prevent the contamination of stars from companion galaxy ngc  4627 .",
    "ic  5052 and ngc  4144 have similar ratios ( @xmath162.5 ) of rgb to ms scale heights , while ngc  4244 has the smallest ratio , with an rgb scale height only 1.7 times that of the ms stars .",
    "there is also evidence for a modest flaring of the stellar components between the central and -disk pointings of ngc  55 and ngc  4631 .",
    "the -disk fields are centered 4.8 and 6.1 scale lengths ( see table  2 ) from the center of the ngc  55 and ngc  4631 respectively .",
    "an increase in @xmath13 values by a factor of 1.1 to 1.6 is seen for all three components in ngc  55 and for the agb and rgb component in ngc  4631 .",
    "the profiles deviate from the fitted sech@xmath24 profile significantly near the midplane .",
    "this deviation is almost certainly due to dust , we model this effect in  4.4 . at larger disk heights ( @xmath392 - 3  kpc )",
    "there is also a slight overdensity in the rgb components of ic  5052 , ngc  4144 , ngc  4244 and ngc  5023 .",
    "these overdensities hint at the possible presence of an even more broadly distributed old component . in three of these galaxies ,",
    "the rgb fits had elevated @xmath40 values relative to the ms and agb fits .",
    "we estimate that these overdensities occur at a surface brightness @xmath41 28 mag arcsec@xmath42 assuming a luminosity function similar to galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "however , without better knowledge of the background level , it is not possible to verify the existence of this component .",
    "the scale heights measured in the @xmath2 band ( table  4 ) are closest to those measured for the ms and agb components .",
    "half of the galaxies have @xmath2 band scale heights closer to the ms value and the other half closer to the agb value .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath2 band light in these galaxies is dominated by relatively young stellar populations , probably red supergiants and agb stars ( in agreement with the findings of * ? ? ?",
    "this result runs contrary to the common assumption that the nir light primarily traces older stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is significant in that nir luminosity is often used as a proxy for stellar mass when comparing galaxies of different types and masses .",
    "however , we note that our @xmath2 band scale heights are biased towards higher surface brightness populations due to the bright limiting isophote of the 2mass data from which they are derived .",
    "the results above indicate that there is a systematic increase in the vertical scale heights of older stellar populations in our sample of low mass , late - type disks . before investigating possible origins for these structural differences in  [ diskheatingsec ]  &   [ metallicitysec ] ,",
    "we now compare our measurements of scale heights to previous observations of the vertical structure of disks .",
    "the most detailed constraints on the scale heights of different stellar populations come from the solar circle of the milky way .",
    "studies have revealed a complicated disk structure , with a young and old thin disk embedded within a more extended thick disk .",
    "the young thin disk is the narrowest of the three , having a scale height of z@xmath43  pc , as traced by stars with bright absolute magnitudes ( @xmath44 ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the scale heights of the young main sequence stars in our sample are almost all significantly larger than the milky way value suggesting that the low mass galaxies in our sample form stars in a thicker layer than the milky way , consistent with @xcite . the resulting axial ratios for our samples young star forming disks are also much thicker as well , with @xmath45 ( see table  4 ) for our sample galaxies , versus @xmath46 for the young thin disk of the milky way .",
    "the division of the milky way s older stellar populations into a thin and thick disk was first introduced by @xcite to explain a break in the number counts of f & g stars at @xmath47  kpc . while the need for two old disk components was long debated , recent measurements of systematic @xmath48-element enhancement in thick disk stars ( most recently * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) strongly suggest that the thick disk is indeed distinct from the old thin disk .",
    "recent observations @xcite give a scale height for the old thin disk of z@xmath49  pc , similar to found in the original @xcite study .",
    "these same studies suggest that the exponential scale height of the thick disk is @xmath50  pc ( corresponding to z@xmath51  pc , thinner than originally claimed ) . the milky way thick disk is therefore roughly twice the height of the old thin disk , and 7 times the height of the young thin disk .    within our own sample ,",
    "the scale height of the old rgb component is mostly intermediate between the milky way old thin disk and the thick disk .",
    "our sample galaxies have much lower masses and surface densities than the milky way , and , lacking any firm model that predicts how the properties of the old thin disk and the thick disk should vary with galaxy mass , we are hesistant to attribute the extraplanar population to either an old thin or a thick disk on the basis of the the surface brightness profiles alone .",
    "there are no dramatic inflection points in the rgb surface density profiles plotted in figure  7 that would assist in a unique separation of old thin disk and thick disk stars , and the possible overdensity of stars above 2 - 3  kpc may well be due to a stellar halo . even if the rgb component is similar to the milky way thick disk , this lack of inflection is not unexpected . in the milky way ,",
    "the inflection point in the surface density of f & g dwarves that marks the separation of the thin and thick disks is likely the result of two different populations of stars separated in age .",
    "the lack of similar inflection points in our rgb profiles can easily be explained if the rgb stars do nt have as wide a range of ages as the milky way dwarves .",
    "we will show in  5 that the rgb stars in our galaxies may very well be dominated by a single - age population .",
    "we do note , however , that the axial ratios of the rgb disks range between @xmath52 , with a median of 1.8 ( adopting the @xmath2-band radial scale length , and averaging the two independent measurements for ngc  55 and ngc  4631 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the axial ratios of the old thin and the thick disks of the milky way are 5.0 and 2.1 , respectively ( assuming @xmath53  kpc for both components ) .",
    "thus , in terms of their _ overall _ structure , the rgb component we detect is significantly more round than the milky way s old thin disk , and is distributed more like the milky way thick disk .",
    "however , without additional information we can not ascribe a common formation scenario to our observed rgb component and the milky way thick disk .",
    "we revisit this issue in the discussion (  [ discussionsec ] ) , after analyzing the disk heating and the vertical metallicity gradients of our sample galaxies .    outside of the milky way",
    ", the most detailed information comes from studies of the vertical distribution of resolved stars in hst images , similar to the work we present in this paper .",
    "@xcite and @xcite present evidence for extended components in six galaxies , which they qualitatively argue correspond to thick disks and halos . of the galaxies that overlap our sample ( ngc  55 , ngc  4144 , and ngc  4244 ) , they include archival wfpc2 observations to reach greater disk heights in ngc  4244 and ngc  55 than spanned by our acs images . in both cases",
    "they assume _ a priori _ that the rgb stars at lower disk heights trace a thick disk . for ngc  4244 , @xcite show an exponential distribution of rgb stars between @xmath161 and @xmath54  kpc ( their figure  8) that appears to roughly match the scale height of the profile shown in fig .  7 .",
    "beyond @xmath54  kpc , they see a flattening in the number counts which they claim is a halo , but which may also be the background level . for ngc  55 , @xcite plot an exponential distribution of rgb stars between 2 and @xmath55  kpc ",
    "i.e. at much greater disk heights than probed by our data",
    ". however , based on inspection of their figure  12 , the extended rgb component has a z@xmath56 value of @xmath57  kpc , which is 2 - 3 times the width of the rgb component we fit .",
    "although they assume this component is due to a thick disk based on its exponential surface density distribution , the axial ratio of this component would in fact be prolate ( @xmath58 ) and thus may be more analogous to the milky way s stellar halo .",
    "the change in slope also implies a break in the rgb distribution in ngc  55 at around @xmath59  kpc . by analogy , this may indicate that the marginal overdensities we are seeing at comparably large disk heights in our rgb profiles might be the signature of an additional broader halo component .",
    "@xcite also finds the presence of old stars at large scale heights , and while these stars are automatically assumed to be a thick disk component , no detailed analysis of their spatial distribution is presented .",
    "in addition to these recent studies of resolved stars , most previous studies of the vertical structure of disks have focused on detecting thick disks and stellar halos using unresolved surface brightness profiles of the galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because we only detect stars at bright magnitudes , it is difficult to accurately convert our measured surface density of stars ( figure  2 ) to a surface brightness",
    "however , assuming the outer parts of our galaxies have luminosity functions similar to galactic globular clusters @xcite , we estimate that we reach f606w surface brightnesses of @xmath1628 mag arcsec@xmath42 .",
    "this is comparable to the depth reached in deep ground - based observations",
    ".    only one of our galaxies has been analyzed for vertically extended components using ground based data . @xcite",
    "present @xmath60-band surface photometry of ngc  4244 and find no evidence of a second thick disk component , based on the lack of an inflection point in the surface brightness distribution above the plane .",
    "they trace the vertical profile of ngc  4244 along the minor axis to @xmath57  kpc at which point it falls below their surface brightness limit of 27.5 mag arcsec@xmath42 .",
    "we trace the rgb component out to nearly @xmath54  kpc , and find a scale height that is similar to their fitted @xmath60-band scale height ( assuming @xmath14=@xmath61z@xmath56 ) .",
    "their lack of an inflection in the surface brightness profile is consistent with the @xcite analysis to larger scale heights .",
    "this suggests that their fit was dominated by the old stars , and not a younger population .",
    "however , the lack of an inflection in the surface density distribution does not unambiguously rule out the presence of multiple components .",
    "the ubiquity of thick disks in galaxies has previously been proposed by @xcite based on color - gradients in edge - on disk galaxies .",
    "our observations confirm that the color - gradients ( at least at the low - mass end ) are the result of true differences in stellar populations . however , whether these gradients have an analagous formation mechanism to the milky way thick disk is not clear .",
    "one set of observations that reaches considerably deeper than these ground - based observations is presented by @xcite , who used stacked sloan images to show that halos are common in late - type , edge - on galaxies .",
    "their composite galaxy has a significantly wider field of view and poorer resolution than our observations .",
    "they show that the best - fitting model to their data is a disk+halo model , with the disk component dominating out to roughly 10 exponential scale heights ( @xmath1610z@xmath62 ) . their limited resolution and combination of a heterogenous sample of galaxies",
    "would likely prevent them from seeing the rgb components we see in our galaxies",
    ". however , the possible detection of the more extended rgb components detected in ic  5052 , ngc  4144 , and ngc  5023 may be halos similar to the @xcite halo .",
    "the increase in @xmath13 seen in each galaxy between the ms , agb and rgb populations ( fig .  7 ,",
    "table  4 ) could result from a number of mechanisms , including vertical heating of a thin disk .",
    "such a model would naturally produce the observed trend of older stellar populations having larger scale heights .",
    "in figure  8 we plot the increase in scale height with mean stellar age for four fields that span the observed behaviour in our sample .",
    "we plot scale heights for the rgb and agb , normalized by the ms scale heights , with the height of the symbols indicating the 1@xmath63 uncertainties on @xmath13 .",
    "note that when interpreting our data in the context of disk heating models we are therefore implicitly assuming that the rgb and agb stars were originally formed in a layer with a scale height comparable to that of the present day main sequence stars .",
    "we assign characteristic ages to the rgb and agb using the match synthetic cmd tests for a constant sfr (  4.1.1 ) .",
    "however , because the galaxies actual star formation histories may differ significantly from the constant sfr assumed in figure  4 , we can not assign a single age to each stellar population .",
    "instead , we use the resulting age distributions to identify the 25th , 50th ( median ) and 75th percentile ages .",
    "the resulting age ranges are shown by the width of the individual boxes in figure  8 .",
    "however , note that the actual age of the population may lie entirely outside of the boxes , for example , if the rgb stars were all formed in a single burst 12  gyr ago .",
    "thus , when interpeting figure  8 , one has substantial allowance in assigning an age .    overplotted on figure  8 are dashed lines showing a range of power - law increases in the disk scale height @xmath13 with time ( @xmath64 ) . for an isothermal sech@xmath24 profile ,",
    "the @xmath13 values are related to the vertical velocity dispersion ( @xmath65 ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the surface density of the disk ( eq .",
    "17 in * ? ? ?",
    "studies of disk heating traditionally use power laws in the velocity dispersion , @xmath68 , and thus @xmath69 .",
    "figure  8 therefore demonstrates that the vertical velocity dispersion of our galaxies has increased no faster than @xmath70 .",
    "more specifically , there are no characteristic ages that can be assigned to the agb and rgb stars that yield heating rates greater than @xmath70 ( with the possible exception of the more massive , interacting galaxy ngc  4631 ) , and thus this conclusion is robust even in light of our substantial age uncertainties .    in contrast , the disk heating that has been observed in the milky way is comparatively rapid . the age - velocity dispersion relation ( avr ) for milky way disk stars suggests that the vertical velocity dispersion increases with time with values of @xmath48 ranging between 0.3 and 0.6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see summary in table 1 of hanninen & flynn 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , our limit of @xmath71 is significantly smaller than the milky way value .",
    "these data immediately suggest that any disk heating in our low mass galaxies has been far less effective than in the milky way . moreover , if some fraction of the extraplanar rgb stars are not due to disk heating , and are instead due to direct accretion or _ in situ _ formation at large scale heights , or if the rgb stars are weighted towards old ages ( as we argue below in  5 ) , then the actual rate of disk heating is even lower than suggested by figure  8 .",
    "there are several reasons why disk heating is expected to be low for our sample galaxies . within the milky way",
    ", the increase in vertical velocity dispersion with time is thought to be due to scattering by spiral arms @xcite , by molecular clouds @xcite , or both ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the review by lacey 1991 ) .",
    "however , our galaxies have sufficiently low masses and surface densities that they are unlikely to be globally gravitationally unstable @xcite and thus would not host strong spiral arms . given that scattering by spiral arms seems to be the dominant heating mechanism in the milky way ( e.g. most recently * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the absence of spiral arms alone should cause a drastic drop in heating rate down to @xmath72 , the expected value for heating by giant molecular clouds alone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "likewise , the absence of strong dust lanes in these systems and the results of  [ dustmodelsec ] both indicate that the cold molecular ism is in a thicker layer than in the milky way .",
    "this large scale height for the cold ism , and the general lack of molecular gas in low mass galaxies @xcite should therefore further suppress the efficiency of disk heating .",
    "finally , the young stellar disks in our sample are apparently much thicker than in the milky way , which could reduce the efficiency of any heating mechanism @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argue for reduced disk heating in late - type galaxies based on the ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersions .",
    "however , their rationale for the observed trend is opposite from what we conclude from our data .    as an aside",
    ", the low observed heating rates may provide strong constraints on cosmologically important sources of disk heating including late - time satellite accretion @xcite , massive black holes @xcite , or halo substructure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the expected heating rates for such models have been calibrated for massive spiral disks , not the thicker , lower surface density galaxies studied here .      before continuing to explore the origin of extraplanar stars",
    ", we briefly examine the vertical distribution of the dust layer . at first glance ,",
    "interpretation of the stellar density profiles near the midplane in figure  5 might be somewhat confusing .",
    "if the dips in surface density are due to dust , why does the dust appear to affect the rgb and agb stars more than the ms stars ?",
    "we suggest this may occur because the dust layer is opaque near the midplane and is distributed with a scale height greater than or equal to the ms population , but less than the agb / rgb populations .",
    "the ms stars we are seeing would then lie entirely in front of an obscuring dust screen , while the agb / rgb populations would have a significant population at large disk heights above where the galaxy becomes optically thin .",
    "the dip in their numbers near the midplane is then explained because the optically thick dust layer obscures some fraction of the stars along the line of sight .    to test this explanation",
    ", we built a simple toy model galaxy with ms , rgb and agb populations distributed as sech@xmath24 profiles with the @xmath73 as shown in table  4 .",
    "all components were given identical radial distributions with the @xmath2 band exponential scale length .",
    "the dust component was assumed to also follow a sech@xmath24 profile with a variable scale height , @xmath74 , and a radial distribution identical to that of the stars . for simplicity we assumed that the dust has no effect at an optical depth less than one , but is completely obscuring at greater optical depths .",
    "thus , along a line of sight , the dust is completely transparent to @xmath75 , and completely opaque beyond . for each vertical position we integrated the dust component along the line - of - sight until an optical depth of one",
    "was reached , which set the depth of the dust screen at that height .",
    "stellar density profiles for the three separate populations were then created by totaling the number of stars in front of the dust screen at each height .",
    "we then normalized the stellar density profiles as in figure  5 .",
    "figure  9 shows the resulting model of ngc  4144 for three values of @xmath74 presented for comparison to the observations shown in figure  5 . in each case",
    "the amount of dust in the midplane is the same .",
    "the underlying values for @xmath13 were adopted from table  4 ( 374 , 699 , and 934 pc for the ms , agb and rgb respectively ) .",
    "the left panel shows the results for a dust layer whose scale height is narrower than all three stellar components . for this case",
    ", there is a pronounced dip in the surface density profile of all three components . in the middle panel ,",
    "the value of @xmath74 is between the @xmath13 values for the ms and the agb / rgb populations . in this case",
    "there is a dip only in the agb / rgb , because the height of the ms layer is entirely confined within the opaque dust layer , allowing only the unobscured stars on the near side of the galaxy to be detected .",
    "the right panel has a dust layer larger than the both the ms and agb value and therefore a dip is seen only in the rgb component .",
    "the middle panel does a good job of qualitatively matching the observations for ngc  4144 in figure  5 .    referring back to figure  5",
    ", we can see that the main sequence profile lacks a dip near the midplane for most of the fields , while the rgb has a dip in all cases within 2 - 3  @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests that the dust in the galaxy is opaque below 2 - 3  @xmath9 and that it is distributed in a layer with thickness greater than or equal to the ms stars .",
    "because the ms stars are already distributed in a thicker distribution than in the milky way , this result supports the @xcite finding that galaxies with circular velocities below 120 km  s@xmath1 have large dust scale heights and do not form thin dust lanes .",
    "all of the galaxies presented here except ngc  4631 are below this circular velocity limit ( table  1 ) .",
    "this model also suggests that although the depth to which we see in each galaxy is different at differing scale heights , it is the same for all the stellar populations at a single scale height .",
    "this validates the comparisons made in fig .  6 between the ages of the stellar populations at different scale heights .",
    "although this model matches the gross characteristics of many of the profiles shown in fig .  5 , it fails to fully explain their details .",
    "most notably , in ngc  55 and ngc  4244 , the ms profiles are significantly lower than the best - fitting sech@xmath24 function , contradicting the idea that all the stars we are seeing lie in front of a screen .",
    "this is likely the result of our model s lack of sophistication .",
    "physically , it does nt take into account the possibility of flares or changing scale lengths as a function of stellar population .",
    "in addition , it treats dust extinction in a very simplistic fashion . a more sophisticated treatment of the dust ( such as the one presented by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the conclusions reached in this section should be considered tentative and will be tested in a later paper , in which we will present a more realistic dust model .",
    "as has been shown previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the color of the red giant branch near its tip can be used to constrain the metallicity of old stellar populations . although reddening due to dust will prevent an accurate measurement of the metallicity of stars near the midplane",
    ", we can determine a rough metallicity for stars above the midplane where the effect of dust and the contamination from agb stars are small ( as shown in figure  6 , middle panel ) .",
    "figure  10 shows a composite cmd of all high - latitude stars ( above 4@xmath9 ) in ic  5052 , ngc  55 , ngc  55-disk , ngc  4144 , ngc  4244 , and ngc  5023 .",
    "this disk height limit was chosen ( 1 ) to be well above any of the dips associated with dust in figure  5 , ( 2 ) to dramatically reduce contamination by agb and heb stars that might interfere in the metallicity determination , and ( 3 ) to be where thick disk stars dominate in the milky way @xcite .",
    "overlayed on the cmd are 10 gyr old rgb isochrones @xcite at metallicities ranging from [ fe / h ] @xmath76 to 0.0 , with higher metallicities being redder .",
    "examination of figure  10 shows that the peak of the distribution falls between the [ fe / h ] @xmath77 and -0.7 lines .",
    "roughly 13% of the stars fall bluewards of the [ fe / h ] @xmath76 isochrone , probably due to a combination of photometric error and the presence of agb stars .",
    "very few are redder than the [ fe / h ] @xmath78 isochrone .",
    "overall , figure  10 indicates that most of the stars above 4@xmath9 are moderately metal - poor .",
    "improving on the metallicity determinations in paper  i , here we will derive metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) using untransformed magnitudes and padova isochrones @xcite . to determine metallicity distribution functions for individual galaxies we binned the stars in up to three independent 0.2 magnitude wide bins centered on m@xmath79 of -3.5 , -3.3 , and -3.1 .",
    "these are shown with dashed lines in figure  10 .",
    "the brightest bin was chosen to include stars as metal - rich as [ fe / h ] @xmath78 , which do not get brighter than m@xmath79 of -3.7 .",
    "we considered only the magnitude bins that were above the 20% completeness cutoff for crowded regions ( thus excluding the fainter bins in ngc  4144 , see figure  1 ) .",
    "this cut eliminated ngc  4631 and ngc  4631-disk from the analysis , because none of the bins fell above their 20% completeness limits .",
    "we corrected the colors and magnitudes of each star for foreground reddening , but made no correction for completeness , since the change in completeness across the color - range in question is similar to the error that would be introduced by that correction .",
    "we then determined the metallicity of each star by linearly interpolating between the 10 gyr isochrones in each bin .",
    "since some of the stars bluewards of the [ fe / h ] @xmath76 isochrone may be rgb stars scattered to bluer colors by photometric error , we attempted to include these stars in the mdfs . in each bin ,",
    "stars bluer than the [ fe / h ] @xmath76 isochrone were given positive color shifts by multiplying a gaussian random number by their error .",
    "this correction moved @xmath8050% of these stars redwards of the [ fe / h ] @xmath76 isochrone , and resulted in a slight increase ( @xmath160.01 in the normalized units ) in the mdf between a [ fe / h ] of -1.3 and -2.3 .",

    ", we note that there are several uncertainties in the detailed shapes of the metallicity distribution functions .",
    "first , they are based on isochrone models and not empirical data ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "second , the color errors on the metal - poor end ( table  5 ) translate into a large error in metallicity .",
    "we estimated the errors as a function of metallicity by inserting stars of a specific metallicity / color , giving them appropriate color errors , and then determining the spread in the resulting metallicity distribution .",
    "this procedure gave errors of 0.5 - 0.8 dex at [ fe / h ] @xmath76 .",
    "however , the shape of the distributions are much more believable on the metal - rich end where the isochrones are well separated , giving errors of less than 0.1 dex at [ fe / h ] @xmath78 . at the peak of the mdf ( [ fe / h ] @xmath16 -0.9 ) , typical errors are 0.2 dex , suggesting that the peak metallicities derived here are fairly reliable .    comparing the peak metallicity of the extraplanar stars to known milky way populations , figure  11 indicates that the metallicities of the extraplanar stars are a factor of ten times too high to be analogs of the milky way s stellar halo ( @xmath81 } \\sim-1.7 $ ] ,",
    "this result would not change even if all the stars bluewards of the [ fe / h ] @xmath76 isochrone are low metallicity rgb stars .",
    "we note however , that the low metallicity of the milky way halo may not be typical .",
    "the halo of andromeda has been found to be much more metal - rich than in the milky way , with a peak [ fe / h ] @xmath16 -0.6 @xcite , although there is difficulty ascribing these outer stars to a halo population _",
    "per se _ , given m31 s complicated outer structure @xcite .",
    "of all the milky way components , we find that the peak metallicities are most consistent with those of the metallicity of the milky way thick disk , which has [ fe / h ] @xmath16 -0.8 based on f / g dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the extraplanar stars studied here are somewhat more metal poor than the milky way s thick disk ( by up to 0.3 dex ) .",
    "however , this offset may not be surprising given the lower mass of our galaxy sample ( @xmath82 km  s@xmath1 vs @xmath83 km  s@xmath1 for the milky way ) .",
    "as in the milky way @xcite , the metallicities of the extraplanar stars appear to be more metal poor than the thin , young , main sequence population .",
    "although dust prevents us from reliably measuring the metallicity of stars near the midplane , we can estimate their metallicity using the current gas phase metallicity .",
    "ngc 55 , the only galaxy in our sample with a gas phase abundance measurement , has @xmath84 at one disk scale length @xcite .",
    "this metallicity corresponds to [ fe / h ] @xmath85 ( assuming [ fe / o ] @xmath86 ) , which is 0.5 dex more metal rich than the extraplanar stars at a comparable radius .",
    "other late - type disks with similar rotational velocities from the @xcite compilation have comparable gas - phase metallicities , suggesting that the offset in metallicity between the midplane and the extraplanar populations is likely to be systematic .",
    "although they do not explicitly examine stars as a function of scale height , studies of metallicities in other galaxies using methods similar to ours also find broad agreement with the presence of an extended [ fe / h ] @xmath87 population of rgb stars .",
    "the lmc ( which has a mass similar to the galaxies in our sample ) has a peak metallicity distribution of [ fe / h ] @xmath88 for rgb stars in the disk @xcite .",
    "recent papers on the outer regions of m33 also find peak [ fe / h ] values of -1.0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent paper by @xcite , derives a [ fe / h ] of roughly -1 for ngc  55 using near - ir photometry of resolved extraplanar stars , closely matching our peak metallicity in figure  11 .",
    "our data and others therefore suggest the pervasive presence of a significant [ fe / h ] @xmath87 old population in late - type galaxies .",
    "if our association of this population with a thicker disk is generally true in other galaxies , then it presents an attractive solution to the `` g - dwarf '' problem seen in the milky way by providing the necessary prompt initial enrichment for stars in the thin disk @xcite .",
    "overplotted on figure  11 as dashed lines are the expected metallicity distributions for closed - box `` simple '' chemical evolution models ( eq .",
    "20 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) scaled to the peaks of the mdfs .",
    "while the basic shape of these models are similar to our mdfs , there appears to be a deficit in some galaxies of stars at both low and high metallicities .",
    "a deficit at high metallicities is expected if star formation truncates before all the gas is consumed . within the context of thick disk formation models ,",
    "this truncation may occur if some of the gas reservoir that forms the extraplanar stars instead settles into the thin disk , if the extraplanar stars were heated from a previously thin but gas - rich disk , or if the extraplanar stars were directly accreted from merging satellites that suffered from tidal stripping or supernova blowout .",
    "the apparent deficit of stars at low metallicities may be another manifestation of the widespread g - dwarf problem .",
    "thus , while the existence of a substantial population of stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath87 may help to solve the g - dwarf problem in the thin disk , it may have simply pushed the problem into a new component .",
    "the solution to the extraplanar g - dwarf problem will likely lie among the suite of popular models previously explored for the thin disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , some of the deficit of stars at low metallicities may also result from the photometric errors and methods used to construct the mdfs , as discussed above .",
    "finally , we note that the peaks of the metallicity distribution functions given in table  5 are significantly more metal - rich than our previous determination presented in paper  i. rather than using native f606w@xmath89f814w colors , these earlier measurements applied the metallicity - color relation of @xcite to the mean color of the giant branch transformed to the johnson - cousins filter system .",
    "these previous values , reproduced in table  5 , range from [ fe / h ] of -1.2 to -1.7 , versus -0.7 to -1.1 in the present work .",
    "we believe that in addition to the magnitude transformation , the difference in derived metallicity results in part from the difference in binning ( in [ fe / h ] vs.  f606w - f814w ) , such that the mean color does not correspond to the peak metallicity .",
    "this offset can be seen in the 0.1 - 0.2 dex offset between the mean and peak metallicity in table  5 .",
    "furthermore , the paper  i determination also included stars at somewhat lower disk heights , thereby increasing the number of agb contaminants .",
    "we believe that the mdfs and their peak metallicity that we present here are more reliable than the estimate given in paper  i.      models for the origin of extraplanar stars ( i.e.  disk heating , direct accretion , etc . )",
    "predict different degrees of variation in the stellar metallicity with height above the plane . to investigate the vertical variation of metallicity with disk height @xmath12 we have examined the median color of the rgb stars as a function of the height above the midplane .",
    "figure  12 shows the median color of rgb stars between m@xmath79 of -3.2 and -3.6 and redwards of f606w - f814w=0.7 , binned by the scale height of the galaxies .",
    "data are plotted where errors in the median color are @xmath900.05 magnitudes .",
    "the hatched region at low disk heights shows where the effects of internal reddening may impact the colors of the stars .",
    "for the three fields with profiles extending beyond 2 - 3  kpc we bin the rgb stars at large disk heights in a single bin to reach adequate signal - to - noise in our measurement of the median color , plotted as diamonds in figure  12 . we note that these are the same stars that comprise the possible extended components discussed in  4.2 .",
    "figure  12 demonstrates three main points .",
    "first , the color gradients in the galaxies are relatively small , indicating that the stars have nearly uniform metallicity with increasing distance above the plane , particularly at scale heights above the region potentially affected by dust . however , we note that the stars at very large radii ( shown with diamonds ) do tend towards bluer colors , possibly indicating the presence of a more metal - poor population at @xmath91 ( 2 - 3 kpc ) .",
    "second , the color gradients show no systematic trends , and are equally likely to be rising or falling . finally , all the galaxies have very similar rgb colors ( as demonstrated already in figure  11 ) .",
    "our metallicity gradient results are consistent with previous observations of these and other low - mass spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite used hst archival data to study the vertical properties of disks in four low - luminosity ( @xmath92 ) edge - on galaxies comparable to those studied here . using agb , rgb , and red supergiant stars over a large range of magnitudes ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "he calculates the mean colors up to 2 kpc from the plane .",
    "his main results are that there are slight or no color gradients as a function of disk height and that the metallicities of the stars at disk heights between 400 and 2000 pc are between -0.8 and -1.0 in all four galaxies , in excellent agreement with what we find here .",
    "@xcite also state that any metallicity gradient in ngc  55 is very small , in agreement with our observed lack of color - gradients in figure  12 .",
    "recent simulations of thick disks by @xcite also show a lack of any metallicity gradient with disk height .",
    "the lack of strong metallicity gradients can be explained in a number of ways .",
    "@xcite suggests the lack of metallicity gradients rules out dissipative and simple accretion models for thick disk formation , and favors a model in which thick disks form during interactions .",
    "we note that the lack of metallicity gradient may also be enhanced by an `` age - bias '' in the metallicity measurements . the mass of stars on the rgb changes from @xmath162 m@xmath30 at an age of 1 gyr to @xmath901 m@xmath30 at 10 gyr .",
    "given the steepness of the imf in this mass range , the rgb age distribution will be weighted towards older ages , and therefore to a more uniform metallicity . however , based on the constant star formation rate models in  4.1 , it still appears that the rgb stars could span a wide range of ages , even in the presence of the expected age - bias .",
    "therefore , the simplest interpretation of the lack of gradients in our data is that many of the rgb stars at disk heights above 4@xmath9 ( @xmath161 kpc ) formed at a similar time and thus have comparable enrichment histories , eliminating any metallicity gradient .",
    "this scenario could be explained either by a sudden heating of the disk by interaction , or by accretion of gas - rich satellites which resulted in the formation of a thick component .",
    "n - body simulations have shown that early merging and accretion events can produce thick disks with old ages @xcite .",
    "the work presented here has identified a number of main observational results :    * in low mass , late - type galaxies the thickness of a stellar population increases systematically with the age of the stars being studied .",
    "this behavior has been seen not just in all six of the galaxies studied here , but in all other hst studies of edge - on late - type galaxies , and in the milky way as well .",
    "the larger scale heights of older stellar populations is therefore likely to be a generic property of galaxy disks . * all of the studied galaxies",
    "show a clear intermediate age ( @xmath94  gyr old ) population whose scale height is intermediate between that of the young main sequence stars and the older red giants . *",
    "the metallicity of the dominant old stellar population has [ fe / h ] @xmath95 , but shows little or no gradient between @xmath96 and @xmath97 above the plane . above this height ( @xmath98  kpc )",
    ", there are tentative indications of decreasing metallicities , which may be associated with slight overdensities in the rgb surface density at similar distances above the midplane .",
    "* in the low mass galaxies studied here",
    "( @xmath99  km  sec@xmath1 ) , the young stellar population is systematically thicker than in the mw , and has a vertical scale height comparable to the thickness of the dust layer .",
    "this suggests that the cold ism has a larger scale height in low mass galaxies , consistent with the lack of dust lanes observed in such systems @xcite .",
    "* the young and intermediate - age stellar populations dominate the integrated _ near - infrared _ light of late - type low mass galaxies .",
    "we now interpret these observational facts in the context of disk formation models .",
    "first , taken at face value , the old rgb component s @xmath163:1 axial ratio and [ fe / h ] @xmath95 metallicity suggest a close correspondence with the milky way s thick disk",
    ". however , each of our galaxies scale heights steadily increase from the young main sequence to the intermediate age agb and the older rgb .",
    "the uniformity of this trend strongly suggests that our disks are not simply the superposition of two components ( i.e.  a thick and thin disk ) . instead",
    ", the data require a more complex model incorporating some disk heating to explain the systematically larger scale height of the intermediate - age population .",
    "the necessary disk heating would also have affected any older population , and thus must make some contribution to the thicker population of rgb stars .",
    "the required amount of disk heating is much smaller than is seen in the milky way (  4.3 ) , and could likely be provided by molecular clouds or minor mergers .",
    "the latter scenario is slightly favored by the large variations in the apparent change of disk scale height with time ( figures  6  &  8) .",
    "heating through satellite accretion and interaction could naturally produce these stochastic variations .",
    "however , numerical simulations of heating in diffuse low mass disks would be required to definitively constrain any of the above scenarios and to assess how significant a contribution heating may have made to the thicker rgb component .",
    "while the above argument strongly suggests that disk heating must play some role in the production of the extraplanar stars , the lack of a metallicity gradient in rgb stars at moderate disk heights ( @xmath100  pc , as shown here and in mould 2005 ) suggests that steady disk heating can not entirely explain the thickest component of old rgb stars .",
    "if the past star formation rate has been constant , then there is a significant overlap between the stellar ages of the agb and rgb regions of the color - magnitude diagram ( figure  4 ) .",
    "a significant fraction of the rgb stars should therefore have smaller scale heights , younger ages , and enriched metallicities , and would thus produce a steady increase in metallicity towards the midplane for all but the most contrived scenarios .",
    "the most attractive explanation for the lack of metallicity gradient is that instead of a constant star formation rate , the majority of rgb stars at all scale heights must have formed early and with a well - mixed metallicity distribution .",
    "such a population would dwarf any subsequent population of enriched rgb stars with lower scale heights .",
    "while steady dynamical heating could push this ancient population to larger scale heights , it could not simultaneously account for recent dynamical observations of counter - rotating disks at these disk heights in comparable galaxies @xcite . taken together ,",
    "these observations are better explained by scenarios involving the formation of a thick disk of stars in merger events ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "overall , our results require that some disk heating occurs at intermediate ages ( to puff up the agb component ) , but that events at earlier times ( interactions or mergers ) created a majority of the rgb stars over a short timescale",
    ".    finally , we present tenuous evidence for an extended old component seen only at disk heights @xmath39 2 - 3 kpc . at large scale heights we see marginal overdensities of stars in the rgb profiles of fig .  7 .",
    "there also seems to be a reduction in the metallicity of rgb stars at this height ( fig .",
    "12 ) . in one of our galaxies",
    ", @xcite finds strong evidence for a very extended component of rgb stars extending from @xmath162 - 7  kpc .",
    "while this component appears to have an exponential distribution , its z@xmath56 value of @xmath162 kpc ( compared to a radial scale length of @xmath161 kpc ) strongly suggests it is not a disk .",
    "these extended components are detected at about the same height where the halo becomes prominent in the stacked sloan images of @xcite .",
    "however , based on our observations , we are unable to assess the properties or frequency of these components .",
    "the present - day structure of galaxy disks results from a complex mixing of effects and a full explanation requires detailed knowledge of the the star formation history , merging events , and disk heating .",
    "studies like the one presented here help to disentangle these effects and determine their relative importance as function of galaxy type and mass .",
    "this study also shows the promise that hst observations of resolved stars have for enabling the detailed analysis of low surface brightness stellar components in galaxies outside the local group . a comparison of our data with n - body simulations of low mass disk galaxies would assist in constraining disk heating and merging scenarios",
    "unfortunately , current simulations of disk galaxy formation have focused on massive galaxies like the milky way @xcite . also ,",
