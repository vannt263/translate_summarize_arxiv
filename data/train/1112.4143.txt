    "in the late seventies , feigenbaum ( @xcite ) and coullet and treser ( @xcite ) proposed at the same time the renormalization operator to explain the universal features observed in the cascade of period doubling bifurcations of the logistic map .",
    "this explanation was based on the existence of a hyperbolic fixed point of the operator with suitable properties .",
    "the first proof of the existence of this point and his hyperbolicity were obtained with numeric assistance @xcite . in @xcite",
    "sullivan generalized the operator and provided a theoretical proof of the hyperbolicity using complex dynamics . in @xcite a nice summary of the one dimensional renormalization theory can be found , up to the date of their respective publication , as well as contributions to this theory .",
    "the kind of maps that we consider are maps in the cylinder where the dynamics on the periodic variable is given by a rigid rotation and the dynamics on the other variable is given by an unimodal one dimensional map plus a small perturbation which depends on both variables .",
    "these maps are known as quasi - periodically forced one dimensional maps and they have been extensively studied ( @xcite ) with a focus on the existence of strange non - chaotic attractors .",
    "the paradigmatic example in our case of study is the forced logistic map , which is the map on the cylinder @xmath9 defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are parameters and @xmath12 is a fixed diophantine number ( typically it will be the golden mean ) .",
    "this family has interest not only for phenomena related with the existence of strange non - chaotic attractors ( @xcite ) but also as a toy - model for the truncation of period doubling bifurcation cascade ( @xcite ) .",
    "the term `` truncation of the period doubling bifurcation cascade '' refers to the fact that , when one fixes @xmath13 and let @xmath14 grow , the attracting set of the map undergoes only a finite number of period doubling bifurcations before exhibiting a chaotic behavior .",
    "this differs from the one dimensional case , where the number of period doubling bifurcations before chaos is infinite .    in @xcite",
    "we studied the truncation of the period doubling cascade for the map ( [ flm ] ) .",
    "we observed that the reducibility of the attracting set plays a crucial role .",
    "we computed bifurcation diagrams in terms of the dynamics of the attracting set , taking into account different properties , as the lyapunov exponent and , in the case of having a periodic invariant curve , its period and its reducibility .",

    "figure [ table coding diagrams ] also reveals that from every parameter value @xmath20 two curves of reducibility loss are born .",
    "these curves correspond to a reducibility - loss and `` reducibility - recovery '' bifurcations of the @xmath1-periodic invariant curve . in @xcite",
    "we prove , under suitable hypothesis , that these curves exist . in figure [ table coding diagrams ] we can observe that the period doubling bifurcation curve born around @xmath21 is confined by one of the reducibility loss bifurcation curves born around @xmath22 and another one born around @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we approximate numerically slopes of the reducibility loss bifurcations curves described above and use them to explore for the existence of universality and self - similarity properties within the quasi - periodic one dimensional maps .",
    "a posteriori we know that the self - similarity properties exists between the bifurcation diagrams of the map ( [ flm ] ) for different values of @xmath12 . for a better presentation of the concept ,",
    "let us start the discussion looking for self - similarity withing the bifurcation diagram of the map ( [ flm ] ) with @xmath12 fixed .",
    "consider the sequence of values @xmath0 for which the logistic map has a superstable periodic orbit as before . in figure [ flm parameter space ] we can observe how the two curves ( namely @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) that are born at the parameter values @xmath26 define a region of non - reducibility around this point .",
    "assume that each of these curves correspond to reducibility - loss bifurcations and they can be written locally with @xmath14 as a graph of @xmath13 ( in @xcite we give concrete conditions under which this is true ) .",
    "in other words , there exist a neighborhood @xmath27 of @xmath0 , interval @xmath28 and functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "assume that the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are written at first order as @xmath35    let @xmath36 be the limit of the parameter values @xmath0 .",
    "the self - similarity in the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map is manifested in the following way .",
    "one observes that @xmath37 . in terms of the parameter space",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the affine map @xmath38 sends ( approximately ) the point @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "we would like to find an analog self - similarity in the parameter space of the forced logistic map ( [ flm ] ) .",
    "we can use the curves @xmath41 to detect this self - similarity .",
    "therefore we look for an affine map of the kind @xmath42 such that it maps the curves @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( and respectively @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) .",
    "if we impose these conditions to the local parameterization ( around @xmath47 ) of the curves considered above then we get @xmath48 for any @xmath49 and @xmath50 . then , replacing @xmath51 in the first coordinate and equating terms in the order of @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath52    using these two equations we have that the value @xmath53 can be estimated as @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 we recover the estimation @xmath56 , which converges to the feigenbaum constant @xmath8 .",
    "therefore we replace @xmath55 by @xmath8 in the estimation of @xmath53 , obtaining @xmath57 .    to obtain a numerical approximation of the values @xmath58 we have computed points in the curve @xmath59 for small values of @xmath60 for different values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 a prescribed value depending on @xmath2 ( which have been decreased when we increased @xmath2 ) .",
    "then , we have used this set of points to estimate the value @xmath63 , and we did three steps of extrapolation to improve the accuracy of the results . we have also considered consecutive approximations to estimate the accuracy of the results .",
    "these computations have been done with quadruple precision ( using the library @xcite ) .",
    "to compute each of the values @xmath64 with good accuracy we have used the following procedure .",
    "we have computed the @xmath1 periodic invariant curve of the system approximating it by its fourier expansion .",
    "we use the same method described in section 3.2.1 in @xcite ( originally from @xcite ) to continue the zero lyapunov exponent but tuned to continue the reducibility loss bifurcation curve . to continue this curve",
    "we use the characterization of the reducibility loss bifurcation given by definition 2.3 in @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath58 actually depend on @xmath12 ( the rotation number of the system ) . hence , from now on , we write @xmath65 .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath66 for the family ( [ flm ] ) when @xmath15 are shown in table [ taula a ] . we have included the ratios @xmath67 in the third column of the table .",
    "the value @xmath68 in the fourth column corresponds to the estimated accuracy ( in absolute terms ) for the value of @xmath69 . in tables",
    "[ taula 2 ] and [ taula 4 ] we included the same values for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we have computed the approximate value of @xmath72 for the same values of @xmath12 , but in all cases the value obtained has been equal ( in the accuracy of the computations ) to @xmath73 . because of that these results will be omitted of the discussion .",
    "we can observe in tables [ taula a ] , [ taula 2 ] and [ taula 4 ] that the ratios @xmath74 do not converge to a constant .",
    "therefore ( a priory ) it seems that there are no self - similarity of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "in fact , we will see in section [ sec : self renor bif diag ] that one has to do a more subtle analysis to uncover the self - similarity properties of the family .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the ratios @xmath74 on the third column of table [ taula a ] are approximately the same values on the third column of table [ taula a ] , but shifted on the index value @xmath2 by one position .",
    "actually , the bigger is @xmath2 the closer are the values .",
    "the same phenomenon can be observed in tables [ taula 2 ] and [ taula 4 ] .",
    "let us introduce some additional notation to follow with the analysis of this phenomenon .",
    "consider @xmath75 a quasi - periodic forced map as follows , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a @xmath78 map and @xmath12 an irrational number .",
    "this map @xmath75 can be identified with a pair @xmath79 .",
    "consider @xmath80 the slope of the reducibility - loss bifurcation introduced before .",
    "nothing ensures yet their existence for a general map @xmath81 , but whenever they exist they can be thought also depending , not only on @xmath12 , but also on the function @xmath77 of the map @xmath75 considered @xcite . in other words",
    "we consider @xmath82",
    ".    given two sequences @xmath83 and @xmath84 of real numbers , we say that they are * asymptotically equivalent * @xcite if there exists @xmath85 and @xmath86 such that @xmath87 we denote this equivalence relation simply by @xmath88 .",
    "now we can resume the discussion on the phenomenon observed on tables [ taula a ] , [ taula 2 ] and [ taula 4 ] .",
    "our numerical computations suggest that @xmath89    consider two different values @xmath90 and @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .",
    "if equation ( [ equation equivalence of sequences ] ) is true , then @xmath93 and @xmath94 should be asymptotically equivalent .",
    "this can be checked numerically . in table [ taula b ]",
    "we have recomputed the same values of table [ taula a ] but this time for @xmath95 ( and @xmath77 the function associated to the map ( [ flm ] ) as before ) .",
    "again the results obtained show asymptotic equivalence .    given @xmath75 a skew product map like ( [ q.p .",
    "forced system ] ) , let @xmath96 denote the map composed with itself .",
    "concretely , the map @xmath96 is given as @xmath97 . to simplify the notation ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath98 the map defined as @xmath99 .",
    "then we have that the map @xmath96 corresponds to the pair @xmath100 .",
    "moreover we have that the @xmath101 periodic curves are @xmath102 periodic curves of the map @xmath96 , therefore @xmath103 .",
    "hence the relation given by ( [ equation equivalence of sequences ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath104    now we have that the relation given by ( [ equation equivalence of sequences ] ) can be explained as a consequence of a much more general phenomenon .",
    "we believe that the sequence @xmath105 is ( asymptotically ) * universal * , in the sense that it does not depend on the map @xmath77 . this would imply ( [ equation equivalence of sequences 2 ] ) and consequently ( [ equation equivalence of sequences ] ) .    to check the universality of the sequence , we consider the following map , @xmath106 this map is like ( [ flm ] ) but with an additive forcing instead of a multiplicative one . in the literature , sometimes ( [ flm ] )",
    "is referred as the driven logistic map and ( [ flm b ] ) is referred as the forced logistic map .",
    "we do not do this distinction in this paper and we consider both as two different versions of the forced logistic map .",
    "note that both maps are in the class of quasi - periodically forced one dimensional unimodal maps , with a quasi - periodic forcing of the type @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a function of one variable .",
    "this is certainly a very restrictive class of maps . in section",
    "[ subsection counter example of universality . ]",
    "we explore what happens when the quasi - periodic forcing is not of this form .",
    "we have computed the slopes @xmath80 , the associated ratios @xmath109 and the estimation of the accuracy for the family ( [ flm b ] ) as we did before for the family ( [ flm ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in table [ taula abis ] for @xmath110 and table [ taula 2bis ] for @xmath111 .",
    "now we can compare the sequences @xmath112 in table [ taula a ] ( respectively [ taula 2 ] ) with the ones of table [ taula abis ] ( respectively [ taula 2bis ] ) .",
    "again we can observe that both sequences have an equivalent asymptotic behavior for equal values of @xmath12 .",
    "this agrees with the conjectured universal behavior .      in order to find self - similarity properties of the parameter space we need to refine our analysis .",
    "given a one dimensional map in the interval @xmath113 , its ( doubling ) renormalization is defined as @xmath114 with @xmath115 an affine transformation .",
    "given a q.p . forced map like ( [ q.p .",
    "forced system ] ) , one might try to define a renormalization for these kind of maps . the most simple choice would be to define its ( doubling ) renormalization also as @xmath116 , with @xmath115 a suitable affine map . if the map @xmath75 has rotation number @xmath12 , its ( doubling ) renormalization will have rotation number @xmath117 .",
    "this is due to the composition of @xmath75 with itself when we define its renormalization .",
    "this argument become more clear in the rigorous definition of the renormalization operator for quasi - periodically maps done in @xcite .    ) for @xmath15 on the left hand side and for @xmath118 on the right .",
    "see table [ table coding diagrams ] for the coding of each color and the text for more details.,width=566 ]    consider the reducibility loss curves @xmath41 as in the parameter space of the map ( [ flm ] ) ( see section [ sec : descrip comp ] ) .",
    "we have that these curves depend on the rotation number ( i.e. @xmath119 ) .",
    "now we can look for self - similarity of the parameter space as in section [ sec : descrip comp ] but taking into account the doubling of the rotation number .",
    "in other words we can look for affine relationship between the bifurcation diagram around @xmath0 for @xmath90 and the bifurcation diagram around @xmath40 for @xmath120 .",
    "consider an affine map like ( [ equation afine transformation parameters ] ) , but such that it maps the curves @xmath121 to @xmath122 ( and respectively @xmath123 to @xmath124 ) .",
    "redoing the same computation of section [ sec : descrip comp ] we have that if there exists an affine relation between the parameters spaces it should be given by @xmath125 .    in table",
    "[ taula relacions ] we have estimations of these values for the family ( [ flm ] ) for @xmath126 ( left ) and @xmath127 ( right ) . in table [ taula relacions bis ] we have the same estimation for the family ( [ flm b ] ) and @xmath126 . in all cases",
    "the sequence converges to a concrete value .",
    "this convergence means that there exists an affine relation between the reducibility loss bifurcation curves around the superstable periodic orbits of the uncoupled map .",
    "note that the limit constants obtained in each of these three cases are different one to each other .",
    "this indicates that the renormalization factor depends both on the value of @xmath12 taken and the family of maps considered .",
    "therefore the renormalization factor @xmath53 is not universal .",
    "these evidences of self - similarity are only valid for infinitely small values of the coupling parameter @xmath13 .",
    "if the self - similarity between families extends to larger values of @xmath13 , the bifurcation diagram of the map ( [ flm ] ) in a box @xmath128 of the parameters space for a prescribed @xmath129 should be approximately the same as the diagram in the box @xmath130 for @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the affine map ( [ equation afine transformation parameters ] ) .    in figure [ flm parameter space 2 ] we have a bifurcation diagram of the map ( [ flm ] ) analog to the one displayed in figure [ flm parameter space ] .",
    "the boxes have been selected such that the one in the left is the image of the one in the right through the affine map @xmath132 given by ( [ equation afine transformation parameters ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath55 has been taken equal to the feigenbaum constant ( @xmath133 ) and @xmath134 the experimental value obtained in table [ taula relacions ] .",
    "the results indicate that self - similarity properties extend to the whole reducibility region around each period doubling bifurcation .",
    "a natural question to ask after the numerical evidences of universality and renormalization reported in the previous sections is `` how general are these phenomena ? '' . in this section",
    "we present an example which demonstrates that the universality and the self similarity properties depend on the fourier expansion of the quasi - periodic forcing .",
    "we must say that we designed this example after developing some of the theory presented in @xcite and the cited theory provides a theoretical explanation to both behaviors .",
    "consider the following family , @xmath135 we consider @xmath136 a fixed value and @xmath14 and @xmath13 as true parameters , obtaining a two parametric family .",
    "remark that for @xmath137 we recover the family ( [ flm b ] ) introduced in section [ sec : universality ratio sequence ] .",
    "we have done the computation of the values @xmath80 for the family ( [ flm c ] ) , for @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the results are shown in tables [ taula contraexemple 1.1 ] to [ taula contraexemple 001.2 ] . to compute the values in the tables",
    "we have used the same procedure that we have used for the families ( [ flm ] ) and ( [ flm b ] ) before . in these tables",
    "we have also included the estimated values of the ratios @xmath140 and the estimated accuracies . in table",
    "[ taula relacions afins contraexemple ] we include the ratios @xmath141 and the differences @xmath142 .    in the third column of tables",
    "[ taula contraexemple 1.1 ] to [ taula contraexemple 001.2 ] we can observe that the sequence of ratios @xmath140 ceases to be universal .",
    "in other words , the sequence is not asymptotically equivalent to the sequences obtained for the maps ( [ flm ] ) and ( [ flm b ] ) ( displayed in tables [ taula a ] to [ taula 2bis ] ) .",
    "we can also observe in table [ taula relacions afins contraexemple ] that the different sequences @xmath143 cease to converge . recall that the limit of this sequence gives us the scale factor between the bifurcations diagram of the map and itself for a doubled period .",
    "in other words , the self - similarity properties of the maps disappear .    analyzing the results with more detail",
    "we can observe in tables [ taula contraexemple 1.1 ] to [ taula relacions afins contraexemple ] that ( when the parameter @xmath136 is small ) the map is not self - similar , but it behaves `` close to self - similar '' in the following sense .",
    "the values @xmath80 of the family ( [ flm c ] ) ( see tables [ taula contraexemple 1.1 ] to [ taula contraexemple 001.2 ] ) differ form the same values of the family ( [ flm b ] ) ( see tables [ taula a ] and [ taula 2 ] ) an order of magnitude similar to the magnitude of @xmath136 . the same happens with the sequences @xmath140 and @xmath144 .",
    "actually , this indicates that if two maps are `` close '' , they still being `` close '' after several renormalizations ( or after several magnifications of the parameter space ) .",
    "in this paper we have done a numerical study of the asymptotic behavior of the slopes @xmath145 of the reducibility loss bifurcations of quasi - periodic perturbations of the logistic map .",
    "concretely we have considered families of maps in the cylinder @xmath9 which can be written as , @xmath146 with @xmath12 an irrational number .",
    "our numerical discoveries can be summarized as follows .    * * first numerical observation * ( section [ sec : universality ratio sequence ] ) : the sequence @xmath147 is not convergent in @xmath2 .",
    "but , for @xmath12 fix , one obtains the same sequence for any family of quasi - periodic forced maps like ( [ flm family ] ) , with a quasi - periodic forcing of the type @xmath148 . * * second numerical observation * ( section [ sec : self renor bif diag ] ) : the sequence @xmath149 is convergent in @xmath2 when the quasi - periodic forcing of the type @xmath150 .",
    "the limit depends on @xmath12 and on the particular family considered . * * third numerical observation * ( section [ subsection counter example of universality . ] ) : the two previous observations are not true when the quasi - periodic forcing is of the type @xmath151 when @xmath152 .",
    "but the sequence @xmath149 associated to the map ( [ flm family ] ) with @xmath153 is @xmath136-close to the same maps with @xmath154    these numerical observations evidence the existence of some structure which govern the asymptotic behavior of the sequence @xmath80 .",
    "this structure is indeed the fixed point of a suitable renormalization operator acting on the space of functions where the families live .",
    "the dynamics of this operator determine the asymptotic behavior of the sequences @xmath147 .",
    "this dynamics depend on the fourier expansion of the quasi - periodic forcing @xmath155 , giving place to different behaviors depending on the number of non - trivial fourier nodes of @xmath155 .",
    "this is described with much more detail in the series of papers @xcite . in the first one we give the definition of the operator for the case of quasi - periodic maps and we use it to prove the existence of reducibility loss bifurcations when the coupling parameter goes to zero . in the second one",
    "we give a theoretical explanation to each of the numerical observations above in terms of the dynamics of the quasi - periodic renormalization operator .",
