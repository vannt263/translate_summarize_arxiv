    "in fact , natural autapses are self - feedback connections in the nervous system and may allow a unique type of self - control , similar to the feedback in other systems  @xcite .",
    "actually , feedback creates a circuit , or loop , that connects a system to itself and commonly occurs in many systems , e.g. , gene regulatory networks  @xcite , population dynamics  @xcite , and climate systems  @xcite .",

    "some reports also suggested that autapses are connected to some neural diseases  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath20 value of mode - locking of a neuron with a high autaptic intensity exhibits periodic behavior .    with autaptic self - feedback , the responses of an hh neuron to a sinusoidal stimulus can have higher or lower @xmath20 mode - locking responses than that of a neuron without an autapse .",
    "these dynamical behaviors depend on the autaptic intensity and the delay time .",

    "this periodicity of the changes in the output frequency ( isi distributions ) in response to changes in the delay time is also similar to the intrinsic period of the neuron .",

    "however , smaller noise levels and stronger autaptic intensities induce different synchronization phenomena between the delay time and the intrinsic time scales . the delay time and",

    "when the delay time is close to integer multiples of the period of the intrinsic oscillations , the autapse enhances the weak periodic signal detection for the optimal values of the intrinsic noise and the autaptic intensity .",
    "the system response also exhibits stochastic resonance behavior , depending on the autaptic intensity .",
    "moreover , the weak signal detection capability of the hh neuron is strongly dependent on the cell size and autaptic strength .",

    "the current theoretical studies on the topic of autaptic connections also reported the importance of autapses and the many novel dynamic behaviors induced by the autapse  @xcite .",
    "autapses provide a control option that can sufficiently adjust the firing behaviors of a neuron for any form of input stimulus , regardless of the neuron type .",
    "autapses offer a new mechanism for switching between quiescent , periodic and chaotic firing patterns in bursting neurons  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the nervous system responds rapidly to an external stimulus based on the transition between neuron firing patterns  @xcite .",
    "thus , the results of the firing pattern transition induced by an autapse also indicate that an autapse could act as an efficient tool for controlling the transition among different relevant neuronal activities in the nervous system .    for an hh neuron with an autapse ,",
    "the firing frequency and interspike interval distributions of the output spike train show periodic behavior when the delay time is increased  @xcite . when specific autaptic parameters are chosen , the response spike trains are nearly regular , and the isi distribution covers a small area , even with a highly random input .",
    "this phenomenon emphassises the autapse - induced filtering behaviors of the neuron .",
    "these results about the autapse are useful for studying the control of a nonlinear system .    in neuronal systems",
    ", an autapse can take the form of recurrent excitation , i.e. , the discharge of a neuron , possibly after passing through the axon , can subsequently induce an excitatory response in the same neuron .",
    "this self - excitation mechanism is important for maintaining persistent activity , particularly the feeding behavior in sea slugs .",
    "leonel et al . also reported that such processes play functional roles in amplifying activity in neuronal assemblies , causing reverberating activity , inducing some form of memory , or generating rhythmic patterns , such as those in central pattern generators  @xcite .",
    "the previous experimental data also indicate that the brain tissue expresses a novel form of self inhibition , namely autaptic inhibitory transmission in fast - spike ( fs ) cells slow self activities in interneurons  @xcite .",
    "ma et al . also investigated the activities of a two - dimensional neural network containing autapses with different time delays and found that the autapses induced many novel collective behaviors  @xcite .",
    "the effect of autapse on the synchronization of neural network have also been conducted in a group of hh neurons with small world network structure  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the neurons exhibit synchronization transitions as autaptic delay feedback is varied , and fine synchronized network activities occur when an optimal autaptic strength is chosen .",
    "alberto bacci and his colleagues studied the autaptic self - inhibition of basket cells and the role of the autaptic connections of disinhibition within cortical circuits and argued that autaptic feedback could have a dual function in temporally coordinating parvalbumin basket cells during cortical network activity  @xcite .",
    "another study also indicated that fast spiking neurons with autapses showed the strongest asynchronous release in brain slices obtained from patients with intractable epilepsy , and that such discharges may be involved in generating and regulating network activities , including epileptic activity  @xcite .",
    "although there are many studies on the topic of the autapse , the precise function of autapses and their contribution to information processing are remain unclear .",
    "there are also many open questions both in the experimental and theoretical areas : 1 ) what is the role of autapses in coordinating network activities ?",
    "i.e. , fs cell autapses in adjusting fast network synchrony .",
    "2 ) what are the molecular mechanisms underlying autaptic asynchronous release and what is its relevance during physiological and pathological network activities ?",
    "3 ) what are the functions of autapses in the information propagation in the neural circuit and neural network ? addressing these questions will also facilitate our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing several core functions of cortical activities ."
