    "heat engines and refrigerators are two prominent examples of thermal machines .",
    "while heat engines produce work by absorbing heat from a hot reservoir , refrigerators consume work to extract heat from a cold reservoir @xcite . in a sense",
    ", refrigerators thus appear as heat engines functioning in reverse . in equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "this symmetry is reflected in their maximum efficiency ( traditionally called coefficient of performance for refrigerators @xcite ) : the maximum efficiency of any heat engine operating cyclically between two thermal reservoirs at temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is given by the carnot formula , @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding maximum coefficient of performance of any refrigerator is @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , this analogy between the two devices is only superficial and their finite - time behavior is radically different .",
    "the theory of equilibrium thermodynamics has lately been extended in two different directions : finite - time thermodynamics @xcite and quantum thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium carnot expressions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are only of limited practical importance since they may only be reached for machines that run infinitely slowly . in this quasistatic limit , a core assumption of equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , the power output of a device vanishes .",
    "the efficiency at maximum power @xmath7 of a heat engine , and the corresponding coefficient of performance at maximum figure of merit @xmath8 of a refrigerator , are two quantities of far greater significance for real machines that operate in finite time .",
    "their investigation via the optimization of nonequilibrium processes beyond the quasistatic approximation is one of the main goals of finite - time thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "a central result for the efficiency at maximum power of a heat engine is the so - called curzon - ahlborn efficiency , @xmath9 , obtained independently by reitlinger @xcite , chambadal @xcite , yvon @xcite , novikov @xcite and curzon - ahlborn @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a history of the formula ) . at about the same time , starting with the work of scovil and schulz - dubois on maser heat engines @xcite , refrigerators @xcite and heat pumps @xcite , the investigation of thermal machines has been extended to the low - temperature , quantum regime @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a variety of theoretical studies have shown that the performance of quantum thermal machines may be enhanced beyond the classical carnot limit @xcite .",
    "a standard model of a quantum heat engine consists of a single harmonic oscillator @xcite ( or equivalently a two - level system @xcite ) that is alternately connected to a hot and a cold reservoir .",
    "two important cases are usually distinguished @xcite : the adiabatic limit which corresponds to slow expansion / compression phases ( compared to the free dynamics of the system ) and the sudden limit of fast expansion / compression . in both instances , the finite - time performance of the machine can be studied analytically .",
    "a detailed investigation of the efficiency at maximum power of a quantum harmonic heat engine in these two limits may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) in the high - temperature ( classical ) regime . as expected",
    ", the efficiency at maximum power @xmath7 coincides with the classical curzon - ahlborn expression for adiabatic driving .",
    "however , @xmath7 is much lower for sudden driving and is found to be bounded from above by one half instead of one .",
    "these results have been generalized to the low - temperature ( quantum ) domain in ref .",
    "@xcite and were shown to depend explicitly on the reduced planck constant @xmath10 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the finite - time analysis of the performance of refrigerators is more involved than that of heat engines .",
    "it has for this reason only been completed much later @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties is the identification of a proper optimization criterion : the maximization of the cooling power or the minimization of the power input , for instance , do not result in a temperature - dependent bound for the coefficient of performance , in contrast to what is known for heat engines @xcite .",
    "the finite - time counterpart of the curzon - ahlborn efficiency for refrigerators was first obtained by yan @xcite and yan and chen @xcite in the late 1980s and rediscovered by velasco and coworkers in 1997 @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "it is given by @xmath11 with an optimization criterion ( the figure of merit ) that is taken as the product of the coefficient of performance @xmath12 and the cooling power of the refrigerator ( see eq .",
    "( 7 ) below ) .",
    "it has recently been shown that this optimization criterion for refrigerators is indeed in true correspondence to the maximum power criterion for heat engines @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "additional results for the coefficient of performance at maximum figure of merit have been reported for quantum refrigerator models @xcite . however , to our knowledge , only the high - temperature ( classical ) expression of @xmath8 in the adiabatic limit has been determined so far .",
    "analytical results are missing for the important low - temperature ( quantum ) domain , both for adiabatic and fast driving , as well as for fast driving in the classical regime .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a quantum otto refrigerator cycle for a time - dependent harmonic oscillator , a paradigmatic model for a quantum thermal machine @xcite .",
    "we first derive an exact formula for its coefficient of performance that is valid for any frequency driving and reservoir temperatures .",
    "we use this equation to evaluate the optimal coefficient of performance both in the high - temperature ( classical ) and low - temperature ( quantum ) regime , for slow and fast frequency modulations .",
    "we further show that the cooling cycle breaks down for strongly nonadiabatic driving and present an approximate expression for the minimal driving time permitted for cooling .",
    "]    we study a quantum otto refrigerator based on a harmonic oscillator with time - dependent frequency .",
    "the four branches of the cycle are ( see fig .",
    "[ cycle ] ) : ( 1 ) isentropic compression @xmath13 : the oscillator is isolated from the reservoirs and its frequency is increased from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "work is added to the system during this process whereas entropy is constant .",
    "( 2 ) hot isochore @xmath16 : the frequency is kept fixed while the oscillator thermalizes to state @xmath17 characterized by the inverse temperature @xmath18 of the hot reservoir .",

    "( 4 ) cold isochore @xmath20 : the system is brought back to the initial thermal state @xmath21 by coupling it , at fixed frequency , to the cold reservoir with inverse temperature @xmath22 .",
    "expansion / compression phases need not be infinitely slow as usually assumed in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the analysis of the performance of the refrigerator requires the evaluation of the mean energies of the quantum oscillator at the four corners of the cycle , in analogy to the case of the quantum otto heat engine @xcite :    [ s1 ] @xmath23    we have here introduced the dimensionless quantity @xmath24 which depends on the speed of the frequency driving @xcite .",
