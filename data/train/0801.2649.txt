    "dust grains play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "dust grains control the energy balance in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by absorbing stellar light and reemitting it in far infrared ( fir ) .",
    "also , the surface of dust grains is a site for an efficient formation of h@xmath6 molecules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which act as an effective coolant in metal - poor ism .",
    "those effects of dust turn on even at @xmath7% of the solar metallicity according to the calculation by @xcite , who argue that the star formation rate is enhanced because of the first dust enrichment in the history of galaxy evolution .",
    "the first sources of dust in the universe are type ii ( core - collapse ) supernovae ( sne ii ) or pair instability supernovae ( pisne ) , since the lifetimes of their progenitors are short ( @xmath8 yr ) . in the local universe , dust grains are also produced by evolved low mass stars @xcite , but this production mechanism requires much longer ( @xmath9 gyr ) timescales .",
    "the first dust supplied by sne ii or pisne may trigger the formation of low - mass stars via dust cooling @xcite .    to quantify the above effects of dust in the early stages of galaxy evolution , it is crucial to know how much dust and what species of grains form in supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "it has been suggested by some observations of nearby sne that dust is indeed produced in sne , although the quantity of formed dust is still debated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by treating the nucleation and accretion in sne , the dust composition and size distribution",
    "are theoretically calculated @xcite .",
    "recently , in order to examine the effects of dust in population iii ( pop iii ) objects , the formation of dust in sne ii and pisne is extensively examined ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n03 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "the motivation for considering pisne comes from some evidence indicating that the stars formed from metal - free gas , population iii ( popiii ) stars , are very massive with a characteristic mass of a few hundred solar masses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such massive stars are considered to begin pair creation of electron and positron after the helium burning phase , and finally an explosive nuclear reaction disrupts the whole stars @xcite .",
    "this explosion is called pisn .",
    "recently , the hypothesis that the dust formation is dominated by sne ii and/or pisne at high redshift ( @xmath5 ) is observationally examined for some objects .",
    "we expect that at @xmath0 , when the cosmic age is less than 1 gyr , the main sources of dust grains are sne ii and pisne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "extinction curves can be used to investigate the dust properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using a sample of broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars , @xcite",
    "show that the extinction properties of the low-@xmath5 ( @xmath10 ) sample is different from those of the high-@xmath5 ( @xmath11 ) sample .",
    "this result is suggestive of a change in the dust production mechanism in the course of galaxy evolution .",
    "the highest-@xmath5 bal quasar in their sample , sdss j104845.05 + 463718.3 ( hereafter ) at @xmath3 shows an extinction curve flat at wavelength @xmath12   and rising at @xmath13  .",
    "@xcite show that the extinction curve of   is in excellent agreement with the sn ii dust models by @xcite .",
    "@xcite consider dust destruction by reverse shock in sne , suggesting that 220% of the initial dust mass survives , and that the extinction curve after the destruction is still consistent with that of .",
    "more recently , @xcite show that the dust extinction in the host galaxy of grb 050904 at @xmath14 can be explained by the extinction curve of , further supporting that the sne ii are the main sources of dust at @xmath15 . also ,",
    "@xcite find a similar extinction property for cfhqs j1509 - 1749 ( @xmath16 ) to that of .",
    "there are other series of theoretical papers on the extinction curves of high-@xmath5 objects .",
    "* hereafter h05 ) calculate the extinction curve based on the dust production calculation by n03 .",
    "they also reproduce the extinction curve of  by using the the dust production in sne ii , although the dust composition and size distribution are different from those of @xcite . recently ,",
    "* hereafter n07 ) have treated the dust destruction by the reverse shock as done by @xcite , but considering the motion of dust relative to gas caused by the drag force and the destruction of dust in the radiative phase as well as in the non - radiative phase of supernova remnants .",
    "then , they show that the size distribution of grains supplied in the ism is strongly modified by the reverse shock .",
    "grains smaller than @xmath17 m are efficiently destroyed if the ambient hydrogen number density is larger than 0.1 @xmath2 . thus , it is important to reexamine the consistency between the observed extinction curve and the reverse shock destruction .    in this paper , we calculate the extinction curves based on the dust properties calculated by n07 , who have focused on the effect of reverse shock destruction in sne . then , we compare the results with observed extinction curves at high @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe our theoretical treatment to calculate the extinction curves of sn ii and pisn dust in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "we show and examine our results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss our results from the observational viewpoint in section [ sec : obs ] , and finally give the conclusion of this paper in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we derive the theoretical extinction curves of dust grains produced in sne ii and pisne and subsequently destroyed by the reverse shock .",
    "those grains are considered to be supplied in the interstellar spaces .",
    "the grain composition and size distribution in sne before the destruction is calculated by n03 , whose results are adopted as the initial conditions for the calculations of reverse shock destruction by n07 . by using the results by n07 ,",
    "the extinction curves are calculated by the same method as in h05 .",
    "the outline of our calculation is reviewed as follows .",
    "n03 calculate the dust composition and size distribution in the ejecta of popiii sne ii and pisne based on the supernova model of @xcite , carefully treating the radial density profile and the temperature evolution . as mentioned in h05 , the resulting grain composition and size distribution are not sensitive to the metallicity of progenitor ( n03 ) .",
    "thus , the assumption of zero - metallicity is not essential in this paper , and our results can be applicable to metal - enriched systems .",
    "since it is still uncertain how efficiently the mixing of atoms within sne occurs , n03 treat two extreme cases for the mixing of elements : one is the _ unmixed _ case in which the original onion - like structure of elements is preserved , and the other is the _",
    "mixed _ case in which the elements are uniformly mixed within the helium core .",
    "they show that the formed dust species depend largely on the mixing of seed elements within sne , because the dominant reactions change depending on the ratio of available elements .",
    "the formed grain species in the calculation of n03 are listed in table [ tab : species ] .",
    ".summary of grain species .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : species ]    in the unmixed ejecta , a variety of grain species ( si , fe , mg@xmath6sio@xmath18 , mgsio@xmath19 , mgo , al@xmath6o@xmath19 , sio@xmath6 , fes , and c ) condense , while in the mixed ejecta , only oxide grains ( sio@xmath6 , mgsio@xmath19 , mg@xmath6sio@xmath18 , al@xmath6o@xmath19 , and fe@xmath19o@xmath18 ) form .",
    "the species are summarized in table [ tab : species ] .",
    "based on the results in n03 , n07 treat the dust destruction by the reverse shock in the supernova remnant .",
    "they find that small - sized grains suffer dust destruction by the reverse shock and that the final grain size distribution is biased to larger grains than the original distribution calculated by n03 .",
    "we adopt their results as the properties of grains supplied to the interstellar space .",
    "following h05 , we adopt the representative progenitor mass of sne ii as 20 @xmath20 and that of pisne as 170 @xmath20 .",
    "we also investigate the mixed and unmixed cases .",
    "therefore , we treat four cases :    \\(a ) mixed sne ii ;    \\(b ) unmixed sne ii ;    \\(c ) mixed pisne ; and    \\(d ) unmixed pisne .    all the formulation and the results can be seen in n03 and n07 . the grains are assumed to be homogeneous and spherical .      in order to calculate extinction curves , the optical constants of grains are necessary .",
    "we adopt the references listed in table [ tab : species ] for the optical constants . here",
    ", we only explain the difference from h05 .",
    "the optical constants are updated for fe@xmath19o@xmath18 . for mgsio@xmath19 , we adopt the optical constants of mg@xmath6sio@xmath18 at @xmath21 m , where the currently available experimental data are relatively poor @xcite . for si and sio@xmath6 , we adopt the optical constants for amorphous instead of crystal since the grains rapidly grow in sne .",
    "subsequent sputtering due to the reverse shock may also tend to destroy crystal structures and to form more complicated amorphous solids .",
    "the infrared broad feature at @xmath22 m is also better explained by amorphous sio@xmath6 than by crystal sio@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we discuss the uncertainty in the assumed optical constants in appendix [ subsec : uncertainty ] .    by using those optical constants",
    ", we calculate the absorption and scattering cross sections of homogeneous spherical grains with various sizes based on the mie theory @xcite .",
    "then , the opacity of grain @xmath23 ( @xmath23 denotes a grain species ) as a function of wavelength , @xmath24 , is calculated by weighting the cross sections according to the size distribution .",
    "the extinction curve is presented in the form of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the extinction in units of magnitude at wavelength @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a reference wavelength ) .",
    "the extinction in units of magnitude is proportional to the optical depth as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the extinction of species @xmath23 in units of magnitude as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the total extinction @xmath26 is calculated by summing @xmath30 for all the concerning species : @xmath31 for more details , see h05 .",
    "since we normalize the extinction at a certain wavelength @xmath28 , only relative values of @xmath24 are important .",
    "as shown in n07 , the final size distribution of grains after the reverse shock destruction is sensitive to the density of the ambient ism . here",
    "we start from the results for @xmath32 @xmath2 , where @xmath33 is the hydrogen number density in the ambient medium , to examine the effect of grain destruction on the extinction curve . in figure",
    "[ fig : n1 ] , we show the resulting extinction curves of the four cases in section [ subsec : nozawa ] .",
    "the contribution of each species is also shown .",
    "we normalize the extinction to @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath35 m ) .",
    "the extinction curves of dust produced by the mixed sne ii and pisne are dominated by sio@xmath6 ( figures [ fig : n1]a and c ; in the pisn case , only the contribution from sio@xmath6 appears and the total extinction curve is identical to the extinction curve of sio@xmath6 ) .",
    "the extinction curve is flatter than that without destruction because the reverse shock efficiently destroys small grains and the mean grain size becomes larger .",
    "the extinction curve for the unmixed sne ii ( figure [ fig : n1]b ) is dominated by si and c. however , as shown in h05 , the extinction curve without reverse shock destruction is dominated by mg@xmath6sio@xmath18 and fes for @xmath36 m and by si for @xmath37 m . since si and c grains are larger than the other species , they survive the reverse shock more than the others . for the same reason ,",
    "the extinction curve of unmixed pisne is dominated by si . also for the unmixed sne ii and pisne , the extinction curves of grains after the reverse shock destruction are flatter , since small - sized grains are selectively destroyed and the mean size of the grains becomes large .",
    "as shown by n07 , the efficiency of the reverse shock destruction is sensitive to the density of the ambient medium .",
    "here we investigate the variation of the extinction curve for various ambient densities .",
    "n07 have examined three cases for the ambient hydrogen number density : @xmath38 , 1 , and 10 @xmath2 .",
    "n07 show that the grains are almost completely destroyed for @xmath39 @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we calculate the cases for @xmath38 and 1 @xmath2 . for comparison , we also show the results without the reverse shock destruction ( this case is called non - destruction case ) . for the details for the non - destruction case , see n03 and h05 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : ncomp ] . as expected , the extinction curve becomes flatter for a larger ambient density because the destruction efficiency of small - sized grains is larger . in section [ sec : obs ] , our results are compared with high-@xmath5 data of extinction curve .",
    "@xcite also state that the extinction curve becomes flatter , although they start from a different dust formation model based on @xcite .",
    "the differences between @xcite and the present work are partly due to the differences in optical constants : amorphous carbon is responsible for most of the extinction in their work . furthermore , their results show more survival of small grains than those of n07 .",
    "as mentioned in n07 , the difference comes from the treatment of grain motion : in n07 , the trap of grains in a hot and dense zone between forward and reverse shocks is properly treated , and this effect enhances the destruction of small - sized grains .",
    "thus , our results show flatter extinction curves than those of @xcite especially when the ambient gas density is large .",
    "h05 show that the dust production model of the unmixed sne ii in n03 is consistent with the extinction curve of .",
    "however , it is crucial to compare our new results including the reverse shock destruction with . in particular",
    ", we may obtain constraints on the ambient gas density as well as the progenitors .",
    "we compare our results with the restframe uv extinction curve of .",
    "the plausible range derived by @xcite is shown by the shaded areas in figure [ fig : maiolino ] .             in each panel of figure [ fig : maiolino ] , we show the theoretical extinction curves calculated for various ambient hydrogen number densities ( same as figure [ fig : ncomp ] but normalized to the extinction at @xmath40 m , i.e. , @xmath41 m ) .",
    "we also show the results of the non - destruction case . because of the variation caused by the destruction , various types of progenitors may be allowed .",
    "for example , the mixed sne ii are consistent with the observed extinction curve if @xmath42 @xmath2 . in all cases ,",
    "the ambient number density @xmath1 @xmath2 produces too flat extinction curves to be consistent with the data .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have shown that the extinction curves are sensitive to the ambient density of sne .",
    "thus , it is important to constrain the density first .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct observational constraint on the gas density in .",
    "it is rather interesting to point out that the extinction curves for @xmath43 @xmath2 of the unmixed sne ii is quite consistent with the extinction curves of .",
    "the mixed sne ii also reproduce the observational extinction curve quite well if the ambient hydrogen number density is @xmath7 @xmath2",
    ". the extinction curves of pisne are too flat for @xmath1 @xmath2 . considering the uncertainty in the observational data ,",
    "however , the extinction curves of pisne are not rejected for @xmath441 @xmath2 .    theoretically , it is possible to examine the density evolution around the progenitors of sne .",
    "@xcite show that in small objects whose typical halo mass is @xmath45 , the entire gas cloud is completely swept by the ionization front , and the dynamical expansion of the ionized region reduces the ambient density down to @xmath46 @xmath2 . on the contrary , in more massive objects",
    ", the evacuation of the gas around a massive star does not efficiently occur and the final gas density is much higher .",
    "however , if we consider 3-dimensional complex structure of interstellar medium , the density around a massive star is hard to predict theoretically .",
    "thus , at this moment , a direct constraint on the gas density in  by using for example excitation states of molecular or atomic lines is desired .    in summary , the current observational extinction curve at @xmath4",
    "can be explained by the hypothesis that dust is produced by sne ii and/or pisne and destroyed subsequently by reverse shocks .",
    "in addition , the results in this paper newly propose that the ambient density should be less than @xmath7 @xmath2 , since the reverse shock destruction flattens the extinction curve too much if @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "as shown in section [ sec : results ] , a flat extinction curve is naturally produced by reverse shock destruction in sne . at @xmath0 , where it is probable that sne ii or pisne predominantly supply dust grains , it is worth investigating possibility that extinction curves are flat .    indeed , there are some pieces of supporting evidence for flat extinction curves at @xmath0 . among the sample in @xcite , two bal quasars , sdss j1044@xmath470125 at @xmath48 and sdss j0756 + 4104 at @xmath49 ,",
    "show no reddening but are detected at sub - mm @xcite .",
    "the sub - mm observations yield dust masses in the range @xmath50 for those two quasars .",
    "the absence of reddening and the presence of sub - mm emission ( dust emission ) may be contradictory , but they are consistent if we assume a flat extinction curve .",
    "an extremely small reddening of a bal quasar sdss 1605@xmath470112 at @xmath51 @xcite may also be attributed to a flat extinction curve . in the future ,",
    "extinction curves of high-@xmath5 sub - mm samples @xcite in comparison with theoretical modeling of sub - mm emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) enable us to further investigate the properties and origins of dust grains in the early universe .",
    "also at lower @xmath5 ( @xmath52 ) , it may be worth to consider possibility of flat extinction curves .",
    "direct indications of dust at @xmath53 come , for example , from the reddening of background quasars @xcite .",
    "the depletion of heavy elements in quasar absorption line systems , especially damped ly@xmath54 clouds ( dlas ) , also supports the presence of dust in distant systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are some observational results that show no significant reddening of dlas @xcite .",
    "the flat extinction curve proposed above has importance that the lack of reddening does not necessarily mean the absence of dust .",
    "other than dlas , some objects whose extinction curves are derived by gamma - ray bursts @xcite or by gravitational lensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seem to have a flat extinction curve in uv .",
    "dust grains supplied into interstellar spaces suffer various processes that modify their size distribution .",
    "one of such processes is the destruction by forward shocks of supernova remnants .",
    "the dust destruction by forward shocks has already been examined by @xcite .",
    "here we have examined the effect of forward shock destruction and have confirmed that one passage of a supernova forward shock has negligible influence on the extinction curve .",
    "this is because after an efficient sputtering in supernova remnants the opacity is already dominated by large grains which are hard to destroy .",
    "however , shattering may increase the number of small - size grains @xcite , steepening the extinction curve . quantitative study of the effect of shattering on the extinction curve is left for future work .",
    "we have theoretically investigated the extinction curves of grains produced in sne ii and pisne . since at high @xmath55 , low - mass stars can not be dominant sources for dust grains , sne ii and pisne , whose progenitors are massive stars with short lifetimes , can govern the dust production .",
    "while our previous works ( n03 and h05 ) did not consider the reverse shock destruction induced by a collision with ambient interstellar medium , we adopt the composition and size distribution of grains of n07 , who take into account the reverse shock destruction .",
    "we have found that the extinction curve is sensitive to the ambient gas density around sne , since the efficiency of reverse shock destruction is largely dependent on it .",
    "the destruction is significant for small - sized grains , leading to a flat extinction curve in the optical and uv . such a large ambient density as @xmath1 @xmath2 produces too flat an extinction curve to be consistent with the observed extinction curve for  at @xmath3 .",
    "although the extinction curve is highly sensitive to the ambient density , the hypothesis that the dust is predominantly formed by sne at @xmath4 is still allowed if @xmath33 is smaller than 1 @xmath2 . for further quantification , the ambient density should be constrained by some other methods .",
    "it is worth noting that a flat extinction curve produced by effective reverse shock destruction may explain the absence of reddening of systems in which dust is known to be present by far - infrared / sub - mm emission or by depletion of heavy elements .",
    "we thank r. maiolino and his collaborators for kindly providing us with their data on the extinction curve of .",

    "as mentioned in section [ subsec : method ] , the optical constants of crystal si and sio@xmath6 are available , while we have used those of amorphous si and sio@xmath6 . since those species dominate the extinction curves , it is important to examine the uncertainty caused by assumed material states .",

    "<S> we investigate the extinction curves of young galaxies in which dust is supplied from type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) and/or pair instability supernovae ( pisne ) . since at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) , low - mass stars can not be dominant sources for dust grains , sne ii and pisne , whose progenitors are massive stars with short lifetimes , should govern the dust production . here </S>",
    "<S> , we theoretically investigate the extinction curves of dust produced by sne ii and pisne , taking into account reverse shock destruction induced by collision with ambient interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the extinction curve is sensitive to the ambient gas density around a sn , since the efficiency of reverse shock destruction strongly depends on it . </S>",
    "<S> the destruction is particularly efficient for small - sized grains , leading to a flat extinction curve in the optical and ultraviolet wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> such a large ambient density as @xmath1 @xmath2 produces too flat an extinction curve to be consistent with the observed extinction curve for  at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> although the extinction curve is highly sensitive to the ambient density , the hypothesis that the dust is predominantly formed by sne at @xmath4 is still allowed by the current observational constraints . for further quantification , the ambient density should be obtained by some other methods . </S>",
    "<S> finally we also discuss the importance of our results for observations of high-@xmath5 galaxies , stressing a possibility of flat extinction curves .    </S>",
