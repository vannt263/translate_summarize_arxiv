    "interest in the fourth generation renewed with the  @xmath18 direct cpv ( dcpv ) difference \" puzzle : dcpv in @xmath19 and @xmath20 appeared opposite in sign  @xcite , even though they proceed by the same spectator diagrams .",
    "the effect could be due to  @xcite the nondecoupling of the heavy sm4 @xmath21 quark in the @xmath22 penguin , which brings in a new cpv phase in @xmath4 .",
    "but hadronic effects make the @xmath18 dcpv measurements less amenable to interpretation",
    ".    however , an sm4 effect in the @xmath5 @xmath23-penguin loop should give a correlated effect in the @xmath24 box diagram , making @xmath12 large and negative  @xcite , in contrast with @xmath25 in sm3 .",
    "after the 2006 measurement  @xcite of @xmath26 mixing , i.e. , @xmath27 , by the cdf experiment at the tevatron , the  prediction \" was strengthened  @xcite to ",
    "@xmath28 to @xmath29 for @xmath30 gev .",
    "\" interestingly , by 2008 , both the cdf and d0 experiments reported  @xcite hints for negative @xmath12 ( called respectively @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",

    "i.e. , in same direction as cdf and d0 ! _",
    "so , there was much anticipation for lhcb to unveil their result with 10 times the data .",
    "to one s surprise , however , analyzing 0.34 fb@xmath33 data , the lhcb experiment found  @xcite @xmath35 which is consistent with zero ( hence sm3 ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath14 alone gave @xmath36 , while eq .",
    "( [ phis1108 ] ) is the combined result with @xmath37 .",
    "there was another development that aroused the interest in the fourth generation in the past few years , namely the realization  @xcite in 2007 that electroweak precision tests did not firmly rule out a fourth generation , but rather indicated that the @xmath21 , @xmath38 quarks be heavy , split in mass  but not by too much  while the higgs mass bound would loosen .",
    "the direct search for @xmath21 and @xmath38 at the tevatron had in any case been ongoing . at the lhc , the limit  @xcite of @xmath39 gev ( 95% c.l . )",
    "was reached with 2010 data alone , and became 495 ( 450 ) gev for @xmath38 ( @xmath21 ) by  @xcite summer 2011 .",
    "we are already at the doorstep of the unitarity bound ( ub ) of 500550 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to enhance @xmath2 in sm4 by more than a factor of 2 , because it is constrained by @xmath40 , which is consistent with sm3 in rate .",
    "hence , this mode appeared less relevant for sm4 , until recently . based on 2010 data ,",
    "the competitive limit  @xcite by lhcb was already within 20 times the sm3 expectation of @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "since 2010 , the progress is significant , both at the tevatron and the lhc ( see * note added * ) , and a measurement of @xmath2 at the sm3 level now seems possible with 2011 - 2012 lhc data . with the signal of two charged tracks from a displaced vertex , the cms experiment has demonstrated its competitiveness , in part due to an advantage in luminosity .",
    "the combined result  @xcite of lhcb and cms gives @xmath42 at 95%  cl , which is only 3.5 times the sm3 level .",
    "while @xmath2 has been considered in recent sm4 studies  @xcite , what we point out is that , together with the measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath3 , the ckm element product @xmath4 can be determined . since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are known from tree processes , a measurement of @xmath4 would already complete the @xmath5 quadrangle of eq .",

    "allow large @xmath71 solutions for @xmath80 , with @xmath71 ranging around 0.013 ( 0.011 ) for case b ( c ) .",
    "there is , however , a low @xmath81 overlap region for all @xmath70 , with cases b and c complementing each other , with case b ranging between @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath71 is small , in general @xmath12 would become close to the sm3 value and become small .",
    "the full domain of @xmath70 is allowed , which in turn has different implications for @xmath69 .",
    "note that the contour line of @xmath84 is very close to the sm3 contour of @xmath41 ( the dashed curves in fig .",
    "thus , to the left of @xmath82 ( and to the right of @xmath83 ) for low @xmath71 , @xmath69 is suppressed compared to sm3 ( compare fig .  1(b ) ) , which is precisely case c. this is a case that still might emerge at the lhc , even when @xmath12 is found consistent with sm3 .",
    "the small @xmath12 value can of course turn out to deviate from sm3 when very high precision is reached .",
    "we have focused so far on @xmath12 and @xmath69 , the two @xmath86 physics trump cards in the quest for new physics at the lhc . but a third measurable can be done well by lhcb : the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath87 .",
    "earlier measurements  @xcite by the b factories , and by cdf , found no indication of a zero crossing .",
    "however , the summer 2011 result  @xcite of lhcb once again turned out in support of sm3 .",
    "this has implications on the overlap regions of fig .",
    "the zero crossing point @xmath88 is insensitive to form factors , hence an important probe of possible new physics .",
    "it has been found generally  @xcite that , once other flavor and cpv data are taken into account , the variation in @xmath89 for sm4 probably can not be distinguished from sm3 within experimental resolution . but to investigate the power of lhc data alone , we plot in fig .",
    "3(a ) the contours of constant @xmath89 in the @xmath70@xmath71 plane for @xmath60 , overlaid with the overlap regions of fig .  2 .",
    "we will now show that the consistency of the summer 2011 @xmath90 result of lhcb  @xcite with sm3 rules out the low @xmath70 , high @xmath71 region , as well as the upper tip of allowed region for case a.    we take sample points from the overlap regions , illustrated as small ellipses in fig .",
    "3(a ) , and plot the corresponding @xmath91 vs @xmath92 in fig .  3(b ) , where the black solid curve is for sm3 .",
    "for the more interesting case a , i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 both enhanced over sm3 values , we take @xmath95 which lies near the center of the allowed region for case  a ( third small ellipse from left in fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , and is close to the @xmath96 gev@xmath97 contour .",
    "this is plotted as the red dashed curve in fig .",
    "3(b ) , where we have used the form factor model of ref .",
    "@xcite within qcd factorization framework . indeed , the zero crossing lies lower than the black solid sm3 curve , with @xmath98 weaker than sm3 below the zero crossing .",
    "but away from the zero crossing point , form factor model dependence would set in , hence we deem the vicinity of this region in @xmath70@xmath71 as allowed by @xmath98 .",
    "if one moves to the lower right tip of case  a , one moves closer to @xmath99 gev@xmath97 contour of fig .",
    "3(a ) , hence @xmath98 would be even harder to distinguish from sm3 .",
    "this is illustrated by the green ( light grey ) solid curve in fig .",
    "3(b ) for the sample point of @xmath100 ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , which is indeed hard to distinguish from the sm3 curve .",
    "in fact , it is easily checked that for all points with @xmath81 , @xmath98 would appear sm3-like .",
    "the opposite is true for large @xmath71 case . within case",
    "a , let us take the sample point of @xmath101 , which roughly sits on the @xmath102 gev@xmath97 contour of fig .",
    "3(a ) ( second small ellipse from left ) , and is in the upper , darker shaded region for case a. this point is plotted as the purple dotdashed line in fig .",
    "3(b ) , with indeed @xmath102 gev@xmath97 .",
    "but now the @xmath98 value is so low for all @xmath103 gev@xmath97 , lhcb could probably tell it apart , even with form factor uncertainties .",
    "however , low @xmath98 values would make the precise determination of @xmath89 harder . as an extreme case",

    "3(a ) ) , which is plotted as the blue dotted curve in fig .",
    "this @xmath70@xmath71 combination falls on the @xmath105 gev@xmath97 contour in fig .",
    "3(a ) , as we can see also from the @xmath91 plot . however , @xmath98 now has the _ wrong sign _ as compared with data , hence this region is _ ruled out_. this in fact applies to the whole region to the left of , roughly ( to be determined fully by experiment ) the @xmath106 gev@xmath97 contour . together with the previous point",
    "that @xmath102 gev@xmath97 probably would involve @xmath98 values that are too small , practically all @xmath107 regions are ruled out , or disfavored , by @xmath98 measurement .",
    "a little further explanation can shed light on the @xmath98 behavior .",
    "the differential @xmath91 is proportional to the strength of the wilson coefficient @xmath108 , while the @xmath2 amplitude is proportional to @xmath108 .",
    "the point of convergence of the @xmath89 contours in fig .",
    "3(a ) for @xmath109 corresponds to the vanishing point for @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath108 crosses through zero at this point , and has opposite sign above and below .",
    "this explains the sign of the blue dotted curve in fig .",
    "there is a second convergence point for the @xmath89 contours in fig .",
    "3(a ) , and one could see ellipse shaped contours , e.g. for @xmath110 gev@xmath97 .",
    "this is because @xmath91 is a quadratic function of @xmath111 .",
    "one has similar behavior that the upper part of the @xmath110 gev@xmath97 ellipse give the wrong sign for @xmath98 .",
    "we would like to give some interpretation of the impact of this possible future extraction of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "the quadrangle of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , as shown in fig .  4",
    ", would be larger in area than the @xmath7 or @xmath5 triangles in sm3 by a factor @xmath126 , as the strength of phase angle is similar .",

    "one can picture this in fig .  4 by reducing the length of @xmath129 by 60% , and with the full 360@xmath130 @xmath70 area allowed .",
    "this would probably need more data than 2011 - 2012 to measure .",

    "this could be due to two inputs : allowing the central value of 1.04 ( which violates unitarity ) for @xmath142 , with an error of 0.06 , may have inadvertently overconstrained @xmath143 ; holding to the 2% lattice error for @xmath144 ( with @xmath145 precisely measured ) in their fit , but not allowing the larger values of eqs .",
