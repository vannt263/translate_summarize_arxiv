    "the time evolution of the quantum - system state provides the transformation ( map ) of the initial - state density matrix @xmath7 onto the density matrix at time @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "the density matrix has nonnegative eigenvalues only , and such transformations are called positive maps . among the positive maps ,",
    "there are linear positive maps and nonlinear ones .",
    "the set of linear positive maps contains a subset of completely positive maps .",
    "the properties of the maps were considered in @xcite , and nonlinear maps were discussed in @xcite .    a positive map is a transformation of a density matrix into a density matrix , i.e. , this kind of operation preserves the trace of the density matrix , its hermiticity and positivity . any quantum operation can be expressed as a positive map . in particular , the study of completely positive maps have been of great interest in the quantum information theory ; it provides the result that the transmission of classical or quantum information can be represented by a set of operators defining a completely positive map , also called the quantum channel .",
    "there exist different capacities of a system to transmit information : the classical capacity  @xcite , the quantum capacity  @xcite , and the entangled assisted capacity  @xcite .",
    "some of these capacities can be calculated through the three von neumann entropies , such as the entropy of the input system state @xmath10 , the entropy associated to the map @xmath11 , and the entropy exchange @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the state which , under purification over an ancillary system @xmath14 , gives the input @xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "it is known that non - unitary transformation , such as the generic time evolution of the density matrix can be expressed in terms of a completely positive map , in view of the kraus decomposition  @xcite . for finite - dimensional density matrices ,",
    "such maps were discussed in @xcite .",
    "these linear maps have also been used to construct the time evolution of the initial state for any master equation which is local in time , whether markovian or non - markovian of gorini  kossakowski ",

    "this paper is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    ", we define the discretization of the density matrix of continuous variables , establishing the conditions that should be satisfied to correspond to the positive map .",
    "also in this section the positive map of a discrete @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 density matrix into a cut discrete @xmath22@xmath17@xmath22 density matrix ( @xmath23 ) is discussed in order to address the loss of information on the system .",
    "the entanglement properties of the squeezed vacuum state in the parametric amplifier are obtained in section 3 as an example of the application of the discretization procedure .",
    "the entanglement is calculated through different quantities , such as tsallis entropy , von neumann entropy and linear entropy of the cut density matrices and the logarithmic negativity for the two - mode partial transpose .",
    "the calculation of the covariance matrix is discussed in section 4 .",
    "numerical results are compared with the analytical expressions in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "finally , some conclusions are presented .",
    "in this section , we consider for two - mode field the procedure of discretization of the density matrix @xmath24 , which satisfies the normalization condition @xmath25 to obtain a discrete form , first , we define the discrete numbers of the axes @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the steps @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are such that the numerical convergence of the normalization condition  ( [ norm_cond ] ) is ensured .",
    "this discretization provides the density matrix @xmath35 and this relation constitutes a map of infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath36 onto the finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath37 . in order to define correctly the conjugate transpose matrix @xmath38 and the normalization condition , the steps in the variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 should be @xmath41 and also @xmath42",
    ". then the discrete normalization reads @xmath43 and the conjugate transpose matrix is @xmath44    one can see that the obtained discrete density matrix @xmath38 is a result of action by the nonlinear positive map of the continuous matrix @xmath45 satisfying the same properties as a standard density matrix , i.e. , is a hermitian , positive , semi - definite one with @xmath46 .",
    "thus , information on the initial continuous matrix can be obtained through information on the discrete density matrix obtained by means of the positive map .",
    "the partial density matrices for the system can be calculated as @xmath47 where as in ( [ d1 ] ) we now use @xmath48 with @xmath49 ; for the first mode @xmath50 , while for the second one @xmath51 .",
    "one has the following discrete normalization condition : @xmath52    we choose the interval @xmath53 in the sum form of the integral providing that @xmath54 .",
    "this discrete form @xmath55 is a nonlinear positive map of the reduced density matrix for the system , which can be used to calculate all the observables , such as , for example , the entanglement entropies  @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath56 for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is arbitrarily small .",
    "then the infinite matrix @xmath59 has the approximation @xmath60 where @xmath59 has an _ ocean of zeros_. for all the reduced density matrices @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 , the discretization procedure provides the infinite matrix @xmath59 , which has the form of an _ island _ finite @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrix ( @xmath63 ) floating in the infinity ocean of zero matrix elements .",
    "thus we have mapped the infinite matrix onto a finite @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 density matrix .    to give an example of such maps , we discuss a nonlinear positive map , which transforms an @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 finite density matrix onto a @xmath22@xmath17@xmath22 density matrix with @xmath23 . the initial @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 density matrix @xmath10 for mode  1 has the matrix elements @xmath64 let us construct the matrix @xmath65 following the rule that all the matrix elements @xmath66 with @xmath67 are equal to zero .",
    "let the matrix elements @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 be equal to @xmath71 .",
    "then the @xmath22@xmath17@xmath22 matrix reads @xmath72 it has the properties @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we constructed the positive map @xmath76 .",
    "an analogous construction can be done by taking the odd matrix elements equal to zero , whose map can be denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "if the @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrix @xmath19 is large enough , one has the equalities of the von neumann and linear entropies , @xmath78 the same procedure can be applied to the density matrix of the bipartite system @xmath79 .",
    "we only need to change the indices @xmath80 by @xmath81 and @xmath82 by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , and consider the odd or even matrix elements as zeros , and so on .",
    "the entanglement properties of the state @xmath85 are again preserved for the matrices @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "one can check that global criteria as the logarithmic negativity for the discretized matrices reflect the phenomenon of entanglement .",
    "the discussed example of density @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrices ( with even number @xmath88 ) mapped on smaller density @xmath22@xmath17@xmath22 matrices is a particular case of specific nonlinear positive maps .",
    "below we describe such maps , which we call cut maps ; they are constructed as follows .",
    "first , we consider an arbitrary @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrix @xmath14 ( not only the density matrix ) with matrix elements @xmath89 , @xmath90 then , we construct @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrix @xmath91 , where arbitrary @xmath92th columns and rows ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) are replaced by columns and rows with zero matrix elements .",
    "the new matrix @xmath95 reads @xmath96 and we assume that @xmath97 .    for example , by this prescription , the 3@xmath173 matrix @xmath98 yields the matrices @xmath99 with five zero matrix elements .",
    "three other 3@xmath173 matrices , which we can obtain by replacing two columns and rows with zero matrix elements with applying the renormalization tool , are @xmath100 we can consider this prescription as a map of 3@xmath173 matrix @xmath14 onto 2@xmath172 matrices just by removing all zero columns and rows in matrices  ( [ 2 ] ) , i.e. , maps of 3@xmath173 matrix @xmath14 onto three matrices @xmath101 due to this procedure , matrices  ( [ 3 ] ) convert just to the identity 1@xmath171 matrix .",
    "in fact , the procedure we employed is equivalent to cutting some @xmath92th columns and rows ( @xmath102 ) in the initial matrix @xmath14 accompanied by the normalization ( dividing by the trace of the matrix obtained ) .",
    "the map under discussion is a nonlinear map of the initial @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrix on the @xmath22@xmath17@xmath22 matrices , where @xmath22 is an arbitrary integer , such that @xmath23 .",
    "this map is such that in cases , where the matrix @xmath14 has the properties of the density matrix , i.e. , @xmath103 , with @xmath104 , tr@xmath105 , and @xmath106 , the cut map preserves all of them .",
    "for example , if we consider the 3@xmath173 matrix @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the density matrix of the qutrit state ( spin @xmath109 state ) , we obtain the density matrices of the qubit state ( spin @xmath110 state ) , i.e. , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 it is worth noting that the hermiticity , normalization , and nonnegativity conditions of the matrices obtained are obvious .",
    "in fact , the sylvester criterion of non - negativity for the qubit density matrices , obtained by using the cut map , is fulfilled since all the principal minors of the qubit matrices coincide ( up to positive normalization factor ) with a part of principal minors of the initial matrix @xmath10 . by induction , this property can be checked for an arbitrary @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 density matrix @xmath10 .",
    "one can describe all cut maps for the density operator , acting in the @xmath16-dimensional hilbert space @xmath115 , @xmath116 of the system state by the relation @xmath117 where @xmath118 is ( @xmath119)-rank projector @xmath120 , @xmath121 , tr@xmath122 , with @xmath21 being the integer such that @xmath123 .",
    "projector @xmath118 in ( [ 6 ] ) has only diagonal matrix elements different from zero .",
    "we discussed the cut maps of density matrices since the properties of the initial matrix @xmath14 are partially preserved after applying the map and obtaining the matrix @xmath95 . due to this fact",
    ", such phenomenon as the entanglement and other quantum correlation properties can be studied using the smaller density @xmath22@xmath17@xmath22 matrix @xmath124 obtained from the initial density matrix .",
    "the conservation of the properties of the density matrices can be characterized by using either the difference of the von neumann entropies , @xmath125 or the difference of the tsallis entropies of matrices @xmath10 and @xmath124 , @xmath126 also relative @xmath127-entropy @xmath128 and relative von neumann entropy  @xcite @xmath129 characterize a degree of the preservation of the properties of quantum correlations after applying the cut map to the initial density matrix @xmath10 .    in formulas  ( [ 7])([10 ] ) , the matrix @xmath124 is the @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrix with zero matrix elements in the columns and rows corresponding to the action of @xmath130-rank projector @xmath118 .",
    "the nonnegativity of the matrix @xmath124 follows from the positivity of the initial matrix @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , the nonnegativity of the density operator @xmath131 acting in the hilbert space @xmath115 means that for an arbitrary state vector @xmath132 one has the inequality @xmath133 from which follows that @xmath134 is valid for an arbitrary vector @xmath132 , since for the vector @xmath135 one has @xmath136 .",
    "this proof is coherent with the application of the sylvester criterion discussed above to the matrix representation of the density operator @xmath137 for the qutrit state .    for continuous variables ,",
    "the density matrix @xmath138 is infinite dimensional .",
    "typically , the function of variables @xmath139 and @xmath140 is the continuous function . in view of this fact ,",
    "the values of the function in coordinates @xmath141 change a little in points @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "thus , the discretization procedure of the continuous density matrix does not change the properties of quantum correlations , if there is no singular behavior of the function derivatives , or if the shifts of the arguments ( steps of the discretization ) are not large .",
    "in the case of finite @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrices , if one cuts uniformly columns and rows in the matrix @xmath10 using the small shifts between them , the correlation properties of the obtained matrix @xmath144 do not change essentially .",
    "this happens if the dependence of the matrix elements of the initial matrix @xmath108 on the indices @xmath145 and @xmath92 is smooth enough . in our study",
    ", we address the problems of application of cut maps in such cases .    as for the case of bipartite - system states , the density @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16 matrix @xmath108 at @xmath18",
    "is interpreted as the matrix with combined indices @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "after this , there appears the possibility to obtain maps to the density matrix of the first subsystem @xmath150 and to the density matrix of the second subsystem @xmath151 .",
    "the cut map applied to the initial matrix @xmath152 induces cut maps of the subsystem density matrices @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the obtained matrices @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 preserve some information on the initial density matrices @xmath10 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , among other things the correlation properties of the subsystem degrees of freedom , including information on entanglement .    in our study , we focused on the properties of initial density matrices of continuous variables .",
    "obviously , after the first cut map , we obtained the finite matrix @xmath158 , with @xmath145 and @xmath92 combined indices , from the matrix @xmath159 .",
    "the following maps are equivalent to the initial cut map with larger steps of discretization .",
    "to show the procedure of discretization , we apply this method to the squeezed vacuum state that has the continuous variable bipartite representation in variables @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "we determine the dynamics of some entanglement measurements as the von neumann , linear and tsallis entropies and the logarithmic negativity for the two - mode squeezed vacuum state in the parametric amplifier .",
    "the squeezed vacuum state is a gaussian two - mode state .",
    "it is known that a two - mode gaussian state remains the gaussian one after the evolution due to a quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "the analytical results for the linear and von neumann entropies of any two - mode gaussian density matrix can be obtained using the wigner function  @xcite and the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix  @xcite .",
    "the symplectic eigenvalues can also be used to calculate the logarithmic negativity  @xcite .",
