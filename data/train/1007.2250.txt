    "lorentz symmetries , together with the cpt theorem [ 1 ] ( a well known property of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics ) are important for understanding the phenomena that occur within the quantum theory .",
    "however the lorentz symmetry is broken in an attempt to incorporate the theory of general relativity to the sm .",
    "an initial idea for a possible theory of lorentz symmetry breaking appeared in an work of kosteleck and samuel [ 2 ] . in this study",
    ", the authors argue that such violation can be extended to the sm .",
    "then , in the second half of 1990 , there is the standard model extension ( sme ) .",
    "the sme is a theory that has all the usual sm s properties - such as the structure gauge @xmath0 and renormalizability - and the extension that allows for violations of lorentz and cpt symmetries .",
    "this theory then provides a quantitative description of the violations of lorentz and cpt symmetries , controlled by coefficients whose values are determined by especific experiments . a striking feature of this theory ,",
    "as is known from literature , is that the symmetry breaking cpt implies lorentz breaking symmetry [ 3 ] .",
    "this fact means that any observable violation of cpt symmetry is described by the sme . in reference",
    "[ 4 ] a theoretical basis to perform perturbative calculations in this theory , via fermion sector , can be found .    in the early 80s , s. deser , r. jackiw and s. templeton [ 7 ] wrote to maxwell s electromagnetic theory in a planar variant in ( 2 + 1)@xmath1 , which preserves lorentz invariance and gauge transformations .",
    "this model , called the theory of maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) , has applicability to planar condensed matter phenomena , with great emphasis in the literature to superconductors and the fractional quantum hall effect [ 8 ] .",
    "however , in a 1990 work , carroll , field and jackiw realized in a pioneering work [ 9 ] , it is possible to formulate a similar theory in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions , by adding the action @xmath2 to the conventional maxwell action .",
    "this term is known in literature as carroll - field - jackiw term .",
    "this term is cpt - odd .",
    "although gauge transformations be preserved , the lorentz symmetry is violated , because it is necessary to engage the end type chern - simons ( cs ) @xmath3 a constant four - vector , which produces an anisotropy of space - time .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the radiative corrections in the approximation of a loop , from the axial coupling of fermions with a gauge field in the presence of lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "this coupling generates an induction of a term similar to cs [ 10 ] , as in equation ( 1 ) , in the action of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the induction is ambiguous , since the proportionality between the fields of matter and radiation depends exclusively on the regularization scheme adopted ( such schemes can be : dimensional regularization , pauli - villars [ 17 ] regularization , the method of cut - off [ 24 ] and the schwinger propper time method [ 21 ] ) . thus , we calculate the term induced by the method of dimensional regularization .",
    "the calculations are performed in a clear way , since the articles on the subject in the literature are difficult to understand and the calculations are very tedious .",
    "this is the main goal of this work .",
    "the fermion propagator dependent of lorentz symmetry breaking [ 4 ] is given by @xmath4    the above inverted propagator is represented by [ 16 ] @xmath5\\gamma_5 \\}}{(p^2-b^2-m^2)^2 - 4(p\\cdot b)^2 + 4p^2b^2}\\,.\\ ] ]    this propagator has a complicated structure and make it more tedious perturbative calculations ( exact perturbative calculations with this propagator can be found in reference [ 16 ] ) .",
    "we will not use this propagator , but we will draw on an alternative method . as the four - vector @xmath6 , which signals the lorentz breaking symmetry in the theory , is very small compared to the electron mass , the correction he made in the propagator can be treated in perturbative way .",
