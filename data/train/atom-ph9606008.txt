    "progress in many plasma physics fields ( such as kinetics of incompletely ionized plasmas , radiative hydrodynamics of non - equilibrium plasmas , interpretation of spectroscopic measurements , etc . ) depends on availability and accuracy of electron - ion inelastic collision cross sections . in this paper",
    "we present high - accuracy cross sections for electron - impact - induced transitions between @xmath12-states of some hydrogen - like ions , namely , for transitions @xmath11 with @xmath13 in ions @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the cross sections are denoted by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ion nuclear charge , @xmath12 and @xmath17 are the principal quantum numbers of initial and final states respectively ( @xmath18 ) , and    @xmath19 is the ratio of the incident electron kinetic energy @xmath20to transition energy @xmath21 .",
    "the cross sections are computed by the coulomb - born with exchange and normalization ( cbe ) method @xcite and by the convergent close - coupling ( ccc ) method @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present and compare the ccc and cbe cross sections together with earlier close - coupling ( cc ) results @xcite .",
    "however , the cc cross sections are published for transition @xmath22 only .",
    "we do not include comparisons with broad - energy - range cross sections calculated by less accurate methods ( for assessment of theoretical data sources see papers by pradhan and gallagher @xcite and callaway@xcite ) .",
    "for use in applications , sec .",
    "iii contains a table of coefficients which provide good analytical fit to all @xmath11 cross sections discussed in sec .",
    "two semiempirical formulae for the cross section estimates are discussed in sections iv and v.",
    "the cbe cross sections were calculated by computer code atom @xcite . _  _ in this code , the exchange is accounted by method of orthogonalized functions and the normalization is done by k - matrix method using one own channel @xcite .",
    "being installed on a personal computer , code atom provides dozens of cross sections per day .    the ccc method is presented in refs .",
    "the basic idea of the ccc approach to electron - atom and electron - ion collisions is to solve the coupled equations arising upon expansion of the total wave function in a truncated laguerre basis of size @xmath23 .",
    "this basis size is increased until convergence to a desired accuracy is observed .",
    "the usage of the laguerre basis ensures that all states in the expansion are square - integrable , and so gives a discretization of the target continuum as well as a good representation of the target true discrete spectrum . for a sufficiently large @xmath23 pseudoresonances , associated with the target continuum discretization , diminish substantially so that no averaging is necessary .",
    "the presented ccc calculations at all given energies are likely to be within 10% of the true non - relativistic model solution for the considered scattering systems . in general",
    ", the ccc method demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental results available for various targets @xcite .",
    "the ccc and cbe computer codes produce cross sections for @xmath24 transitions .",
    "these cross sections are denoted below by @xmath25 . to obtain the cross sections for the @xmath11 transitions,@xmath26partial cross sections @xmath27",
    "are summed over @xmath28 and averaged over @xmath29 : @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 are statistical weights of states @xmath34 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "statistical averaging over @xmath29 ( which is reflected by the factor @xmath35 ) is caused by uncertainty of @xmath29 in initial quantum state given by @xmath12 only .",
    "summation over @xmath28 ensures inclusion of all possible final states for a given @xmath17 of interest .    the cross sections @xmath15 are presented in figs .",
    "one can see : ( i ) the cbe cross sections for all transitions with @xmath5 in ions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 ; ( ii ) the ccc cross sections for all transitions with @xmath6 in ions",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath7 ; and ( iii ) the cc results available for transition @xmath22 in ions @xmath1 , @xmath37 , @xmath4 and @xmath38 @xcite . to emphasize the scaling of the cross sections over @xmath39 , we present scaled cross sections @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    "these are independent of @xmath16 to an accuracy better than 1% .",
    "for @xmath42 there is a weak dependence on @xmath16 which results in small deviations from the scaling .",
    "these deviations are to within @xmath43 for @xmath44 and to within @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( except for transition @xmath47 in @xmath1 which deviates by 17% at @xmath48 ) . in present paper",
    "we limit our consideration by @xmath49 but it should be mentioned that for @xmath50 deviations from the @xmath51-scaling are more significant , for example : @xmath52 for transition @xmath22 in @xmath53 and a factor of 3 for transition @xmath54 in @xmath53 .    to see the difference between ccc , cc , and cbe results with no influence of @xmath55scaling , one may compare the cross sections related to the same ion .",
    "however , the data available enables to compare the three approximations for a single transition only , namely , for transition @xmath22 in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for this transition",
    "the ccc , cc , and cbe cross sections deviate from each other by less than @xmath56 . generally , the ccc and cbe cross sections of any transition studied deviate from each other by less than @xmath57 note , that in present work we do not compare broad  energy - range cross sections to cross sections computed exclusively for narrow energy intervals where contributions of resonances are significant ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "such fine detail is not necessary for the purpose of most applications .",
    "figs . 9 and 10",
    "demonstrate excellent agreement between the ccc , cc , and cbe results for both monopole ( @xmath58 ) and dipole ( @xmath59 ) channels contributing to transition @xmath22 . at @xmath60 ,",
    "cross section @xmath9 is larger than @xmath8 by a factor of 4 ; with @xmath61 the cross section @xmath9 goes down slower than @xmath8 ( namely , as @xmath62ln@xmath61 vs. @xmath62 ) , therefore the @xmath22 cross section is almost exclusively due to the dipole channel . in general , in double sums ( 1 ) contributions from dipole transitions dominate over contributions from non - dipole ones .",
    "therefore , properties of non - dipole cross sections are practically indistinguishable in total cross sections @xmath15 .",
    "properties of partial cross sections @xmath25 will be discussed in separate paper @xcite which , in particular , demonstrates ( i ) strong effect of electron exchange for energy range @xmath63 , and ( ii ) an increase of this effect with multipole order @xmath64 .",
    "to simplify a use of the cross sections in applications , we fitted them by analytical function . taking account for the @xmath65scaling and analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite the fitting function is chosen to be    @xmath66    here @xmath67 is the bohr radius .",
    "coefficients @xmath68and @xmath69 are listed in table 1 .",
    "the fitting function @xmath70 provides an accuracy to better than 10% for any @xmath61 for all transitions studied ( @xmath71 ) except for transition @xmath47 in @xmath1 . for this transition ,",
    "the fit is less accurate because at @xmath48 the cross section deviates by @xmath72 from total scaling over @xmath51 ( fig . 8) .",
    "expression ( 2 ) may be used in applications which require high accuracy of the cross sections . for estimates , it is desirable to have a simpler expression which does not use a table of coefficients . frequently , such estimates are based on the van regemorter formula @xcite . for transitions between @xmath12-states this formula",
    "may be presented as follows    @xmath73    here @xmath74is the absorption oscillator strength , @xmath75 @xmath76 ev is the rydberg energy unit , and @xmath77is the effective gaunt factor which may be treated as a fitting function of order unity .    to find an accurate expression for the @xmath12-independent function @xmath78",
    "we first use fitting function ( 2 ) and eq .",
    "( 3 ) to introduce the gaunt factor @xmath79 for each of transitions studied : @xmath80 these gaunt factors for all transitions with @xmath13 are shown by dotted curves in fig .",
    "the curves are not labeled because they are shown only for demonstrating the small spread of functions @xmath81 near their mean function @xmath82 which is shown by bold solid curve .",
    "we recommend function ( 4 ) as effective gaunt factor for the van regemorter formula ( 3 ) .",
    "bold dot - dash curves in fig .",
    "11 show @xmath8350% corridor around this @xmath84 one can see that for @xmath60 some dotted curves deviate from @xmath85 by more than a factor of 2 , but for @xmath86 a spread of dotted curves is smaller ( to within @xmath8350% ) , and for @xmath87 the spread is to within 20% .",
    "the van regemorter formula ( 3 ) is most accurate for @xmath88 therefore , this formula fits applications which require accurate account of suprathermal electrons ( e.g. , pulsed power devices , subpicosecond lasers , solar flares ) .",
    "however , there are non - maxwellian plasmas with overpopulated low - energy part of the electron distribution function , e.g. , plasmas produced by uhf devices or by lasers with non - relativistic intensity of radiation ( for our example , it is enough to have a free electron oscillation energy less than mean energy of the electron chaotic motion ) .",
    "estimates of kinetic coefficients for such plasmas require cross sections accurate in low - energy range ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "semiempirical formula suitable for this case was suggested by vainshtein , sobelman , and yukov @xcite .",
    "we rewrite it as follows @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the optical electron binding energy and @xmath92 is the fitting function which provides good fit to cc , ccc , and cbe cross sections discussed above .",
    "being interested in an easy - to - use formula , we looked for function @xmath93 independent on @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath17 although initially @xcite functions @xmath93 were fitted to each of the transition studied .",
    "using the expression @xmath94 for the binding energy , formula ( 5 ) may be presented as follows    @xmath95 ^{-2}\\frac{f(x)}x .",
    "\\label{7}\\ ] ]    function ( 6 ) is shown by bold solid curve in fig .",
    "dotted curves demonstrate functions @xmath96 obtained by replacing @xmath97 in expression ( 7 ) by functions ( 2 ) :    @xmath98 ^2}{n^7\\sqrt{n^{\\prime } } } .\\ ] ] these dotted curves are not labeled because they are shown only for demonstrating their small deviation from function @xmath93 .",
    "bold dash curves show @xmath8330% corridor around @xmath93 while bold dot - dash curves show @xmath8350% corridor .",
    "one can see that for @xmath99 the vsy formula is accurate to within 30% . for @xmath89",
    "this formula is accurate to within 50% . for larger electron energy ( @xmath100 ) ,",
    "estimates of the cross sections are more accurate if based on the van regemorter formula ( 3 ) .",
    "we have presented ccc and cbe cross sections for electron - impact - induced transitions @xmath11 in hydrogen - like ions @xmath1 , @xmath101 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 ( @xmath102 ) .    with coefficients given in table 1 , expression ( 2 ) fits all cc , ccc , and cbe cross sections available for @xmath71 to better than 10% , except for transition @xmath54 in @xmath1 which deviates from total @xmath51-scaling by 17% .    in general ,",
    "a scaling of the cross sections over @xmath51 is accurate to within a few percent for ions with large nuclear charge ( @xmath103 but for ions with @xmath104 a deviation from the scaling is significant ( at @xmath42 ) .",
    "for @xmath41 the @xmath51-scaling is accurate for all ions and transitions . for each @xmath105",
    "the accuracy of the scaling is higher for larger transition energy .",
    "semiempirical formulae ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) together provide an accuracy to within 50% for any energy : for @xmath99 the vsy formula ( 7 ) is accurate to within 30% ; for @xmath106 this formula is accurate to within 50% ; for @xmath100 an accuracy to better than 50% is provided by the van regemorter formula ( 3 ) .",
