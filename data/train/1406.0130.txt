    "to study the nature of the percolation process @xcite , much attention has been paid to correlation functions @xmath17 describing the probability that @xmath18 points @xmath19 belong to the same cluster . for example , the mean cluster size can be calculated as @xmath20 , and a recent work investigated the factorization of the three - point correlation function in terms of two - point correlations @xcite . while most results in the literature deal with long - range correlations @xcite , the present work is dedicated to the investigation of short - range correlations , over distances comparable with the lattice spacing .    it is well known that the bond - percolation model can be considered as the @xmath21 limit of the @xmath22-state potts model @xcite . for a lattice @xmath23 with a set of edges denoted as @xmath24 , the reduced hamiltonian ( i.e. , divided by @xmath25 ) of the potts model reads @xmath26 where the sum is over all nearest - neighbor lattice edges @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 is the energy of a neighbor pair . the celebrated kasteleyn - fortuin transformation @xcite maps the potts model onto the random - cluster ( rc ) model with partition sum @xmath30 where the sum is over all subgraphs @xmath31 of @xmath23",
    ", @xmath32 is the number of occupied bonds in @xmath31 , and @xmath33 is the number of connected components ( clusters ) .",
    "the rc model generalizes the potts model to non - integer values @xmath34 , and in the limit @xmath35 it reduces to the bond - percolation @xcite model , in which bonds are uncorrelated , and governed by independent probabilities @xmath36 . as a result",
    ", the critical _ thermal _ fluctuations are suppressed in this model , so that the critical finite - size - scaling ( fss ) amplitudes of many energy - like quantities vanish .",
    "for instance , the density of the occupied bonds is independent of the system size , and the density of clusters converges rapidly to its background value with zero amplitude for the leading finite - size term with @xmath15 in the exponent @xcite . though the partition function at @xmath37 reduces to a trivial power of @xmath38 , a number of nontrivial properties of the percolation model can be derived from the rc model via differentiation of the rc partition sum to @xmath22 , and then taking the limit @xmath35 .",
    "quantities of interest can then be numerically determined by sampling the resulting expression from monte carlo generated percolation configurations .",
    "an example is given in appendix  [ percsph ] , where we display the behavior of the rc specific heat in the percolation limit @xmath39 as a function of temperature .",
    "making use of existing results on the critical temperature and energy of the potts model @xcite , in the limit @xmath40 , we derive analytically the critical nearest - neighbor connectivity @xmath0 as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for bond percolation on the square , honeycomb and triangular lattices , respectively , where @xmath4 is the percolation threshold for the triangular lattice , and confirm them with monte carlo simulations . for bond percolation on the square lattice , we also determine numerically the critical next - nearest - neighbor connectivity as @xmath5 which is very close to @xmath41 .",
    "our transfer - matrix calculations ( appendix  [ tmcal ] ) , which apply to a cylindrical geometry , are consistent with this value .",
    "as explained in appendix  [ appmapping ] , @xmath42 is related to a quantity for the completely packed @xmath43 loop model which has been studied by mitra et al .",
    "they formulated a conjecture implying the exact value @xmath6 .",
    "our results support that this conjecture holds exactly .",
    "furthermore we determined the connectivity on free one - dimensional surfaces of the square lattice as @xmath7 , and conjecture that this value is exactly equal to @xmath8 .",
    "we are also interested in the critical fss behavior of the connectivities @xmath0 and @xmath42 , as well as the associated specific - heat - like quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "numerical simulations and finite - size analysis were done for square , triangular , honeycomb and simple - cubic lattices .",
    "it is found that , at criticality , one has @xmath44",
    "( @xmath14 is the spatial dimensionality ) , where @xmath45 accounts for the background contribution and the amplitude @xmath46 for the singular part is non - zero . in two and three dimensions , this critical exponent is known as @xmath47 @xcite and @xmath48 @xcite , respectively . for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "it is observed that the leading @xmath49-dependent term with exponent 2@xmath50 also exists .",
    "moreover , it is found that this leading term is modified by a multiplicative logarithmic factor such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are proportional to @xmath51 , where @xmath16 is non - universal .    the logarithmic factor mentioned above",
    "can be related with recently identified logarithmic observables that were explained by mixing the energy operator with an operator connecting two random clusters @xcite .",
    "the latter operator is associated with a change of the bond probability @xmath52 @xcite between potts spins , while the potts coupling @xmath53 remains constant . for @xmath39",

    "2 .   _ specific - heat - like quantities _ : * @xmath67 . * @xmath12 , defined analogously as @xmath11 for the next - nearest neighbors .",
    "the analysis of the sampled quantities , obtained by numerical simulation of the percolation model , is based on fss predictions . to obtain these predictions ,",
    "one first expresses these quantities in terms of the derivatives of the free - energy density @xmath68 of the random - cluster model with respect to the thermal field @xmath69 , the magnetic field @xmath70 , or the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "then , one applies the scaling relation for the free - energy density @xmath71 , which is @xmath72 where the irrelevant scaling fields have been neglected , @xmath73 denotes the regular part of the free - energy density , and @xmath74 is the singular part .",
    "the thermal scaling field @xmath69 is approximately proportional to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the critical value of @xmath38 .",
    "differentiation of the partition sum  ( [ zrc ] ) with respect to @xmath38 at the critical point shows that @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the bond density in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the latter pairs thus contribute a second term @xmath89 to the bond density .",

    "( [ eq : scaling - rhob ] ) and ( [ rhob - gn ] ) that , at criticality @xmath92 , @xmath0 is given by @xmath93 one expects that this expression remains valid for non - integer values of @xmath22 .",

    ", it is sufficient to linearize the amplitude @xmath79 as @xmath95 which yields : @xmath96 where the amplitude @xmath97 takes a nonzero value @xmath98 .",
    "the above equation expresses that , in spite of the suppression of the critical thermal fluctuations , @xmath81 does display a singular dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "similar fss behavior is expected for @xmath99 .",
    "for the specific - heat like quantities @xmath11 and",
