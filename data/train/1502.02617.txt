    "wave breaking is one of the most complex phenomena that occurs in the near shore region . during propagation of wave from deep to shallow water",
    ", the wave field is transformed due to shoaling .",
    "close to the shoreline , they become unstable and break . in the process of breaking",
    ", energy is redistributed from fairly organized wave motion to small scale turbulence , large scale currents and waves .",
    "+ classical boussinesq theory provides a set of evolution equations for sueface water waves in the combined limit of weak nonlinearity ( characterized by @xmath0 ) and weak dispersion ( @xmath1 ) with the raio @xmath2 .",
    "the parameters represent a wave height to water deth ratio and a water depth to wavelength ratio , respectively .",
    "+ it has been shown by numerous researchers that boussinesq - type equations for varying water depth can describe nonlinear transformation in the shoaling region quite well . in the last couple of decades , a lot of research effort has gone into improving the predictive capability of these equations in the intermediate water - depth and close to the surf zone ( see e.g. nwogu @xcite , madsen @xcite , wei @xcite ) .",
    "it was established that to extend the validity of these equations to the deep water , higher order dispersive terms will have to be retained . to improve the predictive capability close to wave breaking , the higher order nonlinear terms are very important to include in the equation .",
    "however , all these models use additional terms that is artificially added to the momentum equation , which would then reproduce the main characteristic of a breaking wave , i.e. the reduction in wave height to describe wave breaking phenomena .",
    "wave breaking in the software funwave ( funwave is based on the model described by nwogu @xcite ) is modeled by introducing momentum mixing term developed by kennedy et al @xcite .",
    "+ starting with the works of nwogu @xcite and madsen @xcite , most progress have been done to explain wave breaking phenomena .",
    "shen @xcite addresses the problem with partially rotational flow .",
    "vorticity dynamics and formation into the fluid is very important in the wave breaking as well surf zone . to address this problem ,",
    "veeramony & svendsen @xcite derived breaking terms in boussinesq equation assuming flow as a two - dimensional rotational flow . here",
    ", the breaking process is modeled by assuming that vorticity is generated in the roller region of the breaking wave and solving vorticity transport equation to determine the distribution of the vorticity .",
    "this naturally introduces additional terms in the momentum equation which causes wave height reduction as well as changes in the velocity field .",
    "however , since this model is based on stream function formulation , it can not be trivially extended to three - dimensional flow .",
    "the phenomena of wave breaking in boussinesq equations are being modeled using quite few techniques which can preserve the wave shape as well as include energy dissipation mechanism .",
    "shen @xcite developed a generalized form of bousinesq equation in three dimensional by introducing vertical flow field with arbitrary vorticity distribution up to o(@xmath3 .",
    "but he did not describe momentum transport equation with full description of rotational flow .",
    "recently , zou et al @xcite addressed the problem by including the higher order terms in boussinesq equation for two dimensinal flow .",
    "this model solves vorticity distribution based on the parametric form taken form surface roller experimental data . in this paper",
    ", we developed a general analytic form for breaking term for fully nonlinear set of boussinesq equations for three dimensional vertical flow field near surf zone region .",
    "derivation of breaking term from reynold stress based vorticity transport equation was also developed to describe rotational field as a complete model for thorough understanding of wave breaking phenomena .",
    "+ the term nonlinear indicates that no truncation based on powers of @xmath4 is employed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 discusses the basic governing equations for continuity and momentum with boundary conditions .",
    "section 3 describes the equation for horizontal and vertical velocity distribution for potential and rotational components . in section 4 ,",
    "the breaking term is derived for velocity transport equation for fully nonlinear case and solved analytic form vorticity transport equation from fourier series expansion .",
    "reynold stresses are analyzed in the breaking region . in last section , results were discussed with conclusion . a parametric analysis of the role eddy viscosity profile is being discussed in detail .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional wave field with free surface @xmath5 propagating over a variable water depth @xmath6 .",
    "as we are primarily concerned with wave breaking , we only consider here wave propagation in shallow water .",
    "wave in this region can be characterized by two non - dimensional parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the characteristic wave amplitude and @xmath10 the characteristic wave length .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is a measure of frequency dispersion and @xmath4 that of the non linearity of the wave . in this study , since we are only considering shallow water waves , we only have to consider weakly dispersive waves ( up to @xmath12 ) but have to retain all nonlinear terms . in this paper ,",
    "the variables are non - dimensionalized using following scaling : @xmath13 where the @xmath14 represents the dimensional variables , @xmath15 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the horizontal components of the velocity in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions respectively , @xmath20 is the vertical velocity .",
    "we start with the eulerian equations of continuity and momentum in nondimensionalized form for velocity field @xmath21 as : @xmath22    since the fluid flow is rotational , we also have three dimensional vorticity field @xmath23 in the fluid defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 the continuity equation then becomes , @xmath26 here @xmath27 the above equations satisfy two boundary conditions for velocity at bottom and at free surface . at the free surface @xmath28 , since particles are free to move with fluid velocity , the kinematic boundary condition is @xmath29and at bottom @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is two component horizontal surface velocity .",
    "@xmath34 refer to horizontal derivative with respect to x and y in all subsequent calculations .",
    "the horizontal component for vorticity field @xmath35 can be described as , @xmath36 with @xmath37 as two component horizontal field whereas vertical component of vorticity expressed as @xmath38 this is straightforward calculation from equation ( 6 ) and ( 8) which is the beginning equation in three dimensional vorticity field formulation .",
    "@xmath39 @xmath20 represents the vertical velocity of the flow . in the above equation ,",
    "once @xmath20 solved , horizontal component of velocity @xmath40 can be solved from vorticity relation . in weakly",
    "hydro static case ( @xmath41 ) , solution is typically obtained from iterative perturbation procedure with successive correction term up to @xmath42 .    in case of breaking waves where vorticity is very strong , so @xmath43 we assume solution as , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for horizontal and vertical velocity component . under this assumption , poisson equation becomes @xmath46 @xmath47\\ ] ] @xmath48 , @xmath49 can be calculated from bottom boundary conditions using equation ( 7 ) separately where the boundary conditions are , @xmath50 at bottom boundary _ z = -h _ .",
    "+ since at any other depth @xmath51 , w is constrained by continuity equation only , so the equation follows @xmath52 where @xmath53 is velocity at any arbitrary depth @xmath54 . in boussinesq equation , one may take depth average or any intermediate velocity for horizontal velocity between bottom and free surface as reference velocity . in the wave breaking zone where the vorticity is developed non uniformly , the equations become simpler with the choice of depth average velocity which includes contribution from surface vorticity gradient .",
    "we assume solution for velocity comes also from rotational contribution due to vorticity at the wave surface .",
    "so the velocity has both potential as well as rotational component , @xmath55 , @xmath56 + we solve @xmath57 and @xmath58 at any depth @xmath59 @xmath60_{z } } _ { r } = - { \\bf \\bigtriangledown } \\cdot ( u_{m }    - z_{r }   s { \\rbrack _ { z } } _ { r } ) + z _ { r }    { \\bf \\bigtriangledown } \\cdot s\\ ] ] @xmath61 @xmath62 with boundary condition @xmath63 and @xmath64 + equations ( 4 ) - ( 16 ) form basic shallow water boussinesq equations .",
    "in the surf zone , vorticity grows very strongly as a non uniform function over depth . following shen [ 2000 ] , we define reference velocity as @xmath65 in terms of depth average velocity @xmath66 and magnitude of vorticity at free surface @xmath67 with the assumption of @xmath68 .",
    "we set here @xmath69 as linear calibration for @xmath70 does not hold here in presence of nonuniform velocity as wave dispersion properties change both spatially and temporally with vorticity . and boundary condition can be set as @xmath71 integrating equation ( 9 ) from bottom to surface and applying boundary condition to ( 16 ) we get @xmath72 as , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the vertical velocity distribution generated by horizontal divergence of vorticity added to surface velocity .",
    "now , once @xmath75 is calculated , @xmath76 can be calculated from eqn ( 15 ) with surface boundary condition @xmath77 and @xmath78 finally , we calculate horizontal velocity as @xmath79   + o(\\mu^{\\rm 4 } ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] which on averaging over depth yields , @xmath80   -   \\cfrac{\\mu^{\\rm 2}}{2 } h_{\\rm \\eta }   [ { \\bigtriangledown }   \\tilde{u } + { \\eta } s_{\\rm \\eta } ] \\cdot{\\bigtriangledown}h \\\\ - ( { \\bigtriangledown } \\cdot \\tilde{u } - { \\eta}{\\bigtriangledown } \\cdot s_{\\rm \\eta}){\\bigtriangledown } h   + o(\\mu^{\\rm 4 } ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath81 is the average surface velocity contribution due to vorticity and it is significant for suspended sediment particles in the flow .",

    "the most obvious approach to solve boussinesq equation is to drop notion of pursuing an expansion in powers of @xmath4 and instead use weakly dispersive expression for @xmath94 or horizontal velocity in the form of power series in @xmath95 to evaluate complete surface boundary condition .",

    "shen @xcite addressed problems in developing generalized three dimensional irrotational propagating wave field to include rotational motion in general but did not describe the vorticity breaking terms . for horizontal propagation of waves ,",
    "the three dimensional problem can be reduced in terms of two horizontal velocity by integrating over depth and retaining up to order @xmath99 and @xmath100 as horizontal velocity is governed by momentum equation at the surface @xmath101 by , @xmath102    in the surf zone region of sloping beach , waves break due to high vorticity and the breaking of wave later being converted to turbulence .",
    "so horizontal variation of water depth @xmath103 must be considered in this case .",
