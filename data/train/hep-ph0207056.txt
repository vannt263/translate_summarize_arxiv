    "particle physics currently finds itself in the perplexing situation in which most experimental results conform to the expectations of the standard model ( sm ) , but leave many theoretical questions unanswered .",
    "for example , the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking is currently unverified , and the mystery as to why the weak scale is so much smaller than the planck scale remains unanswered . the spectrum of quark masses and mixings has been experimentally determined , and progress is being made on the corresponding quantities for the leptons , but no clues as to why the pattern observed shows large hierarchies in masses and mixings have been established .",
    "extra compact dimensions allow for novel solutions to these ( and other ) mysteries . by diluting gravity in a ( relatively ) large volume which gauge fields and matter can not enter , one can lower the fundamental planck scale to just above the weak scale , ameliorating the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "there also exist compelling reasons to consider gauge fields which may propagate into extra dimensions .",
    "having the gauge fields in the bulk may allow one to address questions as to why low - scale gravitational effects do not cause unacceptably fast proton decay @xcite , pursue a geometric origin for the observed spectrum of fermion masses @xcite , naturally break the electroweak symmetry through strong dynamics @xcite , identify the higgs as an extra - dimensional component of the gauge field thus protecting its mass from large corrections @xcite , achieve gauge coupling unification at high scales @xcite , provide a viable dark matter candidate @xcite , and can provide interesting alternatives to gut symmetry - breaking and associated problems such as the higgs doublet - triplet splitting problem @xcite .",
    "provided the compactification scale , related to the size of the extra dimension by @xmath0 , is not much larger than 1 tev , interesting collider signatures involving production of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the gauge fields through the scattering of either brane - localized matter @xcite or bulk matter @xcite fields may be obtained .",
    "models with gauge fields in more than four dimensions are not renormalizable in the classic sense , and must be regarded as effective theories which break down at some scale @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , because of the rapid classical evolution of the coupling constant in more than four dimensions , the gauge coupling becomes strong at energy scales on the order of ten times the compactification scale , and thus the scale @xmath1 is expected to be relatively close to @xmath2 . since the nature of the uv completion is unknown , these theories should be understood as an expansion in the energy of the process at hand , with effects of the unknown physics beyond @xmath1 reflected in the ( infinite number of ) undetermined coefficients which must be treated as theoretical inputs .",
    "the theory can be predictive at energies much below @xmath1 , when effects of order @xmath3 may be neglected , and only a finite number of terms in the effective lagrangian contribute to measurable quantities .",
    "in this article we attempt to rigorously treat gauge fields which can propagate in compact extra dimensions from an effective field theory point of view .",
    "we find that in addition to the bulk kinetic terms for the gauge field generally considered in the literature , there is also a kinetic term for the gauge field localized on branes or at the boundaries of an orbifolded compact space .",
    "such a term was recently considered by dvali , gabadadze , and shifman @xcite .",
    "the original motivation was to have the fifth dimension _",
    "infinite _ in size , with the brane term allowing one to recover four dimensional behavior at short distances , but in this article we will show that , as happens in the analogous case of gravity @xcite , it has interesting implications for compact spaces as well .",
    "the brane kinetic term is not suppressed by any power of @xmath1 compared to the 5d couplings which result in the apparently renormalizable 4d interactions at low energies , and is consistent with all symmetries of the theory .",
    "thus , from general renormalizability arguments , one expects that the term _ must _ be included in any consistent description of the theory .",
    "in fact , one can show from explicit computation that such a term is required to cancel divergences in the five dimensional ( 5d ) theory .",
    "thus , its magnitude should be treated as an input to the theory , and one might expect it to be sizable .    in this article , while we have chosen to illustrate the physics with the specific example of bulk gauge fields , we recognize that by no means is this the only possibility . _",
    "any _ bulk field will experience renormalizations on branes or boundaries of the type we are describing .",
    "previous work @xcite has focused on the case of gravity in various background geometries and numbers of dimensions , as is motivated by solutions of the hierarchy problem .",
    "we choose to work with gauge theories in five dimensions because , aside from being well - motivated for the reasons outlined above , they are under better theoretical control than theories with quantum gravity or larger numbers of extra dimensions .",
    "we find that some of the qualitative results seen in the gravitational case , such as the appearance of `` collective '' kaluza - klein modes with small masses and strong couplings , may also be explored in our framework .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : brane ] we briefly discuss the existence of such a brane kinetic term , and argue that from an effective theory point of view it should be included . in section",
    "[ sec : kkmodes ] , we compute the resulting spectrum of kk modes of the gauge fields and examine the masses and couplings to brane and bulk fields . in section  [ sec : pheno ] we examine some of the phenomenological implications of the modifications to masses and couplings .",
    "we reserve section  [ sec : conclusion ] for our conclusions .",
    "we now discuss the existence of local gauge kinetic terms from the point of view of effective field theory . to illustrate our discussion , we consider a five dimensional ( 5d ) theory of gauge fields @xmath4 , [ eq : s5d ] s & = & d^5 x \\",

    "the brane coupling @xmath11 is dimensionless and characterizes the `` opacity '' of the brane .",
    "analyses which neglect the brane term ( @xmath12 ) can be understood as the `` transparent brane '' approximation .",
    "one may rescale the bulk term to its canonical normalization by absorbing @xmath13 into @xmath14 , in which case the brane term has a coefficient with dimensions of length , @xmath15 and @xmath14 has dimension @xmath16 , as usual for a boson in five dimensions .",

    "it is important to note that we have added only the four - dimensional part of the gauge field kinetic term on the brane .",
    "if our theory was invariant under the full 5d set of gauge and lorentz transformations , these symmetries would have forced us to include the full 5d gauge kinetic term .",
    "however , the 5d lorentz invariance is broken firstly by the fact that one of the dimensions is compact , secondly by the orbifold boundary conditions , and finally by choosing @xmath25 as a special point with different physics from the rest of the extra dimension . as discussed above",
    ", five dimensional gauge invariance is similarly present only in a restricted sense .",
    "thus , one could also consider including the remaining terms on the brane with a different coefficient , dx_5 ( x_5 ) \\",
    "{ + interactions } .",
    "[ eq : otherterms ] in the thin brane approximation under which we work , all of these terms may be neglected .",
    "the first two terms vanish because the orbifold boundary conditions require @xmath26 to vanish at the orbifold fixed points ( and in fact we will impose @xmath27 everywhere as a convenient gauge choice ) .",
    "the last term is somewhat more subtle .",
    "naively the orbifold conditions seem to require @xmath28 , as an odd function of @xmath18 , to vanish at the fixed points .",
    "however as we will see below the effect of the brane term is to force the slope of the kk wave functions to be discontinuous at @xmath25 , implying the derivative is not well defined in the thin brane approximation .",
    "however , it is clear that when the derivative is understood in terms of the difference between the wave function of @xmath29 around @xmath25 , the term vanishes .    one can attempt to consider this problem more carefully by introducing a finite brane thickness .",
    "for example , one can replace the @xmath30-function with any smooth function sharply peaked about the orbifold fixed point . in a `` fat brane '' model , which represents the brane and its attendant localized fermions as a scalar field",
    "whose vev has a domain wall profile along the extra dimension , this function is related to the scalar potential which generates the domain wall , and the brane width and shape can be adjusted .",
    "this finite thickness for the brane will smooth our kk wave function solutions such that their derivatives will become well - defined , and in fact the terms in equation  ( [ eq : otherterms ] ) will vanish at @xmath25 .",
    "however , the terms still have some non - zero effect in the region away from @xmath25 , but still inside the brane .",
    "thus , their effect must be proportional to the thickness of the brane , and we are justified in dropping the terms of equation  ( [ eq : otherterms ] ) in the limit in which we treat the brane as infinitely thin .",
    "many theories in which gauge fields exist in extra compact dimensions introduce submanifolds , or branes on which fields may be confined .",
    "a simple application is to have chiral fermions living on a 3-brane .",
    "this allows one to have an effective 4d theory which is chiral , despite the fact that five ( or more ) dimensional theories generally produce mirror fermions after compactification to 4d , and thus are vector - like .",
    "the existence of a brane violates the 5d poincare invariance , and thus one would generically expect terms living on the brane would be invariant only under the 4d poincare invariance of the brane itself .",
    "thus , it would be quite plausible to consider a separate gauge kinetic term on the brane at tree level .",
    "in fact , the existence of charged matter on the brane _ demands _ such a term .",
    "loops of the brane matter fields result in @xmath31 divergent contributions to the gauge field 2-point function , localized on the brane itself @xcite . in this case , if the brane is approximated as infinitely thin the computation becomes effectively four - dimensional because the fields running around in the loops are four dimensional .",
    "in fact , the log divergence is nothing more than the familiar renormalization of the gauge coupling by the brane fields .",
    "the cancellation of the divergence invokes a local term in @xmath18 of the form of the gauge field kinetic term , and indicates that the bare theory without such a term is inconsistent .",
    "after canceling the divergence , what is left behind is a term whose coefficient can not be computed in terms of other quantities of the theory , but must instead be determined by experiment . as usual , a @xmath31 term appears in conjunction with the divergence , and its resummation dictates that even if one were to imagine a uv completion which resulted in the local term being zero at some energy scale , a non - zero term will evolve at other energy scales through renormalization group evolution .",
    "one can , of course , choose the coefficient @xmath32 to be very small , but unless one can derive the small value of @xmath32 within the framework of a more fundamental theory , this choice can be regarded as a fine - tuning .",
    "one may also invoke the fat brane picture , allowing the brane to have a non - zero thickness corresponding to the width of the transition region between the two limiting values of the vev . in this case",
    ", fermions can be localized with wave functions whose widths are related to the thickness of the fat brane .",
    "loops of such fermions will also lead to localized renormalization of the gauge fields , but now with a profile proportional to the fermion wave functions , and not to the @xmath30-function one obtains in the thin brane case .",
    "the detailed shape of the local term is thus model - dependent in general fat brane cases .",
    "it is somewhat counter - intuitive that local terms exist for orbifold theories even in the absence of localized fields .",
    "however , in theories with an orbifold , the identification of @xmath18 with @xmath22 indicates that the sign of momentum along the fifth dimension is not meaningful , and singles out the orbifold fixed points as special points where translation invariance is violated .",
    "these effects may be cast into a particularly convenient form by using technology developed in @xcite , in which one writes the bulk fields obeying orbifold boundary conditions as a combination of fields which are unconstrained .",
    "so , for example , a 5d bulk scalar @xmath33 which is odd under the orbifold @xmath21 is written , ( x^ , x_5 ) & = & where @xmath34 is a 5d scalar field without orbifold boundary conditions , and thus may be treated conventionally .",
    "@xmath33 , by construction , obeys the orbifold boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath33 propagator in momentum space now contains terms which flip the sign of the momentum in the extra dimension , ^ * ( q , q^ ) & = & \\ { } ^4 ( q_- q^ _ ) .",
    "the first term conserves @xmath35 whereas the second induces the sign flip .",
    "if this scalar is now coupled to a bulk gauge field @xmath4 , its loop contributions to the gauge field two - point function will also contain a term which conserves the gauge field momentum , and a term which conserves its magnitude but flips its sign @xcite .",
    "transforming back to position space , one has the operator , -^ f _ where @xmath36 contains the loop integrals , and is log divergent .",
    "again , this signals that the term is in actuality tree - level , and all we have divined is the running from the cut - off scale to the energy scales of interest to us .",
    "therefore , even universal extra dimensions , with no fields living on the boundaries , will generally have kinetic terms which do live on the boundaries .",
    "note that the same term is induced on both boundaries , which is important if a kk parity is to be a self - consistent symmetry of the low energy dynamics .",
    "while the effective field theory perspective strictly demands the coefficient of the brane kinetic term to be a free parameter of the theory , it is interesting to see how large one might expect this term to be if one makes further assumptions . in particular , naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) determines the size of various couplings under the assumption that all couplings are strong at the scale @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "while nda estimates are interesting ( and sometimes useful in order to judge the applicability of perturbation theory ) , we do not wish to consider them as predictions ",
    "we take the more practical view that the brane kinetic terms are remnants of the unknown physics beyond the cut - off , and must be included irrespective of their size in any valid effective field theory description .",
    "the techniques of @xcite allow us to simply determine the values of the couplings @xmath7 and @xmath36 at @xmath1 , and we may use the renormalization group to examine their magnitudes at other energy scales of interest .",
    "the nda estimate for @xmath36 at @xmath1 is given by , r_c & ~ & , and thus @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath1 is as low as roughly 20 times @xmath2 , we have @xmath38 . at lower energy scales",
    "@xmath36 will receive additional logarithmic corrections under the renormalization group .",
    "since these corrections are suppressed by loop factors , they can be considered subdominant corrections to the nda estimates .",
    "finally , we note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , theories with large brane kinetic terms ( relative to their natural scale , @xmath1 ) were found to be perturbatively consistent .",
    "thus , there is nothing problematic with considering them to be large .",

    "note that this set - up preserves a @xmath21 symmetry under which even number kk modes are even and odd number modes are odd .",
    "this kk parity forces couplings involving an odd number of odd - mode fields to vanish .",

    "is realized for the first kk mode , and higher modes are realized for alternating signs .",
    "an interesting feature of the two brane case is evident for @xmath108 , in which the mass of the first kk mode approaches zero and the remaining modes approach their canonical values of @xmath109 .",
    "this contrasts with the one brane case , for which the first kk mode mass was always greater than @xmath110 .",

    "the result is , m^2_1 & = & ( 1 + ) .",
    "this lightest kk mode can be understood to be a sort of `` collective mode '' , composed of a tiny amount of every wave function in the otherwise unperturbed tower .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath74-mode gauge fields to fields confined on either opaque brane may be expressed as , & = & + and is plotted for the first few modes in figure  [ fig : masses2 ] . unlike the rest of the tower , which exhibits similar decoupling from the branes seen in the one brane case , the collective mode s coupling approaches the zero mode coupling in the limit of large @xmath64 .",
    "we have chosen to extend figure  4 up to @xmath114 in order to display the asymptotic behavior as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "= 10.0cm=10.0 cm = 10.0cm=10.0 cm    one can gain intuition into the reason why this feature appears in the case with two opaque branes by considering an observer living on the brane at @xmath25 and measuring the gauge coupling at that brane by scattering various types of charged matter at various energies . at distances somewhat shorter than the size of the extra dimension , the observer fails to realize that the other brane is present , and scattering between matter localized on different branes should cease .",
    "furthermore , at these energies the distances probed are too short to realize that there is a second opaque brane at all , and the observed coupling should not depend on @xmath115 . at very high energies ,",
    "the distances probed are short enough that the fact that there is an extra dimension becomes irrelevant and the coupling should be dominated by the coupling present on the brane , and thus must approach @xmath11 . however , in contrast to the one brane case , the zero mode coupling does not approach @xmath11 , but to a combination of @xmath11 and @xmath115 .",
    "thus , something is needed to restore the correct behavior , and the higher kk modes will not serve because they decouple from the brane . thus , the collective mode s couplings must approach the zero mode coupling ( for @xmath116 ) with an appropriate relative sign in order for the net force to be described by @xmath11 alone .",
    "= 12.0cm=12.0 cm    one can further explore this intuitive picture by examining the effective coupling between fields either on the same brane or on different branes . in the kk description of the theory ,",
    "the net force between them is a sum over all of the kk modes , _",
    "n 0 = ( 1 + _ n 1 ) where @xmath117 is the momentum transfer , @xmath118 is the coupling of the @xmath74th kk mode to the @xmath119-th brane , and @xmath120 is an effective coupling which includes the exchange of all kk modes in the interaction of brane field @xmath119 with brane field @xmath121 .",
    "using our numerical solution for the symmetric two brane case , we can explicitly compute the effective intra- and inter - brane couplings .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : geff1 ] , and illustrates the physics described above . at low @xmath117 the exchange is dominated by the zero mode , and the two effective couplings are equal to the zero mode coupling .",
    "the effect of the collective mode appears rather early , thanks to its small mass , and the couplings begin to differ . for @xmath122 , interactions occur at distance scales smaller than the separation between the two branes , and the intra - brane coupling vanishes as each brane fails to realize that the other is there .",
    "finally , at very large momentum transfer the brane field fails to realize that there is an extra dimension , and the physics is described entirely by its own ( four dimensional ) gauge term with coupling @xmath11 .",
    "= 10.0cm=10.0 cm = 10.0cm=10.0 cm    another interesting case has two branes with different terms . for simplicity , we fix the term on the first brane ( at @xmath25 ) to @xmath123 and allow the term on the second brane ( at @xmath124 ) to vary as @xmath125 . for @xmath126 , this configuration explicitly violates kk parity . as motivation , one might imagine a construction in which some fermions ( for example , the leptons ) are confined to the brane at @xmath25 while some others ( for instance , the quarks ) are confined to the other brane at @xmath94 .",
    "this configuration can suppress local operators leading to unacceptably fast proton decay because of a low planck scale @xcite .",
    "given the asymmetry between the two branes , it would be somewhat contrived if the gauge kinetic terms living on them were the same .",
    "in addition , the much larger number of quark degrees of freedom will imply very different quantum corrections to both terms , so the choice of equal couplings at the two branes is only justified in some particular cases .",
    "= 10.0cm=10.0 cm = 10.0cm=10.0 cm    the kk masses are now solutions of the general two brane eigenmass equation  ( [ eq : eigenmass2 ] ) . in terms of @xmath127 and",
    "@xmath128 its solutions can be expressed , m_n r_1 & = & , where again the @xmath107 sign is realized for the first kk mode solution , and successive modes are realized for alternating signs .",
    "results are plotted for @xmath129 and @xmath130 in figure  [ fig : masses3 ] .",
    "the features are roughly similar to those evident in the symmetric two brane case , including the existence of a collective mode in the limit of @xmath131 with very small mass , m^2_1 & = & ( 2 + ) .",
    "having found the masses , the next step is to examine the wave functions .",
    "we expect that for asymmetric branes , the larger brane term will dominate , pushing the wave functions further away from that brane .",
    "this implies that the higher kk modes couple more weakly to brane fields on one of the opaque branes than to those fields on the other .",
    "this is evident in the wave functions , plotted for the first two modes in figure  [ fig : wf3 ] .",
    "for @xmath132 we see , apart from an over - all sign , equal coupling at both branes , whereas for @xmath133 the wave functions become very small on the brane at @xmath94 .",
    "this has the implication that the kk modes couple much more strongly to fields located on the less opaque brane than to fields localized on the more opaque brane .",
    "we plot these couplings in figure  [ fig : masses3 ] , and find that the effect is quite striking for @xmath133",
    ". one can understand this feature in terms of the effective couplings on each brane .",
    "@xmath133 implies that @xmath134 is very small , and thus dominates the zero mode coupling .",
    "this in turn implies that , since the effective coupling in the ultra - violet should converge to the local brane terms , kk modes should rapidly decouple from the second brane , while they must couple relatively strongly to the first one in order to make up the difference between the zero mode coupling and the local term on that brane .",
    "our results can have profound implications for the phenomenology of models in which gauge fields propagate in the bulk .",
    "the standard picture for this situation is that high energy colliders can identify an extra dimension by discovering the tower of kk modes with masses @xmath135 and couplings @xmath45 times greater than the zero mode coupling to brane - localized matter @xcite . in the limit of a very small gauge - kinetic term on the brane these results",
    "will approximately hold for a large number of kk modes , and this phenomenological picture will remain valid .",
    "however , the results above indicate that these theories have , in addition to the parameter @xmath136 which controls the size of the extra dimension and thus the masses of the kk modes , at least one other , `` hidden '' parameter , @xmath36 , which will distort the kk spectrum and modify the couplings to brane fields . since it is effectively a tree level coupling , it is somewhat arbitrary to set it equal to zero .      as a simple example of what the local brane couplings may do to limits from colliders ,",
    "let us consider the effect of virtual kk photon and @xmath137 exchange on the process @xmath138 .",
    "this was discussed for the transparent brane case in ref .",
    "@xcite . at energies far below the mass of the first kk mode",
    ", the effect of the virtual kk photon exchange can be included model - independently as a four - fermion operator , _ & = & -e^2 q_e q_f , where the dependence on @xmath136 is hidden inside the coefficient @xmath139 , v & = & m_w^2 _ n 1 , [ eq : vnew ] where @xmath140 is the mass of the @xmath74th kk gauge boson and @xmath141 the product of its couplings to the @xmath142 and @xmath143 fields .    in the transparent brane case , v & = & m_w^2 r^2 _ n 1 = 2 m_w^2 r^2 ( 2 ) ( r_c = 0 ) , [ eq : vold ] with the factor of @xmath144 a result of the kk mode couplings being @xmath45 times the zero mode couplings , and the sum over @xmath74 includes all kk states , whose masses are @xmath135 . in the five dimensional case",
    "we consider the sum is convergent to @xmath145 as indicated ( though the result changes only by about @xmath146 if truncated at @xmath147 ) , but in higher dimensions it would have to be cut - off in some fashion , introducing dependence on the uv completion .",
    "similar operators can be written for kk modes of the @xmath148 and @xmath137 ( and in the case of @xmath149 will generally interfere with @xmath150 in physical processes ) . in the @xmath39 limit ,",
    "the quantity @xmath139 will be the same for all of the bulk gauge fields .",
    "thus , including all relevant operators , ref .",

    "the bound becomes @xmath157 or @xmath158 tev .",
    "the situation with @xmath159 can be quite different .",
    "for example , we consider the one - brane case with both @xmath142 and @xmath143 fields living on the opaque brane . to compute @xmath139",
    "one must return to the definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnew ] ) where @xmath141 and @xmath140 are now complicated functions of @xmath136 and @xmath36 , as shown in figure  [ fig : masses ] . the leading term ( from the first kk mode )",
    "may be somewhat enhanced by the mass of that mode being lighter than @xmath65 , but is also somewhat decreased by the suppressed coupling to brane fields .",
    "the suppression dominates the enhancement .",
    "the higher kk number states are still approximately equally spaced in mass , but their couplings to brane fields become highly suppressed , and the sum in equation  [ eq : vnew ] converges much more quickly than the @xmath160 expression in equation  [ eq : vold ] . using the new expression for @xmath139 , we translate the lep and nlc bounds on @xmath139 ( which are independent of the new physics ) into the plane of @xmath65 and @xmath64 . for @xmath161 the limits on @xmath65 can be substantially modified ; for the lep ( projected nlc ) limits derived above , we have , for @xmath38 , @xmath162 tev ( 12 tev ) and for @xmath163 , @xmath164 tev ( 8.1 tev ) .",
    "another interesting possibility is the fact that each gauge group in the bulk may have a separate @xmath36 on the brane .",
    "this would allow mass splittings between the kk modes much larger than one would normally consider from radiative corrections .",
    "this allows each gauge boson to have its own @xmath139 , which would not be expected from the simple extra - dimensional picture with transparent branes .",
    "it further has the effect that the kk modes for the neutral weak boson sector can have a different weinberg angle than the one observed for the zero modes , and thus may be poorly approximated as kk modes of the ordinary photon and @xmath137 , and better represented as different mixtures of heavy copies of the su(2 ) and u(1 ) neutral bosons .",
    "a similar effect can also occur when some of the weak gauge groups and/or higgs fields are confined to a brane @xcite .      when there are two or more branes , the lightest kk mode is generally a collective mode which does not decouple from the brane , and whose mass is not characterized by @xmath165 , but instead by @xmath166 .",
    "this leads to the interesting possibility in which a first kk mode can be discovered , but higher modes ( whose masses are characterized by @xmath165 and whose couplings to brane fields are suppressed ) remain out of reach .",
    "this is very different from the transparent brane case in which one expects evenly spaced kk modes , so that the second mode has mass twice as large as the first mode and the same coupling strength .",
    "the discovery potential for the collective mode will be similar to existing searches for standard @xmath167 and @xmath168 bosons , colorons @xcite , and so forth .    in models with low - scale quantum gravity",
    ", there is motivation to consider the possibility that quarks and leptons live on separate branes , in order to prevent dangerous operators which would mediate proton decay in conflict with existing bounds @xcite .",
    "the simplest implementation of such a picture has two branes , one containing the quarks ( and possibly the gluons ) and the other containing the leptons .",
    "one is thus forced to consider the weak gauge bosons propagating in the bulk , and loops of the brane fermions should induce kinetic terms for the weak gauge fields localized on each brane . given the obvious asymmetry in the underlying dynamics which localized the quarks on one brane but the leptons on the other , it seems natural that one brane ( _ i.e. _ the quark brane ) could have a larger kinetic term than the other one ( _ i.e. _ the lepton brane ) , and the results of section  [ sec : asym ] could be relevant to the phenomenology of the kk modes .",
    "this leads to two interesting variations on the usual phenomenology of bulk gauge fields .",
    "the first is that , owing to the larger repulsion from the quark brane than from the lepton brane , the kk modes may couple more weakly to quarks than to leptons .",
    "this would alter the expected relative production cross sections at , say high energy @xmath169 colliders and hadron colliders , and would further affect the branching ratios into a given species of fermion .",
    "furthermore , at large momentum transfers , the two branes lose sight of each other , and at very high energies , quarks and leptons _ miss _ each other because of their separation in the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "this is evident in our two - brane results for the effective coupling between fields located one on each of the two branes ( see figure  [ fig : geff1 ] ) which approaches zero at high @xmath117 . in contrast , quark - quark and lepton - lepton interactions remain appreciable even at large @xmath117 .",
    "models which separate not only quarks from leptons , but also left- and right - handed quarks and leptons from each other , may naturally explain the observed hierarchy of fermion masses @xcite by generating small yukawa couplings for the zero modes as the tiny overlap in fermion wave functions .",
    "each localized fermion demands a renormalization of the gauge field whose shape is related to the profile of the fermion kk modes , and a full theory of flavor could have as many separate contributions as there are fermions .",
    "the resulting picture is therefore rather complicated and model - dependent , and is beyond the scope of this work , but we can divine some general features from the simple cases we have studied .",
    "first , we would see the high energy suppression of cross sections outlined above for split quarks and leptons for any two different fermions , including same flavor fermions with different helicities !",
    "since the induced localized gauge kinetic terms are sensitive to the shape of the fermion zero mode wave functions , production cross sections and decay branching ratios could be flavor - dependent in a complicated way .",
    "the properties of the kk gauge bosons thus provide one with a powerful test of extra - dimensional flavor dynamics , exploring the cartography of the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "second , models with split fermions have strong flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) constraints from kaluza - klein modes of gauge fields @xcite , because while the gauge fields couple flavor - diagonally , the kk modes couple flavor - dependently , inducing fcnc s after the ckm rotation from the gauge to mass basis is performed .",
    "the limits derived in this way on @xmath165 from the kaon system are quite strong , of order @xmath170 tev .",
    "however , these limits could be relaxed quite substantially if appreciable @xmath36 terms are included .",
    "such terms will force the kk modes of the gauge fields to try to avoid the places where fermions are localized , and would limit the strength of the fcnc s .",
    "theories with extra dimensions offer both unique solutions to the puzzles of particle physics as well as unique theoretical challenges . to date",
    ", all known descriptions must be regarded as effective theories , and without a deeper model to describe the underlying physics responsible for the compactification of dimensions , generation of branes and boundary conditions , and confinement of fields to brane world - volumes , the best one can do is to write down effective descriptions which are self - consistent .",
    "the theoretical motivations are many , and the resulting phenomenology intriguing .",
    "we have explored a simple consequence of any theory with gauge fields in the bulk of the extra dimensions , and charged matter either in the bulk subject to orbifold boundary conditions , or confined to a brane .",
    "radiative corrections to these theories mandate that such branes or boundaries are not transparent to the gauge fields - instead they are opaque .",
    "while the opacity of the brane , parameterized by the size of a kinetic term for the gauge field living on the brane or boundary , is not calculable in terms of other parameters in the theory without introducing assumptions about the nature of the uv completion , this does not justify ignoring it .",
    "such terms may very well be large , and comprise an important part of relating a theory with extra dimensions to the real world . the effect on phenomenology can be sizable , and the result qualitatively different from the situation in which they are neglected .",
    "for example , charged fields confined to an opaque brane will decouple from the high kaluza klein modes of the gauge field , contrasting with the standard picture under with all kk modes couple equally to brane fields .",
    "this decoupling of the higher kk modes is somewhat similar to the effect of dimensional deconstruction @xcite , which replaces an extra dimension with a chain of 4d gauge theories linked by scalar fields . in the deconstructed case ,",
    "the analogues of the kk modes of bulk fields naturally distort and terminate at some high energy scale . in the case of the brane kinetic term ,",
    "the kk spectrum remains infinite , but nevertheless the coupling to brane fields becomes arbitrarily small for arbitrarily heavy modes .",
    "in addition , the existence of local gauge kinetic terms implies there may be collective kk modes whose masses are not related to the size of the extra dimension , but instead to the size of the brane kinetic term .",
    "these collective modes typically do not decouple the way the higher kk modes do , and thus have unique phenomenology compared with the typical expectations of extra dimensional theories .",
    "finally , theories which have different types of matter living at different locations in an extra dimension can show the interesting behavior that at very high energies interactions between different particles are suppressed . at very high energies ,",
    "the particles _ miss _ each other because of their extra - dimensional separation .",
    "in this article we have considered the gauge couplings at tree level . for a complete analysis",
    "it would be necessary to evaluate the renormalization group evolution of the couplings .",
    "we reserve this for future work , but comment on the salient features here . for the zero mode gauge boson",
    ", the coupling will evolve approximately as expected in a five dimensional theory with transparent branes @xcite because the zero mode couples universally to all fields .",
    "however , for non - abelian gauge theories , there will be alterations to the evolution because of the shift in the positions of the thresholds of the higher kk modes .",
    "however , the mass spacing between modes of @xmath65 remains approximately valid .",
    "for the higher kk mode fields , the evolution will be modified by the presence of the brane term .",
    "for example , higher modes will barely feel any contribution to their running from fields on the opaque brane , and the contributions from other kk mode gauge bosons will be modified by the distortion of the wave functions .",
    "our framework has been five dimensional theories with gauge fields living in all five dimensions .",
    "we have chosen this framework because it is simple and predictive , but there are many alternatives to explore .",
    "our results are representative for _ any _ bulk field , and suggest that a complete , self - consistent effective theory including compact dimensions has a few more parameters than one might naively guess .",
    "the appearance of divergences , which must be renormalized , implies that it is more generic to treat these effects as tree - level couplings , in contrast to the naive expectation that they arise as loop effects .",
    "it would also be interesting to explore larger numbers of compact dimensions , to see the results in theories with six or more dimensions .",
    "in addition , it would be exciting to see if our results could be exploited in model - building , allowing new extra dimensional theories to better explain the puzzles of the standard model .",

    "<S> we examine localized kinetic terms for gauge fields which can propagate into compact extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such terms are generated by radiative corrections in both theories with matter fields confined to branes and in theories imposing orbifold boundary conditions on bulk matter . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the radiative corrections are logarithmically divergent , indicating that from an effective field theory point of view they can not be predicted in terms of other parameters , and should be treated as independent leading order parameters of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> specializing to the five dimensional case , we show that these terms may result in gross distortions of the kaluza - klein gauge field masses , wave functions , and couplings to brane and bulk matter . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phenomenological implications are discussed . </S>"
