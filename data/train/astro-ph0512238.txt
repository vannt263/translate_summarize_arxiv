    "quasar absorption line spectroscopy is a powerful probe for the investigation of gas in the cosmic web .",
    "it offers a high sensitivity that makes it possible to trace different gas phases over a large range of redshifts , exploring both the intergalactic medium and a variety of morphologies and evolutionary stages of galaxies .",
    "the resonant doublet has been extensively used to trace metals in galaxies at @xmath5 , the redshift range for which lies in the optical .",
    "it is found that these low ionization systems , with @xmath6   , produce lyman limit breaks @xcite .",
    "the gas kinematics , evident in high resolution absorption profiles , are consistent with material in both the disks and extended halos of the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "almost all of these `` strong '' systems are found within @xmath7  kpc of @xmath8 galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both observationally and theoretically , it is also expected that metal - rich absorbing gas can be found out to distances of at least @xmath9  kpc from luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "this gas can be detected through absorption in higher ionization species and/or as weak low ionization absorption .",
    "weak low ionization absorbers , with @xmath10   , constitute a significant fraction of the high column density regime ( @xmath11 ) of the forest at @xmath12 @xcite . with @xmath13 for @xmath14",
    ", they are twice as likely to be found along the quasar line of sight as strong low ionization absorbers @xcite .",
    "the majority of these systems arise in an optically thin , sub - lyman limit environment @xcite . unlike strong absorbers",
    ", weak low ionization absorbers typically are not associated with bright galaxies ( with @xmath15 ) to within a @xmath16  kpc impact parameter of the quasar line of sight ( @xcite ; but see @xcite for exceptions ) .",
    "this suggests that weak low ionization systems are a physically different population from strong absorbers , a result confirmed by the equivalent width distribution measured from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "two thirds of weak low ionization absorbers have only a single narrow component with a doppler @xmath17 parameter of just a few @xcite .",
    "detection of in some of these systems indicates a small ionization parameter and high density , which implies a small size , @xmath18  pc @xcite .",
    "based on photoionization models , at least some single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers without detected are constrained to have similarly small sizes @xcite .",
    "the absence of a lyman limit break and the strength of the lyman series lines provide constraints on the absorbers metallicities .",
    "surprisingly , the derived metallicities are almost always greater than 10% solar , and are often as high as the solar value @xcite .",
    "those absorbers with a large iron to magnesium ratio must incorporate material from type ia supernovae , in which case the metals would be generated `` in - situ '' .",
    "their large observed numbers along quasar lines of sight , in combination with the small derived sizes , suggests that single - cloud low ionization systems must be extremely abundant .",
    "if they are assumed to have a spherical geometry there would be over a million such structures per bright galaxy .",
    "most of the single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers have an associated higher ionization phase that gives rise to absorption @xcite .",
    "photoionization modeling of three systems along the pg  @xmath19 line of sight showed that low ionization absorption arises in a relatively high density region ( @xmath20 ) with a thickness of @xmath21@xmath22  pc .",
    "higher ionization absorption arises in one or more lower density regions ( @xmath23 ) , with sizes on the order of a kiloparsec @xcite .",
    "the other third of the weak low ionization absorbers have multiple , rather than single , low ionization clouds .",
    "modeling of one of these systems , toward pg  1634 + 704 led to a derived , low metallicity of @xmath33% solar in the low ionization gas @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the low and high ionization gas suggested an origin in a pair of dwarf galaxies or in a symmetric wind from a starbursting dwarf @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite have suggested that local analogs to weak low ionization absorbers are related to winds from starbursting dwarfs . in the case of the weak low ionization absorber at @xmath24 toward 3c  273 @xcite ,",
    "there is a post  starbursting dwarf galaxy , with a consistent redshift , at an impact parameter of @xmath25  kpc @xcite .",
    "if winds from dwarfs typically produce multiple - cloud , weak low ionization absorption , then dwarf galaxies could be responsible for a large fraction of that absorber population .",
    "on the other hand , there is evidence that some multiple - cloud weak low ionization absorbers are produced by lines of sight through the outskirts of luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "this subclass would simply be an extension of the strong low ionization absorber population , which is directly produced by luminous galaxies @xcite .    the single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers present a dilemma .",
    "they are not closely related to luminous galaxies like strong absorbers , yet they have high metallicities inconsistent with production in the traditional gas phase of dwarfs .",
    "@xcite suggested that they might be produced in population iii , pre - galactic star clusters or in supernovae remnants in very low luminosity galaxies , but these are only examples from possible classes of scenarios . in this paper , we seek constraints on the nature of the physical structures that produce the low and high ionization phase absorption in single ",
    "cloud , weak low ionization absorption line systems .    _",
    "our strategy is to compare the relative numbers and kinematics of systems with detected absorption from both low and high ionization phases to those of systems without absorption detected from one or the other of those phases . _ for example , in principle , the low ionization absorption could be produced in a small spherical region embedded in a much larger spherical structure that produces absorption . in this case , we would expect that most systems have only high ionization absorption .",
    "we use the archive of _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst_)/ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) echelle spectra ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) @xcite in order to make these comparisons , considering systems with coverage of and at least some low ionization transitions ( @xmath21260 , @xmath21335 , and/or mg0.1emii  @xmath1 ) .    in   [ sec : data ]",

    "we first searched for the c0.1emiv  @xmath4 doublet in the @xmath29 quasar spectra from the stis / echelle archive .",

    ", we also visually inspected the alignment and the profile shapes of the doublet lines .",
    "if the lines closely correspond to one another , and there is no contradictory indication from , we consider the system to be `` real '' . in order to be included in our sample we also required that the @xmath30 and coverage of available spectra allowed for detection of low ionization absorption tracers .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths or equivalent width limits at the expected positions of the low ionization features in all of the `` real '' systems .",
    "for some systems , mg0.1emii  @xmath1 was covered in our keck / hires data .",
    "however , when those data were not available , since mg0.1emii  @xmath1 is not covered in the _",

    "our goal is to better understand the nature of the structures in which the low and high ionization absorption arises .",

    "some systems have single components of high ionization absorption and some have multiple components .",
    "the absorption tends to be similar , but somewhat weaker , for high only systems than for low + high ionization systems , both in the strongest component and in outlying components .",
    "the absorption is very closely related to the kinematics of the profiles , more so than it is to the low ionization absorption .",
    "our discussion will focus on the origin of single - cloud weak low ionization systems with properties adopted from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we choose this subset because many multiple - cloud weak low ionization systems may have a different physical origin , as described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "the structures that produce single - cloud weak low ionization absorption were found to have thicknesses ranging from @xmath128  pc ",
    "@xmath22  pc , and densities of @xmath129  .",
    "the narrow line profiles imply a velocity dispersion of @xmath130  , which corresponds to a virial mass of @xmath131  m@xmath132 for a @xmath34  pc structure .",
    "this is a considerably larger mass than the gas mass in a spherical structure with density @xmath133   and radius @xmath34  pc .",
    "this suggests confinement by dark matter mini - halos or by a stellar structure such as a galaxy or star cluster .",
    "the high ionization absorption related to the same systems is produced in larger structures , with larger velocity dispersions and with sizes of @xmath128  kpc , which could be related to confinement .    in our survey , we found both low+high ionization systems and high only systems .",
    "point 4 above implies that there are real differences , either in degree or kind , between the low + high systems and the high only systems .",
    "there appear to be two different kinds of structures , those with low ionization regions of higher density covering most of their area , and those without these higher density regions along the line of sight . in this way we can explain the high only systems and the weaker , offset components in low + high ionization systems as a different or less extreme population than the central component of a low + high ionization system . in this population , eg .",
    ", the total hydrogen column density might have been lower so that a higher density substructure did not collapse in the region .",
    "the data would also be consistent with a column density , for clustered clouds , that tends to decrease outward from a central cloud in which absorption arises . without such a fall - off , a model could not explain the observed difference between the @xmath134 of the component centered on the low ionization absorption and the offset and high only system components .    guided by these general principles ,",
    "we now consider the most basic `` toy  model '' scenarios for the origins of the low and high ionization absorption in single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers :    1 .   _ single spherical low ionization region inside spherical high ionization region_ the first ,",
    "simplest model to consider , based on derived sizes , is one in which a @xmath135  pc low ionization cloud is embedded in a @xmath128  kpc higher ionization halo .",
    "this model would give rise to @xmath136 more high only systems than single - cloud low + high systems .",
    "we observe a ratio of only @xmath137 , such a severe discrepancy that this model is easily ruled out .",
    "_ multiple spherical low ionization regions inside spherical high ionization region_ + the previous model can be improved by using multiple spherical low ionization clouds inside a high ionization halo . in order to produce the derived ratio of high only to low + high ionization systems",
    ", the covering factor should be @xmath138 .",
    "this would imply a probability of @xmath139 of passing through two of the low ionization clouds along a given line of sight .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the data , since some fraction of the @xmath140% of weak low ionization systems that have multiple clouds could be produced in this way .",
    "however , in order to produce @xmath138 , there would need to be @xmath141 low ionization structures with a size of @xmath135  pc in each @xmath128  kpc high ionization halo .",
    "if the ratio of sizes of low to high ionization structures was instead @xmath142 , there would have to be a factor of @xmath143 more small clouds per large halo .",
    "the average spacing between the small clouds in the halo would be @xmath144  pc for the first choice of size ratio , and @xmath145  pc for the second .",
    "this is not much larger than the cloud size , and seems a very contrived situation . without a physical model to support such a scenario , we consider this model unlikely , though it is not strictly ruled out .",
    "also , this simple model does not produce offset high ionization components as are found in our survey .",
    "+ we can modify this model to attempt to explain the observed offset components . in this modified model",
    ", separate high ionization halos would give rise to these components .",
    "these halos would have lower covering factors for low ionization absorption than the `` main '' halo ( the one giving rise to low ionization absorption ) .",
    "since we are constrained to have an average of one offset component per low + high system , roughly half of the sky , looking out from the main halo , would need to be covered by the separate high ionization halos . in this case , looking from a large distance at the clustered group of halos , an observer would see a covering factor for the separate high ionization halos that greatly exceeds that from the main halo .",
    "adding the separate high ionization halos would therefore produce more high only systems than we observe , so that in fact we have not improved on the model afterall .",
    "_ low ionization shell surrounding high ionization shell_ + alternatively , we now consider a situation where a low ionization shell surrounds an interior shell of high ionization gas . in order not to exceed the number of multiple - cloud weak low ionization absorbers ( relative to single - cloud )",
    ", the low ionization shell should be fragmented .",
    "this fragmented shell must cover roughly @xmath146% of the surface area of the bubble ( assuming small fragments ) , so that it is more typical to pass through low ionization absorption on only one side of the interior region .",
    "+ with only a single such `` bubble '' , there is no clear explanation for offset high ionization components for this model .",
    "we might expect either one or two high ionization components , depending on the covering factor of the high ionization shell .",
    "it is not clear that a component without detected low ionization absorption would have a smaller column density than one which did , since it would come from a different layer . to account for the offset components",
    ", we can consider clustering of `` bubbles '' .",
    "however , such a model suffers from the same problems as our similar attempts to modify model 2 , in that the additional bubbles will produce too large a ratio of high only to low + high ionization systems .",
    "network of filaments / sheets which gives rise to high ionization absorption , with embedded low ionization condensations_ + we finally consider a model in which low ionization condensations are embedded in filaments and/or sheets which give rise to high ionization absorption . the overall covering factor of the low ionization regions ( relative to high ionization regions ) must be @xmath138 to explain the observed ratio of high only to low + high ionization systems . in view of the small low ionization cloud thicknesses ,",
    "a filamentary / sheetlike geometry is a straightforward way to produce the observed covering factor , without requiring huge numbers of separate spherical clouds .",
    "the lines of sight through filaments / sheets that do not give rise to low ionization absorption are typically characterized by smaller @xmath134 values than those that do .",
    "these smaller @xmath134 structures would give rise both to high only systems and to the offset high ionization components of low + high systems .",
    "in such a model , we would expect the number of high ionization components to be similar for the two categories of systems , as is observed .",
    "we favor this model because it naturally produces all of the results derived from our survey .",
    "in the previous discussion , we intentionally avoided consideration of the physical models that might give rise to weak low ionization absorption . instead , we focused on basic geometric possibilities , some of which we were able to exclude based upon results of our survey .",
    "now , we consider the connections between these geometries and the possible mechanisms for the origin of the absorbing clouds .    based upon photoionization modeling , @xcite sketched out three classes of physical models , for single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers , that were consistent with the data . in one class ,",
    "the weak absorption arose from the traces of gas remaining in a population iii , pre - galactic or dwarf galaxy star cluster , with the high ionization absorption coming from gas bound in the surrounding dark matter halo . in the second class of models , the weak absorption is produced in fragments of shells from type ia supernovae , housed in a surrounding dark matter halo . in the third class of models , the absorption arises in high velocity cloud structures that are typically found in galaxy groups .    the most basic form of a star cluster model for weak absorption matches scenario 1 in   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "if there is only one star cluster per spherical dark matter halo ( which produces the high ionization absorption ) then this model is clearly ruled out by cross - section arguments .",
    "the idea of having many star clusters per dark matter halo is described by scenario 2 . it does not seem reasonable to have such a tight packing of star clusters as would be required .",
    "furthermore , this type of model can not be consistent with the small number of high only systems compared to low + high ionization systems .",
    "although it agreed quite well with velocity dispersions and derived cloud sizes of the low and high ionization phases , it appears that star cluster models are ruled out .",
    "the next model we consider is one in which supernova remnant shells produce the weak , low ionization absorption , as described in scenario 3 in   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the absorption is most likely to be in a concentric shell inside of the low ionization shell .",
    "it is not unreasonable that a supernova remnant would have a patchy shell structure in order to produce the @xmath146% covering of the surface area as required by our survey results .",
    "however , for this scenario , as with scenario 2 , we were unable to envision a clustering of remnants that would appropriately produce observed offset high ionization absorption without overproducing high only systems .    another physical picture to which scenario 2 applies is weak absorption arising in superwinds , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite as an explanation for absorption coincidence ( low ionization and at similar velocities ) between the @xmath116 system toward rxj  1230.8 + 0155 and the nearby @xmath24 system toward 3c  273 , separated by @xmath147  kpc .",
    "support for this hypothesis is provided by the detection of a post - starburst galaxy at an impact parameter of @xmath148  kpc from the 3c  273 line of sight . in that specific case , it is hard to explain the absence of absorption along the 3c  273 line of sight in the context of a superwind cone / shell with a series of ionized layers .",
    "however , more generally , the superwind idea is compelling since low ionization absorption is observed in nearby superbubbles / winds @xcite .",
    "clearly , such winds must present a non - negligible cross section for absorption . @xcite",
    "have suggested that they may be responsible for some multiple - cloud weak absorbers .",
    "however , we argue here that there are problems with using them to explain single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers based upon our considerations of scenario 2 . again ,",
    "offset components require clustered additional bubbles / winds which would produce too many high only systems .",
    "this leads us to focus primarily on scenario 4",
    ".    there are similarities between recent models for high velocity cloud structure in the local group @xcite and scenario 4 .",
    "@xcite describes low ionization clouds sweeping through a hot medium ( either a galactic corona or an intergalactic medium ) to produce high ionization absorption in a conductive or turbulent interface .",
    "the local group high velocity clouds cover large areas of the sky and exhibit similar absorption strengths and coherent motions over large angular scales @xcite , suggesting sheetlike geometries .",
    "we found that scenario 4 was consistent with our survey results .",
    "@xcite stated that the single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers with large column densities could not be produced by high velocity cloud analogs .",
    "this was because the high iron abundance that was required implied `` in situ '' star formation rather than ejection from type ii sne .",
    "although present - day star formation is limited in the milky way high velocity clouds , past star formation is not ruled out , making a high velocity cloud model for single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers more likely .",
    "we also note that absorption , which we have not examined in our survey , should accompany absorption for analogs to local group high velocity clouds .",
    "although scenario 4 applies to high velocity cloud models , it also applies more generally .",
    "it remains to be understood how high velocity cloud models fit in with the `` bigger picture '' of the cosmic web of filaments and sheets expected from cosmological simulations .",
    "another related possible scenario has weak low ionization absorption arising in collapsed regions in material in tidal debris or as a result of ram pressure due to high velocity infall through a hot intracluster or intragroup medium .",
    "although it may not be common in the present - day universe , there is at least one example of widespread star formation in a group of galaxies moving through the rich cluster , a1367 @xcite .",
    "the star formation is taking place in many dwarf galaxies and in intergalactic regions , and it is of particular interest that the metallicities in these star - forming regions are close to the solar value @xcite , despite their dwarf environments .",
    "this implies that weak low ionization absorbers could also arise in dwarfs , or at least in certain regions of some types of dwarfs .",
    "a faded population of such objects from similar processes acting at high redshifts could present non - negligible cross - section .",
    "the geometry of the remnant gas is uncertain , but could be consistent with our scenario 4 .",
    "this idea is not necessarily distinct from the origin of high velocity clouds or from the general cosmic web .",
    "the overlap between the single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers and the population of absorbers at low redshift is substantial .",
    "thus information about the physical environments of absorbers could provide clues to the nature of the single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers . by connecting absorption features with nearby galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that galaxies are surrounded by halos with an extent of @xmath149  kpc at @xmath150   .",
    "they favored a scenario in which these halos were produced by gas stripped from accreting satellite galaxies .",
    "also , it follows from their figure  3 that all absorbers with detected @xmath151   were found within @xmath152  kpc .",
    "there are many additional galaxies at larger impact parameters that have only @xmath71 limits on @xmath153 , most of which fall between @xmath21-@xmath154   . however , many of these may lie significantly below that detection limit .    in our sample , 5/6 of the low + high single - cloud",
    "weak low ionization and 4/6 of the high only systems have @xmath155   . based upon the results of @xcite",
    ", we would therefore expect that the majority of these absorbers are produced within @xmath152  kpc of a galaxy .",
    "it also follows that a significant fraction of the single - cloud weak low ionization absorbers would be within this radius of a galaxy .",
    "the fact that we did not find a large number of high only systems implies that a large fraction of the absorption regions around galaxies also produces single cloud weak low ionization absorption .",
    "this loose association between weak low ionization absorption and luminous galaxies is consistent with recent observations in individual cases @xcite , and is not inconsistent with previous claims that close associations are uncommon @xcite .",
    "our study indicates that , although weak mgii absorbers are not directly associated with luminous galaxies , they are in their environments .",
    "however , our statistics are relatively small , and more ultra - violet spectra are needed to increase our understanding of the low redshift weak low ionization absorber population . based on the geometrical considerations in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] , we favor a general model in which spherical or flattened low ionization condensations or transient regions inhabit sheets and/or filaments which give rise to high ionization . in this model ,",
    "the covering factor of the high ionization region by low ionization condensations would need to be large , close to 50% .",
    "this type of origin in such a cosmic web is not necessarily different from an origin in satellite dwarf galaxies or failed dwarf galaxies , or in high velocity clouds , which are themselves components of the web .",
    "single - cloud weak low ionization absorption requires condensations , apart from luminous galaxies , in which stars have formed .",
    "such regions could be otherwise undetected components of the cosmic web , yet to be resolved in numerical simulations .",
    "however , they could also be related to known structures with uncertain origin , like the high velocity clouds , that are already known to be clustered around galaxies . in any case",

    "<S> we consider geometries and possible physical models for weak low ionization absorbers based on the relative incidence of low and high ionization absorption systems . to facilitate this </S>",
    "<S> , we present a survey of weak low ionization absorption systems ( @xmath0 ) in 35 quasar spectra from the archive of high resolution , ultra - violet _ hst_/stis data . when possible , we supplemented these spectra with keck / hires and _ hst_/fos data that cover more transitions over a larger range of wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we found a total of 16 metal - line systems , with low and/or high ionization absorption detected . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the weak low ionization absorbers ( which we probe with mg0.1emii  @xmath1 or through the combination of @xmath21335 and @xmath21260 ) trace an abundant population of metal - enriched regions ( close to solar metallicity ) . </S>",
    "<S> generally , models show that these systems have a @xmath310pc region of higher density gas and a @xmath31kpc region that represents a lower density phase of higher ionization absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of our survey was to compare absorption systems detected in low and/or high ionization gas ( the latter traced with c0.1emiv  @xmath4 absorption ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find the following : 1 . </S>",
    "<S> all but 1 of the 10 weak low ionization systems have a related high ionization phase . in 3 cases </S>",
    "<S> the high ionization gas has only a single component , kinematically centered on the low ionization absorption , and in the other 6 cases there are additional high ionization components offset in velocity . </S>",
    "<S> there is one system , toward quasar 3c  273 , without a high ionization cloud ; 2 . </S>",
    "<S> there are just 6 systems with only a high ionization phase as compared to the 9 systems with both low and high ionization phases ; 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the high ionization absorption in weak low ionization systems is , on average , stronger than in systems with only high ionization absorption ; 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the high ionization absorption in weak low ionization systems has similar kinematic structure to that in high ionization only systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that filamentary and sheetlike geometries are favored , due to the relatively small observed cross - section of high ionization only systems . </S>",
    "<S> our statistical arguments suggest that , although low ionization absorbers are not closely associated with luminous galaxies , they arise in their immediate environments within the cosmic web . </S>"
