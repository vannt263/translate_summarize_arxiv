    "comets provide unique information on the cosmic abundances of the solar nebula which collapsed to form the solar system . besides sodium , already detected in many comets , very few data regard the alkali content of comet nuclei .",
    "in particular , potassium was remotely detected @xcite in spectra of comet c/1965 s1 ( ikeya - seki ) , where the na / k ratio was as high as that observed in mercury @xcite .",
    "a detection of the potassium line at 7698.9645   in comet c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) was reported by @xcite , but no na / k ratio has been extracted from this spectrum yet .",
    "laboratory analyses of samples collected at comet 81p / wild 2 showed that most potassium is in form of eifelite and k - feldspar grains @xcite .",
    "detections of the potassium and lithium lines were also reported from the impacts of comet d/1993 f2 ( shoemaker - levy 9 ) on jupiter @xcite .",
    "the na / li ratio extracted from spectra of the plume in jupiter s atmosphere were consistent with a meteoritic ratio @xcite , although these transient emissions , unlike resonant fluorescence , could not be readily converted into atomic abundances and were probably contaminated by the alkali of jupiter s deep atmosphere . in this report",
    "we discuss the remote detection of potassium in comet c/2011 l4 ( panstarrs ) , which allows us to discuss the na / k abundance in this comet . as well as in models of mercury s exosphere @xcite , we will discuss the transfer of alkali atoms from the parent bodies ( mainly the dust grains in the sunward coma ) to the beginning of alkali tails @xcite where they have been observed .",
    "this will allow us to face actual estimates of lithium abundances in comets .",
    "the physical process relating alkali line intensities to atomic abundance is very simple , namely resonance fluorescence @xcite .",
    "the absorption of solar radiation in the resonance transitions populates atomic upper levels , which trickling down give rise to the emission lines .",
    "the population in the upper level depends on the energy available at the considered wavelength , i.e. upon whether a fraunhofer line comes in the way of absorption or not .",
    "these fraunhofer lines as seen from the comet have different doppler shifts depending on the radial heliocentric velocity @xmath4 ( the so - called swing effect ) .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath5 in the spectral range 424 - 864 nm ) echelle spectra ( fig .",
    "1 ) of comet c/2011 l4 ( panstarrs ) were obtained on 21.8 ut march 2013 ( mid exposure time ) with the multi - mode spectrograph mounted on the 0.6 m telescope at osservatorio astronomico schiaparelli located in campo dei fiori , varese , italy @xcite .",
    "the multi - order echelle spectra were absolutely flux calibrated against spectra of the standard star hr 464 located on the sky nearby , observed immediately after the comet , and then merged into a 1d continuous spectra .",
    "the slit was e - w oriented and guided on the brightest coma by means of a monitor of a guiding ccd - camera covering @xmath6 arcmin@xmath7 on the sky .",
    "the slit width projected on the sky was set to 4 arcsec , and the slit length to 17 arcsec .",
    "the total exposure time was 40 min .",
    "at the observations , the sun - comet distance was @xmath0 au ; the earth - comet distance @xmath8 au ; the comet was receding from the sun at a speed of 36 km s@xmath9 , and from earth at a speed of 14 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the sun - comet - earth phase angle was 54 degrees .",
    "images of the same dust coma showed that the apex distance ( i.e. the distance between the brightest inner coma and its sunward boundary ) was about 100 arcsec , corresponding to @xmath10 km projected along the sun - comet vector .",
    "the cometary spectrum show a number of emission features with very prominent nai but also with the ki lines clearly detected .",
    "other identified emissions include the c@xmath11 swan band dv=0 and the satellite dv=1 e dv=-1 , nh2 ( 7 - 0 ) and nh2 ( 9 - 0 ) , and the [ oi ] at @xmath12 6300 and 6363   redshifted of 14 km s@xmath9 ( fig .",
    "the alkali lines are shown in figs . 2 and 3 , where the reconstructed profile is estimated after accounting for the contamination of the telluric o@xmath11 absorption bands and of the solar spectrum reflected by the cometary dust .",
    "these corrections are computed by means of a twilight spectrum which was also recorded with the same spectrograph setup .",
    "the ki line at @xmath12 7664.8991   ( binned thick black line in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 ) is blended with two telluric o@xmath11 lines at 7664.73 and 7665.79  , and with the ki solar absorption produced by comet dust reflection of the solar light and redshifted by 50 km s@xmath9 . in order to reconstruct the cometary ki emission ,",
    "we used a twilight spectrum ( continuous red line in the same panel ) to which we subtracted the solar ki absorption at rest ( left dashed red line in the same panel ) and added the ki absorption redshifted by 50 km s@xmath9 ( right dashed red line in the same panel ) .",
    "the obtained local continuum ( dashed blue line in the same panel ) well reproduces the wings of the absorption .",
    "the resulting emission ki line ( continuous blue line in the same panel ) is the difference between the original spectrum ( binned thick black line in the same panel ) and the reconstructed local continuum ( dashed blue line in the left panel of fig .",
    "the other ki emission line at @xmath12 7698.9645   ( right panel of fig .",
    "2 ) and the nai lines at @xmath12 5895.9242 and 5889.9510   ( fig .",
    "3 ) are not contaminated by telluric bands , but are partially eroded by the corresponding solar absorption line reflected by the comet dust . in these cases , the twilight feature ( continuous red line ) has been redshifted by 50 km s@xmath9 to match the red wing and to reconstruct the true emission profile ( continuous blue line in figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the intensities of the corrected alkali lines are reported in table 1 .",
    "no emission is detected at the position of the lii @xmath12 6707.78    line ( fig .",
    "4 ) and the 3@xmath13 upper limit for the lii emission is shown in table 1 .    the abundance na / x of sodium related to an atom x ( table 1 ) is extracted from the line intensity @xmath14 ( table 1 ) by means of the relationship na / x = ( @xmath15 ) , where the @xmath16-factors @xmath17 at 1 au are computed ( table 1 ) as a function of the heliocentric radial velocity @xmath4 ( thus taking into account the swing effect ) using the high resolution visible solar flux @xcite and the oscillator strengths for the observed resonant lines @xcite .",
    "regarding @xmath18 at @xmath19 = 7664.8991  , in the range @xmath20",
    "km s@xmath9 the solar spectrum is dominated by the strong absorption of telluric oxigen , so that we had to assume the same mean value obtained at smaller and larger @xmath4-values .",
    "the intensity ratio between the two na and k lines ( @xmath21 for na and @xmath22 for k , respectively ) matches the corresponding @xmath16-factor ratio ( @xmath23 for na and @xmath24 for k , respectively ) , so that we can exclude significant optical thickness in the lines .",
    "five processes are expected to extract alkali atoms from the parent body , namely ( i ) thermal desorption , ( ii ) photon - stimulated desorption , ( iii ) solar wind sputtering , ( iv ) micro - meteoroid vaporization , and ( v ) photodissociation of parent molecules . given the atomic parameters of alkali and the results of laboratory experiments on cosmic analogues , it is expected that the cloud of atoms leaving the parent surface maintains its original ( presumably solar ) abundance @xcite .",
    "hereinafter , when we refer to solar lithium abundance , we mean that measured in meteorites @xcite .",
    "after the atom release , many phenomena have to be taken into account to infer the na / k ratio in mercury s exosphere @xcite , the main one occurring in comets too is photoionization by solar uv radiation .",
    "all alkali atoms are pushed in the anti - sunward direction by solar radiation pressure , with accelerations @xmath25 in the comet reference frame . here",
    "@xmath26 is the gravitational constant , @xmath27 is the sun mass , @xmath28 is the sun - comet distance , and @xmath29 is the ratio between solar gravity and radiation pressure forces . from the @xmath16-factors we compute ( table 1 ) @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the velocity of light and @xmath32 is the mass of the atom @xcite . as it happens for the ejection of iron atoms @xcite , alkali atoms should be mainly ejected from dust , which should be mostly ejected from the comet nucleus into the sunward sector of the coma . before reaching the observation slit ,",
    "the atoms have to cover at most @xmath10 km ( i.e. the apex distance ) in the anti - sunward direction , which requires the flight times @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s , respectively .",
    "taking into account the photoionization lifetimes listed in table 1 , the original na / k ratio would increase by a factor 3 , so that we can not exclude an original solar ratio na / k = 15.5 @xcite .",
    "in other words , what we actually observed was the beginning of the alkali tail , where k is depleted vs sodium by its shorter photoionization lifetime . in order to cover the same distance of @xmath10 km , lithium atoms need a flight time @xmath35 s. taking into account its photoionization lifetime ( table 1 )",
    ", we get an increase of the original na / li ratio by a factor 2 only , very far from the factor 8 required to match the solar ratio na / li = @xmath36 @xcite to the observed one .",
    "the required factor 8 would be observed at @xmath37 km from the nucleus , corresponding to 12 arcmin , a distance impossible to accept since the slit tracking was done on the brightest inner coma with a mean diameter of 3 arcmin .",
    "we conclude that lithium in comet c/2011 l4 is depleted by a factor @xmath38 with respect to the solar ratio .",
    "sodium and potassium were detected in spectra of comet c/1965 s1 ( ikeya - seki ) at the distance @xmath39 au , when the comet was receding from the sun at a velocity of 110 km s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we consider the observed intensities of the alkali lines na @xmath12 5889.9510 and ki @xmath12 7698.9645 measured by @xcite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . by means of the @xmath16-factors",
    "reported in table 1 , we obtain na / k = @xmath42 and na / li @xmath43 , that are values in close agreement with those measured in c/2011 l4 . @xcite obtained even higher values assuming excitation mechanisms more complex than fluorescence . however , the resulting excitation temperatures are quite different among different atoms , and their physical interpretation is difficult . due to the intensity of sodium lines ,",
    "these were saturated in the obtained photographic spectra , so that we can not exclude that the sodium lines were optically thick .",
    "however , since sodium is by far the most abundant among alkali atoms , we can assume that optical thickness affected potassium ( and lithium if any ) much less than sodium .",
    "this would further increase the ratios listed above .",
    "we assume that the alkali atoms have to cover an anti - sunward distance of @xmath44 km ( exactly matching the slit length of one arcmin used in the spectrograph setup ) after they are ejected by the dust in the sunward coma . in order to cover such a distance , the atoms need flight times @xmath45 s and @xmath46 s , respectively .",
    "taking into account the photoionization lifetimes listed in table 1 , the original na / k ratio would increase by a factor 8 , more than required to match an original solar na / k ratio .",
    "therefore , an original solar na / k ratio would remain consistent with observations even if the na / k ratio in the alkali tail had been a factor 3 higher due to optically thick sodium lines . on the other hand ,",
    "lithium atoms need a flight time @xmath47 s. taking into account its photoionization lifetime , we get an increase of the original na / li ratio by a factor 4 only , very far from the factor 33 required to match the solar na / li ratio to the observed one . we conclude that lithium was depleted with respect to the solar abundance in comet c/1965 s1 too , by a factor @xmath3 , even more constraining than in comet c/2011 l4 . actual detection of lithium in future bright comets may help to understand if such a depletion is original in comet nuclei , or is due to a less efficient process of extraction with respect to other alkali atoms .",
