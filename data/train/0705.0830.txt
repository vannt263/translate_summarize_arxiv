    "which root is the physical one ?",
    "our work grows out of a recent controversy over this question in the context of negative refraction of electromagnetic plane waves .",
    "chen , fischer , and wise ( cfw ) considered an isotropic nonmagnetic medium with a relative permittivity scalar @xmath2 as a function of the angular frequency @xmath3  @xcite . herein , the constants @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath9 @xmath13 @xmath11 . the permittivity scalar comprises a passive and an inverted component .",

    "cfw deduced that for @xmath14 $ ]  nm , the refractive index @xmath18 must be such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this deduction stemmed from the premise that the phase angle of @xmath21 is a continuous function of @xmath15 , which has been supported by certain recent theoretical arguments @xcite .",
    "accordingly , cfw argued that their medium could refract negatively .",
    "alternatively , on the basis that ( i ) energy flow grows along the direction of propagation when @xmath22  @xcite ; or ( ii ) the real part of the wave impedance is positive  valued on the grounds of causality  @xcite , it may be deduced that @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the cfw medium for @xmath25 $ ]  nm  @xcite .",
    "cfw disputed this alternative view  @xcite .    in order to resolve the issue ,",
    "two studies were undertaken .",
    "first , following a procedure adopted by wang and lakhtakia  @xcite , we performed a time ",

    "domain maxwell equations for a pulsed plane wave reflected , at normal incidence , from a half  space filled with the cfw medium .",
    "then we transformed the time ",
    "domain electric field of the reflected pulse to the frequency domain and computed the reflectance as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "second , in the frequency domain , we considered a gaussian beam propagating through a slab of the cfw medium at an oblique angle . the reflection and transmission coefficients",
    "were computed    without utilizing the refractive index    by solving the reflection ",
    "transmission problem as a boundary  value problem , and the deflection of the transmitted beam with respect to the incident beam was determined .",
