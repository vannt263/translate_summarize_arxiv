    "the distribution of the number of produced hadrons ( the multiplicity distribution , for short ) provides a basic means to characterize the events .",
    "the multiplicity distribution contains information about multiparticle correlations in an integrated form , providing a general and sensitive means to probe the dynamics of the interaction . here",
    ", we would like to review the main theoretical approaches and experimental results concerning hadron multiplicities .",
    "much precise experimental information on multiplicities has become available in recent years from e@xmath0e@xmath1 , hadron , and nucleus collisions .",
    "the experimental progress has stimulated additional theoretical developments .",
    "therefore , the time seems appropriate for a review .",
    "the theoretical results summarized here represent an expanded and updated version of an earlier work  @xcite .    after introducing basic definitions and notation in section  [ sec - definitions ]",
    ", we turn in section  [ sec - phenomenology ] to describe some phenomenological approaches to multiplicity .",
    "the phenomenological methods are based on simplified ideas about particle emission , exploiting widely used distributions from probability theory ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . among them , the negative binomial distribution is especially popular because it describes experimental data reasonably well for various reactions over a wide energy interval .",
    "the discovery of asymptotic freedom , in conjunction with the parton model used to characterize deep inelastic and e@xmath0e@xmath1 data , led to the development of the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "qcd provides a means to apply perturbative techniques to hadronic processes with large transferred momenta , with quarks and gluons playing the role of partons  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the current state of affairs concerning multiplicity in quark and gluon jets as predicted by qcd and measured by experiment forms the bulk of our review , presented in sections  [ sec - equations]-[sec - heavy ] .",
    "lattice calculations imply that hadronization   the transition of quarks and gluons to hadrons at the final stage of evolution   is an inherent property of qcd . nonetheless , we are still unable to treat hadronization in an unambiguous manner since the problem of confinement has yet to be solved mathematically .",
    "simplified estimates suggest either that hadronization does not drastically alter the parton level results or else that its effects can be estimated from the energy dependence of experimental observables .",
    "phenomenologically , the distributions of partons and hadrons are often found to be remarkably similar .",
    "this implies that the study of the partonic stage of an event is of utmost importance since the properties of high energy multihadronic events are primarily determined at that level .",
    "the probabilistic equations of qcd for the parton cascade can be solved within the perturbative approach .",
    "the parton shower framework allows the use of sub - series of the perturbative expansion , with terms ordered according to their energy behavior .",
    "the zero order approximation already involves an arbitrary number of produced particles .",
    "higher order approximations lead to detailed predictions for multiplicity distributions which can be tested through comparison with experiment . before proceeding to details in the following sections , however , we wish to note two problematic areas and then briefly comment on the main topics we address .    first , qcd yields results on partons , and not hadrons , as already mentioned .",
    "therefore an assumption about hadronization must be made in any comparison of experiment with theory .",
    "a common assumption is local parton - hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite , which states that parton distributions are simply renormalized in the process of hadronization , without changing their shape .",
    "lphd originated from the idea of soft preconfinement  @xcite , whereby partons group in colorless clusters without disturbing the initial spectra .",
    "phenomenological models of hadronization have been incorporated into monte carlo simulations of inelastic processes and in most cases support the approximate property of lphd .",
    "second , perturbative analysis has limitations in the context of any specific approximation . formally speaking",
    ", perturbation theory should be used only when the coupling constant is very small compared to unity .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by qcd only for extremely large transferred momenta , however , often for energies much larger than present experimental conditions . in any qcd process , the energies of cascading partons degrade during their evolution , and a proper accounting for soft partons , their recoil due to interaction , and energy - momentum conservation laws , should be included .",
    "all these considerations are neglected in the lowest order approximation , for which only processes with a rather large gradient of energies and emission angles at each stage of the evolution are considered ( the so - called double - logarithmic approximation , dla ) .",
    "account is taken of soft partons and strict transverse momentum ordering in subsequent terms of the perturbative series , such as the modified leading - logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) .",
    "recoil effects and conservation laws can be incorporated at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( 3nlo ) , and higher order stages .",
    "the conservation laws are more accurately included , the higher the order of the perturbative approximation .    in most cases",
    "these corrections are under control , being about 10 - 20% percent of the main terms at present energies . in spite of their rather small total contribution , they are often very important and change the qualitative theoretical description in regions where the corresponding functions are small . for example , they are crucial for the proper description of the multiparticle production process .",
    "this manifests itself mathematically as a new expansion parameter equal to the product of the qcd coupling constant ( or , more precisely , of its square root ) and the rank of the moment of the distribution .",
    "thus it is for large ranks , i.e.  high multiplicities , that the corrections are most important .",
    "these problems are discussed in detail in sections  [ sec - equations]-[sec - exactsolutions ] .",
    "the first results on the multiplicity distributions of partons were obtained using the double - logarithmic approximation ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "they yielded asymptotic koba - nielsen - olesen ( kno ) scaling  @xcite . according to the kno hypothesis  @xcite",
    ", the multiplicity distribution depends only on the ratio of the number of particles to the average multiplicity ( see section  [ sec - phenomenology ] ) .",
    "kno scaling failed to be valid in the higher order approximations , however , i.e.  the asymptotic realm is too far from present energies . at the same time",
    ", the width of the asymptotic kno function was found to be much larger than experimental distributions .",
    "this problem was resolved  @xcite through consideration of the higher order effects mentioned above .",
    "the increase of average multiplicity with energy was found to depend on the coupling constant in a manner which is faster than any logarithmic function and slower than any power - like one ( if the running coupling constant is used ) , in agreement with experimental findings .",
    "one can now state that an overall agreement between theory and data has been achieved , at least qualitatively .",
    "moreover , some qualitative predictions of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) were found to be unexpectedly well suited for `` soft '' hadronic processes as well .",
    "given the large value of the expansion parameter at small scales , this may seem puzzling .",
    "however , higher order corrections should account for ever softer partons in a consistent manner , implying a more general correspondence between soft and hard processes than is usually considered in theoretical schemes .",
    "for example , the newly discovered feature of the oscillation of cumulant moments ( see section  [ sec - hoapprox ] ) , prompted by solutions of the qcd equations , were experimentally observed in e@xmath0e@xmath1 , hadron- , and nucleus - induced reactions .",
    "these oscillations were found to be extremely sensitive to small details of the multiplicity distributions .",
    "many discussions are devoted to the value of the ratio of average multiplicities between gluon and quark jets ,  @xmath2 .",
    "the value obtained in the double - logarithmic approximation is  @xmath2=9/4 .",
    "the simplest corrections reduce this value by about  10% . an even larger decrease of @xmath2 is predicted by the exact solution of the equations for the generating functions in the case of a fixed coupling constant , by the analytic higher order approximations with a running coupling constant , and by computer solutions of these equations .",
    "these results are discussed in sections  [ sec - psolutions]-[sec - exactsolutions ] .",
    "a proper accounting for the boundary between the perturbative and non - perturbative regions appears to be crucial for this quantity .",
    "the energy dependence of the average multiplicities , i.e.  their slopes , is considered in section  [ sec - psolutions ] .",
    "the ratios of the slopes and of the corresponding curvatures are found to be less sensitive to higher order corrections than the ratio of multiplicities itself . some attempts to account for non - perturbative effects in evolving jets",
    "are briefly described in section  [ sec - nonperturbative ] .",
    "the behavior of the moments of multiplicity is strongly influenced by the nature of the singularities of the generating function , which are not yet known .",
    "approaches to this problem are discussed in section  [ sec - singularities ] .",
    "experimental measurements of multiplicity as they relate to tests of the qcd predictions are described in section  [ sec - experiment ] .",
    "especially noteworthy are recent data from e@xmath0e@xmath1 annihilation experiments operating on the z@xmath3 peak , namely the four experiments aleph , delphi , l3 and opal at the lep storage ring at cern and the sld experiment at the slc collider at slac .",
    "the simplicity of the hadronic production process in e@xmath0e@xmath1 events , along with the large data samples collected by these experiments , has resulted in an unprecedented level of experimental precision for multiplicity related quantities , leading to the possibility , for example , of examining multiplicity in small phase space windows .",
    "recent progress in distinguishing quark and gluon jets by these experiments has made it possible to study their properties separately .",
    "in particular , the multiplicity distributions for each set have recently been analyzed for the first time  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of jets can be studied by resolving subjets , and by determining the subjet multiplicity rate as a function of the resolution scale .",
    "theoretical and experiment results on subjet multiplicities are described in section  [ sec - subjets ] .",
    "this is followed in section  [ sec - threejets ] by a brief discussion of particle multiplicity in e@xmath0e@xmath1 three - jet events .",
    "it is of interest to study multiplicity not only in total phase space but also in small subregions .",
    "these studies are generally focused on the intermittency phenomenon and on the fractality of particle distributions within a selected phase space volume ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) , related to a relative widening of the multiplicity distribution for smaller phase space volumes .",
    "intermittency gives rise to an increase of multiplicity moments in a power - like manner as the phase space window decreases .",
    "such tendencies have been experimentally observed .",
    "quantum chromodynamics provides a qualitative description of the increase of the moments , relates the intermittency exponents ( or fractal dimensions ) directly to the qcd anomalous dimension ( i.e.  the coupling constant ) , and clearly delineates the region of applicability of the regularities , indicating the scales at which one should consider the coupling constant to be running or at which it can be treated as approximately fixed .",
    "theoretical and experimental aspects of intermittency and fractality are described in section  [ sec - intermittency ] .",
    "a deeper understanding of specific features of multiplicity can be gained if inclusive distributions of particles and their mutual correlations are considered .",
    "the quantum mechanical origin of the interacting partons reveals itself in various interference effects .",
    "they lead to the hump - backed plateau of rapidity distributions , to correlations of partons in energies and azimuthal angles , to the string ( or drag ) effect in three - jet events , and to interference phenomena in the production of heavy bosons and lepton pairs at large transverse momenta .",
    "we do not describe these results here , instead referring the reader to monographs  @xcite and to a recent review  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we discuss one interference effect , namely the suppression of the forward production of accompanying particles in processes with heavy quarks . inclusion of this topic is justified here because it directly affects the relation between the mean multiplicities in heavy- and light - quark jets .",
    "a summary of theoretical and experimental results on multiplicity in heavy quark jets is given in section  [ sec - heavy ] .    to keep this review to a reasonable length",
    ", we do not describe the interactions of hadrons , nuclei or polarized quarks except in passing .",
    "these topics merit their own review .",
    "our main purpose is to present a coherent , updated overview of the theoretical and experimental status of multiplicity in high energy hadron jets .",
    "we apologize to the authors of papers whose contributions have not been mentioned .",
    "these omissions are unintentional .",
    "the multiplicity distribution is defined by the formula @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cross section of an @xmath6-particle production process ( the so - called topological cross section ) , @xmath7 is the inelastic cross section , and the sum is over all possible values of @xmath6 so that @xmath8 it is often more convenient to represent the multiplicity distribution by its moments , i.e.  by another set of numbers obtained from it by a definite algorithm .",
    "all such sets can be obtained from the so - called generating function defined by the formula @xmath9 which substitutes an analytic function of @xmath10 in place of the set of numbers @xmath11 at a fixed energy @xmath12 .    in what follows",
    ", use will often be made of the ( normalized ) factorial moments @xmath13 and cumulants @xmath14 determined from the generating function @xmath15 by the relations @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average multiplicity .",
    "the expression for @xmath15 can be written as @xmath19 @xmath20 the distribution @xmath21 and its ordinary moments @xmath22 can be derived from the generating function @xmath15 using the formulas @xmath23 @xmath24 all the moments are connected by definite relations that can be derived from their definitions given above .",
    "for example , the factorial moments and cumulants are related to each other through the identities @xmath25 which are nothing other than the relations between the derivatives of a function and its logarithm at the point where the function itself equals unity . here",
    "@xmath26 are the binomial coefficients , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the gamma and beta functions , respectively .",
    "there are only numerical coefficients in the recurrence relations  ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "therefore iterative solution yields all cumulants if the factorial moments are given , and vice versa . in this sense ,",
    "cumulants and factorial moments are equally suitable .",
    "the relations between them for the lowest ranks are @xmath29    the physical meaning of these moments can be seen from their definitions if they are presented in the form of integrals of correlation functions ( for a review , see ref .",
    "let the single symbol @xmath12 represent all kinematic variables needed to specify the position of each particle in the phase space volume  @xmath30 .",
    "a sequence of inclusive @xmath31-particle differential cross sections @xmath32 defines the factorial moments in the following manner : @xmath33 therefore , the factorial moments include in integrated form all correlations within the system of particles under consideration .",
    "the corresponding expressions for cumulants are more complicated as can be seen from relations  ( [ 11 ] ) and  ( [ 12a ] )",
    ". therefore we do not present them here but instead remark that analogous relations exist in quantum field theory where formulas similar to eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and  ( [ 5 ] ) define the complete set of feynman graphs ( both connected and disconnected ) and the subset of connected diagrams , respectively ( see e.g. ref .",
    "thus , factorial moments represent integral characteristics of any correlation between the particles whereas cumulants of rank @xmath31 represent genuine @xmath31-particle correlations not reducible to the product of lower order correlations . to be more precise",
    ", all @xmath31 particles are connected to each other in the @xmath31th cumulant and can not be split into disconnected groups .",
    "one can say they form a @xmath31-particle cluster which is not divisible into smaller clusters , in analogy with mayer cluster decomposition in statistical mechanics .",
    "it is a common feature of distributions in particle physics that their factorial moments and cumulants increase rapidly as the rank @xmath31 increases .",
    "therefore it is often convenient to consider their ratio introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath34 which does not share this feature . at the same time",
    "the @xmath35 ratios exhibit all the qualitative features of the cumulants . as will be discussed below , the ratios @xmath36 appear in a natural manner as the solution of the qcd equations for the generating functions  @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , one can derive the relation between the factorial moments @xmath37 and the ordinary moments @xmath38 with the same or lower ranks .",
    "the two types of moments are found to differ by terms which depend only on the mean multiplicity so that , for example , @xmath39 thus ordinary and factorial moments have a different energy dependence , since @xmath40 is energy dependent . in general ,",
    "factorial moments differ from ordinary moments by lower order correlation terms suppressed by the inverse power of the mean multiplicity to the corresponding power .",
    "thus ordinary and factorial moments coincide asymptotically .",
    "the generating function contains the same physical information as the multiplicity distribution .",
    "this information is also contained in the unnormalized moments and their ratio . for normalized moments , the average multiplicity at a given energy also needs to be specified .",
    "note that higher rank moments emphasize higher multiplicity events , i.e.  multiplicities @xmath41 contribute to factorial moments of ( integer ) rank @xmath31 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "if the distribution is truncated at some @xmath42=@xmath43 , all factorial moments with rank @xmath44 are zero , whereas they are positive for smaller  @xmath31 . the cumulants may be either positive or negative if the distribution is truncated .",
    "an emphasis on low multiplicity events can be made by considering derivatives of the generating functions at @xmath10=-1 .",
    "for example , the so - called combinants  @xcite , defined by @xmath45 measure correlations within the low multiplicity part of the distribution .    of potential interest would be moments with an exponentially damped high - multiplicity tail , defined by @xmath46 ( see the expression for the ordinary moments @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) ) .",
    "events with multiplicity @xmath42=@xmath31 are enhanced in these moments .",
    "this type of moment has not yet been studied , however .    to this point",
    "we have assumed that the rank of a moment is a positive integer .",
    "however , the definitions ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) can be easily generalized to non - integer moments  @xcite , by re - expressing the factorial moments as @xmath47 which is valid for any real value of  @xmath31 .",
    "this result can also be obtained using a more general approach , by forming the derivative of any real order @xmath31 of the generating function , i.e.  by using fractional calculus .",

    "@xcite , @xcite-@xcite for further discussion .",
    "the method of generating functions is a particular realization of the more general method of generating functionals .",
    "the latter approach considers the probability to find a certain @xmath6-particle distribution inside the phase space volume , in place of @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , and therefore utilizes functions @xmath49 instead of the variable  @xmath10 , where the @xmath50 depend on the phase space variables  @xmath51 .",

    "( [ 12b ] ) . for more details , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "a principal phenomenological issue is the energy dependence of multiplicity for different colliding particles and nuclei .",
    "one of the most successful assumptions about the shape of the multiplicity distribution at high energies is the hypothesis that its energy dependence is determined by the average multiplicity in such a manner that @xmath48 may be represented as : @xmath53 this property is called kno scaling after the names of its authors  @xcite , who proposed it on the basis of the feynman plateau of rapidity distributions .",
    "earlier , a similar relation was obtained in the framework of conformal field theories  @xcite .",
    "kno scaling is usually considered to be an asymptotic property , i.e.  valid in the limit @xmath54 .",

    "( [ 14 ] ) for @xmath59 , tending to constant values only at asymptotically high energies .",
    "constancy of the factorial moments is called @xmath52 scaling . therefore @xmath52  scaling coincides with kno scaling asymptotically .",
    "the generating function depends on the average multiplicity in both cases as seen from the definitions ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) and  ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "if feynman scaling is approximate , kno scaling is violated , suggesting the replacement of eq .",

    "the multiplicity distributions in these models are not usually described by a single analytic formula but are formed from a combination of distributions .",

    "another important consideration in the comparison of theory with hadron - hadron data is that the phase space is relatively unoccupied in typical events , i.e. for events with multiplicities close to the mean , because the phase space volume is proportional to the primary energy @xmath155 whereas the mean multiplicity increases more slowly , as @xmath156 according to perturbative qcd or as a power of @xmath157 according to some phenomenological models . at present , we describe these data using peripheral - like ladder type processes with reggeons or reggeized gluon exchange .",

    "the situation in e@xmath0e@xmath1 annihilations followed a similar path , with suggestions at low energies that kno scaling was valid followed by observations at higher energies that it was not .",
    "a shoulder structure in the multiplicity distribution , similar to that observed in hadron collisions , was also observed here .",

    "a universal energy dependence of average multiplicities in reactions initiated by different particles was proposed  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the scale for hadron - initiated reactions should be the so - called effective energy , obtained by subtracting the energy of leading particles from the total event energy .",
