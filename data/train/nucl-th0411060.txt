    "while the simplicity and elegance of qcd is very appealing theoretically , the phenomenological observations of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and of the confinement of colour charges turned it into a major calculational nightmare : it took almost twenty years after the discovery of asymptotic freedom in 1973 to convincingly demonstrate that the qcd lagrangian indeed implies these highly non - trivial collective phenomena .",
    "this was done by means of numerical simulation .    in such lattice simulations",
    ", qcd is regularised by introducing a lattice cut - off @xmath0 .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath1 parameters of the theory , i.e.  qcd coupling and quark masses are matched to reproduce @xmath1 hadron masses .",
    "everything else is a prediction and in this sense lattice qcd is a _ first principles _ approach .",
    "the confinement of colour implies that finite size effects are usually tiny , as long as the spatial box extent @xmath2 .",
    "we are also fortunate to find that lattice spacings @xmath3  4  gev are sufficiently small to allow for controlled continuum limit extrapolations , @xmath4 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 is sufficient , which makes qcd tractable on computers .",
    "this need not be so . if for instance we were to attempt a brute force calculation of the deuteron binding energy of about 2  mev then resolving the large scale difference with respect to the nucleon mass of almost a factor of 50 would require both , a huge volume and incredible statistical accuracy .",
    "of course such scale hierarchies indicate that direct calculations should be avoidable as they lend themselves to an effective field theory treatment .",
    "we will discuss progress on computational problems in sec .",
    "[ sec : cost ] , before summarising recent lattice studies of multiquark hadron spectroscopy in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] and of the nucleon structure in sec .",
    "[ sec : nucleon ] .",
    "on a lattice with @xmath6 points , the lattice dirac operator is a huge matrix of dimension @xmath7 .",
    "the inversion of this operator represents the major computational task of lattice qcd and this makes simulations incorporating sea quarks notoriously expensive .",
    "the algorithmic cost explodes with small @xmath8 masses , @xmath9 .",
    "a smaller @xmath10 also requires a larger spatial lattice volume and the scaling behaviour , keeping @xmath11 fixed , is even worse : @xmath12 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] we display recent results obtained by the lhp and sesam collaborations  @xcite on the quark contribution @xmath13 to the proton spin , in the @xmath14 scheme at a scale @xmath15  gev , for @xmath16 .",
    "the normalisation is such that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the contribution from the quark angular momentum and @xmath19 from the gluons .",
    "similar results have been obtained by the qcdsf collaboration  @xcite . in these simulations , @xmath20  mev .",
    "we took the liberty to convert the mass scale into units of our choice .",
    "obviously , for infinite quark masses we expect @xmath21 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the experimental value is overestimated .",
    "however , it is clear from the figure that smaller quark masses are absolutely essential to allow for a meaningful chiral extrapolation . fortunately , with the advent of new fermion formulations  @xcite that respect an exact lattice chiral symmetry , a reduction of the quark mass towards values @xmath22  mev has become possible recently  @xcite , albeit so far only in the quenched approximation .",

    "the @xmath23 content of the ground state is shown , in terms of a mixing angle .",

    "content of the ground state is shown , in terms of a mixing angle .",
    "the results apply to @xmath16 , @xmath24 and @xmath25  fm  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in many lattice calculations it is sufficient to calculate quark propagators that originate from a fixed source point . in these cases",
    "only one column of the inverse dirac matrix needs to be calculated , navely reducing the effort by a factor @xmath26 . in some cases diagrams with disconnected quark lines",
    "are needed .",
    "examples are the physics of flavour singlet mesons , strong decays as well as parton distributions ( pds ) . in the latter case the complication can be avoided by assuming @xmath27 isospin symmetry and only calculating differences between @xmath28 and @xmath29 quark distributions .",
    "disconnected quark lines require all - to - all propagators and hence a complete inversion of the dirac matrix appears necessary .",
    "this turns out to be prohibitively expensive in terms of memory and computer time .",
    "fortunately , sophisticated noise reduced stochastic estimator techniques have been developed over the past few years and as a result tremendous progress was achieved .",
    "one such benchmark is the qcd string breaking problem , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a static quark , which represents one of the cleanest examples of a strong decay . within both , the transition matrix element as well as the @xmath23 state all - to - all propagators are required . in fig .",
    "[ fig : break ] we display the result of a recent sesam collaboration study  @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation to physical light quark masses yields a string breaking distance @xmath33  fm .",
    "the gap between the two states in the string breaking region is @xmath34  mev and we are able to resolve this with a resolution of 10 standard deviations !    in conclusion , all the long standing killers @xmath35 , @xmath36 and all - to - all propagators have been successfully tackled .",
    "however , we are still a few years away from overcoming two of them at the same time and possibly almost a decade separates us from simulations of flavour singlet diagrams with realistically light sea quarks . in most cases",
    "not all these ingredients are required simultaneously .",
    "while bigger computers are always needed , most of the recent progress would have been impossible without novel methods .",
    "the gain factor from faster computers was almost 5,000 over the past 15 years .",
    "the factor from theoretical and algorithmic advances is harder to quantify .",
    "two such examples have been mentioned : chiral lattice fermions and all - to - all propagator techniques .",
    "qcd goes beyond the quark model and hence hadronic states that do not fit into a nave quark model of @xmath37 mesons and @xmath38 baryons are of particular interest .",
    "many of the observed hadrons will contain considerable non - quark model components , in particular within the scalar sector .",
    "obviously , quantum numbers that are incomprehensible with a quark model meson or baryon interpretation provide us with the most clean - cut distinction .",
    "such examples do exist in the review of particle properties , namely the @xmath39 mesons @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the minimal configuration required to obtain a vector state with positive charge either consists of two quarks and two antiquarks ( tetraquark / molecule ) or of quark , antiquark and a gluonic excitation ( hybrid meson ) .",
    "unfortunately , these resonances are rather broad with a width @xmath42  300  mev which might be one of the reasons why they are often ignored",
    ". however , the ratio @xmath43 is very much the same as for the ( quark model ) @xmath44 meson .",
    "another clear indication of an @xmath45 nature would for instance be a baryonic state with strangeness @xmath46 .",
    "the minimal quark configuration in this case consists of five quarks ( pentaquark ) : @xmath47 .",
    "it is no secret that over the past two years several experiments have presented evidence of a very narrow @xmath48 resonance , with decay @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the parity has not yet been established .",
    "however the mass is about 100  mev above the @xmath51 threshold and for @xmath52 an @xmath53-wave decay is possible , which is difficult to reconcile with a width @xmath54  mev .",
    "for @xmath55 a @xmath56-wave is required , still a bit puzzling but less so .",
    "as the main decay channel does not require sea quarks one might hope to gain some insight from quenched lattice simulations and several attempts have been made  @xcite .",
    "two groups  @xcite also investigated charmed pentaquarks and two studies  @xcite incorporated the @xmath57 sector , in addition to @xmath58 .",
    "two groups  @xcite employed chiral overlap fermions while the others used conventional wilson - type lattice quarks .",
    "only the kentucky group  @xcite went down to @xmath22  mev while all other @xmath8 masses were larger than 400  mev .",
    "the budapest - wuppertal group  @xcite varied the lattice spacing and attempted a continuum - limit extrapolation . in all studies the negative parity mass came out to be lighter than the positive parity one , which is expected in the heavy quark limit .",
    "there are two crucial questions to be asked : what happens when realistic light quark masses are approached ?",
    "do we see resonant or scattering states ? resolving a resonance sitting on top of a tower of @xmath51 scattering states with different relative momenta appears rather hopeless at first . however , there are two discovery tools available : variation of the lattice volume and of the creation operator . by varying the volume",
    "one will change the spectrum of @xmath51 scattering states as well as the coupling of a given operator to @xmath51 ( the spectral weight ) .",
    "if the pentaquark really was such a narrow resonance as some experiments suggest then maybe a lattice operator can be constructed that has a large overlap with this state but only a very small coupling to @xmath51 . for the @xmath55 state which can only decay into a @xmath56-wave ,",
    "the mass of the scattering state will depend on the lattice size since the smallest possible non - vanishing lattice momentum is @xmath59 . for @xmath60 the volume dependence of the lowest scattering state mass will be weak , however",
    ", the scaling of the spectral weight with the volume can still provide us with a hint .",
    "mass dependence of @xmath58 @xmath47 `` pentaquark '' masses  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    mass dependence of @xmath58 @xmath47 `` pentaquark '' masses  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it turns out that the situation on the lattice is at least as ambiguous as the one encountered in experiment . to demonstrate this we display some kentucky results  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : penta ] .",
    "it appears that the @xmath60 state dominantly couples to an @xmath53-wave @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath55 however displays the qualitative volume dependence of a @xmath56-wave but does not share its mass .",
    "interpretation as a @xmath56-wave plus some linear momentum is a likely possibility . at very small",
    "@xmath10 the situation becomes further complicated by the fact that there is no axial anomaly in the quenched approximation .",
    "hence the flavour singlet @xmath61 is degenerate with the @xmath8 .",
    "as this contribution comes in with a negative spectral weight , it is sometimes labelled as a `` ghost '' .",
    "the @xmath55 state can contain such a @xmath62 @xmath53-wave ( dashed lines ) .",
    "while the @xmath60 state becomes indistinguishable form a @xmath51 , the @xmath63 _ might _ contain a resonant component . in order to arrive at more definite conclusions a variation of the creation operator as well as of",
    "the volume appears necessary , which is a very ambitious project . nonetheless , the lattice results obtained so far are quite instructive",
    ".    lattice studies of diquark interactions in a simplified , more controlled environment represent an alternative strategy to the brute force simulation of unstable states . a baryon with one static and two light quarks constitutes one such arena .",
    "one can of course also investigate multiquark interactions in the nonrelativistic limit of infinitely heavy quark masses .",
    "such tetra- and penta - quark potentials have been studied recently by two groups  @xcite and the results might provide model builders with some insight .",
    "however , it is not clear how to relate these findings to the light quark limit in which chiral symmetry appears to play a bigger rle than instantaneous confining forces .",
    "there exist quite a few narrow resonances very close to strong decay thresholds like the @xmath64 , the recently discovered @xmath65 charmonium state and the @xmath66 system .",
    "it is very conceivable that such states contain a sizable multiquark component .",
    "the question then arises if these constitute would - be quark model states or if these are true molecules / multiquark - states , that appear _ in addition _ to the quark model spectrum .",
    "a fantastic arena to address this was provided by the recently discovered ( probably scalar ) @xmath67 and ( probably axialvector ) @xmath68 states .",
    "first lattice studies  @xcite have been performed , with somewhat contradictory interpretations of very compatible results .",
    "one might hope that a similar effort will be dedicated on the comparatively cleaner and easier question of tetraquarks as has been on the pentaquark studies .",
    "the obvious strength of lattice studies lies in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "calculations of hadronic matrix elements are more involved . however , once light sea quarks are included , many states become unstable and it turns out that calculating internal properties of stable particles is easier than resolving the strong decay dynamics of resonances .",
    "this should also be clear from the pentaquark discussion above . in view of this , the phenomenologically most exciting lattice input to be expected in the next few years should be calculations of the hadron structure .",
    "quite a few results on moments of generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) , most notably from the qcdsf  @xcite , sesam and lhp collaborations  @xcite , exist and the lattice method is already very competitive in this area which is experimentally very challenging , in particular when it comes to transversity distributions .",
    "these new simulations build upon the methods that have been developed and successfully used in the context of calculations of unpolarised and polarised pds .",
    "possibly the biggest systematic uncertainty in these past studies was the chiral extrapolation , down to physical @xmath10 .     of the proton quark distribution with wilson fermions ( left ) and with overlap fermions ( right )  @xcite , in the @xmath14 scheme at 2  gev .",
    "the units are @xmath69  mev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    of the proton quark distribution with wilson fermions ( left ) and with overlap fermions ( right )  @xcite , in the @xmath14 scheme at 2  gev .",
    "the units are @xmath69  mev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in particular the lowest moment of the unpolarised distribution , @xmath70,\\ ] ] turned out to be overestimated by almost 60  % if linearly extrapolated in @xmath71 , both without and with sea quarks  @xcite .",
    "chiral perturbation theory predicts deviations from such a linear behaviour and there is some room for inventive extrapolations  @xcite .",
    "however , even at @xmath72  mev there is no sign of a bending towards the chiral limit  @xcite as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] . in the right part of the figure the study is repeated with chiral overlap fermions which protect against mixing with lower dimensional lattice operators , down to @xmath73  mev . in this case no non - perturbative renormalisation to an intermediate mom scheme is available as yet .",
    "however , in the wilson case the difference between purely perturbative and ( partly ) non - perturbative renormalisation was negligible .",
    "this is potentially exciting news which probably will receive clarification during the coming year .    finally , there has also been progress in resolving the momentum dependence of electromagnetic @xmath74 transition form factors in a quenched study  @xcite , in the region @xmath75 .",
    "the magnetic dipole form factor is significantly overestimated at large @xmath76 , due to the unrealistically small charge radii of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "one might hope that such effects cancel in part from form factor ratios .",
    "@xmath79 is fairly constant at -0.02(1 ) , once extrapolated to the chiral limit .",
    "in contrast , @xmath80 decreases monotonously from -0.01(1 ) at 0.1  gev@xmath81 down to -0.09(3 ) at @xmath82 .",
    "this behaviour is in good agreement with @xmath83 clas data  @xcite while it is hard to reconcile with the oops point  @xcite , @xmath84\\,\\%$ ] at @xmath85 .",
    "lattice calculations have made a lot of progress recently .",
    "many studies now include sea quarks . within the quenched approximation",
    ", light quark masses close to the physical limit have been realised and the lattice provides a powerful tool for exploring the validity range of chiral expansions .",
    "there has also been tremendous progress in the calculation of diagrams with disconnected quark lines which are for instance needed to understand strong decay processes and flavour singlet contributions .",
    "a lot of work still needs to be done .",
