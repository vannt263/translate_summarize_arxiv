    "triangular - lattice antiferromagnets ( tlafs ) , which are a paradigmatic example of geometric frustration , have received renewed interest  @xcite in recent years owing to the technical developments in high - field experiments and the appearance of new materials comprising co@xmath4 magnetic ions , such as ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite and ba@xmath0conb@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite . unlike other typical tlaf compounds with cu@xmath4 ions , such as cs@xmath1cucl@xmath5 and cs@xmath1cubr@xmath5  @xcite",
    ", the co - based compounds can form regular ( undistorted ) triangular - lattice layers and are free from a large antisymmetric interaction of the dzyaloshinsky - moriya type thanks to the highly symmetric crystal structure .",
    "the physics of those compounds is expected to be described by a simple model hamiltonian .",
    "recently , shirata @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite reported that the magnetization curve of ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2 powder seems to show excellent agreement with theoretical calculations on the spin-1/2 isotropic heisenberg model on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular lattice  @xcite .",
    "this is owing to the fact that the magnetic layers of co@xmath4 ions are well separated from each other by a nonmagnetic layer  @xcite .",
    "however , the latest experiments with the use of single crystals  @xcite found a field - direction dependence of magnetization curve , which indicates the existence of exchange anisotropy , and a magnetization anomaly that had not been predicted at a strong magnetic field @xmath8 t perpendicular to the @xmath9 axis .",
    "several conjectures have been proposed for the origin of the unexpected high - field anomaly in the magnetization curve  @xcite .    in our previous study",
    "@xcite , we have provided a microscopic model calculation for the magnetization process of the quasi-2d tlaf ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2 by taking into account the easy - plane exchange anisotropy and weak couplings between layers . the theoretical magnetization curve under in - plane magnetic field exhibits a field - induced first - order transition at @xmath10 of the saturation field @xmath11 as well as the well - known plateau structure at the one - third of the saturation magnetization . from the result",
    ", we suggested that the origin of the magnetization anomaly observed in ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2 is indeed the extra first - order transition due to the weak interlayer coupling .",
    "in fact , the critical field strength ( @xmath8 t ) at the anomaly is well accorded with our theoretical prediction ( @xmath12  @xcite ) , given that the saturation field of ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2 is about @xmath13 t  @xcite .    in ref .  , we focused on the system with easy - plane exchange anisotropy in order to explain a specific experiment . in this paper",
    ", we give a quantitative study on quantum tlafs based on the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian , which is a simpler but more fundamental model to describe spin systems .",
    "even for the simple heisenberg model on a single layer of triangular lattice , there have been only a few numerical studies  @xcite that can reproduce the quantum stabilization of the magnetization plateau .",
    "this is due to the difficulty in treating strongly frustrated quantum systems .",
    "also in experiments , there are only a few quantum tlaf materials that actually exhibit a clear magnetization plateau  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is still important to reproduce the plateau of the isotropic tlaf by different theoretical methods , whose reliability can in turn be confirmed by their accurate prediction of the plateau .",
    "we apply our numerical cluster mean - field approach with a scaling scheme ( cmf+s )  @xcite to the @xmath14 heisenberg model on a triangular lattice .",
    "the result for a single layer shows that the numerical cmf+s method provides an excellent quantitative agreement with previous numerical results  @xcite , including the quantum stabilization of the one - third magnetization plateau .",
    "we also present the cmf+s results for the magnetization and susceptibility curves in the presence of antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling .",
    "it is shown that a small interlayer coupling gives rise to an extra discontinuous quantum phase transition at a strong field @xmath15 .",
    "the high - field first - order transition is clearly visible as a divergence in the susceptibility while the shape of the magnetization curve undergoes very little change except for quite a small jump at the transition point .",
    "( a ) weakly - coupled layers of triangular lattice .",
    "( b ) a three - sublattice spin structure expected on a triangular lattice . the spins on the sites with the same letter points in the same direction . ( c ) a six - sublattice spin structure on a layered triangular lattice . ]    the hamiltonian of the heisenberg model on layers of triangular lattice [ see fig .  [ figtlaf](a ) ] is given by @xmath16 where both the intralayer ( @xmath17 ) and interlayer ( @xmath18 ) nearest - neighbor ( nn ) couplings are assumed to be antiferromagnetic .",
    "we investigate the @xmath14 case that exhibits the strongest quantum fluctuations .    for a single layer of triangular lattice ( or @xmath19 )",
    ", the ground - state spin configuration usually forms a three - sublattice structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtlaf](b ) as long as the system only has spatially isotropic nn interactions . however , real tlaf compounds such as ba@xmath0cosb@xmath1o@xmath2 have a quasi-2d structure that consists of magnetic triangular - lattice layers separated from each other by a nonmagnetic layer  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has to consider a small but finite interlayer interaction @xmath18 between spins on different layers . for a ferromagnetic @xmath20 , it is expected that the spins along the stacking direction tend to point in the same direction and the three - sublattice spin configuration on each layer is more stabilized .",
    "a quite small @xmath21 can be thus negligible when the magnetic layers are well separated .",
    "however , we will show that when @xmath22 , even a small interlayer interaction could play an essential role in determining the ground - state spin configuration of tlafs under magnetic field .",
    "the consideration of this effect due to weak three dimensionality is a key to quantitatively describe quasi-2d quantum tlaf compounds with a microscopic model hamiltonian .",
    "the classical counterpart of the model ( @xmath23 ) is written in terms of three - dimensional vector @xmath24 with a fixed length @xmath25 instead of quantum spin-1/2 operator @xmath26 .",
    "it is known that the ground state of the classical heisenberg model on a 2d triangular lattice ( @xmath19 ) can not be uniquely determined under magnetic field ( @xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "although the classical - spin angles on the three - sublattice structure shown in fig .  [ figtlaf](a ) have six degrees of freedom , the minimization of the classical energy only gives the constraint @xmath28 for @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath30 is the saturation field , above which all the spins are aligned parallel to the magnetic field . except the trivial degeneracy from the @xmath31 symmetry ,",
    "there still remain two degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , spin configurations in the ground - state magnetization process ( @xmath29 ) are continuously degenerate .",
    "the total magnetization per site , @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the number of lattice sites , is given by @xmath34 as a linear function of the magnetic field strength for any magnetization process in the degenerate manifold .",
    "in the quantum spin-1/2 system , however , the classical degeneracy is lifted by quantum fluctuation effects .",
    "for tlafs , it is now established that the sequence of the `` y , '' up - up - down , and 0-coplanar states [ fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] ] is selected as the lowest - energy magnetization process  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization curve @xmath35 is no longer a linear function of @xmath36 , and exhibits a magnetization plateau at one - third of the saturation magnetization reflecting the stabilization of the up - up - down state over a finite range of magnetic field strength .",
    "series of clusters used in the present cmf+s study .",
    "the lower illustrations show the independent clusters that have to be considered under the three - sublattice ansatz in the purely 2d case .",
    "the cluster of @xmath37 , 15 , or 21 is similar to that of @xmath38 . ]",
    "we employ here the cmf+s method  @xcite to take into account the quantum effects and interlayer coupling . in general ,",
    "the number of spins that can be numerically diagonalized on current computer resources is very limited . to avoid strong finite - size effects in such exact diagonalization on small clusters ,",
    "we impose a self - consistent mean - field boundary condition instead of the usual periodic or open one .",
    "first , we approximate the hamiltonian @xmath39 on @xmath33 sites ( @xmath40 in the thermodynamic limit ) by the sum of @xmath41 cluster hamiltonians on a cluster of @xmath42 sites .",
    "the inter - cluster interactions are decoupled as @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , the cluster hamiltonian @xmath45 includes the expectation values @xmath46 as mean fields to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the sublattice magnetic moment @xmath47 on sublattice @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the number of the independent clusters ( specifically given later ) , @xmath52 is the number of total sites belonging to the sublattice @xmath48 in the @xmath51 clusters , and @xmath53 ( we take @xmath54 in the present study ) .",
    "substituting @xmath47 into @xmath55 in @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( [ selfconsistent ] ) becomes a set of self - consistent equations for @xmath47 .",
    "usually , one gets some different sets of solutions for @xmath47 depending on the initial values in the iteration process to solve the self - consistent equations .",
    "the spin configuration of each solution at a given magnetic field strength @xmath36 is identified by the converged values of @xmath47 on each sublattice @xmath48 .",
    "since the energy difference between different spin configurations can be estimated by integrating the magnetization curve @xmath35 ( which is given by the average of @xmath56 over @xmath48 ) with respect to @xmath36 from @xmath11 , one can determine the ground - state magnetization process by comparing the energies of the different solutions .    to efficiently treat possible spin configurations in quasi-2d tlafs , we choose a series of triangular - shaped clusters of up to @xmath57 , displayed in fig .  [ figclusters ] .",
    "the above - mentioned approach reproduces the classical ground state for @xmath58 , and allows for a systematic inclusion of non - local fluctuations as @xmath42 increases .",
    "therefore , we eventually make an extrapolation of the results for different values of @xmath42 to the limit of @xmath59 , where long - range fluctuations in each triangular - lattice layer are fully included .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the number of bonds treated exactly ) varies from 0 for @xmath58 to 1 for @xmath62 .",
    "we first present the cmf+s result for the magnetization curve of the heisenberg model on a single layer of triangular lattice ( @xmath19 ) for comparisons with some known results obtained by other theoretical methods  @xcite . under the assumption of the three - sublattice structure shown in fig .",
    "[ figtlaf](b ) , the number of independent clusters that have to be treated in the cmf+s self - consistent equations ( [ selfconsistent ] ) is @xmath63 for @xmath37 , 6 , 15 , or 21 , while @xmath64 for @xmath65 ( see the lower illustrations of fig .  [ figclusters ] ) .",

    "figmagnetization2d](a ) .",
    "the quantum fluctuations select the sequence of the y , up - up - down , and 0-coplanar states as expected .",
    "the magnetization curve exhibits the one - third quantum magnetization plateau . as the size of the cluster @xmath42 increases ,",
    "the plateau gets wider , indicating that the effects of quantum fluctuations are properly included .",
    "figure  [ figmagnetization2d](b ) shows the critical field strength at each of end points of the plateau ( named @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) as a function of the scaling parameter @xmath68 .",
    "we perform a linear extrapolation @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) of the data calculated with the three largest clusters .",
    "the extrapolated values are given as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "these values are somewhat different from the linear - spin - wave result ( 1.248 and 2.145  @xcite ) and comparable with those obtained by the exact diagonalization with the periodic boundary condition ( 1.38 and 2.16  @xcite ) and by the coupled cluster method ( 1.37 and 2.15  @xcite ) .    in the previous cmf+s study on the @xmath73 hamiltonian  @xcite we derived the phase diagram in the plane of the @xmath73 anisotropy and magnetic field strength by extrapolating the values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath74 at each phase boundary with",
    "@xmath75 fixed .",
    "since we took sufficiently many but necessarily a finite number of @xmath75 values , a further interpolation was needed to obtain the critical fields corresponding to the isotropic heisenberg model , namely to the line @xmath76 .",
    "this procedure gave @xmath77 and @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the values obtained by the present work ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively ) are more accurate for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the more direct scaling procedure for the magnetization curve of the heisenberg model does not require further interpolations .",
    "second , the extrapolation to the infinite - size limit based on the linear fit appears to work even more efficiently for the present treatment ( in which the critical @xmath75 is extrapolated ) compared to the @xmath73 model study ( in which the critical @xmath74 is extrapolated ) .        in order to make cluster - size scaling of the entire magnetization curve @xmath35",
    ", first we have to change the scale of each curve obtained with finite @xmath42 with respect to @xmath36 as @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 so that the phase boundaries for all finite @xmath42 have the same location as those of the limit @xmath69 ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 )  @xcite .",

    "[ figmagnetization2d](d ) .",
    "we can see an excellent agreement of the cmf+s curve with the data extracted from refs .   and  , regarding the locations of the phase transition points and the nonlinear bending due to the quantum effects .",
    "weak three - dimensionality is not avoidable in real quasi-2d tlaf compounds .",
    "since there are numerous nearly - degenerate states in frustrated systems , even very small interlayer interaction can compete with quantum fluctuations and affect the ground - state selection . in the previous study  @xcite , while effects of the interlayer coupling have been discussed with a focus on the case where easy - plane exchange anisotropy exists , we have not explained the detailed magnetization process for the isotropic case .",
    "therefore , here let us discuss the role of interlayer coupling @xmath18 on the magnetization process of the fundamental heisenberg model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in a quantitative way with the use of the cmf+s .    for weakly - coupled triangular - lattice layers ,",

    "if each layer consists of a bipartite lattice , it is expected that the in - plane magnetic order is just stacked alternately as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3d ] .",
    "however , for non - bipartite lattices such as the triangular lattice , the in - plane three - sublattice magnetic order could compete with the demand of antiparallel alignment along the stacking direction . as a result of the incompatibility , the lowest - energy stacking pattern can be changed depending on the magnetic field strength as will be shown below .        for tlafs in the presence of antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling",

    "figure  [ figbranch ] shows the two branches ( a)-(b)-(c)-(d ) and ( a@xmath90)-(b@xmath90)-(c@xmath90 ) . from comparison between ( a ) and ( a@xmath90 ) or between ( b ) and ( b@xmath90 )",
    ", it is obviously seen that the former process has a lower energy for low magnetic fields since @xmath22 favors antiparallel alignment on interlayer bonds .",
    "however , the magnitude relation between the energies of ( c ) and ( c@xmath90 ) at strong fields can be reversed as @xmath36 increases .",
    "note that the relative angles ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ) among the six sublattice magnetic moments are gradually changed as a function of @xmath36 even in the same phase . as can be seen in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ figbranch ] , when the spins are almost collinear , the energy of ( c@xmath90 ) should be higher than that of ( c ) due to the high interlayer bond energy of field - parallel spin components .",

    "[ figmagnetization3d](c ) , the existence of the additional quantum first - order transition is clearly seen in the field derivative of @xmath35 as the divergence at @xmath99 , in contrast to the purely 2d ( @xmath19 ) case .",
    "in summary , we have studied the magnetization process of the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on layered triangular lattice with and without weak interlayer coupling .",
    "our numerical calculations with the cmf+s method properly described the one - third magnetization plateau expected in quantum tlafs and provided a quantitative agreement with the numerical data of the ed  @xcite and the ccm  @xcite for a single layer of triangular lattice .",
    "moreover , we discussed the detailed magnetization process in the presence of weak interlayer coupling , which is unavoidable in real quasi-2d compounds .",
    "we presented the magnetization and susceptibility curves of the isotropic heisenberg model , which was not reported in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "although a small interlayer coupling does not change the apparent shape of the magnetization curve , an additional first - order phase transition occurs at @xmath100 above the one - third plateau .",
    "this extra transition is visible as a small discontinuous jump in the magnetization curve and a divergence in the susceptibility . from a comparison of the present isotropic heisenberg model with the previous easy - plane case  @xcite",
    ", the easy - plane anisotropy seems not to be relevant for the qualitative feature of the magnetization process and the shape of the magnetization curve including the extra first - order transition as long as the magnetic field is applied in the direction parallel to the easy plane . since the appearance of the high - field first - order transition stems from the incompatibility between the in - plane quantum magnetic order and the demand of antiparallel alignment along the stacking direction , a similar magnetization process is expected to be obtained for larger spins , e.g. , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    here , we discussed the case of weak interlayer coupling ( @xmath103 ) employing the cmf+s based on 2d clusters shown in fig .",
    "[ figclusters ] . for larger values of @xmath18 ( @xmath104 ) , it has been predicted for the heisenberg model that the umbrella state is stabilized at strong fields  @xcite .",
