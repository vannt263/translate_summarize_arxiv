    "flares are the energetic explosions in the stellar atmosphere and are thought to occur by intense releases of magnetic energy stored around starspots , like solar flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the total energy released in the largest solar flares is estimated to be of the order of @xmath3 erg ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "superflare \" events have been recently found by using the kepler data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "superflares are gigantic flare events that are 10-@xmath4 times more energetic ( @xmath5 erg ; @xcite ) than the largest solar flares on the sun ( @xmath6erg ) .",
    "we have analyzed the data from kepler space telescope @xcite , and discovered 365 superflare events on 148 solar - type ( g - type main - sequence ) stars from the data of 83,000 solar - type stars observed for the first 120 days of the kepler mission @xcite .",
    "we here define solar - type stars as the stars that have a surface temperature of @xmath7k and a surface gravity of @xmath8 . extending the study of @xcite",
    ", we found 1547 superflare events on 279 solar - type stars by using the kepler data of a longer period ( @xmath9500 days ) @xcite .",
    "kepler is very useful for detecting small increases in the stellar brightness caused by stellar flares , because kepler realized high photometric precision exceeding 0.01% for moderately bright stars , and obtained continuous time - series data of many stars over a long period @xcite .",
    "+   +  the analyses of kepler data enabled us to discuss statistical properties of superflares since a very large number of flare events were discovered .",
    "@xcite confirmed that the occurrence rate ( @xmath10 ) of the superflare versus the flare energy ( @xmath11 ) has a power - law distribution of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and this distribution is roughly similar to that for the solar flare .",
    "@xcite also estimated that a superflare with an energy of @xmath14 erg occurs once in 800 - 5000 years in sun - like stars .  sun - like stars \" are here defined as solar - type stars with an effective temperature of @xmath15k , a surface gravity of @xmath8 , and a rotation period ( @xmath16 ) longer than 10 days .",
    "+   +  considering these results , we have performed more analyses in order to investigate whether properties of superflare stars can be explained by applying our current physical understanding of the sun .",
    "solar flares are the intense releases of magnetic energy stored around sunspots , as mentioned above .",
    "if we assume superflares are the similar magnetic energy releases , large starspots are necessary to explain their large amount of energy .",
    "many of the superflare stars show quasi - periodic brightness variations with a typical period of from one day to a few tens of days .",
    "the amplitude of these brightness variations is in the range of 0.1 - 10% @xcite , and is much larger than that of the solar brightness variation ( 0.01 - 0.1% ; e.g. , @xcite ) caused by the existence of sunspots on the rotating solar surface .",
    "many ordinary solar - type stars observed by kepler also show such brightness variations and these variations are thought to be caused by the rotation of a star having starspots ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the above brightness variations of superflare stars can be well explained by the rotation of a star with fairly large starspots , taking into account the effects of inclination angle and the spot latitude .",
    "in other words , the existence of large starspots is also supported by the brightness variations .",
    "+   +  @xcite compared the superflare energy and frequency with the rotation period , assuming that the brightness variation period corresponds to the rotation period .",
    "they then found slowly rotating stars can still produce as energetic flares as those of more rapidly rotating stars although the average flare frequency is lower for more slowly rotating stars .",
    "@xcite also clarified that the superflare energy is related to the total coverage of the starspots , and that the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy stored around these large starspots .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested , on the basis of theoretical estimates , that the sun can generate large magnetic flux sufficient for causing superflares with an energy of @xmath17 erg within one solar cycle ( @xmath911yr ) .",
    "+   +  the results described above are , however , only based on kepler monochromatic photometric data . we need to spectroscopically investigate whether these brightness variations are explained by the rotation , and whether superflare stars have large starspots . the stellar parameters and the binarity of the superflare stars are also needed to be investigated with spectroscopic observations in order to discuss whether the sun can really generate superflares .",

    "we have already reported some results of our spectroscopic observations of three superflare stars in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that spectroscopic properties ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , [ fe / h ] , and rotational velocity ) of the two superflare stars kic9766237 and kic9944137 are very close to those of the sun . in (;",

    "we confirmed that the estimated temperature and @xmath19 values of these 34 superflare stars are roughly in the range of solar - type ( g - type main sequence stars ) stars .",
    "in particular , the temperature , surface gravity , and the brightness variation period ( @xmath24 ) of 9 stars including two stars ( kic9766237 and kic9944137 ) reported in @xcite are in the range of  sun - like \" stars ( @xmath15k , @xmath254.0 , and @xmath2610 days ) .",

    "these results suggest that stars whose spectroscopic properties similar to the sun can have superflares , and this supports the hypothesis that the sun might cause a superflare . +   +  on the basis of the above stellar parameters derived in paper i , in this paper we investigate whether the brightness variation is explained by the rotation , and whether superflare stars have large starspots . in this process",

    "this value is consistent with the values of solar mean magnetic field ( a few gauss ) within its error range , though the error range is large .",
    "as mentioned above , we reported the values of projected rotational velocity ( @xmath0 ) , stellar radius ( @xmath38 ) , and the brightness variation period ( @xmath24 ) of the 34  single \" target superflare stars in paper i. the values of @xmath0 and @xmath24 are listed again in table [ tab : r0caha ] .",

    "this is also supported by another fact that the distribution of the data points in figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] are not random .",
    "their distribution is expected to be much more random if the brightness variations have no relations with the stellar rotation .",
    "second , stars that are distributed in the lower right side of figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] are expected to have small inclination angles and to be nearly pole - on stars . in this figure , we distinguish such five stars with especially small inclination angle ( @xmath51 ) ( kic3626094 , kic4742436 , kic6503434 , kic6934317 , and kic9412514 ) from the other stars , using filled triangle data points .",

    "the spot coverage of superflare stars are calculated from the amplitude of stellar brightness variations , and the energy of superflares are estimated by using the superflare amplitude and the duration time @xcite .",

    "the thick and thin dashed lines correspond to the same relation in case of @xmath53 ( nearly pole - on ) for @xmath52=3,000 g and 1,000 g , assuming that the brightness variation becomes small as a result of the inclination effect .",
    "these lines are considered to give an upper limit of superflare energy for each inclination angle @xcite .",
    "considering these things , the superflare stars located in the upper left side of this figure are expected to have a low inclination angle .",
    "open triangles in figure [ fig : spotene ] correspond to superflare stars whose inclination angle is especially small ( @xmath54 ) on the basis of figure [ fig : vlc - vsini ] , while open circles represent the other stars ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "this index is an indicator of chromspheric activity as described in the above sections , but it also depends on @xmath0 ( e.g. , figure 5(a ) of @xcite ) .",
    "a large value of @xmath0 can indeed increase the residual flux , mimicking the effect of filling the line core with chromospheric emission . because of this , we here roughly estimated the emission flux of the ca ii 8542 and h@xmath1 lines in order to remove this influence of @xmath0 .",
    "the ways of estimation is basically the same as done in @xcite , and we summarize the method in the following .",

    ", we can subtract the underlying photospheric contribution from the spectrum of the star , and can investigate the spectral emission originating from the chromosphere in detail @xcite .",
    "we used the spectrum of 61vir obtained in this observation as an inactive template to be subtracted from the spectrum of the target stars .",
    "this is because 61vir is a slowly rotating and non - active early g - type main sequence star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this is because the exposure time for such stars was not sufficient and the resultant s / n ratio around ca ii triplet lines is low .",
