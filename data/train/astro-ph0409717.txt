    "bright examples are the cases of grb 990123 ( z=1.600 ) , for which the reverse shock reached r=9 - 10 mag 1 minute after the grb and the optical afterglow reached r=14 mag 12 minutes after the grb ( e.g. akerlof et al . 1999 , galama et al .",

    "@xmath45 fine structure lines have been detected in two other grbs : grb 020813 ( savaglio & fall 2004 ) and grb 030323 ( vreeswijk et al . 2004 ) .",
    "their ratio can be used to constrain the gas density or the radiation field ( if both lines are detected one may solve for both variables , as shown by srianand & petitjean 2000 ) , so their detection in grb spectra looks very promising to constrain the physical properties of the absorbing gas .    for this system",
    "the line is strongly saturated and so it can not be used together with the to constrain the gas ionization status . as discussed in the previous section , within rather large uncertainties , the [ / ] would suggest for n=1 @xmath49 a ionization parameter somewhat higher than that indicated by all other line ratios , assuming meteoritic abundances .",
    "this may be explained by a slight under - abundance of c with respect to si in this system .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to system z=2.321 , see below .",
    "the @xmath64 lines of the z=2.328 a , b and c systems are blended with the @xmath65 of the z=2.321 system , suggesting the presence of line locking , as first reported by savaglio et al .",

    "this is higher than the values for the other systems at a confidence level better than 90% .",
    "the [ / ] ratio is formally inconsistent with this higher ionization parameter , but the disagreement is marginal , taking into account that the / curves in figures [ ion2 ] and [ ion2_8 ] are very flat , and therefore small differences in the obsterved / ratio would translate in large differences in the ionization parameter . also in this case the disagreement may be explained by a slight under - abundance of c with respect to si .",
    "given the relatively high velocity shift of about 3000 km / s between the z=2.296 and z=2.298 systems and the host galaxy redshift , there is the possibility , at least in principle , that these systems are not associated with the grb host galaxy but rather are intervening systems .",

    "unfortunately in this case the redshift of the grb is not high enough to have strong high ionization lines in the spectrum , and therefore we do not have a direct way to constrain the ionization status of the gas responsible for the uv absorption .",
    "the [ / ] ratio is consistent with a constant value in the four systems .",
    "this ratio is also consistent with meteoritic abundances , assuming that the ionization parameter is in the range @xmath76 .",
    "the system at z=1.2234 is shifted by about 4200 km / s from the redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "the probability to find an intervening system with @xmath77 ( see table 7 ) within this velocity range is @xmath78 , using the distribution of systems given by steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) .",
    "although not as conclusive as in the case of the z=2.296 and z=2.298 systems in the spectrum of grb 021004 , we remark that this probability is rather small , and that the velocity shift with respect to the redshift of the host galaxy is intriguingly similar to that of the grb 021004 systems .",
    "grb 021004 shows absorption systems which span @xmath79  km / s in velocity towards the observer ( no receding system is detected ) .",
    "the systems are most likely local to the grb since the probability of finding two or more different absorption systems along the line of sight by random fluctuations is negligible .",
    "it has been suggested that radiative acceleration by the prompt grb emission may be responsible for the high detected speeds ( schaefer et al .",
    "however , this seems unlikely since low ionization ions such and are present in the high velocity absorber .",
    "the radiative acceleration is dominated by the grb and early afterglow radiation .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that recombination can be so rapid to have any influence on the acceleration of the absorbing material . in the photoionization phase",
    "each nucleon receives an amount of energy comparable to the ionization potential of the @xmath80shell electron . for a solar metallicity plasma",
    "the acceleration is regulated by h atoms and , at the end of the photoionization , the absorbing material has an outward velocity of : @xmath81 once the gas is fully ionized , acceleration proceeds due to radiation pressure on free electrons through inverse compton ( ic ) interactions . for a burst of isotropic equivalent energy",
    "@xmath82 the ic acceleration is obtained by momentum conservation : @xmath83 we conclude that at the minimum distance of the absorbing medium @xmath84  cm ( lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ; heyl & perna 2003 ; in order to be ahead of the fireball at the time at which absorption is detected ) radiative acceleration is unable to propel the absorber to an outflowing speed comparable to the value(s ) observed .",
    "possible explanations for the large outflowing speed are either a supernova exploded several years prior to the grb ( vietri & stella 1998 ) or a high velocity wind from the progenitor wolf  rayet ( wr ) star ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; schaefer et al .",
    "2003 ; mirabal et al .",
    "the large velocity spread with similar ionization parameter is however difficult to account for in a snr scenario , where values around a typical expansion velocity would be expected . on the other hand ,",
    "wr winds are known to be clumpy and velocities up to @xmath85  km / s were detected from p ",
    "cygni profiles ( niedzlieski & skrzyski 2002 ) .    in this work we derived physical parameters of the absorbers under the assumption of equilibrium conditions which , @xmath86  days after the grb explosion , are attained only if the electron density in the absorber is @xmath87  @xmath49 .",
    "assuming equilibrium conditions , the total column density of the absorber can be computed from the ion column density corrected for the ionization fraction .",
    "consider the line in the a system .",
    "the density is given by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the fireball radius at the time the lines were observed , @xmath90 is the si abundance and @xmath91 is the ratio of the width of the absorbing shell over its radius .",
    "the ionization parameters derived above and implications discussed here are therefore relevant only in the case of an extremely clumpy wind or snr .",
    "the photoionization results of cloudy yield an ionization parameter constrained in a relatively small range @xmath59 . in a single explosion grb model",
    ", the ionization parameter scales with the square of the outflow velocity , since the absorber s distance scales with velocity as well .",
    "even though the ionization parameter depends on the electron density , it seems unlikely that density variations are such as to compensate for the large velocity difference . in a wind environment , on the other hand , the ionization parameter is constant since the photon density and particle density scale with the same power of the distance .",
    "the relatively small variations in the inferred @xmath92 , which do not show any clear trend with velocity , can therefore be interpreted as density fluctuations on top of a regular @xmath0 wind density profile ( as already discussed by e.g. schaefer et al .",
    "2003 and mirabal et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the and column densities found in grb 020813 are 10100 times higher than those in grb 021004 .",
    "this is likely due to a much higher ionization of the gas in the latter case , rather than a large difference in the total absorbing column of gas or to highly non solar metal abundances ( note that in both cases the [ / ] ratio is consistent with meteoritic abundances ) .",
    "we also note the similarity between the velocity shift between the z=1.2234 system and the grb 020813 host galaxy and the shift of the z=2.296 and z=2.298 systems with respect to the grb 021004 host galaxy .",
    "although the probability for a chance occurrence of the z=1.2234 system is not as low as in the cases of the two shifted systems in grb 021004 , and that the z=1.2234 ionization status is probably much lower than that of the z=2.296 and z=2.298 systems , this similarity might suggest a common scenario for the two grbs .",
    "one of the straightforward results of our uves high resolution observations of two grb afterglows is that the ism of the host galaxies is complex , and many components contribute to each main absorption systems .",
    "these components span a total velocity range of up to about 3000 km / s .",
    "several narrow components are resolved down to a width of a few tens of km / s .",
    "the uves wide band coverage allowed us to investigate simultaneously both high ionization lines such as and , and low ionization lines such as and in grb 021004 .",
    "this allowed us to constrain the ionization parameter of the gas of the differerent absorption systems .",
    "combined with photoionization results obtained with cloudy the ionization parameters appear to lie in a relatively small range , with no clear trend with the system velocity .",
    "this can be interpreted as density fluctuations on top of a regular @xmath0 wind density profile .",
    "the [ / ] ratio of @xmath61 found for systems z=2.328_a , z=2.328_b , and z=2.298 is consistent with what is expected from meteoritic abundances . assuming these abundances , the measured column density for system z=2.328_a implies a lower limit of @xmath62 @xmath22 to the system total hydrogen column density .",
    "indeed , our study shows that rapid reaction to the grb triggers , high resolution and wide spectral coverage are the key ingredients to study grb host galaxies .",
    "today observations of this kind are still difficult and rather episodic",
    ". however , they should become routine after the launch of the _ swift _ satellite , also thanks to the development of a dedicated rapid response observing mode for the vlt telescopes .",
    "this mode will make possible automatic follow  up of grbs ( or other transient events ) with response times in the 10m1hr range , therefore helping in gathering spectra of unprecedented quality of medium to high redshift grb host galaxies .",
