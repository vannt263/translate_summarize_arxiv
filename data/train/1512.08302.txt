    "blazars are the most extreme subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , whose jets point in the direction of the observer , and they are characterized by large amplitude and rapid variability at all wavelengths , high and variable polarization , superluminal jet speeds and compact radio emission ( angel & stockman 1980 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "blazars are often divided into two subclasses of bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "fsrqs have strong emission lines , while bl lac objects have only very weak or non - existent emission lines . the classic division between fsrqs and bl lacs is mainly based on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the emission lines . objects with rest frame ew@xmath4  are classified as fsrqs ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ; scarpa & falomo 1997 ) . the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars are usually bimodal .",

    "blazars show variability on different timescales from years down to minutes ( e.g. poon et al .",
    "blazar variability can be broadly divided into intraday variability ( idv ) or micro - variability , short - term variability ( stv ) and long - term variability ( ltv ) .",
    "brightness changes of a few tenth of a magnitude in a time scale of tens of minutes to a few hours is often known as idv ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",

    "variability can shed light on the location , size , structure and dynamics of the emitting regions and radiation mechanism ( ciprini et al .",

    "the presence of a strong host galaxy component can affect measured aperture photometry at least in two way : ( i ) the host galaxy adds flux to the measurement aperture ; ( ii ) in some cases the host galaxy contribution can exceed the nuclear flux by a large margin ( nilsson et al .",
    "2007 ) . the results of nilsson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also show a prominent host galaxy component for mrk 501 .",
    "so mrk 501 need a correction for the host galaxy contribution in the optical band .",
    "however , from previous studying about the optical flux and spectral variability of mrk 501 , we can find that most of authors neglected the host galaxy contributions .",
    "mrk 501 is a very important source for studying gev / tev emission .",
    "the sed of mrk 501 has two bumps occurring at kev and gev / tev energies .",
    "generally , the first bumps is caused by synchrotron radiation from the electron , but the origin of the gev / tev hump is unclear .",
    "although mrk 501 has been observed over the last two decades in the entire electromagnetic spectrum , the existing multi - wavelength data could not provide an explicit answer for the physical mechanisms that are responsible for the production of the gev / tev hump ( e.g. shukla et al .",
    "the sed and the multi - wavelength correlations of mrk 501 have been intensively studied in the past , but the nature of this object is still far from being understood .",
    "the main reason is lack of simultaneous multi - wavelength data during long periods of time ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) . since the launch of the fermi satellite , we have entered in a new era of blazars research ( abdo et al .",
    "the fermi lat with the higher sensitivity and larger energy range has become a crucial tool for studying mrk 501 .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that blazars can vary their emitted power by one or two orders of magnitude on short timescales , and that they emit radiation over the entire observable electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "therefore the information from fermi - lat alone is not enough to understand the broadband emission of mrk 501 , and simultaneous data in other frequency ranges are required",
    ". then long - term optical studies are also so helpful for understanding the nature of mrk 501 .    in view of these facts",
