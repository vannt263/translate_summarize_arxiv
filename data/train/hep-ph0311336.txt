    "supersymmetric gauge theories come with gauge invariant polynomials along which the scalar potential vanishes at a classical level @xcite .",
    "these correspond to the flat directions in the moduli space of the scalar fields . within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "the classical potential is given by the sum of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 term contributions , which vanish individually along these flat directions .",
    "flatness is however lifted by soft supersymmetry breaking , but a non - renormalization theorem guarantees that the flat direction does not obtain any renormalizable perturbative superpotential correction @xcite .",
    "however , non - perturbative ( supergravity - induced ) corrections will also lift the flatness .",
    "mssm flat directions can give rise to a host of cosmologically interesting dynamics ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "these include affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite , the cosmological formation and fragmentation of the mssm flat direction condensate and subsequent @xmath3-ball formation @xcite , reheating the universe with @xmath3-ball evaporation  @xcite , generation of baryon isocurvature density perturbations @xcite , as well as curvaton scenarios where mssm flat directions reheat the universe and generate adiabatic density perturbations @xcite .",
    "adiabatic density perturbations induced by fluctuating inflaton - mssm flat direction coupling has also been discussed  @xcite .    in the mssm",
    "all the flat directions have been parameterized by gauge invariant monomials @xcite .",
    "in such a case the mssm flat direction is some linear combination of the mssm scalars and can be thought of as a trajectory in the moduli space described by a single scalar degree of freedom .",
    "a simple example is the @xmath0 flat direction @xmath4 , defined as @xmath5 ( indices here label su(2 ) ) .",
    "however , a flat direction can also be constructed as a gauge invariant polynomial , where the previously mentioned monomials generate the polynomial .",
    "this means that the flat direction is a non - linear combination of the mssm fields .",
    "it no longer can be described by a single scalar field .",
    "such a gauge invariant polynomial , rather than a monomial , is needed e.g. when for @xmath0 instead of a single leptonic generation one considers simultaneously all three .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to illustrate the dynamics of affleck - dine condensate described by a gauge invariant polynomial .",
    "previously senami and yamamoto @xcite have considered such a case in mssm and its extensions but they used an extrinsic point of view without gauge invariant polynomials .",
    "we will discuss the dynamics from an intrinsic point of view _",
    "i.e. _ using coordinates that describe only the behaviour of the flat direction .",
    "given that the flat direction is the minimum of energy the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "we will also discuss how a non - renormalizable superpotential correction can lift such a multi - field flat direction .",
    "we will highlight the formation and charge conservation of the condensate along with the gauge conditions required to be satisfied . in the present paper",
    "we will mostly restrict ourselves to a simple example of a flat direction involving @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( `` the @xmath8 flat direction '' ) , which is a linear combination of superfields , and study its dynamical evolution through the cosmic history of the universe .",
    "we begin our discussion with the basic definitions of the flat directions in @xmath9 supersymmetry in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we first construct @xmath8 flat direction parameterized by a gauge invariant monomial .",
    "we then discuss gauge invariant polynomials which are @xmath1 and @xmath2 flat at the level of unbroken supersymmetry and write down the equation of motion for the @xmath8 scalars with the help of two projection operators , defined in the appendix . vanishing of the gauge currents is carefully accounted for . to in section 4",
    "we write down the multifield scalar potential , accounting for supersymmetry breaking and non - renormalizable superpotential corrections . in section 5",
    "we discuss qualitatively the dynamical behavior of the @xmath8 condensate consisting , comparing it with single field case .",
    "section 6 presents the results numerical studies for the multifield trajectories , charge densities and charge asymmetries . in section 7",
    "we make concluding remarks and discuss the physical implications of the results .",
    "the scalar potential of supersymmetric theories is given by @xcite v = _ a d^a d^a + _ i ||^2 , where @xmath10 is the superpotential and the d - flat directions are solutions to d^a = _ i _",
    "t^a _ i = 0 , where @xmath11 are the scalar fields and @xmath12 are the generators of the symmetry group , which for @xmath13can be chosen to be hermitian and traceless . making a gauge transformation _",
    "i u(x)_i transforms the d - term in to d^a _ i _",
    "i^ u(x)^-1t^a u(x ) _ i = _ i _",
    "^a _ i , where @xmath14 is also hermitian and traceless .",
    "since @xmath12 are basis for traceless hermitian matrices , then @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 with @xmath16 as complex coefficients .",
    "hence the d - term , reads d^a",
    "c^ab d^b = 0 , where was used in the last step , proving that is gauge invariant . the solutions , , are gauge orbits .",
    "( this can be generalized to other gauge groups by virtue of baker - campbell - hausdorff formula or in general quoting that d term transforms as a vector in the adjoint representation , which essentially have been shown to be the case for @xmath17 ) .",
    "one should also specify the gauge field configuration related to the scalar field because it is changed by a gauge transformation .",
    "the minimum energy is obtained with pure gauge configurations @xmath18 .",
    "the equation of motion for the gauge field is d^ f_^a = j_^a , where @xmath19 is the matter current defined by j_^a = i_i ( ( d__i)^ t^a _ i - _ i^ t^a ( d _ _ i ) ) . with a pure gauge configuration the left hand side of vanishes , providing a constraint on the matter current  , and a relationship between the flat direction and gauge fields . choosing a gauge corresponds to picking a scalar field value and the gauge field value from the gauge orbit .    minimizing the energy of the configurations , the equation of motion ,",
    "requires that @xmath20 .",
    "this of course results into vanishing current in . with the gauge choice , @xmath21 , the scalar fields",
    "would then have to be constants .",
    "however , once susy breaking is included , the scalar fields become dynamical and the condition on the minimum energy becomes more subtle . for a homogeneous scalar field one can check that the minimum of energy is still obtained by a pure gauge configuration , despite the fact that the scalar fields have a non - vanishing energy . therefore the current   has to vanish , but now @xmath22 .",
    "this is a constraint on the cosmological dynamics of mssm condensates that has to be satisfied .",
    "let us remark that for inhomogeneous fields the situation is even more complicated .",
    "the minimum of energy still obeys the equation of motion , but it is no longer obvious that the minimum is obtained with a pure gauge configuration and a zero current .",
    "in fact , a more likely situation is that a spatially varying condensate , implying a spatially varying gauge charge , will give rise to non - vanishing currents and non - trivial gauge configurations . in the present paper",
    "we do not consider inhomogeneous condensates , but if one were to study the spatial fluctuations of the flat direction inhomogeneities would have to be taken into account .",
    "the solutions of   can be parameterized by analytic gauge invariant polynomials @xmath23  @xcite which can be obtained by solving = c_i^ * , where @xmath24 is a complex coefficient . , by demanding @xmath25 .",
    "] this equation is also gauge invariant and therefore acts as a solution to a gauge orbit .",
    "the geometrical significance of   is that the polynomial @xmath26 defines level surfaces , e.g. @xmath27 , which actually are the gauge orbits of the complexified gauge group .",
    "then the flat direction corresponds to the minimum of the norm , @xmath28 , which turns out to be orthogonal to @xmath4 . for analytic functions",
    "the complex conjugate of the gradient is orthogonal to the level surface .",
    "this leads to   which just states that the gradient of @xmath26 and the complex conjugate of @xmath4 have to be parallel ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "if the polynomial describing the flat direction is actually a monomial and is composed of @xmath29 scalar fields of the model , then from   it follows that there are @xmath29 complex equations for @xmath30 complex variables , @xmath11 , and @xmath24",
    ". therefore there is at least one complex degree of freedom left , which can be chosen to be the scalar field parameterizing the flat direction . in case of flat directions parameterized by multiple scalar fields ,",
    "the relevant polynomial is a sum of monomials @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are complex coefficients   can be chosen freely , by a reparameterization of @xmath24 in  . ] . as a consequence ,",
    "there appear extra complex degrees of freedom .",
    "a generic treatment of polynomials generating mssm flat directions is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "rather , in order to gain some insight on the dynamics of flat directions with multiple fields , we focus on a simple example , the @xmath0 flat direction .",
    "let us begin by reiterating the case for a single generation of leptons , denoted here as @xmath6 .",
    "the relevant monomial is then given by  @xcite i = h_ul = _ h_u^",
    "l^. applying the constraint  , one obtains two equations & = & _ l^ = c ( h_u^)^ * , & = & _ h_u^ = c ( l^)^*. by taking the absolute values of the equations , it follows that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by multiplying the first equation by @xmath36 and summing over @xmath37 , one obtains that @xmath38 .",
    "hence the general structure of @xmath0 is given by h_u = ( + ) , l = e^i ( -^ * + ^ * ) , where @xmath39 are complex scalar fields and @xmath40 is a real scalar field .",
    "let us now apply the current constraint @xmath41 as given by . in the case of single leptonic generation we can write it as j_^a = i((d_h_u)^ t^a h_u - h_u^ t^a d_h_u + ( d_l)^ t^a l - l^ t^a d_l ) = 0 , where @xmath12 are the @xmath42-generators so that there are four equations altogether . since the current is gauge invariant",
    ", we can choose a gauge , and since the gauge is pure , we may choose @xmath21 .",
    "( the details of the calculation is left to the next subsection , see  ) .",
    "as is well known , the final result turns out to be h_u = ( + 0 ) , l = ( 0 + ) , where @xmath4 is a complex scalar field .",
    "one has to check that   is also f - flat .",
    "the f - terms are obtained from the superpotential w = _ u q h_u |u + _ d q h_d",
    "|d + _ e l h_d |e + _ h h_u h_d , where @xmath43 are the yukawa couplings , family , colour and @xmath44 indices are suppressed . one can easily find that the @xmath0 is automatically f - flat except for the @xmath45-term in the last equation .",
    "however , since @xmath45 is of the order of the susy breaking mass , and , since susy breaking terms anyway lift the flat direction , the @xmath45-terms can be neglected at this stage .",
    "the lagrangian along the @xmath0 direction reads simply as = |_h_u|^2 +      in principle , the discussion above applies separately for each lepton generation .",
    "however , apart from pure chance , there is no physical mechanism that would pick out one generation over the others . hence a most natural possibility would be to consider @xmath0 parametrized by all three leptonic degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore we should consider the gauge invariant polynomial i = _ 1 h_u l_1 + _ 2 h_u l_2 + _ 3 h_u l_3 , where @xmath46 are complex coefficients ( of which one can be freely chosen ) .",
    "the d - flatness equations   become ( compare with ) & = & _ i=1 ^ 3 _ i _ l_i^ = c(h_u^)^ * , & = & _ i _",
    "h_u^ = c(l_i^)^*. by solving @xmath47 from the second equation and inserting into the first , one obtains the constraint |c|^2 = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3    @xmath48 from the first equation and inserting into the second , one obtains a matrix equation p ( ^)^ * = ( ^)^ * , p_ij = , where @xmath49 is a vector in flavor space and @xmath50 is a projection matrix to the vector @xmath51 .",
    "note that   can be fulfilled only if @xmath52 is parallel to @xmath53 so that ( ^)^ * = c^ , where @xmath54 is a complex coefficient .",
    "the flat direction is given by l_i = _ i^ * ( c^1 * + c^2 * ) , h_u = e^i_c ( c^2 + -c^1 ) , where @xmath55 is the phase of @xmath24 which was left undetermined in .",
    "making redefinitions @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is real field and @xmath60 is the phase of @xmath61 , one obtains a simplified expression for the field content of the @xmath0-flat direction l_i = _ i ( + 1 ) , h_u = e^i ( 1 + -^ * ) .",
    "let us now apply the current constraint @xmath41  , where j_^a = i((d_h_u)^ t^a h_u - h_u^ t^a d _",
    "h_u ) + i_i ( ( d_l_i)^ t^a l_i - l_i^ t^a d _",
    "we find j_^y & = & = 0 , + j_^3 & = & = 0 , [ curr318 ] + j_^1+i2 & = & i=0 , [ curr319 ] where j_i^_i^ * _ _ i - _ i _ _ i^ * ,  j^^ * _ - _ ^*. adding eqs .",
    "( [ curr317 ] ,  [ curr318 ] ) together , we obtain _ = . using eqs .",
    "( [ constr320 ] ,  [ curr319 ] ) , one obtains @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 therefore we may gauge it away by a global @xmath64 transformation including it in the normalization of @xmath11 .",
    "hence we finally obtain l_i = _ i ( 0 + 1 ) , h_u = e^i ( 1 + 0 ) , where @xmath59 is given in  .",
    "since the final configuration is three complex dimensional which is the maximal dimension of the flat direction @xcite containing @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the polynomial gives a complete characterization of the @xmath0 flat direction .",
    "for one scalar field the constraint for the phase @xmath59 in reduces to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the phase of the scalar field @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , up to a normalization , the field configuration reduces to .",
    "however , for more than one scalar field , the constraint is not necessarily solvable .",
    "the problem is the following : on the right hand side there is a vector field ( formed as a sum of the scalar fields @xmath11 and their derivatives ) , on the left hand side there is a gradient of the scalar function , so the right hand side has to be rotationless ( in the language of differential forms the one - form on the right - hand side has to be closed for it to be exact ) .",
    "the necessary ( and in simply connected space sufficient ) condition for the vector field to be a gradient of a scalar function is ( _",
    "_ - _ _ ) = 0 , which yields _ ^ ( 1-p_1-p_2 ) _ = 0 , where the @xmath70 are projection operators discussed in the appendix",
    ".    from one sees that the components of the gradient are constrained to be orthogonal outside of the two - dimensional surface spanned by @xmath71 and @xmath72 . on the surface",
    "there are no constraints .",
    "if there is only one scalar field , then @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two - dimensional and is trivially satisfied , since in this case @xmath73 . if the scalar fields do not depend on space or time , then the constraint is trivially satisfied .",
    "if the fields depend only on one coordinate ( time or one of the spatial coordinates ; homogeneous fields fall into this category ) , then again one can show that the constraint is trivially satisfied .",
    "since in the cosmological context the large scale homogeneity is a reasonable approximation , we do not have to worry here about not fulfilling .",

    "usually we take @xmath87 .",
    "there are also hubble induced a - terms if the inflation is induced by the f - term ahw + h.c . , where @xmath88 is a complex coefficient , for d - term inflation @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "during inflation @xmath90 and the minima of the potential are fixed points of the equation of motion for the homogeneous mode as in @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath91 is a fixed point so that eventually only the potential term in remains in the equation of motion .",
    "local stability is due to the fact that the last three terms of do not contribute to linearized perturbations .",
    "after inflation the universe is dominated by the inflaton oscillations , which produces effectively a matter dominated universe with @xmath92 .",
    "before the oscillations start , @xmath93 , we can make the approximation @xcite that only the hubble induced mass term and the non - renormalizable terms are important .",
    "( the hubble induced a - term affects only the phase ) .",
    "then we can find a fixed point solution following @xcite and making the change of variables _ i = ( mh)^1/2_i , t = m_s^-1e^z . at the fixed point , @xmath94 , so that the equation of motion simplifies to m^2(1 - p_1 + p_2 ) - ( + ) = 0 , where @xmath95 is the potential in with @xmath96 as independent variables instead of @xmath11 , and @xmath24 is a matrix with @xmath97 .",
    "an effective potential can be obtained for , whose extrema are fixed points of the equation of motion .",
    "this is a tedious calculation in general but with @xmath98 for all @xmath99 one finds v_eff = m^2 v_nr ( ) - 2 ( + ) ^. hence the effective potential is bounded from below provided @xmath95 is .",
    "the minima of @xmath100 correspond to marginal fixed points of the equation of motion .",
    "this reasoning is similar to the one field case @xcite , where there is no friction term for @xmath101 flat directions .",
    "however , one can not solve in a closed form , but solution(s ) definitely exist since @xmath95 is positive definite and higher order than the second term .",
    "when all the terms in the potential are taken into account , this is only an approximate behavior .      at @xmath102",
    "the scalar fields @xmath11 feel the torque produced by the a terms and start to rotate .",
    "the precise onset of rotation depends on @xmath78 and @xmath33 because the phase rotation of @xmath11 starts when @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath104 the lepton charge densities in the co - moving volume of @xmath11 asymptote to ( different ) constant values .",
    "the scalar fields at this time decay as @xmath105 for a matter dominated universe .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one - field case @xcite .",
    "however , for quantitative results one has to resort to numerics .",
    "since we expect a fixed point behavior , for numerical calculations it is useful to choose the variables as defined in . in the one - field case",
    "it is easy to obtain the initial conditions for the evolution after inflation by solving for the field value at the minimum .",
    "here this is not possible .",
    "instead we assign random initial values and solve the equations of motion during inflation numerically for 50 e - foldings and then insert the values thus obtained into the equations of motion valid after inflation . in practice",
    "the duration of inflation is inessential as the fields tend to relax into the minima in 10 - 20 e - folds .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have restricted our considerations to the case where the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath106 is diagonal .",
    "we then find inumerical solutions which are stable . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] we have plotted the trajectories of the scalar fields @xmath11 in the complex plane . in contrast with the one field case @xcite , the scalar fields do not relax directly into the origin when @xmath104 .",
    "this is also implicit in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where there is a non - zero charge for the slepton fields right from the beginning .",
    "this feature can be ascribed to a phase oscillation around the minimum of the potential .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have plotted the evolution of the lepton charge densities in the co - moving volume of the slepton fields @xmath66 as parameterized in . note that the total lepton charge is in units of @xmath107 , where @xmath108 .",
    "the initial conditions were again chosen by first solving the equations of motion during inflation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have plotted the dependence of charge density against the phase @xmath109 of hubble - induced a - term coefficient @xmath110 with two different initial conditions during inflation . the different initial conditions definitely affect the charge densities of the individual slepton fields .",
    "however , although the initial conditions also affect the total charge density , the effect is not as large as for the individual charges . if one where to choose all the initial field values equal so that all the charge densities would be equal , the total charge density evolution would differ from those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in magnitude but not in overall shape .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the charge asymmetry @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "one sees that for all these cases one produces a charge asymmetry of roughly @xmath114 .",
    "the numerical studies indicate the produced baryon - to - entropy ratio is not significantly changed when including all the lepton families to the @xmath0 flat direction .",
    "it thus seems that the simple one - field case captures the essential features of the affleck - dine mechanism , at least for @xmath0 .    however , there are some interesting details that do change .",
    "the first is that the flat direction has non - minimal kinetic terms , which is due to the fact that the sub - manifold spanned by the flat direction is curved . in the one - field case",
    "non - minimality is absent because all the one - dimensional manifolds are flat .",
    "hence there is always a choice of coordinates where the field metric is given by just the kronecker delta .",
    "another difference is that there is phase motion of the fields already right after inflation .",
    "this is due to the f - terms containing cross terms that break individual lepton symmetries .",
    "however , the f - terms conserve the total lepton charge which is produced only through the a - term .",
    "the individual charges may in general have opposite signs and can give substantial contribution to the entropy , which is proportional to the sum of absolute values of the individual charge densities .",
    "the total charge is the sum of individual charge densities and thus cancellations can occur .",
    "although the behaviour of a homogenous @xmath0 background with multiple scalar fields is not qualitatively different from the corresponding one - field case , this may not be true if inhomogeneities are taken into account . for small cosmological perturbations and multiple fields",
    "the gauge current condition of becomes highly non - trivial .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "@xmath0 is described by three complex scalar fields or six real degrees of freedom .",
    "the current condition defines a two - dimensional submanifold in the six - dimensional space , so that there are four real fluctuation degrees of freedom that would not obey .",
    "hence there would exist matter currents .",
    "this implies that the pure gauge field no longer provides a solution for the equations of motion . as a consequence ,",
    "there would arise electric and magnetic gauge fields which could contribute to the cmb perturbations .",
    "these might be of paramount importance for condensate fragmentation , since the fragments ( the ground states of which are q - balls ) result from the non - linearities of the perturbations @xcite .",
    "the q - ball properties @xcite have been considered only for condensates with minimal kinetic terms .    in this paper we focused on the @xmath0 direction .",
    "for other directions more complications may arise .",
    "for example , the @xmath115 flat direction @xmath116 has six different superpotential terms that contribute to the lifting of the flat direction : @xmath101 term @xmath117 , @xmath118 terms @xmath119 and @xmath120 and @xmath115 terms @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath124 terms have @xmath125 whereas the @xmath101 term has @xmath126",
    ". these will give rise to cross terms in the f term which has a non - zero @xmath127 and therefore contributes to the total charge .",
    "such a situation occurs whenever the various superpotential terms with different @xmath127 have at least one field in common .",

    "we thank karsten jedamzik for helpful discussion .",
    "projection of a vector @xmath128 along a vector @xmath129 is given by , where @xmath130 is a ( complex ) scalar product .",
    "the operation of projection corresponds to a matrix p = , where we have marked the vector with a column matrix and @xmath131 represents the hermitian conjugation .",
    "then is just @xmath132 .    in the present paper",
    "the projection operators needed are somewhat complicated since in principle they operate on the real basis of complex vectors .",
