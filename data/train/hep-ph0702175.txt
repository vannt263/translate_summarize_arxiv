    "the standard model ( sm ) is one of the most successful models in physics and it is in very good agreement with almost every measurement in high energy physics@xcite . despite this fact , there are many motivations to believe that the sm is not the last step in the description of the physics of elementary particles .",
    "there are many theoretical motivations to believe that there is physics beyond the standard model , and recently the neutrino oscillation experiments have also given an experimental input on these thoughts . among the most popular extensions of the sm",
    "we find grand unified theories ( gut ) , supersymmetry ( susy ) , and extra dimensions .",
    "none of these theories have been observed in the laboratory , but there are extensive searches for signatures of them in collider physics .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to analyze the potential of low energy neutrino experiments either to confirm the presence of new physics if it would be discovered by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , or put stronger or complementary constraints on their parameters .",
    "we center our attention in signatures that could appear in two different reactions : coherent neutrino - nuclei scattering and neutrino - electron elastic scattering . as concrete examples of coherent neutrino - nuclei scattering",
    "we will consider the texono proposal  @xcite , a stopped pion source ( sps ) with a noble gas detector  @xcite and the recently discussed proposal of low energy beta beams  @xcite .",
    "for the neutrino electron scattering case , we concentrate in the double chooz proposal  @xcite .    for some of these experimental proposals",
    "there have already been discussions about their perspectives for constraining non - standard neutrino interactions  @xcite or a non - zero neutrino magnetic moment  @xcite . in this work",
    "we introduce a new comparative analysis between different low energy experiments , focusing on three different types of new physics phenomenology , namely extra neutral gauge bosons , leptoquarks and @xmath0-parity breaking supersymmetry . as far as we know , this is the first time that the sensitivity of low energy neutrino proposals to leptoquarks is studied . on the other hand ,",
    "extra neutral gauge bosons sensitivity had been studied only for the texono and neutrino electron scattering proposals  @xcite . for the case of @xmath0-parity breaking supersymmetry the existing studies have tested either long - baseline neutrino experiments  @xcite that introduce an extra dependence on @xmath1 , or new physics effects in the source due to charged currents  @xcite , while here we will focus on neutral currents effects , visible in the detector , specifically in a short baseline detector based on coherent neutrino nuclei scattering . moreover",
    ", the study of different future proposals at one time gives to the reader an extra usefulness of telling which future experiments will give better chances in the different types of new physics under study .",
    "we will see that , despite the fact that we are dealing with very low energy experiments there are good chances to obtain a very good sensitivity to these types of new physics and either to compete or to give complementary constraints to those that could be obtained from collider experiments .",
    "the structure of the article is the following : in section ii we describe the experimental proposals that we study . in section iii",
    "we introduce the different types of new physics under consideration and the expected sensitivity in the different experimental setups . finally in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "before introducing the phenomenology to study new physics signatures we would like to discuss the low energy neutrino experimental proposals .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the case of future experiments aiming to measure the coherent neutrino scattering off nuclei as well as the case of low energy neutrino - electron - scattering experiments .",
    "for the first reaction we study three different recent proposals while for neutrino - electron scattering we concentrate in the double chooz case .",
    "texono collaboration has recently started a research program towards the measurement of neutrino - nuclei coherent scattering by using reactor neutrinos and an `` ultralow - energy '' germanium detector ( ulege )  @xcite .",
    "the proposed detector would consist of 1  kg of an ultralow - energy germanium detector with a threshold as low as 100  ev and a background level below 1  kev in the range of 1 count - per - day that implies a signal to noise ratio bigger than 22 .",
    "although an estimate for the systematic uncertainties is not available , we can consider that they will be dominated by the reactor power , its fuel composition , and the anti - neutrino spectrum .",
    "we assume that these uncertainties will give an approximate error of 2%  @xcite .",
    "besides the 100  ev threshold , we will also consider the more conservative case of a 400  ev threshold .",
    "the typical time scale of data taking is assumed to be from one to several years .",
    "the electron anti - neutrino flux is coming from the kuo - sheng nuclear power station .",
    "the detector will be located at a distance of 28  m from the reactor core . in our computation",
    "we will assume a typical reactor neutrino flux of @xmath2  s@xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "there are several parameterizations that consider in detail the neutrino spectrum coming from a reactor  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use the most recent parameterization  @xcite for the neutrino spectrum . since the proposed experiments are not running yet",
    ", we will assume that the relative contribution of the fissile isotopes ( @xmath5u , @xmath6pu , @xmath7u , @xmath8pu ) is given by the typical average values of the reactor operating period  @xcite which is given by @xmath9 .",
    "we have checked numerically that the results does not change significantly with other ratios . for energies below @xmath10  mev",
    "there are only theoretical calculations for the antineutrino spectrum that we take from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since we are not able to account for the detector efficiency and resolution , we will estimate the total number of expected events in a detector as @xmath11 with @xmath12 the data taking time period , @xmath13 the total neutrino flux , @xmath14 the total mass of the detector , @xmath15 the normalized neutrino spectrum , @xmath16 the maximum neutrino energy , @xmath17 the detector energy threshold .",
    "the maximal recoil energy is @xmath18 .",
    "the same expression relates the minimum required incoming neutrino energy with the detector threshold @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , for the detector s threshold 400  ev and @xmath19ge nucleus , the minimum required incoming neutrino energy is about 3.8  mev which is well satisfied for reactor neutrinos .      a different proposal for detecting the coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering considers the use of another source of neutrinos , a sps , such as the spallation neutron source at oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "recently , this type of source was proposed to measure coherent neutrino scattering off nuclei as well as non - standard neutrino properties  @xcite .",
    "the total beam flux consists of the following well - known neutrino fluxes :    * the monoenergetic 29.9  mev @xmath20 s produced from pion decay at rest , @xmath21 ; * @xmath22 and @xmath23 coming from muon decay , @xmath24 , with a time delay about @xmath25s , muon decay time scale .",
    "the neutrino spectra are well known . here",
    "we will consider only the total delayed flux ( @xmath23  @xmath26  @xmath27 ) as was done in ref .",
    "we assume a total flux of @xmath28  s@xmath3  @xmath4 . among different possible detector materials such as ar , ge or xe , we will concentrate on the noble gas detector , @xmath29ne , of typical mass about @xmath30  kg with a data taking time scale from one to several years and a threshold of @xmath31  kev .",
    "the usage of accelerated radioactive nuclei to produce a well known flux of neutrinos  beta beam  was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown soon afterwards that low energy beta beams open new possibilities to study neutrino properties  @xcite and , recently , a neutrino - nuclei coherent scattering experiment using neutrinos from low energy beta beams was discussed  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , tests for @xmath0 parity violating supersymmetry have been discussed both by the direct detection of @xmath32 leptons in a nearby detector  @xcite as well as in long baseline beta - beam experiments  @xcite .",
    "in particular we base our analysis on the beta - beam experiment discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we consider a storage ring of total length @xmath33  m with a straight sections of length @xmath34  m. in the stationary regime the mean number of ions in the storage ring is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the lifetime of the parent nuclei , @xmath37 is the number of injected ions per second and @xmath38 is the time delay factor with @xmath39 the ion velocity in the laboratory frame . as previous authors , we will consider a cylindrical detector of radius @xmath40  cm and depth @xmath41  cm , aligned with one of the storage ring s straight sections , and located at a distance @xmath42  m from it .",
    "integration over the decay path and over the volume of the detector gives the total number of events per unit time @xmath43 where @xmath44  year is the data taking time , @xmath45 is the number of target nuclei per unit volume , @xmath46 is the relevant neutrino - nucleus cross - section . for definiteness",
    "we consider the case of a ton of xe as a target and a factor @xmath47 for @xmath48he ions as described in ref .  @xcite . as for the threshold energy , we consider both the realistic threshold of @xmath49  kev where background events are negligible as well as the very optimistic @xmath50  kev threshold that , according to the same reference , will give a bigger number of events if background could be subtracted , though at present there is no technology capable of dealing with such a background .",

    "the energy of emitted lepton ( electron or positron ) is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the @xmath63 value of the reaction , and the fermi function @xmath64 accounts for the coulomb modification of the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a different type of experiment that we will also consider in this article is based on low energy neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "this process has already been considered as a possible place to search for an extra gauge boson  @xcite .",
    "the case of a reactor source to constrain new physics has recently been discussed both for present  @xcite and future proposals  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will concentrate on the perspectives for the double chooz experiment  @xcite . as in  @xcite",
    ", we assume that the double chooz will collect @xmath65 neutrino - electron - scattering events considering a 3gw reactor and a 26.5 ton detector with an electron visible energy window @xmath66  mev  @xmath67  mev . as in the case of the texono proposal",
    ", we will use the most recent parameterization  @xcite for the neutrino spectrum and the same fuel composition .",
    "we summarize the main characteristics of the detectors in table  [ detectors ] .",
    "one can notice that in some cases it could be possible to run the experiment for a period longer than one year , or to upgrade the detector mass , obtaining a smaller statistical error without being dominated by systematic uncertainties .",
    "this is the case , for example , for a beta beam with a 15 kev threshold .",
    "on the other hand the stopped pion source seems to be suitable only for a one year of data taking .",
    "finally we also consider the very optimistic cases in which experimentalists can reduce the uncertainties in a low threshold regime ( like a beta beam with a 5 kev threshold ) . in this case",
    "we assume that the systematic uncertainties remain the same .    in the next sections we will take into account all these experimental setups .",
    "we will also show results for possible upgrades to these experiments , i.e. , we will consider that the experimental setup can be running for a longer time ( or that an upgrade in mass is possible ) . among the difficulties for the upgrade we must take special care of the systematic error expectations . in order to take a reasonable compromise with future experimental capabilities , we will consider the systematic errors quoted in table  [ detectors ] .",
    "since we are dealing with experiments that are not running yet , we believe that this approach will be helpful to take notice of what would be the expected limits for each experiment .    .expected events for different experimental setups [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in case of an observation at colliders like lhc and lep , one can constrain directly the leptoquark mass . the expected sensitivity for lhc could be as high as 1.6 tev  @xcite . however , for indirect observations , like our low energy 4-fermion case , one can constrain only the combination @xmath68 . an extensive list of constraints on the leptoquark couplings and masses",
    "is given in refs .",
    "@xcite . the current limit for a leptoquark which couples to the first generation of leptons and first generation of quarks",
    "is given by @xmath69    we have calculated the sensitivity to the vector first generation leptoquark couplings and masses which is expected at different low energy neutrino experiments already discussed in this work . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we show the expected sensitivity at 95 % c. l. for each experiment and the possible improvements if the experimental setup could run with a bigger mass or for a longer time .",
    "one can see that the low energy neutrino experiments are very promising for improving the present bounds .",
    "the sensitivities for the case of scalar leptoquark masses for different low energy neutrino experiments are collected in table [ tab3 ] . for easy comparison with the bounds given in",
    "@xcite we have fixed the leptoquark effective coupling at the electroweak value : @xmath70 and we compute the sensitivity of the scalar leptoquark mass at 95 % c.l .",
    "these results also show a big potential for low energy neutrino experiments to give a complementary information about leptoquark masses and couplings .",
    "-parity breaking terms for different experimental setups .",
    "the dependence on the size of the detector and time of running is also shown as well as the current limits .",
    "see the text for a detailed explanation of these couplings ]    in supersymmetric theories , gauge invariance does not imply baryon number ( b ) and lepton number ( l ) conservation and , in general , the so called r - parity ( defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the spin ) is violated",
    ". however , one has to keep the consistency with the non - observation of fast proton decay .",
    "one may consider , for instance , the r - parity violating mssm ( imposing baryon number conservation ) with a superpotential that contains the following @xmath73- violating terms  @xcite : @xmath74 where we use the standard notation , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 to denote the chiral superfields containing the left - handed lepton and quark doublets and the right - handed charged - lepton and @xmath77-quark singlets respectively ; @xmath78 are generation indices . a lepton - higgs term ( @xmath79 )",
    "can also be included in the superpotential , but it can be rotated away through an appropriate redefinition of the superfields .    at low energies , the heavy supersymmetry particles can be integrated out and the net effect of the @xmath0-breaking interactions is to generate effective 4-fermion operators involving the lepton and quark fields .    by considering the case where a single yukawa coupling ( with one flavor structure ) is much larger than the others , the effective four - fermion operator generated by @xmath80 takes the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) with the new couplings  @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 the factors @xmath83 account for the fermi coupling constant redefinition @xmath84 that arise from the modification to the @xmath85 decay due to @xmath0-breaking interaction .",
    "since the value of the fermi constant comes from muon decay experiments , we can not get any information on the charged current susy parameters and we should concentrate only in the neutral current corrections . as already mentioned in a previous section , a different approach has also been considered , that is the direct detection of @xmath32 leptons in a nearby detector  @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ barger ] ) we can see that the @xmath0 breaking terms appear both in the @xmath86 and @xmath87 couplings .",
    "we take into account this correlation and we show in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the possible future sensitivity at 95 % c. l. of the neutrino nucleus coherent experiments to the parameter    @xmath88    as in previous sections , the possible improvements if the experimental setup could run with a bigger mass or for a larger time is shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the current constraints for these parameters are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "stringent constraints exist for specific values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , for instance , from neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite in the particular case @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "we can neglect the @xmath95 parameter and conclude that the perspectives to improve the sensitivity to @xmath96 are quite promising for this type of experiments .",
    "we have shown that low energy neutrino experiments could provide independent and complementary information on @xmath97 , leptoquark masses and couplings and r - parity violating susy interactions .",
    "we have calculated the potential of various future low energy neutrino experiments to either confirm the discovery of extra heavy gauge bosons at lhc or to constrain their masses .    as concrete coherent neutrino - nuclei interaction proposals",
    ", we have discussed the texono case , the stopped pion source with a noble gas detector and the beta beams . in the neutrino - electron - scattering case",
    "we have concentrated on the double chooz experiment .",
    "we have found that a coherent neutrino - nuclei scattering using reactor neutrinos , such as the texono proposal , or a beta - beam neutrino source , could have a high sensitivity to new interactions coming from leptoquarks or @xmath0-parity breaking susy , and we showed that the case of a stopped - pion source experiment could also improve the current @xmath0-parity breaking susy constraints . on the other hand , for this kind of experiments an improved constraint to extra heavy neutral gauge bosons seems to be difficult .",
    "for the particular case of leptoquarks , we have found that all the discussed low energy neutrino experiments have the potential to improve the present bound on leptoquark masses and couplings . in particular , the sensitivity to the vector leptoquark mass is of the order of 800  gev , assuming an electroweak value of the coupling , @xmath98 .",
    "for the case of supersymmetry with broken r - parity , the perspectives to improve the constraint on the @xmath99 and the corresponding mass for the @xmath100 are also very promising for all the experimental setups .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that low energy neutrino experiments have great potential to provide us an indirect information about high energy physics and therefore strongly complement accelerator experiments .",
