    "granular media present a fascinating array of physical problems @xcite and are key to a number of important technologies @xcite .",
    "distribution of stress and statistics of force fluctuations in static granular arrays show puzzling properties @xcite .",
    "for instance , photoelastic visualization experiments @xcite show that stresses in granular media concentrate along `` stress paths '' or `` force chains '' .",
    "these are filamentary configurations of grains which carry disproportionally large amount of the total force and give rise to the phenomenon of jamming @xcite .",
    "the intergranular contact forces determine the bulk properties ( e.g. the load bearing capability ) of granular materials @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite and computer simulations @xcite show that the distribution of forces where forces above the mean decay exponentiallly is a robust property of static granular media . despite recent theoretical attempts @xcite and a vast engineering literature @xcite the transmission of stress and statistical properties of contact force distribution in granular media",
    "are still poorly understood at a fundamental level .",
    "this paper is concerned with a static granular material idealised as an assembly of rigid grains , not in general spherical and with either zero or perfect ( in the sense of infinite ) friction .",
    "whilst practical applications in soil mechanics and powder technology evidently depend on much greater levels of detail considered in the engineering literature , the rigid grain paradigm provides a crucial starting point from which to appreciate the theoretical physics of the problem .",
    "we show below that for minimal coordination number there exists an analysis of stress which is independent of the analysis of strain which would be implied by slight relaxation of the rigid grain assumption . in consequence our results",
    "may also have bearing on many computer simulations of quasi - static interacting particles , such as applied to colloids @xcite or soils @xcite , and suggest that the detail of conservative repulsive force laws used may not always be significant .",
    "consider a static assembly of rigid grains of average coordination number @xmath0 , in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the microscopic version of stress analysis consists of determining all of the intergranular forces , given the geometrical arrangement of grains and their contacts and the applied force and torque loadings on each grain .",
    "the number of unknowns per grain is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 for grains with friction and @xmath4 for grains without , and the required force and torque give @xmath5 constraints .",
    "the minimal coordination number , at which the equations of force balance are directly soluble , is thus given by @xmath6 . without friction this gives @xmath7 in @xmath8 respectively . with friction it gives rather low values @xmath9 respectively .",
    "if we admit that grains have some compliance then the intergranular forces calculated from newton s equationsmust also be consistent with being calculated from the displacements of grains .",
    "this implies @xmath10 constraints on the particle displacements , which at minimal coordination is precisely consistent with determining the center displacement and rotation of each particle .",
    "this situation is analogous to linear elasticity in two dimensions , where stress can be analysed independent of the elastic moduli for an isotropic material ; subsequently the displacement field can be recovered ( using the moduli ) and of course this may be relevant for boundary conditions @xcite . for the granular material , no assumption of linearity or isotropy is involved .",
    "equivalent arguments , without consideration of torques and rotations , go through for frictionless spherical grains .",
    "they exhibit minimal coordination number equal to twice the dimension of space . in this paper",
    "we will elaborate in detail the constraint equations satisfied by the stress tensor supported by simple periodic granular arrays . here",
    "we argue how the key result , of simple linear equations of constraint , can be anticipated on quite general grounds .",
    "we consider a periodic array with @xmath11 grains per unit cell and correspondingly @xmath12 intergranular contacts .",
    "the number of strictly periodic ( @xmath13 ) solutions for the intergranular forces dictates how many linearly independent stress components the powder can support macroscopically .",
    "the general stress field of our periodic array will be decomposable over bloch wave solutions @xmath14 , and within these it is the periodic solutions with wavevector @xmath13 which correspond to macroscopically uniform stress . for a periodic solution",
    "the intergranular forces will be constrained by @xmath15 equations of force balance rather than @xmath16 , because no intergranular force can apply a net force to the whole assembly .",
    "unless there is accidental degeneracy ( see end of this section ) there will be no such mitigation of the number of torque constraints at @xmath17 .",
    "the general result is then that at minimal coordination we have precisely @xmath1 degrees of freedom corresponding to macroscopically uniform stress , to be determined macroscopically by the @xmath1 macroscopic ( continuum ) equations of force balance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the stress tensor .",
    "the number of equations restricting the form of macroscopic stress supported , equivalent to a constitutive equation , is @xmath20 , equivalent to one in @xmath21 and three in @xmath22 .",
    "these equations will be developed explicitly for special cases below .",
    "the anomalous case is , unfortunately , the one case previously considered @xcite : minimal periodic lattices of spherical grains with friction .",
    "these are the honeycomb and diamond lattices in @xmath23 dimensions respectively , which have two grains per unit cell related to each other by a reflection symmetry .",
    "the reflection symmetry means that if the torque on one particle is balanced , then so it must also be on the other . as there is no corresponding reduction in the number of independent inter - particle forces , the number of degrees of freedom for solutions corresponding to macroscopic stress is increased to @xmath24 , corresponding to a full set of symmetric stress tensors . as shown in ref.@xcite",
    ", the constitutive equation then takes differential form and has to be found from leading @xmath25-dependent behaviour . in three dimensions ( and higher )",
    "the existence of intermediate classes of behaviour can be conjectured , where some but not all of the constitutive equations are differential in form .",
    "candidate geometries include simple arrays of ellipsoids , but will not be presented here .",
    "consider a periodic triangular array of smooth grains with the geometry of the contacts and their normals as shown in figure [ slipgrain ] .",
    "contact 1 is at positition @xmath26 relative to the grain center , with surface outward normal @xmath27 subject to a force @xmath28 .",
    "note that periodicity requires what would be contact 4 to have normal @xmath29 , to which end we have labelled it @xmath30 , and similarly for the other opposed pairs of contacts .",
    "balance of force around the grain , subject to external force @xmath31 , requires :    @xmath32    and the ( tensorial ) force moment around the grain is given by :    @xmath33    in terms of @xmath34 , the balance of torque on the grain requires that @xmath34 be symmetric , and the macroscopic stress tensor is given by :    @xmath35    for bloch wave solutions of wavevector @xmath25 we have @xmath36 and similarly for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then to leading order in @xmath39 we obtain :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 _ etc . _",
    "are the lattice vectors , and :    @xmath42    this last equation is just macroscopic force balance , equivalent to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the external force per unit volume .",
    "the expression for @xmath34 together with the constraint that it be symmetric restricts the form of the stress tensor .",
    "it is readily verified that the lattice vectors satisfy a triangle equality @xmath45 , and we can without loss of generality rescale the lengths of the normals to obtain a further triangle of vectors @xmath46 , where @xmath47 _",
    "etc_. then it is not difficult to check that @xmath48 ; the two further identities that this appears to offer by changing numerical labels are easily shown to be equivalent to it .",
    "thus the constitutive equation restricting the stress tensor can be written explicitly as :    @xmath49    governed by an order parameter @xmath50 given by :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is a rotation through @xmath53 .",
    "it is interesting that the order parameter @xmath50 is intrinsically chiral , with its sign sensitive to how we index contacts round the grain .",
    "if the isotropic part of @xmath50 happens to vanish , then our constitutive equation reduces to fixed principal axes ( fpa ) ansatz @xcite .",
    "however as all the vectors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are in principle independent of each other , there is no reason to expect :    @xmath58    and fpa ansatz remains a special case .",
    "the simplest regular array to consider here is ( affinely distorted ) face - center cubic , duly giving the minimal coordination number of 12 . opposing pairs of contacts",
    "are mutually constrained as in the two dimensional case , and as wavevector @xmath39 approaches zero we find the force moment tensor given by a sum over the six pairs as :    @xmath59    making @xmath34 symmetric determines three of the @xmath60 , so that we are left with just three degrees of freedom for the symmetric stress , as expected .",
    "the connectivity of the lattice ensures that the six lattice vectors span the edges of a tetrahedron , and there is one normal vector corresponding to each edge . although it is not in general possible to scale the normals to fit the edges of a tetrahedron , we can scale them in usefully analogous way . the three lattice vectors meeting at any vertex have , given appropriate ordering conventions , the property that @xmath61 , where the constant @xmath62 is the volume of the tetrahedron",
    ". the six normal vectors can be rescaled as @xmath63 so that any corresponding set of three obeys the analogous result @xmath64 .",
    "given the above conventions it is not difficult to see that if edges 1,2,3,4 form a circuit enclosing triangles 1,2,5 and 3,4,5 then @xmath65 as both sides are equal to @xmath66 with appropriate scale factor . in this way we can obtain six constraint equations of the form :    @xmath67    of which only three are linearly independent of each other .",
    "for frictionless spheres the simplest periodic lattice of minimal coordination number , @xmath68 , is a cubic array , sheared over in the general case . for this arrangement",
    "it is obvious that the system can support only normal stresses along the symmetry axes .",
    "when these are at right angles this corresponds to fixed principle axis behaviour , but not otherwise .",
    "for grains with friction , the simplest periodic arrays require at least two grains per unit cell because of the relativley low minimal coordination number . the honeycomb and diamond lattices ( for two and three dimensions",
    "respectively ) have already been discused in @xcite , but with an assumption of symmetry between the two grains of the unit cell : this is that the intracell grain contact lies at the centroid of the intercell grain contacts .",
    "here we show that if the intracell contact is displaced by a vector @xmath69 , a simple linear rather than differential constitutive equation results . working for simpicity in two dimensions and focussing on @xmath13 solutions , the force moment ( proportional to stress tensor ) of the unit cell",
    "can be written as :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the force across the intercell contacts spanned by lattice vector @xmath72 . from this",
    "we can find the @xmath73 in terms of @xmath34 and hence expressions for the torque applied to each grain in the unit cell .",
    "the sum of these torques vanishes when @xmath34 is symmetric , but the difference between them is given ( at @xmath13 ) by :    @xmath74    resulting in a constitutive equation    @xmath75    in three dimensions the diamond lattice calculation is analogous , with three intercell grain contacts spanning three lattice vectors , and the resulting constitutive equation is :    @xmath76    in both cases , when the grains become equivalent and @xmath77 one must work to higher order in the wavevector @xmath25 , leading to a differential constitutive equation as shown in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown how the geometrical arrangement of grains and their contacts , assumed known , directly restricts the form of stress tensor that the material can support . in principle",
    "one can only apply forces to a sample , and the restrictions found on the stress tensor are no more than that required to solve for the resulting stress distribution .",
    "independent of friction , dimensionality or even whether the particles are spheres , we find a general universality class @xmath78 of mechanical constitutive equation which is simple linear in the stress components .",
    "the coefficients of this are sensitive to the intergranular geometry to a much finer level than simple objects such as the fabric tensor .",
    "two further universality classes have been found .",
    "the first is where by symmetry of the granular array there is no coupling ( of the constitutive equations ) to @xmath79 , equivalent to fpa ansatz behaviour @xcite . the second class , dl , is where by internal symmetry of the granular array some of the constitutive equations become differential@xcite .",
    "all of the above behaviour is summed up by the general form :    @xmath80    the nul space of @xmath81 acting on @xmath19 corresponds to allowed macroscopic stress fields ; when this includes pure isotropic stress we have the special class fpa .",
    "when the nul space is degenerately large , @xmath82 becomes crucial and we have dl behaviour : the only instances of this which we explicitly calculated had @xmath83 , but the existence of mixed cases in three dimensions ( and higher ) is conjectured . in practice detail of intergranular contacts is not known in advance , but should be deduced from the deposition history of the system .",
    "truly history dependent problems are outside the scope of this paper , but for granular systems which have consolidated or sheared under the applied loading , and for pseudo - elastic assemblies which have undergone significant deformation and rearrangement under stress and/or flow , we can consider the approximation that the current stress itself influences the contact geometry . in two dimensions",
    "we then require to make one scalar equation out of the stress tensor alone , and assuming it to be independent of the magnitude of the stress this must reduce to a condition on the ratio of the principal stress components , @xmath84 .",
    "this is of precisely the same form as classical considerations of limiting internal friction :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the coeffficient of shearing friction . in three dimensions we require three equations , which can not be imposed on the only two principle stress ratios available . in this case",
    ", therefore , it appears that we must have inescapably history - dependent behaviour .",
    "there might remain the possibility that the system selects degenerate case configurations for which at least one of the constitutive equations becomes differential in form , but to achieve this appears to place conditions on the sample history or , leading to contradiction , the present stress tensor .",
