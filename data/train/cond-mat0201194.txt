    "femtosecond time - resolved optical spectroscopy is an excellent experimental alternative to conventional spectroscopic methods that probe the low energy electronic structure in strongly correlated electron systems @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that carrier relaxation dynamics are very sensitive to changes in the low energy density of states ( e.g. associated with the formation of a low energy gap or pseudogap ) providing new insights into the low energy electronic structure in these materials . in this report",
    "we present the first studies of carrier relaxation dynamics in heavy fermion ( hf ) systems by means of femtosecond time - resolved optical spectroscopy .",
    "our results show that the carrier relaxation dynamics , below the kondo temperature ( t@xmath0 ) , are extremely sensitive to the low energy density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level to which localized f - moments contribute .",
    "specifically , we have performed measurements of the photoinduced reflectivity @xmath1r / r dynamics as a function of temperature and excitation intensity on the series of hf compounds ybxcu@xmath2 ( x = ag , cd , in ) @xcite in comparison to their non - magnetic counterparts luxcu@xmath2 .",
    "the experiments were performed on freshly polished flux - grown single crystals .",
    "we used a standard pump - probe set - up with a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( 30 fs pulses at 800 nm and 80 mhz repetition rate ) for both pump and probe pulse trains .",
    "the photoinduced ( pi ) change in reflectivity @xmath1r /",
    "r was measured using photodiode and lock - in detection .",
    "the pump laser fluence was kept below 10 @xmath3j / cm2 and the pump / probe intensity ratio was @xmath430 .",
    "the steady - state heating effects were accounted for as described in @xcite yielding an uncertainty in temperature of @xmath53 k.",
    "in fig . 1a we show the pi reflectivity traces as a function of temperature on the hf system ybcdcu@xmath2 ( t@xmath0 @xmath4100k , low temperature sommerfeld coefficient @xmath6 @xmath4200 mj / mol k@xmath7 ) .",
    "the relaxation time is virtually temperature independent above @xmath8140 k and shows a quasi - divergence ( hundred - fold increase ) as t = 0 k is approached",
    ".    similar behavior ( see fig .",
    "1b ) is observed also in ybagcu@xmath2 ( t@xmath0 @xmath9100k , @xmath6 @xmath4200 mj / mol k@xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "importantly , ybagcu@xmath2 is a much better metal than ybcdcu4 revealing that the observed dynamics are not merely due to changes in the carrier concentration .",
    "furthermore , the relaxation time of the non - hf compound luagcu@xmath2 behaves similar to regular metals @xcite , showing a gradual decrease upon cooling .",
    "this , coupled with the data on the hf compounds in fig .",
    "1b , indicates that the upturn in the relaxation time at @xmath4t@xmath0 and the subsequent divergence as t @xmath11 0 k derives from the low energy electronic structure of these hf compounds .",
    "an important and unresolved issue in hf physics @xcite is whether the electronic ground state is a many - body kondo state that forms only below t@xmath0 , or is more simply described in terms of the thermal population of a narrow gap system with the gap arising from hybridization between the conduction electrons and localized _ f _ electrons ( note that the gap is present at all temperatures above and below t@xmath0 in this case ) . as we have shown , the ultrafast dynamics are clearly sensitive to the low energy electronic state and such experiments may provide insight into the true nature of the hf ground state . however ,",
    "a complete analysis ( currently in progress ) requires many - body calculations beyond the scope of this paper . in the following , we present a heuristic model , which provides some physical insight into the low temperature electron dynamics in hf compounds .",
    "the two - temperature model is commonly employed to interpret the ultrafast dynamics in metals @xcite with the sequence of relaxation events after photoexcitation as follows : the photoexcited carriers first rapidly thermalize via electron - electron scattering ( @xmath12100 fs ) , giving rise to a rapid change in reflectivity on a sub - picosecond timescale .",
    "this is followed by energy transfer to the lattice with a characteristic electron - phonon relaxation time @xmath13 on the order of a picosecond @xcite . at low excitation fluences , as used here , the increase in the electronic temperature after photoexcitation is small compared to the lattice temperature , t. in this limit the t - dependence of @xmath13 in the two - temperature model is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the electron - phonon coupling function @xcite . since @xmath16 is constant above the debye temperature @xmath17 , and proportional to t@xmath18 at t @xmath17 , @xmath19 is expected to decrease linearly upon cooling from room temperature , showing a minimum with a subsequent increase going as t@xmath20 at low temperatures .",
    "however , this low - t upturn in @xmath21 is not observed in luagcu@xmath2 ( fig 1b ) - as it was not observed in conventional fermi liquid metals like au and ag @xcite .",
    "the lack of the low - t quasi - divergence in @xmath21 in conventional metals was shown to result due to the fact that @xmath22 and @xmath13 are comparable below @xmath23300 - 600 k @xcite in the experimental configuration of low laser powers . a non - thermal electron model @xcite that takes into account a  finite",
    " @xmath22 can account for a ) the increased room temperature @xmath13 and b ) the low temperature plateau in the observed temperature dependence of @xmath13 in au and ag @xcite as well as in luagcu@xmath2 .",
    "however , in the hf compounds we have studied @xmath6 is , below t@xmath0 , two orders of magnitude larger than in conventional metals .",
    "this is expected to give rise to a hundred - fold increase in @xmath13 in these systems and the two - temperature model ( without considering the initial non - thermal electron distribution ) is expected to be valid .",
    "this would give rise to @xmath24 @xmath25 at low - t as experimentally observed ( fig .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath15 depends only on @xmath17 and a prefactor that can be estimated from the high - t value of @xmath21 @xcite ( at 300k the value of @xmath21 is close to the estimated @xmath13 ) , one can extract the sommerfeld constant via @xmath26 .",
    "we find a remarkable agreement between the low temperature @xmath27 extracted in this way from @xmath28 and the theoretical calculation @xcite for the case of single impurity model with impurity spin 7/2 - fig 1c , giving further support to this analysis .",
    "in conclusion , we have utilized ultrafast optical techniques to study the dynamics of quasiparticles in hf compounds ybxcu@xmath2 .",
    "we have observed a power - law divergence in the relaxation time at low temperatures . the dramatic hundred - fold increase in the relaxation time at low temperatures in ybxcu@xmath2 ( and the lack of this quasi - divergence in the non - hf luxcu@xmath2 analogs ) clearly demonstrates that our measurements probe the heavy fermion ground state ."
