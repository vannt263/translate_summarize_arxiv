    "<S> the  is a massive , nearby , filamentary dark molecular cloud with a low star - formation efficiency threaded by a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to its main axis . it harbors more than a hundred , mostly quiescent , very chemically young starless cores . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud is , therefore , a good laboratory to study the earliest stages of the star - formation process . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to investigate the primordial conditions and the relation among physical , chemical , and magnetic properties in the evolution of low - mass starless cores . </S>",
    "<S> we used the iram 30-m telescope to map the 1.2  mm dust continuum emission of five new starless cores , which are in good agreement with previous visual extinction maps . for the sample of nine cores , which includes the four cores studied in a previous work </S>",
    "<S> , we derived a  to  factor of ( 1.27@xmath00.12)@xmath110@xmath2  mag  @xmath3 and a background visual extinction of @xmath46.7  mag possibly arising from the cloud material . </S>",
    "<S> we derived an average core diameter of @xmath40.08  pc , density of @xmath410@xmath5  , and mass of @xmath41.7  . </S>",
    "<S> several trends seem to exist related to increasing core density : ( _ i _ ) diameter seems to shrink , ( _ ii _ ) mass seems to increase , and ( _ iii _ ) chemistry tends to be richer . </S>",
    "<S> no correlation is found between the direction of the surrounding diffuse medium magnetic field and the projected orientation of the cores , suggesting that large scale magnetic fields seem to play a secondary role in shaping the cores . </S>",
    "<S> we also used the iram 30-m telescope to extend the previous molecular survey at 1 and 3  mm of early- and late - time molecules toward the same five new  starless cores , and analyzed the normalized intensities of the detected molecular transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed the chemical differentiation toward the sample and increased the number of molecular transitions of the `` diffuse '' ( e.g. the `` ubiquitous '' co , c@xmath6h , and cs ) , `` oxo - sulfurated '' ( e.g. so  and ch@xmath7oh ) , and `` deuterated '' ( e.g. n@xmath6h@xmath8 , cn , and hcn ) starless core groups . </S>",
    "<S> the chemically defined core groups seem to be related to different evolutionary stages : `` diffuse '' cores present the cloud chemistry and are the less dense , while `` deuterated '' cores are the densest and present a chemistry typical of evolved dense cores . </S>",
    "<S> `` oxo - sulfurated '' cores might be in a transitional stage exhibiting intermediate properties and a very characteristic chemistry . </S>"
