    "a graph is defined as a set of nodes ( vertices ) and a set of links between nodes ( edges ) @xcite . by graph evolution or growth",
    "we mean subsequent attaching of new nodes with @xmath2 edges to previously existing nodes @xcite .",
    "such growing graphs may reflect some features of real evolving networks , e.g. a network of collaborators , a network of citations of scientific papers , some biological networks ( food chains or sexual relations ) or internet and world - wide - web pages with links between them @xcite .",
    "the distance between nodes is the shortest number of edges which leads from one node to the other .",
    "the node - node distance ( nnd ) distribution depends on how subsequent nodes are attached .",
    "if each node is connected with _ only one _ of preexisting nodes ( @xmath3 ) _ a tree _ appears .",
    "when a new node is attached to several different nodes with @xmath4 edges , the growing structure is called _ a simple graph_. we may choose nodes to which new nodes are attached in preferential way or randomly . in the latter case we deal with _ exponential _ networks .",
    "if the probability of choosing a node is proportional to its degree ( e.g. to the number of its nearest neighbors ) the growing structure is called _ scale - free _ or albert  barabsi networks @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the numerical algorithm for the network growth  basing on _ distance matrix _ evolution  is presented both , for exponential and scale - free networks ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . the nnd distribution and its characteristics are calculated . for the exponential trees",
    "the iterative formulas for @xmath6-th ordinary moments are derived .",
    "a graph with edges of unit length may be fully characterized by its distance matrix @xmath7 , an element @xmath8 of which is equal to the shortest path between nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this matrix representation is also particularly useful when computer simulations for graph evolution are applied .    attaching subsequent node with one edge ( @xmath3 ) to previously existing network of @xmath11 nodes",
    "corresponds to adding a new @xmath12-th row and a new column to @xmath13 large distance matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the distance from newly added @xmath12-th node to all others via selected  labeled as @xmath14  node is larger by one than the distance between @xmath14-th and all others .",
    "thus , new @xmath12-th row / column is a simple copy of @xmath14-th row / column but with all of its elements incremented @xcite : @xmath15    similarly , when new node is attached to the network with two edges ( @xmath16 ) to two different nodes  which are labeled as @xmath14 and @xmath17  but the distance from all other nodes @xmath9 to the newly added @xmath12-th is one plus the smaller distance between @xmath14@xmath9 or @xmath17@xmath9 nodes pairs @xcite : @xmath18    in the case mentioned above of the growth of the simple graphs also the reevaluation of distances between nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 must be done to check if adding a new node provides the shortcut @xcite : @xmath19    in both cases diagonal elements of new row / column are zero @xcite : @xmath20    selecting rows / columns ( nodes to which we attempt to add a new node ) may be random or preferential . in the latter case an additional evolving vector is introduced , which contains the node labels .",
    "these labels occur as vector elements with a probability proportional to the degree of the node",
    ". random selection of elements of such a vector correspond to albert  barabsi construction rule .",
    "the procedure is known as the kertsz algorithm @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath6-th moments of the nnd distribution for all distances @xmath21 = \\dfrac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n [ s^n(i , j ) ] , \\label{eq_ave}\\ ] ] and only for non - zero distances @xmath22 = \\dfrac{1}{n(n-1)}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{\\substack{j=1\\\\j\\ne i}}^n [ s^n(i , j ) ] , \\label{eq_mom}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 $ ] denote an average over @xmath26 matrix elements , an average over @xmath27 non - diagonal matrix elements , and an average over @xmath28 independent realizations of the evolution process ( matrices ) , respectively .",
    "moments and for @xmath29 are sometimes called _ the network diameter_. both double sums in r.h.s . of eqs . and are equal , due to obvious fact , that @xmath30 .",
    "that allows to derive simple dependence between averages @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath31 for the exponential trees  basing on @xmath30 and distance matrix symmetry @xmath32",
    " we are able to construct iterative equations for @xmath33 as dependent on @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36= n^2\\ell^n_n+2\\sum_{i=1}^n \\big(1+[s(i , q)]\\big)^n , \\label{eq_main}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the number of the randomly selected row / column of the distance matrix @xmath7 . combining eq . with eq .",
    "gives the desired iterative formula : @xmath37",
    "for the trees the mean of the nnd @xmath38 and its dispersion @xmath39 grow logarithmically with @xmath11 ( see tabs .",
    "[ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] ) @xcite . for the graphs",
    "only the first cumulant ( the average of the nnd @xmath38 ) grows logarithmically ( see tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "such a slow increase of @xmath38 with number of network nodes is known as the small - world effect @xcite .",
    ".the mean distance @xmath40 for different evolving networks . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the histogram of nnd is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_his ] . as we expected the nnd for the graphs",
    "are more condensed than the nnd for the trees , as well as , the scale - free graphs ( trees ) are more condensed than the exponential graphs ( trees ) .    knowing the moments @xmath41  the averages of the @xmath6-th powers of the non - diagonal distance matrix elements",
    " allows to build all statistical parameters which characterize the nnd distribution , e.g. the average distance @xmath42 , the distance dispersion @xmath43 , its skewness @xmath44 and kurtosis @xmath45 the values of such characteristics of the nnd for the exponential trees obtained via eq .",
    "are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig_mom ] and [ fig_sta ] . for trees ,",
    "the distributions are similar to the poisson distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_his ] ) .",
    "however , even for large @xmath11 the skewness and kurtosis do not vanish as one may expect for the normal distribution @xcite .",
