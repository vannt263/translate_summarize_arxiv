    "next we study polarization properties of 3d models . motivated by 3d simulations of neutrino - driven explosions , where various sizes of complex structure appear , we set up 3d models by randomly placing different numbers of spherical clumps with different sizes .",
    "here we introduce two parameters to depict the model : the size parameter of the clumps @xmath3 , i.e. , the radius of the clump normalized by the photospheric radius ( @xmath4 ) and the photospheric covering factor ( @xmath5 ) . since the optical depth near",
    "the photosphere is the most important for line formation , the covering factor is evaluated by taking into account the clumps only in a shell between @xmath6 and @xmath7 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "note that , as in the 2d cases , the line optical depth in our models has a spherical component and it is enhanced by a factor of @xmath9 within the clumps .",
    "the top panels of figure [ fig:3d ] show the polarization properties of the 3d model with the clump size of @xmath10 and the covering factor of @xmath11 . in the polarization spectrum , both stokes @xmath12 and @xmath13 parameters vary across the lines ( middle panel ) , and polarization shows a loop in the @xmath0 diagram ( right panel ) , as also found by @xcite .    the @xmath0 loop in the 3d clumpy models can be understood as follows . in the 3d clumpy models , depending on the doppler velocities ,",
    "different parts of the photospheric disk are hidden by the clumps .",
    "since the distribution of the clumps does not have a common symmetric axis , the position angle of the polarization can change depending on the doppler velocities .",
    "in general , the change in the position angle across the line can be arbitrary large , i.e. , the polarization in the @xmath0 diagram can be scattered around .",
    "but for the relatively large size of the clumps as in the case of @xmath10 , the same clump keeps contributing to the absorption even for different doppler velocities , and thus the change in the position angle tends to be smooth as a function of doppler velocities .",
    "therefore , the polarization tends to show a loop in the @xmath0 diagram in the 3d clumpy distribution with relatively large clumps .",
    "note that the @xmath0 loop can also be produced by other geometries , e.g. , a combination of the ellipsoidal photosphere and ellipsoidal line scattering shell whose symmetric axes are misaligned with each other @xcite , but even in such a case , it is required that the axisymmetry of the system is broken .    ]     ( top , red ) , @xmath14 ( middle , blue ) , and @xmath15 ( bottom , green ) . for each panel , four different colors ( lighter to darker colors from left to right ) represent models with four different line strengths at the photosphere ( @xmath16 = 3.0 , 10.0 , 30.0 , and 100.0 , respectively ) . for each model , results of 100 lines of sight are shown .",

    "we calculate the polarization spectra with different sizes of the clumps by keeping the covering factor of @xmath21 and other parameters to be the same .",
    "the middle and bottom panels in figure [ fig:3d ] show the results for the 3d models with @xmath14 and @xmath22 , respectively .    as shown in the figures , for a given covering factor",
    ", models with smaller clumps show a lower polarization . in such models ,",
    "the photospheric disk is hidden by many small clumps , and polarization vectors tend to be cancelled out ( figure [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "this behavior was also pointed out by @xcite in the context of type ia sne .",
    "since stripped - envelope sne generally show non - zero line polarization , the typical size of the clumps should not be too small .",
    "since the polarization degree depends not only on the geometry but also on the absorption strength , it is important to compare the models and observations for similar absorption strengths .",
    "therefore , in figure [ fig : pobs_fd ] , we compare models and observations in the plane of the polarization degree and the fractional absorption depth .",
    "the black points with error bars are observational data of the ( filled ) and ( open ) lines for 6 type ib and ic sne analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the small dots show the polarization degree of the models for 100 lines of sight . in each panel , we show four sets of the models with the same size and distribution of the clumps but with the different line optical depth at the photosphere ( @xmath16 = 3.0 , 10.0 , 30.0 , and 100.0 from left to right ) .",
    "when the clump is as small as @xmath15 ( bottom panels of figures [ fig:3d ] and [ fig : pobs_fd ] ) , the polarization degree can not be @xmath23 for any line of sight .",
    "for the larger sizes of the clumps , a higher polarization can be obtained .",
    "when the size of the clumps is @xmath24 ( middle panels ) , the polarization degrees of these models are still short of some of the observed polarization .",
    "when the size of the clumps is relatively large , @xmath10 ( top panels ) , the polarization degree can be as high as @xmath25 for the fractional depth of 0.5 .",
    "ideally the polarization properties of the models should be compared with the statistical distribution of the observed polarization .",
    "although the number of objects with good data is still small , figure [ fig : pdist_size ] shows a cumulative distribution of polarization properties of 6 type ib and ic sne . to define one characteristic polarization for each object , we take the average of the corrected polarization ( @xmath18 ) for the and lines .",
    "color lines show the cumulative distribution of the modelled polarization for 100 lines of sight .",
    "we choose models with @xmath19 , which approximately give @xmath20 ( figure [ fig : pobs_fd ] ) .",
    "the comparison in the cumulative distribution clearly shows that the model with too small clumps ( @xmath15 ) is not consistent with the observations . the @xmath26 value for a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test is @xmath27 .",
    "since the number of objects is so small , we can not distinguish the model with the clump size of @xmath14 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the model with @xmath14 is already short to explain the polarization level of @xmath30 , and seems to close to the lower limit for the clump size . here",
    "it is noted that our models adopt an enhancement factor of @xmath31 .",
    "for a higher enhancement factor , the polarization degree is not largely affected because models with @xmath31 already give an optically thick absorption in the clumps near the photosphere . on the other hand , for a smaller enhancement factor",
    ", the polarization degree decreases for a given fd . in such cases , even larger clumps",
    "is required to reproduce a high polarization degree .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a typical size of the 3d clumps should be @xmath32 of the photospheric radius to reproduce observed polarization degrees .      to obtain possible constraints on the number or the covering factor of the clumps in the ejecta , we vary the covering factors of clumps keeping their size to be @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : pdist_fc ] shows the model input ( left ) and cumulative distributions of the resultant polarization ( right ) . for the models , we choose the line strength at the photosphere to have @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath16 = 30 for the models with @xmath33 , 0.2 , and 0.3 .",
    "@xmath16 = 10 for the models with @xmath34 and 0.7 .",
    "the observed distribution is the same as in figure [ fig : pdist_size ] .    for the model with a smaller covering factor ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "the probability to have a high polarization is also low .",
    "then , by increasing the covering factor of the clumps , a higher polarization can be more frequently observed ( @xmath35 ) . however , if the covering factor of the clumps is too large ( @xmath36 ) , the distribution of resultant polarization shifts toward a lower value again since the system restores the symmetry again .",
    "since the observational samples are small , it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion on the covering factor of the clumps .",
    "however , the models with @xmath33 and @xmath36 are already at the edge of the distribution . by taking into account the fact that models with @xmath31 tend to give an upper limit of the polarization level ( see section [ sec:3d_size ] )",
    ", it seems that current data do not support models with too small covering factors ( @xmath37 ) and too large covering factors ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have modelled line polarization of stripped - envelope core - collapse sne .",
    "the results of modelling are summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the observed @xmath0 loop can not be explained by the 2d axisymmetric models , but can be explained by the 3d clumpy models .",
    "( 2 ) by comparing the results of the 3d clumpy models with the observed degrees of line polarization , it is found that a typical size of the clumps is relatively large , i.e. , @xmath32 of the radius , and a covering factor of the clumps in the ejecta is not too small and not too large ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is intriguing that such a large - scale clumpy structure is also seen in the element distribution of cassiopeia a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is a supernova remnant produced by a type iib sn @xcite .",
    "the similarity suggests that the element distribution as seen in cassiopeia a may also be able to reproduce the polarization properties observed in early phase of sne .",
    "here we discuss possible origins for the clumpy structure suggested by observations and modelling .",
    "one scenario is the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability , causing matter mixing in the sn ejecta . by the rt instability ,",
    "many clumps are produced and metal - rich ejecta inside are delivered toward the outer layers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the rt instability alone usually produces small fingers in many directions .",
    "this is similar to the case of @xmath15 in figure [ fig : schematic ] and not consistent with the observations .",
    "the clumpy structure suggested by observations is more in favor of large - scale convection or sasi developed in the initial stage of the explosion .",
    "when the large - scale convection or sasi takes place , the subsequent evolution of the shock becomes asymmetric , which produces the large - scale asymmetry in the element distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , results of long - term simulations show that the ejecta structure near the shock breakout still keeps an imprint of the large - scale asymmetry generated by neutrino - driven convection and sasi , with the small - scale structures by the rt instability added on top of it @xcite .",
    "note that such long - term simulations for neutrino - driven explosion also nicely reproduce the geometry of cassiopeia a @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that , although the loop in the @xmath0 diagram does not support a purely axisymmetric element distribution ( figure [ fig:2d ] ) , spectropolarimetric data do not rule out the presence of an overall bipolar structure or a dominant axis in the sn ejecta . as long as some large - scale ,",
    "non - axisymmetric components exist , they can produce a large enough polarization level and the loop in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "in fact , analysis of the [ ] line profiles in the late - phase spectra suggest a torus - like distribution of oxygen , which is consistent with a bipolar explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since polarization at the early phase and nebular line profile are sensitive to the outer and inner ejecta , respectively , the combination of early and late phase observations may indicate that global 2d structure exists more in the inner ejecta and 3d clumpy structure is added in the outer ejecta .",
    "it is noted that , even by the late phase observations , presence of clumpy structure has also been suggested by the studies of line profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ionization states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the transition from the inner 2d to the outer 3d structures may be somewhat gradual .",
    "interestingly , our studies suggest that the shape of the loop in the @xmath0 diagram can be used as a probe of such a combined ( 2d @xmath40 3d ) geometry .",
    "as expected from the results of 2d ( figure [ fig:2d ] ) and 3d models ( figure [ fig:3d ] ) , if the ejecta has an overall 2d geometry + 3d clumpy structure , it tends to produce an elongated loop in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "although current observational data do not allow us to extract such information , detailed studies will be possible in future with more observational samples with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "it is emphasized that our modelling includes many simplifications .",
    "for example , we parameterize the line optical depth and enhancement factor , but they must be determined by the combination of element abundance , temperature , and ionization states .",
    "thus , our models shown in the left panels of figures [ fig:2d ] and [ fig:3d ] are not readily connected with the element distribution .",
    "full radiation transfer modelling using 3d hydrodynamic models is required to obtain a closer link between the explosion models and observations .",
    "also , the comparison with observed polarization degree is done by averaging the polarization degrees of different lines .",
    "since polarization at different absorption lines reflects the distribution of each element and ion , the direct comparison for each element is necessary when larger observed samples and full transfer calculations are available .",
    "we have performed 3d radiation transfer simulations for the analysis of line polarization in stripped - envelope sne .",
    "we demonstrate that a purely axisymmetric , 2d structure always produces a straight line in the stokes @xmath0 diagram , and can not explain the commonly observed loop in the @xmath0 diagram . on the contrary",
    ", 3d clumpy structures naturally reproduce the loop .",
    "comparison of the results of the modelling and the observed polarization degrees enables to constrain a typical size of the clumps from polarization data for the first time . to reproduce the distribution of the observed polarization degrees ( 0.5 - 2.0 % ) ,",
    "a typical size of the clump should be relatively large , i.e. , @xmath41 of the photospheric radius ( or the radius where the clump is located ) .",
    "the covering factor of the clump in the ejecta is only weakly constrained i.e. , to @xmath42 % .",
    "such a large - scale clumpy structure inferred by polarization is similar to that seen in the sn remnant cassiopeia a.    the large - scale clumpy structure is unlikely to be produced only by the rt instability as it tends to produce small fingers in many directions .",
    "instead , the presence of the large - scale clumpy structure in the ejecta suggests that large - scale convection or sasi takes place at the onset of the explosion .",
    "polarization properties do not necessarily exclude the presence of a dominant axis in the sn ejecta since non - axisymmetric structure on top of the 2d axisymmetric structure can also reproduce the loop in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "in fact , the analysis of the nebular spectra supports a bipolar geometry in the innermost layer .",
    "these observational constraints suggest that sn ejecta may have an overall 2d bipolar structure inside and 3d clumpy structure outside .",
    "we speculate that such a hybrid structure could be produced by sasi . in order to obtain further constraints on the explosion mechanism ,",
    "polarization modelling using realistic sn models will be worthwhile as more and more long - term realistic simulations from core collapse to the shock breakout are becoming available .",

    "we have developed a new 3d radiation transfer code to compute polarization spectrum of one line from arbitrary 3d distribution of the line optical depth .",
    "the code uses the monte carlo method , which is a common method to compute polarization by scattering processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the application to sne , see @xcite .",
    "we set up the 3d cartesian spatial mesh with the @xmath43 meshes .",
    "the velocity is used as a spatial coordinate because the sn ejecta are homologously expands ( @xmath44 ) , the outer velocity of the grid is @xmath45 25000 km  s@xmath8 , and thus , the resolution is @xmath46 500 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this spatial resolution gives the wavelength resolution of @xmath47 , which is sufficient to make comparison with observed data .",
    "since the code computes only one ( arbitrary ) line , the wavelength range used in the computation is very small .",
    "if the rest wavelength of the line is @xmath48 , we compute the spectrum only at the wavelength range between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . within this wavelength range",
    ", the energy spectrum is assumed to be constant ( @xmath51 = const ) .",
    "our code assumes a sharply defined inner boundary , and solves radiation transfer above the boundary by tracking the photon packets in the expanding ejecta .",
    "every photon packet has assigned energy , wavelength , and stokes parameters .",
    "especially each photon packet in the simulation has a constant energy , irrespective of the wavelength of the packet . because of this treatment , any photon is not lost during the simulation , which results in the accurate energy conservation @xcite .",
    "the position of the inner boundary is determined so that the electron scattering optical depth from the inner boundary to infinity is @xmath52 . in the simulations used in the main text of the paper",
    ", we always adopt @xmath53 ( table [ tab : param ] ) as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the radiation from the inner boundary is assumed to be thermalized , and thus , to be unpolarized ; @xmath54 the direction of the photon is determined by @xmath55 @xcite ( hereafter we use @xmath56 to denote a random number , @xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 is cosine of the angle between the radial and photon direction .",
    "the azimuthal angle around the radial direction @xmath59 is uniformly distributed , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "the emitted photon packets experience the electron scattering and the line scattering , which are treated in a similar way to that by @xcite . for the electron scattering ,",
    "we assume a power - law density structure with the power - law index @xmath61 .",
    "we also have the photospheric velocity ( @xmath62 ) and the epoch from the explosion ( @xmath63 ) as input parameters . the photospheric radius ( @xmath64 ) is defined to be the radius where the optical depth for the electron scattering is unity . by setting @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "the normalization of the electron density is determined .    for the line scattering , we use the sobolev approximation @xcite , and assume a power - law optical depth profile with the same index @xmath61 .",
    "the parameter for the line scattering is @xmath16 , the optical depth at the photosphere .",
    "in addition , we assume enhancement of the optical depth by a factor of @xmath65 in some region .",
    "the parameters used in the simulations are summarized in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "a photon packet propagating in one computational grid can have 3 possible events ; ( 1 ) escaping from the grid , ( 2 ) the electron scattering , and ( 3 ) the line scattering .",
    "the event that actually occurs is judged by calculating the length to the 3 events .",
    "it is simple to compute the length to the next grid @xmath66 for the given position and the direction vector of the photon packet .",
    "the direction to the electron scattering event is computed by the randomly selected event optical depth @xmath67 .",
    "when the optical depth reaches this value , a scattering event occurs .",
    "thus , the distance to the electron scattering @xmath68 can be computed by @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath68 is shorter than @xmath66 , the electron scattering occurs if there is no contribution of line scattering .",
    "since the line scattering is treated as a resonance , the distance to the line scattering event is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the comoving wavelength of the photon packet .",
    "if @xmath72 is shortest among 3 lengths , the line scattering is taken into account .",
    "the line scattering event actually occurs when the sum of the line scattering optical depth ( @xmath73 ) and the electron scattering optical depth in @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) exceeds @xmath76 .",
    "if this sum does not reach @xmath76 , then the electron scattering opacity is evaluated and added again , and the fate of the packet is the electron scattering or the escape from the grid . for illustration of this process , see figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "when the scattering event occurs , the next direction vector of the photon packets is determined . for the electron scattering ,",
    "this scattering angle depends on the polarization , which is discussed in the next section .",
    "for the line scattering , the direction is determined by the isotropic probability function in the comoving frame .    by the scattering event ,",
    "the energy and the wavelength of the packet are changed . for the energy , by the energy conservation in the rest frame , @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the rest - frame energy of the incoming and outgoing packets , respectively . and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the cosines of the angles between the radial direction and incoming / outgoing propagating directions , respectively .",
    "similarly , the change in the wavelength is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the rest - frame wavelength of the incoming and outgoing packet , respectively .",
    "scattering events change the polarization properties of the photon packets . for the electron scattering",
    ", the phase matrix can be written as follows @xcite ; @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the scattering angle on the plane of the scattering .",
    "this matrix should be operated in the scattering frame . in general , the rotation matrix for the stokes parameters is written as follows @xcite ; @xmath87 by using these matrices , the effect on the stokes parameters is given by @xmath88 here @xmath89 and @xmath90 is stokes parameter in the rest frame before and after the scattering , respectively .",
    "the angles @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the angles on the spherical triangle defined as in ( @xcite , see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "equation [ eq : pol_escat ] means that the the angle - dependence of the intensity of the scattered light depends the polarization properties of the incident radiation . from equation [ eq : pol_escat ] ,",
    "the probability distribution function ( @xmath93 ) of the total intensity is @xmath94 by using this function with the rejection method as outlined in @xcite , we determine the scattering angle of the electron scattering .        for the computation of polarization for the electron scattering , the code was tested with the analytic formulae by @xcite for optically thin cases , and with numerical results by @xcite for optically thick cases . for both cases , we got an excellent agreement . for the application to a sn , expanding ejecta with the steep density slope , we checked our results with those by @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that our code gives the consistent results on the radial profile of polarization for several power - law indexes ( @xmath61 ) and the inner boundaries ( @xmath52 ) ."
