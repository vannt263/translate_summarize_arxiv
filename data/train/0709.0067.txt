    "ever since spectral zeta functions of natural geometric elliptic differential operators on manifolds started appearing in mathematics ( @xcite , @xcite ) and in the regularization of path integrals ( @xcite ) , there has been interest in calculating values of the associated zeta determinants .",
    "explicit formulae on various spaces have been derived ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and some authors have displayed numerical features of the behavior of such determinants , culminating in the formulation of conjecture 1 in @xcite , concerning the limit of the determinants of the dirac operator on standard @xmath10-dimensional spheres , as the dimension @xmath10 grows large .",
    "thus it seems an opportune time for investigating rigorously the asymptotics , using the previously established formulae for determinants .",
    "contrary to what one might think , the rather complicated looking series , which involve barnes zeta functions and generalized bernoulli and stirling numbers , can often be understood via quite elementary methods .    in section [ sec : dirac ] we find asymptotics of the effective action for the dirac operator , and of the phase factor sometimes included . as a corollary",
    "this resolves the questions raised in the form of conjecture 1 in @xcite .",
    "the key point in the proof is the use of explicit formulas by thomas branson , br - schopka and j. s. dowker , and application of recursion to control the indirectly defined special functions and polynomial coefficients that appear , along with the functional equation for the riemann zeta function @xmath11 and some elementary estimates of @xmath11 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "see also the book by k. kirsten @xcite ) .    in section [ sec : laplace ] for the laplace - beltrami operator on functions , more refined methods are needed .",
    "the reason seems to be that the ordinary laplacian is not a `` natural object '' to consider . while an approach using polynomial coefficients such as ( generalized ) stirling and bernouilli numbers works well for the more natural conformally covariant yamabe and dirac operators , where in fact the zeta function and derivative at zero tend rapidly to zero , then in the cases when it tends to @xmath12 , formidable cancellations amongst large terms should occur in such sum formulas .",
    "namely for dirac and yamabe the convergence holds with absolute signs inside the bernoulli / stirling expansion sums , while for the ordinary laplacian they do certainly not .",
    "as shown below , the zeta derivative at zero of the ordinary laplacian goes to @xmath6 as the logarithm of the dimension , while the same quantity for dirac and yamabe operators converges exponentially to zero .",
    "the proof in the ordinary laplacian case instead relies on estimating a broad range of barnes zeta functions through convenient contour integral representations .",
    "namely , by exploiting geometry of the situation it is possible to deform the basic hankel contour to make use of a hybrid of laplace s method and the method of stationary phase , the idea of which is exactly that of cancellation of increasingly rapid oscillations .",
    "we note that the standard formulations of the method of stationary phase and laplace s method for contour integrals ( see for example @xcite ) do not seem feasible for the estimates needed here .",
    "what is needed is a mix of these standard tools , due to phase factors which are neither real nor purely imaginary . in this respect",
    "the present paper may also turn out useful for treating similar problems on contour integrals .",
    "as in @xcite , we define the dirac operator determinant including a phase as follows .",
    "@xmath13    to state the theorem , we fix the notation that @xmath14 .",
    "the theorem in particular proves conjecture 1 of @xcite .    for the standard round spheres we have : @xmath15 in fact we have the following asymptotics @xmath16 furthermore we have the inequalities @xmath17    this pattern is also visible in the numerics in @xcite and is interesting in comparison to the present author s results on local extremals of determinants , where that pattern is found to be ( max , max , min , min ) , again depending on the respective dimensions mod @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is yields another example of mod @xmath18 dependencies generically showing up for zeta regularised quantities .",
    "we need to show that , writing from now on @xmath2 for @xmath19 , @xmath20    we firstly review the expressions for the zeta functions of dirac squared , by tom branson @xcite . depending on the parity of @xmath10 we have as follows , in perfect agreement with @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 where the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are integers defined indirectly through the following polynomial expressions in @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 also , to go from branson s formulas , we applied the functional equation @xmath26 since it turns out convenient to express everything in terms of the riemann zeta function @xmath11 .",
    "we shall repeatedly rely on the controllability of @xmath11 along the positive real axis .",
    "in fact we shall apply only the following two quite elementary facts .",
    "@xmath27 for suitably chosen constants",
    ".    if now @xmath10 is odd , we have as always @xmath28 , since the kernel is trivial .",
    "thus we let @xmath10 be even and apply ( [ diracreview ] ) .",
    "recalling the functional equation for the riemann zeta function , in the form most convenient here , @xmath29 we may now rewrite in a form where the asymptotics are more readily seen .",
    "@xmath30 note that for fixed @xmath31 this is a sum in which all the terms have the same sign .",
    "namely @xmath32=(-1)^{k-1-\\alpha},\\ ] ] while @xmath11 is positive , since @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is excluded .",
    "one thing we get from this is @xmath35=(-1)^{k}.\\ ] ] very importantly the constant sign ( for fixed @xmath31 ) allows us to estimate term by term and we write @xmath36 where the positive numbers @xmath37 are defined as @xmath38 the point is now that we can control the indirectly defined polynomial coefficients @xmath22 through a simple recursion . from ( [ dedef ] )",
    "we get @xmath39 note that it is of course implicitly understood that @xmath40 , if @xmath31 is not in the range @xmath41 . by a change of index for the first term and using @xmath42",
    ", this shows the following estimate .",
    "thus for instance with @xmath44 , we get @xmath45 proving in particular the claim that @xmath46 meaning that the phase converges to zero .",
    "furthermore note that with @xmath47 this convergence is indeed rapid , as also witnessed by the numerics of br - schopka .    to deal with the derivative we differentiate ( [ diracreview ] ) at @xmath48 and",
    "use @xmath49 .",

    "this follows since in absolute value , after summing over @xmath56 , it is altogether dominated by @xmath57 where again @xmath44 for example is admissible , since @xmath58 is bounded .    to control now the first term in ( [ evenderiv ] ) , note with @xmath37 from ( [ adef ] )",
    "we have similar estimates here @xmath59 thus we have the desired convergence @xmath60 and in fact @xmath61 with , for example , @xmath62 again .    in odd dimensions the situation is changed only slightly .",
    "the polynomial coefficients are now @xmath23 from ( [ dedef ] ) and as before we have @xmath63=(-1)^{k-1-\\alpha}.\\ ] ] writing now ( [ oddderiv ] ) as @xmath64 with @xmath65 note that once again the signs match up @xmath66=(-1)^{k-1-\\alpha},\\ ] ] and for a constant @xmath67 the estimates @xmath68 hold , and we define a new sequence of positive numbers @xmath69 by @xmath70 again we find recursion relations for the relevant polynomials @xmath71 which gives recursive estimates on the @xmath69 @xmath72 and this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "following @xcite we investigate laplacians of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the scalar curvature ( of @xmath2 ) and the @xmath75 are constants , but may depend on the dimension @xmath10 .",
    "we restrict here to the case @xmath76 .",
    "recalling now that @xmath77 we see that @xmath78 gives the ordinary laplacian , while @xmath79 corresponds to the yamabe operator in each dimension .",
    "note that there is no kernel of the operator @xmath80 in dimension @xmath10 if @xmath81 , and that for @xmath78 the kernel is the constant functions on @xmath2 .",
    "the theorem we will prove in this section is the following .",
    "[ laplacetheorem ] on the standard ( radius of unity ) spheres we have the limits @xmath82 and @xmath83 in fact , we can display the asymptotics as ( for @xmath84 ) @xmath85 and ( for any @xmath10 ) @xmath86    the proof of the claimed limit for the conformal laplacian is easily carried out analogously to the dirac case .",
    "however we give a different type of proof , which works for the ordinary laplacian as well , and is more suitable for exposing the significance of the coupling constant and kernel of the operator .    from @xcite and",
    "@xcite we get the corresponding zeta functions and their first derivatives at zero @xmath87\\:-\\sum_{j=1}^{\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}\\frac{\\alpha_n^{2j}}{j}n_{2j}(n)\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1}\\frac{1}{2i+1}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the notation here , the numbers @xmath88 originate in the contributions from dirichlet ( @xmath89 ) and neumann ( @xmath90 ) boundary conditions on hemispheres . for the ordinary laplacian , the four functions @xmath91 are , by order of appearance in the above equation , @xmath92 . for the yamabe operator it reads @xmath93 .",
    "the notation `` @xmath94 $ ] '' means that this term is only present if @xmath95 has non - trivial kernel .",
    "the numbers @xmath96 are defined using the following polynomials , namely let @xmath97 then @xmath98 finally the zeta functions appearing here are ( special cases of ) barnes zeta functions , where for @xmath99 @xmath100 note that here , if @xmath101 , it is implicit that the term @xmath102 is omitted .",
    "the meromorphic continuation is carried out using the contour integrals @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a left hankel contour , and @xmath105 is defined using the negative real axis branch cut of the logarithm enclosed by @xmath104 .",
    "the contours will be chosen conveniently for getting estimates of the barnes functions .",
    "deformations of the curves must of course respect the branch cut and the possible poles at @xmath106 .",
    "we note a few general features of the barnes zeta functions .",
    "each contour will be taken as the positively oriented boundary of some box @xmath107\\times[-{\\begin{matrix}\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\end{matrix}},{\\begin{matrix}\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\end{matrix}}]$ ] , where @xmath108 is a real - valued function of the dimension @xmath10 .",
    "we denote such a contour by @xmath109 and decompose in the obvious way into one vertical and two horizontal components @xmath110 .",
    "now , since @xmath111 is the norm of the denominator at @xmath112 , we always have @xmath113 on the horizontal parts of the contours . from ( [ barnesintegral ] )",
    "we see , given that @xmath114 , @xmath115 for fixed @xmath116 and @xmath31 , i.e. pointwise convergence to zero of the integrands .",
    "lebesgue dominated convergence theorem can therefore in most case be used to prove that the contribution from a horizontal piece is @xmath117 as @xmath118 , meaning by definition @xmath119 as @xmath118 , for any @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath120 , the derivatives at @xmath48 are , using ( [ gammadiff ] ) @xmath121    if @xmath122 or @xmath123 , then @xmath124 in fact it is @xmath117 as @xmath118 .    for dealing with these cases we use the fixed contour consisting of the positively oriented boundary of the box @xmath125\\times[-{\\begin{matrix}\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\end{matrix}},{\\begin{matrix}\\frac{i\\pi}{2}\\end{matrix}}]$ ] . from the general remarks following ( [ horizontalparts ] ) ,",
    "the horizontal parts of the contours all contribute @xmath117 for @xmath126 , by lebesgue dominated convergence .    in the case",
    "@xmath127 however , note that the continuation of the integral does nt work directly around @xmath48 . from ( [ barnes ] ) we deduce , by straightforward resummation , a family of functional equations @xmath128 thus allowing again for meromorphic continuation to @xmath129 by integral representations .",
    "taking into account the front factor of @xmath130 in ( [ barnesintegral ] ) and using @xmath131 near @xmath132 , shows @xmath133 on the vertical line segments @xmath134 we use @xmath135 and estimate @xmath136 where @xmath137 is any polynomial in @xmath138 and @xmath139 , as in the expressions appearing in ( [ derivatives ] ) and ( [ derivazero ] ) .    in the remaining cases",
    "@xmath140 we focus for the sake of argument on the latter , i.e. @xmath141 then using @xmath142 we see that indeed , by lebesgue dominated convergence , there is rapid convergence to zero , namely @xmath143 concluding the proof .",
    "the next proposition deals with the most complicated of the terms , with parameters @xmath144 and @xmath10 .",
    "here there is no way to deform the hankel contour in the complex plane , respecting the poles and branch cut of @xmath139 , so as to obtain pointwise convergence to zero of the integrand as @xmath145 everywhere along the curve .",
    "this follows from ( [ normofdenom ] ) , since it would imply @xmath146 at some point of the curve , which would thus intersect the logarithmic branch cut .",
