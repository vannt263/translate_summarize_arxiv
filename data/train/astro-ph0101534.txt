    "revealing the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of galaxies is essential in understanding the galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the sfh of the galaxy ( milky way ) is worth studying , since a large number of stars are observed individually and the sfh is inferred directly from the age distribution of the stars .",
    "the sfh is closely related to the chemical evolution of the galaxy . for example , the age  metallicity relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) of galactic stars is generally believed to originate from the chemical enrichment of the galaxy as a result of star formation .",
    "@xcite have pioneered the modeling of the galactic sfh and its chemical evolution . from the correlation between the ultraviolet excess and orbital eccentricity of stars",
    ", they have concluded that the galaxy formed by collapse on a free - fall timescale from a single protogalactic cloud .",
    "an alternative picture of halo formation has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "they have argued that the galactic system formed from the capture of fragments such as dwarf galaxies over a longer timescale than that proposed by eggen et al . in any case , determining the timescale of the infall of matter and the chemical enrichment is an important issue to resolve the formation history of the galaxy .",
    "a number of papers have investigated the formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and chemical evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the galaxy and other spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many models of the sfh of the galaxy have treated the formation of the galactic disk through gas infall from the halo .",
    "this scenario ( the so - called infall model ) can be consistent with the age ",
    "metallicity relation of the disk stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , if a reasonable sfh is used .",
    "moreover , the infall model provides a physically reasonable way of solving the g - dwarf problem ( e.g. , @xcite , p.236 ) , contrary to the closed - box model which tends to overpredict the number of the low - metallicity stars .",
    "since stars are formed from interstellar medium ( ism ) , one of the factors that determine the star formation rate ( sfr ) is the gas content of galaxies .",
    "indeed , the sfr and the gas density is closely related @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used relation is called the schmidt law @xcite .",
    "it assumes that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the gas density and @xmath32 .",
    "as long as such a law is assumed and the infall of gas occurs continuously as a smooth function of time , the predicted sfh is also a smooth function of time .",
    "though the `` classical '' ( i.e. , _ smooth _ ) infall model is widely accepted , there are observational data that suggest _ intermittent _ or _ oscillatory _ star formation activities in spiral galaxies .",
    "this means that the sfh is not a smooth function of time . @xcite",
    "have shown that the ratio of present - to - past sfr in spiral sample has a significant scatter .",
    "more recently , tomita , tomita & sait ( 1996 ) have analyzed the far - infrared to @xmath4-band flux ratio @xmath5 of 1681 spiral galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the indicator @xmath5 represents the ratio between the present sfr and the averaged sfr over the recent gyr .",
    "they have shown order - of - magnitude spread of @xmath5 and suggested a violent temporal variation of the sfr .",
    "the intermittence of the sfh in the galactic disk is recently suggested by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter r00 ) .",
    "they have provided the sfh of the galaxy inferred from the stellar age of the solar neighborhood , using 552 late - type stars .",
    "the age of each star has been estimated from the chromospheric emission in the @xmath6ii h and k lines @xcite .",
    "after metallicity - dependent age correction , completeness correction , and scale - height correction , they have derived the age distribution of the stars . then , after correcting for evolved stars , they have derived the sfh .",
    "they have also asserted that their sfh derived from the stars in the solar neighborhood is representative of the sfh in the whole disk , since the diffusion timescale of stars is much shorter than the galactic age .",
    "the discussion in this paper is based on figure  2 of r00 .",
    "based on their data , r00 have suggested that the star formation activity of the disk is intermittent or variates violently . their suggestion has been statistically confirmed by takeuchi & hirashita ( 2000 , hereafter th00 ) , who have also shown that the typical timescale of the variation is 2 gyr .",
    "we note that @xcite have also found an oscillatory component of the sfh in the solar neighborhood .",
    "theoretically , the intermittent or oscillatory sfh is easily reproduced if we treat the ism as a nonlinear open system @xcite .",
    "* hereafter it83 ) have considered the ism composed of three phases ( cold , warm , and hot ) as suggested by @xcite and modeled the time evolution of the fractional masses of the three components ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the mass exchange among the three components is a nonlinear process , the limit - cycle evolution of the fractional masses can emerge ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the limit - cycle behavior is supported by @xcite , who have interpreted the various levels of the star formation activities in spiral galaxies shown observationally by tomita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the framework of the nonlinear open system model .",
    "their interpretation is based on the galaxy - wide limit - cycle behavior of the ism .",
    "another interesting topic is the chemical evolution in such a limit - cycle ism .",
    "if the oscillatory sfh is considered , we may find an oscillation in a chemical enrichment process .",
    "for example , the age",
    " metallicity relation of the stars in the galactic disk may scatter because of the oscillation .",
    "we will examine quantitatively such a scatter caused by the limit - cycle evolution .",
    "in this paper , we model the oscillatory sfh in the galactic disk proposed by r00 by combining the infall model and the limit - cycle model .",
    "the chemical evolution in the oscillatory sfh is also investigated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in   [ sec : model ] we model the chemical evolution of the galactic disk by using the infall model .",

    "finally , we discuss the sfh and the chemical evolution in the limit - cycle ism in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the chemical evolution model of the galactic disk is constructed here .",
    "the model is based on the infall model , which is characterized by the gradual gas infall from the halo .",
    "we adopt a one - zone model for simplicity . in other words , the phenomena of the ism are averaged in space .",
    "this simple treatment is advantageous because the response of the chemical evolution on the parameters is easy to examine .",
    "when we compare the result with the observational data , however , we should be careful whether the data are averaged or not .",
    "we comment on the one - zone approximation in   [ subsec : onezone ] .",
    "the changing rates of the gas mass ( @xmath7 ) and metal mass ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the species of the metal ; @xmath10 , o , etc . ) in the galactic disk are described by a set of differential equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sfr , @xmath13 is the total injection rate of gas from stars , @xmath14 is the rate of gas infall from halo , @xmath15 is the abundance of @xmath9 ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is the injection rate of element @xmath9 from stars , and @xmath18 is the abundance of @xmath9 in the infall material ( see e.g. , @xcite for the basic treatment of chemical evolution of galaxies ) . introducing @xmath18 enables us to treat the infall of pre - enriched gas .",
    "an early enrichment in the halo may be important for the initial phase of the disk formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we choose two tracers for the metallicity , o and fe .",
    "almost all the oxygen is produced by high - mass stars , while the iron is produced mainly by type ia supernovae ( sne ) as well as by high - mass stars .",

    "the delay time @xmath24 is set to 1.3 gyr , according to   3 of pagel & tautvaiien ( 1995 ) .",
    "we assume that the disk begins to form at @xmath25 .",
    "its age is assumed to be 15 gyr .",

    "this model is used to calculate the time evolution of the mass fraction of the three ism phases ( see also   1 ) .",
    "the result is used to calculate the sfr through equation ( [ eq : schmidt2 ] ) .",
    "the ism is assumed to consist of three components ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) ; the hot rarefied gas ( @xmath60 k , @xmath61 @xmath62 ) , the warm gas ( @xmath63 k , @xmath64 @xmath62 ) , and cold clouds ( @xmath65 k , @xmath66 @xmath62 ) .",

    "apparently , case 3 is important in the interpretation of the oscillatory sfh shown in r00 .",
    "thus , we choose the parameters that satisfy case 3 as will be described in the next subsection .",
    "since the timescale of the variation of sfr derived by r00 is @xmath0 gyr ( see also th00 ) , we first investigate whether the period of the limit - cycle can be the order of 1 gyr .",
    "indeed , a gyr - timescale cycle is possible in the natural parameter range . according to figure 3 of it83",
    ", the period can be @xmath91 when we choose @xmath92 and @xmath93 . since @xmath94 is of the order of @xmath95@xmath96 yr , @xmath97 gyr is possible .",
    "thus , we choose @xmath92 or @xmath93 and @xmath98 yr to demonstrate the gyr - scale oscillation of the galactic sfh .",
    "the subsequent discussions are unchanged if we adopt another set of the parameters that satisfies the oscillation period of @xmath0 gyr .    here",
    "we confirm that the adopted parameters are within the reasonable range of the physical properties of the ism in the galactic disk .",
    "first , @xcite estimated @xmath99 from the sn rate and the maximum radius of an sn remnant ( snr ) and obtained @xmath100 yr@xmath72 .",
    "next , we estimate @xmath101 as the reciprocal of the evaporation timescale of a cold cloud .",
    "the evaporation timescale estimated in @xcite may be applicable in the present case and we obtain @xmath102 yr@xmath72 .",
    "finally , @xmath103 is estimated from the collision rate of a cold cloud with snrs .",
    "the collision rate @xmath104 is estimated as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the typical size of a snr , @xmath107 is the number density of snrs in the interstellar space , and @xmath108 is the typical relative velocity between a snr and a cloud . if we put @xmath109 pc , @xmath110 pc@xmath111 , and @xmath107 are estimated according to @xcite .",
    "we assume that the typical lifetime of a snr is @xmath96 yr . ] and @xmath112 km s@xmath72 , we obtain @xmath113 yr .",
    "this means that @xmath114 yr@xmath72 . @xmath92 and @xmath115 are easily satisfied if we assume for example @xmath116 yr , @xmath117 yr , and @xmath118 yr , all of which are consistent with the above order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "th00 adopted a star formation law @xmath119 and did not consider the effect of a multi - component medium with phase changes . in order to use their choices of the parameter values @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath94 we must relate their @xmath59 ( the timescale in the classical _ smooth _ infall model ) to our @xmath40 ( the one in the _ oscillatory _ infall model ) .",
    "this is achieved by averaging the gas consumption rate defined as @xmath120 ( eq .  [ [ eq : schmidt ] ] ) over the whole galactic age where the oscillatory part of the efficiency is smoothed out and becomes @xmath121 .",
    "in other words , @xmath122 where @xmath123 indicates the time average of the quantity over the galactic history ( @xmath124 gyr ) . since @xmath125 for @xmath126 ( appendix b ) , @xmath127 .",
    "following th00 , we examine the three sets of @xmath128 as summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "they determined the parameters by fitting their infall model to the observed sfh proposed by r00 .",
    "all the three models provide an almost identical sfh and reproduce the smoothed trend of the sfh ( t00 ) .",
    "thus , it is meaningful to examine all the three cases .",
    "however , model a gives an infall timescale much larger than that in e.g. , @xcite , although they assumed the same time dependence of infall as that in this paper .",
    "this long timescale indicates that the infall rate is almost constant over the history of the galactic disk .",
    "we note that model a predicts the highest metallicity of the three models (   [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "here we should comment on the delayed production approximation .",
    "it assumes that all the delayed production at @xmath19 is determined by the sfr at @xmath129 . in reality",
    ", @xmath24 differs among type ia sne .",
    "thus , the delayed production is determined by the averaged sfr around @xmath129 .",
    "expecting that the lifetimes of type ia progenitors are comparable to , or longer than , 1 gyr ( @xmath130 ) the averaged sfr around @xmath129 is described as @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the gas mass at @xmath129 and equation ( [ eq : def_tsf ] ) is used .",
    "thus , we hereafter assume that @xmath133      following it83 , the structure of a model galaxy is approximated by one zone .",
    "the simplicity of the one - zone approximation gives the advantage that the background physical processes are easy to see . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the one - zone treatment .",
    "habe et al .  (",
    "1981 ) stated in their   7 that for the one - zone assumption to be acceptable it is necessary that the mean distance between supernova remnants ( snrs ) be less than 100 pc if a characteristic lifetime of snrs of @xmath134 yr and a mean expansion velocity of 10 km s@xmath72 are adopted .",
    "this is because the snrs should affect the whole disk for the one - zone treatment .",
    "a distance of less than 100 pc means that there are @xmath135 snrs in a galaxy disk , if the disk size of 10 kpc is assumed . this number is reasonable if sne occur every @xmath136 yr ( @xmath137 [ yr]/@xmath138 ) .",
    "considering that the sn rate in a spiral galaxy is typically 1/1001/50 yr@xmath72 ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1993 ) , the mean distance between snrs is less than 100 pc even if 1020 massive stars are clustered in a region .",
    "the information of a place can travel over a distance of @xmath139 in one period of the limit cycle , where @xmath140 is the effective sound speed in the ism and @xmath141 is the oscillatory period .",
    "estimating these quantities as @xmath142 km s@xmath72 ( a typical velocity dispersion in the interstellar space ) and @xmath143 gyr , we obtain @xmath144 kpc .",
    "thus , the information of the limit - cycle behavior can propagate over the whole disk .",
    "thus , the assumption of the limit - cycle behavior over the whole disk may be good . in this paper , as a first step , we treat the model galaxy as being a one - zone object . here",
    "we should note that the gas transport in the radial direction is difficult if we consider the angular momentum conservation .",
    "this difficulty may be a cause of the radial gradient of the metallicity and the gas - to - star fraction in spiral galaxies .",
    "the above discussions are not a satisfactory `` proof '' for the limit - cycle oscillation on the scale of the whole galactic disk .",
    "( but it is important that it is not rejected . ) at present , thus , the cyclic star formation over the whole disk is an assumption that easily explains the variation of the star formation activity observed in the solar neighborhood by r00 .",
    "we note that it also explains the variety of the star formation activity of spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) . hence , in this paper , we base our discussion on the limit - cycle behavior on a whole - disk scale .",
    "when we compare our result with the observational data , we should carefully consider to what extent the data is averaged .",
    "the range of galactocentric radii that enter in the average depends on the age . considering that the diffusion of stellar orbits on a scale of 1 kpc occurs in 0.2 gyr @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that the observational quantities are averaged on a scale of more than 1 kpc .",
    "thus , as a first step , we adopt the one - zone treatment for the galactic disk to see the chemical evolution in an oscillatory sfh . we should extend our model to multi - zone treatment as @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent work ) in the future .",
    "observationally , the formalism in @xcite may be useful in order to link the global observed sfh with the sfh in different galactocentric annuli .",
    "the initial condition is set as follows : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "the convergence to the limit - cycle occurs on the timescale of a few periods .",
    "the results are however not strongly dependent on the choice of the initial conditions for @xmath39 and @xmath67 .",
    "in this section , the results calculated from the equations above are presented .",
    "they are compared with the observational data . before displaying the results , we review the solving processes of the equations .",
    "first , the mass fraction of the cold gas , @xmath39 , is calculated by equations ( [ eq : cold ] ) and ( [ eq : hot ] ) .",
    "@xmath39 is used to determine the sfr at @xmath19 through equation ( [ eq : schmidt2 ] ) . as for the delayed contribution expressed in @xmath150",
    ", we take into account the scatter of the lifetimes of progenitors of type ia sne (   [ subsec : delay ] ) and assume equation ( [ eq : delayedsfr ] ) .",
    "the sfh and the chemical evolution are modeled by the infall model .",
    "the evolution of the gas mass normalized by the total available gas mass @xmath33 is calculated by equations ( [ eq : normalgas ] ) . for @xmath59 and @xmath57 , we examine three cases listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these three cases are also examined in th00 .",
    "the chemical evolution is calculated by equation ( [ eq : normalmetal ] ) .",
    "the sfh calculated by our model is presented in figure [ fig1]_a_. since the three models predict almost the same sfh as indicated by th00 , we present only the result of model a in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we also show the sfh observationally determined by r00 in figure [ fig1]_b _ in order to demonstrate the qualitative similarity between the model prediction and the observation .",
    "we test the model with the metallicity data of galactic stars . age  metallicity relation , g - dwarf metallicity distribution , and [ fe / o][fe / h ] relation are examined .",
    "first of all , we should note that the yields may be uncertain because of the treatment of convection , nuclear reaction rates , mass loss in the asymptotic giant branch phase , etc .",
    "if the yields are systematically larger / smaller than assumed in this paper , the metallicities predicted by our model should be systematically larger / smaller .",
    "thus , quantitative agreement by fine tuning of the parameters might be meaningless .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior of the metallicity evolution in the limit - cycle ism is not altered even if the yield changes .",
    "metallicity relation of stars in the galactic disk provides us with information on its chemical enrichment history .",
    "thus , our model is worth testing by using the age ",
    "metallicity relation of the stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the sample is provided by @xcite , which used the same sample as r00 .",
    "first , we examine the case where the infall gas is of primordial abundance [ i.e. , ( @xmath151 @xmath152 . the age  metallicity relation predicted by our model is shown in figure [ fig2]_a_. the solid , dotted , and dashed lines represent the results in models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "we also present the observational data of the age ",
    "metallicity relation by @xcite ( see their table 3 ) . model a predicts the highest present metallicity , since its short gas consumption timescale leads to the most efficient chemical enrichment . even in model",
    "a , however , the discrepancy between the model prediction and data is significant in the low - metallicity range .",
    "@xcite noted the high initial metallicity of the disk and attributed it to the pre - enrichment of the gas before the formation of the first stars in the disk .",
    "they also have shown that the age ",
    "metallicity relation determined from the chromospheric age can deviate upward ( i.e. , metallicity is overestimated ) for larger ages from the real relation because of the uncertainty in the age estimation .",
    "thus , we also examine the case where the infalling gas in enriched with metal [ @xmath48 ] .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig2]_b_. we see that the discrepancy between the model prediction and the observational data is reduced . from the viewpoint of modeling ,",
    "the yield is also uncertain .",
    "thus , we do not try any fine - tuning the age  metallicity relation .    in spite of such uncertainty , we can discuss the qualitative behavior of the age  metallicity relation .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation of metallicity is smaller than the typical scatter of the observed data points ( @xmath154 dex ) .",
    "the small amplitude is natural , because metallicity is determined by all the past history of star formation , and thus the present oscillatory star formation does not significantly contribute to the metallicity .",
    "rocha - pinto et al.s data shown in figure [ fig2 ] seem to show a recent increase in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the pre - enriched infall can not solve this increase , since the infalling gas has too low a metallicity .",
    "however , we should carefully examine whether the most recent data point in figure [ fig2 ] represents the sfh of the whole galactic disk , because if the recent chemical enrichment rate in the solar neighborhood is significantly higher than that in the whole galaxy , the most recent data point would naturally show a systematically higher metallicity .",
    "moreover , data sets shown by other authors do not necessarily show such an increase in the recent metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is necessary to analyze the observational data further before we construct a theoretical model for the recent [ @xmath155 ( gyr ) ] increase in metallicity .",
    "we can expect that the oscillation behavior is more prominent for oxygen than for iron , because all the oxygen is produced from the `` instantaneous '' part ( i.e. , @xmath156 ) .",
    "we present the result for the case of pre - enriched infall [ i.e. , @xmath48 ] in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of the oscillation is larger than figure [ fig2]_b_. however , the oscillation would not explain the scatter of the oxygen abundance of the stars in the galactic disk .",
    "the g - dwarf metallicity distribution is also tested along with our model , since the primary motivation for the infall model is to solve the g - dwarf problem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath157 of the metallicity is calculated from our model as @xmath158 where the constant @xmath159 is the normalization so that @xmath160 from equation ( [ prob_x ] ) , we obtain the following analytical expression for @xmath161 : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is calculated from equation ( [ eq : normalmetal ] ) . in comparing the distribution function with the observational data , we should take into account the scatter of the data . here",
    ", we simply convolve @xmath161 with a gaussian kernel as @xmath164\\ , d u \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we adopt @xmath165 to compare with @xcite .",
    "we adopt these data because we would like to use a sample of g - dwarfs , whose lifetimes are comparable to the age of the universe . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show @xmath166 as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed lines represent the result in models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "the histogram shows the data by @xcite .",
    "the two figures ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) correspond to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ( same as fig .",
    "[ fig2]_a _ and _ b _ , respectively ) .",
    "we see that model a in figure [ fig4]_b _ seems to be the best of all the models .",
    "however , considering the uncertainty in the yields , we do not try any fine tuning .",
    "the excess of the observed number of stars around @xmath50}\\sim 0.0 $ ] is consistent with the data by @xcite . as stated in ",
    "[ subsec : amr ] , this may be due to the recent significant enrichment in the solar neighborhood .      in order to test the effect of the limit - cycle behavior on the [ fe / o ] ratio",
    ", we examine the relation between [ fe / o ] and [ fe / h ] . since the oxygen is mainly produced by stars with short lifetimes , the effect of the limit - cycle ism is reflected by the time evolution of the oxygen abundance . on the other hand ,",
    "the iron is also produced by stars with long lifetimes and the information of the oscillation of ism phase is lost in the iron abundance .",
    "thus , we expect that [ fe / o ] oscillates as the limit - cycle evolution of ism .    in figure [ fig5 ] ,",
    "we show [ fe / o][fe / h ] relation .",
    "the solid , dotted , and dashed lines represent the results in models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "the two figures ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) correspond to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ( same as fig .",
    "[ fig2]_a _ and _ b _ , respectively ) .",
    "indeed , we see that [ fe / o ] oscillates . however , the amplitude of the oscillation is not large .",
    "this is consistent with the age  metallicity relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . as mentioned in   [ subsec : amr ] ,",
    "the amount of metallicity reflects the past - integrated sfr ; thus , as long as the mass of newly formed stars is not dominated in the total stellar mass , the present oscillation has little influence on the metallicity evolution .",
    "in this paper , we have modeled the oscillatory sfh proposed observationally by r00 .",
    "our model is a combination of an infall model developed in the field of chemical evolution and the limit - cycle model proposed by @xcite and his collaborators .",
    "we discuss our result in the following two subsections .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the galactic sfh proposed by r00 is modeled by using the limit - cycle model of sfh .",
    "the limit - cycle behavior of the three - phase ism is suggested by @xcite and his collaborators . since the period of a limit - cycle orbit can be @xmath0 gyr within the framework of @xcite , the galactic sfh",
    "is explained by the limit - cycle model of the ism .",
    "recently , @xcite have explained the observed scatter of star formation activity of a sample of spiral galaxies by using the limit - cycle model .",
    "they provided a consistent modeling that explains the variation in the scatter of star formation activity among the morphological types ( sa  sc ) as shown in kennicutt et al .",
    "since the galaxy is a spiral galaxy , an oscillatory sfh is consistent with the variation of star formation activity seen in other spirals .",
    "kennicutt et al .  (",
    "1994 ) have also presented the ratio of the present sfr to the past averaged sfr ( indicated as @xmath101 there ) . from figure 2 of r00",
    ", we see that @xmath101 ( denoted as @xmath167 in r00 ) can be as large as 23 for the galactic sfh .",
    "since the morphological type of the galaxy is sbc ( e.g. , @xcite , p.  171 ) , @xmath1683 is within the range of the sbc / sc sample in kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1994 , their fig .",
    "this consistency implies that the oscillatory sfh may be a common nature for all the spiral galaxies .",
    "the chemical evolution of the galaxy has been investigated in the framework of the limit - cycle ism model .",
    "we have found that the amplitude of the oscillatory behavior of the metallicity is smaller than the observed scatter ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the observed scatter is not attributed to the limit - cycle behavior .",
    "the scatter might be explained by chemical inhomogeneity in the galactic disk .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the metallicity is not prominent because the metallicity reflects all the past sfh .",
    "the integrated contribution from all the past sfh smoothes out the oscillatory behavior of sfr .",
    "thus , from the viewpoint of chemical evolution we conclude that we can not distinguish between the `` smooth '' infall model without an oscillatory behavior and the oscillatory infall model proposed in this paper .",
    "contrary to the metallicity , the dust - to - gas ratio can show a oscillatory behavior @xcite .",
    "this is because the efficiency of the dust formation changes according to phase changes in the gas .",
    "moreover , dust is efficiently destroyed when the mass fraction of the cold gas is small .",
    "this oscillation of dust amount may be important for the evolution of infrared luminosity of galaxies .",
    "@xcite gave some indication that the magellanic clouds could play a role in the sfh of the galaxy .",
    "it is meaningful to explore their idea . since our discussion is based on the limit - cycle behavior inherent in the ism as stated in   1 , we do not include the external force into our formulation .",
    "fortunately , @xcite have investigated the behavior of the ism in the presence of such an external force .",
    "thus , we discuss the influence of the magellanic clouds based on the discussion in @xcite .    if a perturbation of the external force to the limit - cycle ism exists , both the period and the amplitude of the oscillation are affected .",
    "thus , it is not necessary that the period proper to the ism is about 1 gyr . even in the stable - focus case (   [ subsec : model ] ) , an oscillation emerges .",
    "furthermore , the qualitative behavior can be changed : the system can show a chaotic orbit .",
    "since the observational data do not reject such a chaotic orbit affected by the perturbation of the magellanic clouds , the strongly variable sfh of the galaxy might be due to the interaction with the magellanic clouds .",
    "however , we note that the large scatter of the star formation activity of the spiral sample ( e.g. , tomita et al .",
    "1996 ) implies a general oscillatory behavior of ism in spiral galaxies .",
    "this is naturally explained if such an oscillatory behavior is caused by the limit - cycle evolution inherent in the ism .    finally , we would like to note that chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have also considered sfr variation due to a different mechanism .",
    "their rapidly variable sfr is caused by a density threshold for star formation : they assumed that star formation occurs only if the surface density of the gas exceeds a critical value , while we have assumed no threshold .",
    "however , the timescale of the sfr variation in chiappini et al.is much shorter than 1 gyr .",
    "although chiappini et al.s mechanism may indeed present on a timescale much shorter than 1 gyr , it is necessary to introduce a mechanism different from chiappini et al.in order to explain the sfr variability presented by r00 .",
    "thus , we have proposed a limit - cycle scenario for the sfr in the galactic disk .",
