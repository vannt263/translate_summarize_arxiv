    "amphiphilic molecules in the aqueous solvent assemble into a bilayer membrane , and form a closed vesicle .",
    "a typical example is an artificial lipid - bilayer , which serves as a model for biomembranes .",
    "vesicles of a lipid - bilayer membrane have been studied as a model system of living cells over a couple of decades . in particular , after helfrich proposed an elastic continuum model of the membrane @xcite , many works have been made about the morphology of the vesicles . even in the case of a single component , vesicles take various shapes , and their shapes are classified as spherical , prolate , oblate , pear , stomatcyte and so on , according to seifert et al.@xcite    actually , biomembranes might be more complex by containing many components such as several different species of lipids or membrane proteins .",
    "impurity lipid molecules and proteins can move freely within the two - dimensional liquid state of the membrane and perform diffusive motion . via the coupling to the membrane curvature , impurities may affect the shape of the vesicle . also the vesicle can enclose cytoskeletons in its interior space .",
    "cytoskeletons consist of microtubles and/or intermediate filaments , and form a three - dimensional network inside a cell to support the cell shape . also for the cell locomotion ,",
    "the elongation and the shortening of filamental proteins in the vesicle are required.@xcite thus in the study of living cells , the consideration of the interaction between lipid bilayer membranes and such encapsulated materials is indispensable .    to study the role of such materials , several experiments have been made .",
    "hotani and miyamoto@xcite established a model system where microtubules polymerize in a vesicle .",
    "a growing microtuble pushes the vesicle membrane at contact points and deforms it into the shape resembling a greek letter @xmath0 .",
    "there have been many experiments and theoretical analyses on this phenomenon .",
    "it was established that to realize the @xmath0-shape , the osmotic pressure inside the vesicle has to be higher than the outer pressure,@xcite or the volume of the vesicle has to be fixed .",
    "@xcite it is also found that the monopolar asymmetric @xmath0-shape has a lower energy and is stabler than the bipolar mirror symmetric shape .    when the filaments in the vesicle are soft such as actin filaments , they bend and form a ring in the vesicle .",
    "the experiment of such cases was performed by miyata and hotani@xcite .",
    "they observed that ring filaments in a vesicle push the vesicle outward and deform the spherical vesicle into a disk shape .",
    "shape transformation caused by the phase separation within the membrane occurs in many important natural phenomena such as cell locomotion , fusion , secretion , endocytosis , phagocytosis etc .",
    "furthermore , various experiments have been performed on this type of shape changes in multi - component vesicles .",
    "one example of the experiments is on the transition from a biconcave shape of erythrocytes to a crenated one ( echinocytosis ) @xcite .",
    "another one is on a shape deformation induced by the phase separation of the amphiphiles composing the membrane@xcite .",
    "also there is an experiment on a shape deformation caused by proteins@xcite or polymers which are anchored in membranes@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "vesicles transform from the spherical shape to the one with a budding or from a tubular shape to a pearling one .",
    "the effect of impurity on the vesicle morphology was first analyzed by s. leibler@xcite .",
    "he showed that the impurities diffusing within the two - dimensional membrane couple to the curvature and destabilize the flat membrane .",
    "recently , dynamical simulations of two - component vesicles have been performed @xcite and the coalescence process of the budding vesicle was obverved@xcite .    in this paper , we study morphology of a three - dimensional axisymmetric vesicle with encapsulated filaments or embedded impurities , by solving purely dissipative dynamics . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the model hamiltonian of a vesicle is introduced , and its dissipative dynamics is formulated . in section [ sec3 ] , the shape of the vesicle encapsulating a rod filament is studied . as a linear filament elongates , vesicular shape alters from a sphere to a rugby - ball , and to a sphere with tubular protrusions .",
    "the shape transition is summarized in a phase diagram in the phase space of the vesicular volume and a filament length . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we study the case of ring filaments .",
    "when filaments in the vesicle are soft such as actin filaments , they bend and form a ring .",
    "as the filament extends their length , the ring pushes out the vesicle membrane and deforms the prolate vesicle into the oblate one . in the case of cell division , the ring filament shrinks .",
    "relations between the ring - force and the vesicle shape or the ring radius are studied in this case , and the morphological transition is summarized in the phase diagram . in section [ sec5 ] , we study the effect of impurities embedded in the membrane on the vesicle shape , and observed that impurities diffusing within the vesicle surface induce curvature instability .",
    "a linear stability analysis around a spherical vesicle is confirmed in our simulation of the vesicle under several conditions .",
    "we have further simulated the nonlinear coalescing process in the late stage .",
    "whole analysis is summarized in section [ sec6 ] .",

    "the beltrami - laplace operator is represented as = _ s ( _ s ) . [ 9 ] the variation of the elastic energy produces only the normal component of the velocity , because only this component has the physical significance .",
