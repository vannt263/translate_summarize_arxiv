    "is it _ in situ _ formation , proportional to the star - formation in the outskirts ? or has it been transported out in some type of radial flow ( similar to stellar migration ) or perhaps the product of recent accretion that is not as pristine as originally thought ? it is likely a combination of all of the above .",

    "based on the balmer decrement ( h@xmath4/h@xmath5 ratio ) , several model attenuation laws have been put forward by @xcite . using either multiple broad - band filters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
