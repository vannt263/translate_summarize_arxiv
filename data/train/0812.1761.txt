    "numerical simulations stand as a fundamental tool to analyze strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "basically , two different approaches have proven very powerful .",
    "the first one corresponds to monte carlo simulation , which can be applied to most systems with the exception of those that present a sign problem .",
    "a second approach is based on introducing a structured ansatz for _",
    "e.g. _ the ground state of the system that captures as much of its entanglement properties as possible .",
    "the kind of structure which is best suited for a given system will depend on its dimensionality , symmetry properties and geometry of interactions .",
    "a widely used structured ansatz to handle one - dimensional systems corresponds to matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this approach consists of representing states via their correlations rather than their coefficients in position or momentum space .",
    "quantum states that carry little entanglement are well described by mps @xcite .",
    "this is the case of one - dimensional off - critical states . there",
    ", mps produces a very precise approximation to all the properties of the state .",
    "the mps approach deteriorates at criticality since conformal invariance is recovered and quantum correlations pervade the system . yet , mps remains a useful tool in that regime . in higher dimensions",
    ", mps must be substituted with the so - called projected entangled pairs ( peps ) @xcite .",
    "a conceptually different structured ansatz corresponds to tensor networks that do not encode the standard nearest neighbor topology but , rather , a renormalization group tree .",
    "tree tensors and , in particular , the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite may well turn into a powerful method to deal with critical quantum systems in any number of dimensions . in this paper , we shall concentrate on finding exact results for the mps approximation .",
    "the issue of finding an optimal mps representation for the ground state of an infinite quantum system is not trivial .",
    "a number of results can be found in the literature @xcite ( and references therein ) concerning exact mps in particular cases , exploiting rotational or translational invariance .",
    "it is also possible , for instance , to rewrite the laughlin wave function coefficients as a product of matrices @xcite .",
    "but , in general , exact results are excepcional and it is necessary to resort to a specific numerical algorithm that delivers such a state . in the case of infinite systems ,",
    "two possibilities are at hand : the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite and the euclidean evolution ( itebd ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "both methods have been proven to produce the same results on examples @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it remains an open question whether both algorithms do find the optimal mps approximation to the ground state of a given hamiltonian .",
    "it is also unclear how the mps approximation handles the symmetries present in a hamiltonian .",
    "we shall try to answer both of this questions in this paper .",
    "our approach will exploit the itebd approach in an analytical way and turn the problem of finding optimal mps to a minimization strategy .",
    "thus , the novelty of the method lies in the exactness of this minimization procedure that allows for an explicit analysis of symmetries in the mps context .",
    "we shall present our method and results for the particular case of the isotropic spin-@xmath0 anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg chain .",
    "this thoroughly studied model is suited for our purposes since the mps approximation will make a compromise to handle its symmetries , as we shall see later on .",

    "this theory stands as a reference model to try new ideas to treat strongly correlated systems .",
    "there are a several reasons that justify its relevance .",
    "first , the ground state of the heisenberg spin chain displays critical phenomena , that is , long distance correlations dominate the system and entanglement entropy of a finite block scales logarithmically with its size @xcite .",
    "second , the conformal properties of the heisenberg chain are related to the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "this will be a key ingredient in our analysis .",
    "third , the heisenberg model is exactly solvable using the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "let us be more precise about some of the properties of the heisenberg chain that can be calculated exactly .",
    "the exact energy of the ground state of this model can be worked out via the bethe ansatz , @xmath6 . the itebd algorithm that we shall present later on , will work as a variational method based on energy minimization strategy .",

    "the ground state of the heisenberg spin chain turns out to verify translational invariance up to a sign .",
    "that is , the ground state is invariant under translating all spins by one position if , simultaneously , all of them are flipped .",
    "this property is rooted at the combination of the anti - ferromagnetic character of the heisenberg interaction and the 2-body nearest neighbor decomposition of the hamiltonian .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we call this symmetry `` quasi translational invariance '' .",

    "the basic idea consists in evolving some initial state in imaginary time .",
    "provided that its overlap with the ground state is different from zero , the imaginary time evolution converges towards the ground state of the system .",
    "this strategy can be implemented using the trotter decomposition @xcite that allows to decompose the imaginary time evolution of the total hamiltonian in small steps , each one corresponding to the imaginary time evolution of a piece of the hamiltonian . moreover , whenever the hamiltonian is made of two - body nearest - neighbor interactions , it can be written as a sum of two non - commuting pieces which are made of commuting terms . within each non - commuting subspace , the action of the hamiltonian on the evolution of the state reads as a product of exponentials acting on two adjacent sites .",

    "let us emphasize that the itebd algorithm distinguishes as many sites as the number of terms involved in the local interaction .",
    "for instance , a hamiltonian made with interactions that involve next - to - nearest - neighbor sites would be handled by itebd using three type of matrices @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and a three - step iteration euclidean evolution .",
    "note as well that , in our case , the itebd algorithm incorporates explicitly two - site translational invariance .",
    "the choice for the parameter @xmath47 of the mps , that is the size of the matrices in the ansatz ( often called @xmath5 in dmrg literature ) controls both the computational cost and accuracy of the approximation .",

    "in such a case , we should be able to construct from the 1-body reduced density matrix an observable that shall not depend on the gauge .",
    "since the elements of the density matrix depend explicitly on the local basis , the unique parameters that are invariant under local unitary transformations shall be its eigenvalues , that we call @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , note that the trace of the 1-body reduced density matrix is also constrained to be equal to one .",

    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , since both of them parametrize the effects due to the finiteness of @xmath47 .",
    "beyond the well - known numerical strategies for computing a matrix product state approximation , exact results for the ground state of a low dimensional mps can be found using an analytical minimization strategy .",

    "this means that both methods avoid local minima and find the optimal solution consistent with the mps ansatz .",
    "second , a generic mps does not preserve any symmetry of the problem beyond the 2-site translational invariance due to the fact that the algorithm looks for a minimum of the hamiltonian expectation value . thus , for the heisenberg chain , the 1-site translational invariance of its ground state , and the property of being eigenstate of the total @xmath7-component of spin are explicitly violated .",
    "however , it is possible to constrain the mps to preserve one of them while remaining an absolute minimum for the energy . yet ,",
    "if both symmetries are imposed at the same time the mps ansatz does not get down to the same minimum .    for low-@xmath47 mps",
    "it is not difficult to find the suitable parametrization that allows us to preserve a chosen symmetry , as we have shown on examples .",
    "it is also possible to quantify symmetry restoration using , as a figure of merit , the difference of eigenvalues of the 1-body reduced density matrix .",
    "we observe that symmetry gets restored when @xmath47 increases following a detailed scaling law .",
    "the method we have presented can be extended to any local hamiltonian that displays translational invariance .",
    "this is the key ingredient to reduce the computation to a simplified minimization . beyond nearest - neighbor interactions or higher spins",
