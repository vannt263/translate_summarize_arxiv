    "one of the principal themes of study in the emerging field of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is the examination of the coherent structures that arise in them  @xcite .",
    "when such explorations started over a decade ago  @xcite , they were considerably hindered by either geometric or thermal effects , which were detrimental towards the lifetime of dark solitons and vortices that can be formed in repulsive becs . yet",
    ", the newer generations of experiments have enabled considerable strides towards the observation of dynamics and interactions of such nonlinear waveforms  @xcite .",
    "hyperfine states used for these images are given to the right of each component.,width=321 ]    in addition to the above context of single - component becs , soliton and vortex states may also arise in multi - component condensates , such as the two - component pseudo - spinor becs , or the three and higher component spinor becs  @xcite .",
    "one of the prototypical examples of a soliton state in these settings is the so - called dark - bright ( db ) soliton  @xcite .",
    "experimental images of db solitons in a two - component bec are presented in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] .",
    "the bec in this figure is comprised of two different hyperfine states of @xmath0rb , and the solitons are generated by subjecting the bec to inter - component counterflow ; details of this technique are described in refs .",
    "@xcite . in each panel ,",
    "the atom clouds of the two components are vertically offset for imaging only , while all the dynamics leading to the soliton formation occurs in overlapped clouds .",
    "clear examples of dark - bright solitons are marked as `` db '' in the figure and they consist of a dark soliton in one component that is coupled to a bright soliton in the second component .",
    "these structures can be thought of as `` symbiotic '' ( or even parasitic ) states because their bright component can not be supported alone in the case of repulsive interactions @xcite ; in fact , the bright soliton is only sustained because of the presence of its dark - counterpart , which operates as an external trapping potential .",
    "although dark - bright solitons ( and even a prototypical interaction thereof ) were first observed some time ago in the context of nonlinear optics  @xcite , their observation in recent atomic becs experiments  @xcite triggered a sizeable burst of research activity centered around them .",
    "topics of study included ( but were not limited to ) multi - db soliton solutions from the viewpoint of integrable systems  @xcite , numerical study of db soliton interactions  @xcite , discrete db solitons  @xcite , experimental realizations of db soliton trains  @xcite , db soliton oscillations and interactions  @xcite , as well as interaction of db solitons with localized impurities @xcite .",
    "recently , a `` cousin '' of these db solitons , namely the dark - dark ( dd ) soliton  which involves two dark solitons but with potentially a breathing oscillation between their densities was also experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "pertinent examples are marked as `` dd '' in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] .",

    "[ fig : perturb2 ] below ) .",
    "such `` beating dark - dark solitons '' are expected to emerge in the integrable two - component ( so - called manakov ) limit of the relevant mean - field theoretic models  @xcite and were , in fact , earlier observed in numerical experiments involving the dragging of defects through the binary condensates  @xcite .",
    "the current experimental advances , such as the ones leading to the soliton images of fig .",
    "[ experiment ] , motivate the present theoretical study , in which we revisit dd soliton states at the integrable manakov limit and extract information from their connection to the db solitons ( section ii ) .",
    "these results are corroborated by the identification of such single dd soliton states , as genuine periodic orbits of the manakov case ( with and without a trap ) and the study of their stability , internal modes and associated near - equilibrium dynamics ( section iii ) .",
    "in addition , we examine the dynamics of individual such solitons , upon departure from the integrable limit ( section iv ) .",
    "experimentally it has also become possible to generate several solitons , and even solitons of different types , in a single bec ",
    "see , e.g. , the third panel of fig .  [ experiment ] which demonstrates the coexistence of dark - bright and dark - dark solitons .",
    "although the experimentally exploited counterflow between the two components is beyond the scope of our current analysis , these experimental findings motivate our investigation of the interactions between two dark - dark solitons ( section v ) . finally , conclusions of our study , as well as a number of interesting perspectives for future work , are also presented ( section vi ) .",

    "quantifying further ( and semi - analytically , if possible ) the interactions between the beating dark - dark solitons , as well as studying in more detail the dark - antidark solitons that appear to spontaneously arise from their breakup in the miscible regime are interesting extensions of this work in the one - dimensional setting . on the other hand ,",
    "one naturally may consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) generalization of the considerations herein , especially upon bearing in mind that the su(2 ) ( or so(2 ) ) rotations used herein are not restricted to the one - dimensional realm in any particular way . in that regard",
    ", one may envision vortex - bright soliton states  @xcite ( i.e. , the 2d analog of the dark - bright waves ) rotated via so(2 ) to produce vortex - vortex type states ( in analogy to the dark - dark ones ) . such states are currently under study and will be reported in future publications .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experimental results , we study beating dark - dark solitons as a prototypical coherent structure that emerges in two - component bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we showcase their connection to dark - bright solitons via so(2 ) rotation , and infer from it both their intrinsic beating frequency and their frequency of oscillation inside a parabolic trap . </S>",
    "<S> we identify them as exact periodic orbits in the manakov limit of equal inter- and intra - species nonlinearity strengths with and without the trap and showcase the persistence of such states upon weak deviations from this limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider large deviations from the manakov limit illustrating that this breathing state may be broken apart into dark - antidark soliton states . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the dynamics and interactions of two beating dark - dark solitons in the absence and in the presence of the trap , inferring their typically repulsive interaction . </S>"
