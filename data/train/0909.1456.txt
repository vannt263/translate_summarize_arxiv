    "the mdf of @xcite appears to exhibit a metal - poor tail and our results for mgc1 suggest that there must be at least _ some _ very metal - poor component to the extremely remote outer halo of m31 .",
    "however on the whole it seems that the most distant globular clusters in m31 are more metal - poor than the bulk of the field halo stars at comparable radii .",
    "another remarkable feature of mgc1 is its extremely extended outer structure .",
    "cluster members are clearly visible at large radii , and these are apparently fairly homogeneously distributed azimuthally .",
    "we have traced the radial profile of mgc1 to at least @xmath143 pc and possibly as far as @xmath10 pc , rendering it by far the most extended globular cluster hitherto studied .",
    "the most extended cluster in the milky way is ngc 2419 , with @xmath144 pc ; the vast majority of the galactic population have @xmath145 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the unique structure of mgc1 likely reflects its unmatched remote location , away from any strong tidal forces which might act to impose a tight limit on its radial extent . the expected tidal radius of a globular cluster of mass @xmath146 orbiting a galaxy of mass @xmath147 at a galactocentric radius @xmath148 is given by : @xmath149 adopting our measured parameters for mgc1 ( @xmath150 kpc and @xmath151 ) along with a typical @xmath152-band mass - to - light ratio for a globular cluster @xmath153 and the mass of m31 from @xcite , @xmath154 , we find the expected tidal radius for mgc1 is @xmath155 pc .",
    "it is therefore not surprising we have not identified a tidal cut - off in its radial profile .",
    "note that we can not be certain the outermost cluster members are bound to the cluster , since any tidal distortions would not necessarily lie in the plane of the sky .",
    "however , the lack of any clear spatially asymmetric distribution of these outer members together with the calculation above showing a very large expected @xmath156 suggests more of a halo - type structure than strong tidal tails .    assuming a bound halo of stars around the cluster , the observed power - law fall - off of the profile is not unexpected .",
    "@xcite used @xmath157-body simulations to study the long - term evolution of isolated star clusters .",
    "their models show that an isolated cluster tends to build up a surrounding halo of stars that have been scattered onto radial orbits by two- or three - body encounters in the inner regions of the cluster .",
    "the resulting density profile follows a power - law fall - off as @xmath158 at large radii .",
    "this is very similar to the results from , for example , the monte carlo models of @xcite which predict @xmath159 . in projection",
    "we thus expect a power - law fall - off with an exponent somewhere between @xmath160 , which is entirely consistent with what we observe for the inner profile of mgc1 .    in both sets of models",
    "the core - halo structure takes many median relaxation times to establish over radial ranges of up to @xmath161 pc for mgc1 .",
    "it is therefore perhaps not surprising that we observe a break to a steeper fall - off in the outer regions of mgc1 .",
    "this may reflect the ongoing initial build - up of the cluster s halo , or possibly the re - establishment of this halo after the last pericentre passage of mgc1 which could have brought it much closer to m31 than it is at present .",
    "whatever the case , given that the median relaxation time of mgc1 is likely to be several gyr ( see , for example , the values listed for galactic globulars by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the existence of a core - halo structure at all suggests that mgc1 has been evolving in isolation for a very considerable period of time .",
    "in summary , we have presented resolved photometric measurements of mgc1 from deep gemini / gmos imaging of this remote m31 cluster .",
    "our resulting cmd displays features consistent with those of an ancient stellar population , including a long horizontal branch populated across the instability strip . by fitting isochrones calculated by several different groups , as well as fiducial sequences observed for galactic globular clusters , we determine mgc1 to be a metal - poor object with @xmath1m@xmath2h@xmath3 \\approx -2.3 $ ] .",
    "this is in disagreement with a recent high resolution spectroscopic measurement by @xcite who find a significantly higher metal abundance ; the origin of this discrepancy is not yet clear but it also exists for several other remote m31 globular clusters .",
    "the best - fitting stellar evolution models and globular cluster fiducials suggest that mgc1 lies significantly closer to us than m31 .",
    "our preferred distance modulus is @xmath5 ( corresponding to a line - of - sight distance of @xmath162 kpc ) , compared with the generally accepted value for m31 of @xmath127 ( @xmath25 kpc ) .",
    "combined with the large projected separation between mgc1 and m31 ( @xmath6 kpc ) , our distance measurement implies that mgc1 lies in the extreme outer regions of the m31 halo with a galactocentric radius @xmath7 kpc .",
    "this renders it the most isolated known globular cluster in the local group by some considerable margin .",
    "even so , the radial velocity measured for this object @xcite is within the m31 escape velocity and consistent with that expected for an m31 halo member at the radius of mgc1 .    by measuring the radial brightness profile of mgc1",
    "we have established that this cluster is centrally concentrated with a core radius @xmath163 pc .",
    "it is also rather luminous with @xmath8 .",
    "this reinforces the notion , first put forward by @xcite , that m31 possesses a population of compact , luminous globular clusters in its outer halo that does not have a counterpart in the milky way .",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly given its extremely remote location , mgc1 does not show any evidence for a tidal limit in its outer regions , and king models do not provide a good description of the shape of the brightness profile at large radii .",
    "instead we observe a power - law fall - off with exponent @xmath11 , breaking to @xmath12 in the outermost parts .",
    "this core - halo structure , which we see extending to radii of at least @xmath9 pc and possibly as far as @xmath10 pc , is broadly in line with expectations derived from numerical modelling of isolated globular clusters . in this regard mgc1",
    "is unique in our experience ",
    "the most radially extended globular cluster in the milky way is ngc 2419 which shows a tidal cut - off at @xmath144 pc .",
    "further detailed observational study of mgc1 may therefore be extremely useful for advancing our understanding of globular cluster evolution .",
