    "studies of the supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) are essential for elucidating the details of snr evolution , nucleosynthesis , the nature and environments of supernova progenitors , and so on . as probes of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ,",
    "snrs also yield information on the energy balance and chemical composition of their environments , which serves as input to larger questions of galactic chemical evolution and the star formation history of the cloud .",
    "the relative closeness of the lmc plus its well - determined distance ( we use 50 kpc throughout ) means that accurate physical quantities can be derived for individual remnants in the galaxy .",
    "also , due to the generally low interstellar absorption toward the lmc , it is possible to detect x - rays in the important 0.52.5 kev energy band , which includes emission lines from some of the most abundant metals in the universe , such as k - shell transitions of highly - ionized atoms of oxygen , neon , magnesium , silicon and sulfur and l - shell lines of ionized iron .",
    "the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) onboard the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( ) , with its superior energy resolution compared to previous broadband x - ray spectrometers , gives us the first real opportunity for studying these issues quantitatively in the x - ray regime .",
    "mathewson et al .",
    "( 1983 , 1984 , 1985 ) identified 32 snrs in the lmc on the basis of optical , radio , and x - ray observations .",
    "the remnants range in size from 2 pc to about 100 pc , and therefore span the range of evolutionary phases , from young ejecta - dominated remnants , through middle - aged adiabatic remnants , to old remnants in the radiative phase .",
    "at least 12 of the lmc remnants are bright enough x - ray emitters ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 @xmath7 in the 0.154.5 kev band ) , that we can perform detailed spectroscopic study with .",
    "first results have already been reported from  on three small lmc remnants , n103b , 0509@xmath067.5 , and 0519@xmath069.0 ( hughes et al .",
    "1995 ) , that show strong emission lines originating from ejecta characteristic of thermonuclear supernovae , i.e. , type ia sne .",
    "for the research described herein , we observed seven middle - aged remnants , n23 , n49 , n63a , dem71 , n132d , 0453@xmath068.5 , and n49b , with  and performed detailed spectral analysis of their sis data .",
    "this is all the lmc snrs larger than 5 pc ( radius ) and brighter than @xmath8 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath7 over the soft kev x - ray band , which includes the three brightest thermal x - ray  emitting remnants in the lmc ( n132d , n63a , and n49 ) , plus four less luminous ones that cover a range of evolutionary states .",
    "previous x - ray spectroscopic studies of n49 , n63a , n132d , and n49b were reported by clark et al.(1982 ) based on solid state spectrometer ( sss ) data from the .",
    "the sss data clearly showed weak emission lines of mg , si , and s indicative of thermal emission , although the analysis , which used somewhat unphysical two - temperature collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models , left some doubt about the reliability of the derived elemental abundance values .",
    "more recently hwang et al .  (",
    "1993 ) analyzed all the available  data on n132d using a phenomenological nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) model and derived abundances of the heavy elements that were considerably lower than the solar values .",
    "both analyses suggest that the bulk of the x - ray emission from these remnants comes from swept - up ism rather than supernova ejecta and , as we show below , our  data confirm this finding .",
    "this observational fact gives us confidence that the snr abundances we measure indeed correspond to those of the ism in the lmc .",
    "the elemental abundances of the magellanic clouds are of great importance to extragalactic astronomy . as the nearest major galaxies to our own",
    ", they are well - studied and serve as the stepping stones for studies of more distant systems . in the current chemical composition of the clouds we see at least some of the material returned to the ism by stars of all types through winds and supernovae and , using models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis , we can constrain the history of star formation in these galaxies . it",
    "is well known that the clouds have undergone quite different star formation histories from the galaxy , based on their differing chemical properties ( see , for example , tsujimoto et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in the past 20 years with the advent of high quality optical and uv spectra ,",
    "the study of the chemical abundances of the lmc has made great progress .",
    "the earlier results of this era ( summarized in dufour 1984 ) showed that the metallicity of lmc  regions was significantly less than solar ; the observed oxygen abundance , for example , was only about  the solar value .",
    "more recent studies ( luck & lambert 1992 , russell & dopita 1992 , hereafter rd92 ) have , in general , tended to confirm these findings using optical spectra and detailed modeling of  regions , snrs , cepheids , and supergiant stars in the lmc .",
    "however , even though considerable effort has been expended in this area of research over the past decade , there remains considerable room for improvement .",
    "in particular , certain critical elements , such as mg and si , are not easily studied in the optical and uv bands due to a paucity of appropriate atomic transitions .",
    "the work we present here represents the first systematic attempt to measure the gas - phase lmc abundances in a new , independent manner using x - ray spectroscopy of snrs .",
    "our spectral analysis also allows us , for the first time , to derive accurate values for the temperature , ionization timescale , and intrinsic x - ray emissivity of the hot gas in lmc snrs .",
    "when combined with their physical radii , which are accurately known because of the well - established distance to the lmc , we have four independent observational constraints on the dynamical evolution .",
    "only three of these quantities are necessary to fully specify the evolutionary state according to the sedov ( 1959 ) similarity solution , so in fact the observational data result in an overconstrained system .",
    "this allows us to go beyond merely assuming the sedov solution and instead allows to actually establish whether or not the sedov model is a correct representation for the evolution of the snrs in our sample .    in the following",
    "we present our  analysis of the selected lmc snr sample . in ",
    "2 we briefly present the observational details .",
    "in contrast to the phenomenological models used in previous x - ray studies of lmc snrs , we have developed realistic self - consistent models that incorporate the dynamical evolution of remnants .",
    "section 3 provides a description of the spectral model we developed and compares our calculations to similar published ones .",
    "results of the sedov model fits , as well as considerations of the applicability of the model , are given in  4 .",
    "discussions of the derived abundances are in  5 . in  6 we examine the high energy x - ray emission ( @xmath43 kev ) of the remnant sample .",
    "we comment on individual remnants in  7 and summarize in the final section .",
    "has four identical x - ray telescopes ( xrt ) and four focal plane detectors .",
    "two of the focal plane instruments are solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis0 and sis1 ; ccd cameras ) and the other two are gas imaging spectrometers ( gis2 and gis3 ; gas scintillation proportional counters ) . a summary of the  observatory and its complement of instruments has been given by tanaka , inoue , & holt ( 1994 ) .",
    "the log of observations for our remnant sample is given in table 1 .",
    "all but one of the remnants were observed during the performance verification phase or the first guest observer cycle .",
    "the seven remnants in our sample were all found to have soft spectra ( mean electron temperatures @xmath9 kev ) , so we used only the sis data for the present spectral analysis .",
    "the sis was operated in 1-ccd faint mode for all observations .",
    "the data were corrected for dark - frame error , the echo effect , and charge - transfer inefficiency and hot and flickering pixels were removed using standard procedures .",
    "data were rejected during orbital times of high background ( south atlantic anomaly passages ) or when the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity was less than 6 gevc@xmath6 . in order to avoid contamination due to light leaks through the optical blocking filters , we excluded all data taken when the satellite viewing direction was 10@xmath10 or less from the bright rim of the earth .",
    "x - ray spectra were extracted from circular regions of radius @xmath11 centered on each snr with the exception of n49 and n49b . due to their close relative proximity ( n49 and n49b",
    "are separated on the sky by merely @xmath12 ) , the spectra of these two remnants were obtained from @xmath13 radius regions . in all cases background spectra",
    "were constructed from source - free regions in the sis field of view of the same observation .",
    "we show the background - subtracted sis0 spectra of our remnant sample in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the x - ray spectra in figure [ fig1 ] are all clearly thermal in nature , showing characteristic k - shell line emission from highly ionized atoms of oxygen , neon , magnesium , silicon , and sulfur as well as a broad blend of iron l - shell emission near 1 kev .",
    "the spectra of the different snrs are remarkably similar to each other , while they differ sharply from the young ejecta - dominated remnants which we studied in our earlier work on the lmc snrs ( hughes et al .",
    "in fact , whereas the  spectra of the ejecta - dominated snrs appear qualitatively more consistent with an abundance distribution corresponding to type ia sn ejecta , the seven remnants in the current study are more consistent with the roughly  solar abundances of the lmc .    as our first approach to a quantitative analysis of these spectra we used a phenomenological model , free from any specific dynamical model of snr evolution , for including nei effects in the spectral fitting ( hayashi et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this approach",
    "the x - ray - emitting plasma is assumed to have been shock heated some time ago @xmath14 to a constant temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the ionization timescale , which is the parameter characterizing deviations from ionization equilibrium , is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean electron density .",
    "in simple terms these parameters are determined from the data in the following manner : @xmath15 is largely constrained by the shape of the continuum emission while @xmath16 is constrained by the emission line ratios ( principally the ratio of helium - like to hydrogen - like k@xmath18 lines ) .",
    "in addition to the temperature and ionization timescale , the elemental abundances , an emission measure , and the line - of - sight absorption column density were required to completely specify the model .",
    "the code is based on the nei model from hughes & helfand ( 1985 ) ; we use the implementation described in hughes & singh ( 1994 ) .",
    "no remnant could be adequately described by a single - component nei plasma model , i.e. , with one @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all species . in particular",
    ", the degree of ionization appeared to vary from element to element .",
    "similar discrepancies of this kind were found in fits of the phenomenological nei plasma model to the  data of the young oxygen - rich snr 0102@xmath072.3 in the small magellanic cloud ( hayashi et al .",
    "we therefore modified our fits to the lmc snrs to allow for variable ionization timescales for the different elemental species displaying prominent line emission in the observed band , while at the same time retaining a single value of @xmath15 .",
    "this model provided improved fits , the results of which allowed us to estimate the quantity of x - ray  emitting plasma in the various snrs . assuming a constant density shell filling  of the entire volume , using the fitted elemental abundances ( which were all substantially less than solar , hayashi et al .",
    "1995 ) , and taking the remnant radii from mathewson et al .",
    "( 1983 ) ( see also table 2 ) , we obtained masses ranging from several tens to several hundred solar masses .",
    "clearly these are evolved remnants that have swept up a large quantity of ism .",
    "nevertheless , the apparent dependence of @xmath16 on elemental species as implied by this phenomenological nei model , makes us question its physical plausibility .",
    "taken at face value , one interpretation of the ionization timescale variation might be that the various elemental species are in spatially disjoint zones that have undergone differing thermodynamic histories . since the amount and approximate composition of the x - ray  emitting plasma are consistent with being dominated by ism material ( which should be chemically homogeneous ) , rather than sn ejecta ( which may not be ) , we are confident that this explanation can be rejected .",
    "an alternate and indeed more physically plausible explanation is that the x - ray  emitting plasma is chemically homogeneous , but contains a broad range of temperatures and ionization timescales .",
    "this situation would arise as a natural consequence of incorporating realistic models for the dynamical evolution of snrs , since our spectra are integrated over the entire x - ray emission from each remnant .",
    "apparent variation of the average value of @xmath16 with composition , for example , would then arise as a result of the strong dependence of ionization , recombination , and excitation rates , as well as other atomic physics quantities , on elemental species . in effect , each species would tend to pick out that value of @xmath16 which produces a maximum of intensity in the relevant emission lines .",
    "some support for this scenario comes from the fact that , at least for n132d , a better fit to the  data was obtained using a two component phenomenological nei model that contained emission from gas at both @xmath190.5 kev and @xmath192 kev ( hayashi 1997 ) ( see  [ n132d ] below ) .",
    "we consider the sedov ( 1959 ) similarity solution for an adiabatic blast wave expanding into a uniform , homogeneous ism as the description for the dynamical evolution of our snrs .",
    "as is well known this phase of evolution begins when the mass of swept - up ism grows to be much more than the mass of sn ejecta ( so that the ejecta are dynamically insignificant ) ( gull 1973 ) and it lasts until radiative cooling becomes important , which occurs roughly when the shock temperature drops below @xmath19@xmath20 k ( cox 1972 ) .",
    "based on our estimates of the swept - up mass from the phenomenological model fits , the seven lmc snrs in the sample are all old enough that they satisfy the first constraint and thus are likely to be in the adiabatic phase of evolution . in  [ results ] below",
    "we show that the remnants are not so old that radiative cooling has affected their dynamical evolution , and so they also satisfy the second condition .    in order to calculate the emergent nei x - ray spectrum ,",
    "the time history of the electron density and temperature throughout the model remnant is required .",
    "for this calculation we divided the remnant into a number of spherically symmetric shells spaced linearly in the nondimensional variable @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the velocity and radial position of a specific shell , respectively , and @xmath14 is the remnant s age .",
    "this choice of integration variable ensures a fine spacing near the shock front where the emission measure of the remnant is the largest and the time variation of the relevant quantities is the most rapid . for simplicity , the time integration was constrained so that on successive time steps a single new spatial shell was shock heated and incorporated into the remnant .",
    "consequently the more finely the remnant was divided spatially , the shorter was the time step . based on some trial studies with the  spectrum of n132d",
    ", it was found that 30 shells provided an optimal compromise between execution speed and calculational accuracy and so this value was adopted for the analysis .",
    "the temperature and density of each interior shell at each time step was determined from the analytical expression for the interior variation of these quantities ( sedov 1959 ) .",
    "it was assumed that the composition was spatially uniform and that hydrogen and helium were fully ionized .",
    "the mean molecular weight per particle was also assumed constant across the remnant , which is a good approximation for the low metallicity environment of the lmc , where the gas is dominated by hydrogen and helium .    with the time dependence of the electron density and temperature",
    "now fully specified , the ionization rate equations were integrated using the matrix diagonalization method ( e.g. , masai 1984 ; hughes & helfand 1985 ) to determine the final ( observed ) ionization state as a function of position .",
    "then the radial run of temperature , coupled with the ionization state , was used to calculate the total emergent x - ray spectrum summed over the entire model snr .",
    "we used the ionization and recombination rate coefficients and the x - ray emission code of masai ( 1984 ) .",
    "the unshocked ism was assumed to be in ionization equilibrium at a temperature of @xmath24 k , but the final results are very insensistive to the precise value of this quantity .",
    "again experiments with the spectrum of n132d found no significant difference in the best - fit parameters when the temperature defining the initial equilibrium ionization fractions was varied from @xmath25 k to @xmath20 k. this is because ionization of the first few ion states proceeds very rapidly ; most of the time is spent in the helium- and hydrogen - like ionic stages for the medium @xmath26 atomic species that are important in our analysis ( i.e. , the abundant elements from oxygen to sulfur , see below ) .",
    "emission from thirteen elements ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni ) is included in our model .",
    "the abundances of helium and carbon can not be determined from our data since there are no significant emission lines from these species in the  x - ray band .",
    "furthermore , we found that the abundances of nitrogen , argon , calcium , and nickel were not well constrained by the data .",
    "consequently we fixed the abundances of these elements to the lmc values determined by rd92 : he 10.94 , c 8.04 , n 7.14 , ar 6.29 , ca 5.89 , and ni 6.04 , where we quote values on a scale of @xmath27 .",
    "the baseline abundances we assume for the other species are o 8.82 , ne 7.92 , mg 7.42 , si 7.52 , s 7.2 , and fe 7.6 , which are the cosmic values from allen ( 1973 ) .",
    "the precise values of the carbon , nitrogen , argon , calcium , and nickel abundances have virtually no effect on our measurements of the other elemental abundances , unless the listed species are extremely overabundant relative to solar , which is unlikely , again given the low metallicity of the lmc .",
    "the helium abundance does have some impact on the absolute values of our derived abundances , since a significant fraction of the continuum emission ( roughly 30% at 1 kev ) is provided by helium . roughly speaking a 10% increase ( decrease ) in the helium abundance",
    "translates into a 5 - 10% increase ( decrease ) in the derived abundances of the other elements . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative abundance values we derive are affected to a much lesser extent by changes in the helium abundance .",
    "the parameters of the model are the shock temperature ( @xmath28 ) , the ionization timescale ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the preshock ism number density of hydrogen atoms and @xmath31 is the ionization age of the remnant ) , the abundances of the elements listed above , and a normalization factor ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the angular radius and distance of the remnant , respectively ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constrained by the data in the same manner as described above for the phenomenological nei model and the normalization factor is essentially determined from the x - ray flux .",
    "when the radius of each remnant is included , we have four independent observational constraints on the three independent parameters of the sedov model , namely age , ambient ism density , and initial explosion energy .",
    "this overconstrained system allows us to carry out an internal check on whether or not the sedov solution is a correct description of the snrs in our sample . in effect",
    "what we do is to explore the consistency between the age derived from the dynamics of the sedov model ( which depends on @xmath28 and @xmath33 ) and that derived from the fitted ionization timescale ( converted to an age using @xmath30 derived from the normalization factor ) .",
    "one complication is that none of the remnants in our sample displays the ideal , spherical symmetry expected of the sedov model , so an additional multiplicative factor is needed to account for the fraction of volume within the radius of the remnant that is filled with x - ray emitting gas when the fitted normalization factor is converted to a mean density .",
    "the last parameter in the spectral fits is the line - of - sight absorbing column density @xmath35 .",
    "we use the cross sections of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "the precise relationship between the amount of energy imparted to ions and electrons at supernova shock fronts is still one of the major unsolved issues in the physics of strong collisionless shocks ( shklovsky 1968 ) .",
    "whether the electrons attain the same mean thermal velocity behind the shock front as the ions , in which case they will have a considerably lower temperature , or very rapidly equilibrate with the ions , as proposed by mckee ( 1974 ) , is still not entirely clear .",
    "therefore we have constructed two classes of models that encompass the plausible extremes of these possible situations .",
    "the first is a full equilibration model , where the electron and ion temperatures are assumed to be equal .",
    "the other model assumes that the electrons and ions attain the same mean thermal velocity at the shock and then share energy solely through coulomb collisions ( see spitzer 1978 ) and that , consequently , the electron temperature lags the ion temperature ( see , for example , itoh 1978 ; cox & anderson 1982 ) .",
    "however , as it turns out for our sample of lmc remnants , with the possible exception of the ionization timescale , the fitted parameters do not depend strongly on which model is assumed and , in particular , the derived abundances are almost the same in the two models .    as part of our model verification we computed a number of simple diagnostic quantities and compared our results with those from the similar sedov - phase nei models of hamilton , sarazin , & chevalier ( 1983 ) .",
    "we found reasonable agreement ( within a factor @xmath36 ) between the two models for the continuum flux at 2 kev , the he - like k@xmath18 line flux , the fe - l line flux , and the x - ray luminosity above 0.1 kev .",
    "our model gives a slightly higher ionization state than the hamilton et al .",
    "model , which is most likely due to the difference in the rate coefficients used by the models .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we show the sis spectra and the best - fit nei spectral models for all the remnants in our sample .",
    "sedov models assuming full electron - ion temperature equilibration are plotted ; the other set of models assuming coulomb temperature equilibration would be indistinguishable from these . for display purposes only we averaged the sis0 and sis1 data and corresponding best - fit spectral models . for the actual analysis , in all cases but one , both the sis0 and sis1 spectra were fitted jointly .",
    "the one exception is n63a , where there was a pronounced gain discrepancy for the sis1 data . rather than introducing an _ ad hoc",
    "_ gain correction we decided to use only the sis0 data for this snr . because of its high flux and reasonably long exposure ( see table 1 ) , n63a has the best statistics of any remnant in the sample and so the loss of the sis1 data does not seriously impede our ability to determine its spectral parameters . in all cases",
    "the sis data were rebinned so that each spectral channel contained at least 20 counts after background subtraction .",
    "this allows us to use @xmath37 as the figure - of - merit function for assessing goodness of fit and determining best fit quantities and confidence levels . in table 2",
    ", we give the best - fit values and 90% confidence level statistical uncertainties for the spectral parameters and elemental abundances for both the full equilibration model and the model assuming energy exchange between electron and ions through coulomb collisions .    from a statistical point of view , the reduced @xmath37 values given in table 2 are formally unacceptable .",
    "however , systematic errors in the experimental data due to calibration uncertainties , for example , have not been included , nor have we included uncertainties due to the atomic physics or the incompleteness of the x - ray line lists used in the spectral models .",
    "this last point is particularly important since the pattern of residuals for all the snrs show significant excesses at photon energies of @xmath190.9 kev and @xmath191.2 kev which are due to missing fe l - shell lines in the models . as a representation of the  data",
    ", however , the sedov model does a considerably better job than the phenomenological nei model discussed above (  [ phenomenological ] ) , which was specifically introduced in order to merely reproduce the observed  spectra with little astrophysical motivation .",
    "although the phenomenological model requires a larger number of free parameters , the sedov model provides fits with comparable or even better quality . given our present state of knowledge of the instrumental calibration and the atomic physics of x - ray spectral line emission , we believe that the sedov model describes the  spectra about as well as can be expected .",
    "our fitted column densities from the  spectra agree quite well with estimates of the total column toward each remnant based on the gas in the galaxy ( heiles & cleary 1979 ) and in the lmc ( mcgee & milton 1966 ) .",
    "in particular , the total column of gas is greatest toward n49 , n63a , and n49b ( values of @xmath19@xmath38 atoms @xmath7 ) and is least toward n23 , dem71 , n132d , and 0453@xmath068.5 ( values of @xmath19@xmath39 atoms @xmath7 ) , which correlates quite well with the x - ray results . the quantity of absorbing gas in the galaxy along the line - of - sight to the lmc sets the minimum column density we should expect to see .",
    "this is @xmath40 atoms @xmath7 , which appears to be consistent with the columns derived for dem71 , n23 , and perhaps 0453@xmath068.5 .",
    "the reader will notice that both the fitted shock temperature and ionization timescale are consistently higher for the coulomb equilibration timescales model compared to the full equilibration one , as a direct consequence of the lag of the electron temperature with respect to the ion temperature in the former case .",
    "however , the difference in temperature is small , @xmath4130% , and comparable to the statistical uncertainty in the parameters .",
    "the ionization timescale differs by a much larger amount , up to factors of @xmath193 , the consequences of which we discuss below when we compare the ionization and dynamical ages .",
    "the other fitted parameters , i.e. , column density , normalization and the elemental abundances , also agree to within the statistical errors . we note that the quality of the fits as indicated by the reduced @xmath37 values is nearly the same under the two different assumptions we have made about electron - ion equilibration timescales , which is unfortunate since it means that our study can not use this to discriminate between the two cases .    from the fitted normalization of the x - ray spectra ( @xmath42 ) and shock temperature ( @xmath43 )",
    ", we estimate the ism number density of hydrogen ( @xmath30 ) , the sedov dynamical age ( @xmath44 ) , the initial explosion energy ( @xmath45 ) , and the swept - up mass ( @xmath46 ) , using the following equations :    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the solid angle subtended by the remnant shell with respect to the remnant center , and is a factor that is intended to take account of possible incompleteness of the spherical structure .",
    "spherical symmetry ( @xmath52 ) was assumed in order to compute the values of the derived quantities given in table 2 .",
    "the physical radii in table 2 are based on the angular x - ray size from mathewson et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and our assumed distance of 50 kpc to the lmc .",
    "in calculating the swept - up mass we assumed that the mean ionic weight was @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] plots the ambient ism hydrogen number density and derived explosion energy versus radius for the several remnants .",
    "the ambient density is uncorrelated with remnant size for our sample .",
    "there are some potential biases which work against finding snrs in the upper right corner of this figure ( radiative cooling ) or the lower left ( rapid expansion ) , but given the lack of a statistically significant correlation , these issues are moot .",
    "the range of derived @xmath54 values vary over an order of magnitude from a high of @xmath55 erg for n132d to a low of @xmath56 erg for n23 . recall that @xmath54 depends on @xmath57 and that we assumed the maximum value for @xmath51 ( @xmath58 , i.e. , spherical symmetry )",
    ", so the explosion energies we quote are in some sense lower bounds . in particular , n23 , which has the lowest derived @xmath54 value , also is the remnant that has the most asymmetric x - ray image .",
    "uncertainty in the distance to individual snrs due to the thickness of the lmc , for example , is probably not much more than 10% , which translates to a @xmath1925% error in @xmath54 . as for the ambient density ,",
    "we find no statistically significant evidence for a dependence of the derived explosion energy on remnant size .",
    "this is in contrast to optical studies of lmc snrs ( dopita 1979 , danziger & leibowitz 1985 ) that have claimed a rather strong dependence of @xmath54 on remnant size , even for some of the same remnants as in our sample .",
    "these results were never particularly convincing ( at least to us ) since they were based on extrapolating the pressure behind the shock , as estimated from the density - sensitive [ ] lines , to estimate the energy density in the interior of the entire remnant .",
    "blair , kirshner , & chevalier ( 1981 ) have pointed out that the apparent relation between @xmath54 and radius could be explained if the [ ] emitting regions are dominated by magnetic pressure , rather than thermal pressure as assumed otherwise .",
    "our explosion energy values are based on the well constrained observables of shock temperature , radius , and emission measure , and rely on the applicability of the sedov evolutionary model .",
    "whether or not this is justified is the next issue we consider .",
    "one of the assumptions of sedov - phase remnant models is that they are adiabatic , or energy conserving , which implies that radiative cooling is insignificant .",
    "cox ( 1972 ) identified a number of evolutionary phases in the life of an snr as it makes the transition from an adiabatic remnant to a fully radiative one . in his picture , the onset of radiative cooling occurs when the temperature distribution begins to deviate from the adiabatic model ( temperature sag phase ) at an age given by @xmath59 where the cooling coefficient @xmath60 is of order @xmath61 . using @xmath54 and @xmath62 from table 2 , @xmath63 varies from @xmath64 yr for n63a to @xmath65 yr for 0453@xmath068.5 .",
    "for all the remnants in our sample , @xmath63 is at least 50% larger than the dynamical age quoted in table 2 showing that , at least from this point of view , the sedov model is justified .    as we mentioned in ",
    "[ sedovmodel ] , we can estimate the ionization age ( @xmath31 ) of our remnant sample from the fitted @xmath29 values , by employing the @xmath30 value derived from the emission measure ( eqn .",
    "because of the difference in fitted ionization timescales between the full and coulomb temperature equilibration models , there is a significant difference in the inferred ionization ages as well . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot the correlation between ionization age ( for both models ) and dynamical age . for all remnants",
    ", the full equilibration model predicts an ionization age that is considerably lower than the dynamical age with differences ranging from @xmath191.3@xmath66 ( for 0453@xmath068.5 ) to @xmath199@xmath66 ( for n49b ) . on the other hand , under the assumption of coulomb equilibration timescales there is excellent agreement ( a difference of @xmath411.2@xmath66 ) between the ionization and dynamical ages for n23 , n49 , dem71 , and 0453@xmath068.5 although the ionization ages of n132d , n63a , and n49b all continue to remain low .",
    "this discrepancy for the latter three remnants can not be resolved by invoking clumping of the x - ray emitting gas , since that would increase our estimate for @xmath30 and consequently lower the inferred ionization ages even further .",
    "similarly , reducing @xmath51 from its spherically symmetric value of @xmath67 would also result in reduction of the ionization ages as well .",
    "we believe that the most likely reason for the discrepancy is that the sedov model has overestimated the dynamical ages of these remnants .",
    "in this case , it is not coincidental that the three remnants with significant differences between their ionization and dynamical ages are also the remnants with unusually high inferred values of initial sn explosion energy : @xmath4@xmath68 erg .",
    "a plausible explanation for both discrepancies is that these remnants exploded within preexisiting low - density cavities in the ism .",
    "the low interior density allows the sn blast wave to propagate rapidly to the cavity wall , where it then encounters denser gas , begins to slow down , and emits copious amounts of x - rays .",
    "this scenario naturally results in a reduction of both the dynamical age and the initial explosion energy from that inferred assuming the sedov model .",
    "note that hughes ( 1987 ) proposed precisely this same model to account for the difference between the sedov dynamical age and the kinematic age determined from the expansion of high velocity oxygen - rich filaments in n132d ( more on this in  [ n132d ] below ) .",
    "it is encouraging that our independent estimate of n132d s age based on its ionization timescale confirms this earlier result and it gives us confidence in the identification of n63a and n49b as two more examples of this phenomenon in the lmc .",
    "this turns out to be extremely important , since it allows us to identify these three remnants as the core - collapse supernovae of massive stars whose strong stellar winds modified the surrounding ism .",
    "the four other snrs , n23 , n49 , dem71 , and 0453@xmath068.5 , are fully consistent with the sedov model under the assumption that the electrons and ions do not attain the same temperature at the shock front , but rather exchange energy slowly through coulomb collisions .",
    "this hypothesis appears to be supported by other observations of snrs ; perhaps the best evidence to date comes from the remnant of sn1006 in the galaxy .",
    "based on comparing shock models to the observed far - uv emission lines of the remnant , laming et al.(1996 ) find that the electrons at the shock front in sn1006 can attain a temperature of no more than @xmath1920% of the ion temperature and that even lower equilibration values are prefered by their data .",
    "this is the strongest observational evidence in the literature against full electron - ion equilibration at sn shock fronts .",
    "we close this section by noting that the consistency of these four snrs with the sedov model appears to extend even to the value we find for their average initial explosion energy @xmath69 erg , where the uncertainty comes from the rms object - to - object scatter .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] displays the complete set of abundance results for the seven lmc remnants , where we have chosen to average the fitted abundances ( and errors ) that come from our two different assumptions about the timescale for electron - ion temperature equilibration .",
    "overall , we find abundances that are less than cosmic by factors of 2 to 5 , as expected for interstellar gas in the lmc . at first glance",
    "the different remnants yield rather similar abundances for the same elemental species , but a closer look reveals some notable exceptions that we discuss further below .    in order to check for systematic effects that might have biased the fitted abundances we carried out the following correlation analysis .",
    "first we determined the mean metallicity for each remnant by calculating the error - weighted average of the fitted abundance values ( presented in the bottom half of table 2 ) , including both sets of values from the full and coulomb equilibration models .",
    "we searched for correlations between these mean metallicities and the various fitted or derived parameters using the spearman rank - order test .",
    "the correlation coefficents ( @xmath70 ) for mean metallicity versus @xmath35 , @xmath43 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are @xmath73 , 0.04 , 0.61 , and 0.21 , respectively , although none of the correlations were statistically significant ( among these the highest significance was @xmath1993% for metallicity versus @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is very encouraging since it shows that there are no obvious systematic biases in the derived abundances that are directly linked to the spectral fits .",
    "likewise there are no statistically significant correlations between mean metallicity and any of the derived parameters @xmath54 , @xmath62 , and @xmath46 .",
    "there are , however , two statistically significant correlations : mean metallicity versus age ( @xmath74 , significance @xmath1999.6% ) and and mean metallicity versus radius ( @xmath75 , significance @xmath1999.97% ) . plots of these latter two correlations , plus the correlation of metallicity versus swept - up mass , are shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the error bars displayed are estimates based on the weighted rms scatter from the individual abundance measurements of the six species considered .",
    "the correlation in the left panel of figure [ fig5 ] shows that the smaller remnants are somewhat enhanced in metallicity with respect to the larger ones .",
    "in fact , this correlation also holds when the elemental species are considered individually .",
    "specifically , the oxygen , neon , silicon , and iron abundances show correlations with radius that are significant at the 99.97% , 94% , 96% and 95% confidence levels , respectively , while the magnesium and sulfur abundances are essentially uncorrelated with remnant size .",
    "note that these correlations can be seen in figure [ fig4 ] since the data points corresponding to the individual remnants are plotted for each species from left to right in order of remnant size .",
    "regions in the lmc are known to show a significant correlation between distance from the galaxy center and their oxygen abundance based on measurements of [ ] and [ ] from warm photoioinized gas .",
    "the abundance gradient has a value of @xmath76 dex / kpc ( kobulnicky 1997 ) .",
    "we determined the deprojected radial distances of our remnants from the center of the lmc assuming a flat disk geometry , an inclination angle of 27@xmath77 between the normal to the disk and the line - of - sight , position angle of 165@xmath77 , and center at 5@xmath7824@xmath79 , @xmath069@xmath7748@xmath80 .",
    "the remnants in our sample cover galactocentric radial distances from 0.3 kpc to 3.3 kpc , which would suggest a 30% difference in abundance based on the  regions .",
    "in fact , the mean metallicity is uncorrelated with distance from the center of the lmc and our data are best described by a model with no gradient in chemical abundance with galactocentric distance .",
    "the interpretation we favor is that the metallicity - radius correlation indicates the presence of newly produced sn ejecta in at least some of the remnants of the sample .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , since we know that small , young galactic remnants like tycho and cas a show very strong and prominent x - ray emission from supernova ejecta , while larger ones , like the cygnus loop and vela , do nt .",
    "furthermore , earlier work by us ( hughes et al .",
    "1995 ) on the  x - ray spectra of the three lmc snrs n103b , 0509@xmath067.5 , and 0519@xmath069.0 ( with radii between 3 and 4 pc ) revealed them to be dominanted by ejecta .",
    "it is perhaps a little surprising that the correlation is so good with radius or age but not with swept - up mass .",
    "apropos to this point is the observation that the only remnant out of these seven previously known to contain newly minted sn ejecta is n132d , which has the largest swept - up mass in our sample !",
    "clearly the fate of the metals ejected by a sn is complex , which makes prediction of their emission properties as a function of time rather difficult .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of our work here and we direct the interested reader to tenorio - tagle ( 1996 ) , where a discussion of some of the relevant issues for type ii supernovae is given .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] puts the level of enrichment ( i.e. , the difference between the average metallicity of the smaller snrs compared to the larger ones ) at a value of @xmath190.1 .",
    "interestingly , this difference is comparable to the amount of metals that models predict should be produced and ejected by certain mass ranges of progenitor stars . for example if we take the nucleosynthetic yields for a progenitor with a main - sequence mass of 13 @xmath81 from thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto ( 1996 ) and dilute it with 200 @xmath81 of swept - up material ( the median value in our sample ) , then the fractional abundances of o , ne , and mg would increase by @xmath190.1 . in the same way the abundances of si , s , and fe would increase by an amount equal to @xmath190.4 .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields of the lighter elements , in particular , are a strong function of main sequence mass and , thus , diluting the ejecta from a 25 @xmath81 progenitor with 200 @xmath81 of ism would result in the o abundance increasing by @xmath191 .",
    "the preceding points are intended to indicate the order of magnitude agreement between the amount of enrichment we actually see in the lmc snr sample and the amount that might be expected in the very simplest scenario imaginable for the mixing of ejecta and ism in snrs .",
    "in addition to this statistical evidence for ejecta enrichment , there is direct evidence as well . in particular , we refer the reader to figure [ fig4 ] where the anomalously high iron abundance for dem71 can be clearly seen .",
    "although some other individual abundances are slightly discrepant with respect to their neighbors ( e.g. , the magnesium abundance for n49b ) , only the case of the iron abundance of dem71 is statistically significant .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below (  [ dem71 ] ) .",
    "another question concerning our abundance measurements that must be addressed is the possible depletion of metals onto dust grains in the interstellar medium .",
    "interstellar gas is believed to be significantly depleted in magnesium , silicon , calcium , and iron ( with abundances roughly an order of magnitude less than solar ) , but only slightly depleted in oxygen and sulfur .",
    "depletions depend on the mean gas density of the environment , in general , growing larger with increasing gas density ( mathis 1990 ) .",
    "an important constraint is that neon and argon , as inert , noble gases , are not expected to form grains and thus should not be depleted in the gas - phase .",
    "our abundance results appear to be in conflict with this picture of the dusty ism .",
    "in fact , the abundance we find for neon is essentially the same as that of magnesium , silicon , and sulfur , while oxygen and iron are no more than about a factor of two less .",
    "vancura et al .  (",
    "1994 ) study the effects of interstellar grains on the predicted x - ray and ir emission of supernova shock waves and find that the x - ray spectra of snrs are substantially influenced by the gradual destruction of dust grains , primarily through collisions with protons and he nuclei , in the post - shock flow .",
    "their models are based on a planar shock geometry and do not include the deceleration of the blast wave , so their results are not directly applicable to our measurements . nevertheless , with this as a warning we attempt a comparison .",
    "the fraction of initial mass remaining in grains is a strong function of the swept - up column density behind the shock . as an estimate of the swept - up column for our remnants we use the quantity @xmath82 , which simply assumes that the entire mass of shocked gas in the snr is contained in a uniform density shell of thickness @xmath83 and takes the average value of the swept - up column at the inner and outer edges of the shell .",
    "the smallest value of this quantity among the remnants in our sample is @xmath84 @xmath7 ( for 0453@xmath068.5 ) while the largest is @xmath85 @xmath7 ( for n63a ) .",
    "according to figure 3 in vancura et al .",
    "( 1994 ) the fraction of initial mass that should have remained in grains is 60% for our minimum swept - up column and 20% for the maximum one . for the species magnesium , silicon , and iron , which are supposed to be nearly entirely depleted in the gas - phase ,",
    "then the mean abundances should vary by about a factor of 2.4 over this range in swept - up column .",
    "we just do nt see such large variations in the abundances of these elements as a function of swept - up column density .",
    "furthermore , there is not even a significant correlation between swept - up column and abundance for magnesium and iron , although the correlation for the silcon abundance versus swept - up column density is significant at the 97.4% confidence level .",
    "weighing all the evidence presented in this and the preceding paragraph leads us to conclude that we have not detected evidence for the destruction of swept - up interstellar dust grains on the expected timescales in these lmc snrs .",
    "this suggests that either the gas - phase of the ism is not significantly depleted in metals or the timescale for the destruction of dust grains behind sn shock waves is shorter than previously thought .",
    "we determine the gas - phase abundances of the lmc by averaging , for each elemental species , the fitted abundances from the seven remnants . as before we include both sets of values corresponding to the full and coulomb equilibration models .",
    "the uncertainties quoted come from the weighted rms scatter among the 14 measurements . for sulfur ,",
    "the values from 0453@xmath068.5 and n49b are not included , since these snrs provided only upper limits .",
    "table 3 lists the average abundances and uncertainties expressed as @xmath86 = 12 + \\log ( { \\rm m / h})$ ] and figure [ fig6 ] plots the abundances , relative to the cosmic values we assumed , versus elemental species .",
    "the third column of table 3 lists the lmc chemical abundances of oxygen , neon , and sulfur determined from uv / optical spectra of   regions as summarized in a review by dufour ( 1984 ) .",
    "the agreement between the x - ray snrs and  regions for the different elements is impressive .",
    "more recently , rd92 presented the results of a large study to establish a consistent set of global abundances for the large and small magellanic clouds covering the elements from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "this work was based on spectral analyses of f supergiants for the abundances of the heavier elements ( e.g. , mg , si , and elements with @xmath89 ) ( russell & bessell 1989 ) and the modelling of spectra from  regions and snrs for the lower @xmath26 elements ( e.g. , he , o , ne , and s ) ( russell & dopita 1990 ) . our values and the ones from rd92 are also in general agreement with the possible exception of magnesium and silicon , where the rd92 values appear anomalously high compared to the other species , although it should be noted that the abundance of silicon was quoted in rd92 as being highly uncertain .",
    "it is now clear that these species are not anomalously abundant in the ism of the lmc compared to , say , neon and sulfur .",
    "thus the results from x - ray snrs have proved to be especially valuable in filling this important gap in our knowledge of the abundances of the intermediate mass elements and in providing a set of accurate abundance values determined in a consistent manner for elemental species over a broad range of atomic number .",
    "now a few statements about the reliability of our abundance estimates .",
    "the abundances of neon , magnesium , silicon , and sulfur that we derive from the  x - ray spectra of snrs are least subject to systematic uncertainty since they come from fits to k - shell emission lines of well understood helium - like and hydrogen - like ionic species .",
    "our iron abundance is based on the l - shell blend at @xmath191 kev , so there is some systematic uncertainty due to inadequate or poorly known atomic physics and the incompleteness of the line lists used in the spectral models .",
    "our oxygen abundance is also somewhat less reliable because the oxygen k - shell lines are near the low energy cutoff of the sis detectors where the efficiency is low and the calibration is less certain .",
    "furthermore , of all the species considered , the oxygen abundance is most sensitive to the precise variation of temperature and ionization through the interior of our sedov models .",
    "for example , over the outer 10% radius of the sedov models ( from which nearly all of the x - ray emission comes ) , the ionization fraction of o viii ( hydrogen - like ) varies by more than an order of magnitude ( decreasing from the edge in toward the center ) . by contract ,",
    "si xiv ( also hydrogen - like ) is the dominant ionic species and varies by less than a factor of 2 over the same radial range .",
    "thus , our models predict that the oxygen emission should be coming from a narrow shell near the edge of the snr , while the silicon emission should be distributed over a larger radial extent .",
    "future higher spatial resolution x - ray observations with  will be able to measure these variations and thereby provide more accurate abundance results that are less dependent on the model details .",
    "however , the comparison between our results and previous ones shown in figure [ fig6 ] suggests that the systematic error in the oxygen and iron abundances derived from our work is not much more than @xmath19 0.10.2 , with our values being slightly lower than the optical / uv ones .",
    "x - ray imaging at energies above @xmath194 kev has been one of the most important recent developments in the search for pulsar - powered synchrotron nebulae ( psn ) in supernova remnants .",
    "studies with in the past 2 years have confirmed the existence of , or directly detected , psn in several galactic snrs including kes 73 ( blanton & helfand 1996 ) , g11.2@xmath00.3 ( vasisht et al .  1996 ) , w44 ( harrus , hughes , & helfand 1996 ) , cta-1 ( slane et al .",
    "1997 ) , and msh 11 - 6_2 _ ( harrus , hughes , & slane 1998 ) .",
    "the reason for this is simple : above 4 kev thermal emission from shock - heated gas is negligible , while hard power - law emission from a psn remains relatively strong .",
    "the discovery of a psn in a supernova remnant is pivotal , since it conclusively establishes the remnant as the product of a massive - star core - collapse sne .",
    "the only lmc snrs that can , without question , be put in this class are the snrs 0540@xmath069.3 and n157b both of which contain rapidly rotating pulsars with periods of 50.3 ms ( seward , harnden , & helfand 1984 ) and 16.1 ms ( marshall et al .",
    "1998 ) , respectively , and whose x - ray emissions are dominated by the nonthermal power - law from the psn . because of the known distance to the lmc , these psn have well - determined soft ( 0.154.5 kev ) x - ray luminosities of @xmath90 ( 0540@xmath069.3 ) and @xmath91 ( n157b ) .",
    "a factor of @xmath922500 separates the luminosity of 0540@xmath069.3 from that of the faintest known galactic psn which surrounds psr b1853 + 01 in w44 .",
    "it is quite possible that psn with luminosities in this range are present in some of the lmc snrs in our sample even though all are clearly dominated by thermal emission .",
    "however the arcmin imaging capability of , which is adequate for spatially resolving thermal and nonthermal emission in galactic snrs , is insufficient for doing so for lmc snrs , where a 2 pc diameter psn would subtend merely 8@xmath93 .",
    "thus any information on psn from  will have to come from the integrated spectra of individual lmc remnants . at this time we do not claim unambiguous detection of nonthermal x - ray emission for any of the 7 snrs in this study , because the sis emission observed above @xmath193 kev is comparable to the fluctuations in background .    in order to set quantitative limits , we fitted the high energy portion of the sis spectra to a power - law model ( @xmath94 ) with a fixed photon index of @xmath95 .",
    "for the four fainter snrs ( n23 , dem71 , 0453@xmath068.5 , and n49b ) the band fitted was 310 kev , while for the brighter ones ( n49 , n63a , and n132d ) we used the 410 kev band .",
    "acceptable fits were obtained in all cases .",
    "the 3-@xmath66 upper limits to the flux of this component were then used to calculate unabsorbed luminosities in the soft x - ray band as shown in table 4 .",
    "these luminosity values are in the range expected for psn ( seward & wang 1988 ) . the high limit for n63a is rather interesting since this is one of the remnants , along with n132d and n49b , that is likely to have arisen from a core - collapse supernova and therefore might be expected to contain a psn .",
    "note that the high upper limit value for n132d largely reflects the short  exposure on the remnant .",
    "the limits we set for the others are consistent with them _ not _ containing rapidly spinning young pulsars , in agreement with our age estimates assuming sedov evolution .",
    "current theories predict that type ia sne should not produce pulsars , so their remnants should not contain psn .",
    "it is possible that these snrs may show nonthermal x - ray emission from electrons accelerated to high energies at the shock front by the first - order fermi process as observed in sn1006 ( koyama et al .",
    "this emission tends to be steeper spectrum ( @xmath96 to @xmath97 ) and fainter ( sn1006 s soft @xmath98 is @xmath19@xmath99 erg s@xmath6 ) than that of psn and therefore much more difficult to detect in lmc snrs .",
    "the upper limit to the high energy luminosity for dem71 , which is the only securely identified remnant of a type ia sn in the sample , is about an order of magnitude higher than sn1006 s luminosity .",
    "n23 is not a particularly well studied remnant .",
    "chu & kennicutt ( 1988 , hereafter ck88 ) tentatively classify it as the remnant of a massive star sne ( pop i ) based on the high density of ob stars nearby and its proximity to a modest molecular cloud ( cohen et al .",

    "the remnant is brightest in the southeast and trails off in brightness toward the northwest . on smaller scales , however , individual features differ in relative brightness across the electromagnetic spectrum .",

    "two of the three lobes consist of shock - heated gas while the third is a photoionized region .",
    "the shock - heated gas appears to be of normal composition for the lmc and is expanding at moderate velocities , @xmath19250 km s@xmath6 ( shull 1983 ) . in the radio band n63a",
    "shows a thick asymmetric shell - like structure @xmath1965@xmath93 in diameter with enhancements at the positions of the bright optical features ( dickel et al .",
    "the x - ray image ( mathewson et al .  1983 ) also displays a thick shell of roughly the same size as the radio one but without any obvious enhancements corresponding to features at the other wavelengths .",
    "curiously , the bright optical region is only about the size of the x - ray or radio shells and is displaced westward by about 15@xmath93 from their respective centers .    based on its location in an  region , as well as its positional coincidence with the ob association ngc 2030 , it is not surprising that this remnant is considered to have had a pop i progenitor ( ck88 ) .",
    "this could also be consistent with our suggestion that n63a exploded within a wind - blown cavity in the ism .",
    "we derive the highest ambient ism density for this remnant , nearly 4 @xmath103 , yet other signs of such a high density environment are not obvious .",
    "for example , unlike both n49 and n132d , there is no evidence for molecular emission near n63a from either the columbia survey of the lmc ( cohen et al .",
    "1988 ) or from higher angular resolution sest data ( israel et al .",
    "it is clear that a lot more work will be needed before we obtain a comprehensive picture of this enigmatic snr and its environment .",
    "there is a class of snrs that show only hydrogen lines in their optical spectra with virtually no emission from collisionally excited forbidden lines , e.g. , [ ] and [ ] , as usually seen from snrs .",
    "tycho s remnant and sn1006 , believed to be from type ia sne , are examples of such so - called balmer - dominated snrs in the galaxy .",
    "there are also four such remnants in the lmc ( tuohy et al .  1982 ) .",
    "two of them , 0509@xmath067.5 , and 0519@xmath069.0 , show strong x - ray emission lines of the metals si , s , ar , ca , and fe ( hughes et al .  1995 ) , which are known to be characteristic of type ia supernova ejecta .",
    "the young inferred ages of these snrs ( @xmath41 1500 yr ) are consistent with the ejecta - dominated nature of their x - ray emission .",
    "dem71 is another lmc balmer - dominated snr that is older and more evolved than the two just discussed .",
    "based on its age , size , and the estimated amount of gas swept - up by the blast wave ( see table 2 ) , dem71 is believed to be in a transition state in which the x - ray emission is changing from being dominated by sn ejecta to being dominated by swept - up interstellar gas . ( the fourth lmc example of this class , 0548@xmath070.4 , is a much weaker x - ray source and is not in the current  sample , so it will not be discussed further . )",
    "the balmer - dominated optical spectra can be interpreted rather well in the context of a model in which a high - velocity interstellar shock overtakes at least partially neutral interstellar gas ( chevalier & raymond 1978 ) .",
    "when examined in detail the h@xmath18 line from these remnants shows a distinctive two - component line profile , consisting of narrow and broad components .",
    "the width of the broad component provides a nearly direct measurement of the shock velocity . for dem71 , smith et al .",
    "( 1991 ) determined a probable range for the shock velocity of 300800 km s@xmath6 , corresponding to shock temperatures of 0.110.76 kev .",
    "this range is in very good agreeement with our x - ray - derived value of @xmath111 kev .",
    "it is now reasonably secure that balmer - dominated snrs are the remnants of type ia sne . in light of this point",
    "it is very interesting that dem71 is the only remnant in the current  sample that shows direct evidence for enhanced abundances .",
    "as clearly shown in figure [ fig4 ] the iron abundance of dem71 is about a factor of 2 higher than all the others in the sample .",
    "this corresponds to an amount of `` extra '' iron present in dem71 of roughly @xmath112 , which is about 10% of the total amount of iron believed to be ejected by a ia supernovae ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ) .",
    "this discovery provides further support for a causal connection between balmer - dominated snrs and type ia sne and it highlights the important of such objects for understanding the chemical enrichment of the ism .",
    "follow - up observations with  and searches for coronal [ ] @xmath1135303 emission are planned in order to determine the spatial distribution of the excess iron in dem71 and to search for other elemental species that might be enhanced .",
    "n132d is the one of the brightest lmc remnants and is probably the best studied of them all .",
    "its popularity with optical observers is due in part to the fact that it contains high - velocity oxygen - rich ejecta that identifies the remnant as having come from the core - collapse sn of a massive star .",
    "this ejecta lies near the geometric center of the remnant and is surrounded by a larger limb - brightened shell of material with normal lmc abundances ( see references in morse , winkler , & kirshner 1995 ) .",
    "these two components also appear , more or less , in the radio ( dickel & milne 1995 ) and the x - ray ( hughes 1987 ) images of n132d , although individual features when examined in detail do vary with wavelength .",
    "it is not known if the x - ray emitting features near the center of the remnant are oxygen - rich .",
    "one clue , suggesting that they may not be enhanced , was first presented by blair , raymond , & long ( 1994 ) who noted that the x - ray peaks near the center were generally associated with low - velocity , normal composition , optical filaments , rather than with high - velocity oxygen - rich ones .",
    "observations of n132d ( morse et al .  1996 ) provide a clear confirmation of this effect .",
    "the high - velocity oxygen - rich filaments provide an independent estimate of the age of n132d .",
    "the most detailed analysis of the velocity field of n132d has been carried out by morse et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who find an expansion velocity of @xmath191650  for filaments with a mean radius of 5.3 pc , that results in a kinematic age of @xmath193200 yr assuming undecelerated motion .",
    "this value is considerably less than the sedov dynamical age we quote in table 2 .",
    "this discrepancy between the kinematic age and the sedov dynamical age was noted before ( hughes 1987 ) and it led to the suggestion that n132d exploded within a low - density cavity evacuated by the stellar wind and ionizing radiation of the high - mass progenitor . in this scenario ,",
    "the outer shell of emission is the main blast wave that has reached the edge of the cavity and is now interacting with the high density material there .",
    "the high density of the ambient medium can be explained by the presence of a giant molecular cloud associated with n132d ( banas et al .",
    "our work with the  spectra provides yet another independent estimate of the age , based on the ionization timescale , which is also considerably less than the sedov dynamical age and supports the cavity scenario .",
    "our derived n132d abundances for the elements from oxygen to iron are higher by , at most , a factor of three than those derived by hwang et al .",
    "( 1993 ) using data from the .",
    "there are several reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first our  sis data are of considerably higher quality ( in all respects : higher sensitivity , lower background , better spectral resolution , more accurate calibration , and coverage of a broader x - ray band ) than the  sss data used by hwang et al .",
    "our sedov models provide a more realistic description of the physical conditions in the snr than the single - temperature single - timescale phenomenological nei models used previously .",
    "the fitted column density in our work is about a factor of 2 more than that of hwang et al . , which tends to increase our fitted abundances relative to theirs .",
    "note that both our fitted column density and hwang et al.s are consistent with the total column of neutral hydrogen toward n132d , @xmath114 @xmath7 .",
    "we believe our x - ray determination of the absorbing column density is more accurate because it is based on a more realistic spectral model and because the  data are better calibrated in the important band below 1 kev .",
    "additionally , we can point to the excellent correlation we get between the column and the x - ray column for the seven snrs in our sample to support the general accuracy of our results .",
    "another determination of n132d s abundances was recently presented by favata et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using x - ray spectral data from bepposax .",
    "these results are in strong disagreement with the results we present here and thus the discrepancy requires some explanation .",
    "first we note that the column density derived by favata et al .",
    ", @xmath115 @xmath7 ( but with large error ) , is considerably larger than the total column of neutral hydrogen toward n132d quoted above . because of their higher column density",
    "their abundances will be spuriously high .",
    "their two - component nei model is a somewhat better model than the single - component model used by hwang et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , but it is not as realistic as our sedov - phase model .",
    "however , the difference in spectral models does not fully explain the difference in derived abundances .",
    "we also applied a two - component nei model to the  sis data of n132d and found best - fit temperatures of 0.50.6 kev ( component a ) and 2.23.5 kev ( component b ) with a ratio of emission measures of 0.050.06 ( b / a ) , values that are similar to favata et al .",
    "however , this two - component nei model still resulted in low values for the abundances using the  sis data : @xmath116 for oxygen , @xmath117 for neon , and @xmath118 for iron .",
    "an oxygen abundance as high as 1.2 ( as derived from the bepposax data ) would produce a huge k@xmath18 oxygen line in the sis that we just do nt see .",
    "we believe that the main difference in our results arises from the poorer spectral resolution of the bepposax data compared to the data from the sis .",
    "the abundances are determined from the emission line strengths , so clearly better spectral resolution is important .",
    "however , the derived abundances are sensitive to the ionization timescales which can only be constrained accurately if lines from helium- and hydrogen - like ionic species can be resolved .",
    "we resolve these lines in the sis data , while the bepposax data does not .",
    "we also have an astrophysical objection to the large abundances quoted by favata et al .",
    "if their abundances were correct , it would require that we are seeing all of the enriched ejecta from a massive progenitor .",
    "in particular , according to the favata et al .",
    "results , the amount of `` extra '' mass in oxygen above the amount in the swept - up ism is @xmath194 @xmath81 which is comparable to the entire mass of oxygen ejected by a 25 @xmath81 progenitor ( thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) .",
    "since we see oxygen - rich filaments in the optical band , at least some of the ejecta have cooled below @xmath19@xmath25 k and therefore can not be contributing to the x - ray emission",
    ". clearly definitive answers to questions about the amount and distribution of enriched x - ray  emitting ejecta in n132d must await  observations .",
    "this remnant is located in the western edge of the lmc and , like n23 above , is also rather poorly studied .",
    "it has been tentatively classified as the remnant of a type ia sne ( pop ii ) by ck88 due to the lack of nearby ob stars , regions , and co emission .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the low preshock density we derive for 0453@xmath068.5 ( @xmath119 @xmath103 , the lowest value in the sample ) , although a lack of evidence for an overabundance of iron , as seen for dem71 , is a ( weak ) countervailing factor .",
    "the line - of - sight column density is low , similar to the values found for n23 and dem71 , and probably arises mostly from the interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "optically , n49b consists of two sets of bright knots separated on the sky by approximately @xmath120 and embedded in a patchy network of diffuse nebulosity .",
    "its x - ray appearance is entirely different , showing a somewhat limb - brightened , nearly - circular region of emission that encompasses both sets of optical knots .",
    "on the basis of its location within the  region dem 181 , ck88 identify n49b with a pop i progenitor , a picture that is consistent with our finding that n49b is the result of an explosion within a preexisting cavity in the ism .",
    "the relatively high column density toward this remnant suggests that its association with molecular emission ( cohen et al .",
    "1988 ) may be more than an accidental projection effect .",
    "we have carried out a systematic analysis of the  sis x - ray spectra of seven luminous snrs in the lmc .",
    "our work has resulted in the following conclusions .",
    "( 1 ) : :    the spectral data are described well by a nei model that includes the    time evolution of density and temperature given by the sedov    similarity solution for the dynamical evolution of snrs . this model    was a better description of the data than any single or multiple    component phenomenological nei model that we tried .",
    "( 2 ) : :    the x - ray data provide 4 independent constraints on the 3 independent    parameters of the sedov model .",
    "the observational constraints are :    radius , shock temperature , emission measure , and ionization timescale .",
    "the parameters of the sedov model are age , initial explosion energy ,    and ambient ism density .",
    "there is an additional ambiguity in the    models that arises from the unknown relationship between the energy    imparted to electrons and ions at the shock front .",
    "we model two    extreme situations : full equilibration ( in which the electron and ion    temperatures are assumed to be equal ) and coulomb equilibration ( in    which the electrons gain energy from the ions though coulomb    collisions only ) .",
    "( 3 ) : :    four of the remnants in the sample , n23 , n49 , dem71 , and    0453@xmath068.5 , are fully consistent with sedov evolution    under the assumption of coulomb equilibration . for this group of    remnants",
    "the mean explosion energy is    @xmath3 ergs in agreement with the    canonical value .",
    "the key to discriminating between the full and    coulomb equilibration models comes from comparing the sedov dynamical    age with the age determined from the ionization timescale .",
    "( 4 ) : :    when the derived parameters of the other three snrs , n63a , n132d , and    n49b , are examined in detail , they appear to be internally    inconsistent .",
    "in particular the age determined by the ionization    timescale is considerably less than the sedov dynamical age ,    regardless of whether one assumes the full or coulomb equilibration    models .",
    "furthermore the initial sn explosion energies are large    @xmath4@xmath68 ergs .",
    "both of these    discrepancies can be explained by invoking a scenario in which the    remnants exploded within preexisting cavities or bubbles in the ism    and that the x - ray emission we see now comes from the blast wave    interacting with the dense material at the cavity wall .",
    "this was    previously suggested for n132d to explain the discrepancy between this    remnant s sedov age and the kinematic age determined from the    expansion of high - velocity oxygen - rich filaments .",
    "our independent    estimate of n132d s age from its ionization timescale confirms this    earlier result and it gives confidence that n63a and n49b are actually    two more examples of this phenomenon .",
    "this result is not particularly    surprising since it is precisely the manner in which massive stars are    predicted to modify their environment .",
    "( 5 ) : :    we find statistical evidence for enrichment by supernova ejecta in the    sense that smaller remnants show a somewhat higher mean metallicity    than the larger ones . on the other hand , the mean metallicity does not    correlate with swept - up mass . in the case of the balmer - dominated snr    dem71 , which is likely to be the remnant of a type ia supernova , the    derived abundance of iron is about a factor of two larger than the    other remnants in the sample .",
    "this corresponds to an excess of iron    over the amount in the ism of @xmath190.06    @xmath81 , which is about 10% of the total amount of iron    ejected by a type ia sn .",
    "( 6 ) : :    all things being considered , however , the middle - aged , evolved snrs in    our sample are in general dominated by swept - up ism and so can be used    to estimate the mean lmc gas - phase abundances .",
    "we find that the common    elements from oxygen to iron have abundances 0.20.4 times solar ,    consistent with previous results based on optical and uv data , but    without the anomalous overabundance of mg and si seen by others .",
    "this    work demonstrates the validity of using x - ray spectra of snrs to    measure the current chemical composition of interstellar gas and it    has the potential to provide a significant new constraint on the    chemical evolution and star formation history of the cloud .",
    "( 7 ) : :    we set limits on the hard ( @xmath43 kev ) x - ray flux of the    remnants that correspond to luminosities of from @xmath121 to    @xmath122 in the 0.24.0 kev    band .",
    "these limits indicate that the remnants in the sample do not    contain very luminous pulsar - powered synchrotron nebulae , as is    consistent with our picture of them as evolved middle - aged snrs .",
    "however , the quoted luminosity range is consistent with the possiblity    that they contain weaker synchrotron nebulae with pulsars losing    energy at a slower rate than is the case in the crab nebula , for    example .",
    "the discovery of such pulsar - powered synchrotron nebulae    would definitively identify the progenitor as a massive star that    underwent a core collapse sn .",

    "<S> we present the results of x - ray spectroscopy of a flux - limited sample of seven middle - aged supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) : n23 , n49 , n63a , dem71 , n132d , 0453@xmath068.5 , and n49b . </S>",
    "<S> we constructed self - consistent nonequilibrium ionization snr models assuming a sedov solution for the dynamical evolution , and then applied the resulting spectral models to the data obtained by the solid - state imaging spectrometer onboard the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics_. all the remnants were reasonably well described by the model , allowing us to derive accurate values for their physical parameters , i.e. , ages , densities , initial explosion energies , and metal abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the derived explosion energies vary from @xmath1 erg to @xmath2 erg . a restricted subset of the sample exists for which the ionization and sedov dynamical ages agree quite well under the assumption that the electron and ion temperatures are not fully equilibrated at the shock front ; for these four snrs the mean value of the initial explosion energy is @xmath3 erg . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is likely that the other three remnants exploded within preexisting cavities in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the limits on high energy x - ray emission ( @xmath43 kev ) that we present indicate that these snrs do not contain very luminous pulsar - powered synchrotron nebulae , in general agreement with our picture of them as evolved , middle - aged remnants . </S>",
    "<S> we find statistical evidence for enrichment by supernova ejecta in the sense that smaller remnants show a somewhat higher mean metallicity than the larger ones . in the case of dem71 , </S>",
    "<S> the putative remnant of a type ia supernova , the derived abundance of iron is about a factor of two larger than the other remnants in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> these things being said , however , the derived abundances are in general dominated by swept - up interstellar material and so we use the snr sample to estimate the mean lmc gas - phase abundances . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the astrophysically common elements from oxygen to iron are less abundant than the solar values by factors of 24 . </S>",
    "<S> overall these results are consistent with previous ones based on optical and uv data , but do not show the anomalous overabundance of magnesium and silicon seen by others .    </S>",
