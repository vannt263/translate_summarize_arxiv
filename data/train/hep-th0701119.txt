    "one of the first steps in understanding the @xmath5 correspondence is to set up a precise dictionary between the states of the theories on the two sides of the correspondence .",
    "it is well known that the parameters of the @xmath6 @xmath7 sym , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 should be identified with the parameters of type iib string theory on @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 , as @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we may consider solutions to the supergravity equations of motion which are asymptotically @xmath1 as good candidates for dual of states in the cft , provided that @xmath14 and any dimension four curvature invariant of the solutions , @xmath15 , satisfies @xmath16 here and in @xcite we address the problem of finding bps supergravity solutions which are dual to chiral primary operators of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the three complex scalars of the @xmath20 cft and the coefficients @xmath21 are chosen to give a ( anti)-symmetrization and trace structure such that the @xmath22-wave mode on @xmath23 of these operators are bps .",
    "the corresponding states saturate the bps bound : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the conformal dimension of the operator .",
    "we will also assume that the index structure is such that the states preserve an @xmath26 subgroup of the @xmath27 @xmath28-symmetry group .",
    "the full amount of bosonic symmetry preserved by these states is : @xmath29 the first @xmath30 corresponds to the transformations generated by @xmath31 where @xmath32 generates phase shifts on @xmath19 , @xmath33 generates simultaneous equal phase shifts on @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the dilatation operator and the last @xmath36 factor represents the fact that we are considering @xmath22-wave modes on @xmath23 in the reduction of sym theory on @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we start from an ansatz for the metric and the self - dual rr 5-form which preserves this amount of symmetry .",
    "we also require that the background possesses the required amount of supersymmetry by demanding that it possesses a killing spinor .",
    "we look for geometries dual to the states in . they will thus be invariant under @xmath38 as defined in the previous section and invariant but charged under the remaining @xmath39 .",
    "the extra non - compact time - like symmetry ( @xmath40 of the previous section ) is associated to invariance under the transformations generated by @xmath41 in the gauge theory and will emerge as a direct consequence of supersymmetry .",
    "the most generic ansatz consistent with these symmetries is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are functions of the four coordinates @xmath48 .",
    "the space is a fibration of a squashed 3-sphere ( on which the @xmath49 left - invariant 1-forms @xmath50 are defined ) and a round 3-sphere over a four dimensional manifold .",
    "since we are looking for the geometric dual to operators which involve only scalar fields in the gauge theory , the only possible non - zero ramond - ramond field strength is the five form @xmath51 .",
    "the most generic ansatz for the five form which is invariant under the given symmetries is : @xmath52 with @xmath53\\wedge \\tilde\\rho^3{\\mathrm{d}}\\tilde \\omega_3\\ ] ]    supersymmetry is guaranteed by the existence of a supersymmetry parameter @xmath54 such that the gravitino variation it generates vanishes : @xmath55 the vector @xmath56 is killing and timelike and it generates the extra non - compact timelike @xmath3",
    ". we may thus choose the time coordinate @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "the bianchi identity @xmath59 and the existence of the spinor @xmath54 are sufficient for our supergravity background to satisfy the full equations of motion of type iib supergravity and to express the complete solution in the following form @xcite : @xmath60 where the coordinate @xmath61 is the product of two radii @xmath62 all the entries of the metric depend only on @xmath63 and can be expressed in terms of four independent functions @xmath64 as follows : @xmath65\\label{firstdv}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 indicates the hodge dual in the three dimensional diagonal metric @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , one can completely express the 5-form in terms of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the complete analysis in @xcite show that these solutions preserve generically 4 of the 32 supersymmetries of type iib supergravity .",
    "the bianchi identities and integrability conditions give rise to a set of nonlinear coupled elliptic differential equations @xmath68 + 4 y^2 d t^2 n=0\\\\ & y^3 ( { \\partial}_1 ^ 2+{\\partial}_2 ^ 2 ) m + { \\partial}_y \\left(y^3 t^2 { \\partial}_y m\\right ) + { \\partial}_y \\left ( y^3 t^2 2 m d\\right)=0\\\\ & y^3 ( { \\partial}_1 ^ 2+{\\partial}_2 ^ 2 ) p + { \\partial}_y \\left(y^3 t^2 { \\partial}_y p\\right ) + { \\partial}_y \\big [ y^3 t^2 4n y(n - p)\\big]=0\\\\ & { \\partial}_y \\ln t = d\\qquad",

    "a solution to the equations presented in the previous section is determined by a set of boundary conditions at infinity ( large values of @xmath69 ) and on the plane @xmath70 ; they should be chosen in such a way as to give an asymptotically to @xmath10 non - singular geometry . due to the non - linearity of the equations",
    "the relationship between boundary conditions and non - singular solutions with @xmath10 asymptotics is difficult to control .",
    "the solutions described in @xcite , are a subset of ours specified by the additional constraints , @xmath71 in this case we have @xmath72 and the three second order equations collapse to one single linear equation .",

    "in this section we discuss asymptotic solutions to the differential equations in for large values of @xmath63 which give @xmath1 asymptotics .",

    "in the previous section we assumed that @xmath79 is a killing vector of our metric . this lifts the internal symmetry to @xmath89 . we can further restrict our solutions requiring that they preserve 8 instead of only 4 supersymmetries .",

    "type iib string theory on @xmath4 is conjectured to be dual to an @xmath91 quiver gauge theory specified by the 2 integers @xmath92 .",
    "it is clear that , within our formalism , we can describe asymptotically @xmath4 solutions which are dual to operators in the corresponding quiver theory which preserve one half of its supersymmetry .",
    "we can show an explicit example for the case of @xmath93 @xcite .",
