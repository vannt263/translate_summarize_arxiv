    "according to the cisco visual network index ( vni ) report  @xcite , the monthly global mobile data traffic has reached 3.7 exabytes in 2015 , and is expected to increase nearly eightfolds attaining 30.6 exabytes by 2020 . in order to cope with this sheer volume of data traffic , a natural move to the next generation of wireless communication systems ( 5 g ) is needed .",
    "this is achieved by involving key technologies  @xcite including networks ultra - densification .",
    "the main driver behind ultra - densification is to substantially increase existing macro - cellular networks capacity  @xcite .",
    "ultimately , forecasts predict that by the time 5 g comes to fruition , there will be more base stations ( bss ) than mobile handsets  @xcite .",
    "the growing number of bss , typically low power nodes ( micro , pico , and femto base stations ) , also called small - cells  @xcite , gives rise to many new challenges .",
    "especially , those related to heterogeneity , optimization , and scaling . clearly , as the number of heterogeneous small - cells grows tremendously , the amount of interferences will increase significantly  @xcite leading to the so - called _ curse of dimensionality _",
    "the amount of data , that is exchanged between bss in order to handle interferences , raises exponentially with the number of interfering bss ( dimensionality ) resulting in a heavily loaded network ( mainly with signaling messages ) .",
    "self - organizing networks ( son ) are by far the most important approach to rise above dimensionality issues related to small - cells deployments  @xcite . not only do self - organizing networks enable to the network an automated resource management and improve bss coordination , but son can significantly reduce operators capex ( capital expenditures ) and opex ( operating expenses ) , especially by reducing human intervention and optimizing available resources .",
    "however , as the number of low power nodes grows increasingly , the overall energy consumption of small - cells base stations can not be ignored .",
    "a relevant amount of energy could be saved  @xcite .",
    "mechanisms for energy - aware nodes are more than desirable .",
    "son should implement energy saving techniques in order to prolong the lifetime of the batteries and increase the energy efficiency .    in order to achieve energy efficiency ,",
    "several techniques such as sleep mode optimizations  @xcite , power control mechanisms  @xcite , and learning algorithms can be used . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in achieving energy efficiency through a satisfaction mechanism .",
    "practically , instead of achieving the best network performance by maximizing qos , which is generally energy costly , nodes can only target satisfactory qos levels , and hence , work efficiently .",
    "the choice of satisfactory qos levels is merely endorsed by the two following reasons :    1 .",
    "first , as the number of base stations is highly increasing , probably overtaking the number of mobile devices in the next few years , the average number of devices per cell will decrease significantly .",
    "in such a context , optimization based on the full buffer traffic assumption , i.e. the user always asks for maximizing its qos , can not hold true .",
    "unfortunately , this case can lead to resource consuming requests , while saving energy is possible without any significant deterioration of the user - perceived rate  @xcite .",
    "second , many mobile applications ( e.g. real - time services such as video conferencing and online gaming ) require only fixed data rates in order to run properly . assuming additional qos demand will convey wasteful resources  @xcite .    the main contribution of this paper is to present a novel approach while dealing with energy efficiency in son .",
    "our paper addresses the following questions : how to reach a target qos while minimizing energy consumption ? given a realistic wireless framework , how to select the most efficient power allocation that meets with users expectations ?",
    "to answer these questions _ efficiently _ and _ satisfactorily _ , a game theoretical approach is adopted .",
    "game theory provides powerful tools  @xcite and gives clear insights on interacting nodes behaviors .",
    "one of the well - known game theoretical solution concepts is the _",
    "nash equilibrium _ ( ne ) .",
    "ne is a strategy profile where no player has the incentive to deviate unilaterally .",
    "it has been shown that the ne generally fails to model the network performance . indeed , when each player acts selfishly by increasing its power , subsequent interferences increase driving the network to a suboptimal situation .    alternatively , in order to support the users qos requirements , the _ constrained nash equilibrium _",
    "( cne , also called _ generalized nash equilibrium _ )",
    "is introduced  @xcite .",
    "particularly , constrained games are concerned with payoffs maximization ( or minimization ) subject to coupled and/or orthogonal constraints over the players strategies and/or payoffs .",
    "hence , at a cne , each player aims at achieving its optimal utility while satisfying qos constraints .",
    "the cne is designed to accommodate with qos requirements that the ne fails to model .",
    "nevertheless , from a practical point of view , the cne can be a very restrictive solution that ( i ) reduces the set of players strategies , and ( ii ) requires costly efforts .",
    "more precisely , in order to reach the highest payoffs , greater efforts , such as higher powers , are generally needed .",
    "this may lead to a lower energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of the network .",
    "consequently , a less restrictive solution concept , namely _ satisfaction equilibrium _ ( se ) , has been introduced  @xcite .",
    "mainly , in a less restrictive framework , players can only target satisfactory qos levels without aiming at achieving the highest payoffs . at an se ,",
    "utilities optimization assumption is relaxed .",
    "the payoffs should only be above given thresholds based on users services requirements .",
    "hence , ( i ) energy costs related to payoffs maximization are saved , and ( ii ) players constraints are satisfied .",
    "note that the cne can also be seen as an se of a satisfaction game , since players constraints are always satisfied at a cne  @xcite .",
    "yet , the reverse is not necessarily true .",
    "the energy efficiency function was introduced by meshkati _",
    "_ in  @xcite .",
    "this function measures the performance of the network per joule of consumed energy . for each node ,",
    "the ratio : @xmath0 is reduced .",
    "the work in  @xcite investigates energy efficiency in ultra - dense networks through joint power control and users scheduling .",
    "the problem of energy efficiency maximization is formulated as a dynamic stochastic game and cast as a mean - field game .",
    "the authors show that the mean - field equilibrium saves energy and reduces outage probability . in  @xcite",
    ", the energy efficiency for multiple input multiple output antennas heterogeneous networks is studied using a non - cooperative and cooperative power control game .",
    "the authors propose a power allocation algorithm in order to reach pareto optimal solutions .",
    "authors in  @xcite transform the energy efficiency problem maximization to a power minimization problem .",
    "a power allocation algorithm based on semidefinite programming is therefore proposed to achieve energy efficiency . in  @xcite ,",
    "lakshminarayana _ et al .",
    "_ are also interested in power minimization .",
    "they present the problem of saving energy in small - cells under time constraints . the impact of delayed information is analyzed and a lyapanov optimization is proposed .",
    "although game theory has been widely adopted to model network dynamics , very little attention has been paid to satisfactory solutions . in  @xcite ,",
    "perlaza _ et al .",
    "_ investigate conditions for existence of satisfaction equilibria in a general framework of qos provisioning in self - configuring networks .",
    "authors also study conditions for existence and uniqueness of efficient se ( ese ) .",
    "sufficient conditions for convergence of distributed algorithms that reach se are presented by meriaux _",
    "_ in  @xcite .",
    "authors in  @xcite present convergence analysis to an se , ese , and satisfactory solutions that are not equilibria .      in this work ,",
    "we address the problem of energy - aware user satisfaction in son .",
    "our main objective is to meet the users requirements while reducing the energy consumption .",
    "accordingly , we aim at seeking for satisfaction equilibria , mainly the ese in both stationary and random channels context .    for this paper , while we refer to earlier works  @xcite and  @xcite , the focus is different :    1 .   first , when the channels follow a slow fading model : * we fully characterize the ese while considering information - theoretic transmission rate based measure , and prove that , whenever it exists , it is the unique solution of a given linear system . *",
    "we prove that satisfactory qos levels and channel states are correlated to the transmit powers . for a desired qos level ,",
    "the users need to adjust their powers according to their channel states .",
    "specifically , when the channel state decreases , the required transmit power increases .",
    "* we introduce `` satisfactory pareto optimality '' property and show that the ese is satisfactory pareto optimal .",
    "mainly , at the ese , no user can increase its payoff without dissatisfying its opponents .",
    "second , when the channels are fast varying over time : * we define the `` robust satisfaction equilibrium '' and introduce a novel solution concept , namely the `` long term satisfaction equilibrium '' , which is less restrictive , and hence , more energy efficient . * in order to achieve energy efficiency , we seek for power allocations that minimize the channels variance while averagely respecting users requirements .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is that we propose fully distributed algorithms : ( i ) based on banach - picard iterations in order to reach the ese for continuous power states and stationary channels , ( ii ) a modified version of banach - picard referred to as `` the progressive banach - picard algorithm for capacity discovery '' to reach the maximum network capacity , ( iii ) an updated version of bush - mosteller algorithm in order to converge to the ese when the channels are stationary and the power states spaces are discrete , ( iv ) and mann iterates based algorithm for fast varying channels in order to reach the efficient long term satisfaction equilibrium .",
    "finally , we show the qualitative properties of the proposed algorithms through simulation results .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section presents the system model .",
    "section  [ stationary ] formulates the problem as a satisfaction game under a stationary channel assumption and describes some properties related to the set of satisfacion equilibria .",
    "a full characterization of ese is also provided and the pareto optimality property is studied . in section  [ random ] , under channel randomness assumption ,",
    "satisfactory solutions are investigated . in section",
    "[ fully ] , we present distributed schemes in order to reach efficient solutions for both stationary and random channels .",
    "section [ simulations ] presents numerical results to illustrate the performance of the studied algorithms . finally , in the last section",

    "we denote by @xmath2 the set of ( mss ) .",
    "users operate over the same radio channel .",
    "the radio channel is first supposed stationary , and , then , fast varying within time .",
    "the channel is considered slow or fast varying depending on the time the channel states change compared to the coherence time .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the power fading gain between user @xmath4 and the concentration point .",

    "hence , the users constraints are unfeasible ( inequality  ( [ unfeasible ] ) is not satisfied ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",

    "in this paper , we proposed a satisfaction equilibrium approach in order to reduce energy consumption for users in self - organizing networks .",
    "we were mainly interested in the efficient satisfaction equilibrium for both stationary and fast fading channels .",
    "we showed that we studied conditions of existence and uniqueness of ese under a stationary channel assumption and fully characterized the ese by the solution of a linear system .",
