    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are thought to be ubiquitous in the centers of virtually all massive galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; richstone et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",
    "the close connection of black hole growth to galaxy evolution is inferred from the discovery of tight correlations between the masses of smbhs ( @xmath2 ) and the global properties of host galaxies , such as the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 ; ferraresse & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) bulge luminosity ( @xmath4 ; magorrian et al . 1998",
    "; marconi & hunt 2003 ) , and bulge mass ( @xmath5 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . the origin of these connections has been investigated in theoretical studies of galaxy evolution either through the introduction of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; croton et al . 2006 ; hopkins et al . 2006 ; bower et al . 2006 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; booth & schaye 2009 ) or as simply being the result of a hierarchical merging framework ( e.g. , peng 2007 ; hirschmann et al .",
    "2010 ; janke & maccio 2011 ) .",
    "the interplay between the black holes and galaxies is now one of the basic ingredients in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .    in order to better understand the origin and evolution of the smbh - host galaxy connection , agn demographics , and the growth of the smbhs through cosmic time ,",
    "an accurate and precise measurement of black hole mass is essential .",
    "stellar / gas dynamical modeling is commonly used to measure the black hole masses in quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , this technique requires high spatial resolution to resolve the sphere - of - influence of the black hole , thereby limiting it to the local universe . in active galaxies",
    ", the black hole mass can be determined by utilizing agn variability .",
    "the reverberation mapping technique ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) has been used to estimate the mean size of the broad line region ( blr , @xmath6 ) by cross - correlating the continuum light curve with the broad emission line light curve . combining @xmath6 with the line - of - sight velocity width ( @xmath7 ) measured from the variable component of the broad emission line provides a virial black hole mass estimate as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant and @xmath10 is the virial factor that converts the measured virial product into the actual black hole mass .",
    "this technique is also limited to around 50 agns to date since it requires extensive photometric and spectroscopic monitoring observations .",
    "this technique has established the empirical size - luminosity relation ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; bentz et al .",
    "2006a , 2009a ) , which is the basis for the single - epoch ( se ) method . in the se method ,",
    "one simply substitutes the time - consuming blr size measurement with agn luminosity using the size - luminosity relation .",
    "this therefore provides estimates of black hole masses for broad line agns from a single spectroscopic observation , thus expanding the sample size substantially at any redshift .",
    "however , both methods suffer from the large uncertainty stemming from the unknown virial factor ( see park et al .",
    "2012 ) , which depends on the geometry and kinematics of blr of individual agns .    instead",
    ", an empirically calibrated average virial factor has been applied to most agn black hole mass estimates , except for only a few objects where dynamical mass measurements can be obtained ( e.g. , davies et al .",
    "2006 ; onken et al . 2007 ; hicks & malkan 2008 ) .",
    "the first calibration of the virial factor was performed by onken et al .",
    "they derived @xmath11 based on a sample of @xmath12 agns , for which both reverberation masses and stellar velocity dispersions were available , by forcing the agn host galaxies to obey the same @xmath0  relationship as for quiescent galaxies . by enlarging the dynamical range of the agn sample ,",
    "woo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) determined the virial factor as @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) based on an updated reverberation sample of 24 agns , which included 8 low - mass local seyfert 1 galaxies from the lick agn monitoring project ( bentz et al .",
    "they provided the upper limit of uncertainty in the derived virial factor as 0.43 dex based on the intrinsic scatter in the relation .",
    "in contrast , graham et al . ( 2011 ) reported @xmath15 , based on their updated @xmath0  relation of quiescent galaxies , and an upated agn sample , which is a factor of 2 smaller than the aforementioned values .",
    "graham et al .",
    "( 2011 ) commented that the value of @xmath16 might be even further lowered due to the effect of radiation pressure ( see marconi et al .",
    "this correspondingly reduces the black hole mass estimates for most agns by that amount , influencing all of the studies incorporating single - epoch agn black hole masses .",
    "thus it is important to investigate the origin of this difference and check for possible biases in the calibration process .    since the derived @xmath0  relation of quiescent galaxies is used to calibrate the virial factor in agn mass estimators , under the assumption that the same @xmath0  relation holds for agn host galaxies , it is important to investigate the differences in the @xmath0  relations of quiescent galaxies reported in the literature , and to study their effect on the derived virial factors . originally the slopes of the @xmath0  relation reported by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were @xmath17 and @xmath18 based on 12 and 26 galaxy samples , respectively .",
    "after that , various slopes have been reported in the literature , ranging from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "although the slopes are roughly consistent with the theoretical expectations of @xmath21 ( silk & rees 1998 ) and @xmath22 ( fabian 1999 ) , their difference and change are noteworthy .",
    "the possible origin of the difference in slopes has been investigated in the literature .",
    "the related factors are : ( 1 ) the type of regression method adopted ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; novak et al .",
    "2006 ; see kelly 2007 for general applications of regression ) , ( 2 ) the size of the assigned uncertainty on the velocity dispersion ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , ( 3 ) the velocity dispersion measures used ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , ( 4 ) the adopted value of velocity dispersion for the milky way ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al . 2002 ) , ( 5 ) the spatial resolution of the data for the resolved bh sphere - of - influence ( ferrarese & ford 2005 ; see also gltekin et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ; batcheldor 2010 ) ( 6 ) the morphological type of the sample used ( hu 2008 ; graham 2008 ; gltekin et al . 2009 ; greene et al . 2010 ; graham et al .",
    "2011 ) .    to understand the origin of the differences in the derived @xmath0  relationships , we investigate in this work 3 main issues : the difference in samples , the difference in regression methods , and the direction of the regression analysis",
    "recently , with new measurements and improved modeling the number of dynamical mass measurements is continuously growing both at the high - mass and low - mass end regimes . to date , a total of 67 black hole masses in quiescent galaxies has been measured via stellar / gas / maser kinematics ( see the most recent compilation from mcconnell et al . 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it is presently a good time to investigate what effect the difference in samples has on the derived @xmath0  relation using the largest sample ever .",
    "in addition , various estimators have been used for the regression analysis in the black hole scaling relation studies : ` fitexy ` ( e.g. , tremaine et al .",
    "2002 , novak et al .",
    "2006 , kim et al .",
    "2008 , li et al .",
    "2011 , beifiori et al .",
    "2012 , vika et al .",
    "2012 , mcconnell et al .",
    "2011 ) , ` bces ` ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 , ferrarese & ford 2005 , hu 2008 , bentz et al .",
    "2009a , bennert et al .",
    "2010 , graham et al .",
    "2011 ) , ` maximum likelihood ` ( e.g. , gltekin et al .",
    "2009 , greene et al .",
    "2010 , schulze & gebhardt 2011 ) , bayesian approach ( ` linmix_err ` ) ( e.g. , sani et al .",
    "2011 , xiao et al .",
    "2011 , mancini & feoli 2012 ) .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the difference in the derived scaling relationships caused by the sample selection , it is important to investigate differences between the estimators for the @xmath0  relation analysis . finally , adopting the choice of independent variable is another issue for determining the @xmath0  relation .",
    "motivated by the suggestion by graham et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to use the ` inverse ' fit to calibrate the single - epoch agn mass estimates , we present results based on both of the forward and inverse regressions .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we describe the most commonly used regression methods in astronomy with their explicit implementations . in section  [ sec : msigma ] , we re - measure the @xmath0  relation using 3 different samples from the literature and investigate the difference due to the regression methods and samples .",
    "in section  [ sec : virial_factor ] we present our main result for the calibrated virial factors and discuss the difference based on the regression methods and samples . the difference from the direction of regression",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec : inverse ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "linear regression methods in astronomy were exhaustively discussed in the pioneering paper , isobe et al .",
    "they provided formulae for 5 unweighted bivariate linear regression coefficients with their error estimates , and recommended the bisector line for the case of treating the variables symmetrically .",
    "the second paper in the series , feigelson & babu ( 1992 ) , extended their work by accommodating bootstrap and jackknife resampling procedures for error estimation , weighted regression , and truncated / censored regressions .",
    "in addition , they suggested practical strategies for linear regression problems in astronomy .",
    "the ` bces ` estimator ( bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter ) was proposed by akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) in order to incorporate , heteroscedastic measurement errors , intrinsic scatter , and correlation in the measurement errors .",
    "the method of minimizing a @xmath23 statistic ( ` fitexy ` ) , which account for measurement error in both the dependent and independent variable , was modified by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to incorporate intrinsic scatter .",
    "they added the unknown constant intrinsic variance term in quadrature to the error of the dependent variable and determined it so that the reduced @xmath23 is equal to a value of unity .",
    "based on the monte carlo simulations performed by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and novak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , they concluded that the modified ` fitexy ` is a better estimator than the ` bces ` .",
    "in particular , tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) concluded that the ` bces ` tends to be biased when the sample size is small or the mean square of the x errors is comparable to the variance of x distribution , and that it becomes inefficient when there is a single measurement with much larger error than others .",
    "kelly ( 2007 ) developed a sophisticated bayesian linear regression technique , termed ` linmix_err ` .",
    "it accounts for intrinsic scatter in the relationship , heteroscedastic measurement errors in both the independent and dependent variables , and correlation between the measurement errors .",
    "this method uses a gaussian mixture model for the distribution of independent variables , which is shown to work well particularly when the measurement errors are large by avoiding the bias incorporated if the choice of x - distribution model is incorrect ( also noted in auger et al .",
    "the method assumes that the measurement errors and intrinsic scatter are gaussian , and it accommodates multiple independent variables , nondetections , and selection effects .",
    "recently , gltekin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) applied a ` maximum likelihood ` method to determine the @xmath24 and @xmath25 relations by naturally incorporating an intrinsic scatter and upper limits .",
    "they also extensively investigated the distributional forms for the measurement error and intrinsic scatter .",
    "however , they did not include a model for the distribution of the independent variable , but instead used monte carlo sampling to assess the impact of the measurement errors in the independent variable on the parameter estimates .    to sum up , the four methods for linear regression that have been used to characterize the black hole / host galaxy scaling relationships are : ( 1 ) ` bces ` ( akritas & bershady 1996 ) , ( 2 ) ` fitexy ` ( tremaine et al . 2002 ) , ( 3 ) ` maximum likelihood ` ( gltekin et al .",
    "2009 ) , ( 4 ) ` linmix_err ` ( kelly 2007 ) . in this section",
    "we explicitly show our implementation and usage of each method .",
    "we assume the model of @xmath26 in the following analysis .",
    "the ` bces`(@xmath27 ) estimator is implemented using the formula described in akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the covariance of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the standard deviation of the measurement error ( i.e. , standard measurement error ) in @xmath30 , @xmath33 is the variance of @xmath30 , and @xmath34 is the covariance between the measurement errors in @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the intrinsic variance ( i.e. , variance in the intrinsic scatter ) is estimated following the expression given in cheng & riu ( 2006 ) and kelly ( 2007 ) , @xmath35 } .\\ ] ] the uncertainties in the parameters can be estimated with the bootstrap or using analytical estimates given in akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath36 ( i.e. , uncorrelated measurement errors ) , as most values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the @xmath0  samples were independently measured and the covariances between the measurement errors are not provided in the literature .",
    "thus , simply assuming the zero covariance seems to be more reasonable for these very heterogeneously collected @xmath0  samples .",
    "in addition , there is no result incorporating the correlated measurement errors ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) to @xmath0  fitting in the literature at least to our knowledge .",
    "thus , to compare consistently with the results from the literature we here set @xmath36 .",
    "the ` fitexy ` ( press et al . 1992 ) , modified by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , is implemented in our work in idl using the ` mpfit ` ( markwardt 2009 ) levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization routine .",
    "note that our implementation is basically similar to that given in williams et al .",
    "it performs the linear regression by minimizing @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the regression coefficients , @xmath32 and @xmath40 are the standard deviation in the measurement errors , and @xmath41 is the intrinsic variance .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is iteratively adjusted as an effective additional @xmath31 error by repeating the fit until one obtains @xmath43 ( i.e. , following the suggested iterative procedure given in bedregal et al . 2006 and bamford et al . 2006 ) . if after the initial iteration the reduced @xmath23 is less than one , then no further iterations occur and one sets @xmath44 .",
    "we estimate uncertainties in the regression parameters with the bootstrap method .",
    "the method of ` maximum likelihood ` is implemented similarly as given in gltekin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( see also woo et al .",
    "2010 ) . under the assumptions of uncorrelated gaussian measurement errors in both coordinates and gaussian intrinsic scatter along @xmath31 , the gaussian likelihood function",
    "is given by @xmath45 , \\label{eq : mle_l}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 note that this likelihood function implicitly assumes that the independent variable is uniformly distributed ( i.e. , a uniform prior for the intrinsic distribution of @xmath30 ) .",
    "then the log - likelihood function is @xmath47 this likelihood approach is more complete than the @xmath48 method given in equation  ( [ method : chi2 ] ) in a sense that it includes the intrinsic variance term in both the normalization and exponent of the likelihood function , and determines it simultaneously with the other regression coefficients . to estimate the best - fit parameters of @xmath49 using the maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) , we minimize @xmath50 using the downhill simplex method implemented as ` amoeba ` ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) in idl .",
    "then we adopt uncertainties in parameters as the average difference where @xmath51 decreases from its maximum value by @xmath52 .",
    "we also estimate the parameter errors using the bootstrap method .",
    "the bayesian linear regression routine , ` linmix_err ` , developed by kelly ( 2007 ) is available from the nasa idl astronomy user s library . here",
    "we briefly summarize the method . for details , please refer to kelly ( 2007 ) .",
    "this method assumes gaussian intrinsic scatter , gaussian measurement errors , and a weighted sum of @xmath53 gaussian functions for the distribution of the independent variable .",
    "the choice of a gaussian mixture model was motivated in that it can not only approximate well various intrinsic distributions of the independent variable , but it is also a mathematically convenient conjugate family . the full measured data likelihood function is expressed as a mixture of bivariate normal distributions @xmath54 ,         \\label{eq : bayesian_l}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and the measured data , means , and covariance matrices are , respectively , @xmath56 in order to calculate the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters for the given measured data , it adopts uniform prior distributions on the regression parameters @xmath57 .",
    "it also adopt a dirichlet , normal , and scaled inverse-@xmath23 prior on the mixture model parameters @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the data is ` fit ' using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler .",
    "for each regression parameter , we take the best - fit value and uncertainty as the posterior median and posterior standard deviation from the marginal posterior distributions using the 100,000 random draws returned by the mcmc sampler .",
    "note that the likelihood function given in equation  ( [ eq : bayesian_l ] ) converges to that of the ` maximum likelihood ` method given in equation  ( [ eq : mle_l ] ) if the distribution for the independent variable is assumed to be uniform rather than a mixture of normals and the measurement errors are uncorrelated .    as an illustration",
    ", we also used the likelihood function in the case of a single gaussian model ( @xmath59 ) for the distribution of independent variable with uncorrelated measurement errors ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "for comparison with the procedure assuming a uniform intrinsic distribution ( mle ) given in section  [ method : mle ] , we compute the maximum likelihood estimate ( i.e. , mle@xmath61 ) utilizing the likelihood function derived from assuming the distribution of independent variable is a gaussian .    in the following sections",

    ", width=302 ]    according to these previous studies , the @xmath0  relation seems to be not universal .",
    "it varies depending on the mass range and galaxy type .",
    "correspondingly , the average @xmath10 factor is also significantly affected by the sample population , since the intercept and slope from the quiescent galaxy @xmath0  relation are directly used in the calibration process . as investigated in this study ,",
    "the differences in the adopted sample contribute to the change of the virial factor .",
    "moreover , the direction of regression ( forward _ vs. _ inverse ) causes further changes in the virial factor .",
    "we showed that the derived @xmath10 factors vary as much as a factor of 2 , which is from a combined effect of the sample and regression used .",
    "these differences could be thought of as an additional systematic uncertainty in the agn black hole mass estimation via the current calibration process of the virial factor , since there is no obvious physical foundation for the selection of the appropriate sample and direction of regression .",
    "the true average @xmath10 factor should not be changed by the host galaxy type since there should be no direct physical link between the agn blr geometry and the global morphology of host galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the estimated average @xmath10 factor may be subject to biases due to its calibration based on a single @xmath0  relationship . however , since the current sample is not large enough to calibrate the virial factor as a function of galaxy type , it is better to use a single value of the mean @xmath10 factor for agn @xmath2  estimation in order to avoid additional systematic errors until we get enough direct measurements of the structure of the blr for an each individual agn .",
    "we note that an alternative method to measure agn black hole mass that derives the virial factor through blr modeling has been recently developed and applied to the reverberation data ( e.g. , pancoast , brewer , & treu 2011 ; brewer et al .",
    "2011 ; pancoast et al . 2012 ) . given the uncertainties in the @xmath10 factor , when investigating evolutionary trends in the @xmath0  relation based on se estimates , we recommend to use self consistent samples and techniques at different redshifts .",
    "in other words , one should measure the se black hole masses consistently for agn samples at different redshifts by using the cross - calibrated recipes based on the same virial factor . in this way",
    "the virial factor should be very similar for all samples and cancel out in the determination of the evolution of @xmath265 under the assumption that the virial factor is not a function of redshift ( e.g. , woo et al .",
    "2008 ) .    finally , we present the updated @xmath0  relation for local active galaxies based on the ` fitexy ` estimator in figure  [ fig : final_msigma ] , where the forward ( inverse ) regression result is @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and @xmath278 ( @xmath279 , @xmath280 , and @xmath281 ) .",
    "the agn black hole masses were converted from the virial products using the virial factor @xmath282 ( @xmath283 ) derived in section  [ sec : virial_factor ] . from a methodological point of view",
    ", we prefer the forward regression as discussed in section  [ sec : inverse ] .",
    "thus our preferred value for the virial factor is 0.71 based on the preferred forward ` fitexy / bayesian ` estimation with the most recent sample ( mcconnell et al .",
    "this value is consistent with that of woo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( i.e. , 0.72 ) and differs from that of graham et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( i.e. , 0.45 ) by @xmath284 dex .",
    "the difference arises from the combination of sample differences and regression differences .",
    "it is worth noticing that the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : final_msigma ] shows slightly better agreement between the non - agn and agn @xmath0  relations , which may indicate that the inverse regression has less bias than the forward one and thus might be more reliable .",
    "however , this conclusion only holds if we assume that the active and inactive galaxies share the same @xmath0  relationship . considering these issues ,",
    "it is still not conclusive whether the inverse method is preferable with the current datasets owing to selection effects and limited dynamic range of the agn sample .",
