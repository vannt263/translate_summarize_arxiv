    "the quark model has been extremely successful in accounting for the observed meson and baryon states and their quantum numbers . ground ",
    "state baryons are grouped into an octet * 8 * and a decuplet * 10 * with total angular momentum @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the successful prediction of the @xmath11 and of its mass @xcite and its subsequent experimental discovery @xcite was a cornerstone in establishing su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the pattern of excited baryons was understood in terms of three quarks obeying the pauli principle ( see , e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the discovery of the j/@xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite families gave final support to the quark model .",
    "the development of qcd as renormalizable field theory @xcite and the observation of the partonic structure of nucleons in deep inelastic scattering @xcite seemed to pave the way for an eventual understanding of the structure of hadronic matter .",
    "a completely different approach to understand the nucleon was proposed by skyrme@xcite .",
    "he suggested that the low - energy behaviour of nucleons can be viewed as spherically symmetric soliton solution of the pion field . in this view , the baryonic nature of the nucleon is not due to quarks carrying baryon quantum number @xmath14 .",
    "instead , the baryon number is interpreted as topological quantum number of the pion field @xcite .",
    "a fascinating consequence of this view is the prediction of an anti",
    " decuplet @xmath15 .",
    "it contains a state with exotic quantum numbers , with strangeness @xmath16 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "walliser estimated the mass of this exotic state to be at about 1700mev @xcite .",
    "_ assigned the @xmath17 to the non - strange member of the anti  decuplet thus fixing the mass of the exotic @xmath0 to 1530mev @xcite , a value consistent with the prediction of weigel one year later @xcite . due to its intrinsic strangeness and low mass ,",
    "the only allowed strong  interaction decay modes of the @xmath0 are @xmath2 and @xmath18 .",
    "its width is predicted to be narrow . in quark models",
    ", the @xmath0 has a minimal quark content @xmath19 and is called pentaquark . in the soliton model , it is the lowest  mass state beyond the conventional octet and decuplet baryons .",
    "a recent survey can be found in @xcite .",
    "these predictions stimulated an active search for the @xmath0 . at spring-8(leps ) , a @xmath20 @xmath2 peak was reported in the reaction @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "cuts were applied to select quasi ",
    "free processes on the neutron .",
    "after correction for the fermi momentum , the mass was determined to @xmath22mev . the observed width was compatible with the instrumental resolution .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath23mev was derived .",
    "the diana collaboration at itep @xcite reported a @xmath24 enhancement produced in low - energy @xmath25xe collisions , with @xmath26mev and a statistical significance of @xmath27 .    at jlab ,",
    "a significant @xmath0 peak was observed with the clas detector in the exclusive reaction @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath0 is photoproduced off the neutron and subsequently decays into @xmath2 . only in case of @xmath29 rescattering ,",
    "the proton received sufficient momentum to be detected ; the neutron was identified by the missing mass @xcite .",
    "the peak in the @xmath2 mass distribution had a statistical significance of @xmath30 ; it was found at a mass of @xmath31mev , its width was compatible with the resolution ( fwhm = 21mev ) .",
    "the authors did not see a peak in the @xmath6 mass distribution .",
    "since the clas acceptance for @xmath6 is not the same as that for @xmath2 , they cautiously suggested the @xmath0 should have isospin zero . a preliminary study of the @xmath32 final state produced by photoproduction off protons by the clas collaboration @xcite suggests a @xmath33 peak in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution recoiling ( in the centre  of  mass system ) against a @xmath34 .    in this letter we present evidence for the @xmath0 in photoproduction of the @xmath1 final state off protons .",
    "a diagram which may contribute is shown in fig . [ diag1 ] .",
    "the reaction @xmath35 was measured with the saphir detector @xcite at elsa .",
    "saphir is a magnetic spectrometer covering a solid angle of approximately @xmath36 and the full polar range @xmath37 .",
    "the elsa electron beam produced photons via bremsstrahlung in a copper foil radiator .",
    "the energies of the scattered electrons were determined in the tagging system for photon energies from 31% to 94% of the incident electron energy which was 2.8 gev for the data presented in this letter .",
    "the photon beam passed through a liquid hydrogen target ( 3 cm in diameter and 8 cm in length ) .",
    "interacting photons were detected in a photon counter .",
    "the coincidences of tagger and photon counter determined the photon flux .",
    "the target was located in the centre of a central drift chamber with 14 cylindrical layers .",
    "charged particles leaving the target were bent in the field of a c - shaped magnet allowing for a measurement of momentum and sign of charge .",
    "the momentum resolution @xmath38 for 300mev / c particles in the central drift chamber was approximately 2.5% .",
    "in forward direction a planar drift chamber improved the momentum resolution to about @xmath39% .",
    "the central drift chamber was surrounded by a scintillator wall to measure the time of flight ( tof ) .",
    "the minimum momentum to detect tracks of charged pions and protons was 50 and 150 mev / c , respectively , with a track detection threshold depending on the position of the production vertex in the target .",
    "the data presented here were taken in 1997 and 1998 with a trigger requiring at least two charged particles .",
    "about @xmath40 events were recorded .",
    "the data were used to determine cross sections for photoproduction of strange mesons and baryons @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and of @xmath41 @xcite , @xmath42 @xcite , and @xmath43 @xcite mesons .",
    "we observe the @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath45 the neutron is identified in a kinematical fit using one constraint ; the neutron momentum is reconstructed from energy and momentum conservation .",
    "2a shows the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution after cuts explained below .",
    "a clear signal is observed at @xmath46mev above a smooth background .",
    "the fit ascribes @xmath47 events ( @xmath3 ) to the peak . by counting the four bins around the @xmath0 centre we get 55 events above background and 56 below , corresponding to a statistical significance of @xmath48 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ pic : plusplus ]",
    "the number of @xmath49 events we expect depends on the isospin : clebsch  gordan coefficients favour @xmath49 over @xmath44 by a factor 3 ( for i=2 ) or 4 ( for i=1 ) while the @xmath49 does not exist in case of i=0 .",
    "experimentally , the final state @xmath50 offers an additional factor 3 since 1/2 of all @xmath51 are produced as @xmath52 and escape undetected , and the @xmath53 is observed only with a fraction @xmath54 . in case",
    "the @xmath44 is an isovector or isotensor we should observe 9 or 12 times more @xmath49 events , respectively . also , the saphir acceptance is considerably larger for the fully constrained @xmath55 events .",
    "we thus expect a peak with more than 5000 @xmath49 in fig . 4 ( right ) , far above the observed level .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath44 is isoscalar .",
    "we have studied photoproduction of the @xmath1 final state . in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution",
    "we observe a @xmath3 peak at a mass of @xmath4mev .",
    "the peak is strikingly narrow : we quote an upper limit ( at 90% c.l . ) of @xmath56mev .",
    "mass and width are compatible with results obtained elsewhere . here , the @xmath0 is observed for the first time in the reaction @xmath57 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath58 in the photon energy range from 1.7 to 2.6gev is of similar size as the cross section for @xmath59 photoproduction and smaller by a factor 4 than for other final states with open strangeness like @xmath60 , @xmath61 , or @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath0 has strangeness @xmath16 and can not be a three - quark baryon . in the quark picture , it is a pentaquark @xmath63 . in the related reaction @xmath7 ,",
    "we have searched for a doubly charged isospin partner of the @xmath0 . from the absence of a signal at the expected strength",
    "we deduce that the @xmath0 is an isoscalar .",
    "we would like to thank the technical staff of the elsa machine group for their invaluable contributions to the experiment .",
