    "transitions between fine - structure sublevels in atomic hydrogen have never been detected astronomically . with advances in radio astronomy , however , it now appears that transitions between the @xmath0 and @xmath9 , and @xmath0 and @xmath10 levels may soon be observable in hii regions .",
    "figure 1 shows the fine and hyperfine structure of the @xmath6 level of atomic hydrogen .",
    "the fine structure splitting into the @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 levels is caused by a combination of spin orbit coupling , relativistic effects and the lamb shift .",
    "significantly , the @xmath0 state is metastable owing to the transition rules for angular momentum , i.e. the @xmath5@xmath12 transition is forbidden .",
    "hydrogen atoms in the interstellar medium are removed from the @xmath0 state principally through 2-photon emission to the ground state ( breit and teller 1940 ) with decay rate per atom , @xmath13 ( spitzer and greenstein 1951 ) , resulting in optical continuum radiation .",
    "because this rate is some eight orders of magnitude slower than lyman decay , it may seem reasonable to expect that the @xmath0 state will be overpopulated relative to other excited states under photoionization equilibrium .",
    "it must be noted , however , that trapped lyman-@xmath2 radiation in an hii region will pump the @xmath1 states .",
    "in addition , in dense hii regions collisions , primarily with ions , will transfer hydrogen atoms between the @xmath5 and @xmath1 states .",
    "these effects must be taken into account in order to determine the expected strengths and signs ( absorption versus stimulated emission ) of the @xmath0-@xmath9 ( 1.1 ghz ) and @xmath0-@xmath11 ( 9.9 ghz ) lines .    apparently , @xcite was one of the first to investigate the astrophysical implications of these lines , suggesting that the @xmath0-@xmath11 line might be observed in the sun .",
    "@xcite , however , noted that collisions in the dense solar atmosphere would equilibrate the @xmath5 and @xmath1 populations making detection unlikely .",
    "@xcite suggested that an overpopulation of the metastable @xmath5 states may lead to detectable lines in the interstellar medium .",
    "@xcite raised the possibility of lyman-@xmath2 pumping of the @xmath1 states but discounted its sufficiency for producing observable @xmath14 transitions .",
    "@xcite argued that the lyman-@xmath2 depth in hii regions is essentially infinite such that virtually all downward lyman-@xmath2 transitions are balanced by a lyman-@xmath2 absorption , resulting in an overpopulation of @xmath1 states relative to @xmath5 at densities below about @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite further considered the case in which lyman-@xmath2 radiation is effectively destroyed by collisional conversion of @xmath1 states to @xmath5 ( followed by 2-photon decay to the ground state ) .",
    "the consequent overpopulation of @xmath1 states then led to the prediction that the 9.9 ghz lines would appear in stimulated emission in hii regions .",
    "( this also implied that the 1.1 ghz lines would appear in absorption . )",
    "@xcite used the haystack 37-m radiotelescope with a 16-channel filter bank spanning 1 ghz in frequency to search for the 9.9 ghz lines , but did not find any lines in excess of 0.1 k antenna temperature .",
    "@xcite estimated the strengths of both sets of lines in orion a and w3(oh ) under the assumption that the @xmath1 states are negligibly populated with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "the major variation in the predictions arises from the uncertain density of lyman-@xmath2 radiation in hii regions , which in turn is determined by the processes that destroy lyman-@xmath2 radiation .",
    "in addition to the conversion of @xmath1 to @xmath5 states via collisions , other processes are likely to be important .",
    "resonantly scattered lyman-@xmath2 photons undergo a diffusion in frequency and may thus acquire a significant probability of escaping the hii region due the much lower optical depth in the line wings @xcite .",
    "systematic gas motions within the region ( e.g. expansion ) can also contribute to the migration of lyman-@xmath2 photons away from line center .",
    "the dominant removal mechanism , however , is absorption by dust within the hii region @xcite .",
    "this last fact greatly simplifies the estimation of the lyman-@xmath2 density .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain formulae for the @xmath5 and @xmath1 populations in an hii region under a parameterization that characterizes the rate of @xmath1 production by lyman-@xmath2 absorption in terms of the rate of @xmath1 production through recombination ( section 2 ) .",
    "existing models for dust in hii regions and planetary nebulae are then used to place tight constraints on the lyman-@xmath2 density and thus the @xmath1 production rate by lyman-@xmath2 photons ( section 3 ) . the radiative transfer problem for the fine structure lines is then solved for a uniform region ( section 4 ) .",
    "we obtain approximate predicted line strengths for various hii regions , compact components , and planetary nebulae under the justified assumption that lyman-@xmath2 pumping of the @xmath1 states is negligible ( section 5 ) .",
    "high emission measure hii regions and/or planetary nebulae are most likely to yield detectable lines .",
    "@xcite estimated that between 0.30 and 0.35 of all recombinations in an hii region reach the @xmath5 state . including the effects of collisions and the 2-photon decay rate , the rate equation for the @xmath5 state is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fraction of recombinations producing the @xmath5 state and @xmath2 is the recombination coefficient .",
    "the collision coefficients , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , give the appropriate rates at which atoms are transferred from @xmath1 to @xmath5 and from @xmath5 to @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "these rates are dominated by collisions with protons , but including electron collisions ( and assuming that @xmath21 and @xmath22 k ) , we have @xmath23 @xmath24 s@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath26 is much greater than the energy separations between the @xmath5 and @xmath1 states , the reverse rate is determined by just the ratio of statistical weights , i.e. @xmath27    similar considerations apply to the @xmath1 states .",
    "the fraction of recombinations reaching @xmath1 is @xmath28 .",
    "[ it is worth noting that processes such as lyman-@xmath29 absorption , which ultimately produce the @xmath5 state through @xmath30 , have already been taken into account in the calculation of @xmath18 @xcite . ]",
    "radiative decay occurs through both spontaneous lyman-@xmath2 emission ( with @xmath31 sec@xmath25 ) , as well as stimulated emission .",
    "we must also include radiative excitation from the ground state via lyman-@xmath2 absorption . including collisions which couple to the @xmath5 states ,",
    "the rate equation for @xmath1 then is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the densities of atoms in the @xmath12 and @xmath1 states per radial velocity interval , measured in frequency units ; and @xmath35 is the photon density per frequency interval ( in @xmath16 hz@xmath25 ) .",
    "now , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lyman-@xmath2 frequency , and @xmath38 is the lorentz line profile . for a thermal gas , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the doppler width . for @xmath22",
    "k , @xmath41 hz . clearly thermal widths will completely dominate the natural ( lorentz ) line width of lyman-@xmath2 , and thus we can replace @xmath38 by the dirac delta function .",
    "we then obtain for the absorption term : @xmath42 of course , a similar calculation can be carried out for the stimulated emission term .    because the nebula is optically thick in lyman-@xmath2",
    ", @xmath43 must be considered carefully . were escape from the nebula the primary removal mechanism ,",
    "then a steady state would result in which photons are created near line center , diffuse in frequency through resonant scattering and are effectively removed far out in the wings .",
    "the decrease in both creation rate and diffusion rate with frequency offset results in a nearly flat distribution ( @xmath43 ) out to the approximate frequency at which photons freely escape , beyond which it drops sharply @xcite .",
    "we write this frequency offset as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a dimensionless parameter expressing the offset in terms of the doppler width .",
    "we shall therefore assume that @xmath46 $ ] for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the density of lyman-@xmath2 photons .",
    "the @xmath1 rate equation then becomes @xmath51 spontaneous emission completely dominates the depopulation of the @xmath1 state and thus the other two terms that appeared on the right hand side of equation ( 3 ) have been dropped .",
    "stimulated emission is negligible in comparison with spontaneous emission for any reasonable value of @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , equality of spontaneous and stimulated emission would imply a radiation pressure ( due to lyman-@xmath2 ) many orders of magnitude in excess of the thermal gas pressure . also , the @xmath52 collision rate is negligible for any reasonable value of @xmath53 .",
    "[ we include these collisions terms insofar as they populate the @xmath5 state , however .",
    "see equation ( 1 ) . ]    as we shall see , it is quite plausible that lyman-@xmath2 photons are absorbed by dust before significant frequency diffusion occurs . in this case",
    "@xmath43 will simply reflect the thermal distribution of atoms .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 rate equation is identical to that given above provided we replace @xmath54 with @xmath55 .    at low densities , lyman-@xmath2 photons",
    "are created at the rate at which recombinations lead to @xmath1 states , i.e. @xmath56 . at high densities ( @xmath57 @xmath16 ) @xmath5 states may be collisionally converted to @xmath1 states leading to additional lyman-@xmath2 photons , and thus the lyman-@xmath2 creation rate could be as large as @xmath58 , the total recombination rate .",
    "we therefore define the lyman-@xmath2 lifetime as @xmath59 where @xmath60 . since @xmath1 states decay to the ground state much faster than they could be collisionally converted to @xmath5 , all recombinations to @xmath1",
    "are regarded as producing a lyman-@xmath2 photon .",
    "thus , @xmath61 could never be smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "we define @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the total hydrogen density ( atomic plus ionized ) .",
    "the rate equations [ ( 1 ) and ( 8) ] can then be solved for the @xmath5 and @xmath1 populations : @xmath66 } \\over{a_{21}(a_{2\\gamma } + c_{sp}n_i)-c_{sp}c_{ps}n_i^2}}\\ ] ] @xmath67 } \\over{a_{21}(a_{2\\gamma } + c_{sp}n_i)-c_{sp}c_{ps}n_i^2 } } .\\ ] ] the dimensionless parameter @xmath68 gives the rate at which @xmath1 states are produced by captured lyman-@xmath2 radiation in terms of the @xmath1 creation rate from recombination ( at low densities ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath69 provides a determination of the relative importance of lyman-@xmath2 pumping of the @xmath1 states and whether a fine structure line is expected to appear in absorption or ( stimulated ) emission .",
    "if @xmath70 , then the 9.9 ghz , @xmath0-@xmath11 line will appear in emission , and the 1.1 ghz , @xmath0-@xmath9 line will appear in absorption .",
    "of course , @xmath71 implies the opposite .",
    "( this assumes that the two @xmath1 states are populated according to their relative statistical weights . to evaluate cases in which @xmath69 is of order unity",
    ", it would be necessary to separately account for the rates at which @xmath9 and @xmath11 states are created and destroyed , including the collisional rates coupling these states . ) from equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) it follows that @xmath70 if @xmath72 where , @xmath73 ( the numerical value of @xmath74 corresponds to @xmath75 . ) because the @xmath1 states naturally decay about @xmath76 times faster than the @xmath5 states , population equality thus requires a pumping rate some 8 orders of magnitude faster than the approximate rate at which @xmath5 and @xmath1 states are formed through recombination .",
    "determination of the lyman-@xmath2 density in hii regions is a complicated transfer problem .",
    "it is likely , however , that the dominant mechanism for removing lyman-@xmath2 photons is quite straightforward , i.e. absorption by dust @xcite .",
    "thus , we eschew the noncoherent radiative transfer problem and find the upper limits to @xmath77 and @xmath68 set by absorption .",
    "other competing removal processes would reduce the lifetime , and therefore density , of lyman-@xmath2 photons , resulting in a lower value for @xmath68 .    using a silicate - graphite model for dust in hii regions @xcite , with a dust - to - gas ratio of 0.009",
    ", the extinction at lyman-@xmath2 can be shown to be @xmath78 mag , where @xmath79 is the column density of hydrogen .",
    "the albedo for this mixture is about 0.4 at lyman-@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of lyman-@xmath2 photons against absorption by dust can then be calculated as @xmath80 .",
    "we then find that @xmath81 since @xmath82 throughout most of the volume of an hii region @xcite , we conclude that @xmath83 and that the @xmath5 state is overpopulated relative to the @xmath1 states .    in the harsh environments of planetary nebulae dust might be destroyed by shocks or hard uv radiation , or possibly separated from the ionized gas by radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "abundance measurements indicate , however , that various heavy elements are depleted from the gas phase in the ionized regions of ngc 7027 @xcite and ngc 6445 @xcite , suggesting that dust has not been destroyed in significant quantities .",
    "additionally , planetary nebulae frequently exhibit a mid - ir spectral component characteristic of warm dust heated by the intense radiation field within the ionized region @xcite . summarizing these results ,",
    "@xcite has argued that dust is a common constituent of the ionized zones of planetary nebulae , albeit with dust - to - gas ratios about an order of magnitude or more below that of the general ism .",
    "@xcite has modeled ngc7027 and finds an extinction optical depth of about 0.17 at 500.7 nm . for a uniform model",
    "the column density of hydrogen in the ionized zone is about @xmath84 @xmath85 @xcite , along the radius of the nebula . for the graphite dust model used by @xcite the extinction at lyman-@xmath2",
    "then is @xmath86 mag ; about a factor of 20 smaller than that in a general hii region described above , and roughly consistent with the smaller dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath87 ) in this object @xcite . for an albedo of 0.4 ,",
    "the lyman-@xmath2 lifetime is @xmath88 , and thus @xmath89 if we assume that absorption by dust is the dominant process limiting the lyman-@xmath2 density , make the replacement @xmath90 , and let @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 .",
    "since it is quite unlikely that @xmath93 is as large as 0.05 , as required for @xmath94 , we conclude also in this case that the @xmath1 states are underpopulated relative to the @xmath5 states .    of course , the above estimates are upper limits to the lyman-@xmath2 lifetime , as other processes ( described in section 1 ) may contribute to the removal of these photons .",
    "thus , values of @xmath68 estimated in this way are upper limits . in addition , if escape is important then the relevant value of @xmath95 would be smaller than that substituted above .",
    "it should also be noted that lyman-@xmath2 radiation contributes to heating the dust in the ionized region . the energy absorbed is then reradiated in the ir . in the case of ngc 7027",
    "a mid - ir spectral component is evidently due to dust with temperature @xmath96 k comixed with the ionized gas @xcite . if the heating is dominated by lyman-@xmath2 radiation , then @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the absorption efficiency at lyman-@xmath2 and @xmath99 is the planck - averaged emissivity @xcite , a function of grain size @xmath100 and temperature @xmath101 .",
    "large grains , being efficient emitters in the ir , will yield a larger estimate of @xmath50 . thus",
    ", we assume 1 @xmath102 m graphite grains for which @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath105 we then find @xmath106 where we have taken @xmath107 ( since the fraction of atoms in excited , bound states is negligible ) . to obtain the numerical value given above we used the recombination coefficient in the density bounded case with @xmath22 k @xcite .",
    "assuming lyman-@xmath2 radiation is primarily removed through absorption by dust ( in which case @xmath95 is replaced by @xmath55 ) , then @xmath108 unless @xmath93 exceeds @xmath109 , which is unlikely @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that other sources , such as continuum radiation , are likely important in heating the dust , thereby reducing further the implied value of @xmath50 ( and therefore @xmath68 ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath110 m grain size assumed here is probably an overestimate implying that @xmath50 is also overestimated .",
    "evidently , the @xmath5 state is overpopulated relative to @xmath1 , thus the fine structure transitions will proceed from @xmath0 to @xmath11 via absorption and to @xmath9 via stimulated emission .",
    "although the @xmath1 populations are probably negligible , they will be included in the radiative transfer calculation .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 states between @xmath9 and @xmath11 may deviate somewhat from the statistical weights ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively ) , in part because the separate collisional rates from @xmath5 are not proportional to the statistical weights . since the @xmath1 population is most likely negligible , a detailed calculation of the distribution between @xmath9 and @xmath11 states",
    "will not be carried out here .",
    "rather , the fractional populations of @xmath9 and @xmath11 will be parameterized as @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",

    "the fine structure transitions are allowed electric dipole transitions and the corresponding rates may be computed in a straightforward manner @xcite , giving @xmath117 sec@xmath25 ( @xmath0@xmath9 ) and @xmath118 sec@xmath25 ( @xmath11@xmath0 ) .",
    "the absorption coefficient ( valid for either transition ) is @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the degeneracy of the final state ( 2 for @xmath9 , 4 for @xmath11 ; @xmath121 ) .",
    "the @xmath122 sign corresponds to transitions to @xmath9 ; the @xmath123 sign to transitions to @xmath11 , and @xmath29 is either @xmath124 or @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "either final state quickly decays to the ground state via lyman-@xmath2 with rate @xmath126 .",
    "the natural line width of the @xmath5@xmath1 transitions is therefore dominated by the rapid decay of the @xmath1 state and is @xmath127 mhz . for a lorentzian profile , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is",
    "either @xmath130 or @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the frequency of the fine structure transition . from equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) we find @xmath133 where we have assumed that the lyman decay rate @xmath126 always dominates the collision rate @xmath134 .",
    "the absorption coefficient at line center then is @xmath135 this will be scaled according to the free - free absorption coefficient @xcite , @xmath136 the ratio of the line optical depth ( at line center ) , @xmath137 , to the free - free continuum optical depth , @xmath138 , then is @xmath139 where @xmath140 sec@xmath25 for the @xmath7 transition and @xmath141 sec@xmath25 for the @xmath8 transition .",

    "( see also ershov 1987 . )",
    "the @xmath15 k microwave radiation field is not sufficient to overcome the rates described in section 2 and thus it can not establish equilibrium . for example , in the likely case where @xmath152 , the @xmath1 levels are drained by lyman-@xmath2 emission faster than the microwave radiation field can return these states to @xmath5 via either absorption or stimulated emission .",

    "the 9.9 ghz transitions are intrinsically about three orders of magnitude stronger than the 1.1 ghz transitions .",
    "the solution to the radiative transfer equation indicates that , in general , the line brightness temperature @xmath153 grows as the square of the free - free optical depth in the optically thin limit ( equation 28 ) .",
    "one factor comes from the growth of free - free emission , which effectively forms the  background \" , and the other from the proportionate growth of the line absorption . in the optically thick limit , the growth in line temperature saturates ( equation 29 ) .",
    "most hii regions of interest are optically thin at 9.9 ghz and optically thick at 1.1 ghz . in general , the higher optical depth at 1.1 ghz does not significantly offset the relative weakness of these transitions .",

    "the estimates in table 1 take into account the distribution of the line strength over three hyperfine components making up each fine structure line and the consequent line blending . at 9.9 ghz ,",
    "the strongest line ( 9876 mhz ) will be blended with the weakest line ( 9853 mhz ) .",
    "the peak temperature occurs at 9874 mhz and is 75% of that calculated using equation 26 for a single ( fictitious ) fine structure line",
    ". the 10030 mhz line will be somewhat distinct with a peak temperature equal to 32% of that predicted from equation 26 , including contributions from the wings of the 9852 and 9876 mhz lines .",
    "the situation at 1.1 ghz is similar .",
    "the 1088 mhz line will appear blended with the 1147 mhz line , with a peak value of 63% at 1093 mhz .",
    "the 910 mhz line will remain distinct with a peak value of 30% , including line wing contributions from the other two lines .",
    "the estimates in table 1 give the line temperature at the peak of the brightest spectral feature in either the 9.9 ghz or 1.1 ghz blended multiplet . at both frequencies , the resulting profile of a strong blended feature and a distinct weaker line , combined with lorentzian line shapes , will provide a unique detection signature .",
    "figure 2 shows the predicted appearance of the blended multiplet around 9.9 ghz .",
    "the green bank telescope ( gbt ) provides a realistic hope of detection of the 9.9 ghz lines . having a clear aperture it should be relatively free of standing waves in the antenna structure .",
    "thus , it should be possible to search for very broad spectral features over bandpasses as large as 800 mhz . nevertheless , the high emission measure hii regions that are likely to show the lines are typically quite compact .",
    "therefore , the estimated line antenna temperatures @xmath158 include the effects of dilution in the @xmath159 gbt beam .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath160 at 1.1 ghz were calculated using either the @xmath161 gbt beam ( subscript @xmath162 ) , or where appropriate , the arecibo @xmath163 beam ( subscript @xmath129 ) .",
    "quite possibly the observational sensitivity will be limited by systematic effects in which the continuum antenna temperature is modulated by frequency dependent gain variations which are not entirely removed by calibration procedures .",
    "thus the limiting factor may be the line - to - continuum ratio , @xmath164 , which is also tabulated for both lines .",
    "the estimates given in table 1 are only approximate .",

    "are present on a range of scales , down to very high emission measure arc - second scale components @xcite .",
    "the components included in the table ( typically a few tens of arc seconds in size ) were selected because they contribute significantly to the total flux in the gbt beam .",
    "the more compact , arc - second scale components typically yield larger values of @xmath164 ( despite densities @xmath165 @xmath16 and consequent collisional de - excitation ) , yet they tend to contribute relatively little to the total flux in the gbt beam .",
    "conversely , extended , low emission measure components in the beam will add to the antenna temperature while contributing little line absorption .",
    "it should also be noted that the presence of structures having a wide range of densities implies that the uniform model considered in section 4 is an oversimplification .",
    "inhomogeneous structure , including clumping , in the emission regions would imply that the emission measure estimates in table 1 represent an average over the surface of the source . in the optically thin case , i.e. most sources at 9.9 ghz , a redistribution of emission measure , and therefore optical depth , will tend to strengthen the overall estimated line strength @xmath153 due to its @xmath166-dependence ( equation 28 ) .",
    "collisional de - excitation in denser regions of the source , however , will tend to reduce the line optical depth ( equation 24 ) .",
    "because @xmath157 is density dependent , particularly for densities above about @xmath167 @xmath16 , the brightness temperature for a homogeneous source ( equation 26 ) can not be rescaled using some weighted optical depth ; rather , detailed modeling would be required .",
    "three high emission measure planetary nebulae are also included in the table ( ic 418 , ngc 7027 , and ngc 6572 ) .",
    "these objects tend to have somewhat simpler structure than the more complex hii regions .",
    "nevertheless , ngc 7027 has a well documented shell structure . in this case , a number of emission line diagnostics indicate @xmath168 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "subarcsecond radio images show that the emission originates from a shell with a peak emission measure of about @xmath169 pc @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "both results are consistent with an area filling factor of about 30% , with characteristic emission measure of about @xmath171 pc @xmath170 .",
    "the higher emission measure boosts the line - to - continuum ratio , whereas the higher density acts oppositely due to collisional de - excitation .",
    "the net result in this case is a somewhat stronger estimated line with @xmath172 .",
    "this case is worked out in table 1 as \\{ngc 7027}@xmath173 , and depicted in figure 2 .",
    "generally , compact , high emission measure objects tend to give stronger line - to - continuum ratios , despite their higher densities ( which result in collisional de - excitation ) .",
    "this is because hii regions tend to be loosely organized along domains of constant excitation parameter @xmath174 @xcite . using size @xmath175 as a free parameter , then @xmath176 . for @xmath177 pc @xmath170 ,",
    "the hii region is optically thin at 9.9 ghz and , for @xmath154 @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "thus , in the low density limit ( @xmath181 ) the line - to - continuum ratio grows in direct proportion to @xmath155 , and therefore to @xmath182 for fixed @xmath174 .",
    "of course , the most compact objects have densities in excess of @xmath183 , in which case the line - to - continuum ratio increases with @xmath184 for fixed @xmath174 , since @xmath185 . for emission measures above @xmath186 pc @xmath170",
    "an hii region becomes optically thick at 9.9 ghz and the advantage of increased emission measure is lost . in such cases , higher densities will reduce the line - to - continuum ratio .    as discussed above ,",
    "the 1.1 ghz lines are considerably weaker . under the most favorable conditions of high free - free optical depth and low density , we find",
    "@xmath187 assuming , as discussed above , that @xmath188 .",
    "these conditions are not uncommon and exceptionally high emission measures are not required to achieve high optical depth at 1.1 ghz . in the case of m 42 the optical depth at 1.1 ghz is 1.2 and the beam diluted line strength would be about 4 mk , versus a continuum antenna temperature of @xmath189 400 k.",
    "the metastable @xmath0 state of hydrogen is likely overpopulated in hii regions .",
    "lyman-@xmath2 pumping of the @xmath1 states is expected to be negligible due to absorption of lyman-@xmath2 radiation by dust .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 transitions ( 9.9 ghz ) are predicted to appear in absorption and the @xmath7 transitions ( 1.1 ghz ) in stimulated emission .",
    "because of the short lifetime of the final @xmath1 states , the width of the lines is dominated completely by intrinsic line width . in effect , then , the power is distributed over @xmath190 mhz of line width resulting in very weak lines . in addition , the power is distributed over three strongly blended hyperfine lines in each multiplet .    searching for the 9.9 ghz lines in high emission measure hii regions offers the best prospects for detection . in the optically thin limit , the line strength varies as the square of the free - free optical depth . predicted line - to - continuum ratios ( in absorption ) range up to several tenths of a percent in w58a , including the effects of line blending . with the green bank telescope ,",
    "the predicted peak absorption line strength may reach @xmath191 mk in this case , allowing for the redistribution of line strength over the three hyperfine lines .",
    "other high emission hii regions are expected to show somewhat weaker 9.9 ghz lines , for example , with line - to - continuum ratios of about 0.1 percent and line strengths of tens of mk with the green bank telescope .",
    "these predictions are uncertain , however , owing to biases inherent in estimating emission measures as well as selection effects in various interferometric surveys of compact hii regions .",
    "these conclusions apply to thermal sources .",
    "an important extension of this work would consider the broad line regions of active galactic nuclei and quasars in which a strong nonthermal microwave radiation field could influence the populations of the @xmath5 and @xmath1 levels , as well as provide a background for line absorption or stimulated emission .    in general , detection of the fine structure lines of hydrogen",
    "will be challenging due to the extraordinary line width and blended structure .",
    "the observations will require meticulous baseline calibration and subtraction .",
