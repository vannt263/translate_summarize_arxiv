    "the hamiltonian formalism has been successfully applied to the description of a variety of field theories , among others the euler equations for ideal fluids , the maxwell equations , and the korteweg - de vries equation ( see @xcite for a historical survey ) .",
    "most of these efforts have been directed towards field theories defined on a manifold without boundary , for which a comprehensive theory of poisson brackets , symmetry reduction and stability analysis exists .    from the point of view of control and interconnection , it is more natural to consider _ open _ systems @xcite , and more specifically field theories with varying boundary conditions .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , non - zero energy flow through the boundary causes the usual poisson operator in hamilton s equation to be no longer skew - symmetric , so that these system fall outside the scope of the traditional hamiltonian framework .",
    "these difficulties were circumvented in @xcite by means of a certain notion of infinite - dimensional dirac structure called a _ stokes - dirac structure _ , whose hamiltonian equations allow for a non - zero energy flux through the boundary .",
    "dirac structures @xcite arise naturally in the modeling of a range of mechanical systems ( see @xcite and @xcite for an overview ) . in the case of stokes - dirac structures ,",
    "this description is extended by describing the underlying field theory in terms of _ differential forms_. stokes theorem then ensures that boundary energy flow is properly incorporated .",
    "while stokes - dirac structure have proven to be successful in describing a variety of control - theoretic systems , they are as of yet not fully understood .",
    "the foundational paper @xcite offers a definition of a stokes - dirac structure , but this description often has to be augmented to accommodate specific examples such as euler s equations for a compressible fluid .",
    "the aims and achievements of this paper are twofold . in the first part of the paper , we consider field theories",
    "whose configuration space @xmath0 is a space of forms , on which a symmetry group @xmath1 acts which is again a space of forms .",
    "we start from the canonical dirac structure on @xmath2 and perform symmetry reduction .",
    "we then show that the resulting reduced dirac structure is precisely a stokes - dirac structure in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this procedure by means of the telegrapher s equations , maxwell s equations , and the equations for a vibrating string . in the second part of the paper",
    ", we then show that a similar reduction philosophy can be used to derive non - canonical stokes - dirac structures as well .",
    "we demonstrate this by deriving from first principles the stokes - dirac structure for a compressible isentropic fluid .    throughout this paper",
    ", we only treat the case of boundaryless manifolds , a simplification which greatly clarifies the reduction picture .",
    "we return to the issue of boundary conditions at the end of the paper , where we argue how boundary terms can be described by means of extended dual spaces .",
