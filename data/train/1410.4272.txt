    "elliptical galaxies have been known for a long time and constituted one of the main categories of modern galaxy classification .",
    "observationally it is clear that they are in some form of virialized states with surface brightness suiting the well - known de vaucouleurs profile ( @xcite ) . in attempt to answer this , d. lynden - bell introduced the violent relaxation theory ( see @xcite ) which regarded the observed galaxies as meta - stable equilibria resulting from the collisionless relaxation .",
    "this evolution time - scale was notably short so that the protogalaxies were able to attain the stationary states within a few crossing times .",
    "although the theory of lynden - bell was considered to be a milestone for understanding the collisionless dynamics of self - gravitating systems and , more generally , the systems governed by other long - range interactions , it did not provide a satisfactory explanation of how the elliptical galaxies had obtained their shapes . as a consequence the question about the evolutionary background to those observed ellipticities then became the open research topic in galactic astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "current understanding suggests two distinctive formation schemes : merger of galaxies and violently collapsing protogalaxy .",
    "the former scenario has been suggested by @xcite which involved at least two encountering galaxies under mutual gravitational interaction .",
    "it was shown that the final shape after the merger could be elliptical .",
    "numerous merging simulations producing galaxies similar to those from observations were reported ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in the latter scenario , people were focusing on the isolated radially anisotropic system under the gravitational force .",
    "it was long believed that such a system is highly unstable to the deformation of configuration .",
    "the instability was first detected in the pioneering simulation by @xcite , who figured out that under a circumstance where system was dominated by radial motion , the spatial configuration of system was drastically deformed .",
    "similar result was obtained later by @xcite in which , starting from the predominantly radial spherical system , an ellipsoidal core of structure was observed .",
    "these results gave rise to the so - called radial orbit instability ( roi ) , which was originally mentioned by @xcite ( see summary in english in @xcite ) .",
    "for the isotropic system it was known that any distribution function was always stable as long as it was the decreasing function of energy per unit mass ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although the roi theory did not provide any clue on precise stability rule , many subsequent studies were able to determine , semi - analytically or numerically , the criteria at which shape deformation was triggered .",
    "various diagnostics were then proposed .",
    "studies led by @xcite showed that an anisotropic ratio calculated from twice the radial kinetic energy over the tangential kinetic energy was sufficient to evaluate the stability .",
    "each group finished up with different numerical threshold values but they all shared the same conception that large anisotropic ratio increased the chance of shape deformation .",
    "on the other hand , groups of @xcite used an indicator as simple as the initial virial ratio . in the case of sufficiently low initial virial ratio",
    ", it was found that the violently collapsing phase occurred , which was analogous to the radially anisotropic system , and the final shape was considerably changed .",
    "later there was also the report of study using the combination of both parameters ( see @xcite ) . in another aspect",
    ", it was proposed that the instability could be engendered by density contrast from the inhomogeneity of initial density profile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "later the same instability in dissipative systems was also examined by @xcite .",
    "question on intrinsic three - dimensional shape of elliptical galaxies is still unsolved .",
    "it was long believed that elliptical galaxy is oblate due to the flattening about the axis of rotation .",
    "theoretical supports for oblate galaxy could be found in @xcite and also references therein .",
    "an objection was then made based on the observed rotational velocity of galaxies that led to another propositions for prolate galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) and triaxial galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerical works of cold collapse experiments starting from various density profiles ( see @xcite for example ) also produced different results .",
    "they found that the final intrinsic shapes were not unique but they depended strongly on the choices of initial conditions .",
    "however , the investigation on this topic relies mainly on theoretical and numerical approaches due to the observational limitation .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the shape evolution in the cold collapse of isolated self - gravitating system in spherical symmetry .",
    "we are interested in the aspects different from those in the past literatures : what is the role of finite-@xmath0 density fluctuation in the evolution from spherical symmetry and how can we describe , in the quantitative way , its influence on the final shapes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in section [ theory ] , we revisit the dynamical model of cold gravitational collapse of spherical system and derive the estimate of some variables in stationary states as a function of @xmath0 such as the flattening and specific angular momentum . these predictions will be used in comparing with numerical results in further section . in section [ nume ] , we introduce the initial condition and simulation parameters that we employ in this work .",
    "next in section [ results ] , we present the numerical results , focusing mainly on the temporal evolution of systems and their properties in stationary states . some of the results may be compared with theoretical predictions we derived earlier . finally in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we give the conclusion and discussion .",
    "this section describes in detail our theoretical study of spherical cold collapse .",
    "we first recall the dynamical model of this process in continuum limit .",
    "then , we apply the density fluctuation and derive the estimate of some variables in stationary states as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "results from this section will be used in comparing with numerical results in section [ results ] .      consider a spherically symmetric system in continuum limit with uniform density @xmath2 ; the equation of motion of a thin spherical mass shell with radial position @xmath3 at time @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total mass inside @xmath3 . defining the scale factor @xmath7 ,",
    "the equation of motion can be rewritten in terms of @xmath8 as @xmath9 for cold initial state , the integration of equation ( [ eq_motion_r ] ) over @xmath4 gives @xmath10^{1/2 } ,   \\label{eq_velocity}\\ ] ] which describes the infall velocity before the maximum collapse , i.e. when @xmath11 .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ eq_velocity ] ) can be written in parametric form as follows : @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{parametric_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the uniform case , all mass shells will collapse simultaneously into a singularity at the free - fall time , @xmath13 , given by @xmath14    consider now a system of @xmath0 particles ; the local density fluctuation arising from finite @xmath0 makes the free - fall time of each particle scattered around the mean value ( [ t_ff ] ) .",
    "consequently , the dispersion of free - fall time can be written by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the density fluctuation .",
    "then , it can be shown that the dispersion of infall velocity at any @xmath4 can be approximated by @xmath17 the variation of @xmath18 means that the particles having shorter free - fall times will have greater infall velocities .",
    "this implies that with microscopic density fluctuation the gravitational collapse is no longer in perfect singularity at @xmath13 .",
    "the minimal size , @xmath19 , is instead attained which can be scaled with @xmath0 as , following the analysis of @xcite , @xmath20    further from that the finite-@xmath0 effect prevents the collapse to attain the absolute singularity , the velocity dispersion ( [ delta_rdot ] ) also becomes the source of the departure from spherical symmetry in the following manner .",
    "given the particles falling to the origin from all directions with velocity dispersion in equation ( [ delta_rdot ] ) , they will be moving outwards with different velocities .",
    "we speculate that during the process of shape evolution the particles with greater outward velocities tend to expand further and then they are more likely to establish the longer axis . before we start the estimation",
    ", we first suppose that , when the violent relaxation is finished after the cold collapse , the final shape of bound structure is always in ellipsoidal form having three calculable semi - principal axes of lengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . to evaluate the degree of departure from spherical symmetry , we define the flattening @xmath24 as @xmath25 by definition @xmath24 ranges from @xmath26 ( sphere ) to @xmath27 ( thin disc ) .",
    "as it was noticed by @xcite that the determination of system size is significantly sensitive to the choice of the positioning of coordinate frame , we then impose that the calculations of all physical quantities of the stationary structures are fixed on the centre of gravity coordinate .",
    "this is also in correspondence with analysis of numerical results in section [ results ] .    to estimate the flattening of the final shape ,",
    "let us suppose that the permitted relaxation time to the final shape is given by @xmath28 .",
    "we then estimate the semi - major axis length by the distance spanned by a particle with maximum outward velocity , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the maximum infall velocity . for the same reason",
    ", the semi - minor axis length corresponds to @xmath31 the expressions above imply that the key development to triaxiality relies on the dispersion of infall velocity passing at the origin at @xmath13 .",
    "then , we approximate the maximum velocity by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the initial position . if we suppose that @xmath34 , we therefore obtain the estimate of @xmath24 of the stationary states to be @xmath35_{t = t_{ff } } , \\label{estim_iota}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the average .",
    "to explain the approximation ( [ estim_iota ] ) in other words , the origin of flattening comes from the combination of two main factors which are the dispersion of @xmath13 and the mean infall velocity at @xmath13 . replacing the relations ( [ eq_velocity ] ) and ( [ delta_tff ] ) into ( [ estim_iota ] ) and taking @xmath37 , the estimate becomes @xmath38 in the case of uniform density discretized into point - mass system of randomly placed @xmath0 particles ,",
    "the average density fluctuation can be approximated by poissonian noise , i.e. @xmath39 . following the scaling of @xmath19 given by equation ( [ r_min ] ) , the estimate of @xmath24 becomes @xmath40 the scaling ( [ iota_n ] ) implies that the stationary state is less deformed as @xmath0 increases since the density fluctuation triggering the shape evolution is diminished .",
    "note that the advantage of choosing the uniform case is that the density fluctuation is purely that of poisson , which is essentially a function of only @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the estimated flattening of stationary states can be characterized just by a single parameter .",
    "analysis of non - uniform initial condition is more complicated as the density fluctuation does not only come from poissonian noise .",
    "so the prediction might involve more than one parameter .",
    "in general , the violent relaxation of cold initial state is always followed by the process of mass ejection that expels an amount of mass away from the system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the mass of the virialized state is always reduced from that of initial state . in our analysis",
    ", we neglect all ejected particles and only the remaining bound part is in consideration .",
    "we investigate further the generation of angular momentum from cold collapse . given the local density fluctuation , the trajectories of infall particles are meant to deviate from completely radial .",
    "thus , at @xmath13 when the particles pass by the origin , they can gain some rotational component .",
    "in cold non - rotating initial state , we speculate that the angular momentum of relaxed structure is produced by the exchange between the escaping particles and the remaining bound particles during the violent relaxation . the mass ejection is supposed to be asymmetric so that the exchanged angular momentum is not cancelled out .    from equation ( [ eq_velocity ] ) , we can deduce that at @xmath13 the infall velocity diverges in continuum limit .",
    "but if @xmath0 is finite , the same discreteness that prevents the singularity also imposes the limit of the infall velocity .",
    "we estimate the average infall velocity that can be attained at @xmath13 by taking the limit @xmath41 where @xmath37 and we therefore have @xmath42 note that this expression is in line with @xcite .",
    "suppose that the perpendicular distance to the origin of particles is given by @xmath19 , the estimate of accumulated angular momentum of a system composed of @xmath43 bound particles of mass @xmath44 therefore reads @xmath45 to avoid the complexity arising from @xmath0-dependence of @xmath43 , it is more convenient to consider the specific angular momentum @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore obtain the scaling of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath0 following the relations ( [ r_min ] ) and ( [ v_max ] ) as @xmath48 this means that the net rotational motion vanishes in the continuum limit since the evolution is completely radial at all time .",
    "in this study , the initial condition is the sphere of uniform density composed of @xmath0 particles of identical mass where all particles are at rest ( i.e. cold uniform sphere ) . to generate it for any @xmath0",
    ", particles are thrown randomly in a sphere of radius @xmath49 with uniform probability density , i.e. @xmath50 the total mass @xmath51 is fixed to @xmath52 ; thus , the mass of individual particle @xmath44 is equal to @xmath53 .",
    "note that by this choice of parameters , the initial density @xmath2 is always equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the initial potential energy of a sphere is thus @xmath54 here we put @xmath55 for all simulations . for temporal evolution , the time unit is presented in the free - fall time given by @xmath56 in statistical point of view , with @xmath57 , @xmath51 and @xmath49 fixed , it remains only the random microscopic density fluctuation to vary in each realization with mean density contrast decaying with @xmath0 .",
    "to put it simply , if we fix those three parameters , there is only a single parameter that characterizes the initial condition . for convenience",
    "we choose it to be @xmath0 .",
    "this choice is proper when comparing with the theoretical predictions as we derive them in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "equation of motion of each particle is integrated using gadget-2 code in public version ( see @xcite for guidance ) .",
    "we consider purely self - gravitating system in non - expanding background .",
    "the gravitational force is softened by a spline with adjustable softening length @xmath58 in the way that it converges to newtonian above @xmath58 , but below that length the force is decreasing and vanishes as distance goes to zero ( see @xcite for detail ) . given an initial system size of order @xmath27 , the average inter - particle distance @xmath59 can be approximated by @xmath60 .",
    "we then adjust the softening length as decreasing function of @xmath0 as @xmath61 we choose @xmath58 much smaller than @xmath59 to ensure that the newtonian gravity is well preserved in close encounters during the collapse .",
    "although it was found by @xcite that varying @xmath58 has significant change on the final shapes , our choice of @xmath58 is well below the range where the final shapes are sensitive to it .",
    "we can hereby neglect the dependence on @xmath58 in our study .    in dynamical integration",
    ", the total force on an individual particle is determined by direct summation at each time step .",
    "we separate the simulation into three phases : pre - collapse ( @xmath62 ) , collapse ( @xmath63 ) and post - collapse ( after @xmath64 ) . during each phase",
    ", the integration time step is fixed .",
    "the time steps for pre - collapse and collapse , where the maximum contraction occurs , are controlled to be around @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . in post - collapse , it varies from @xmath67 to @xmath68 so that , in all realizations , the error on total energy is less than @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 at the end of simulations .",
    "the numerical simulations are performed for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 different realizations , respectively .",
    "all simulations are terminated at @xmath84 at first , with prolongation to @xmath85 for a few selected cases with @xmath86 and @xmath78 for specific inquiry . here",
    ", the system of @xmath0 which is not too large is preferred in order to preserve the statistical effect from density fluctuation that diminishes substantially with @xmath0 .",
    "we overcome the anticipated uncertainty arising in small @xmath0 system by the ensemble average over considerable number of realizations if necessary .      [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for more quantitative examination , the plot of ensemble - averaged @xmath87 with error bars as a function of @xmath0 from the @xmath88 per cent bound mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_l100 ] , taken at the same time slices as above .",
    "error bars are determined in the similar way as for @xmath24 plots .",
    "the @xmath89 best fit from equation ( [ spe_angu ] ) and the @xmath90 best fit giving @xmath91 are provided together . in this plot ,",
    "both fittings are performed with data from three time slices .",
    "we find that the dispersion of angular momentum from three snapshots is low in accordance with the temporal plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_l100 t ] . for the scaling of @xmath87",
    ", we find that the simulated @xmath87 matches better with @xmath92 , albeit with large fluctuation , than the @xmath89 prediction . from this result",
    ", the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath87 might reflect that the initial density fluctuation , which is the only @xmath0-dependent initial factor , is also involved in the generation of angular momentum .",
    "however , our explanation on this physical process is not yet satisfactory . the question considering",
    "the origin of angular momentum is still under investigation .",
    "in this paper , we study the problem of shape evolution in the @xmath0-body self - gravitating system starting from cold uniform sphere .",
    "our main interest is on how well we can describe quantitatively the degree of deviation from spherical symmetry of the virialized structures . to begin with",
    ", we speculate that the origin of shape deformation from spherical symmetry is from the finite-@xmath0 density fluctuation in the way that the deformation increases with the amplitude of that fluctuation . then by revisit of the dynamical model of spherical collapse",
    ", we implement the density fluctuation , which is purely poissonian in our case , into the dynamical evolution and finally obtain the estimate of @xmath24 at stationary states as a function of @xmath0 to be @xmath1 .    in order to analyse the dynamics of shape evolution , the @xmath0-body simulations for various @xmath0 have been performed .",
    "the visual inspection of the stationary state in simulation suggests that the virialized state can be described by the so - called core - halo structure , as depicted by the central dense region ( or core ) loosely surrounded by the diffused region ( or halo ) .",
    "it is subsequently shown that a sub - structure consisting of @xmath93 per cent most bound particles is acceptable to represent the core of the system and , likewise , the @xmath94 per cent most bound mass can also be used without any significant difference . for",
    "the three - dimensional configuration of the stationary states , the temporal plots of @xmath24 reveal the departure from spherical symmetry of the cores during the violent relaxation , and the cores in virialized state can be approximated by ellipsoids with valid three semi - principal axis lengths .",
    "their intrinsic shapes exhibit various degrees of triaxiality and can be categorized into four different types : completely triaxial , prolate , oblate and nearly spherical .",
    "in contrast , when considering the same questions for the entire core - halo system ( i.e. the @xmath88 per cent bound mass ) , the problem is less clarified as the determination of shape is erroneous due to the disturbance from distant particles in the outermost halo .",
    "focusing now on the @xmath0-dependence of the configurations , we find that the cores in simulations tend to be less flattened and their shapes are less diversified as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we find that the predicted @xmath1 scaling of @xmath24 provides reasonably good agreement with the simulated cores in the range of @xmath0 from @xmath95 to @xmath77 , with the extension of simulation required for @xmath86 .",
    "the increase of relaxation time with @xmath0 might manifest the intervention of collisional effect at this stage .",
    "this occurrence could be explained as follows .",
    "for the final state to deviate from the vlasov limit , the scattering with the potential of neighbouring particles , which are distributed asymmetrically in microscopic scale , during close encounter is necessary .",
    "in contrast , the related study led by @xcite observed the opposite results that the @xmath0-dependence was missing for the cases with @xmath96 in various initial conditions . their conclusion may be true in some part as , from our studies on various system parameters for a considerable range of @xmath0 , we find that the @xmath0-dependence behaviour of each parameter differs greatly .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 is apparently free from @xmath0 while the angular momentum exposes clearly the constant decreasing with @xmath0 for more than one order of magnitude ( see more discussion below ) . for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , due to the increasing relaxation time with @xmath0 , this question is more difficult to resolve numerically for larger @xmath0 .",
    "when we look on the temporal plots of flattenings , they reveal obviously a distinguishable process of evolution to the prediction that lasts longer than the virialization .",
    "this secondary stage leads the virialized cores to more spherical , but still triaxial , states with relaxation time diverging with @xmath0 .",
    "the sequential evolutions were also reported by @xcite where the authors demonstrated , using an appropriate measure of axial ratio , that shape evolution could be divided into three main stages : swift relaxation to triaxial configuration within a few @xmath100 , readjustment to axisymmetric within @xmath101 and slow spherization that is continual until hundreds of @xmath100 .",
    "they asserted that the first two stages were in a collisionless regime with time - scale independent of @xmath0 while only the third stage was collisional with time scale increasing with @xmath0 . back to our results ,",
    "the two - step evolution scheme may coincide with their first two steps but we may have different opinions in two points .",
    "first , the underlying physical process of the second step should involve , either partly or fully , the collisionality .",
    "thus , it appears that the collisional effect comes into regulating much earlier than previously thought by them .",
    "secondly the shape after the second step is not necessarily axisymmetric .",
    "it was found that some final shapes ended up in triaxial .",
    "however , because of the limited simulation time in our study , we are not able to verify the third step of evolution .",
    "shape deformation from spherical collapse in an isolated system has also been topic of research earlier by , for example , @xcite for systems with @xmath0 ranging from @xmath102 to @xmath103 with different types of initial conditions , mostly non - uniform .",
    "they found in some cases that significant triaxiality emerged even if @xmath0 was as large as @xmath104 , while according to our conclusion the triaxiality should not remain detectable in such a system .",
    "this unlikeliness can be explained by that they employed the inhomogeneous initial density profiles that yield the density contrast which does not decay with @xmath0 in addition to the poissonian noise .",
    "therefore , the dispersion of free - fall time is greatly enhanced even for very large @xmath0 systems .",
    "some simulations of cold collapse of power - law density profile with size comparable to our @xmath105 system by @xcite yielded considerably a more flattened structure .",
    "their final axial ratio of @xmath106 bound mass was equivalent to @xmath24 between @xmath107 and @xmath108 , depending strongly on the power - law index , which was more flattened than any realization in our study .",
    "however , it remains to be clarified if the same scaling is preserved for other type of initial condition .",
    "this macroscopic initial density contrast is interpreted as a ` seed ' of instability by @xcite which is compulsory in order to develop the highly elongated structures . on the contrary",
    ", they considered the homogeneous case as lacking this seed to progress effectively the shape deformation . from our simulations",
    ", we find that the stable triaxiality still can be developed in homogeneous initial state , though it is milder than the non - homogeneous one in past studies .",
    "thus it turns out to be that the homogeneous case may carry ` weak seed ' , which is of course of microscopic origin and decays with @xmath0 , rather than ` no seed ' as conjectured by them .",
    "in addition , we also examine the establishment of angular momentum of stationary state starting from non - rotating cold initial condition . in past literature",
    ", the generation of angular momentum was mostly related to the tidal - torque theory ( see @xcite ) which involved at least two systems exerting torque to each other . here",
    ", we propose alternatively that the rotation can also be generated in an isolated system by angular momentum exchange between bound and ejected components during the asymmetric mass ejection .",
    "this supposition is verified using numerical simulations that unveil the stable rotation and the @xmath0-dependence of angular momentum at stationary states .",
    "the rotation of relaxed systems constantly slows down when @xmath0 increases .",
    "we also note the short relaxation time of rotation and it is apparently independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence imprinted in the angular momentum is the crucial point which indicates that its origin is somehow related to the initial density fluctuation .",
    "however , the underlying process is not yet understood .",
    "the author fully acknowledges the financial support granted by the faculty of science and technology of the rajamangala university of technology suvarnabhumi as a crucial part in conducting the research .",
    "also useful discussions from michael joyce and francesco sylos labini are grateful ."
