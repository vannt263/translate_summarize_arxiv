    "the quantum theory of relativistic fields with moving boundaries was first explored by moore in a remarkably original paper on the quantum formulation of linearly polarized light in a one - dimensional moving cavity  @xcite .",
    "the primary result of this investigation was the discovery that moving mirrors in vacuum create photons .",
    "later , motivated by developments in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes , the specialization to a single moving mirror in minkowski spacetime was carried out by fulling and davies  @xcite , who again found that non - uniformly accelerating mirrors generate radiation .",
    "these effects , in which particles are produced by moving boundaries , are generally referred to as the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) or the nonstationary casimir effect @xcite .",
    "an experimental verification of the dce in a system with a mechanically moving boundary has remained elusive because of the technological challenges in creating sufficiently large accelerations  @xcite .",
    "however , an experimental observation of a similar particle creation effect has been reported in a mechanically static semiconductor waveguide where the boundary condition on the field is modulated electrically , by a superconducting quantum - interference device ( squid )  @xcite .",
    "a  related experimental observation of particle creation in josephson metamaterial has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "these observations open fascinating prospects for simulating on a mechanically static desktop device quantum phenomena due to motion , including entanglement generation and degradation , in a regime where the moving system would experience significant relativistic effects @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the evolution of a quantum field in waveguides of the type used in the experiment of @xcite in situations where the modulation of the squid(s ) at the end(s ) of the waveguide is small in magnitude but may have arbitrary time - dependence , under the further assumption that the plasma frequency of the squid(s ) is negligibly high compared with the frequencies where the experiment operates .",
    "more precisely , recall that the field @xmath0 in the experiment of @xcite satisfies , under the approximations described in  @xcite , the @xmath1-dimensional klein - gordon equation @xmath2 with the boundary condition @xmath3 where the cavity is at @xmath4 , the squid is at @xmath5 , the meaning of the positive constants @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is as described in  @xcite , and @xmath10 can be given arbitrary time - dependence by modulating the magnetic field applied to the squid . in the regime where the squid s plasma frequency is large compared to the frequency of  @xmath11 ,",
    "the time derivative term in is negligible , and reduces to @xmath12 where @xmath13}^2   { \\bigl[l_0 e_j(t)\\bigr]}^{-1 } $ ] .",
    "we shall consider the regime in which the boundary condition applies and the time - dependence of @xmath14 is arbitrary in profile but small in magnitude .",
    "the regime where the squid s plasma frequency is large but not negligibly so is considered in @xcite .    our interest in the boundary condition is twofold .",
    "first , considering the condition in its own right , we give an explicit solution to the quantum dynamics to leading perturbative order in the time variation of the boundary condition , using a formalism that allows us to handle both the semiopen waveguide and a closed waveguide , and allowing for the closed waveguide the modulations at the two ends to remain independent of each other . the mathematical observation underlying our formalism",
    "is that is a linear relation between the value of the field and the spatial derivative of the field , known as a robin boundary condition , and when this condition is independent of time , it has a well - known role in making the spatial part of the wave operator in self - adjoint and hence ensuring the unitarity of the time evolution  @xcite . a  time - dependent boundary condition",
    "can then be treated perturbatively by combining the spectral methods of @xcite to the techniques developed in @xcite for mechanically moving cavities . for the semiopen waveguide",
    "our results agree with those found in @xcite via a different formalism .",
    "second , we wish to address the sense in which models a mechanically moving boundary of the dce . for a dirichlet mirror at the time - dependent location @xmath15 ,",
    "the boundary condition on the field reads @xmath16 if we choose in @xmath17 , reduces to for field frequencies much smaller than @xmath18 , but for higher field frequencies the correspondence no longer holds .",
    "we shall see that our perturbative solution of the field evolution with the condition indeed differs from the similar perturbative solution with the condition for frequencies that are not much smaller than @xmath18 , both for a semiopen waveguide and a closed waveguide ; in particular , the large frequency falloff properties of the solution are qualitatively different . simulations of relativistic motion with the mechanically static semiconductor waveguide would hence need to take place in the low frequency regime where the successive approximations from via to hold . both the experiment of @xcite and the proposals of @xcite appear to operate within in this domain by a margin of approximately one order of magnitude .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows :    section [ sec : half - open ] considers evolution under a small discontinuous change in the boundary condition for a semiopen waveguide , and section [ sec : closed ] presents the similar analysis for the closed waveguide .",
    "evolution under small changes in the boundary condition with arbitrary time - dependence for both types of waveguides is written out in section  [ sec : cont - evolution ] .",
    "section [ sec : comparison ] compares the evolution to that under dirichlet boundary conditions at one or two mechanically moving boundaries .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] presents a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "appendix [ app : bogoidentities ] collects technical identities in a perturbative expansion of bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "appendix [ app : accboundary ] treats the evolution under the dirichlet boundary condition at one mechanically moving boundary in a small acceleration expansion in which velocities and travel distances are unrestricted , adapting to one moving boundary the treatment of mechanically rigid cavities given in  @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ app : entanglement ] we derive the first order formula for the negativity measure of entanglement in the case when the modes have a continuous spectrum .",
    "in this section we discuss a semiopen waveguide under a sudden change in the robin boundary condition  .",
    "subsection [ subsec : half - open - static ] establishes the notation and reviews the known properties of a time - independent robin boundary condition .",
    "the sudden change is implemented in subsection  [ subsec : half - open - junction ] , and small sudden changes about the robin boundary condition relevant for the experiment of @xcite and about the dirichlet boundary condition are discussed respectively in subsections [ subsec : half - open - far - from - dir ] and  [ subsec : half - open - near - dir ] .",
    "we adopt units in which the phase velocity @xmath6 in is set to unity .",

    "any choice for @xmath34 makes @xmath37 self - adjoint @xcite and would hence yield a consistent quantum theory of a non - relativistic particle on the half - line , although the choice @xmath30 may in that context be considered less fine - tuned than the others  @xcite . in the present context of a relativistic quantum field theory",

    "it is therefore necessary to use degenerate perturbation theory to determine the eigenvalues to the linear order .",
    "the linear order corrections to the eigenvalues are found to be : @xmath314 where @xmath315",
    "the symplectic eigenvalues are therefore : @xmath316 and the negativity is : @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the smallest of the two symplectic values .",

    "<S> we study analytically the time - dependent boundary conditions of superconducting microwave circuit experiments in the high plasma frequency limit , in which the conditions are robin - type and relate the value of the field to the spatial derivative of the field . </S>",
    "<S> we give an explicit solution to the field evolution for boundary condition modulations that are small in magnitude but may have arbitrary time dependence , in a formalism that applies both to a semiopen waveguide and to a closed waveguide with two independently adjustable boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence between the microwave robin boundary conditions and the mechanically - moving dirichlet boundary conditions of the dynamical casimir effect is shown to break down at high field frequencies , approximately one order of magnitude above the frequencies probed in the 2011 experiment of wilson et  al . </S>",
    "<S> our results bound the parameter regime in which a microwave circuit can be used to model relativistic effects in a mechanically - moving cavity , and they show that beyond this parameter regime moving mirrors produce more particles and generate more entanglement than their non - moving microwave waveguide simulations . </S>"
