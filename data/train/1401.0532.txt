    "using wfc3 s g102 and g141 infrared grisms glass will obtain slitless spectroscopy of the cores of 10 galaxy clusters , with uninterrupted wavelength coverage in the wavelength range 0.81.7 @xmath1 m .",
    "pre - imaging through filters f105w and f140w is obtained before each spectral exposure to assist in the extraction of the spectra and modeling the contamination from neighboring sources .",
    "the total exposure time per cluster is 10 orbits in f105w+g102 and 4 in f140w+g141 .",
    "each cluster is observed at two orientations , differing by approximately 90 degrees , in order to facilitate deblending and extraction of the spectra .",
    "parallel observations with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) through filter f814w and grism g800l are carried out for each cluster in order to map the cluster infall regions .",
    "the three key goals of glass are i ) the study of galaxies at the epoch of reionization through the detection of ly@xmath11  at @xmath0 ; ii ) the study of the cycling of gas and metals in and out of galaxies at @xmath17 ; and iii ) the study of star formation and metallicity as a function of environment in the foreground clusters and infall regions .",
    "magnification by the foreground clusters greatly assists the first two science goals as well as a number of other ancillary science goals ( e.g. lensed supernovae , red quiescent galaxies , etc . ) .",
    "the glass data presented provide the first orientation ( i.e. , half of the final data ) of the cluster macsj0717.5 + 3745 and were carried out on december 24 and 30 2013 . the total exposure times are 10029 and 3812 seconds with the wfc3 g102 and g141 grisms , after removal of a few reads affected by significantly elevated backgrounds ( brammer et al .",

    "summarize the main reduction steps but refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "the data were taken in a 4-point dither pattern identical to the one shown in figure  3 of @xcite . at each individual dither position a f105w - g102 or f141w - g141 pair of exposures was taken , in order to optimize rejection of bad pixels and cosmic rays and improve sampling of the wfc3 point spread function .",
    "the individual exposures were turned into a mosaic using multidrizzle @xcite adjusting the alignments using the pyraf routine , ` tweakshifts ` .",
    "the background was subtracted from the direct images fitting a 2nd order polynomial to each of the source - subtracted exposures .",
    "for the g102 background subtraction we used the master background presented by @xcite , whereas for the g141 grism we used the master backgrounds developed by @xcite for 3d - hst .",
    "the individual background - subtracted exposures were then combined to produce a mosaic with a final pixel scale of roughly @xmath18 per pixel as described by @xcite ( @xmath3half a native pixel ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath312(22) per pixel for the g102(g141 ) dispersion . in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : image ]",
    "we show the resulting interlaced full fov g102 ( left ) and g141 ( right ) grism images .    from these interlaced images",
    "the position of each individual spectrum can be predicted by dispersing each pixel of each individual object in the ` sextractor ` @xcite segmentation maps created from the direct f105w and f140w images . in this way , individual spectra can be extracted and spectral contamination , i.e. , flux from overlapping spectra from neighboring objects , can be accounted for .",

    "contaminating spectra from nearby objects have been modeled and subtracted from these spectra .",
    "mosfire spectra are shown together with glass _ hst _  spectra when available .",
    "we also detect with mosfire the [ ] 4959,5007 doublet in emission from image 6.1 , which falls outside of the glass fov , placing it at @xmath21 .",

    "note the spatial extent of the emission lines , e.g. for 4.1 .",
    "in such cases the combination of _ hst _ s angular resolution and lensing magnification will allow us to measure spatially resolved metallicity and star formation gradients with sub - kpc resolution ( jones et al .",
    "2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "the confirmation of the lensing hypothesis and the spectroscopic redshifts being close to the photometric redshift estimates ( @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 , respectively for sets 4 ,  6 ,  and 12 ) further validates the lens models published and available as part of the frontier fields initiative .",
    "when the glass dataset of macsj0717.5 + 3745  is complete we will carry out a systematic search for new sets of multiple image systems based on spectroscopic data .",
    "the use of spectroscopic data greatly reduces the space of possible counterimages and therefore should enable the unambiguous identification of faint multiple images . in combination with upcoming deep imaging from the frontier fields initiative , the additional data will allow us to further refine the lens models , the magnification maps , and study the distribution of luminous and dark matter in the cluster itself .",

    "it is clear that a significant improvement in the effective limiting fluxes is achieved from the cluster lensing magnification .",

    "naturally , owing to the low and smooth background from space , the sensitivity of glass is more or less independent of wavelength except at the edges of the spectral coverage where the grisms throughput drop .    assuming the spectral energy distribution of the sources to be approximately flat in @xmath48 over the g102 and g141 wavelength range we can estimate the continuum flux for each source as a function of wavelength from a weighted average of the clash f125w , f140w and f160w magnitudes . in combination with the limiting flux the continuum flux gives the limiting equivalent width for each of the 9  objects with suitable spectra .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width limits at the fiducial redshift for each candidate are given in table  [ tab : dropouts ] .    given the intrinsic faintness of the candidates , the equivalent width limits are rather high and it is thus not surprising that we do not detect any ly@xmath11  emission for this sample .",
    "even at @xmath40 only @xmath49 of lyman break galaxies would be expected to have emission larger than 100  and thus be significantly detected in our exposures . however , the equivalent width limits are sufficient to rule out pure line emitters at lower redshift as contaminants @xcite .",

    "these 5 redshifts are close to the photometric redshift estimates used to construct the lens models provided by the frontier fields initiative .",
