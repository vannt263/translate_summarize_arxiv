    "recently , it has been recognized that entanglement does not depict all possible quantum correlations contained in a bipartite state .",
    "based on the measurement on the subsystem in the bipartite system , quantum discord was proposed as a measure for the quantum correlation beyond entanglement  @xcite .",
    "quantum discord was viewed as a figure of merit for characterizing the nonclassical resources in the deterministic quantum computation with one - qubit  @xcite .",
    "it was also discussed that zero - discord of the initial system - environment states is a necessary and sufficient condition for completely positivity of reduced dynamical maps  @xcite . at the same time , a necessary and sufficient condition for nonzero - discord was also given for any dimensional bipartite states  @xcite .",
    "most recently , operational interpretations of quantum discord were proposed in  @xcite , where quantum discord was shown to be a quantitative measure about the performance in the quantum state merging  @xcite . over the past decade ,",
    "quantum discord has received a lot of attentions in refs .",
    "@xcite , and also see the reviews @xcite .    in general ,",
    "quantum discord is upper bounded by the entropy of the measured subsystem  @xcite , but it has remained an open question when this bound is saturated for general mixed states . for this question , some sufficient conditions were given in  @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to systematically investigate the upper bound of quantum discord and give a necessary and sufficient condition for saturating the upper bound of quantum discord . on the other hand , as an achievable upper bound of the quantum discord , the von neumann entropy of a system can be considered as the quantum correlative capacity which tells us how strongly can this system be quantum correlated with others  @xcite .",
    "so we want to ask another question : what can the closeness between the quantum discord and the upper bound tell us ?",
    "it is interesting that there are monogamic relations between different measures on correlations  @xcite . in this paper , by purifying the bipartite systems and using the koashi - winter relation  @xcite , we obtain a new monogamic relation : a system being quantum correlated with another one limits its possible classical correlation with a third system . for the bipartite systems , the total amount of quantum discord between two subsystems and the classical correlation between the measured subsystem and the environment can not exceed the von neumann entropy of the measured subsystem .",
    "we further prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for saturating the upper bound of quantum discord is equivalent to the equality condition for the araki - lieb inequality  @xcite .",
    "and we give the explicit characterization of the quantum states saturating the upper bound of quantum discord , through which we demonstrate that saturating the upper bound of quantum discord means that the measured subsystem can not be further correlated with the environment .",
    "for a two - qubit system , quantum discord is strictly less than the von neumann entropy of the measured qubit of two - qubit states other than when the two - qubit system in pure states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review qd ] , we give a brief review on quantum discord . in sec .",
    "[ sec : up_qd ] , we show that there is a trade - off between the quantum discord and the classical correlation , and then we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the saturating of the upper bound of quantum discord . section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "first , we recall the concepts and properties of the quantum discord .",
    "let hilbert space @xmath0 be a bipartite quantum system .",
    "let @xmath1 be a set of bounded , positive - semidefinite operators with unit trace on @xmath2 . given a bipartite quantum state @xmath3 , the von neumann mutual information between the two subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "is defined as  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the von neumann entropy , @xmath8 is a quantum state of system @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the mutual information @xmath10 is a measure of the total amount of correlations in the bipartite quantum state . generally speaking",
    ", it was divided into quantum correlation and classical correlation  @xcite .",
    "the classical correlation was seen as the amount of information about the subsystem @xmath4 that can be obtained via performing a measurement on the other subsystem @xmath5 .",
    "then , the measure of the classical correlation  @xcite is defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) on @xmath5 , @xmath13 is the von neumann entropy of the post - measurement states @xmath14tr@xmath15 corresponds to outcome @xmath16 with the probability @xmath17tr@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , quantum discord  @xcite is defined by the difference of the quantum mutual information and the classical correlation @xmath19    quantum discord is asymmetric with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in general , @xmath20 , and it is always nonnegative  @xcite .",
    "quantum discord vanishes if and only if there exists an optimal choice of measurement @xmath12 on @xmath5 leaves the state @xmath21 unperturbed  @xcite .",
    "the condition for zero - discord can been reduced to the equality condition using relative entropy  @xcite , and was also discussed in refs  @xcite . for any bipartite pure state @xmath22 ,",
    "one checks that @xmath23",
    "for any general bipartite mixed state @xmath21 , we can always find a tripartite pure state @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents the environment .",
    "hereafter , we will consider this purification about general bipartite mixed state @xmath21 .",
    "the monogamic relation between the entanglement of formation and the classical correlation between the two subsystems is given by  @xcite    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is entanglement of formation ( eof ) , defined as @xmath29 , where the minimum is taken over all pure ensembles @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this relation is universal for any tripartite pure states .",
    "thus , we can give an other reorder version of koashi - winter relation , @xmath32    due to the symmetric property of the eof , i.e. , @xmath33 , we can eliminate the eof by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kw2 ] ) and ( [ eq : kw6 ] ) , then we obtain @xmath34 to be clearer , we substitute @xmath35 into the above equation , and obtain a trade - off between the quantum discord and the classical correlation as follows @xmath36 this new monogamic relation tell us that the amount of quantum correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , plus the amount of classical correlation between @xmath5 and the complementary part @xmath26 , must be equal to the entropy of the measured subsystem @xmath5 .",
    "more importantly , based on this new monogamic equation , we can introduce @xmath37 which quantifies classically correlative capacity of @xmath5 with other systems except @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , for general tripartite mixed states @xmath38 , the classical correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath39 can not be greater than @xmath40 . to be convinced ,",
    "let us purify @xmath38 as @xmath41 , then we have @xmath42 due to the monogamic relation ( [ eq : kwx_1 ] ) .",
    "because the classical correlation is non - increasing under the local quantum operation  @xcite , then we have @xmath43 which is equivalent to @xmath44 we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tradeoff_mixed_states ] ) is applicable for any tripartite state @xmath38 and the equality holds if @xmath38 is pure .",
    "we can see that the total amount of the quantum discord between two subsystems and the classical correlation between the measured subsystem and the environment can not exceed the von neumann entropy of the measured subsystem .",
    "the monogamic relation ( [ eq : kwx_1 ] ) directly supplies a general upper bound for the quantum discord , which was proved in refs .  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we are going to determine which states saturate this bound . combining the monogamic relation ( [ eq : kwx_1 ] ) with the equality condition for araki - lieb inequality",
    ", we have the following result .    [ theorem:1 ] for the bipartite state @xmath21",
    ", we have @xmath45 with equality if and only if there exist a decomposition of @xmath46 as @xmath47 such that @xmath48    to prove this theorem , we first introduce a lemma as follows .",
    "[ lemma:1]considering different correlations and entropy in the bipartite states , the following conditions are equivalent    1 .",
    "@xmath49;[enu : equivalence1 ] 2 .",
    "@xmath50;[enu : equivalence2 ] 3 .",
    "@xmath51.[enu : equivalence3 ]    if one of them is satisfied , then the others are satisfied .",
    "the equivalence of these conditions can be proved by the trade - off relation ( [ eq : kwx_1 ] ) for the purification @xmath52 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kwx_1 ] ) , we can see that @xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath53 .",
    "it is known that the classical correlation vanishes if and only is the states are product states , see refs .",
    "so we have @xmath54 for the tripartite pure states , we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 . thus eq.([eq : equivalence2_0 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath50 and we obtain the equivalence between the first and second conditions .",
    "meantime , the third condition is equivalent to @xmath57 due to the koashi - winter relation @xmath58 . again using the property of the classical correlation",
    ", we can see the third condition is equivalent to @xmath59 , and in turn equivalent to the first condition .",
    "form the above lemma , we will complete the proof of theorem  [ theorem:1 ] .    the inequality was recently given in  @xcite , and it is also a direct consequence of eq.([eq : kwx_1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we obtain that quantum discord @xmath60 saturates the upper bound @xmath61 if and",
    "only if @xmath50 , which is the equality condition of the araki - lieb inequality @xcite @xmath62 when @xmath63 .    recently , the quantum states saturated the araki - lieb inequality was explicitly given by zhang and wu @xcite , by using the explicit characterization of quantum states that saturates the strong subadditivity inequality @xcite and the relation between the araki - lieb inequality and the strong subadditivity inequality @xcite . from the result in ref  @xcite , we know that @xmath50 if and only if there exist a decomposition @xmath64 such that @xmath65 this completes this proof of theorem  [ theorem:1 ] .     and  [ theorem:2 ] . in both subfigures ,",
    "the right side of the solid line are the measured subsystems b. in ( a ) , the quantum discord saturates the general upper bound given by the von neumann entropy of the measured subsystem @xmath5 if and only if there exists a decomposition of @xmath46 as @xmath47 such that @xmath66 ; in ( b ) , the quantum discord equals the von neumann entropy of the unmeasured subsystem @xmath4 if there exist a decomposition of @xmath67 as @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "[ fig : trap ] ]    this result shows that quantum discord is equal to the measured system entropy if and only if the equality in the araki - lieb inequality holds .",
    "it is an interesting thing that the measured subsystem @xmath5 can not correlate with the environment @xmath26 if the quantum discord between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is equal to the entropy of the measured subsystem . in other words",
    ", there must exists an isolated pure subsystem enclosing the measured subsystem in the hilbert space @xmath70 when @xmath49 .",
    "one can also see that given the entropy of the measured subsystem , the maximal quantum discord between @xmath4 and @xmath5 will forbid system @xmath5 from being correlated to other systems outside this composite system .    due to the asymmetric property of quantum discord , one may ask whether or not theorem  [ theorem:1 ] still holds if we consider @xmath71 instead of @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , a conjecture about the von neumann entropy and quantum discord was presented by luo , fu and li in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , @xmath72 later , li and luo showed that the part @xmath73 fails in general , but might be true for low - dimension systems  @xcite .",
    "we only have the following sufficient condition for the situation of @xmath74 .",
    "[ theorem:2 ] for the bipartite state @xmath21 , we have @xmath75 if the equality @xmath76 is satisfied .    according to the equality condition for the araki - lieb inequality ,",
    "@xmath76 is equivalent to that there exists a decomposition @xmath67 as @xmath68 such that @xmath77 for this density matrix , we can get @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the quantum discord for the pure state @xmath80 .",
    "besides , applying the theorem [ theorem:1 ] and lemma [ lemma:1 ] , we can see that all the following quantities are equal : @xmath81 for the quantum state ( [ eq : decomposition_b ] ) .    as an illustration ,",
    "let us consider the following example @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the reduced states can be obtained @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are identity operators on @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "after some calculations one obtains @xmath91 therefore , this state satisfies @xmath76 . on the other hand , one checks that @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "then , @xmath21 is in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomposition_b ] ) with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is identity operator on @xmath97 . with the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : all_equals ] ) , we have @xmath98 for this quantum state .    through theorem  [ theorem:1 ] and theorem  [ theorem:2 ] , we identify two conditions to witness the trapping of correlation within a pure - state subsystem , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trap ] .",
    "this opens a new way to investigate whether the correlation between a and b is essentially the correlation between smaller parts of them .",
    "now , we will discuss the application of our results in two - qubit system .",
    "a two - dimension hilbert space can not be decomposed any more .",
    "the only possibility of @xmath99 for two - qubit states is that @xmath21 is a pure state .",
    "hence , its upper bound is not reachable except two - qubit pure state  @xcite , namely , we have @xmath100 for any mixed two - qubit state .",
    "in this work , we have given a new monogamic relation between the quantum discord and the classical correlation in terms of the koashi - winter relations .",
    "based on the equality conditions for the araki - lieb inequality , we have given a necessary and sufficient condition for the saturating of the upper bound of quantum discord .",
    "we have shown that the subsystem of the bipartite system can not correlated with the other system if the quantum discord of the bipartite system is equal to the entropy of the measured subsystem .",
    "we showed that there are some mixed states where quantum discord is equal to entanglement of formation .",
    "in particular , for two - qubit state , its upper bound is not reachable except pure state .",
