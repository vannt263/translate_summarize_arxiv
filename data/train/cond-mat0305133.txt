    "the rock - scissors - paper like cyclic dominance among three states ( modes , species , strategies , opinions ) are widely studied in different spatial systems . for example",
    ", the rayleigh - bernard convection in fluid layers rotating around a vertical axis exhibits the kpper - lortz instability @xcite resulting in a cyclic change of the three possible directions of parallel convection rolls @xcite .",
    "such a situation can appear in biological ( ecological ) systems too @xcite .",
    "very recently , kerr _",
    "_ @xcite have justified experimentally that the cyclic dominance between the toxic , sensitive and resistant microbes maintains their coexistence as predicted previously by several theoretical works @xcite .",
    "the emergence of cyclic invasions has also been observed for some three - strategy evolutionary games where this phenomenon promotes the cooperation among selfish individuals @xcite .    the above three - state systems exhibit some general features .",
    "namely , spiral formation ( or rotating three - edge vortices and antivortices ) can occur on the two - dimensional backgrounds @xcite as it is observed for the belousov - zhabotinskii reaction as well as for the numerical investigation of excitable activator - inhibitor media @xcite .",
    "this self - organizing structure can provide a stability against some external invaders and thereby it plays crucial role in ecological systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore the cyclic dominance yields a paradoxical response to the external support of one of the species @xcite and global oscillation can occur when varying either the model @xcite or the structural parameters @xcite if long range interactions are allowed .    in this work",
    "the spatial rock - scissors - paper game will be extended for such regular networks where each site has four neighbours .",
    "we discuss how the quenched and annealed randomness of the network affects the spatiotemporal distribution of species .",
    "such a comparison has already been performed for a rumor propagation model @xcite .",
    "now , the randomness is introduced in small - world manner @xcite leaving the degree of sites unchanged .",
    "this restriction does not influence the small - world feature of the network and it simplifies the application of some theoretical approximation at least for the case of annealed randomness .",
    "however , the main conclusion remains valid for both types of randomness .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations indicate that these systems undergo a transition ( hopf bifurcation ) from a stationary state ( with fixed average concentrations ) to a global oscillation .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation increases with the measure of randomness and the increasing oscillation terminates at one of the absorbing ( homogeneous ) states above a second threshold value for annealed randomness .",
    "we show that neither the mean - field nor the pair approximations can explain these transitions .",
    "the failure of these descriptions has inspired us to use the more sophisticated dynamical cluster techniques where one determines all the configuration probabilities on a @xmath1-site cluster . at the levels of @xmath2 and 2",
    "this technique is equivalent to the mentioned mean - field and pair approximations .",
    "the essence of this simple method is described in refs .",
    "we consider a very simple model where the sites of a regular graph are occupied by one of the three species ( @xmath3 ) that dominate cyclically each other .",
    "the evolutionary process is governed by the sequence of elementary invasions along the randomly chosen edges of the graph .",
    "namely , first we choose a site and one of its linked ( neighbouring ) sites at random .",
    "if these two sites are occupied by different species then the predator occupies the prey s site , i.e. , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairs transform into @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 into @xmath9 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 into @xmath12 . starting from a random initial state the above process is repeated until the system reaches the stationary state or limit cycle we study .",
    "this system was already analysed systematically by several authors if the sites form a @xmath13-dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "two types of random structures will be contrasted with each other . in the first case",
    "the structure is quenched after the generation of edges .",
    "figure [ fig : rswstruc ] illustrates an example whose creation is similar to those suggested by watts and strogatz @xcite .",
    "notice , that the present algorithm ( explained in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : rswstruc ] ) conserves the degree of sites , i.e. , the number of neighbours remains fixed ( @xmath14 ) for each site . in the second case the `` neighbourhood ''",
    "is not fixed in time , that is a randomly chosen new site can be replaced for any standard neighbours during the elementary invasions explained above .",
    "these types of random networks can characterize the interaction among individuals in social systems @xcite . in both cases",
    "the random links connect two sites being arbitrary distance from each other in the original structure .",
    "the measure of quenched randomness is characterized by the @xmath15 portion of random links substituted for the nearest neighbour bonds .",
    "if @xmath16 this structure reproduces the square lattice and for @xmath17 it is equivalent to a random regular graph @xcite where the typical local structure is analogous to a cayley tree for large number of sites @xmath18 .",
    "previous investigations indicated that some phenomena on the random regular graphs can be well described analytically if the background is assumed to be a bethe lattice in the limit @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in other words , the structure with @xmath17 can be considered as a possible realization of the bethe lattice in the simulations for large @xmath18 .    unfortunately , the present random regular structures with @xmath20 are not yet investigated rigorously , although many other classes of networks are well studied @xcite .",
    "we think that the constraint of regularity leaves the relevant features unchanged and the present structure remains similar to those introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite on a square lattice .",
    "when increasing @xmath15 the present structure exhibits a continuous transition from the square lattice to the random regular graph .    besides the above quenched randomness we will investigate the consequences of the annealed ( temporal ) randomness in the structure . in this case",
    "the standard links are defined by the bonds between the nearest neighbours sites forming a square lattice .",
    "occasionally the standard link is replaced by a random one with a probability @xmath0 characterizing the strength of annealed randomness .",
    "evidently , for @xmath21 the structure is equivalent to the square lattice . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath22",
    "this system satisfies the conditions of mean - field approaches .",
    "the mc simulations are performed on a network consisting of @xmath23 sites where the linear size of the square lattice ( @xmath24 ) is varied from 400 to 3200 .",
    "the regular small - world networks are constructed from a square lattice repeating the rewiring steps @xmath25 times as explained in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : rswstruc ] .",
    "( the logarithmic correction takes into account that the substitution of a random link for another random one does not increase the quenched randomness . )",
    "the above model has two parameters characteristic to the quenched ( @xmath15 ) and annealed ( @xmath0 ) randomness of the background .",
    "the present analysis is restricted to those cases when one of them is chosen to be zero .    for small sizes ( @xmath26 )",
    "this system evolves into one of the three absorbing states where all the sites are occupied by the same species . for sufficiently large system sizes ,",
    "however , the three species can coexist and after some transient time the state can be well described by the current concentration of the three species [ @xmath27 . in order to observe these states we have to choose such a large @xmath24 where the amplitude of fluctuations becomes significantly less than the minimum value of concentrations .",
    "the above choices satisfy this condition .    on the square lattice ( @xmath28 ) this system develops into a stationary state where all three species are present with the same average concentration , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath29 corresponding to the central point in the ternary phase diagram as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] . in this case",
    "the three species alternate cyclically at each site and the short range interactions are not able to synchronize these local oscillations .",
    "the corresponding self - organizing spatiotemporal patterns are well investigated previously by several authors @xcite . in these patterns",
    "the rotating vortices ( spirals ) and antivortices are not recognizable because of the interfacial roughening .",
    "the absence of smooth interfaces ( surface tension ) is caused by the fact that the elementary invasions between two neighbouring sites are not affected by their neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "global oscillation ( synchronization ) occurs when the frequency of random ( long range ) links exceeds a threshold value dependent on whether quenched or annealed randomness is considered . to illustrate the time - dependence of the species distributions during a period of this global oscillation six consecutive snapshots",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : osc6ff ] .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation increases with the measure of randomness in both cases .",
    "if the annealed randomness exceeds a second threshold value then the trajectories approach the edges of the triangle and sooner or later the evolution is terminated at one of the homogeneous ( absorbing ) states ( where the system stays for ever ) .",
    "it is emphasized , however , that the homogeneous states are not stable against the invasion of their predators .",
    "for example , the offsprings of a single species 3 will occupy the whole territory of species 1 in the absence of species 2 .    in the ternary phase diagram the shape of the limit cycles reflects the cyclic symmetry between the species and its extension",
    "is described by the area @xmath30 compared to its maximum value .",
    "the average value of this quantity can be easily determined by numerical integration after a suitable relaxation time for either the mc simulations or the dynamical cluster techniques .",
    "evidently , @xmath30 vanishes if the system tends toward the central fixed point , and it goes to 1 when the trajectories approach the edges of triangle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] ) .",
    "systematic mc simulations are carried out to determine the average value of @xmath30 on the regular small - world structure for different @xmath15 values .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : aq ] refer to a transition from a fixed point to the limit cycle . for weak randomness [ @xmath31 the system always tends to the central fixed point .",
    "conversely , oscillating behaviour occurs and the area @xmath30 ( as well as the amplitude ) of the limit cycle increases monotonously with @xmath15 and tends to the value @xmath32 .",
    "the limit @xmath33 is investigated on a random regular graph created by using a different algorithm @xcite . in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath30",
    "vanishes linearly with @xmath34 in agreement with the prediction of hopf bifurcation describing the emergence of a limit cycle in a mean - field type system if the model parameters are varied .",
    "further rigorous investigations are required to quantify the variations in the spatiotemporal patterns when approaching the transition point .",
    "as it is already mentioned the system size should be large enough to avoid the finite size effects .",
    "the sharpe transition to the global oscillation is wiped out by fluctuations on smaller systems as discussed previously by kuperman and abramson @xcite who considered a three - state ( cyclic ) epidemiological model on small world networks suggested by watts and strogatz @xcite .",
    "the finite size effects are more dangerous when the value of area @xmath30 approaches 1 . in this case the evolution may be easily traped by one of the absorbing states .",
    "this difficulty is avoided by choosing sufficiently large system size . as a result",
    ", the plotted @xmath35 function may be considered as the infinite size limit .",
    "the above analysis was repeated for the annealed randomness when varying @xmath0 for @xmath16 .",
    "the results of mc simulations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ap ] . the oscillating behaviour can be observed for @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . if @xmath39 then the increasing spiral trajectory terminates in one of the absorbing states as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] . in the vicinity of the first threshold value @xmath40 in agreement with the expectation . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath30 approaches 1 very smoothly when @xmath0 goes to @xmath41 .",
    "surprisingly , our mc data can be well approximated by a power law behaviour [ @xmath42 as indicated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ap ] . the numerical fit yields",
    "@xmath43 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the emergence of global oscillation has already been observed in the above mentioned epidemiological model when varying the quenched randomness without the consraints of regularity @xcite .",
    "the similar behavior refers to the robustness of this type of transition .",
    "the predictions of the traditional mean - field analysis are well discussed in the textbook by hofbauer and sigmund @xcite . according to this approach four",
    "stationary states exist , namely , the above mentioned three absorbing states ( e.g. @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) and the well - mixed symmetric state where the three species are present with the same concentration ( 1/3 ) .",
    "besides these stationary solutions the mean - field analysis shows the existence of set of oscillating states whose closed trajectories draw concentric orbits around the centrum in the ternary phase diagram . along these orbits",
    "the product @xmath46 is conserved . in agreement with the expectation",
    "the mc simulations reproduce this behaviour for @xmath47 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] .",
    "the application of the pair approximation is inspired by its success when investigating an evolutionary game with three ( cyclically dominated ) strategies on a random regular graph @xcite .",
    "this model exhibits both transitions mentioned above when varying the parameter(s ) of payoff matrix .",
    "it is underlined that here the adoption of the neighbouring strategies depends on the neighbourhood .    in the pair approximations",
    "one determines the @xmath48 probability of finding @xmath49 configuration on two nearest neighbour ( or linked ) sites . in this case equations of motion",
    "are derived for these quantities taking into account the contribution of all the elementary invasion processes ( details are given in the textbook by marro and dickman @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical integration of the corresponding equations predicts growing spirals approaching the boundaries ( and resulting in the maximum value @xmath50 in the limit @xmath51 ) as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] .",
    "this prediction is contrary to the results of mc simulations obtained on either the square lattice ( @xmath52 ) or the random regular graphs ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we have to emphasize that although the equations of motion involve explicitly the number of neighbours the simple pair approximation can not distinguish the structure of the bethe and square lattices . in the light of previous experiences",
    "@xcite it is expected that the pair approximation can well describe the behaviour observed by mc simulations on the random regular graph because in this structure the average loop size increases with with @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "thus , for large @xmath18 , the local structure is tree - like and the short range correlations between two sites can be well approximated by a product of the @xmath55 configuration probabilities involved along the single path connecting the two sites .",
    "the comparison of the above values of @xmath30 does not confirm this expectation .",
    "more precisely , the pair approximation can not account for the effect preventing the unlimited growth of the area of limit cycle .",
    "preliminary results suggest that the limit value of @xmath30 depends on the degree of the random regular graph . in the near future",
    "we wish to study this effect by a suitable extension of the dynamical cluster techniques .",
    "henceforth , however , our efforts will be concentrated on the annealed randomness because its investigation can be easily builted into the dynamical cluster technique . at the level of pair approximation",
    "the corresponding results predict that the `` spiral pitch '' decreases when @xmath0 is increased and vanishes in the mean - field limit ( @xmath47 ) as expected .    on the square lattice ,",
    "as mentioned above , the pair approximation is not capable to describe the appearance of self - organizing patterns maintained by the interfacial motions due to cyclic invasions .",
    "this striking shortage can be eliminated by choosing larger and larger clusters on which we determine all the possible configuration probabilities @xcite .",
    "for example , at the level of four - site approximation we determine the configuration probabilities @xmath56 on a @xmath57 cluster assumed to be translation invariant on the square lattice .",
    "a recent summary of larger - cluster approximations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this approach takes explicitly into account some topological features of the square lattice .",
    "a nearest - neighbor invasion ( e.g. @xmath58 as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : invcf ] ) will simultaneously affect all the four four - site configuration probabilities involved .",
    "the spatial effect is taken into account more rigorously if the probability of such a nine - site constellation is approximated as @xmath59 where the configuration probabilities satisfy the following compatibility conditions : @xmath60    the time derivative of @xmath56 can be described by a master equation that summarizes the contribution of all the possible elementary invasions .",
