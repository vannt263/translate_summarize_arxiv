    "in this work we study radiative corrections to the process of @xmath0 conversion , i.e. we consider the process of @xmath1 conversion including the elastic process of @xmath0 conversion and the process of @xmath3 conversion with a photon emission below a certain energy @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0 conversion is the process of a transformation of a muon into an electron in the presence of a nucleus .",
    "the clear signature of @xmath0 conversion is an appearance in the final state of a monochromatic electron of the energy    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is a nuclear mass , @xmath7 is a muon mass , @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , z is a nuclear charge . in particular , @xmath9 is 104.963 mev for aluminum .    in an experimental setup a monochromatic spectrum of @xmath0 conversion electrons at 105 mev",
    "is transformed to a distribution with a low energy tail .",
    "this transformation in the electron spectrum can be either due to fluctuations of energy loss of electrons in a target or because of a photon emission in the process of @xmath1 conversion .",
    "the selection criterion of @xmath1 conversion events is an electron momentum above the threshold momentum of 103.5 mev / c , which corresponds to the maximum energy loss of 1.5 mev .",
    "it is important to note that in real experiments a pure elastic process is not physically observable since due to the presence of charged particles in the initial , intermediate or final states the process can be accompanied by an emission of a photon .",
    "therefore the measured probability of the process of @xmath1 conversion is a sum of probabilities of the pure elastic process corrected by virtual photon exchange and of a real soft photon emission below a maximum energy @xmath4 , which in our case is 1.5 mev .",
    "in fact if the emitted real soft photon is not detected , one can not distinguish a bremsstrahlung process from the elastic one .",
    "because the energy release in the process of @xmath1 conversion is about @xmath10 one could expect that the virtual photon corrections and the soft photon emission can be enhanced by a large logarithmic factor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an electron mass .",
    "radiative corrections lead to a change in the probability of @xmath0 conversion process calculated without radiative corrections .",
    "the real soft photons emission contributes to a change of electron spectrum from monoenergetic one at 105 mev to a spectrum with a low energy tail .",
    "however this effect of smearing of the initial momentum distribution due to the soft photon emission should be compared with a smearing due to energy loss fluctuations in a target .",
    "the detailed analysis of hard photon emission requires knowledge of specific particle physics models . in order to avoid complications in analysis of high energy photon spectrum and to understand qualitatively a hard photon emission the radiative pion decay is considered . by analyzing this decay which possesses the same kinematic properties and a comparable energy scale as @xmath3 conversion the range of application of the soft photon approximation",
    "can be found .",
    "it is worth to note that the hard photon emission with photons produced at energy above 1.5 mev is not important for simulation of @xmath1 conversion process .",
    "hard photons carry away a significant part of muon energy thus reducing an electron energy but due to the selection criterion 103.5 mev / c on the threshold momentum such electrons are rejected and such events do not contribute to useful events .",
    "let us consider @xmath3 conversion process in which a virtual photon emission is involved .",
    "the feynman diagrams describing virtual photon emission  @xcite are presented in figure  [ fig : diag_virt ] .",
    "it can be shown that an integral describing the radiative correction to the lepton vertex is infrared divergent .",
    "this integral can be artificially well - defined with an introduction of an infinite small mass @xmath13 of a photon . with this modification the leading term in leading logarithm approximation",
    "is given by    @xmath14 \\label{virt}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the @xmath3 conversion rate calculated without radiative corrections .",
    "feynman diagrams describing the process of inner bremsstrahlung are presented in figure  [ fig : diag_soft ] .",
    "let s consider the case of emission of low energy photons .",
    "in this limit we assume that a photon energy is much less than energies of particles taking part in muon - electron conversion and momentum transfered to a nucleus . on the other hand",
    "we assume the validity of the perturbation theory , i.e. the smallness of a parameter @xmath16 which provides a suppression of multi - photon emission .    following a standard technique ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in the limit of photon low energies",
    "the photon emission can be taken into account by adding an external photon line to a diagram of the elastic process . in this case",
    "the most important are diagrams with an emission from external charged particles lines , in all other parts of diagrams one can neglect changes in momenta due to the soft photon emission",
    ". therefore dirac spinors of initial muon and outgoing electron are modified in the following way    @xmath17    @xmath18    where k , @xmath19 , q are the four - vectors of muon , electron and photon , respectively , @xmath20 is the polarization of a photon .",
    "a photon emission from a non - relativistic nucleus is neglected .    by using dirac equations these relations",
    "can be simplified    @xmath21    @xmath22    as a result amplitude m of muon - electron conversion with the soft photon emission can be factorized according to    @xmath23 ~ , \\label{matr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the amplitude of the same process of @xmath0 conversion without photon emission .",
    "this is well - know general result which is process independent .    summing up over the photon polarization and by applying standard technique of calculation of process probability the differential probability to emit a single soft photon with momentum q in the process of @xmath3 conversion is given by    @xmath25 \\frac{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3 2\\omega } ~ . \\label{prob1}\\ ] ]    integration of eq.([prob1 ] ) over an electron momentum within kinematic limits gives the spectrum of soft photons in the process of muon - electron conversion    @xmath26    note that the same expression for the spectrum of soft photon emission can be obtain by applying the classical consideration  @xcite instead of feynman diagram technique .",
    "the limit @xmath27 in eq.([prob2 ] ) represents a logarithmic divergence meaning that the total probability of emitting a single very soft photon by a charge particle is infinite , this is well - known infrared catastrophe . by introducing a small photon mass @xmath13 the integral over @xmath28 becomes well - defined and the probability of the soft photon emission is derived from eq.([prob2 ] ) by integrating over the photon energy from the small photon mass to the maximum energy @xmath4 of emitted soft photons    @xmath29",
    "the inner bremsstrahlung spectrum diverges for low energy photons but this divergence in the total rate is canceled by virtual photon corrections .",
    "therefore physically observable is the sum of probabilities of the elastic process corrected by the virtual photon emission and of the soft photon emission .    by adding the probabilities @xmath30 and @xmath31 the infrared divergences from the soft bremsstrahlung and from the lepton vertex corrections cancel each other producing a finite probability of radiative @xmath1 conversion with the emission of soft photon with the energy below @xmath4 :    @xmath32 . \\label{vs}\\ ] ]    note that this is the probability of radiative @xmath1 conversion calculated in the first order in electromagnetic constant @xmath8 .",
