    "john a. wheeler back in 1955 considered the possibility that spacetime could be undergoing topological fluctuations at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "this changing spacetime is best known as the _ spacetime foam _ , and can be a model for the quantum gravitational vacuum .",
    "indeed , wheeler also considered wormhole - type solutions , denoted as geons , obtained from the coupled equations of electromagnetism and general relativity , as objects of the spacetime quantum foam connecting different regions of spacetime at the planck scale  @xcite . in this proceedings , we consider the possibility of quantum fluctuations in the context of gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "the latter consists of a distortion of the spacetime metric at energies of the planck energy , and for this purpose a general approach , denoted as deformed or doubly special relativity , was developed in order to preserve the relativity of inertial frames , maintain the planck energy invariant and impose that in the limit @xmath1 , the speed of a massless particle tends to a universal and invariant constant , @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , we explore the possibility that wormhole geometries are sustained by their own quantum fluctuations , in the context of gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "we consider a semi - classical approach , where the graviton one - loop contribution to a classical energy in a background spacetime is computed through a variational approach with gaussian trial wave functionals .",
    "the energy density of the graviton one - loop contribution to a classical energy in a wormhole background is considered as a self - consistent source for wormholes @xcite . in this semi - classical context",
    ", we consider specific choices for the rainbow s functions and find a plethora of wormhole solutions , including non - asymptotically flat geometries and solutions where the quantum corrections are exponentially suppressed , which provide asymptotically flat wormhole geometries .",
    "in fact , the possibility that quantum fluctuations induce a topology change , in gravity s rainbow , has also been explored @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the graviton one - loop contribution , or equivalently the background spacetime , was let to evolve , and consequently the classical energy was determined .",
    "note that the background metric was fixed to be minkowskian in the equation governing the quantum fluctuations , which behaves essentially as a backreaction equation , and the quantum fluctuations were let to evolve .",
    "then , the classical energy , which depends on the evolved metric functions , was evaluated .",
    "analysing this procedure , a natural ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff was obtained , which forbids the presence of an interior spacetime region , and may result in a multipy - connected spacetime . thus , in the context of gravity s rainbow , this process may be interpreted as a change in topology , and in principle results in the presence of a planckian wormhole .",
