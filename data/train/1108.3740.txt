    "as first realized by @xcite , some concentrations of asteroids are apparent if we look at their distribution in the space of orbital elements .",
    "these groups , known as the asteroid families , are believed to have originated from catastrophic disruptions of single parent bodies as a consequence of energetic asteroid collisions .",
    "these events are thought to have produced ejections of fragments into nearby heliocentric orbits , with relative velocities much lower than the parent body s orbital speed .",
    "asteroid families were extensively investigated in the last decades , because these are unique _ natural laboratories _ to study the outcomes of high - energy collisions @xcite .",
    "also , the number of currently identified families is an important constraint to model the collisional history of the asteroid main belt @xcite .",
    "asteroid families are usually identified in the space of proper elements : proper semi - major axis ( @xmath1 ) , proper eccentricity ( @xmath2 ) , and proper inclination ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "proper orbital elements , being quasi - integrals of motion and thus nearly constant over time , are suited to be used to identify groupings that are stable and are not affected by transient oscillations of the osculating orbital elements .    to date",
    ", several tens of families have been discovered across the asteroid main belt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these families are located at proper inclinations lower than about @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the situation is more difficult at higher inclinations .",
    "the number of existing asteroids tends to decrease for increasing orbital inclination . as a consequence",
    ", asteroid surveys are usually centered around the ecliptic , and this also tends to introduce an observational bias against the discovery of high - inclination objects . until recently",
    ", the number of known high - inclination asteroids was relatively small .",
    "moreover , the number of high - inclination asteroids for which proper elements had been computed was even smaller .",
    "this was due to the fact that analytical proper elements @xcite , which are computed for both numbered and multi - opposition asteroids , are not accurate enough for highly inclined orbits . in the past ,",
    "computations of proper elements by means of the methods specially developed to handle highly inclined and/or eccentric orbits were carried out by some authors for a limited number of asteroids @xcite .",
    "more recently , the computation of the so - called synthetic proper elements @xcite , has made it possible to compute with a good accuracy proper elements for high - inclination and high - eccentricity orbits as well .",
    "a large data set of asteroid proper elements is essential for the identification of asteroid families .",
    "previous searches for families among high - inclination asteroids were seriously limited by the paucity of discovered asteroids and available proper elements .",
    "this problem affected also the only systematic search published in the recent years , namely that performed by @xcite .",
    "recently , the number of known high - inclination asteroids has increased significantly . as of june 2010 , when we commenced the present analysis , the database of synthetic proper elements , maintained at _ astdys _ web page , included 10,265 objects with @xmath6 greater than @xmath0 . in this database , however , synthetic proper elements were available only for numbered asteroids . in order to increase the available sample , following the approach described in @xcite , we have computed synthetic proper elements for an additional sample of 8295 multi - opposition objects . in this way , for the purposes of our analysis , we have used a data - base of synthetic proper elements including 18,560 objects .",
    "the distributions of these asteroids , in the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) and ( @xmath1,@xmath6 ) planes , are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : aei ] .    as a comparison , in his search for high - inclination families @xcite used a sample about 5 times smaller ( 3697 asteroids ) .",
    "grater than @xmath7 , used by @xcite , we chose to work with objects having @xmath6 greater than @xmath0 .",
    "this was done in order to identify possible traces of the classical main belt families among the highly inclined asteroids . in our sample",
    "there are 17,564 asteroids with @xmath6 grater than @xmath7 . ]",
    "similar studies were also performed for the inner and intermediate regions of the asteroid belt by @xcite , using only 1736 objects in the inner region , and 4452 objects in the intermediate zone .",
    "our sample is about 2 times larger in the inner zone , and more than @xmath8 larger in the intermediate zone ( 3553 and 5439 asteroids respectively ) .",
    "no search for families in the outer belt was performed so far in the investigations by carruba .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a systematic search for families among high - inclination asteroids .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : method ] the methods and techniques used to identify statistically significant groups of asteroids in the space of proper elements are described .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in section  [ s : results ] .",
    "these include a list of different kinds of groupings that we found in the inner , intermediate and outer part of the asteroid belt . in section  [ s : sdss ]",
    "we improve our analysis by taking into account the information about the object colors as obtained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : conclusions ] we outline our main conclusions .",
    "in our analysis we have in general followed the approach described in the papers by @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main principles of this approach , we describe the main steps of its practical implementation , and explain a few modifications that we have introduced , mainly to improve the reliability of family membership .",
    "we identified asteroid families in our proper element data - base by using the so - called hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ) based upon the nearest - neighbor concept ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general terms",
    ", the hcm approach is based on a few simple ideas .",
    "first , a metric is defined , to compute mutual distances between the objects in the space of proper elements . in particular",
    ", we have adopted the same metric that was used in previous papers .",
    "therefore , the distance @xmath9 between two objects is computed according to the relation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the heliocentric velocity of an asteroid on a circular orbit having the semi - major axis @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath12  =  @xmath13 , @xmath14  =  @xmath15 , and @xmath16  =  @xmath17 . the indexes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) denote the two bodies under consideration . note also that @xmath1 in the above formula corresponds to the average of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    with this choice",
    ", @xmath9 has the dimension of a velocity , and is usually expressed in m / s .",
    "once the mutual distances are computed , it is possible to identify the existence of groupings formed by objects that , at a given level of distance @xmath9 , have distances from their closest neighbor smaller than @xmath9 . the so - called _ stalactite diagrams _ , first used by @xcite , are an effective way to display the groupings found at different distance levels , and to show how the membership of each group varies as a function of the distance limit .",
    "examples will be given in the next section .",
    "using this representation , the groupings of objects present in a given sample are graphically displayed as a system of _ stalactites _ , the most compact groupings being represented as the deepest stalactite branches .",
    "the basic problem with the hcm approach is to define criteria for groupings that can not be due to pure chance .",
    "the simple idea is that asteroid families produced by collisional processes should show up as deep and thick stalactite branches which can not be produced by other mechanisms . to put this in more quantitative terms , in the classical papers adopting the hcm approach , a critical value of distance @xmath20 was found , for which it could be reasonably concluded that groupings giving rise at deeper stalactite branches , or stalactites reaching the same distance level , but with unlikely high numbers of members , could not be due to chance , and necessarily have a physical origin .    in its practical implementation ,",
    "the hcm approach includes therefore two basic parameters which have to be defined .",
    "one is the cut - off distance @xmath20 .",
    "the second parameter is the minimum number of objects , @xmath21 , that is requested to characterize a statistically significant group ( with respect to our selection criteria ) at @xmath20 .    as for @xmath20 , in the previous papers this parameter",
    "was derived by creating artificial populations ( `` quasi random populations '' ) of synthetic objects , equal in number to the real population present in a given region of the proper element space , and built in such a way as to mimic independently the large - scale distributions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath6 of the real population .",
    "the distance levels of the deepest stalactite branches formed by a minimum number of @xmath21 synthetic objects were recorded . by repeating this operation several times",
    ", an average value of minimum distance at which random grouping could still occur was derived , together with its uncertainty .",
    "this distance level was called quasi random level ( qrl ) , and was assumed to correspond to @xmath20 for a given region of the proper element space .",
    "qrl built in such a way takes into account non - homogeneity of the distribution of the real objects in the given region .",
    "thus , we can derive an evaluation of the distance level in that region for which we can not expect that denser clusters of objects could exist purely due to chance .",
    "this takes into account the features of the non - homogeneous proper element distribution of the real objects in the given region .",
    "this approach is fairly powerful , but it is not totally exempt from problems .",
    "for instance , the obtained qrl is an average value of distance for a given region , and it `` smears '' out the small - scale , local properties of the distribution of objects .",
    "the main undesired consequence of this concerns the resulting definition of family memberships .",
    "the qrl concept is very satisfactory for the identification of families in a given region of the proper elements space , but it turns out to be a little too rigid as far as family membership is concerned , because the membership of a family tends to be more influenced by the local density of objects .",
    "for this reason , as we will explain below , in this paper we have modified the criteria adopted in previous application of the hcm for defining family memberships .    as for the adopted value of @xmath21 , it was chosen to be @xmath22 at the epoch of the analysis performed by @xcite . in subsequent",
    "analyzes considering increasingly bigger data - sets of asteroid proper elements @xcite , the adopted values of @xmath21 were scaled as the square root of the ratio between the numbers of objects in the newer and in the older sample . in particular , the values of @xmath21 used by @xcite were ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) for the inner , intermediate and outer zone respectively ( for a definition of these zones , see later ) .    in the above - mentioned papers ,",
    "it was clearly stated that the adopted values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 had to be considered not as `` solutions '' of the problem , but as tentative guesses to be interpreted in a statistical sense . in particular , to adopt an identical @xmath20 for all the families present in a given region of the proper element space , could lead to overestimate the membership of some families , and to underestimate the membership of some others .    in the present paper",
    ", we followed generally the same procedure , but we have introduced certain changes to take into account ( 1 ) some specificities of the high - inclination asteroid population ; ( 2 ) some intrinsic limits of the statistical approach described above , mainly for what concerns the definition of the membership of identified families ; ( 3 ) the fact that we know a priori that any asteroid sample can not be complete beyond some value of magnitude , and family classifications tend to evolve as larger data sets of asteroid proper elements , corresponding to increasing number of discovered objects , become progressively available . in particular :    * in deriving the qrl , we did not remove _ a priori _ the members of big families possibly present in each zone , as was done by @xcite .",
    "these authors did so to prevent the possibility that the presence of very populous families might affect the generation of the quasi random synthetic populations ( by `` saturating '' some bins of the proper elements distributions ) .",
    "the reason why we did not implement this procedure in the present analysis is that the high - inclination population , mainly in the inner region , is notably non uniform , and the minimum distance level achieved by any population of fully - random synthetic objects would be in any case unreasonably high , leading to possible removal of very large fractions of the real objects present in some zone .",
    "* we conservatively adopted as qrl not the average deepest level achieved by the stalactites of ten quasi - random populations generated in each zone , but the _ deepest _ level found in the ten cases . *",
    "the membership of each family was derived not by looking simply at the objects present at qrl , but by making a more accurate analysis of each single case , as explained below .",
    "* we paid attention to the possible presence of small , but very compact groupings which might be the cores of families consisting of small asteroids , most of which have not yet been discovered .",
    "as a first step , we divided the main belt into three zones .",
    "they correspond to the inner , middle and outer region of the belt .",
    "the semi - major axis borders between adjacent zones are identical to those adopted by @xcite , and correspond to the 3/1 and the 5/2 mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with jupiter .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 boundaries of the three regions are given in table  [ t : prop ] .",
    "next , for each zone , we defined a corresponding value of @xmath21 . in doing so , we tried to be as consistent as possible with the values previously used by @xcite , taking into account the differences in both the numbers of objects present in our regions , as well as the volumes of the regions themselves . in practical terms , however , we verified that the results of the family search are not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath21 .",
    "the adopted values are listed in table  [ t : prop ] .",
    ".the properties of the three zones of asteroid belt considered in this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be seen , and not unexpectedly , the @xmath26 complex dominates in the inner zone , whereas the @xmath27/@xmath28 complex is dominant in the outer zone . in the middle region",
    "the two complexes have similar abundances .",
    "although a somewhat larger fraction of @xmath26 asteroids could be expected in the intermediate zone , our results are in general agreement with current knowledge about the abundance of different taxonomic classes as a function of heliocentric distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we found a significantly larger abundance of @xmath26 asteroids in the outer zone with respect to recent results by @xcite , who performed a similar study for low - inclination asteroids in the main belt . according to @xcite",
    ", differences in the abundance of different taxonomic complexes across the main belt exist between low- and high - inclination asteroids .",
    "these authors also found that the abundance of @xmath26-class asteroids is significantly affected by the presence of asteroid families .",
    "our results confirm these findings , although it is not clear to us whether observational biases acting against the discovery of high - inclination , low - albedo asteroids in the outer belt could also play an important role . in any case",
    ", we find that a major contribution to the relative abundance of @xmath26 class asteroids in the outer belt at high orbital inclination , is due to the presence of one single , large family , having as its lowest - numbered member the asteroid ( 181 ) eucharis ( see also the discussion below ) .",
    "having the values of principal components , calculated using eqs .   and  , we could compute the average values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all families identified by hcm for which at least 5 members are included in the sdss moc  4 .",
    "the corresponding values are listed in table  [ t : sdss ] .",

    "this can be better appreciated in fig .",

    "more in particular , color data are available for @xmath46 members of the phocaea family .",
    "about 80% of these belong to the @xmath26-complex .",
    "spectral types ( derived from spectroscopy ) are available for @xmath47 asteroids that belong to the phocaea family .",
    "most of them are the @xmath26-class with only three exceptions , which correspond to likely interlopers .",
    "the asteroids ( 326 ) tamara and ( 1963 ) bezovec are @xmath27-class , while asteroid ( 1318 ) nerina is an @xmath28-class .    in the intermediate zone ,",
    "the numbers of families belonging to the @xmath26 and @xmath27/@xmath28 complexes are the same .",

    "this is in a good agreement with the relative abundance of these two complexes in this region of the belt ( see table  [ t : sdss_frac ] ) .",
    "the number of family members with known spectral type is very limited .",
    "however , in most cases these data are consistent with derived sdss colors .",
    "let us discuss here only a few exceptions .",
    "the gersuind family includes two members with known spectral type , namely asteroid ( 686 ) gersuind itself , which is @xmath26 class , and asteroid ( 1609 ) brenda which is classified as @xmath48 type .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath33 suggest that members of this family should be @xmath26-type asteroids .",
    "this is in agreement with the spectral classification of ( 686 ) gersuind .",
    "as for the @xmath48 classification of ( 1609 ) brenda , the @xmath48 class turns out to be a subgroup of the @xmath26 complex in our principal components analysis .",
    "of course , we are aware that @xmath26 class asteroids are expected to be quite distinct from @xmath48 class objects in terms of thermal history and composition . @xmath48 class asteroids have featureless and very reddish spectra , and are most common among jupiter trojans , whereas they are relatively less common in the main belt .",
    "a numerical simulation performed by @xcite showed that these bodies may have originated from trans - neptunian region as a result of the violent dynamical evolution of the giant - planet orbits as suggested by the so - called nice model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , results of @xcite suggest an inner boundary for this type of objects around @xmath49  au , while asteroid ( 1609 ) brenda has a semi - major axis of about @xmath50  au . in any case",
    ", we do not rule out the possibility that either the taxonomic classification of ( 1609 ) brenda could be wrong , or it may be an interloper in the gersuind family .",
    "reflectance spectra are available also for two members of the myriostos family .",
    "the asteroid ( 344 ) desiderata turns out to be a @xmath27 , while ( 1246 ) chaka belongs to the @xmath26-class .",
    "according to sdss colors , the members of this family belong to the @xmath27/@xmath28 complex , in agreement with spectral evidence for ( 344 ) desiderata .",
    "therefore , it is likely that ( 1246 ) chaka is an interloper .",
    "finally , the @xmath27-class asteroid ( 3037 ) alku is probably an interloper within the @xmath26-type ( 29905 ) @xmath37 family .    at least in some cases ,",
    "very similar values of the principal components among two groups might suggest a common origin , like , for example , in the case of higson family and the ( 28884 ) @xmath44 clump .",
    "they are very close in terms of principal components , and merge at a distance cut - off of @xmath51  m / s in the space of proper elements .",
    "this might well be a first example of spectroscopic confirmation of a genetic relation between a family and an associated clump .",
    "however , available data are not sufficient to draw definite conclusion in this respect , but we think that new observations can provide interesting results in the future .    in the outer region almost all identified groups belong to the @xmath27/@xmath28 complex .",
    "there are only two exceptions .",
    "the eucharis and kartvelia families belong to the @xmath26 complex .",
    "interestingly , the eucharis family is located in a quite peculiar location at the far edge of the @xmath26 dominion in the ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) plane ( see fig .  [",
    "f : new_pc_fam ] ) , ruling out any possibility that it might have anything to do with the @xmath27/@xmath28 complex .",
    "although we can not distinguish clearly between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 complex in our sdss analysis , some indication about a preferred location for the @xmath27 complex can be drawn .",
    "in particular , most families in the outer belt seem to cluster around a single sub - dominion of the ( @xmath33,@xmath35 ) portion of plane occupied by the @xmath27/@xmath28 complexes .",
    "available spectral types are consistent with this conclusion . the asteroids ( 350 )",
    "ornamenta and ( 780 ) armenia belong to the @xmath27 class",
    ". moreover , two members of euphrosyne and four members of alauda that have available spectral types , are all consistent with the @xmath27 complex .",
    "the situation of the eucharis family is in some way unusual .",
    "four members of this family have known spectral types .",
    "two of them , including asteroid ( 181 ) eucharis itself , are @xmath28-class , whereas two are @xmath27-class .",
    "none of these objects is consistent with an @xmath26-class classification inferred for this family from our analysis of the sdss colors for the members of this family .",
    "since it belongs to the @xmath26 spectral class , which is relatively rare in the outer belt , the eucharis family can be clearly distinguished from nearby background asteroids .",
    "according to available sdss data , about @xmath54 of the eucharis family members identified in our analysis would be interlopers .",
    "this is an exceedingly large fraction with respect to usual situations @xcite and might be an indication of the presence of another separate family overlapping with eucharis . among the suspected interlopers",
    "there are several large asteroids such as ( 285 )  regina , ( 746 ) marlu , ( 1035 ) amata , and ( 29943 ) @xmath55 .",
    "the situation is made even more complicated by the fact that the eucharis family is located not far from some well known low - inclination families including ( 137 ) meliboea and ( 1400 ) tirela .",
    "further investigations , that we postpone for a future paper , are necessary to address these questions .",
    "in this paper a comprehensive search for asteroid families among the population of high - inclination asteroids has been presented .",
    "the search has been performed by applying the standard hierarchical clustering method to a sample of 10,265 numbered objects for which synthetic proper elements were taken from the _ astdys _ web site . to these",
    ", we added other 8,295 multi - opposition objects for which we computed synthetic proper elements .",
    "we included in our sample only asteroids having sine of proper inclination greater than @xmath0 .",
    "we considered three zones corresponding to three different intervals of proper semi - major axis ( inner , intermediate and outer region ) .",
    "we used the hcm to identify families in each zone . in doing so , we applied hcm in generally the same way as it was applied in the past for family searches among the low - inclination population .",
    "however , we also introduced some improvements in the procedure , to achieve a more reliable and robust classification , mainly for what concerns family membership .",
    "we also make a clear distinction between highly reliable groupings , that we call families , and more uncertain ones , that we call clumps .",
    "in addition , we call clusters some very compact groupings for which the number of objects is still low , but could increase in the future , as more and more objects will be discovered by observational surveys . the best example of cluster we found is a very compact eight - members grouping including ( 5438 ) lorre .",
    "we took advantage of available sdss moc  4 color data to improve family membership reliability and identify likely family interlopers . using principal component analysis , we classified all families into @xmath26 or @xmath27/@xmath28 taxonomic complexes .",
    "we found that taxonomical distribution of families matches very well a systematic variation of asteroid spectral type with respect to heliocentric distance .",
    "some exceptions exist , however , a very interesting case being that of the eucharis family .",
    "asteroid families identified here provide a wide range of opportunities for possible future studies related to high - inclination asteroids .",
    "our results are only the first step to fully understanding collisional evolution of this part of asteroid belt .",
    "there is a lot of work that should be done .",
    "for example , to study dynamical characteristics of proposed families , to estimate their ages , to find size - frequency distributions ( sfds ) of family members , to estimate the size of parent bodies , etc .",
    "these results should be than compared to those obtained for the classical main belt , what would allow us to understand how differently these two populations evolved . also , typical relative velocity among the high - inclination asteroids is about @xmath56  km / s @xcite , while in the classical belt it is only about @xmath22  km / s @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to see how sfds of high - inclination families fit in numerical experiments @xcite .    among the individual cases as a particularly interesting to study we highlight the possibly interplay among eucharis , meliboea and tirela families .",
    "different chronology methods @xcite could be successfully applied to these groupings .",
    "some of the studies mentioned above are already possible with existing data , while some others will be possible in the near future .",
    "different observational surveys will provide physical characteristics ( e.g. albedos , rotational periods , diameters , spectral types ) for many asteroids , including these on highly inclined orbits . among these surveys let us mention here one just finished , wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , and one planned to be launched in 2013 , global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics ( gaia ) .",
    "other surveys , like this presented recently by @xcite , could provide valuable data as well .",
    "the results of this investigation open also perspectives for new , dedicated observing campaigns . in particular , we mention the interesting case of the pallas family , which certainly deserves some further spectroscopic investigations in the visible and near - ir , as already suggested by @xcite . moreover , polarimetric observations of the anacostia and watsonia families in the middle region , might likely lead to discover new examples of `` barbarians '' .",
    "observations of small compact clusters like lorre might be highly welcome as well .",
