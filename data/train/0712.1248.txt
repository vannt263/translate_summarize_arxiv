    "past experimental studies have pictured the linear optical properties of quantum wells in the presence of a moderate background electron density .",
    "they showed that the exciton resonance is strongly affected by the electron population .",
    "first of all electrons screen the excitons and reduce their oscillator strength @xcite .",
    "then , they fill up the conduction band and contribute to shift the exciton resonance towards higher energies @xcite . finally they collide with electrons and broaden their absorption line @xcite .",
    "experimental comparison between exciton - electron and exciton - exciton scattering mechanism in bulk gaas @xcite , and in gaas quantum wells @xcite , showed that the exciton - electron scattering efficiency is one order of magnitude larger than exciton - exciton process .",
    "both scattering processes are enhanced for the two - dimensional excitons as compared to bulk excitons .",
    "linear optical spectrum of modulation - doped quantum wells also features a charged exciton ( trion ) resonance below the exciton resonance @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of the binding energy of charged excitons were performed using variational @xcite and full solution of the three - particle schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "they showed that only the singlet state is bound in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "considering the lineshape of the trion resonance , it was argued that the momentum of the electron initially present in semiconductor and used in the absorption process of a trion yields a low - energy tail on the trion resonance @xcite .",
    "a simple derivation of the trion - electron scattering was also performed in gaas quantum wells @xcite , but the overlap of the exciton and trion resonances did not allow clearing identifying if such simple model leads to correct predictions .    in this paper , we investigate the effect of a two - dimensional electron gas on the optical properties of cdte quantum wells . due to the large energy separation between exciton and trion resonances",
    ", we are able to evidence experimentally the existence of a high - energy tail of both exciton and trion resonances .",
    "an electron - exciton and electron - trion scattering model , taking into account both elastic and inelastic scattering processes , show quantitative agreement with our experimental linear spectra .",
    "these findings , even being yet far , can go in the direction of the modern theory of excitons within an electron gas , that argue that a trion is intrinsically a many - body object , made of a hole interacting with all electrons in the system @xcite .",
    "we use also time- and spectrally- resolved pump - probe experiments to investigate the effect of scattering of electrons with trion and excitons on the nonlinear reflectivity spectra .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : we give the sample characteristics in sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] . after presenting the measured reflectivity spectra of the sample in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , we show , in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] , that a calculation without exciton- and trion - electron scatterings can not possibly describe our system .",
    "[ sec : scattering ] summarizes the exciton - electron and trion - electron calculation results and we demonstrate that linear optical spectra of modulation - doped quantum wells are quantitatively described by a matrix transfer calculation including both exciton- and trion - electron scatterings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tr - experiment ] using time - resolved pump - probe experiment we illustrate the effect of the electron population on the exciton and trion lineshapes .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we worked on a one - side modulation doped cdte / cd@xmath0mg@xmath1te heterostructure @xcite , containing a single cdte quantum well of 8 nm between 50 nm thickness barriers .",
    "this structure was grown on top of a 4.5 mm of cdte which is deposited above a gaas substrate . a remote donor layer of iodine with thikness of 49 was embedded in the cap layer 10 nm apart from the quantum well , yielding a population of about @xmath2  @xmath3 excess electrons in the qw .",
    "the electrons from the donors can either fall in the quantum well or be trapped by surface states , both processes competing . in this regime , at temperature of 5 k , two strong resonances separated by 3 mev arise below the band gap ; they are attributed to heavy - hole excitons ( 1625.7 mev ) and negatively charged excitons ( trions , 1622.4 mev ) .",
    "a control of the electron density can be achieved by illuminating the sample with light more energetic than the energy gap of the barrier , i. e. larger than 2.03 ev . in this case , we create electron - hole pairs in the barrier .",
    "holes are attracted by electrons trapped in the surface states , while electrons are repelled towards the quantum well . by increasing the light intensity",
    ", we can increase the electron gas density .",
    "for instance , the practical electron concentration range from @xmath4  @xmath3 to @xmath5  @xmath3 is attained .",
    "the thickness of the barriers was chosen in such a way that reflectivity spectra are absorption - like and can be directly interpreted .",
    "we performed reflectivity measurements of the sample at temperature of 5 k. a white light source was spectrally filtered so that any high energy component ( @xmath6 ev ) likely to modify the density of the electron gas in the quantum well was suppressed .",
    "the light was collimated and focused on the sample .",
    "the reflection was then spectrally resolved by an imaging monochromator and recorded by a ccd camera .",
    "we kept the incident light intensity low and made sure we were working in linear regime .",
    "the light coming from a blue gan light emitting diode ( led ) was focused on the sample and completely covered the white light spot . by monitoring the intensity of the blue led we could change the density of electrons in the well .",
    "the diffusion time of electrons from the barrier to the quantum well is macroscopic ; it usually took 5 s to 15 s for the system to reach equilibrium whenever the led power was tuned .",
    "reflectivity spectra were recorded for various electron densities .",
    "cw reflectivity spectra obtained at 5 k for different electron densities ranging from @xmath4  @xmath3 to @xmath7  @xmath3 . ]",
    "figure 1 shows the reflectivity spectra obtained for different electron densities . for increasing electron densities",
    ", we clearly observe a blue shift of the exciton resonance as reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is due to the filling of the conduction band by electrons .",
    "electron - hole pairs can only be photo - generated above the fermi level . to a good approximation ,",
    "the shift is linear in the fermi energy @xmath8 .",
    "thus the exciton - trion energy difference is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the trion binding energy and @xmath11 is an empirical parameter .",
    "for cdte quantum wells , @xmath12 @xcite . assuming that @xmath13 mev",
    ", we estimate the electron concentrations in the quantum well for each spectrum in fig .",
    "1 . the densities that we obtained range from @xmath4  @xmath3 to @xmath7  @xmath3 .    we note that in the measured spectra , also a high energy tail of exciton and trion resonances develops as the electron density increases .",
    "we will show that this finding can only be explained by considering electron interactions with excitons and trions .",
    "as a starting point , we chose to use the linear susceptibility proposed by @xcite in the framework of density matrix theory .",
    "it includes both exciton and trion contributions , has a rather simple form and takes into account the nonzero momentum of the excess electron in the quantum well used in the process of trion photogeneration .",
    "we emphasize that it neglects any scattering with electrons .",
    "it reads      where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the contributions to the exciton and trion susceptibility .",
    "they are given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath18 ) is the exciton resonance energy , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) a contribution to the exciton ( trion ) oscillator strength , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the exciton ( trion ) homogenous broadening mainly due to phonons ; @xmath23 is the fermi - dirac distribution of the electrons and @xmath24 is a correction to the trion resonance that comprises trion center of mass energy and electron initial momentum @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the electron , exciton and trion effective mass , respectively . for a given initial electron momentum ,",
    "the strength of the integrant is weighted by the optical matrix element @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the trion @xmath32 wavefunction , with @xmath33 the relative position of the first electron to the hole and @xmath34 from the second electron to the hole .    for the trion wavefunction , we relied on a simple variational function @xcite with only two variational parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normalization factor .",
    "with this approximation , the light coupling element @xmath39 becomes @xmath40    we evaluated , in appendix c , the error induce by using the chandrashekar s wavefunction . in fig .",

    "they do not differ much and we conclude that eq .",
    "[ eq : mt ] is a reliable approximation .",
    "exciton and trion resonance may also be inhomogenously broadened , due to quantum well interface roughness .",
    "building on @xcite work , we supposed that the broadening can be described by a gaussian distribution function .",
    "thus , for excitons , we substituted the dielectric susceptibility ( [ eq : chixt1 ] ) by the convolution function @xmath41\\notag\\\\     & = \\frac{i\\pi f_x |\\phi_x(0)|^2}{\\gamma_\\text{inhom}^x}w\\left(\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_x - i\\gamma_x}{\\gamma_\\text{inhom}^x}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the complex error function @xcite and @xmath43 the exciton inhomogenous broadening constant . for trions the same kind of equation holds , except the convolution",
