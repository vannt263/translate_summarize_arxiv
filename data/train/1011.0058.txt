    "for more than a decade , the gdh and a2 collaborations have been carrying out intense experimental studies aimed at the verification of the famous gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule  @xcite . a comprehensive overview concerning the status of these experiments",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the gdh sum rule gives an integral relation between anomalous magnetic moment @xmath7 of a spin-@xmath8 particle and the difference of the total photoabsorption cross sections with parallel , @xmath9 , and antiparallel , @xmath10 , photon and target spin alignments and reads [ gdh ]  s= ^_0  de _ , where @xmath11 is the photon laboratory energy , @xmath12 is the particle mass , and @xmath13",
    ". equation ( [ gdh ] ) shows that ground - state properties given by @xmath7 and @xmath12 are related to the energy - weighted excitation spectrum of the particle .",
    "the gdh sum rule relies on the basic physics principles of lorenz and gauge invariance , unitarity , crossing symmetry , and an unsubtracted dispersion relation applied to the forward compton amplitude .",
    "therefore , measurements of the right - hand side ( rhs ) of this equation can serve as a fundamental cross - check of these principles .    the left - hand side ( lhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ gdh ] ) for the proton is @xmath14  @xmath6b .",
    "the integrand in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ gdh ] ) at energies from 0.2 to 2.9 gev was determined by the gdh and a2 collaborations in a series of experiments with circularly polarized photons and longitudinally polarized protons  @xcite .",
    "involving theoretical predictions from threshold to 0.2 gev and above 2.9  gev , the gdh group obtained for the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ gdh ] ) @xmath15  @xmath6b , which is in good agreement with the gdh sum rule prediction .",
    "the check of the isospin structure of the gdh sum rule requires measurements on the neutron .",
    "however , because of the absence of a stable , dense , free - neutron target , direct measurements for the neutron are impossible so that information on the neutron can be extracted from deuteron data .",
    "experiments with circularly polarized photons and longitudinally polarized deuterons were also performed by the gdh and a2 collaborations  @xcite as well as by the legs collaboration  @xcite .",
    "in fact , however , a contribution to the neutron gdh integral from deuteron data was extracted only in ref .",
    "@xcite and therewith in the limited energy range of 8151825 mev .",
    "the extraction procedure relied mainly on an assumption that at these energies the incoherent , quasi - free meson production reactions dominate ; i.e. if one supposes that the equality @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is valid .",
    "such an assumption seems to be in general agreement with the results obtained by arenhvel , fix , and schwamb ( afs )  @xcite . using theoretical predictions for the unmeasured energy regions , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained the value of @xmath18  @xmath6b for the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ gdh ] ) which is in agreement with the gdh sum rule value of @xmath19  @xmath6b .",
    "of course , this agreement should not be considered as an experimental verification of the gdh sum rule for the neutron , because the net experimental contribution to this value is only about @xmath20 .",
    "the helicity - dependent cross section on the deuteron in the energy range @xmath21  mev was also measured in ref .",
    "@xcite . combining the obtained data with those from ref .",
    "@xcite and using again the assumption on the incoherency of the proton and neutron contributions in the range @xmath22  mev , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained the value of @xmath23  @xmath6b in this range .",
    "the said assumption seems to be rather rough below , say , 500 mev , where the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 reactions contribute to the polarized total cross section , nevertheless , the extracted value indicates that the gdh integrals for the proton and neutron are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "together with the verification of the gdh sum rule for the neutron , the helicity - dependent cross sections on the deuteron are also required to test this sum rule for the deuteron itself .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the deuteron is very small ( @xmath26  nm ) because , first , the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron are almost equal in magnitude but opposite in sign and , second , nucleon spins in the deuteron are predominantly parallel . in view of this , the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ gdh ] ) for the deuteron is @xmath27  @xmath6b , which is more than two orders smaller than the nucleon values .",
    "therefore , there should be large negative contributions almost totally canceling the nucleon contribution .",
    "this point was discussed for the first time in ref .",
    "it was found that a huge negative contribution amounting to about @xmath28  @xmath6b indeed exists and stems from the deuteron photodisintegration reaction .",
    "later on , a comprehensive analysis of different channels in the deuteron gdh integral was performed within the afs framework  @xcite .",
    "they evaluated effects from deuteron photodisintegration and single and double - pion production as well as from single-@xmath29 production with the total result of @xmath30  @xmath6b .",
    "if one intends to extract the neutron value for the gdh integral from deuteron data or verify the deuteron gdh sum rule , in either case one has to be confident that theoretical models used in analyses of these data provide reliable descriptions of the helicity - dependent cross sections for different reactions on the deuteron .",
    "as was found in refs .",
    "@xcite , a large contribution to the deuteron gdh integral stems from incoherent single - pion production @xmath4 .",
    "intense experimental investigations of the reaction @xmath31 have recently been performed by the gdh and a2 collaborations  @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite have provided data on the helicity - dependent total inclusive and semiexclusive cross sections in the energy range from 200 to 800  mev . in the very recent work of the same collaborations  @xcite , the helicity dependence of the differential cross section in the @xmath31 channel has been measured for the first time in the @xmath32 region .",
    "there are also measurements of the helicity - dependent total cross section of the reaction @xmath33",
    "@xcite , where @xmath34 ( the incoherent channel ) or @xmath35 ( the coherent channel ) .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to analyze the data of refs .",
    "@xcite on the @xmath31 reaction in the framework of the diagrammatic model built in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work , we restricted ourselves to the discussion of unpolarized and single spin - dependent observables due to the lack of data on double spin - dependent observables at the time when the work was being prepared .",
    "it was found that the model  @xcite provided a quite satisfactory description of all available data except for the unpolarized differential and total cross sections in the @xmath36 channel for which the data were notably overestimated . in the present work ,",
    "we compare predictions of the approach  @xcite to the polarized data from refs .",
    "@xcite with special emphasis on the model dependence of our results .",
    "sources for theoretical uncertainties are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which the interested reader is referred .    another principal goal of this work is to evaluate the contribution from the @xmath4 channel to the deuteron gdh integral .",
    "this task requires an extension of the model up to about 1.52  gev .",
    "although in ref .",
    "@xcite we restricted our consideration to the @xmath32 resonance region , the model is applicable at higher energies , too . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can expect that in the framework of the diagrammatic approach , contributions due to @xmath1 and @xmath2 final state interaction ( fsi ) are reliably calculated up to a photon energy of 800  mev .",
    "taking into account that these contributions are small above 500 mev , they can obviously be disregarded for @xmath37  mev .",
    "hence , the upper limit for the applicability of the model depends on that for the impulse approximation ( ia ) which , in turn , depends on the applicability domain of an employed elementary operator @xmath3 of pion production on the nucleon . in the framework of the approach  @xcite",
    ", this operator is taken from multipole analyses said  @xcite and maid  @xcite and can be used up to 2  gev for the first analysis and up to 1.65  gev for the second one .    the contribution from the @xmath4 channel to the gdh integral up to @xmath38",
    "gev was evaluated in the afs approach  @xcite , but the sensitivity of obtained results to the @xmath3 operator was not investigated in that work .",
    "an analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the value of the integral at integration up to 350  mev manifests its considerable dependence on the elementary operator . because the energy domain from threshold to 350  mev provides only about a half of the total contribution of this reaction to the deuteron gdh integral , it is of high interest to recognize how sensitive the total integral is to the @xmath3 operator . in the present paper ,",
    "we evaluate the integral up to a photon energy of @xmath39  gev and investigate a question of possible theoretical uncertainties for its value .",

    "the importance of diagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ 2loops ] at threshold energies is that it contains , together with the @xmath82 scattering amplitude , a block with charged pion photoproduction from the nucleon .",
    "the dominating threshold electric dipole amplitude @xmath84 for the charged channels is about 20 times larger in absolute numbers than that for the neutral channels . for analogous reasons",
    "we also expect that a two - loop diagram  [ 2loops](b ) with @xmath1 rescattering in the intermediate state and @xmath2 rescattering in the final state may also be important near threshold .",
    "therefore , the fact that the model including only three contributions shown in figs .  [ diagrams](a)(c ) can be used for the description of the @xmath36 reaction at threshold energies is not obvious , and further study is needed to clarify this point .",
    "there is one more two - loop diagram , shown in fig .  [ 2loops](c ) , which includes two blocks with @xmath2 scattering . because the @xmath2 scattering lengths are about two orders smaller than those for @xmath1 scattering , the role of this diagram in the threshold region is expected to be much smaller than that of diagrams  [ 2loops](a ) and [ 2loops](b ) .",
    "one can anticipate the effect from the above two - loop diagrams to decrease together with increasing @xmath11 when the mentioned enhancement due to the charge pion exchange disappears .",
    "nevertheless , to be fully confident in the smallness of such contributions , their explicit evaluations are needed .",
    "this task , however , is expected to be very difficult , because as we have learned evaluating diagram  [ 2loops](a ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , practical calculations are extremely time consuming especially when the inclusive processes are considered , and , therefore , integrations over momenta of final particles have to be carried out .",
    "note that in the case of the exclusive channels , the kinematic regions exist where the diagrams in figs .",

    "it is compatible with the data errors of ref .",

    "figure  [ stot_charged ] shows also that our results are in good agreement with these of afs up to the peak position at about 320 mev , but at higher energies our cross sections overestimate the afs results .",

    "however , the striking distinction from the unpolarized case is that now the model reasonably reproduces all the data not only those at @xmath130 .",
    "this might indicate that the above overestimation in the unpolarized yield is due to an overestimation in both @xmath140 and @xmath141 , but it disappears in the difference @xmath139 .",

    "[ pi0pol ] that the dependence of @xmath142 on the elementary operator is weak below 350 mev , but it becomes quite visible at higher energies .",

    "we do not discuss here the shape of the angular behavior of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 components in the yield and differential cross section because the corresponding analysis has already been performed in ref .",
    "as shown in that work , this behavior can be interpreted in terms of pion photoproduction on single nucleons , and it is a consequence of the dominance of quasi - free reaction mechanisms .",
    "let us discuss now the contribution of the @xmath4 reaction to the deuteron gdh integral and compare our results with those obtained in refs .  .",

    "@xcite , the behavior of the difference repeats mainly that for the elementary reaction @xmath3 with some distortion due to nuclear effects .",
    "for instance , the negative value of @xmath160 in the charged channels at threshold energies is because of the dominance of the @xmath84 multipole producing the antiparallel transition .",

    "the upper limit of 1.5 gev is chosen in accordance with an option from ref .",
    "@xcite . taking into account the theoretical uncertainties",

    "one can see that our value for the @xmath77 channel exceeds that of afs by about @xmath168 .",
    "note here that the use of the said parametrization allows one to extend the upper limit in the gdh integral up to 2 gev .",
    "with such an extension we have not found any visible changes in the result for 1.5 gev .",
    "this means that the @xmath122 term in the deuteron gdh integral essentially reaches convergence at these energies .",
    "the evaluation of the gdh integral , integrated up to 350 mev , has been performed in ref .",

    "they are more pronounced in the charged channels , especially in the @xmath136 one .",
    "this considerable dependence of the results is mainly due to the multipole analyses , but the effect of a choice of the invariant amplitudes is also quite visible . note that the noticeable dependence of the nucleon gdh integral evaluated with the said and maid analyses was found in refs .",

    "it is worth mentioning that within the uncertainties of @xmath176  @xmath6b , the afs result of @xmath30  @xmath6b  @xcite for the total contribution to this integral for the deuteron is compatible with the gdh sum rule prediction of @xmath27  @xmath6b .",
    "the central aim of the present work is the study of the @xmath177 reaction with the polarized photon and deuteron and its contribution to the gdh sum rule for the deuteron . to evaluate the reaction amplitude ,",

    "particular emphasis has been placed on the discussion of possible uncertainties introduced into the model by this operator .",
    "comparing our results with the recent experimental data obtained by the gdh and a2 collaborations in the energy domain from 300 to 450  mev  @xcite , we have rediscovered a known problem consisting in the sizable overestimation of the unpolarized data for the neutral channel . at the same time , the unpolarized data for the charged channels are reasonably reproduced .",
    "we have found that the helicity - dependent differential yield difference @xmath139 for the neutral channel and differential cross section difference @xmath178 for the charged channels are reproduced fairly well .",
    "also , the model provides a quite satisfactory description of the separate parallel and antiparallel yields and cross sections in all the channels .",
