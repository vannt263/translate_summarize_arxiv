    "starting with the seminal work of mandelbrot about cotton price @xcite , several studies of financial stock prices times series , have allowed to exhibit some particularities of their fluctuations . without making a comprehensive list",
    ", we can mention the appearance in empirical data of the following properties : non gaussian distributions due to now well known fat tails of financial returns , the so - called volatility clustering that means that the volatility fluctuations are of intermittent and correlated nature , scaling invariance , long run correlation in volatility , leverage effect and so on ( see e.g @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "thus , constructing theoretical models for financial returns that include all the properties listed before appears as a very interesting challenge .",
    "many scientific works , in economics or mathematics , proposed various models for asset returns . the arch model introduced by engle @xcite offers an interesting base of work , and after the seminar work by engle a vast literature on arch and related models has been developed .",
    "one of the first extensions of the arch model , called the garch model , has been introduced by bollerslev in @xcite and it also has been the object of various generalizations .",
    "while the garch models are capable of capturing volatility clustering , there are some drawbacks of the model . for example",
    ", the garch models are unable to represent volatility asymmetry . due to the presence of the squared",
    "observed data in the conditional variance equation , the positive and negative values of the lagged innovations have the same effect on the conditional variance . in the finance literature , it has been noticed that volatility often is affected by negative and positive shocks in different ways .",
    "another inconvenient of the garch model is the fact that , to ensure positiveness of the conditional variance , non - negative constraints on the coefficients in the variance equation must be imposed . to take into account the asymmetric effects on conditional second moments and to avoid the non - negativity constraints on the coefficients in the variance equation , in @xcite",
    "the so - called egarch model has been proposed by d. nelson .    on the other hand , many recent empirical studies , based on huge data sets available nowadays , put in light new aspects of the financial returns .",
    "for example , they suggested that the fluctuations of the asset process displays multifractal properties ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account these multifractal character , several authors proposed models based on the on `` cascade '' random processes and `` multifractal random walk ( mrw ) '' .",
    "we refer , among others , to @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "usually , the noise in these models are defined by @xmath0 ) , \\hskip0.5 cm t\\in \\mathbb{r}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a multifractal random measure and @xmath2 is a self - similar process with stationary increments , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "another construction defines the noise via a stochastic integral as ( see e.g. @xcite , see @xcite ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a suitable fractal noise and @xmath2 is a self - similar process with stationary increments , independent of @xmath4 . a natural choice for the process @xmath2 , both in ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , is the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) .",
    "while these multifractal models ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) are able to capture several properties observed on the empirical data ( scaling , volatility clustering or long - range dependance ) , they reproduce poorly the leverage effect .",
    "the leverage effect is understood as the correlation between the log - return at a fixed time @xmath5 and his volatility ( that may be defined as the squared or absolute log - return ) varying around @xmath5 , for example @xmath6 .",
    "empirical studies ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) have shown that this quantity is close to 0 for past volatility and follow an exponential law for future volatility .",
    "this stylized fact is interpreted as a panic effect , the two quantities are negatively correlated just after @xmath5 and go back quickly to 0 as @xmath7 increases .",
    "we introduce here a generalization of the model ( [ 2 ] ) , able to take into account the leverage effect and allows a more flexibility for long - range dependence in log - return .",
    "that is , in the model ( [ 2 ] ) we will consider the processes @xmath4 to be multifractal process called `` infinitely divisible cascading noise '' and the process @xmath2 to be a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath8 . the same situation has been treated in @xcite , @xcite , but in addition , we construct a model in which the processes @xmath4 and @xmath9 are not independent anymore . an alternative construction has been proposed in @xcite but in this reference the integral in ( [ 2 ] ) is not a true stochastic integral with respect to the fbm .",
    "we will define the integral ( [ 2 ] ) using the techniques of the malliavin calculus and we will study the properties of the fractional multifractal random walk .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains some preliminaries on multifractal process and the basic elements of the malliavin calculus that we will need in our paper . in section 3",
    "we analyze the stochastic integrals that are used to define the mrw while in section 4 we study the existence of the fractional mrw as a limit of a family of stochastic integrals .",
    "the properties of the fractional mrw ( scaling , moments etc ) are discussed in section 5 . the last section ( section 6 )",
    "contains a numerical analysis of the data for several financial indices and we compare the simulation of our theoretical model with the real data .",
    "we present here he basic facts related to the infinitely divisible cascading noises and we introduce the basic tools of the malliavin calculus .",
    "let @xmath10 denote an infinitely divisible , independently scattered random measure on the set @xmath11 with generating infinitely divisible distribution @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 for some function @xmath14 and for every @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 has control measure @xmath16 on @xmath17 meaning that for every borel set @xmath18 it holds @xmath19 the fact that @xmath10 is independently scattered means that the random variables @xmath20 are independent whenever the borel sets @xmath21 are disjoint .",
    "we define the _ infinitely divisible cascading noise _ ( irc ) by @xmath22 for every @xmath23 and @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the cone in @xmath17 defined by @xmath26    we will use the following facts throughout our paper .",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite for the their proofs . first , let us note the scaling property of the moments of the irc @xmath27 and the expression of its covariance : for every @xmath23 and @xmath28 @xmath29 where we denoted by for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 and by @xmath32    the scaling of the moment of @xmath4 can be extended to the following scaling property in distribution : for @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 means equivalence of finite dimensional distributions . here",
    "@xmath36 denotes a random variable independent by @xmath4 , which satisfies , if the measure @xmath16 is given by ( [ m ] ) , @xmath37    as noticed in @xcite , we have @xmath38    in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the _ multifractal random walk _ ( mrw ) based on fractional brownian motion is defined as limit when @xmath39 ( in some sense ) of the family of stochastic integrals @xmath40 defined by @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42}$ ] is a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath43 . the fractional brownian motion @xmath44}$ ] with hurst parameter @xmath45 is a centered gaussian process starting from zero with covariance function @xmath46.\\ ] ] in @xcite it is assumed that @xmath10 and @xmath9 * are independent . *",
    "therefore the stochastic integral with respect to @xmath9 in ( [ zrt ] ) behaves mainly as a wiener integral since , because of the independence , the integrand @xmath47 can be viewed as deterministic function for the integrator @xmath9 .",
    "another important fact in the development of this theory is that the irc @xmath4 is a martingale with respect to the argument @xmath48 .",
    "let us recall the following result ( see @xcite ) :    for every @xmath49 the stochastic process @xmath50 is a martingale with respect to its own filtration . as a consequence , for every @xmath51 with @xmath52 it holds",

    "the adjoint of @xmath59 is denoted by @xmath69 and is called the divergence ( or skorohod ) integral .",

    "the main difficulty consists in the fact that , in our construction , the variables @xmath4 and @xmath9 are dependent . from the theoretical point of view , the malliavin calculus offers convenient techniques but thinks are complicated in from the practical point of view .          where the measure @xmath10 and the fbm @xmath251 are dependent .",
    "as throughout our paper , we choose @xmath10 to be the gaussian measure .",
    "consider a random variable @xmath252 such that @xmath253 .",
    "+ the first step consists in generating a sequence of random variables @xmath254 such that @xmath255 and @xmath256 are correlated and with gaussian distribution @xmath257 where the covariance matrix @xmath258 depending on the auto - correlation function @xmath259 .",
    "we consider the choice of @xmath260 from @xcite with @xmath261 decreasing with respect to @xmath262 .",
    "then , assuming that the matrix @xmath258 is positively definite , there exists a triangular matrix @xmath263 such that @xmath264 . in this way",
    ", the components of      let us explain the idea to simulate the integral ( [ contt ] ) .",
    "this integral is a divergence integral and in principle its simulation is difficult .",
    "but in our particular case , we can use the following approach .",
    "let @xmath266 a partition of the interval @xmath267 $ ]",
    ". in the dependent case ( meaning when @xmath268 and @xmath9 are independent ) , ( [ contt ] ) can be naturally approximated by    @xmath269 since the simulation of @xmath9 is well - known ( see e.g. @xcite for an explicit algorithm ) , we can generate the above sum . in the dependent case , using the integration by parts formula @xmath270 , @xmath69 being the skorohod integral with respect to @xmath135 ( see @xcite ) , the same sum can be expressed as @xmath271    @xmath272 where the scalar product is in the hilbert space associated to the fbm and , since @xmath273 is gaussian , @xmath274 is deterministic and it depends on the set @xmath138 ( more exactly on the intersection of @xmath138 and the interval ( 0,1 ) which is in principle very small ) .",
    "thus , a possibility to simulate ( [ contt ] ) is to approximate it by @xmath275 with suitable coefficients @xmath276 .",
    "@xmath281 and , for sake of simplicity and with no loss of generality , we assume that log - returns are centered , @xmath282=0 $ ] , thus , we can interpret the volatility as the squared log - returns .",
    "+ the construction of the proposed mrw allows us to verify several properties of stock market fluctuations , what we call stylized facts .",
    "the first two that we present are specific to the mrw , long memory in absolute log - return and in volatility ; the others are achieved thanks to our construction , leverage effect and long memory in return . + the random walk that we introduce in our work allows the conditional variance and the random noise , which is a fbm with hurst parameter @xmath8 , to be dependent .",
    "this dependence should involve the so - called leverage effect , that is , the correlation between the log - return at time @xmath5 and the squared log - return ( the volatility ) in the future .",
    "the case @xmath283 implies that the noise @xmath251 exhibits long - range dependence .",
    "this should involve a long - range dependence of the fluctuations of the financial time series .",
    "these facts ( leverage effect and long - range dependence ) will be checked on the data . actually the leverage effect is empirically observed on financial index such as the @xmath284 500 ( us market ) , nikkei 225 ( japan market ) , ftse 100 ( uk market ) , cac 40 ( french market ) etc .",
    "but it does not appear on the forex market and on the commodities , for example .",
    "we also notice the absence of auto - correlation in log - returns if we consider low frequency financial data but this auto - correlation structure clearly appears in the case of square or absolute log - returns .",
    "nevertheless , at high frequency , we observe a dependence relation which is going to be formed even for usual ( not squared and not absolute ) auto - correlation function .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) . + the data that we used in order to check the leverage effect and the long - range dependence come from s@xmath285p 500 index with a frequency of 15 seconds from 2012 - 02 - 28 to 2012 - 06 - 26 , 131011 points .",
    "we compare the characteristics of the s@xmath285p 500 index with the simulation of our multifractal random walk .",
    "as we mention , we compare our simulations with the data from the s@xmath285p 500 index .",
    "in fact , we only present the comparison for the auto - correlation function since the multifractal structure of the asset return distribution are already well known and well describe by standard multifractal random walk ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical results are presented in figures [ plotspy ] and [ plotreturn ] . to compare",
    ", we also present the simulation of the fractional mrw with @xmath286 .",
    "this value has been obtained by a classical r / s test .",

    "we could advance two main ideas to explain this small persistence in high frequency log - returns .",
    "first one is that all agents include information , good or bad news , in their investment strategies , but there may have some latencies in the response of investor and cause this auto - correlation .",
    "the second one can be cause by huge investors such as mutual fund who want to invest significant sums and place large order .",
    "they have to split their large order in a sequence of smaller orders to acquire the number of shares wanted , and then , could cause some persistence .",
    "a simple and current strategy to do that is called iceberg order , more sophisticate could be found in the theory of optimal trading. + the persistence of dependence for the log - returns it not easily observed , but the presence of the cluster of log - returns indicates basically that strong variations are followed by other strong variations .",
