    "automorphisms of irreducible symplectic or hyperkhler manifolds have recently been studied by numerous mathematicians pursuing varying objectives and using different techniques .",
    "a key to the understanding of the underlying geometry is usually played by understanding the induced action of an automorphism on the second integral cohomology : for any irreducible symplectic manifold @xmath1 the cohomology group @xmath2 carries a natural non - degenerate lattice structure and a weight - two hodge structure .",
    "an automorphism of @xmath1 preserves both these structures and we obtain a homomorphism of groups : @xmath3 it is this homomorphism that allows us to study the geometry of @xmath1 and its automorphisms using lattice theory .",
    "this has been done very successfully and extensively in the case of k3 surfaces . from the strong torelli theorem for k3 surfaces it follows that @xmath4 is injective in this case .",
    "thus , by passing from the geometric picture on to the lattice side , we do not lose any information and we can classify automorphisms using lattice theory .    when constructing the first examples of higher - dimensional irreducible symplectic manifolds , beauville ( cf .",
    "@xcite[prop .  10",
    "] ) soon realised that the injectivity of @xmath4 holds also true in the case of hilbert schemes of points on a k3 .",
    "this fact was applied by boissire@xmath5sarti ( @xcite ) to understand when an automorphism on such a hilbert scheme is induced by an automorphism of the surface , constituting a first step in the classification of automorphisms of hilbert schemes .",
    "these results should not lead to the idea that @xmath4 is injective in general .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for generalised kummer varieties of dimension @xmath6 the kernel of @xmath4 is generated by induced automorphisms coming from the underlying abelian surface , i.e. by translations by points of order @xmath7 and by @xmath8 .",
    "these automorphisms preserve the albanese fibres of the hilbert scheme of @xmath7 points on the surface and they surely act trivially on cohomology .",
    "thus , in general , @xmath9 is not trivial .",
    "but in the case of generalised kummer varieties we at least understand the action of the kernel very well .",
    "thus it is still possible to use lattice theory for an understanding of the automorphism group .",
    "a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the kernel of @xmath4 is the result by hassett@xmath5tschinkel stating that - as a group - this kernel is a deformation invariant of the manifold @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "@xcite[thm .  2.1 ] ) .",
    "it implies that we now know the group structure of @xmath9 for all manifolds of @xmath10}$]-type and of kummer - type .",
    "note , that for a general deformation of a generalised kummer variety we do not have an explicit construction of the automorphisms in @xmath9 .",
    "there are two more known deformation types of hyperkhler manifolds .",
    "the first examples in both cases have been constructed by ogrady ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the ten - dimensional example and @xcite for the example of dimension six ) .",
    "the main results of this article concern the kernel of the cohomological representation @xmath4 for manifolds which are deformation equivalent to these manifolds .    in particular , we prove the following two theorems :    let @xmath1 be a manifold of @xmath11-type",
    ". then @xmath4 is injective .",
    "let @xmath1 be a manifold of @xmath12-type .",
    "then @xmath13    let us outline the idea of the proofs of the theorems .",
    "the geometry of ogrady s examples is more complicated and less understood compared to the case of hilbert schemes of points or generalised kummers .",
    "therefore a detailed analysis was needed .",
    "in the ten - dimensional case we consider a relative compactified jacobian of degree four over a ( five - dimensional ) linear system of genus five curves on a k3 surface .",
    "its resolution of singularities is an irreducible symplectic manifold of @xmath11-type .",
    "there are two main ingredients to the proof of the injectivity of @xmath4 .",
    "first we show that every automorphism in @xmath9 acts fibrewise on the jacobian .",
    "secondly we prove that the relative theta divisor is rigid , thus must be preserved by any such automorphism .",
    "for the second step ( rigidity of the relative theta divisor ) we first prove that the relative theta divisor has the structure of a @xmath14-bundle . from this",
    "we deduce its rigidity using a criterion that should be known to the experts ( cf .  *   [ lem : lem_rigid ] * ) . we can then conclude that @xmath9 is trivial using the torelli theorem for jacobians .",
    "in the six - dimensional case we follow a similar idea , where this time the first step ( fibrewise action ) turns out to be easier to prove .",
    "note that the automorphism induced by @xmath8 on the abelian surface acts trivially on @xmath12 .",
    "the group @xmath9 is composed by automorphism induced by translation by two - torsion points on @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the underlying abelian surface and @xmath17 its dual .    as a last result we study the automorphisms in @xmath9 ( in the six - dimensional case ) more in detail .",
    "in particular , we study their fixed loci and conclude that it either consists of @xmath18 disjoint k3 surfaces ( @xmath19 cases , see *   [ prop : fixed_ta ] * and *   [ prop : fixed_l ] * ) , of @xmath20 disjoint @xmath21 surfaces ( @xmath22 cases ) or @xmath18 isolated fixed points ( the remaining @xmath23 cases ) .",
    "( for the last two situations see *   [ prop : fixed_mixed]*. )    we want to emphasise one more result  since it is a beautiful result on its own  which is a side product of the proof of the injectivity of @xmath4 for @xmath11 :    let @xmath24 be a @xmath21 surface being a double cover of @xmath25 ramified along a sextic curve admitting a unique tritangent",
    ". denote by @xmath26 the pullback of @xmath27 .",
    "then the rational map @xmath28 is injective .",
    "see *   [ prop : injective_curves ] * for details .",
    "the motivation to prove these results and to write this article grew out of the attempt to detect ( using lattice theory ) certain induced automorphisms ( on ogrady s manifolds ) that have been constructed by the authors in @xcite . using the article at hand we managed to state a lattice theoretic criterion",
    "to detect induced automorphisms on ogrady - type moduli spaces ( cf .",

    "since the class of the pullback @xmath90 is fixed by @xmath81 , we see that @xmath91 is @xmath81-equivariant , that is , @xmath81 maps fibres of @xmath91 to fibres . since generically these fibres are jacobians of smooth curves and  by the above lemma ",
    "the classes of the respective theta divisors are mapped to each other , the torelli theorem for jacobians yields an isomorphism of the underlying curves .",
    "we continue by showing that this already implies that @xmath81 acts fibrewise .",
    "we will therefore prove the following result which is interesting on its own .",

    "this can be seen as follows : let @xmath93 be a stable curve .",
    "the differential of @xmath94 at the point corresponding to @xmath84 is given as the coboundary map @xmath95 in the long exact cohomology sequence associated with the normal bundle sequence @xmath96 thus it is enough to prove @xmath97 this can be done using the same method as in the second half of the proof of proposition 1.2 in @xcite .",
    "the rational map @xmath94 has an indeterminacy locus of codimension at least two and can be extended to a morphism from a suitable blow up of @xmath73 .",
    "thus it is enough to prove injectivity along a divisor which is saturated in the fibres ( i.e.  a divisor @xmath60 such that @xmath98 .",
    "we will choose this divisor to be the symmetric square @xmath99 corresponding to reducible curves .",
    "the rational map @xmath100 is given as the symmetric square of the map @xmath101 .",
    "thus we have reduced the problem to showing that the latter map is injective . again , by blowing up @xmath102 we can extend this map to a proper morphism @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , the discussion in chapter 3c of @xcite shows that the exceptional locus in @xmath104 is mapped to the locus in @xmath105 of curves having an elliptic tail and thus its image is disjoint from the image of the locus of stable curves in @xmath102 .",
    "hence it is enough to prove injectivity in a single point ( inside the stable locus ) .",
    "since we assumed that @xmath71 is a sextic with a unique triple tangent , we will choose this single point to correspond to the double cover @xmath106 of this triple tangent .",
    "but now the uniqueness of this triple tangent ensures that @xmath106 ( as a member of @xmath102 ) is unique in its isomorphism class .",
    "thus @xmath81 acts fibrewise and fixes the class of the theta divisor . since",
    "the divisor @xmath83 is rigid , @xmath81 can not be given by translations on the fibres .",

    "in this section we give a detailed description of the geometry of a specific example of a moduli space whose albanese fibre is a manifold of @xmath12-type .",
    "we will use this description in the next section , and then later also in *   [ sec : fixed ] * to study the fixed locus of the automorphisms acting trivial on cohomology .    as in the ten dimensional case",
    "we will consider a relative compactified jacobian over a non - primitive linear system , i.e.  we start by considering a moduli space of sheaves @xmath47 with mukai vector @xmath43 of the form @xmath107 for an effective divisor class @xmath26 on an abelian surface @xmath16 and an integer @xmath108 .",
    "such a moduli space comes with a fibration @xmath109 over the continuous system @xmath110 .",
    "note that in the case of abelian surfaces the @xmath17-component of the albanese map @xmath111 factors via @xmath91 and the natural isotrivial fibration @xmath112 with fibre the linear system @xmath73 .",

    "we will study the fibres of the restricted fibration map @xmath117 according to the stratification of the linear system @xmath73 and finally the fibre of the restriction of the albanese map .",
    "an important tool in the study of the relative jacobian is the following classical observation : the linear system @xmath73 on @xmath16 defines a degree two map @xmath118 .",
    "the image is the singular ( quartic ) kummer surface @xmath119 .",
    "if @xmath84 is a curve in @xmath73 , then its image @xmath120 is a quartic curve in @xmath121 ( of arithmetic genus @xmath122 ) .",

    "we start by recalling rapagnetta s result ( cf .",
    "2.1.3 ) ) on the stratification of @xmath73 .",
    "the strata form quasi - projective subvarieties of @xmath73 ; thus we will indicate their relation to the dual of @xmath119 .",
