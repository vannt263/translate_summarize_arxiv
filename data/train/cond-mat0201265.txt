    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) was first observed in dilute ultracold alkali atoms of rubidium @xcite , lithium @xcite and sodium @xcite .",

    "ensher et al .",
    "measured the condensate fraction and the energy of rubidium atoms @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the transition temperature @xmath7 is shifted not only by the interaction effect but also by the finite size effect by a few percent , where @xmath7 denotes the transition temperature of the noninteracting bose gas within the external field in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this means that both the interaction and the finite size effects play an important role in the real bose gases .",
    "in fact , the number of trapped atoms is typically @xmath8 , and this may not be sufficiently large to take the thermodynamic limit .",
    "+ on the other hand , these experimental findings have stimulated much interest in the theory of the interacting bose gas .",
    "since bec occurs when atoms are dilute and cold , we can treat the interaction of atoms as the two - body interaction . in this case",
    ", the s - wave scattering length characterizes the strength of the two - body interaction . under these conditions , the gross pitaevskii",
    "( gp ) equation can well describe the behavior of the interacting bose gas at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this is a mean field approach for the order parameter associated with the condensate . using the gp equation , several authors studied the ground state and the excitation properties of the condensate @xcite .",
    "+ to study bec at finite temperature , the gp equation at zero temperature was extended by griffin @xcite .",
    "it is called the hartree fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory . in particular ,",
    "popov approximation to the hfb theory has been employed to explain the experimental results @xcite .",
    "+ in the realistic point of view , bec experiments are carried out in magnetic traps .",
    "in this situation , spin - polarized atoms interact through a triplet potential . as long as atoms remain polarized",
    ", they can not form molecules . for alkali atoms ,",
    "the triplet potential has many bound states which allow them to recombine into molecules . since this recombination can only occur in a three - body scattering",
    ", it can not occur for sufficiently low density of atoms .",
    "thus , the two - body scattering is dominant . therefore , spin - polarized atoms can remain the gas through dipole two - body scattering which flip the spin to untrapped state , and then atoms can produce bec . in this sense , it is of particular importance to find a way to investigate bec with more realistic interactions .",
    "+ in this paper , we study bec for an arbitrary power low interaction @xmath0 which is more realistic than the ordinary contact interaction ( @xmath9-function ) .",
    "this interaction plays an important role for alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "the atomic interaction @xmath10 of alkali atoms can be approximately written as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the central force of the interaction .",
    "further , @xmath12 can be written in terms of the electron exchange interaction @xmath13 and the dispersion force @xmath14 .",
    "the magnetic - dipole interaction @xmath15 and the hyperfine interaction @xmath16 behave like @xmath4 , where the coupling constant @xmath5 is the spin part of the interaction .",
    "the last two terms , @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the zeeman interaction and the spin - orbit interaction , respectively .",
    "these interactions are important at high density . + here , we study bose gas interacting through the van der waals @xmath3 plus @xmath4 interactions . we show that the ground state under this interaction is stable if the ratio of the coupling constants is larger than that of the critical curve .",
    "we find that the @xmath4 term plays an important role to stabilize the ground state when the density of atoms becomes large at low temperature .",
    "using the numerical values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we confirm that the ground state of alkali atoms are stable .",
