    "nonextensive statistical mechanics ( nsm ) @xcite and extensive generalized power - law statistics @xcite are based on the mathematical generalization of the boltzmann exponential distribution , namely : @xmath4 whereas in @xcite , the power - law distribution , @xmath5^{1/(1-q)}$ ] , obeys the tsallis distribution of nsm @xcite , the so - called @xmath0-statistics @xcite provides a power - law distribution function and the @xmath0-entropy which emerges in the context of the special relativity and in the _ kinetic interaction principle_. formally , the @xmath0-framework is defined by considering the expressions @xmath6 @xmath7 where the @xmath0-entropy associated with @xmath0-statistics is given by @xcite @xmath8 the expressions above reduce to the standard results in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath0-statistics lead to a * generalized framework * with interesting mathematical properties @xcite , as well as a connection with the generalized smoluchowski equation @xcite and the relativistic nuclear equation of state for nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that it is possible to obtain a consistent form for the entropy which is linked with a two - parameter deformation of the logarithm function and generalizes the tsallis , abe and kaniadakis logarithm behaviours @xcite . * some physical systems",
    "are well approximated by a distribution that maximizes kaniadakis entropy * , namely , cosmic ray flux , rain events in meteorology @xcite , quark - gluon plasma @xcite , kinetic models describing a gas of interacting atoms and photons @xcite , fracture propagation phenomena @xcite , and construct financial models @xcite . in the theoretical front , some studies on the canonical quantization of a classical system have also been investigated @xcite , as well as the @xmath10-theorem in relativistic and non - relativistic domain @xcite .    in the astrophysical domain",
    ", the first application has been the simulation in relativistic plasmas . in this regard",
    ", the power - law energy distribution provides a strong argument in favour of the kaniadakis statistics @xcite .",
    "additionally , the viability of non - gaussian statistics has been investigated from a stellar astrophysics viewpoint : the distributions of projected rotational velocity measurements of stars in the pleiades open cluster @xcite , in the main sequence field stars @xcite , * and in the estimation of the mean angle of inclination of the rotational axes of the stars in the orion nebula cloud @xcite * , as well as the strong dependence between the stellar - cluster ages and the power - law distributions @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is twofold .",
    "first , to show that the maxwell s first derivation of the stationary distribution function for a dilute gas can be extended in the context of kaniadakis statistics ; second , considering the principle of maximum entropy for a stellar self - gravitating system , to investigate an analytical relation between entropic parameter @xmath0 and stellar polytrope index @xmath1 . it is also show that the function @xmath2 has a similar behaviour to tsallis expression @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we show the correspondence between the @xmath0-statistics introduced by kaniadakis and the velocity distribution for a maxwellian gas , by assuming a non - gaussian generalization of the separability hyphothesis originally proposed by maxwell @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we discuss a connection between kaniadakis statistics and the polytropic index in the context of the self - gravitating system and we compare our results with ones studied in ref .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "in this section , in order to introduce the generalization of the maxwell distribution in the context of kaniadakis framework .",
    "let us consider a spatially homogeneous gas , assumed to be in equilibrium ( or in stationary state ) at temperature @xmath11 , in such a way that @xmath12 is the number of particles with velocity @xmath13 in the volume element @xmath14 around @xmath13 . in maxwell s derivation ,",
    "the 3-dimensional distribution is factorized and depends only on the magnitude of the velocity @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the standard maxwellian distribution function , given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normalization constant .    in reality , in the @xmath0-statistics context described by ( [ first ] ) , the starting basic hypothesis ( [ maxwellian ] ) , which takes into account the isotropy of all velocity directions , must somewhat be modified . from a statistical viewpoint ,",
    "maxwell s ansatz assumes that the three components of the velocity are * statistically independent*. however , this property does not hold in the systems endowed with long range interactions , or statistically dependent , where kaniadakis distribution has been observed @xcite .",
    "notice that the maxwell ansatz is equivalent to expressing @xmath20 as the sum of the logarithms of the one dimensional distribution functions associated with each velocity component .",
    "a simple and natural way to generalize this procedure within the kaniadakis framework , * would be to introduce statistical dependence between the velocity components * , e.g. , to replace * the usual product between @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 by a @xmath0-exponential of the sum of @xmath24 of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 . from a physical viewpoint",
    ", the statistical dependence allows introducing a distribution that has a better fit than the maxwellian in the statistical description of some physical systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite)-generalization of the maxwell ansatz ( see , e.g , ref @xcite)*]*. therefore , in order to recover the ordinary logarithmic ansatz as a particular limiting case , it is convenient to express the power generalization in terms of the function @xmath27 defined by eq .",
    "( [ expk1 ] ) , which is a combination of a power function plus appropriate constants .",
    "mathematically , the consistent @xmath0-generalization of ( [ maxwellian ] ) is given by @xmath28dv_xdv_ydv_z\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath0-exponential and @xmath0-logarithm are given by identities ( [ expk ] ) and ( [ expk1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath9 the standard expressionr ( [ maxwellian ] ) is recovered .",
    "note also that @xmath29=\\exp_\\kappa[\\ln_\\kappa(f)]=f$ ] , and @xmath30 are satisfied .",

    "( [ phichi ] ) depends only on @xmath31 , with @xmath40 .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ phieq ] ) can be satisfied only if all its members are equal to one and the same constant , not depending on any of the velocity components .",
    "thus we can make @xmath41 , obtaining @xmath42=-m\\gamma\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "+ * the solution of eq .",
    "( [ diferential ] ) is given by * @xmath44 which provides @xmath45 in order to calculate the complete distribution , we insert the expressions ( [ fvi0 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ kdistribution ] ) to obtain @xmath46^\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\;.\\ ] ]    * if we assume the function @xmath25 to be normalizable , we can write @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath0-normalization constant .",
    "*    in order to calculate the so - called @xmath0-normalization , let us introduce the expression @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath1 ( = 1,2,3 ) is the number of the degree of freedom . here , considering @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53 using the generalized gamma functions @xcite @xmath54}{[1-(r-1)|\\kappa|]^2-\\kappa^2}\\\\ & & \\times\\frac{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{|2\\kappa|}-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)}{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{|2\\kappa|}+\\frac{r}{2}\\right ) } \\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and after some algebra , we obtain @xmath55 } \\frac{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{|2\\kappa|}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{|2\\kappa|}+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}\\;.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the standard maxwellian result @xmath56 is recovered in the gaussian limit @xmath9 .    using the expression ( [ nk00 ] ) for @xmath57 , we can show that the normalization for the complete distribution is given by @xmath58 \\frac{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{|2\\kappa|}+\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{|2\\kappa|}-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}\\;,\\ ] ] as expected , the @xmath0-distribution above is isotropic meaning that all velocity directions are equivalent in this generalized context . here",
    ", we emphasize that in the limit @xmath59 both the normalization and the distribution function reproduce the standard maxwellian ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we shall discuss a connection between the kaniadakis statistics and polytropic index in the context of the self - gravitating system . following a procedure considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us start with the kaniadakis generalized entropy of index @xmath0 of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and the parameter @xmath62 provides a possible generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy .",
    "the extremum entropy state can be derived by varying @xmath63 with respect to @xmath64 . using the lagrange multipliers",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 , the extremum solution subject to constraints @xmath67 and @xmath68 is obtained from @xmath69 which leads to @xmath70-\\alpha \\\\   & & \\left.-\\beta \\left({v^2\\over 2 } + \\phi\\right)\\right\\}\\delta f d\\omega=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have used the relation @xmath71 for derivation of above expression . here , @xmath72 denotes gravitational potential , and the equation ( [ vars ] ) must be satisfied independently of the choice of @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following distribution function @xmath74^{1/\\kappa}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 are defined by @xmath77 @xmath78 * and @xmath79 . *    * in order to obtain a relation between the stellar polytrope index @xmath1 and entropic parameter @xmath0 , let us now introduce the polytropic sphere distribution @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the relative energy of a star , given by @xcite @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the relative potential of a star associated with @xmath72 . therefore ,",
    "comparing the distribution ( [ fk001 ] ) with ( [ eeee ] ) , we have * @xmath84    * let us now compare the expression @xmath2 with the tsallis relation @xmath3 .",
    "in this regard , plastino and plastino @xcite have introduced an expression given by * @xmath85 which includes the isothermal situation for @xmath86 , i.e. , the gaussian limit @xmath87 . in order to guarantee the conservation of mass and energy",
    ", the tsallis parameter @xmath88 should be larger than 9/7 .    in figure",
    "@xmath89 we display the dependence between the entropic indexes ( @xmath90 ) and the polytropic index ( @xmath1 ) , given by eqs .",
    "( [ nk ] ) and ( [ qindex ] ) , respectively .",
    "we show that the polytropic index diverges for the non - gaussian parameters @xmath91 , i.e. , the isothermal spheres separate the polytropes into two branches . for @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,",
    "@xmath1 ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 . from @xmath96 , we see that @xmath81 is a decreasing function of the energy and , when @xmath97 , the distribution function becomes a constant independent of energy . on the other hand , it is well known that , for any astrophysical system , @xmath1 should be positive and higher than @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "thus the intervals @xmath99 and @xmath100 represent forbidden regions , since the values of @xmath1 index tend to be smaller than @xmath98 and negative .",
    "it is also worth observing that @xmath101 and @xmath102 also provides @xmath103 .",
    "however this limits on @xmath90 violates the validity of @xmath0-statistics @xcite and the non - extensive @xmath10-theorem @xcite , respectively .",
    "as is well known , for the polytropic index @xmath104 , the density falls off so slowly at large radii that the mass is infinite @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows that only the branches on the right - side are physically significant for @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the physical values of the tsallis parameter @xmath88 should be larger than @xmath106 also was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ] , and the kaniadakis parameter @xmath0 should be constrained to interval of validity @xmath107 $ ] represented by the lower dashed rectangle .",
    "* it is also worth noting that the polytropic indices obtained from kaniadakis statistics are restricted to the range @xmath108 , which excludes important stellar polytopes of index @xmath109 , i.e. , the models of adiabatic stars supported by pressure of a non - relativistic gas @xcite . *    * summing up , a close examination of figure 1 tells us that the two distributions studied here present a similar behaviour for stellar polytropes , although kaniadakis function is more restrictive than tsallis . in reality , in order to know that framework is better , we should do a study based on observational data , e.g. , an investigation considering the comparison between stellar polytropes and navarro - frenk - white halo models for the description of dark matter halos ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this regard , an analysis considering this issue is currently under investigation . *",
    "in this work we have studied kaniadakis statistics based on the generalized maxwellian formulation for the @xmath0-statistics and , as an application , we investigate the physical effect on the stellar polytropic system . in the first part , we conclude that there is a kanidakis velocity distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ fkk ] ) that is uniquely determined by the requirements of ( i ) isotropy and ( ii ) a generalization of the factorizability condition . from the physical viewpoint , this generalization introduces statistical * dependence * between the velocity components , when we replace the logarithm function by a power law ( a similar argument was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite for the non - gaussian generalization of molecular chaos hypothesis ) .",
    "in particular , maxwell expressions are recovered in the gaussian limit , @xmath110 .    from an application perspective",
    ", we have shown that the expressions for tsallis and kaniadakis , given by eqs .",
    "( [ qindex ] ) and ( [ nk ] ) , present similar behaviours .",
    "however , the astrophysical limit on the polytropic index @xmath111 , provides the constraint @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath112 for the kaniadakis and tsallis parameters , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the gaussian limit @xmath9 , equivalent the tsallis expression eq .",
    "( [ qindex ] ) for @xmath87 , reproduces maxwellian isothermal spheres or , equivalently , @xmath113 .",
