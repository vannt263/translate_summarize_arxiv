    "it is found from discovery of the neutrino oscillation that the lepton - flavor symmetries are not exact in nature , while the charged lepton - flavor violation ( clfv ) has not been observed yet .",
    "the clfv is suppressed even if the tiny neutrino masses observed in the experiments are introduced in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the clfv processes are proportional to the fourth power of the neutrino masses due to the gim mechanism , similar to the quark sector .",
    "the predicted branching ratio of @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "however , the lepton - flavor symmetries are accidental in the sm , and it is a big mystery in particle physics why the clfv processes are not discovered , when considering beyond - standard models ( bsms ) @xcite .",
    "searches for clfv processes have long history .",
    "search for @xmath0 was performed soon after muons were discovered , and it was found that muons are not an excited state of electrons . on 60 s , the two - neutrino hypothesis , in which the lepton flavor conservations were introduced , was proposed to suppress @xmath0 .",
    "the tau - lepton flavor conservation has been also tested after tau lepton was discovered on 75. however , on 98 , the neutrino oscillation was discovered at superkamiokande experiments .",
    "now the bounds on the clfv processes are significantly improved by efforts of experimentalists .",
    "the current experimental bounds on the representative clfv processes of muon are given as follows , @xmath2 @xmath3-@xmath4 conversion rates in nuclei , given in eqs .",
    "[ mueti ] and [ mueau ] , are normalized by the muon capture rates .",
    "those for tau - lepton s processes come from the belle and babar experiments , and they are and [ taulfve ] are combined results of belle @xcite and babar @xcite . ] @xmath5 a new experiment for @xmath6 search , meg , has been started at psi this year @xcite .",
    "it is argued @xcite that a successful physics run for 5 - 6 months reaches to @xmath7-@xmath8 , which is improvement of more than 10 compared with the current bound derived by the mega experiment on 98 @xcite , and that a goal of the first phase of the experiment is @xmath9-@xmath10 after another two years .",
    "further improvement down to @xmath11 in the second phase may be possible after some upgrades .",
    "the signal in @xmath3-@xmath4 conversion experiments is monochromatic electron with energy @xmath12 ( @xmath13 bounding energy ) , and then the backgrounds ( bgs ) are quite suppressed . while the conversion rates are suppressed by @xmath14 compared with @xmath15 in typical bsms such as supersymmetric models ,",
    "the high sensitivities to the bsms are expected .",
    "two experiments for @xmath3-@xmath4 conversion searches with sensitivities @xmath16 , mu2e in fermilab @xcite and comet in j - parc @xcite , are planed .",
    "furthermore , the prism / prime experiment , in which very intensive pulsed beam is produced by the ffag muon storage ring , is also planed .",
    "it has ultimate sensitivity as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the searches for clfv in the tau decay will be continued by the belle experiment ; however , further improvement requires higher luminosity @xmath18 .",
    "now , two experiments , the super kekb @xcite and the super flavor factory @xcite , are planed .",
    "the processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 already suffer from irreducible bgs from @xmath21 , improvements of the sensitivities are scaled as @xmath22 without reduction of the bgs , and the reaches are argued @xmath23 .",
    "other clfv processes in the tau decay are almost bg - free , and the reaches are argued @xmath24 .",
    "following are effective operators with clfv of muon up to @xmath25 , @xmath26 the first term is for @xmath0 , and the second and third ones are for @xmath27 and @xmath3-@xmath4 conversion in nuclei , respectively . here , other lfv terms with different tensor structures are omitted for simplicity .",
    "roughly speaking , the branching ratios or conversion rates are @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 and @xmath31 should be larger than @xmath32  gev from the experimental bounds .",
    "this implies that the clfv searches have quite sensitivities to the bsms .",
    "we have several motivations to consider the bsms at tev scale .",
    "the naturalness argument for the higgs boson mass terms is one of them .",
    "the dark matter in the universe may be related to physics at tev scale .",
    "in addition , some people consider origin of the neutrino masses at tev scale .    why does nature hide clues of the bsms from fcnc processes including clfv processes",
    "? some of bsms , such as the two- or multi - higgs doublet models and the left - right symmetric models , introduce new higgs and/or gauge bosons at tev scale .",
    "some models , such as supersymmetric models , extra dimension models , and the little higgs model with t parity , introduce partners of leptons and quarks .",
    "those new fields introduce new sources of fcncs .",
    "while fcncs in the sm are suppressed by small quark / lepton masses or small mixing angle due to the gim mechanism , the suppression is not necessarily automatic in the bsms .",
    "first , let us consider the clfv processes in the supersymmetric standard model ( susy sm ) , since it is the leading candidate among the bsms and also a prototype of the bsms .",
    "supersymmetry is a symmetry between bosons and fermions , and superpartners for each particles in the sm are introduced to the susy sm .",
    "supersymmetry is not exact in nature .",
    "we need to introduce susy - breaking mass terms for susy particles , which have not yet been discovered .",
    "the susy - breaking terms are new sources of the flavor violation , since the squark and slepton mass matrices are not necessarily simultaneously diagonalized with those of quarks and leptons .",
    "this leads to so - called the susy flavor problem .",
    "we will discuss this problem from a viewpoint of clfv in the following .    in the susy",
    "sm @xmath6 is generated by one - loop diagrams , and the branching ratio is approximately given as @xmath33 where @xmath34 the susy breaking scale , @xmath35 the slepton mixing angle , @xmath36 is the slepton mass square difference .    while the branching ratio of @xmath0 is suppressed by one - loop factor , we need much more suppression in order to make it below the experimental bound .",
    "three directions are proposed .",
    "first is the universal scalar mass hypothesis , in which the squarks and sleptons with common quantum numbers are degenerate in mass ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "many models are constructed following this direction ; the gravity mediation @xcite , the gauge mediation @xcite , the gaugino mediation @xcite , and the anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "second is the alignment hypothesis ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is assumed that squark and slepton mass matrices can be diagonalized in the same basis as those of quarks and leptons due to some flavor symmetries or some mechanism @xcite .",
    "third is the decoupling hypothesis ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "squarks and sleptons in the first and second generations are so heavy ( @xmath40  gev ) that the flavor violation in the first and second generations are suppressed @xcite .    in these three hypothesis , the clfv processes are suppressed . however , the improvements of the experimental sensitivities may probe the origin of the susy breaking terms and also physics beyond the susy sm .    in the universal scalar mass hypothesis , if some physics has lfv interactions below the susy - breaking mediation scale , the lfv slepton mass terms are induced radiatively by the renormalization - group effect @xcite . in this case",
    "the lfv mass terms are not suppressed by powers of the energy scale for the lfv interactions . the seesaw mechanism and",
    "the guts are nowadays ones of attractive models from the phenomenological and theoretical points of view . in these models ,",
    "lfv yukawa interactions are introduced .",
    "thus , if the susy breaking mediation scale is higher than the gut @xcite or the right - handed neutrino mass scale @xcite , sizable lfv processes might be predicted . in fig .",

    "in addition , even when susy particle masses larger than @xmath42-@xmath43  tev , the higgs boson exchange may give sizable contributions to the clfv processes @xcite .",
    "the susy sm has two doublet higgs bosons ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , and their effective couplings for leptons are @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the tree - level yukawa coupling and @xmath48 is non - holomorphic correction generated at one - loop level .",
