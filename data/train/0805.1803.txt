    "typical stellar systems , globular clusters and elliptical galaxies , possess dense cores which have to influence the dynamical properties of the systems . at the same time , the gravitating n - body systems as non - linear many dimensional systems , possess chaotic properties @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study the role of the core in the chaotic properties of the spherical collisionless gravitating systems .",
    "namely , the question is , whether the core is increasing or decreasing the relative chaos in the system . for comparison ,",
    "it is known , that a massive center is increasing the chaotic properties of the system @xcite with respect to a homogeneous spherical system .",
    "we use the ricci curvature criterion @xcite of relative instability and perform numerical simulations for static n - body configurations with given total energy , as a parameter characterizing the system .",
    "it is shown , that in contrast to the role of the central massive body , the core can increase , as well as , decrease the chaos in the system , depending on the ratio of the core and system s radii .",
    "the numerical experiments enable to obtain the corresponding critical value of the core .",
    "the ricci curvature criterion is defined as follows . among two systems ,",
    "the system with smaller negative values of the ricci curvature in a certain interval @xmath0 $ ] of the affine parameter @xcite @xmath1 is unstable with higher probability . the curvature @xmath2 is defined by the ricci tensor @xmath3 and then is averaged over the directions of the deviation of the close geodesics ; @xmath4 is the velocity on the geodesics , for details see @xcite .    for n - body systems when the direct impacts of two particles are neglected , which is a fair approximation for real stellar systems",
    ", @xmath5 has the form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 with the derivatives @xmath8 when @xmath9 @xmath10,\\ ] ] when @xmath11 @xmath12}.\\ ] ] thus , eq.(1 ) defines a measure of relative instability between several systems .",
    "the created software was generating spherical 3d systems of point particles with random distribution of velocities and coordinates .",
    "equal mass particle systems were considered only , typically with negative total energy i.e. @xmath13 or @xmath14 . for given @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the kinetic energy is normalized to    @xmath18    a sample of @xmath19 stars is then selected , to generate a subsystem ( core ) , by means of multiplication of the coordinates of its particles by a factor @xmath16 ; cf .",
    "e.g. with the estimations of ricci curvature in @xcite . to enable the comparison of the sequence of the modified systems with different sizes and masses of the core , the total energy is initially normalized by means of the variation of the total kinetic energy .",
    "this is reached by multiplication of the velocities of all stars by a factor @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the kinetic energy values before and after the normalization , respectively .",
    "this procedure was repeated for different values of n , starting from @xmath23 up to @xmath24 .",
    "the studied systems revealed similar behavior : they are more unstable at @xmath16 close to both @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and for @xmath27 , but not for @xmath28 .",
    "the typical behavior of @xmath29 vs @xmath16 has an extremum , while the dependence on @xmath17 has a plateau for @xmath28 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the ricci curvature is a local , in time , measure of relative instability , i.e. concerns two or more systems immediately after an initial time moment .",
    "the numerical experiments enabled us to study the systems with core radius parameter @xmath16 from @xmath30 to @xmath26 , and mass parameter @xmath17 from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , and total energy parameter @xmath15 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "note , the first two parameters are not mutually independent .",
    "the typical behavior of the ricci curvature shows that the core is able both , to increase and decrease the instability of the system , however , its representation via the core parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 is not equivalent .",
    "namely , when the ricci curvature is decreasing both at smaller and larger core radii , with maximum value reached at certain critical @xmath33 , the dependence on @xmath17 is increasing monotonically upon the increase of the latter up to 1",
