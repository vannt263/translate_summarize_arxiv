    "[ sec - intro ]    a lorentz gas ( lg ) is the billiard  system  in the complement of a union of disjoint bounded , regular , convex sets of the plane .",
    "namely , a dimensionless particle moves with constant unit velocity until it hits one of the sets ( henceforth ` scatterers ' ) , at which point it undergoes an instantaneous fesnel reflection , i.e. , the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence .",
    "this dynamical system  generalizes on the one hand the so - called ` sinai billiard ' , in which the particle is confined to a bounded domain , and on the other hand the _ periodic _ lorentz gas , in which the scatterer  configuration is invariant for the action of a co - compact lattice in @xmath0 .",
    "the most important feature that comes with a lg being an extended systemis that its physically relevant measure , the liouville measure , is infinite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the most fundamental ergodic  property of an infinite - measure  system : poincar recurrence .",
    "this property is far from trivial , in general @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", it took the community considerable effort and more than a decade to prove recurrence for periodic lgs with finite horizon ( i.e. , such that the free path between two collisions is bounded from above ) .",
    "this was achieved by schmidt @xcite and conze @xcite at the end of the 1990 s .",
    "recurrence has earned further importance lately , as it was proved @xcite that it is a sufficient condition for ergodicity .",
    "( see section [ sec - defs ] for the definition of ergodicity in infinite measureand for the general geometric assumptions that are needed for this and all the forthcoming results . )",
    "it is well known that , for _ dispersing _ billiards such as ours , ergodicity implies much stronger chaotic properties  in our case , for suitable finite - measure  poincar maps .",
    "( good surveys of old and recent results in this celebrated field are found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the motivation behind the present work is the idea that `` most '' finite - horizon lorentz gases must be recurrent .",
    "after all , if the most orderly scatterer  configurations , the periodic ones , give rise to diffusive and thus recurrent dynamical systems , one imagines that the same must happen for the `` typical '' configuration .",
    "this conviction is corroborated by the results of @xcite .",
    "for instance , a lg can be non - recurrent only if it is totally transient , i.e. , almost all trajectories escape to infinity .",
    "also , a compactly supported perturbation of a recurrent lg is recurrent as well . as a matter of fact",
    ", no example has been constructed yet of a transient lg .    in order to formalize the intuition above into a precise conjecture",
    ", we present a very natural space of lgs , an _ ensemble _ , in the sense that it comes endowed with a probability measure . given a lattice with compact fundamental domain , we partition the plane into copies of this domain ( henceforth ` cells ' ) . in each cell",
    "we place a random configuration of scatterers so that the configurations in two distinct cells are independent and identically distributed .",
    "we call this ensemble @xmath1 .",
    "the conjecture then reads : almost all gases in @xmath1 are recurrent .",
    "we are not able to prove the conjecture as of now , but can give a list of results that will hopefully put it within closer reach ( and anyway make it all the more credible ) .",
    "for instance , the set @xmath2 of recurrent lgs is topologically typical in @xmath1 , provided one metrizes the latter in a reasonable way ( cf .",
    "section [ sec - model ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 has either full or zero measure(section [ sec - meas ] ) .",
    "this last result is particularly valuable as it generalizes to all dimensions .",
    "we also construct a finite - measure  dynamical system  whose dynamics comprises that of all s in all configurations of @xmath1 .",
    "the almost sure recurrence in @xmath1 is equivalent to the _ cocycle _ recurrence of a certain function  over this system , and we give a sufficient condition for that ( section [ sec - finite ] ) . verifying the condition on our model , however , seems rather complicated , so we study how this dynamical system  behaves for a few simple models ( section [ sec - toy ] ) .    from a technical viewpoint , the paper builds on the results of @xcite .",
