    "the aim of this paper is to propose and study a fully discrete higher - order variant of the minimizing movement scheme in one space dimension for the nonlinear diffusion equation @xmath1 with negative exponent @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-dimensional torus .",

    "t}}^d}u^\\alpha dx$ ] with respect to the wasserstein distance .",
    "the gradient flow formulation gives rise to a natural semi - discretization in time of the evolution by means of the minimizing movement scheme , leading to a minimization problem for the sum of kinetic and potential energies .",
    "minimizing movement schemes for evolution equations with an underlying gradient flow structure were first suggested by de giorgi @xcite in an abstract framework .",
    "jordan , kinderlehrer , and otto @xcite have shown that the solution to the linear fokker - planck equation can be obtained by minimizing the logarithmic entropy in the wasserstein space . since then , many nonlinear evolution equations have been shown to constitute wasserstein gradient flows , for instance the porous - medium equation @xcite , the keller - segel model @xcite , equations for interacting gases @xcite , and a nonlinear fourth - order equation for quantum fluids @xcite .    the minimizing movement scheme can be interpreted as an implicit euler semi - discretization with respect to the wasserstein gradient flow structure . while for some time this has been mainly used as an analytical tool , more recently numerical approximations of evolution equations using this scheme have been proposed . in one space dimension ,",
    "the optimal transport metric becomes flat when re - parametrized by means of inverse cumulative functions , which simplifies the numerical solution ; see e.g.  @xcite . for multi - dimensional situations ,",
    "one approach is based on the eulerian representation of the discrete solution on a fixed grid .",
    "the resulting problem can be solved by using interior point methods @xcite , finite elements @xcite , or finite volumes @xcite .",
    "another approach employs the lagrangian representation , which is well adapted to optimal transport .",
    "examples are explicit marching schemes @xcite , moving meshes @xcite , linear finite elements for a fourth - order equation @xcite , reformulations in terms of evolving diffeomorphisms @xcite , and entropic smoothing using the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite .",
    "the connection between lagrangian schemes and the gradient flow structure was investigated in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use the lagrangian viewpoint .",
    "the minimizing movement scheme of de giorgi is of first order in time only since it is based on the implicit euler method . concerning higher - order schemes",
    ", we are only aware of the paper @xcite . there , second - order gradient flow schemes were suggested for the euler equations , with finite differences in space and the two - step bdf ( backward differentiation formula ) method or diagonally implicit runge - kutta ( dirk ) schemes in time .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a fully discrete second - order minimizing movement scheme using quadratic finite elements in space and the two - step bdf method in time .",
    "we consider periodic point - symmetric solutions .",
    "the finite - dimensional minimization problem , constrained by the mass conservation , is solved by the method of lagrange multipliers which leads to a sequential quadratic programming problem .    by construction ,",
    "our numerical scheme is of second order both in time and space , it conserves the mass and dissipates the @xmath0-norm of the approximation @xmath6 of the quadratic ansatz functions at time step @xmath7 , @xmath8 where the matrix @xmath9 is defined in the approximation of the wasserstein metric on the space of the quadratic ansatz functions .",
    "we refer to section  [ sec.disc ] for details .",
    "it turns out that numerically , the relative @xmath0-norm decays exponentially fast to zero .",
    "although we can not expect for the multistep scheme that the discrete entropy decays exponentially fast , this holds true for the numerical experiments performed in this paper .",
    "furthermore , also the discrete variance of the original variable @xmath10 and the lagrangian variable decay exponentially fast .",
    "the numerical tests also indicate that the decay rate of the entropy is increasing in the number of grid points , i.e. , the discrete decay rates are smaller than the ( expected ) value for the continuous equation .",
    "this result is in accordance with the findings of @xcite for a finite - volume approximation of a one - dimensional linear fokker - planck equation .",
    "let us briefly review the literature for the diffusion equation with @xmath2 .",
    "equation   with @xmath11 appears in the modeling of heat conduction in solid helium , where the solution @xmath10 corresponds to the inverse temperature @xcite .",
    "when this equation is considered in the whole space or in a bounded domain with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions , it is sometimes called the super - fast diffusion equation ( * ? ? ?",
    ". the critical exponent of this equation in one space dimension is @xmath11 . for @xmath12 and @xmath13",

    "the appendix contains the proofs of the existence and large - time asymptotics theorems and the calculations of the coefficients of the matrix @xmath9 and the hessian of the discrete entropy .",
    "equation on the torus @xmath3 does not possess the non - existence or instantaneous extinction properties of the super - fast diffusion equation in the whole space since mass can not get lost . in fact , we expect that for any @xmath2 , there exists a global weak solution . if the initial datum @xmath27 is nonnegative only , is still a singular diffusion equation .",
