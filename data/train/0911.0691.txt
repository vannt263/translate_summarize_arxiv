    "during the last two years we have monitored v393 sco with several high resolution spectrographs ( e.g. coralie , uves , feros , crires ) covering several orbital cycles and a couple of long cycles . we have also used the published asas v - band light curve and a special code ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "spectral lines of the donor are clearly visible and follow the orbital motion without interference during the long cycle , but the gainer ( primary ) is apparently ( at least partially ) hidden by a circumprimary disc and hei absorption lines follow peculiar motions during orbital / long cycles ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 double emission indicates an outer optically thin part of the circumprimary disc . a feros spectrum obtained at orbital phase 0.00 and long phase 0.94 shows h@xmath0 emission much stronger than a uves spectrum taken at orbital phase 0.97 and long phase 0.57 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this implies that the h@xmath0 emission ( eventually the disc ) is larger on the long cycle maximum .",
    "the central absorption deeper than the continuum at this epoch suggests that the disc is eclipsed by the donor .",
    "if we interpret the hei absorption lines as produced in a deeper , optically thicker disc region , their rvs indicate strong changes in the structure of this region during the long cycle .",
    "the presence of strong line absorption wings at specific phases at the hei 1083.3 nm line indicates mass exchange / loss in the system .",
    "the strong modulation of the fwhm for the hei5875 line during long cycle could reflect a rotational instability of the circumprimary disc ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is difficult to estimate the mass ratio , since the helium lines , that could be indicators of the primary motion , do not show a consistent value for @xmath8 .",
    "however , the best fit to the light curve of v393 sco always requires the presence of a circumprimary disc under reasonable assumptions . using @xmath9= 0.25 and @xmath9= 0.41 as trials",
