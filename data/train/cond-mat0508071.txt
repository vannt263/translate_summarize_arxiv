    "mesoscopic systems connected to superconducting leads have been investigated for a number of years .",
    "if the mesoscopic system itself is superconducting the transport is influenced by the so - called parity effect in the coulomb blockade regime.@xcite for normal metal grains , the effect of the superconductivity is merely to modify the tunneling density of states due to the density of the superconducting leads , thus introducing an additional gap in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "naturally , the josephson current is also affected by the coulomb correlations , because the transfer of a cooper pair charges the mesoscopic system by two electron charges .",
    "this process is similar to a cotunneling event , and in the limit of large coulomb repulsion , the path that involves double occupancy of the central region is not allowed , which results in a suppression of the josephson coupling .",
    "this has been studied extensively in a number of theoretical works , starting with the work of shiba and soda@xcite and glazman and matveev,@xcite who calculated the josephson current in the limit of infinite coulomb repulsion and in perturbation theory , the leading order being the fourth order in the tunneling amplitudes .",
    "interestingly , the josephson current was shown to change its sign when the level which supports the tunneling current becomes occupied .",
    "this so - called @xmath0 junction behavior , which is consequently also relevant in the kondo regime , has been studied in a number of papers.@xcite for larger dots the interplay of the above mentioned parity effect and the josephson effect has also been addressed.@xcite    experimentally , there has been a number of studies of metallic wires connected to superconductors,@xcite but only a few studies in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "et al._@xcite have observed multiple andreev reflections and kondo physics in carbon nanotube quantum dots .",
    "the supercurrent was not directly observed .    in this paper , we study the josephson coupling through a single level system coupled to vibrational or dissipative environments .",
    "this is relevant for molecular transistor systems where strong influence of the coupling to various vibrational modes have been observed.@xcite in the case of normal metal leads this has lead to a number of related theoretical works.@xcite however , so far the combination of the vibrational coupling and correlation transport has not been studied in the context of supercurrent .",
    "being a groundstate property the dissipative environment is expected to have a more dramatic effect on the supercurrent as compared to usual electron tunneling .",
    "this is indeed what we find in the case of strong coupling , where the franck - condon factors strongly suppress the supercurrent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "our model hamiltonian is presented and a convenient unitary transformation is performed . in sec .",
    "iii , the basic formula for the josephson current is derived to the fourth order in the tunneling amplitudes , and the different ingredients in this formula are discussed .",

    "we assume that the single - particle energy level @xmath14 can be experimentally tuned by the gate , i.e. , @xmath15 , and present the results for the critical josephson current as functions of @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath16 is the hamiltonian for the vibrational degrees of freedom @xmath17 and , finally , @xmath18 describes the coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "this coupling is solely through the charge on the central system , i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 in this model we neglect any modification of the tunneling due to the vibrations ( this is very often the relevant situation and the model could easily be generalized to incorporate such a dependence ) , and the tunneling hamiltonian is therefore given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23    in the next section we will calculate the josephson coupling using perturbation theory in the tunneling . for this purpose , it is convenient first to use a polaron representation , which transforms the coupling term @xmath18 to a displacement operator in the tunneling term.@xcite    the unitary transformation @xmath24 where @xmath25 removes the coupling term @xmath18 from the hamiltonian at the expense that the tunneling term acquires an oscillator displacement operator , so that eq .   becomes @xmath26 furthermore , the transformation renormalizes the on - site energy and the coulomb interaction according to @xmath27 in the following we will skip the tildes and use just @xmath28 again but we mean the renormalized quantities . using this transformed hamiltonian , we calculate the josephson current to the lowest order in the tunneling hamiltonian in the following sections .",

    "in fact , from now on we will assume that the two tunneling densities of states are energy independent .",
    "the value of @xmath61 may come out negative and we will see in the following that it really does so due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the case with @xmath63 is called a @xmath0 junction .",
    "this terminology originates from an equivalent description of the josephson junction in terms of total energy ( or free energy at nonzero temperature ) of the junction as a function of the phase difference @xmath64 . since @xmath65 the",
    "total energy reads @xmath66 and reaches minimum at @xmath67 for @xmath68 or @xmath69 for @xmath63 , respectively ( i.e. , the ground state of the junction corresponds to equal / opposite phases in the two leads ) .",
    "the @xmath0 junction behavior has been noted in a number of papers .",
    "@xcite the origin of this sign change is the blocking of channels for the cooper pair exchange when @xmath70 is large .",
    "see ref .   for a detailed account .",
    "ideally the josephson current can be measured in a current - bias setup where there is no voltage drop across the junction until the critical current is reached .",
    "however , in practice current - bias is difficult to achieve for large resistance junctions such as these single - electron devices and instead a voltage is swept across the junction and the critical current must be determined as half of the area of the ( ideally @xmath71-function - like ) peak in the @xmath72curve around @xmath73 , which then , of course , only yields the absolute value of @xmath61 .",
    "since the central region has interactions , we can not use wick s theorem , and we must evaluate the function @xmath49 using the many - body states , of which there are four : @xmath74 and @xmath75 in eq .",

    "we consider mainly the situation where the dispersion relation corresponds to the so - called ohmic case , equivalent to a frequency independent damping coefficient or , equally , spectral function @xmath91 linear in frequency .",
