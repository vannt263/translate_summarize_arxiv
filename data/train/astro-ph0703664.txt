    "the most effective method for finding high - redshift radio galaxies is by selecting for ultra steep - spectrum radio sources ( uss , @xmath13 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "a possible explanation of this empirical method is a @xmath2correction induced by a curvature of the radio spectra .",
    "high redshift sources with concave radio spectra will have steeper spectral indices compared to those at low redshift @xcite . comparing the extremely steep spectral index sources associated with galaxies residing closest to the cluster centres , @xcite found an explanation that suggests that the steeper spectra can also be explained by pressure - confined radio lobes which have slow adiabatic expansion losses in high density environments .",
    "high - redshift radio galaxies are extremely luminous , and spatially extended , compared to normal galaxies at similar redshifts .",

    "there is increasing new evidence that distant radio galaxies represent massive forming systems .",

    "we also present optical spectroscopy of sources selected from the @xcite and wish uss samples , yielding 12 new redshifts , including four new radio galaxies at @xmath12@xmath233 these provide excellent targets for follow - up observations in this interesting redshift range .",

    "we assume a standard @xmath24cdm model universe with cosmological parameters , @xmath25=0.3 , @xmath26=0.7 and a hubble constant of @xmath27100 km  s@xmath28mpc@xmath28 .",
    "the uss sample was selected from the 352 mhz westerbork in the southern hemisphere catalogue @xcite .",
    "we used a selection criterion based on the radio properties of the sources , steep radio spectral index ( @xmath29 ) and small angular size ( @xmath30 , as measured on the vla maps ) .",
    "all of the first and most of the second priority targets have been observed .",
    "a detailed description of the radio observations and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "most of the targets selected for optical spectroscopy are selected from the uss samples of @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain high resolution radio maps and accurate positions , we used the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory in the hybrid bna - configuration at 1.4ghz .",
    "the images were obtained on 1999 october 16 and 20 and consisted of l - band short subscans of 3 minutes each .",
    "we used the standard data reduction recipes in the astronomical image processing software ( aips@xmath31 ) package , including self - calibration for phase corrections .",
    "the uss fields were observed during two runs in 2000 march and 2001 january using the ohio state infrared imager / spectrometer ( osiris ) imager on the 4@xmath32meter v.m .",
    "blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "osiris is a 0.92.4 @xmath33 m camera with a 1024x1024 hawaii hgcdte ccd array .",
    "we used a focal ratio of f/7 which resulted in a respective pixel size of 0161 .",
    "individual frames were obtained as a co - addition of a number of single exposures with different integration times , in this way one effectively removes row / column related defects . for example , for sources with total exposures times of 1920s , we use 12 single exposures of 10s observed with a a 16@xmath32point dithering pattern .",
    "this results in @xmath34 minutes on source .",
    "we used similar procedure for the other images , doing small changes in the number of points of the dithering pattern and the exposure times for single observations during the observations , tip - tilt mirror corrections were made .",
    "this resulted in typical fwhms on the individual pointing frames ( @xmath35 co - added ) of @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the mean was around @xmath38 for the nights 2000 march 20 to 22 , and around @xmath37 on the 2001 january run .",

    "* ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) at paranal , ( chile ) between 2002 april and september . a @xmath40 filter ( 2.0 - 2.3 @xmath41 ) was used.the pixel scale was 0148 per pixel .",
    "all the images were obtained under optimum seeing conditions with fwhm in the range 07 and 10 , and a number of standard stars were observed during the same nights . in table 1 we present the log of the near - ir observations , with the observation dates , telescope / instrument used and the total exposure times for all the uss sample .",
    "data were reduced within iraf , using the standard dimsum @xcite near - ir reduction package , including dark subtraction , flat fielding , sky - substraction , bad pixel masking , bright object masking , registration and summing .",

    "the astrometric calibration of the images was performed using the wcstools package @xcite , using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue of point sources a reference catalog @xcite and the usno - a2.0 catalogue @xcite for fields with a few number of 2mass sources .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the relative astrometry to be @xmath1004 - 06 .",
    "the photometry for the ctio observations was calibrated using 2mass point sources detected in these fields . for vlt runs",
    ", magnitudes were calibrated using nicmos near - infrared standards @xcite .",
    "all standard star magnitudes were obtained using sextractor @xcite with an aperture diameter of @xmath42 , which proved to be adequate by monitoring the growth curve of all the measured stars . for the observations made with osiris and cirim at ctio the @xmath2band zero point was 22.64@xmath430.06 and 22.01@xmath430.02 ( for 1 count / second , integrated over the source ) , respectively . for the isaac / vlt observations we derive the zero - point based on observations of the near - ir photometric standard star s301-d taken from the list of @xcite .",
    "the zero - point obtained was 24.18@xmath430.01 .",
    "the zero - points do not include the airmass term , because the airmass dependence in @xmath2band is small and we have observed all our objects with airmasses @xmath44 , with a mean of 1.06 .",
    "because of the large uncertainties in the photometry , we did not correct the @xmath2band magnitudes for galactic extinction .",
    "we have used the ned database , which are based on the @xmath45 values from the extinction maps of @xcite .",
    "we found that most of the sources have values from 0.01 to 0.1 , which are negligible compared to magnitude errors .",
    "we have identified the near - ir counterparts to the radio sources by overlaying the radio contour maps on to the @xmath2band images using the aips@xmath31  task kntr .",
    "we measured the magnitudes of these identifications using sextractor .",
    "the parameters were set such that , to be detected , an object must have a flux in excess of 1 - 1.5 times the local background noise level over at least @xmath46 connected pixels , according to the seeing conditions and image qualities . in order to improve the detections of faint sources , we smoothed the @xmath2band images using a circular gaussian of fwhm=1 - 2 pixels . in some cases",
    ", we find that it is possible that the identification does not fall at the midpoint of the radio lobes , for radio sources with double or multiple components .",
    "we measured magnitudes for all radio source identifications using sextractor and circular apertures with diameters of 20 , 40 and 80 .",
    "we also obtained mag_best magnitudes in order to facilitate comparison with the literature @xcite . this is usually equal to mag_auto , but if the contribution of other source exceeds 10% , it is mag_isocor .",
    "the uncertainties quoted represent our best estimates , which includes the zero - point uncertainty ( see table 2 ) .",
    "table 2 lists our uss sample , the columns are : iau j2000 designation , spectral index obtained between 352 mhz and 1.4 ghz , largest angular size , as measured from radio maps taken with the vla , aperture magnitudes in 20 , 40 and 80 , sextractor mag_best magnitudes , j2000 position coordinates of the radio source and the @xmath2band identification counterpart , the half - light radius and class_star values of the @xmath2band identifications .",
    "sextractor class_star parameter provides an indication of the likelihood of an object being a galaxy or a star . in the ideal cases a galaxy has class_star@xmath47 and a point source has class_star@xmath48 .",
    "we find that all the uss sample analyzed in this work are consistent with extended sources ( galaxies ) rather than point sources ( stars or quasars ) .",
    "we also considered studying the environments of these uss radio galaxy candidates .",
    "the environments of twenty uss sources observed with ctio / osiris were analyzed in @xcite . in those images ,",
    "only 7 radio galaxies were identified , finding a statistically significant signal of clustering . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar analysis was performed on a wider field and with deeper data , finding a stronger result .",
    "we therefore do not analyze the environments of the uss sources in the relatively shallow @xmath6band images from this paper .",
    "during the past 6 years , we have obtained optical spectroscopy of 14 uss sources .",
    "the targets were mostly selected from 4 different uss samples : the 3 sub - samples of de breuck et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the wish ",
    "nvss sample described in this paper . from these samples , we mostly selected the final targets based on the ra range when telescope time was available .",
    "optical spectroscopy of a subsample of uss sources were carried with fors2 installed on the vlt unit telescope 4 yepun between 2000 october and 2001 may .",
    "we used a similar data reduction strategy to @xcite .",
    "we removed cosmic rays using the iraf task szap , after bias and flatfield correction .",
    "we used the iraf task background in order to remove sky variations and we extracted the spectra using a width appropriate to contain all flux in the extended emission lines .",
    "finally we calibrated the one dimensional spectra in wavelength and flux .",
    "we used the procedures described in @xcite and in @xcite to determine the central wavelength , total line flux , deconvolved widths , and rest - frame equivalent widths ( with their related errors ) of all the emission and absorption lines detected in our spectra . for each object , we quote a single redshift , which is an average of all the lines , weighted by the uncertainties due to the line fitting and wavelength calibration . in table 4",
    "we show the measured parameters of the emission / absorption lines in the spectra .",
    "longslit observations were made on ut 2004 january 19 - 20 , using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on keck i , with a slit width of 15 , under photometric conditions and 08 seeing .",
    "the spectroscopic setup is described in table 3 .",
    "data reduction was performed in iraf ; data were bias - subtracted , response - corrected , cosmic - ray - zapped using pieter van dokkum s lacosmic routine , sky - subtracted , and spectra extracted in a 15 aperture .",
    "the resultant 1-d spectra were wavelength and flux calibrated using appropriate arcs and standard stars .",
    "on ut 2006 december 14 and 15 , we obtained 3 spectra using the isis double beam spectrograph @xcite at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at observatorio roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma .",
    "conditions were photometric with 05 and 15 seeing during the first and second night , respectively .",
    "we used a dichroic splitting the light at 5300    and a 15 wide slit .",
    "the grisms used were the r300b in the blue arm and the r316r in the red arm .",
    "none of the 3 objects were detected in the blue arm . in the red arm , only wn  j0912@xmath321655 was clearly detected in 5400s of observing time .",
    "wn  j0604 - 2015 and wn  j0610 + 6611 were not detected in 5400s and 7200s , respectively .",
    "we extracted the red spectrum of wn  j0912@xmath321655 with an aperture width of 24 .",
    "we have determined redshifts of 12 out of 14 targets observed .",
    "the two targets without redshifts were undetected in 1.5 to 2 hours on a 4 m telescope , and need long integration on 810 m class telescopes .",
    "apart from tn  j2009@xmath323040 , which is a @xmath12=3.158 quasar , all 11 targets are radio galaxies with redshifts from @xmath12=0.550 to @xmath12=3.837 .",
