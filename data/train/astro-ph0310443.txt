    "while the actual transport mechanism and the nature of the primary sources have not been determined , it is often suggested that the origin of these heavy elements may be attributed to the first generation of stars , the so - called population  iii stars ( e.g. , ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; madau , ferrara , & rees 2001 ; thacker , scannapieco , & davis 2002 ; qian , sargent , & wasserburg 2002 ) .    in the standard cosmological models based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) ,",

    "1997 ; abel et al . 1998 ; yoshida et al .",
    "thus , the first heavy elements are likely to have been processed at such early epochs . intriguingly , the recent measurement of a large thomson optical depth by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ satellite ( kogut et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) provides evidence that the universe was reionized very early on , supporting the above notion that the first stars could form at @xmath7 ( e.g. , cen 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003a , b ; sokasian et al .",

    "the relative abundances of heavy elements produced in the first stars are of great importance because observations of the elemental abundance pattern of ultra metal - poor stars ( e.g. , christlieb et al .",
    "2002 ) can place strong constraints on the environments in which these stars were formed and possibly on the progenitor mass ( umeda & nomoto 2003 ; schneider et al .",
    "theoretical modeling of the formation of the first stars ( abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; omukai & palla 2003 ) consistently indicate that they were rather massive , with characteristic mass being possibly several hundred solar masses .",
    "if the first stars are indeed as massive as @xmath8 , they end their lives as energetic sne via the pair - instability mechanism ( e.g. , barkat , rakavy , & sack 1967 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; fryer , woosley , & heger 2001 ; heger & woosley 2002 ; woosley , heger , & weaver 2002 ) , releasing a total energy of up to @xmath1  ergs . such energetic explosions in the early universe",
    "are violently destructive : they expel the ambient gas out of the gravitational potential well of small - mass dark matter halos , causing an almost complete evacuation ( bromm , yoshida , & hernquist 2003 , hereafter paper  i ; wada & venkatesan 2003 ) .",
    "since the massive stars process a substantial fraction of their mass into heavy elements , early sn explosions may provide an efficient mechanism to pollute the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) . models of stellar evolution ( e.g. , heger & woosley 2002 ) predict that , in massive zero - metallicity stars , up to @xmath9% of the total stellar mass is processed into heavy elements in the core and , in the pair - instability case , _ all _ of it is finally ejected during the explosion without leaving any compact remnant behind .",
    "blast waves triggered by the sn explosions will then drive supersonic flows of gas that are enriched with the processed heavy elements .",
    "consequently , because of the short lifetimes of such massive stars , the emergence of the early generation stars should be almost immediately followed by metal enrichment of the igm ; i.e. , prompt metal enrichment could be achieved efficiently by population  iii sne in the early universe .",
    "the transport of metals by sn - driven winds has been studied extensively in the context of conventional galaxy formation ( e.g. , larson 1974 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; vader 1986 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ; aguirre et al .",

    "in fact , gas flows induced by sn explosions appear to be the most plausible way of distributing metals , which are observed to exist under a broad range of environments .",
    "interestingly , an array of observations indicate that the metals were produced and dispersed at early stages of structure formation .",
    "spectra of distant quasars consistently show that there are at least some metals in the diffuse igm at @xmath10 ( e.g. , schaye et al . 2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "qian & wasserburg ( 2001 , 2002 ) argue that the observed abundance patterns of metal - poor stars can be explained by the `` prompt - inventory '' of heavy elements from very massive stars .",
    "loewenstein ( 2001 ) points out that a contribution from very massive metal - free stars may account for the observed abundance anomalies of oxygen , silicon , and iron in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "more recently , freudling et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discovered a strong emission feature from a @xmath11 quasar , providing strong evidence that iron is produced in some stars / galaxies already at @xmath12 , which is expected if black hole growth is regulated by star formation ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "together with the implication of an early reionization derived from the _ wmap _ results , these observations indicate that population  iii stars may have been an important contributor of heavy elements in the diffuse igm / icm as well as the source of radiation responsible for the early reionization of the universe .",
    "the association of the igm metal enrichment with the uv - photon production from the first stars was previously discussed by oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and more recently by stiavelli , fall , & panagia ( 2003 ) . in these studies , however , the analysis was not based on a detailed modeling of the high - redshift star formation rate , and the precise epochs of population  iii pre - enrichment and reionization therefore remained somewhat uncertain . in the present paper , we revisit the cosmic metal production in the context of early structure formation .",
    "we explore the possibility that the first stars are responsible for reionization of the universe at @xmath13 , while also causing a significant , prompt chemical enrichment of the igm .",
    "we argue that , if the early reionization was the result of very massive population  iii stars , the mean metallicity should reach a critical level at which the efficiency of gas cooling is greatly enhanced , thus changing the overall mode of star formation ( e.g. , mackey , bromm , & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic transport of heavy elements induced by sn explosions is studied numerically in paper  i , using high - resolution , three - dimensional cosmological simulations .",
    "we show that a large amount of the gas is expelled out of the shallow gravitational potential of the host `` minihalos '' .",
    "the simulations in paper  i further demonstrate that , if the explosion kinetic energy is as high as @xmath1  ergs , nearly 90% of the pre - enriched gas in the immediate vicinity of the explosion site eventually escapes out of the host halo , reaching up to a distance of @xmath14  kpc in a few million years .",
    "since multiple sne are expected to be occurring at @xmath13 in distant star - forming regions within a cosmological volume , the total amount of metals produced _ and _ distributed into the igm may well exceed the critical level required to affect the thermal and chemical properties of the igm .",
    "the transition in stellar populations , from population  iii to population  ii , may then be naturally caused early on .    throughout the present paper , except in section [ rsi ] where we consider a variant cdm model",
    ", we work with a flat @xmath15-dominated cold dark matter universe with matter density @xmath16 , cosmological constant @xmath17 and the hubble constant at the present time @xmath18 in units of @xmath19 km s@xmath20mpc@xmath20 .",
    "we set the baryon density to @xmath21 and the initial density fluctuations are normalized to @xmath22",
    ". these parameters are consistent with those employed in the numerical simulations we refer to in the following sections .",
    "in this section we summarize various feedback effects from the first stars , and derive useful order - of - magnitude estimates for quantities needed to study these effects .",
    "the ultimate fate of a metal - free star depends critically on its mass .",
    "theoretical stellar models predict the following classification ( heger & woosley 2002 ; heger et al .",
    "2003 ) : ( 1 ) @xmath23 : these stars explode as core - collapse sne and leave a neutron star behind , ( 2 ) @xmath24 : these explode as faint type  ii sne and leave black holes behind after fall - back of most of the envelope ( see umeda & nomoto 2002 , 2003 ) , ( 3 ) @xmath25 : these do not explode as sne and directly collapse into black holes , ( 4 ) @xmath26 : these experience a pulsational instability and eject their outer envelope , again leaving a black hole behind , ( 5 ) @xmath27 : these explode as pair - instability sne , causing complete disruption , and ( 6 ) @xmath28 : these collapse , in the absense of rotation , directly into massive black holes .    in summary , only the pair - instability case can substantially contribute to the metal enrichment of the igm , whereas remnant black holes ( or neutron stars ) are left in the other cases , which we shall discuss in   2.5 . while early generation stars may be born with a broad range of masses ( e.g. , bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 , 2002 ; omukai & yoshii 2003 ) , very massive stars are dominant in causing various feedback effects to the igm in the early universe such as ionization , heating , and chemical enrichment .",
    "thus , throughout the present paper , we primarily consider very massive ( @xmath29 ) metal - free stars as population  iii stars .",
    "we first discuss radiative feedback .",
    "the efficiency of ionizing photon production from massive population  iii stars is obtained from detailed calculations ( e.g. , bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001b ; schaerer 2002 , 2003 ) . as our fiducial case",
    ", we consider a metal - free star with mass @xmath30 .",
    "such a star emits about @xmath31 ionizing photons per second , and has a main - sequence lifetime of @xmath32 million years .",
    "consider a population of such massive stars formed in a cubic comoving - mpc volume by @xmath33 .",
    "we introduce a quantity @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the cumulative number of ionizing photons emitted from the stars , and @xmath36 is the number of hydrogen atoms in the volume .",
    "this ` number of photons per atom ' @xmath37 serves as an indicator of the global ionization fraction as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "clearly , in order to completely ionize the igm , at least the same number of uv photons as the number of hydrogen atoms must be emitted within the volume .",
    "it follows from these numbers that more than a few hundred very massive stars must be formed in a comoving - mpc volume to cause complete reionization .",
    "massive metal - free stars are not only luminous ionizing sources , but also efficient factories of heavy elements . for stars with masses @xmath29 , typically up to @xmath38% of the mass is processed into heavy elements in the core , consisting mostly of carbon , oxygen , silicon and iron .",
    "we denote this mass fraction with @xmath39 , and set it to be 0.5 as our fiducial value for massive stars in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we further introduce a parameter @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total number of nuclei in the heavy elements processed in the core , and @xmath42 is the total number of ionizing photons emitted by the star during its lifetime .",
    "namely , with @xmath43 denoting the proton mass , @xmath44 is the total mass of metals produced in the star .",
    "this quantity gives the ratio of the stellar metal to photon production which is , in principle , uniquely determined by the structure and evolution of the respective star . for a metal - free star with mass @xmath45 that is destined to die in a pair - instability supernova ,",
    "the actual value is approximately @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the value for @xmath48 for less massive stars or for stars with finite metallicity from stellar evolution models .",
    "intriguingly , this parameter @xmath49 for the very massive stars that are destined to explode as pair - instability sne can be expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants as follows .",
    "we estimate the total number of ionizing photons produced during the lifetime of a population  iii star with mass @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "here , @xmath52 is the binding energy of an electron in an h atom , with @xmath53 being the bohr radius , @xmath54 the fine - structure constant , and @xmath55 the electron rest mass . assuming the limiting case of a 100% nuclear burning efficiency",
    ", we can write for the total number of nucleons processed into heavy elements : @xmath56 .",
    "we now have , for very massive stars that die as pair - instability sne , @xmath57 where @xmath58 describes the strength of the pion - nucleon interaction .",
    "the production of ionizing photons and metals in a massive star is thus determined by the ratio of the atomic and nuclear binding energies .",
    "the processed metals can be distributed into the igm only if some transport mechanism operates , otherwise the metals would be confined within a small region and the diffuse igm would be largely unaffected . in this section ,",
    "we first describe the hydrodynamics of a single population iii sn explosion in the early universe and then show that the gas and the heavy elements can be transported over a large distance .    assuming spherical symmetry of the system , we apply the usual sedov - taylor self - similar analysis for a given explosion energy and density of the ambient medium . we first need to specify the density profile of the surrounding igm in order to fully describe the evolution of the sn blast wave . for a density profile approximated by a simple power - law , @xmath59 , the expansion of a blast wave",
    "is described by the self - similar solution : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant determined by the energy integral , @xmath62 is the explosion energy , @xmath63 the particle number density of the surrounding medium , and @xmath64 the time elapsed since the explosion ( sedov 1959 ; see also ostriker & mckee 1988 ) . in reality , the gas density profile can be more complex because photo - evaporation due to radiation from the central star is very effective in small halos ( @xmath65 k ) .",
    "large pressure gradients in the ionized region drive an outward gas flow _ before _",
    "the explosion is triggered ( see paper  i ) .",
    "hence , although initially the gas density is high around the star , it is expected to be substantially reduced by the time when the star explodes , and the density profile will be much shallower except in the outer edge where a supersonic shockwave is propagating . taking the effective photo - evaporation into account , we assume the density of the ambient medium around the explosion site is approximately constant at the mean igm density at @xmath33 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the baryon density and @xmath68 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 .",
    "note that the shock radius in equation ( [ eq : sedov_p ] ) scales only weakly with the density and the explosion energy unless the density profile is very steep .",
    "the three - dimensional simulations in paper i show that the evolution of the shock radius is well described by equation ( [ eq : sedov_p ] ) in a piecewise manner for regions having density profiles with different slopes . for a constant density medium ,",
    "the sedov - taylor self - similar solution reduces to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the shock radius , @xmath71 the total sn energy in units of 10@xmath72 ergs , @xmath73 the particle number density of the ambient medium in units of 1 @xmath74 , and @xmath75 the elapsed time since the explosion in units of @xmath76 years .",
    "for the explosion energy , heger & woosley ( 2002 ) calculate the energy released by a population  iii pair - instability sn to be in the range @xmath77  ergs .",
    "the above solution is valid if the gas remains adiabatic , but breaks down when the shock becomes radiative .",
    "the hot gas in the interior of high redshift ( @xmath12 ) sn remnants ( snrs ) cools partly via inverse compton cooling .",
    "the characteristic cooling time for this process is given by @xmath78 note the strong dependence on redshift .",
    "at @xmath79 , the snr will remain approximately adiabatic ( hence equation [ [ eq : sedov ] ] is valid ) until @xmath80 years after the explosion .",
    "however , this provides only a _ maximum",
    "_ timescale . in the post - shock region ,",
    "the gas density and temperature are so high that hydrogen and helium atomic line cooling is the dominant cooling process .",
    "thus , a thin dense shell could be formed faster than the above timescale .",
    "the exact time when the post - shock region becomes radiative depends on the total explosion energy and the density of the ambient medium in a complicated manner .",
    "the shell forms when the local cooling time @xmath81 at radius @xmath82 becomes shorter than the expansion timescale @xmath83 .",
    "we use the analytic sedov - taylor solution for the temperature @xmath84 and density @xmath85 of the gas to compute the local gas cooling rate @xmath86 , assuming an explosion energy @xmath87 ergs and the gas density @xmath88 @xmath89 ( @xmath90 the mean igm density at @xmath91 ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations by whalen , abel , & norman ( 2003 ) indeed show that photo - evaporation by the central star reduces the final gas density within the host halo to very small values , comparable to the mean igm density . in this case , the shell forms at a time @xmath92  yr . then the shell radius ( the `` stalling - radius '' ) is @xmath93 kpc , and it expands only slowly during the later snow - plow stage as @xmath94 ( see figure 1 in paper i ) .",
    "this is perhaps an optimistic estimate because the gas evacuation efficiency by radiation from the stars depends on the host halo mass and the gas density profile .",
    "for a ten times higher density , @xmath95 @xmath89 , the stalling - radius is calculated to be only 40% smaller , @xmath96 kpc , which is more consistent with the result of our simulation presented in paper i. overall , because of the weak dependence of the self - similar solution ( equation [ [ eq : sedov ] ] ) on the density , the above estimates will not be significantly affected by ( possible ) variations in the gas density around the sn sites .",
    "the momentum - driven slow expansion is still important over a cosmological timescale ( bertschinger 1983 ) , with the radius doubling every twenty folds in time .",
    "thus , if mixing of the original ejecta with the ambient medium is efficient , the expelled metals can travel over a large distance ( @xmath90 a few kpc ) within a hubble time .",
    "three - dimensional numerical simulations of nakasato & shigeyama ( 2000 ) show that the sn ejecta are fairly well mixed within the remnant , with the enriched volume fraction being close to unity .",
    "wada & venkatesan ( 2003 ) show that metal - dispersal is very efficient even in dense , disk - shaped gas clouds .",
    "therefore , the processed metals are likely to be transported as far as the shell radius .",
    "let us calculate the evolution of the volume - averaged mean metallicity of the igm .",
    "we allow the uncertainty associated with the characteristic mass , or initial mass function ( imf ) , of population iii stars by assuming that a fraction , @xmath97 , of the population iii stars have masses in the pair - instability range .",
    "suppose that @xmath98 stars are formed by @xmath33 in a unit comoving volume .",
    "the total mass of metals produced within the volume is then @xmath99 we further normalize this quantity to the mass of the igm within the volume , to obtain the mean metallicity : @xmath100 recall that @xmath49 is approximately a constant for massive metal - free stars that explode as pair - instability sne ( equation [ [ eq : zeta ] ] ) , and @xmath37 traces the igm ionization fraction .",
    "the above equation simply shows that the total quantity of heavy elements ejected into the igm is proportional ( weighted by the fraction @xmath97 ) to the number of uv photons emitted by @xmath33 .",
    "we now consider the simplest case where _ all _ of the population iii stars have a mass of @xmath45 and explode as pair - instability sn , i.e. , @xmath97=1 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath101 marks the epoch of reionization ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "8 of sokasian et al .",
    "setting @xmath102 , we obtain @xmath103 which coincides with the critical metallicity necessary for the formation of low - mass gas clumps ( bromm et al . 2001a",
    "; see also mackey et al .",
    "note also that very massive stars become progressively unstable for increasing metallicity ( baraffe , heger , & woosley 2001 ) . therefore , for @xmath104 , the epoch when the transition in the mode of star formation occurs should closely match the _ first _ reionization epoch .",
    "note , however , that we have neglected recombination in the above argument .",
    "if population  iii star formation occurs rather gradually , taking a considerably longer time than a recombination time , most of the uv photons are simply consumed by recombination without increasing the global ionization fraction of the igm . approximating the igm density with the cosmic mean density",
    ", we estimate the recombination timescale for hydrogen : @xmath105 if the increase in the number of uv photons is sufficiently rapid , compared to @xmath106 , then the ionization fraction of the igm should monotonically increase .",
    "this is indeed the case for the model we describe below .",
    "an important question is _ when and how rapidly _ did the early generation stars emerge ?",
    "we address this issue using the formation rate of population iii stars derived by yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "their result is based on a semi - analytic model coupled with the outputs of a large cosmological @xmath107-body simulation . in their model ,",
    "star - forming regions are identified as halos in which the gas has been able to cool via molecular hydrogen cooling , and the usual ` one - star - per - halo ' assumption is made such that only a single star is formed per star - forming gas cloud .",
    "the model also includes the negative feedback owing to photo - dissociation of molecular hydrogen by photons in the lyman - werner band .",
    "hence , the model provides a conservative estimate for the early star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the resulting sfr was found to be in good agreement with that obtained from the hydrodynamic simulations of sokasian et al .",
    "( 2003a ) which include radiative transfer as well as various feedback processes .",
    "we revised the empirical fit to the sfr in yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and found that it is well - described by a particular form proposed by hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and , in this case , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 yr@xmath20 mpc@xmath116 .",
    "figure 1 shows the population iii sfr .",
    "the flattening at @xmath117 reflects the suppression of the gas cooling due to global radiative feedback , showing the self - regulating nature of early star formation ( e.g. , ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2002 ; wise & abel 2003 ; yoshida et al .",
    "we compare the derived sfr with the result of the hydrodynamic simulations of sokasian et al .",
    "( 2003a ) . to this end",
    ", we have averaged over all the nine models considered in sokasian et al .",
    "( 2003a ) which differ in the star - formation efficiency as well as the strengths of the feedback effects .",
    "overall , the agreement between the semi - analytic prediction and the simulation results is quite good . as sokasian et al .",
    "( 2003a ) note , the sfr derived from their simulations may suffer from finite boxsize effects at high redshifts ( @xmath118 ) , which accounts for the small discrepancy between the analytic model and the simulation result seen in figure 1 ( see also yoshida et al .",
    "2003b ; barkana & loeb 2003 )    in the middle panel of figure 1 , we plot the cumulative number of ionizing photons per baryon @xmath37 . we compute the number of ionizing photons assuming a single massive ( @xmath30 ) star emits ionizing photons at a rate of @xmath31 s@xmath20 during its main - sequence lifetime ( bromm et al .",
    "the dashed line in the middle panel indicates @xmath119 , which is achieved by @xmath120 .",
    "we note that the total number of uv photons increases by more than an order of magnitude between @xmath121 and @xmath120 .",
    "the corresponding time interval is @xmath38 myr , whereas the recombination timescale at @xmath91 is @xmath122 myr .",
    "therefore , to lowest order , the photon consumption due to hydrogen recombination can be neglected .",
    "in addition , since the photon escape fraction from minihalos is expected to be of order unity ( whalen et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the clumping of the igm at these early epochs is small ( haiman , abel & madau 1999 ) , @xmath123 a few should suffice to reionize a substantial fraction of the igm ( e.g. , sokasian et al .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in our model , the time when @xmath119 coincides with the epoch of reionization suggested by the _ wmap _ data , @xmath124 ( assuming an instantaneous reionization , see kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) . at the same time , as shown in the bottom panel in figure 1 , the global mean metallicity reaches the metallicity floor of a few @xmath125 .",
    "we emphasize that this _ global _ mean is merely an approximate estimate because , locally around the sn sites where the formation of second generation stars is likely to take place , the gas metallicity could be much higher than this value .      in the previous sections ,",
    "we have exclusively considered very massive stars that explode as pair - instability sne , i.e. , those with masses @xmath126 .",
    "stars with masses outside this range are likely to leave remnant black holes behind ( fryer et al .",
    "in particular , stars even more massive than @xmath127 completely collapse to black holes , which could be the seeds of supermassive black holes ( madau & rees 2001 ; islam , taylor , & silk 2003 ; volonteri , haardt , & madau 2003 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the evolution of the mass density locked up in black holes using our model population iii sfr .",
    "let us adopt the simplest model where all the population iii stars are extremely massive and become black holes .",
    "although this is an implausible situation because then the igm would remain chemically pristine forever and the `` star - formation conundrum '' would arise ( see schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is illustrative to study the evolution of the black hole mass density in this scenario .",
    "we consider three cases with @xmath128 , and the resulting mass density is plotted in figure [ plot2 ] .",
    "note that our model for the population iii star formation is based on the ` one - star - per - halo ' assumption and thus the star formation rate density scales approximately with @xmath129 .",
    "figure [ plot2 ] shows that the mass density at @xmath4 is comparable to the present - day mass density in black holes in the local universe ( e.g. , merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) for high mass values .",
    "note that these population iii blackholes are likely to have sunk to the galactic centers by the present epoch due to dynamical friction ( e.g. , madau & rees 2001 ) .",
    "obviously , this extreme top - heavy mode of population iii star formation should be stopped at some point .",
    "otherwise too much baryonic mass would be converted into black holes locally by @xmath130 .",
    "one may naively expect that population  iii star formation could continue down to moderate redshifts , @xmath131 .",
    "we argue , based on the results of our model , that either the completion of reionization or prompt enrichment to a level of @xmath132 by @xmath4 should mark the end of the population iii era .",
    "when a large fraction of the igm is reionized , effective photo - evaporation of minihalos by internal and external sources occurs ( e.g. , shapiro , iliev , & raga 2003 ) , and virtually no gas can be trapped within low mass halos .",
    "furthermore , sn explosions cause nearly complete evacuation of the host halos ( see paper  i ) . therefore , regardless of the efficiency of the proposed positive feedback on molecular hydrogen formation ( e.g. , ferrara 1998 ; oh 2001 )",
    ", it should take some time for the heated and expelled gas to cool and _",
    "condense_. subsequent star formation can take place only after the gas falls back into the halos again .",
    "accordingly , there should be an appreciable time gap between the first star formation and the onset of the second - generation star formation .",
    "we conservatively estimate this ` recuperation time ' ( sokasian et al",

    "the dynamical time scale is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the gravitational constant and @xmath135 the total mass density of a halo .",

    "it might seem that halos with virial temperature greater than @xmath141  k are unaffected by photo - heating due to reionization ( e.g. , oh & haiman 2002 ) . we point out that , in the hierarchical universe , _ all _ the massive halos used to be minihalos at earlier epochs . hence , according to our model of population iii star - formation , the gas within them is likely to have been already expelled either by radiation from the population iii stars or by sn explosions",
    ". the situation would be slightly different in halos that are rapidly growing in mass because such halos may be able to trap the ionized hot gas .",
    "however , sn explosions with energies @xmath1 ergs are still able to cause an outward gas flow even in the large halos . if the feedback from the first massive star on its vicinity occurs by z=15 , as in our model , then the formation of the second - generation stars in the same region ( i.e. , protogalaxy ) will begin at @xmath142 .",
    "further , very massive stars are already pulsationally unstable when the metallicity is @xmath143 , even if they are formed ( baraffe et al .",
    "the minimum metallicity floor is established in all the star - forming regions by @xmath4 if the first stars explode as pair - instability sne , thus causing a ` global ' regulation of the star formation activity lasting until @xmath144 .",
    "note that significant cosmic variance may be induced by large - scale ( @xmath145mpc ) density fluctuations .",
    "the cosmic scatter in the number density of the star - forming clouds should then cause a substantial spread in the epoch of self - termination ( e.g. scannapieco , schneider & ferrara 2003 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario for second - generation star formation is self - propagating star formation in the thin , dense shell formed by early sn explosions ( e.g. , ostriker & cowie 1981 ; wandel 1985 ; mccray & kafatos 1987 ) .",
    "such phenomena are indeed observed in the local universe ( e.g. , dopita et al .",
    "1985 ; efremov & elmegreen 1998 ) and may have taken place in the early universe as well ( mackey et al . 2003 ; salvaterra , ferrara , & schneider 2003 ) . for the particular case we simulated in paper i , we found that no gas clumps are formed in the dense shell which are jeans - unstable .",
    "this may , however , be because of the still insufficient mass resolution of the simulation . in order to properly address the question of the shell fragmentation and the formation of proto - stellar clouds , simulations with an extremely high mass resolution",
    "are needed .",
    "also , more complex configurations , such as collisions between neighboring blast waves originating in more massive systems , may result in the formation of gravitationally bound fragments .",

    "in   2 , we have shown that the production of ionizing photons and heavy elements by massive population iii stars is described by fundamental constants in the case where these stars explode as pair - instability supernovae . here , we derive an approximate but concise relationship between the evolution of the mean metallicity and the total thomson optical depth , @xmath146 , as follows .    the differential optical depth to thomson scattering corresponding to the redshift interval @xmath147 is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the thomson scattering cross section , and @xmath150 the mean electron number density at @xmath33 .",

    "remarkably , this is very close to @xmath171 ( figure 1 ) achieved by the early massive population iii stars .",
    "since the population iii star formation is self - regulating owing to the global radiative feedback and metal enrichment , this value is expected to be approximately the maximum which early population iii stars alone can achieve .",
    "songaila ( 2001 ) estimates the mass density of between @xmath172 and @xmath173 to be @xmath174 .",
    "assuming is the dominant ionization stage with ionization fraction of 0.5 ( songaila 1997 ) , the mass density in carbon is @xmath175 . for a very massive zero - metalicity star ,",
    "the carbon yield is @xmath176 and nearly constant for the relevant core mass ( heger & woosley 2002 ) . from this",
    "we obtain the mass density in carbon ( more precisely , @xmath177c ) for our model with @xmath104 , @xmath178 at @xmath136 .",
    "although smaller than the value that songaila ( 2001 ) obtains for the diffuse igm at @xmath6 , this is not negligible .",

    ", the bulk of the metals found in the lyman-@xmath5 forest may also come from ordinary stellar populations formed in galaxies at lower redshift , @xmath179 ( e.g. , adelberger et al .",
    "interestingly , the metallicity evolution computed by hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) based on their analytic model of star - formation in galaxies predicts that the average metallicity reaches @xmath180 at @xmath181 , in good agreement with the observed value in the lyman-@xmath5 forest .",
    "x - ray observations of galaxy clusters reveal that the icm is enriched to a significant fraction of the solar metallicity ( e.g. , mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; white 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , a large fraction ( @xmath182% ) of a typical cluster s endowment with heavy elements exists in the icm rather than in cluster galaxies ( renzini 1997 ) .",
    "clusters retain all the metals produced in them , and the determination of the abundances for several elements in the icm is relatively straightforward , without involving complicated modeling .",
    "thus , the elemental abundances in the icm offer a clean template against which any theoretical models can be tested .",
    "loewenstein ( 2001 ) suggests that pre - enrichment by a generation of massive population iii stars may account for the abundance anomalies of oxygen , silicon and iron , observed in the icm .",
    "the recent analysis of the relative overabundance of si with respect to fe in the icm also indicates the possible contribution from massive population iii stars .",
    "baumgartner et al . ( 2003 ) argue that the observed relative overabundance of si can be explained by population iii progenitors with a 70 @xmath183 he core .",
    "while including the contribution from massive population iii stars is attractive , the required abundance appears very large .",
    "baumgartner et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimate that the total mass in population iii stars should be at least @xmath184 , in units of the cosmic density parameter , whereas our model predicts only @xmath185 at @xmath136 .",
    "baumgartner et al . ( 2003 ) argue that primordial star formation is enhanced in overdense regions which later become clusters .",
    "however , while this might seem plausible , the strong self - regulation of early star formation primarily tends to shift star formation to earlier epochs in overdense regions , rather than locally enhancing the total amount of formed stars .",
    "we therefore conclude that metals originating from the earliest generation stars can not be responsible for the observed abundance anomalies in the icm .",
    "we have computed the mean metallicity of the igm assuming implicitly that all the metals produced and ejected by sn explosions will remain in the gas phase .",
    "this is not strictly true ; a fraction of the metals will be in the form of dust and hence do not directly affect the gas chemical properties ( see however the effect of promoted molecular hydrogen formation discussed later in this section ) .",
    "schneider , ferrara , & salvaterra ( 2003a ) and nozawa et al . ( 2003 ) calculate the dust depletion factor for pair - instability sne to be up to 30 - 40% .",
    "nozawa et al . ( 2003 ) also conclude that the dust formation rate and the relative abundances of the dust grains of various compounds depend sensitively on the mass of the progenitor and on the mixing efficiency in the ejecta .",
    "another complexity is that the produced dust grains are destroyed by thermal sputtering with ions and electrons , and by grain - grain collisions in post - shock regions ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "most important , the reverse shock formed in the early stages of a sn explosion can destroy a significant fraction of the dust grains produced in the ejecta ( mckee 1989 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiency of dust destruction by shocks is not well known and we need to resort to a simple parametrization .",
    "if , for example , the destruction efficiency is very low and nearly all the formed dust grains survive , are dispersed and remain in the igm , the cumulative amount of dust could be significant .",
    "we choose the dust depletion factor to be @xmath187=0.4 ( schneider et al .",
    "2003a ) , and assume a low destruction efficiency , @xmath188=0.1 .",
    "using the global formation rate for population iii stars in equation ( [ eq : sfr_popiii ] ) and assuming @xmath104 , we calculate a conservative upper limit for the mass density of dust in the igm , @xmath189 by @xmath136 .",
    "this is much smaller than , for example , the density of intergalactic dust , @xmath190 at @xmath191 ( aguirre 1999 ; see also pei , fall , & hauser 1995 ; croft et al .",
    "2000 ) , and thus appears to make negligible contribution to the dust in the diffuse igm even if the grains survive until the present epoch .",
    "we point out , however , that even a small quantity of dust in the gas accelerates h@xmath186 production and hence affects the efficiency of gas cooling and star formation when the gas metallicity is still low ( hirashita et al .",
    "todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) argue that h@xmath186 production on dust grains dominates over the usual h@xmath192 channel when the dust - to - gas ratio is greater than 5 percent of the local galactic value @xmath193 .",
    "our model predicts that the mean dust - to - gas ratio is @xmath194 at @xmath136 for @xmath187=0.4 and @xmath188=0.1 , still an order of magnitude smaller than the critical value .",
    "h@xmath186 production on dust grains could still be important if the dust - to - gas ratio were locally high , either because the distribution is inhomogeneous , or because the dust grains remain preferentially within a confined region around the sn site .",
    "it has been suggested that x - rays could act as a source of positive feedback by boosting the free electron fraction in distant regions .",
    "this would in turn promote the formation of h@xmath186 , hence enabling enhanced cooling of primordial gas ( e.g. , haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 ; oh 2001 ; glover & brand 2003 ) .",
    "apart from early quasars ( e.g. , eisenstein & loeb 1995 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ; madau et al .",
    "2003 ) , snrs are the only plausible x - ray sources at very high redshifts .",
    "high redshift snrs cool via inverse - compton cooling , losing a large fraction of their energy to cmb photons ( oh , cooray , & kamionkowski 2003 ) .",
    "some fraction of the thermal energy is also converted into x - rays via thermal bremsstrahlung , and yet another unknown fraction goes into relativistic electrons which could emit x - rays via inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons .",
    "unfortunately , the relative fractions of energy delivered to these processes is highly uncertain , and likely to be time - dependent during the evolution of the snrs . in order to obtain a rough order - of - magnitude estimate",
    ", we calculate the evolution of an early x - ray background using some working assumptions as follows .",
    "we consider only x - rays with energies greater than 1 kev , because the igm is nearly optically thin to these x - rays , and assume further that a fraction @xmath195 of the total sn explosion energy is converted to radiation in the relevant x - ray band , between 1 kev and 5 kev .",
    "we set , somewhat arbitrarily , @xmath196 as our fiducial value .",
    "note that this value is significantly larger than the one assumed by glover & brand ( 2003 ) as a _ maximum _",
    "efficiency case , based on the estimate of terlevich et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for x - ray bright remnants in dense environments , @xmath197 .",
    "hence , the results presented below provide a conservative upper limit .    for the emissivity of the snrs , we rather crudely model it to be described by a power law @xmath198 in the narrow ( 1 - 5 kev ) energy range .",
    "by noting that radiative cooling in the snrs occurs mainly in the first few million years for the original sn energy of @xmath1 ergs ( see section 2.3 ) , the time - averaged luminosity in x - rays from a single snr is estimated to be @xmath199 where @xmath200kev .",
    "we compute the evolution of the diffuse x - ray flux by solving the cosmological radiative transfer equation ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the specific intensity in units of ergs s@xmath20 @xmath203 hz@xmath20 sr@xmath20 , @xmath204 the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath33 , @xmath205 the speed of light , and @xmath206 the proper volume - averaged emissivity .",
    "we use this unconventional unit for the x - ray flux in order to facilitate comparisons with the commonly considered soft - uv background radiation .",
    "we compute the volume emissivity by combining equation ( [ eq : l_nu ] ) with our model sfr ( equation [ 13 ] , see also figure 1 ) , assuming that all the population iii stars die as pair - instability sne ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this simple model again serves as a maximal case in terms of x - ray emission efficiency .",
    "figure [ fig : xray ] shows the evolution of the x - ray background radiation intensity at 1 kev .",
    "it is clear that the flux reaches only up to @xmath207 ergs s@xmath20 @xmath203 hz@xmath20 sr@xmath20 by @xmath136 .",
    "machacek , bryan , & abel ( 2003 ) performed numerical simulations of pre - galactic object formation to examine the effect of the positive feedback from a diffuse x - ray background in the early universe .",
    "they conclude that the net effect is quite small for x - ray fluxes below @xmath208 ergs s@xmath20 @xmath203 hz@xmath20 sr@xmath20 . to result in a positive feedback that counteracts the negative feedback due to photo - dissociating radiation , an order of magnitude higher flux is necessary , which is two orders of magnitude higher than our estimate for the x - ray flux at @xmath136 .",
    "overall , the effect of the early x - ray background caused by snrs to the primordial gas cooling appears unimportant at @xmath209 .",
    "it has often been suggested that the paucity of metal - poor stars in the solar neighborhood relative to the prediction of theoretical models , the so - called g - dwarf problem , can be resolved by invoking early massive population  iii stars ( cayrel 1986 ; see also larson 1998 for a recent review ) .",
    "in fact , the kind of pre - enrichment by early generation stars proposed here may offer an excellent resolution if the metallicity of the gas is sufficiently high initially .",
    "the simplest models require a significant degree of pre - enrichment in the galactic disk ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) , @xmath210 , whereas our model predicts far too small a metallicity accomplished by population iii stars alone , @xmath211 .",
    "thus , considering the self - regulating nature of early star formation ( see  3.1 ) , we conclude that massive population iii stars do little to resolve the classical g - dwarf problem .",

    "chiu , fan , & ostriker ( 2003 ) and avelino & liddle ( 2003 ) indeed showed that strong running of the primordial power results in considerable delay of reionization .",
    "yoshida et al . ( 2003b ) carried out cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of early structure formation and concluded that the running spectral index ( rsi ) model is incompatible with the observed high thomson optical depth .",

    "this practically indicates that , in the rsi model , a top - heavy imf for the stars formed in galaxies must be maintained over a long period , @xmath215 .",
    "the problematic nature of this requirement can be appreciated by noting that the total elapsed time to @xmath216 in a @xmath15cdm cosmology is approximately @xmath217 years .",
    "very massive stars , like those considered here , have lifetimes @xmath218 years . thus , if star formation commences at high redshifts , @xmath219 , nearly 500 generations of these high - mass stars could have formed .",
    "as we indicate below , the metals from these stars must be `` hidden '' to an improbably high degree of precision for population iii star formation not to self - terminate well before @xmath216 .    here",
    ", we show that , in scenarios such as the running spectral index model , a large quantity of metals is necessarily produced if it is assumed that population iii star formation continues until @xmath216 .",

    "it is now clear that , if we resort to the extremely top - heavy imf in the rsi model to produce enough uv photons to reionize the universe early on , the total amount of heavy elements quickly rises up to a point where the gas chemical properties are expected to change ( bromm et al .",
    "it is conceivable that all the massive stars collapse to black holes so that the igm remains chemically pristine without metal - pollution , but then perhaps too much baryonic mass goes into black holes , which appears to be incompatible with the recent estimate of the local mass density in black holes . in summary",
    ", a running of the primordial power spectrum seems to be incompatible with various observations in one way or another .",

    "this may lead to the formation of ordinary stellar populations including low - mass stars ( e.g. mackey et al .",
    "we also discussed possible implications of the results .",
    "although a broad range of observations indicates that the kind of massive stars we considered in the present paper existed in the early universe , the simple model may not be able to explain the observations in details . clearly , further studies using more sophisticated models are necessary to examine the cosmological consequences of early star formation . in particular",

    "<S> the early chemical enrichment history should closely trace the reionization history of the igm , and the end of the population  iii era is marked by the completion of reionization and pre - enrichment by @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , while the pre - enrichment may partially account for the `` metallicity - floor '' in high - redshift lyman-@xmath5 clouds , it does not significantly affect the elemental abundance in the intracluster medium . </S>"
