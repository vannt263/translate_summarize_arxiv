    "measurements of the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons and nucleons allow the extraction of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . while these functions provide crucial input to perturbative quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) calculations , they do not provide a complete picture of the partonic structure of nucleons .",
    "in particular , pdfs contain neither information on the correlations between partons nor on their transverse spatial distribution .",
    "hard exclusive particle production , without excitation or dissociation of the nucleon , have emerged in recent years as prime candidates to address these issues  @xcite . among them , deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) on the proton ( @xmath69 ) is the simplest . the dvcs reaction can be regarded as the elastic scattering of the virtual photon off the proton via a colourless exchange , producing a real photon in the final state . in the bjorken scaling regime , corresponding to large virtuality @xmath5 of the exchanged photon and @xmath70 , where @xmath12 is the squared momentum transfer at the proton vertex , qcd calculations assume that the exchange involves two partons in a colourless configuration , having different longitudinal and transverse momenta .",
    "these unequal momenta , or skewing , are a consequence of the mass difference between the incoming virtual photon and the outgoing real photon and may be interpreted in the context of generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) or dipole amplitudes , respectively . in basic terms , a gpd ( off - diagonal parton distribution ) is the transition amplitude for removing a parton from the fast moving proton and reabsorbing it with a different momentum , thereby imparting a certain momentum transfer to the proton . in the dipole approach",
    "the virtual photon fluctuates into a colour singlet @xmath71 pair ( or dipole ) of a transverse size @xmath72 , which subsequently undergoes hard scattering with the gluons in the proton .",
    "the @xmath12-dependence of the dvcs cross section carries information on the transverse momentum of partons .    in the kinematic range of the hera collider , where dvcs is accessed through the reaction @xmath73",
    "@xcite , the dvcs amplitude is mainly imaginary  @xcite , while the change of the amplitude with energy gives rise to a small real part .",
    "this reaction also receives a contribution from the purely electromagnetic bethe - heitler ( bh ) process , where the photon is emitted from the electron .",
    "the interference between dvcs and bh processes allows the extraction of the real part of the amplitude .",
    "in addition , the real part of the dvcs amplitude can be related to its imaginary part using dispersion relations . in the high energy limit at low momentum fraction @xmath13 ,",
    "the dispersion relations take a simple form  @xcite which can therefore be used for the dvcs process to verify the consistency between measurements of the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude .",
    "this paper presents a measurement of dvcs cross sections as a function of @xmath5 and the @xmath7 centre - of - mass energy @xmath6 .",
    "the single differential cross section @xmath74 is also extracted .",
    "the data were recorded with the h1 detector in the years @xmath75 to @xmath76 , during which period hera collided protons of @xmath77  gev energy with @xmath78  gev electrons and positrons .",
    "the total integrated luminosity of the data is @xmath3  pb@xmath4 .",
    "the data comprise @xmath79  pb@xmath4 recorded in @xmath80 and @xmath81 pb@xmath4 in @xmath82 collisions . during this hera  ii running period",
    ", the electron beam was longitudinally polarised , at a level of typically @xmath83 . for this analysis ,",
    "the periods with left - handed and right - handed beams are combined and the analysed data samples have a left - handed residual polarisation of @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath80 and @xmath82 collisions , respectively .",
    "cross section measurements are carried out in the kinematic range @xmath8  gev@xmath9 , @xmath10  gev and @xmath86 1 gev@xmath9 . the range in @xmath87 of the present measurement extends from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "the cross section measurements of this analysis supersede those of a previous h1 publication  @xcite , in which less than half of the present hera ii data was used .",
    "it is complementary to measurements performed at lower @xmath5 using hera i data  @xcite .",
    "in addition , using both beam charges , the beam charge asymmetry of the interference between the bh and dvcs processes is measured for the first time at a collider .",
    "in this paper , cross section measurements are compared to predictions based either on gpds or on a dipole approach . at the present level of understanding , the pure gpd approach and dipole models , based on the proton - dipole amplitude ,",
    "are not connected .",
    "however , in the low @xmath13 domain , dipole amplitudes could be used to provide parameterisations for gpds at a certain scale  @xcite . in this context , the dvcs process is interesting as calculations are simplified by the absence of an unknown vector meson wave function .",
    "the gpd model  @xcite used here has been shown to describe previous data .",
    "it is based on partial wave expansions of dvcs amplitudes and is a first attempt to parametrise all gpds over the full kinematic domain .",
    "the dipole model  @xcite , with a limited number of parameters , describes a large panel of low @xmath13 measurements at hera , from inclusive to exclusive processes . in this model , mainly using the gluon density extracted from fits to @xmath90 data , the dvcs cross section is computed using a universal dipole amplitude .    for gpd models , a direct measurement of the real part of",
    "the dvcs amplitude is an important issue , as it gives an increased sensitivity to the parameterisation of the gpds  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a calculation of the real part of the dvcs amplitude requires a parametrisation of the gpds over the full @xmath13 range . considering the large flexibility in the parameterisation of the gpds",
    ", this is an important quantity to qualify the correct approach with gpds . in the dipole approach , as the dipole amplitude refers only to the imaginary part , the magnitude of the real part can be predicted using a dispersion relation .    in high energy electron - proton collisions at hera , dvcs and bh processes",
    "contribute to the reaction @xmath73 .",
    "the bh cross section is precisely calculable in qed .",
    "since these two processes have an identical final state , they interfere .",
    "the squared photon production amplitude is then given by    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the bh amplitude , @xmath93 represents the dvcs amplitude and @xmath94 denotes the interference term . in the leading twist approximation , the interference term can be written quite generally as a linear combination of harmonics of the azimuthal angle @xmath95 . as defined in  @xcite , @xmath95 is the angle between the plane containing the incoming and outgoing leptons and the plane formed by the virtual and real photons . for an unpolarised proton beam and",
    "if only the first harmonic in @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which are dominant at low @xmath13  @xcite , are considered , the interference term @xmath94 can be written as    @xmath98,\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 is the charge of the lepton beam , @xmath100 its longitudinal polarisation and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are functions of the ratio of longitudinal to transverse virtual photon flux  @xcite .",
    "cross section measurements which are integrated over @xmath95 are not sensitive to the interference term .",
    "the measurement of the cross section asymmetry with respect to the beam charge as a function of @xmath95 allows to access the interference term .",
    "the beam charge asymmetry ( bca ) of the cross section is defined as    @xmath103    where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the differential @xmath106 cross sections measured in @xmath107 and @xmath108 collisions , respectively .",
    "considering the low residual polarisation of the data and the theoretical expression of @xmath101 and @xmath102  @xcite , @xmath109 and the contribution of the @xmath110 term is neglected .",
    "therefore , @xmath111 can be expressed as    @xmath112    the term @xmath113 can be derived directly from the dvcs cross section measurement @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the slope of the exponential @xmath12-dependence @xmath116 of the dvcs cross section .",
    "as the bh amplitude is precisely known , the measured asymmetry is directly proportional to the real part of the dvcs amplitude and the ratio between real and imaginary parts of the dvcs amplitude , @xmath117 , can be extracted .",
    "this ratio @xmath118 can also be derived using a dispersion relation  @xcite . in the high energy limit , at low @xmath13 and when the @xmath6 dependence of the cross section is parameterised by a single term @xmath119 , the dispersion relation can be written as  @xcite    @xmath120    the ratio @xmath118 can therefore be determined directly from the energy dependence of the dvcs cross section parameterised by @xmath121 .",
    "comparison between the @xmath118 values calculated from the energy dependence of the dvcs amplitude and from its real part therefore provides an important consistency test of the measured bca .",

    "primary particles produced at larger @xmath135 can be detected indirectly in the fmd if they undergo a secondary scattering with the beam pipe or other adjacent material .",
    "therefore , the fmd is used in this analysis to provide an additional veto against inelastic or proton dissociative events .",
