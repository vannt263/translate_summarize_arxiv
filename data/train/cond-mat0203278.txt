    "recently , many examples have been found of systems whose innate topology is not homogenous and can rather be described in terms of a scale - free , random structure .",
    "examples range from the internet to cellular metabolism networks .",
    "the interest of the physics community in this field stems from the fact that the behavior of many systems on such networks or _ graphs _ changes drastically and often attains characteristics close - to but not quite like the mean - field limit .    a scale - free graph consists of a set of nodes or vertices @xmath2 and bonds or edges @xmath3 connecting the vertices to a structure .",
    "the essential measure of the scales or lack thereof is the connectivity or degree distribution of the nodes @xmath2 : the probability of any node to have @xmath4 edges ( one may distinguish between directed and undirected graphs ; in the former case the in - going and out - going pdf s can differ ) .",
    "if this probability @xmath5 follows a power - law behavior , a structure arises that does not have any intrinsic scale .",
    "the internet is an example of such a @xmath6 , and several models have been designed that fit the same description .",
    "later on enhanced models have been devised to capture the characteristics of more elaborate phenomena , like the tendency of clustering  @xcite .",
    "the models lead to evolving graphs which grow continuously in time by the addition of new nodes , with only a limited number of notable exceptions where the scale - free graph is generated by means of a monte - carlo algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath5 and average connectivity become stationary in the thermodynamic limit , save for the tail of the distribution which is subject to finite - size cutoff effects  @xcite . a practically minded question in the same spirit",
    "is the growth mechanism of the internet  @xcite .",
    "it is a common feature of growing networks that they spontaneously develop degree - degree correlations between adjacent nodes  @xcite .",
    "this is a manifestation of the _ preferential attachment _",
    "@xcite principle , where more connected nodes are to attract a larger proportion of new links as the network grows .",
    "one recent study hints that the correlation between neighboring node connectivities is the mechanism behind the logarithmic scaling of the _ network diameter _ or the average shortest distance between two randomly chosen vertices , with respect to the system size  @xcite .",
    "the support for the argument is empirical evidence from simulation results of a broader class of scale - free graph ensembles , where a power law growth of the diameter has been indeed identified .",
    "the question of viability of logarithmic scaling in real - world networks is particularly essential , since it has an impact on efficiency and percolation issues ( communication over the internet , spreading phenomena  @xcite , community structures  @xcite ) .    until recently",
    ", less attention has been paid to the _ probability distribution _ of shortest path lengths or sometimes referred to as chemical distances in scale - free graphs , possibly owing to the fact that it has been implicitly assumed that the average diameter is an adequate measure of distance properties in the networks .",
    "the particular form of the distribution function may have bearings on the performance of search algorithms in scale - free graphs  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of shortest paths has been analytically calculated for the small - world model , employing the underlying lattice structure  @xcite and arriving at a gaussian - like distribution for large system sizes . likewise ,",
    "a model for deterministic scale - free graphs has been proposed and analyzed lately  @xcite , where a gaussian is again obtained in the asymptotic limit .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a subset of scale - free graphs described by the barabsi - albert model  @xcite that in addition are _ loopless rooted trees _ from a topological point of view , i.e. the @xmath1 case where one connects new nodes by only one link to the existing structure . by removing the redundancy of interconnecting loops it is possible to consider the distance properties on a mean - field level , and also to analyze `` load '' or `` betweenness ''  @xcite , the number of any shortest paths passing through vertices .",
    "the essential fact here is that the hub of the tree , e.g. the node with the highest connectivity for simplicity , transmits connections between all the branches emanating from it .",
    "we show that a stochastic branching process rooted in the preferential attachment rule gives rise to the logarithmic scaling of the diameter and that the pdf of the minimal paths approaches a gaussian .    since throughout this text we are interested in tree structures , it is useful to overview their basic features . in the context of random networks ,",
    "one often resorts to ref .",
    "@xcite and the derivation therein , which suggests that the diameter of graphs grows logarithmically .",
    "although the calculations there are performed for random graphs containing loops , the result obtained closely resembles that for _ balanced cayley trees _ with uniform coordination numbers ( except for the coordination number of the central node , which is different ) . according to this",
    ", the number of nodes separated from node zero by @xmath4 nonrecurring steps goes as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coordination number for the cayley tree .",
    "it then follows simply from the sum of a geometric series that both the longest distance between nodes and the average distance should behave as @xmath9 .",
    "it is obvious that trees have unique shortest paths between any two nodes in the sense that without traversing the same edge twice it is not possible to find an alternate minimal route ( unlike in unweighted graphs with loops , where there is usually more than one minimal path ) .",
    "we can then define one of the nodes as the _ root _ of the tree and unambiguously arrange all the other nodes into _ layers _ depending on their minimal distance to the root .",
    "finding the shortest path between two chosen nodes is nothing but identifying the deepest common node along the paths leading from the root to the source and target vertices and then connecting the two nodes via this common fork .",
    "notice that the choice of the root here is slightly arbitrary ; one would prefer to use balanced trees .",
    "we study scale - free barabsi - albert trees  @xcite , starting with a single vertex . in each time",
    "step then we add a new vertex with _ only one _ outgoing edge .",
    "the other end of the edge is connected to one of the nodes already present in the system with a connection probability proportional to the connectivity or degree of a particular node .",
    "all edges are thought of as bidirectional and having the same weight , namely 1 . as a slight modification to the original model ,",
    "the connection symmetry of the first two nodes is broken by introducing a `` virtual '' edge to the very first vertex which only gives preference for this node over the second one when it comes to the subsequent addition of further nodes .",
    "this way , we can automatically identify the most connected node in the network and call it its root . to have a balanced tree",
    "one needs every subtree of the root to have the same number of nodes in the configurational average .",
    "this is only attained when the root is the most connected node , since the ba model ensures that the order of the nodes in terms of connectivity does not change in the course of addition of new nodes and is fully determined by the time of introduction of a node .",
    "to begin with , we will investigate the shortest path distribution in a mean - field model of a tree network , between the root of the tree and all the other nodes .",
    "this argument extends also to _ general graphs _ in the case that the new nodes added ( e.g. @xmath10 barabsi - albert networks ) do not cause a significant amount of shortcuts between already existing nodes .",
    "let us consider a uniform branching process for each of the layers in the tree so that every node on a certain layer has the same number of offsprings to produce the next layer beneath ; it shall amount to @xmath11 for layer @xmath12 for short . this way the original stochastic model is approximated by a deterministic graph  @xcite .",
    "the number of nodes @xmath13 with a separation @xmath12 from the root is then @xmath14 with the condition that @xmath15 .",
    "the actual form of @xmath11 can be obtained by making use of the preferential attachment rule for ba networks . according to this ,",
    "the probability that a newly introduced node will connect to any given set of nodes is proportional to the cumulative connectivity of the set in question .",
    "thus , the number of nodes on layer @xmath16 changes according to the following rate equation , due to the addition of a new node : @xmath17 since the right hand side describes the attachment probability to layer @xmath12 , where @xmath0 is the number of nodes in the system and @xmath18 is the normalization factor for the connectivity . writing @xmath19 , expanding the derivation , and dividing by @xmath20 give @xmath21    if we substitute @xmath22 by explicitly indicating the size dependence on @xmath0 and assume that @xmath23 is a slowly varying function , @xmath24    it is straightforward to expect a solution in the decomposed form of @xmath25 : @xmath26 and since the left hand side is a function of only @xmath0 , @xmath27 with a constant @xmath28 . finally , we get @xmath29 and @xmath30    this relation does not apply to the root ( @xmath31 ) for obvious reasons .",
    "( [ mf_branching ] ) also implies that the number of nodes with a given distance to the root @xmath13 keeps growing with @xmath12 until @xmath11 drops below @xmath32 and then starts to decrease , as the bottom of the tree is approached ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the formal prediction of a constant branching for _ any _ random graph  @xcite , which would result in a monotonous exponential growth , as would be the case in usual cayley trees .",
    "using the recursion relation @xmath14 for the number of nodes on a given level , we can give an estimate for the shortest path distribution function with the source of the paths at the root of the tree . instead of eq .",

    "the consistency condition with the left hand side requires that @xmath56 should hold , and thus @xmath57    disregarding the constant , we end up with a very similar but more general expression than that of eq .",
