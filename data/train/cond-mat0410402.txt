    "this paper is aimed at a theoretical description of the splitting of luminescence lines coming from the deexcitation of a quantum dot in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "there are a few factors contributing to this splitting .",
    "first , there is a contribution coming from the zeeman energy , which is proportional to the magnetic field , @xmath0 .",
    "as luminescence lines arise from exciton recombination , both the electron and hole lande factors enter the expression for the zeeman shift . in a nanostructure , lande factors exhibit a dependence not only on the semiconductor band structure , but also on the geometry . in the recent past",
    ", for example , extensive studies on the dependence on well width @xcite have been conduced . for magnetic fields between 1 and 3 teslas , the typical values we will encounter for the zeeman shifts are 0.05 - 0.2 mev .",
    "a second contribution to the splitting is the so called overhauser shift @xcite .",
    "it is originated in the hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "the electron motion around the nanostructure induces a nuclear spin polarization .",
    "once the nuclear polarization is set up , the interaction of the electron with the thousands of nuclei conforming the dot leads to a measurable shift in the luminescence lines . in a first approximation ,",
    "the overhauser shift does not depend on the magnetic field nor on the quantum dot size , but increases up to a saturation value with the excitation power .",
    "the latter fact can be understood in terms of the increase of the nuclear polarization as the rate of electron - hole pair creation is raised .",
    "typical values of the overhauser shift are around 0.1 mev .",
    "recent measurements of this contribution were done on quantum dots formed from width fluctuations in a well@xcite , and on self - assembled quantum dots@xcite .",
    "there is a third contribution to the splitting , which shall appear when the excitation power is high enough to create multiexcitonic complexes .",
    "recombination of one electron - hole pair from a complex involves coulomb interactions in a nontrivial way . the emission of a right - hand circularly polarized photon proves to be not equivalent to the emission of a left - hand circularly polarized one .",
    "typical values for this shift are around 3 mev , i.e. , the values of energy separations between electronic states in the complex .",
    "these coulomb interaction effects have not been studied experimentally nor theoretically so far .",
    "they constitute the focus of our attention .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present a brief resume of known ideas explaining the experimental results of refs . [ , ] , which correspond to low excitation power and independent exciton recombination . this section is intended as an introduction to sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , where higher excitations are considered .",
    "multiexcitonic complexes are treated in the framework of a corrected bcs scheme , which takes a proper account of mean field coulomb interactions and fermi statistics .",
    "we compute the position and intensities of luminescence lines coming from the decay of systems with up to 21 pairs .",
    "the main results are the absence of overhauser or coulomb interaction effects in complexes with an even number of pairs , and the shell filling effects in the shifts due to coulomb interactions for systems with an odd number of pairs .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "the experiments @xcite are usually performed in the so called faraday configuration , where the excitation laser beam is parallel to the applied magnetic field , and backscattering geometry . a schematic view is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the model parameters are choosen to fit ( at least qualitatively ) the experimental setup described in paper [ ] .",
    "a quasi twodimensional quantum dot is formed from width fluctuations in a 4.2 nm - wide gaas - algaas quantum well .",
    "the dot area is around @xmath3 nm@xmath4 .",
    "taking into account that the gaas lattice constant is @xmath5 .3 nm , the number of nuclei in the dot is @xmath6",
    ".    a simplified two - band structure for gaas is assumed .",
    "a schematics of the band structure is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where electron - hole coupling for each light polarization , and zeeman splitting in each sub - band are indicated .",

    "@xmath12 is the exciton lande factor .",
    "the quantum dot is resonantly excited , i.e. , the laser excitation energy is only a few mev above the luminescence lines .",
    "consequently , in luminescence there is memory of how the dot is pumped .",
    "notice that the sense of rotation of the electric field is inverted for the emitted light .",
    "this means that by pumping with @xmath1 light , for example , we are in fact populating the @xmath2 mode for backward emission .",

    "finally , there is a contribution to the exciton energy coming from the electron - hole exchange interaction in a deformed quantum dot . for the quantum dot under study @xcite",
    ", we have    @xmath34    with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1],[eq3],[eq4 ] ) , and the independent exciton approximation , we write the single pair energy in the form :    @xmath35    where the + index corresponds to @xmath36 ( @xmath1 polarization of the emitted light ) , and the - index to @xmath37 ( @xmath2 polarization of the emitted light ) .",
    "@xmath38 is the contribution of the electron - hole coulomb attraction .",
    "@xmath39 gives , respectively , the position of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 luminescence lines .",
    "the shift between them is    @xmath40    it depends on the excitonic populations , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , through @xmath43 .",
    "the overhauser shift is , by definition ,    @xmath44    it can be measured by turning off the contribution of each nuclear species to the mean nuclear spin with the help of microwave radiation sintonized to the frequency of the corresponding nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite . under @xmath1 pumping , the electron spin polarization is @xmath45 , and the mean nuclear spin is @xmath46 in order to minimize the hyperfine interaction energy .",
    "this means that the overhauser shift is added to the zeeman splitting . under @xmath2 pumping , on the contrary ,",
    "the overhauser shift is substracted from the zeeman splitting .",

    ", the mean exciton number in the dot is less than one . in paper",
    ", there is a study of the dependence of @xmath47 on the excitation power , but what is indeed observed in the single - exciton line is the saturation of the nuclear polarization , @xmath43 , as the occupation of the exciton state increases .    in the present section , we shall discuss the more general situation , where the excitation power is enough to create a few pairs in the dot .",

    "let us first discuss the simplest case beyond the independent exciton approximation : the @xmath60 splitting in the biexciton line .",
    "the lowest biexciton state has @xmath61 .",

    "k , only the ground state will be populated with high probability .",
    "the coulomb contribution to the splitting , eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , is thus zero for the biexciton lines .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the overhauser shift is also zero or , at least , much smaller than the shift for the exciton .",
    "indeed , an intuitive argument suggests that , as the spin polarization is zero in the ground state , the mean nuclear spin will be zero too .",
    "in fact , the situation is a bit more complicated .",
    "one can guess that , as each excitation has a certain weight in the density matrix , exciton states , including the long - lived dark states , play an important role in determining the mean nuclear spin @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a lower value for @xmath43 is expected and , consequently , a lower shift due to the overhauser effect .",
    "there is , nevertheless , a very important effect of coulomb interactions consisting in the concentration of the luminescence in a single , coherent , line , as will become clear below .",
    "the conclusion is that the biexciton lines exhibit a weaken overhauser effect , and no shift coming from coulomb interactions among particles .",

    ", a small disbalance between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is expected under quasiresonant excitation and very low temperatures .",
    "high excitation powers are needed to create the multiexcitonic complexes .    a second , very important , assumption is the coherent ( collective ) character of the decay process .",
    "lines which can be interpreted as single- or independent - pair decays are possible too .",
    "one can guess that these single - pair decays should play an important role in luminescence under a strong confinement regime and well above band gap excitation@xcite . in our calculations",
    ", we assumed an intermediate confinement regime , @xmath75 mev , in which case effects due to coulomb interactions become very important , and the coherent luminescence accounts for more than 80 % of the total luminescence .",
    "the effects of coulomb interactions were shown to be basically the following : and enhancement of luminescence intensity and concentration on a single line , which is shifted with respect to the position of the single - pair decays .",
    "band - filling in the quantum dot is seen as a blueshift of the peak position .",
    "the authors acknowledge the comitee for research of the universidad de antioquia for support .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the electron - hole system in the two - dimensional quantum dot is written as :      where , for simplicity , we have not included electron - hole exchange terms .",
    "@xmath81 is the strength of electron - electron coulomb interactions , whereas @xmath82 and @xmath83 characterize the hole - hole and electron - hole interactions .",
    "the calculations presented in the paper correspond to the symmetric situation , in which @xmath84 .",
    "a factor of 0.8 is included in @xmath85 to approximately account for the quasi two - dimensionality of the dot .",
    "@xmath86 is the oscillator length corresponding to the modified frequency @xmath87 ( to be discussed below ) .",
    "the single - particle electron and hole energies in a harmonic oscillator potential and a magnetic field are given by :          @xmath93 , etc are two - dimensional harmonic oscillator states with characteristic length @xmath92 .",
    "they are specified by the radial quantum number , @xmath94 , the orbital quantum number ( angular momentum projection over @xmath0 ) , @xmath95 , and the spin projection , @xmath96 .",
    "notice that we have not included the zeeman and overhauser contributions to the single - particle energies ( [ eqa2],[eqa3 ] ) .",

    "we shall write , the number of spin - up electrons exactly coincide with the number of spin - down holes , and the number of spin - down electrons with the number of spin - up holes .",

    "( [ eqa1 ] ) , should be minimized with the constraint that the mean values @xmath105 and @xmath106 should be fixed .",

    "the coefficients @xmath112 , satisfying the normalization conditions @xmath113 , are to be used as variational parameters .",
    "notice that                a rather nontrivial fact , which helps understanding the lipkin - nogami scheme , is that the bcs gap equations can also be interpreted as a search for the optimal linear in @xmath41 and @xmath42 approximation to @xmath119 .",

    "it can be written in the form :          a similar expression can be written for @xmath166 .",

    "( [ eqa33 ] ) is hence the probability of decay of individual pairs .",
    "the second term comes from pairing . in our model , at @xmath65 tesla , @xmath178 from the ( 7,6 ) complex , for example , has a component coming from individual decays equal to 5.20 , whereas the pairing contribution reaches the value 59.34 .",

    "<S> we study the splitting between the right - hand and left - hand circularly polarized luminescence lines in a quantum dot under relatively weak confinement regime and resonant high - power excitation . when the dot is populated with an even number of electron - hole pairs ( biexciton and higher excitations ) , the splitting measures basically the zeeman energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the odd number of pairs case , we have , in addition to the zeeman and overhauser shifts , a contribution to the splitting coming from coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution is of the order of a few mev , and shows distinct signatures of shell - filling in the quantum dot . </S>"
