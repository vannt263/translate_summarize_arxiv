    "conformational dynamics is essential for a protein s ability to exhibit allostery .",
    "the coupling between two distant binding sites is frequently accomplished by a conformational change between a `` closed '' ( apo ) to an `` open '' ( holo ) conformation upon ligation.@xcite although the end point conformations often give valuable insight into protein function , a detailed description of the allosteric mechanism for a particular protein requires one to consider a broader conformational ensemble .",
    "the landscape theory of binding@xcite acknowledges that a folded protein is inherently dynamic and explores the thermally accessible conformational states in its native basin.@xcite this conformational ensemble comprises the protein s `` functional landscape''.@xcite while only a small subset of the states comprising the folding energy landscape@xcite , the functional landscape determines how a protein responds to the changes in its local environment such as ligand interactions . due to the heterogeneous nature of the conformational ensemble ,",
    "a ligand preferentially stabilizes some conformations more than others , causing the protein s thermal population to redistribute to a ligated ensemble which in general has distinct equilibrium properties.@xcite the ensemble nature of allostery accommodates a rich and diverse set of regulatory strategies and provides a general framework to understand binding thermodynamics and kinetics of specific proteins.@xcite even simple landscapes with a small number of well defined basins separated by kinetic barriers can have subtle binding mechanisms because they depend on ligand interactions to short - lived transient states .",
    "experimental progress on this challenging kinetics problem has appeared only very recently.@xcite in principle , affinities of metastable states can also be obtained from thermodynamic binding measurements , although such analysis may not always be practical . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the cooperative binding of two ca@xmath0ions to the binding loops of the domains of calmodulin ( cam ) through equilibrium coarse - grained simulations .    in this minimal model , the conformational transition between the open and closed ensembles are simulated explicitly and the dynamic shift in population due to ligand binding and unbinding is approximated by discrete jumps between a ligated and unligated free energy surfaces.@xcite the protein dynamics are governed by a native - centric potential that couples the open and closed conformational basins while ligation is represented implicitly through ligand mediated protein contacts .",
    "this model , developed by takada and co - workers , has been used to investigate the kinetic partitioning of induced fit and conformational selection binding pathways@xcite as well as mechanical unfolding of calmodulin in the presence of ca@xmath0.@xcite here , we assume that the ligands bound to the protein are in equilibrium with a dilute solution and calculate binding thermodynamics as a function of ligand concentration .",
    "the model is parameterized so that the closed basin is more stable than the open basin in the unligated ensemble .",
    "ligands interact with all conformations in the ensemble , but the affinity is largest for conformations within the open basin due to their high structural compatibility with the ligand .",
    "thus , the population shifts towards the open ensemble with increasing ligand concentration ( see _ si",
    "_ fig.s1 ) .",
    "the simulated ensembles have significant molecular fluctuations which modulate ligand affinities and affect the coupling between the binding sites .",
    "when binding thermodynamics are dominated by the open and closed ensembles , this model provides a molecular realization of the celebrated monod - wyman - changeux ( mwc ) model of allostery.@xcite for binding a single ligand the mwc model has four states : unligated - open , unligated - closed , ligated - open , and ligated - closed . appealing to this simple four - state model allows us to extract binding free energies of the isolated sites in the simulated open and closed ensembles and to calculate the free energy associated with the cooperative coupling between the sites .",
    "the simulations connect the conformational ensemble underlying the protein s dynamics with the mwc phenomenological binding parameters.@xcite    early work on binding thermodynamics of cam has revealed that the affinities and cooperativities of the n - terminal domain ( ncam ) and the c - terminal domain ( ccam ) are distinct despite their structural similarity.@xcite although some experimental data has been reanalyzed recently@xcite , the traditional analysis of thermodynamic binding data has not used a dynamic landscape ( or mwc ) framework.@xcite nuclear magnetic resonance experiments@xcite and all atom molecular dynamics simulations@xcite that show a dynamic equilibrium between the open and closed conformations of cam s domains in the absence of ca@xmath0support our approach .",
    "calmodulin ( cam ) is a small , 148 amino acid long protein consisting of two topologically similar domains .",

    "this `` early '' transition to the open ensemble is a reflection of the allosteric cooperativity .",
    "in contrast , the average structural order of the binding loops is similar to the weighted average of the open and closed state flexibility .",

    "the protein conformation modulates the protein - ligand interactions through effective ligand - mediated contacts among residues in the binding site .",
    "the influence of ligand concentration on the effective binding strength is described through its uniform chemical potential .    applying this approach to cam",
    ", we find that this model can distinguish the binding properties of the two domains of cam : binding loops i and ii of ncam have similar affinities , while in ccam , binding loop iii has significantly greater affinity than loop iv . the broader range of binding affinities in ccam accounts for its greater cooperativity .",
    "simulated populations of the ligation states as a function of concentration are accurately described by the mwc model with appropriate binding free energies for the individual loops .",
    "these binding free energies are average properties of the simulated ensemble and are not obvious solely from the open and closed structures .",
    "while the simulated binding thermodynamics is well - described by the mwc model , this simple analysis can obscure complexities in the free energy landscape . in separate publication , we describe how subtle differences in the topology and stability of the two domains lead to distinct simulated mechanisms for ca@xmath0-free domain opening for ncam and ccam ( submitted ) .",
    "in particular , we find that ccam unfolds more readily than ncam during the domain opening transition under similar conditions , a result consistent with the lower thermal stability of the c - terminal domain in the intact protein.@xcite although the unfolded conformations play a minor role in the binding thermodynamics described in this paper ( aside from modifying the binding free energies to the open and closed states ) , global folding and unfolding in the domain opening transition likely has a significant qualitative influence on the binding kinetics .",
