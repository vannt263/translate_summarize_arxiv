    "studying quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition and properties of hot / dense quark matter at high temperature has been the main target of heavy ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "it is now believed that the system created at rhic and lhc is a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) and behaves like a nearly `` perfect '' fluid @xcite .",
    "the collective flow @xmath5 of the highly excited and strongly interacting matter formed at rhic can be well described by relativistic hydrodynamics with a negligible ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculation confirmed that @xmath6 for the purely gluonic plasma is rather small and in the range of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "shear viscosity @xmath8 characterizes how strongly particles interact and move collectively in a many - body system .",
    "in general , the stronger the interparticle interaction , the smaller the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density .",
    "another unusual feature of the strongly interacting matter formed at rhic is that the emission of hadrons with large transverse momentum is strongly suppressed in central collisions  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of hadrons at large transverse momentum is normally referred to as jet quenching , which characterizes the squared average transverse momentum exchange between the medium and the fast parton per unit path length  @xcite .",
    "current knowledge on jet quenching is that it is caused by gluon radiation induced by multiple collisions of the leading parton with color charges in the near - thermal medium @xcite .",
    "therefore , jet quenching can tell us the properties of the created hot dense matter by the energetic parton passing through the medium .",
    "it is very interesting to ask whether transport quantities can characterize phase transitions .",
    "it has been observed that the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath6 has a minimum in the phase transition region in systems of water , helium , nitrogen @xcite and many other substances @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xmath9 is suppressed near the critical temperature in the semi quark gluon plasma @xcite , and @xmath9 can characterize first- , second - order phase transitions and crossover @xcite , i.e. @xmath9 shows a cusp , a jump at @xmath2 and a shallow valley around @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "in @xcite it has been suggested that the jet quenching parameter can also be used to measure the coupling strength of the medium and a general relation between the shear viscosity @xmath6 and the jet quenching parameter @xmath10 for a quasi - particle dominated quark - gluon plasma has been derived , i.e. @xmath11 . the relation associates a small ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density to a large value of the jet quenching parameter .",

    "therefore phenomenologically , it appears that there are now strong evidences for a nontrivial temperature dependence , in particular the near-@xmath2 enhancement , of jet - medium coupling on matter temperature .",
    "= 6.5 cm = 6 .",
    "cm + = 6.5 cm = 6 .",
    "cm +    theoretically , however , there has been very limited way to figure out the precise form of such t - dependence due to the highly non - perturbative nature of this temperature regime .",
    "the holographic approach provides a useful way to gain insight into this problem . in the previous section",
    ", we ve used the holographic qcd model with non - conformal dynamics to calculate the @xmath155 .",
    "as clearly seen fig.[qhatovert ] , the scaled jet - medium coupling @xmath10 shows strong enhancement in the vicinity of @xmath2 , while in contrast any conformal holographic model will show no t - dependence for the @xmath10 .",
    "we also emphasize that the same holographic model also describes the trace anomaly ( with strong peak near @xmath2 ) in thermodyanics . with such t - dependence obtained from the holographic model here ,",
    "it is of great interest to see its phenomenological implications .",
    "here we use the simple geometric energy loss model as in @xcite to study the @xmath4 and @xmath5 at high @xmath12 for rhic which are most sensitive to such t - dependence .",
    "let us assume that the final energy @xmath161 of a jet with initial energy @xmath162 after traveling an in - medium path @xmath163 ( specified by the jet initial spot and momentum direction ) can be parameterized as @xmath164 with the @xmath165 given by @xmath166 \\",
    ", s(l ) \\ , l dl   \\right\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath167 is the local entropy density along the jet path , while the @xmath168 represents the local jet - medium interaction strength which depends on the local density @xmath167 ( or equivalently the temperature t ) .",
    "we choose to explicitly separate out the density @xmath87 itself , and the combination @xmath169 corresponds to @xmath125 . to implement the holographic model results for @xmath125 , we use @xmath170 = \\xi \\cdot   [ \\hat{q}/t^3]$ ] with @xmath10 given as in fig.[qhatovert ] and with @xmath171 just one parameter to be fixed by the most central collisions @xmath172 for 0 - 5% centrality class and then used for other computations .",
    "we use optical glauber model to sample initial jet spots according to binary collision density and we determine a medium density from participant density with longitudinal boost - invariant expansion . it is known that there are strong initial state fluctuations , but since we are focusing on the average @xmath4 and the dominant geometric anisotropy component @xmath5 which is dominantly from geometry and the current approach is reasonable ( for a detailed discussions of the initial fluctuations for hard probe see e.g.  @xcite ) . in our simulations for each given impact parameter we compute the energy loss for 1 million jet paths with different initial spots and orientations , and extract the @xmath4 : @xmath173 where @xmath174 means averaging over all jet paths with azimuthal orientation @xmath160 and including all sampled initial jet production spots .",
    "the exponent @xmath175 comes from reference p - p spectrum at the same collision energy : @xmath176 for @xmath177 tev .",
    "the so - obtained @xmath159 in each event can be further fourier decomposed as @xmath178 $ ] .",
    "the overall quenching @xmath4 as well as the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath5 can then be determined .    in fig.[rhic_comparison ]",
    ", we show the results for @xmath4 and @xmath5 at high @xmath12 for rhic with the input t - dependent jet - medium interaction from our non - conformal holographic model ( the thick blue curves ) . for comparison",
    "we also show the results from conformal model i.e. with @xmath10 being constant in qgp phase ( the thin red curves ) .",
    "the data are from phenix measurements in @xcite . as one can see , while both types of models describe the @xmath4 well , the non - conformal model shows a sizable improvement over the conformal model in getting closer to the data",
    ". of course our current non - conformal model still does not give enough anisotropy , which implies that the t - dependence of jet - medium coupling in this model may still show less near-@xmath2 enhancement than the phenomenologically favored form . such discrepancy at quantitative level",
    "may not be unexpected due to a number of issues .",
    "after all the holographic model used here is supposed to be an effective description dual to pure gluodynamics and strictly speaking may not be suitable for direct application to full qcd phenomenology .",
    "first of all , in real qcd case with crossover transition there is the `` hadronic '' side ( i.e. the sizable contribution for @xmath125 when t is smaller but close to @xmath2 )  @xcite which is missing in the current holographic model with 1st order transition . furthermore , the entropy density here ( only counting the gluons essentially ) is also different from full qcd where there are quarks too , and that in general would shift the peak toward lower density region in the present model .",
    "one might attempt to `` cook up '' certain extrapolative ways of accounting for such differences and thus improve the agreement with data .",
    "we however feel that would weaken the internal rigor and consistency of the holographic model approach , and would add very little to our main purpose which is not to claim success in description of data but to demonstrate the consequence of non - conformal dynamics in our holographic model on the jet energy loss phenomenology .",
    "let us end by reiterating our main points here : 1 ) there are strong non - conformal , non - perturbative dynamics going on in the near-@xmath2 region ( which is modeled via holography here by introducing quadratic terms ) ; 2 ) such dynamics leads to non - monotonic behavior in qgp thermodynamics as shown by the strong near-@xmath2 peak of trace anomaly ( which is well modeled by holography ) ; 3 ) the same dynamics leads to non - monotonic behavior in qgp transport properties and in particular strong near-@xmath2 enhancement of jet - medium coupling ; 4 ) phenomenologically the t - dependence of @xmath125 from non - conformal holographic model considerably improves the description of jet quenching azimuthal anisotropy as compared with the conformal case .",
    "we have investigated qcd phase transition and jet quenching parameter @xmath0 in the framework of dynamical holographic qcd model .",
    "the thermodynamical properties in this dynamical holographic qcd model agree well with lattice results for pure gluon system .",
    "it is found that both the trace anomaly @xmath139 and the ratio of the jet quenching parameter over cubic temperature @xmath1 show a peak around the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "it is also noticed that the ratio of jet quenching parameter over entropy density @xmath3 sharply rises at @xmath2 , which is similar to the behavior of bulk viscosity over entropy density @xmath14 .",
    "the enhancement of jet quenching parameter around @xmath2 indicates that , like the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density @xmath6 and the ratio of bulk viscosity over entropy density @xmath14 , the ratio of jet quenching parameter over entropy density @xmath3 can also characterize the phase transition .",
    "the effect of jet quenching parameter enhancement around phase transition on nuclear modification factor @xmath4 and elliptic flow @xmath5 have also been analyzed , and it is found that the t - dependence of @xmath125 from non - conformal dynamical holographic model can considerably improve the description of jet quenching azimuthal anisotropy as compared with the conformal case .    here",
    "are several remarks about the dynamical holographic qcd model we used in this work : 1 ) we have only considered the graviton - dilaton coupled system for the pure gluon system , it is interesting to see in the future how the behavior of jet quenching parameter changes by including dynamical quarks and how it will affect @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; 2 ) we have only considered the gluonic matter above @xmath2 , one needs to construct the thermal gas below @xmath2 in order to get the @xmath1 behavior in the hadron gas ; 3 ) one should also consider how to distinguish the energy loss of gluons and quarks @xcite in the framework of holography qcd .",
