    "biogenic sulfide corrosion of concrete is a bacterially mediated process of forming hydrogen sulfide gas and the subsequent conversion to sulfuric acid that attacks concrete and steel within wastewater environments .",
    "the hydrogen sulfide gas is oxidized in the presence of moisture to form sulfuric acid that attacks the matrix of concrete .",
    "the effect of sulfuric acid on concrete and steel surfaces exposed to severe wastewater environments ( like sewer pipes ) is devastating , and is always associated with high maintenance costs .",
    "the process can be briefly described as follows : fresh domestic sewage entering a wastewater collection system contains large amounts of sulfates that , in the absence of dissolved oxygen and nitrates , are reduced by bacteria .",
    "such bacteria identified primarily from the anaerobic species desulfovibrio lead to the fast formation of hydrogen sulfide ( @xmath0 ) via a complex pathway of biochemical reactions . once the gaseous @xmath0 diffuses into the headspace environment above the wastewater , a sulfur oxidizing bacteria  primarily thiobacillus aerobic bacteria  metabolizes the @xmath0 gas and oxidize it to sulphuric acid .",
    "it is worth noting that thiobacillus colonizes on pipe crowns above the waterline inside the sewage system .",
    "this oxidizing process prefers to take place where there is sufficiently high local temperature , enough productions of hydrogen sulfide gas , high relative humidity , and atmospheric oxygen ; see section [ chemistry ] for more details on the involved chemistry and transport mechanisms .",
    "good overviews of the civil engineering literature on the chemical aggression with acids of cement - based materials [ focussing on sulfate ingress ] can be found in @xcite .",
    "if we decouple the mechanical corrosion part ( leading to cracking and respective spalling of the concrete matrix ) from the reaction - diffusion - flow part , and look only to the later one , the mathematical problem reduces to solving a partly dissipative reaction - diffusion system posed in heterogeneous domains .",
    "now , assuming further that the concrete sample is perfectly covered by a locally - periodic repeated regular microstructure , averaged and two - scale reaction - diffusion systems modeling this corrosion processes can be derived ; that is precisely what we have done in @xcite ( formal asymptotics for the locally - periodic case ) and @xcite ( rigorous asymptotics via two - scale convergence for the periodic case ) .    here , our attention focusses on the two - scale corrosion model . besides performing the averaging procedure and ensuring the well - posedness of the resulting model(s ) , we are interested in simulating numerically the influence of the microstructural effects on observable ( macroscopic ) quantities .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , where we performed numerical simulations of such a two - scale model .",
    "now , is the right moment to raise the main question of this paper :    _ is the two - scale finite difference scheme used in @xcite convergent , i.e. , does it approximate the weak solution to the two - scale system ? _",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is a wealth of multiscale numerical techniques that could ( in principle ) be used to tackle rd systems of the type treated here .",
    "we mention at this point three approaches only : ( i ) the multiscale fem method developed by babuska and predecessors ( see the book @xcite for more refs . ) , ( ii ) computations on two - scale fem spaces @xcite / two - scale galerkin approximations @xcite , and ( iii ) the philosophy of heterogeneous multiscale methods ( hmm ) @xcite .",
    "we choose to employ here multiscale finite differences ( multiscale fd ) mimicking the [ two - scale ] tensorial structure present in ( ii ) .",
    "our hope is to become able to marry at a later stage the two - scale galerkin approximation ideas from @xcite in a hmm framework eventually based on finite differences .",
    "our standard reference for fd - hmm idea is @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ background ] introduces the reader to the physico - chemical background of the corrosion process , two - scale geometry , and setting of the equations . the numerical scheme together with basic ingredients like discrete operators , discrete green formulae , discrete trace inequalities etc .",
    "are presented in section [ sec : numerical - scheme ] , while the approximation estimates together with the interpolation ( extension ) and compactness steps are the subject of section [ compactness ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with section [ illustration ] containing numerical illustrations of the discrete approximation of the weak solution .",
    "we consider the evolution of a chemical corrosion process ( sulfate attack ) taking place in one - dimensional macroscopic region @xmath1 , @xmath2 , that represents a concrete sample along a line perpendicular to the pipe surface with @xmath3 being a point at the inner surface in contact with sewer atmosphere and @xmath4 being a point inside the concrete wall .",
    "since we do not take into account bulging of the inner surface due to the growth of soft gypsum structures , the shape of the domain @xmath5 does not change w.r.t .",
    "the time variable @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the typical microstructure ( or standard cell @xcite ) by @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "usually cells in concrete contain a stationary water film , and air and solid fractions in different ratios depending on the local porosity .",
    "generally , we expect that , due to the randomness of the pores distribution in concrete , the choice of the microstructure essentially depends on the macroscopic position @xmath9 , i.e. , we would then have @xmath10 ; see @xcite for averaging issues of double porosity media involving locally periodic ways of distributing microstructures , and @xcite for more comments directly related to the sulfatation problem where pores are distributed in a locally periodic fashion . in this paper , we restrict to the case when the medium @xmath5 is made of the _ same _ microstructure @xmath11 periodically repeated to pave perfectly the region .",
    "furthermore , since at the microscopic level the involved reaction and diffusion processes take place in the pore water , we choose to denote by @xmath11 only the wet part of the pore .",
    "efficient direct computations ( with controlled accuracy and known convergence rates ) of scenarios involving @xmath10 as well as the corresponding error analysis are generally open problems in the field of multiscale numerical simulation .",
    "sewage is rich in sulphur - containing materials and normally it is without any action on concrete . under suitable conditions like increased temperature or lower flow velocity oxygen in sewage can become depleted .",
    "aerobic , purifying bacteria become inactive while anaerobic bacteria that live in slime layers at the bottom of the sewer pipe proliferate .",
    "they obtain needed oxygen by reducing sulfur compounds .",
    "sulfur reacts with hydrogen and forms hydrogen sulfide ( @xmath12 ) , which then diffuses in sewage and enters sewer atmosphere .",
    "it moves in the air space of the pipe and goes up towards the pipe wall .",
    "gaseous @xmath12 ( further denoted as @xmath13 ) enters into the concrete pores ( microstructures ) via both air and water parts . @xmath13",
    "diffuses quickly through the air - filled part of the porous structure over macroscopic distances , while it dissolves in the thin , stationary water film of much smaller , microscopic thickness that clings on the surface of the fabric .",
    "there are many chemical reactions taking place in the porous microstructure of sewer pipes which degrade the performance of the pipe structure depending on the intensity of the interaction between the chemical reactions and the local environment . here",
    "we focus our attention on the following few relevant chemical reactions :    [ eq : reaction - equations ] @xmath14    dissolved hydrogen sulfide ( further denoted as @xmath15 ) undergoes oxidation by aerobic bacteria living in these films and sulfuric acid @xmath16 is produced ( reaction ) .",
    "this aggressive acid reacts with calcium carbonate ( i.e. , with our concrete sample ) and a soft gypsum layer @xmath17 consisting of solid particles ( unreacted cement , aggregate ) , pore air and moisture is formed ( reaction ) .",
    "the model considered in this paper pays special attention to the following aspects :    * exchange of @xmath0 from water to the air phase and vice versa ( reaction ; * production of gypsum at micro solid - water interfaces ( reaction ) .",
    "the transfer of @xmath0 is modeled by means of ( deviations from ) the henry s law , while the production of gypsum is incorporated in a non - standard non - linear reaction rate , here denoted as @xmath18 ; see for a precise choice .",
    "equation indicates the linearity of the henry s law structure we have in mind .",
    "the standard reference for modeling gas - liquid reactions at stationary interfaces ( including a derivation via first principles of the henry s law ) is @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) be the time interval during which we consider the process and let @xmath5 and @xmath11 as described in section [ geometry ] .",
