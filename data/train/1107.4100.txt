    "<S> we present an interpretation of recent experimental measurements of @xmath0 in suspended bilayer graphene samples . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the data may be quantitatively described by assuming a spatially varying inter - layer potential asymmetry ( which generates a band gap ) induced by local electric fields resulting from charged impurity disorder in the graphene environment . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the fluctuations in the inter - layer potential asymmetry and density vary between different samples , and that the potential asymmetry fluctuations increase in magnitude as the density fluctuations increase . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the mechanism causing this effect is likely to be extrinsic . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide predictions for the optical conductivity and mobility of suspended bilayer graphene samples with small band gaps in the presence of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the fabrication of suspended bilayer graphene ( blg ) devices @xcite has allowed the direct local measurement of the thermodynamic quantity @xmath1 using scanning single electron transistor spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important quantity to study since it is linked directly to thermodynamic observables such as the thermodynamic density of states , electronic compressiblility and the quantum capacitance of the interacting electron liquid in the blg . in samples mounted on a sio@xmath2 substrate , </S>",
    "<S> the level of disorder is generally too high for the intrinsic physics near the charge neutrality point to be seen because of the existence of strong inhomogeneity ( electron - hole puddles ) induced by the disorder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , suspended samples provide a setting where the effective strength of the impurities is reduced as reflected , for example , in the enhanced mobility@xcite and it is likely that the low - density physics is more readily accessible . in the experiments@xcite , a region of decreased compressiblilty ( or equivalently a peak in @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> is seen near the charge - neutrality point in zero magnetic field indicating the possible presence of a small gap in the low energy band structure . </S>",
    "<S> it is claimed @xcite that the size of the gap which generates this peak is approximately @xmath4 , and that the magnitude of charge inhomogeneity is of the order of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .   </S>",
    "<S> state that castro _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite show that this level of in - plane charge inhomogeneity by itself would create a gap which is a factor of 10 smaller than that observed , ruling out disorder - induced fluctuations as a mechanism for the generation of this gap . </S>",
    "<S> instead , they claim@xcite that this peak is evidence for a correlated ground state of the interacting electron liquid , such as one of those proposed in the recent literature @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . some of these proposed states may induce a spontaneous many - body charge transfer instability in the bilayer system which could open a small band gap at zero density , and the region of decreased compressibility seen in the experiments may be evidence for the formation of one of these charge - transfer - instability states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we believe that this interpretation of the experimental results is problematic because the out - of - plane charge imbalance which would drive a disorder - induced gap is not the same quantity as the inplane charge inhomogeneity which martin _ et al . _ use@xcite to estimate the gap size . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is important to look more closely at the role of disorder in the suspended bilayer graphene system to investigate in depth the issue of the possible existence ( or absence ) of a many - body quantum phase transition creating a spontaneous band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the current work is to carry out such a phenomenological investigation to see whether random charge impurities in the bilayer environment could produce a signature in the compressibility consistent with the observations of refs .  .    </S>",
    "<S> transport measurements suggest that there are some residual impurities in the environment of the suspended graphene , each of which will have an electric field associated with it , and it is well established that the electrons in the blg order themselves into puddles of electrons and holes in order to screen these fields @xcite . additionally , it was shown recently @xcite that these electric fields also cause a spatial variation in the interlayer potential asymmetry which is highly correlated with the disorder profile . </S>",
    "<S> this is a different effect from the inplane reorganization of charge , and the two effects may in principle be of quite different magnitudes , and both are likely to be present in disordered bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> although this interlayer effect was reported for bilayer graphene supported on a substrate@xcite , the general principle applies to suspended samples as well .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we revisit the issue of density fluctuations induced by charged impurity disorder , and show that our calculation of @xmath3 by averaging over the density of the electrons in the puddles@xcite can be applied in two different phenomenological ways to this situation and gives results for the gap fluctuations , density fluctuations , and required charge imbalance which are self - consistent . by fitting this theory to measurements of @xmath3 from two different devices@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the gap and charge inhomogeneity are device - dependent , which is , of course , not unexpected since disorder in different devices is likely to be different leading to different interlayer potential asymmetry in each sample . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the transport characteristics associated with our phenomenological disorder fits are reasonable , and predict that in an optical spectroscopy experiment , the gap will still be obscured by disorder in these samples@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since our results are internally consistent , we claim that the mechanism of local density fluctuations induced by charged impurity disorder can not be ruled out as a cause of the observed@xcite peak in @xmath3 at low carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> our work by no means eliminates the possible occurence of a many - body blg instability , it just establishes the qualitative and quantitative importance of disorder in thinking about the quantitative aspects of the observed effects , and points out that there is a possible single - particle extrinsic cause for the observed effective gap , namely , the inter - layer potential asymmetry induced by the random charged impurities in the blg environment . in reality </S>",
    "<S> , both interaction and disorder may be present in a non - perturbative manner , making a microscopic theoretical analysis quite challenging , particularly since the graphene landscape becomes inhomogeneous due to the formation of electron - hole puddles in the presence of the charged impurity disorder .    in order to model the clean blg system </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the continuum limit of the tight - binding hamiltonian . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions are described by bloch functions modulated by a spinor , the elements of which correspond to the four sites in the blg unit cell@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we make this assumption despite the fact that the inhomogeneity in the disorder potential breaks translational symmetry because we assume that the changes in the potential landscape are spatially slowly varying enough that the physics associated with p  </S>",
    "<S> n junctions or quantum dots do not manifest . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that this theory has been very successful in describing capacitance - based compressibility experiments in samples which are much dirtier than those we currently discuss@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is determined by the relative strength of electron hopping between the four lattice sites . to simulate the experimental situation as accurately as possible , </S>",
    "<S> we go beyond the standard nearest - neighbor tight binding formalism ( where @xmath6 is the fermi velocity of monolayer graphene which comes from the intra - layer hopping between adjacent atoms and @xmath7 is the energy associated with the inter - layer dimer bond which generates the finite effective mass at low energy ) by including the next - nearest neighbor inter - layer hops with energy @xmath8 and the onsite energies given by the lattice site asymmetry @xmath9 and a potential asymmetry @xmath10 between the two layers . </S>",
    "<S> this potential asymmetry directly generates a band gap at the k point of the band structure , and we shall therefore use the terms ` inter - layer potential asymmetry ' and ` gap ' synonymously in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for one valley is then @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 the lattice constant , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the radial and angular part of the wave vector measured from the k point . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is valley - symmetric and isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 terms is to introduce an asymmetry between the low - energy conduction and valence bands , and has previously been used to explain an observed asymmetry in capacitance measurements @xcite . using the results collated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> we choose representative parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the band structure and @xmath3 in the absence of disorder in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of puddles of carriers in graphene is a well - established phenomenon both in experiment and in theory@xcite . in a previous paper@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we introduced the macroscopic averaging over density fluctuations and applied this theory to measurements of the capacitance of blg devices finding good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of the theory is that the potential fluctuations associated with charged impurity disorder generates a spatially - varying on - site term in the tight - binding hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn leads to a local fluctuation in the fermi energy and hence in the carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of this fluctuation can be encapsulated within a distribution function @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the tip of the set and the electron liquid in the bilayer graphene is capacitative , so we assume that each region with a given carrier density has a local capacitance associated with it . </S>",
    "<S> then , the total capacative coupling of the set to the sample is the parallel coupling of all of the areas , which equates to the geometrical average over the region sampled by the set . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the areal average can be replaced by an average over the charge density distribution @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the dimension of the region sampled by the set in the experiments of ref . </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath22 whereas the puddle size seen in ref . </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath23 so that the averaging should be reasonable in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that this philosophy deliberately retains the inhomogeneity of the system and treats it as the primary manifestation of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this is a fundamentally different approach from , for example , a diagrammatic expansion of the electron  impurity interaction which contains within it an average over realizations of disorder which explicitely restores the translational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the important disorder physics to be included in the low - density regime of graphene near the charge neutrality point is the formation of electron - hole puddles in the system around the discrete quenched charged impurity centers leading to strong spatial inhomogeneity modelled by the distribution function @xmath21 mentioned above which has been calculated in the literature in a few instances @xcite and measured in experiment for a bare sio@xmath2 substrate@xcite . for density fluctuations associated with puddles of carriers in graphene systems we write the local density as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average density induced by external gates and the fluctuations are encapsulated within @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we parameterize these fluctuations by their standard deviation @xmath27 , and computing the average of @xmath3 over the probability distribution for the density results in the following expression for the average inverse compressibility @xmath28 the distribution function @xmath21 is talken as the following gaussian @xmath29 ,      \\label{eq : pdef}\\ ] ] since there is compelling theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite evidence that this is approximately the correct form . in this theory , </S>",
    "<S> the layer asymmetry @xmath30 is constant in space ( hence the subscript ` @xmath31 ' ) and is generated by either external electric fields ( such as those from gates ) or by an asymmetry of charge between the two layers of the blg generated by the intrinsic electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> analytical evaluation of this procedure is not possible since , for finite @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are the roots of a quartic polynomial . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the published data@xcite ( which we shall denote by the label prl ) is quantitatively described by a constant gap @xmath39 with density fluctuations characterized by @xmath40 , which is very close to the values claimed by martin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in their paper@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the unpublished data@xcite ( denoted by pc , as in ` private communication ' ) is described by @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a different degree of in - plane charge homogeneity and different size of gap is required to describe the experimental data in each sample which is perfectly reasonable since we expect the disorder to have sample - to - sample variations . also , the band gap required to fit the data is larger for the more strongly disordered sample </S>",
    "<S> . the opposite would be true if the gap was the result of an intrinsic interaction - driven effect since in this case , the gap due to interactions would be universal , but disorder would work to reduce its size@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these results , particularly the fact that the more strongly disordered sample exhibits the larger effective experimental band gap , indicate that there is some role being played by extrinsic effects in these experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> we now introduce another step in this theory , motivated by recent observations of spatial fluctuations in the interlayer potential asymmetry in bilayer graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interlayer asymmetry was measured in electron puddles and in hole puddles of a bilayer graphene flake which was mounted on an sio@xmath2 substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the asymmetry of approximately @xmath43 was seen between the two puddles at zero back gate voltage , and an associated band gap was seen in the spectrum of landau levels measured via stm . </S>",
    "<S> although we expect that the magnitude of this effect will be smaller in suspended samples , the presence of disorder - induced puddles ( as demonstrated above by our fitting to the appropriate theory ) means that it is sensible to assume that the same disorder may also induce ( albeit smaller in magnitude ) local fluctuations in the potential asymmetry just as it does in graphene on substrates in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the potential asymmetry becomes a function of position such that @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations are contained within @xmath45 , and we assume that they can be described by the distribution @xmath21 with standard deviation @xmath38 ( just as the density fluctuations can ) because the same disorder is generating both types of fluctuation . note that it is the in - plane component of the electric field associated with disorder which causes the formation of puddles , while the spatially varying inter - layer potential asymmetry is driven by the out - of - plane component of the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , while we expect the two types of fluctuation to be correlated , it is not obvious exactly what relationship should exist between them . </S>",
    "<S> however , on a phenomenological level , we can treat @xmath27 and the potential asymmetry fluctuations parameterized by @xmath38 as independent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore perform an average over the gap fluctuations in the same way we previously did for the density . </S>",
    "<S> the spatially varying part of the band gap @xmath45 is described by @xmath38 , and the gaussian is centered around @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial average then corresponds to the following average over the distribution function : @xmath47 we call this procedure ` double averaging ' . in order to assess </S>",
    "<S> if the observed gap might be entirely due to disorder - induced fluctuations , we fit this expression with @xmath36 to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the fitting parameters are now @xmath48 and @xmath27 , so we have two parameters as was the case for the density averaging procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the results are displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : averagefits](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the prl data is fitted by @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the pc data by @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit of the double - averaged theory is actually slightly better than that which is averaged only over density ( especially in the region of the peak ) , but both averaging procedures give results which are in reasonable agreement with the experiment and therefore it is not possible to distinguish between a spatially fluctuating disorder - induced gap and a uniform intrinsic gap in the current data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our work convincingly demonstrates they key importance of disorder , particularly the density and potential fluctuations associated with the inhomogeneous puddles , in determining the experimental compressibility measurements of refs .  .     and </S>",

    "<S> the experimental measurements of @xmath3 in the prl data suggest that the size of the uniform gap , if it exists , is approximately @xmath4 . since this is of the same order as the gap predicted by extrapolating to the clean limit , we have run fits of our double - averaged theory with a constant gap of this size to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is no improvement in the fitting for any value of @xmath27 or @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> to explain this , we need to analyze the distribution function for the gap fluctuations . we know that @xmath3 is an even function of the gap size @xmath10 , and </S>",
    "<S> therefore the absolute value @xmath60 is the key for determining the distribution of @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig : gaussians ] shows the distribution @xmath53 for the cases @xmath64 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in all but the last case , the distribution is dominated by small values of @xmath65 because of the significant contribution from the @xmath66 term , and it is only when @xmath67 that the gaussian shape is revealed in @xmath53 . in the two sets of data which we have studied , </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath68 found from the single averaging procedure and the @xmath38 from the double averaging obey the relation @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the disorder is too strong to determine if a spontaneous gap exists in the absence of disorder . in order to measure the spontaneous gap , samples with levels of disorder such that @xmath70 are needed </S>",
    "<S> this necessitates the development of samples with much higher quality ( i.e. less disorder ) , perhaps mobilities which are a factor of five or so larger , to decisively establish the existence of a spontaneous many - body blg gap . in short </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : optcond ] ]    the gap size may also be extracted from measurements of the optical conductivity via absorption or reflection experiments @xcite . to demonstrate that this may be an unreliable process in the case of the small band gaps ( of the order of a few mevs ) we are discussing in this context , we plot in fig . </S>",

    "<S> when the fermi energy is in the sombrero ( low density ) region with @xmath72 , the flatness of the bands means that this density fluctuation corresponds to a fluctuation of less than 1@xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we include the disorder through a constant broadening of the bands parameterized by the energy @xmath78 which appears in the green s function as @xmath79 the optical conductivity is calculated from this green s function from the following expression@xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the spin and valley degeneracies , and @xmath83 figure [ fig : optcond ] shows that for @xmath84 , the peak due to the onset of the intraband conductivity is already significantly blurred . by the time @xmath85 , the peak is completely smeared , as shown by the @xmath86 line . </S>",

    "<S> however , our calculation also shows that for small density fluctuations ( i.e. shallow electron - hole puddles ) the transport gap can be induced by the smaller energy gap . in the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sig](b ) the conductivity of suspended blg calculated within the effective medium theory @xcite is shown for two different charged impurity densities , @xmath109 and 4@xmath110 for a fixed short range potential @xmath88 ( ev)@xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation shows the minimum conductivity at the charge neutral point is higher for a low mobility ( more strongly disordered ) sample .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that even though suspended graphene samples are known to be significantly less disordered than those mounted on substrates , the effect of disorder in recent measurements of @xmath0 can not be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> using phenomenological averaging procedures , which specifically incorporate the effects of strong inhomogeneous broadening arising from electron - hole puddle induced spatial density and potential fluctuations , we have demonstrated that current experimental data can not distinguish between an intrinsic , spatially uniform band gap generated by electron - electron interactions , and a spatially fluctuating band gap induced by disorder . specifically , these disorder - induced fluctuations can account for the observed data without invoking the presence of an intrinsic gap@xcite . in order to be confident about the origin of the band gap , higher quality samples where @xmath111 must be fabricated . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is to carry out measurements on blg samples fabricated on bn substrates which typically have much lower charged impurity disorder @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the theory we develop involves exactly one uncontrolled approximation , assuming the density fluctuations and the fluctuations in @xmath10 to be uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond this approximation would require knowledge about the details of the local electric fields producing the fluctuations in @xmath33 and @xmath10 which is currently unavailable experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> it would be straightforward to include the correlation in our theory if microscopic information about the correlator between fluctuations in @xmath33 and @xmath10 is available from experiments or some other microscopic calculations . in the absence of such information we assumed them to be independent .    </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasize that the theory presented in this article is phenomenological and is a first step toward the understanding of the role of disorder in the experiments of refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> what we have achieved in this paper is a demonstration that spatial density and potential fluctuations are capable of producing a spatially fluctuating gap consistent with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> many questions of details could be raised with respect to our phenomenological procedure , for example , the averaging procedure we employ is certainly not unique , but in the presence of real spatial fluctuations which explicitly break the translational invariance in graphene near the dirac point , our procedure is physically motivated as it averages precisely over the quantities which fluctuate according to some distribution function which has been calculated in the literature @xcite . a better ( purely numerical ) method to tackle </S>",
    "<S> the problem would be to use the techniques developed in refs .   </S>",
    "<S> to explicitly and self - consistently calculate the real - space electronic structure in the presence of the electron - hole puddles generated by the random charge impurities , and then to use this real - space electronic structure to directly numerically calculate the compressibility . </S>",
    "<S> such a calculation is obviously numerically prohibitively difficult , and our work is a short - cut ( albeit a rather simple one ) in carrying out such a numerical procedure . since the gaussian probability distribution function we use is numerically well - verified in refs .   through self - consistent calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we believe that our results , although phenomenological , should be qualitatively and quantitatively valid . the eventual theory involving a microscopic calculation of the compressibility in the presence of long - range coulomb disorder and electron - electron interaction including </S>",
    "<S> the realistic band structure of bilayer graphene is very far in the future since no one knows how to approach such a non - perturbative problem even at a formal level .    </S>",
