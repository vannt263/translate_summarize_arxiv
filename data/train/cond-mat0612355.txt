    "micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) technology has been developed rapidly in recent years.@xcite~@xcite the characteristic length scale of mems is typically the order of microns , and the ratio of the mean free path to the characteristic dimension ( i.e. knudsen number @xmath2 ) can not be negligible .",
    "the dynamics associated with microchannels can thereby exhibit rarefied phenomena and compressibility effects .",
    "the former is the emergence of a slip velocity at the wall boundary in microchannel flows .",
    "the latter is the significant nonlinear pressure drop of gas flowing in a long microchannel . because conducting experiments in micrometer - size is a big challenge , numerical simulations of mems become very important tools of investigation .",
    "but the methods commonly used in simulation of mems , such as molecular dynamics ( md ) , direct simulation monte ",
    "carlo ( dsmc)@xcite and direct numerical simulation of boltzmann equation , usually requires a tremendous amount of computer time and memory .",
    "recently , for its intrinsic kinetic nature , the lattice boltzmann method ( lbe ) has been become an attractive method for simulation of microscalar flows where both microscopic and macroscopic behaviors are coupled.@xcite    form its birth nearly 20 years ago ( 1988)@xcite , the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm)@xcite~@xcite has met with significant success for the numerical simulation of a large variety of fluid flows , and has emerged as an alternative numerical technique for simulating fluid flows .",
    "the lbe method usually solves the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) model equation , a simplified model boltzmann equation , on a discrete lattice , which is usually named the lattice - bgk ( lbgk ) model.@xcite since theoretical connections between the lbgk model and the boltzmann equation@xcite and the preliminary link between lbgk model and the burnett - type equations@xcite were established , the lbe model can be valid for rarefied gas flow provided the mach number is small .",
    "moreover , since the standard bgk equation is able to simulate highly non - equilibrium gas flows , the lbgk model should also be applicable to rarefied microflows theoretically.@xcite~@xcite    one of the most important issues of lbgk model for simulating microchannel flows is the introduction of @xmath2 number into lb models .",
    "the popular treatment is the construction of the relationship between @xmath2 and relaxation time @xmath0 of lb models .",
    "_ used the explicit lbe formulation and related the nondimensional relaxation time @xmath3 to knudsen number @xmath2 as : @xmath4 for a microchannel of height @xmath5 and gas density @xmath6 .",
    "the factor 0.5 attributes to the explicit treatment of the collision term and @xmath7 is chosen to best match the simulated mass flow rate with experiments.@xcite later , lim _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite proposed a different relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the explicit lbe formulation without the correction factor of 0.5 as in nie _",
    "et al._. their @xmath2 for a long microchannel was defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the local pressure and pressure at the outlet of the microchannel , respectively .",
    "_ gave different definitions of @xmath3 with different constant factors among various lattice models.@xcite recently , lee _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a definition of @xmath0 about fully implicit lbe.@xcite    another one is the implementation of boundary condition .",
    "_ used the half bounce - back rule for the slip effect at the surface .",
    "et al . _ used a specular reflection model to generate slip effect .",
    "et al . _ adopted the maxwellian scattering kernel to address the gas molecule and surface interactions with an accommodation coefficient @xmath7 .",
    "proposed a wall equilibrium condition according to the assumption of rough surface on the characteristic length of gas molecules .",
    "for the former issue , the previous research is still related to the framework of navier  stokes equations .",
    "this is because the expression of the kinetic viscosity coefficient derived from the lb equation recovering the navier  stokes equations , is still adopted in the makeup of the relationship of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath2 approaches zero , the boltzmann equation can be reduced to the navier  stokes equation .",
    "but all the existing lbe for microscale flow can not be reduced to the navier  stokes equation because of using the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the previous researchers always focus on recovering the navier ",
    "stokes equations precisely from the lbgk model and ignoring the deviation of the lbgk model and boltzmann equation .",
    "this deviation may not do any effect in simulation of macroscale flows .",
    "however , the character scale of microflows is much smaller . in such a case , keeping the collision consistency of the lbgk model and boltzmann equation should be paid special attention .",
    "this collision consistency requires the collision frequency of lbgk model is equal to that of bgk model equation . with the further study on the relaxation factor @xmath0 , we found that these two collision frequency are equivalent when @xmath1 and the simulation results are the most approximate .",
    "this principle is called collision consistency of lbgk model .    on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary treatment is based on the maxwell slip model straightforwardly .",
    "there is not any adjustable parameter in our model and is similar to the newmann boundary condition in some degree .",
    "the implement is not related to the navier ",
    "stokes equations any more , so it can be applied in simulating microflows not only in slip regime but also in transition regime .",

    "the above discrete lbgk equation is usually solved in two steps : collision step and streaming step .",
    "so the physical process in lbgk model can be regarded as a large number of particles take place one collision , through the distance @xmath32 and the time @xmath27 .",

    "consequently , @xmath31 means the ratio of the collision frequency of the lbgk model to that of the bgk model . from the gas dynamics , the collision frequency @xmath17 is in direct proportion to the density , and in dependence on temperature , but independence of molecular velocity . in order to furthest approach to bgk model",
    ", the collision frequency of the lbgk model should be equal to that of the bgk model , i.e. @xmath34 . especially in the microflows ( @xmath35 ) , the collision consistency must be much more ensured for the collision frequency of molecule in the microflows is far lower than that in the macroscopical flows ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that lbgk model is between the bgk equation and navier  stokes equations .",
    "we formerly attached importance to recover the lbgk to navier ",
    "stokes equations in the simulation with lbgk model , but now we should pay sufficient attention to the consistency of the lbgk model with the bgk equation , especially in simulation of the microflows .",

    "( [ fievol ] ) can be simplified as : @xmath45 the distribution function @xmath23 evolved in the lattice actually is the equilibrium distribution function @xmath46 .",
