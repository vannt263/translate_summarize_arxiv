    "the next generation gravitational - wave detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite and kagra @xcite interferometers , are expected to detect gw signals from mergers of two compact objects .",
    "these gravitational wave bursts ( gwbs ) have well defined `` chirp '' signal , which can be unambiguously identified .",
    "once detected , the gw signals would open a brand new channel for us to study the universe , especially the physics in the strong field regime . due to the faint nature of gws , an associated electromagnetic ( em ) emission signal in coincidence with a gwb in both trigger time and direction would increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the gw signal , and therefore would be essential for its identification .",
    "one of the top candidates of gwbs is merger of two neutron stars ( i.e. ns - ns mergers ) @xcite .",
    "the em signals associated with such an event include a short gamma - ray burst ( sgrb ) @xcite , an optical `` macronova '' @xcite , and a long lasting radio afterglow @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that binary neutron star mergers could eject a fraction of the materials , forming a mildly anisotropic outflow with a typical velocity about @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the speed of light ) , and a typical mass about @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radioactivity of this ejecta powers the macronova and the interaction between the ejecta and the ambient medium is the source of radio afterglow .",
    "usually , the merger product is assumed to be a black hole or a temporal hyper - massive neutron star which survives 10 - 100 ms before collapsing into the black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , recent observations of galactic neutron stars and ns - ns binaries suggest that the maximum ns mass can be high , which is close to the total mass of the ns - ns systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . indeed , for the measured parameters of 6 known galactic ns binaries and a range of equations of state",
    ", the majority of mergers of the known binaries will form a massive millisecond pulsar and survive for an extended period of time @xcite .",
    "when the equation of state of nuclear matter is stiff ( see arguments in @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) , a stable massive neutron star would form after the merger .",
    "this newborn massive neutron star would be differentially rotating .",
    "the dynamo mechanism may operate and generate an ultra - strong magnetic field @xcite , so that the product is very likely a millisecond magnetar .",
    "evidence of a magnetar following some sgrbs has been collected in the swift data @xcite , and magnetic activities of such a post - merger massive neutron star have been suggested to interpret several x - ray flares and plateau phase in sgrbs @xcite .    since both the gravitational wave signal and the millisecond magnetar wind both nearly isotropic",
    ", a bright electromagnetic signal can be associated with a ns - ns merger gwb regardless of whether there is a short gamma - ray burst ( sgrb ) - gwb association @xcite . even if there is an association , most gwbs",
    "would not be associated with the sgrb since sgrbs are collimated .",
    "@xcite proposed that the near - isotropic magnetar wind of a post - merger millisecond magnetar would undergo magnetic dissipation @xcite and power a bright x - ray afterglow emission . here",
    "we suggest that after partially dissipating the magnetic energy , a significant fraction @xmath4 of the magnetar spin energy would be used to push the ejecta , which drives a strong forward shock into the ambient medium .",
    "the continuous injection of the poynting flux into the blast wave modifies the blast wave dynamics and leads to rich radiation signatures @xcite .",
    "figure 1 presents a physical picture for several em emission components appearing after the merger .",
    "we here study the dynamics of such an interaction in detail , and calculate broadband afterglow emission from this forward shock .",
    "the postmerger hyper - massive neutron star may be near the break up limit , so that the total spin energy @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 for a massive neutron star ) may be universal . here",
    "@xmath7 ms is the initial spin period of the proto - magnetar . throughout the paper , the convention @xmath8 is used for cgs units , except for the ejecta mass @xmath9 , which is in unit of solar mass @xmath10 .",
    "given nearly the same total energy , the spin - down luminosity and the characteristic spin down time scale critically depend on the polar - cap dipole magnetic field strength @xmath11 @xcite , i.e. @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and the spin down time scale @xmath14 , where @xmath15 cm is the stellar radius .",
    "after the internal dissipation of the magnetar wind that powers the early x - ray afterglow @xcite , the remaining spin energy would be added to the blastwave .",
    "the dynamics of the blastwave depends on the magnetization parameter @xmath16 of the magnetar wind after the internal dissipation . since for the confined wind , magnetic dissipation occurs upon interaction between the wind and the ejecta , in this paper , we assume that the wind is still magnetized ( moderately high @xmath16 ) , so that there is no strong reverse shock into the magnetar wind @xcite . as a result , the remaining spin energy is continuously injected into the blastwave with a luminosity @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the fraction of the spin down luminosity that is added to the blastwave .",
    "the evolution of the blastwave can be described by a system with continuous energy injection @xcite .",
    "the newly formed massive magnetar is initially hot .",
    "a poynting flux dominated outflow is launched @xmath19 s later , when the neutrino - driven wind is clean enough @xcite . at this time",
    ", the front of the ejecta traveled a distance @xmath20 cm ( for @xmath21 ) , with a width @xmath22 cm .",
    "the ultra - relativistic magnetar wind takes @xmath23 s to catch up the ejecta , and drives a forward shock into the ejecta .",
    "balancing the magnetic pressure and the ram pressure of shocked fluid in the ejecta , one can estimate the shocked fluid speed as @xmath24 , which is in the same order of forward shock speed .",
    "so the forward shock would cross the ejecta in around @xmath25 .",
    "note that when calculating magnetic pressure , we have assumed a toroidal magnetic field configuration in the poynting flux , but adopting a different magnetic configuration would not significantly affect the estimate of @xmath26 .    after the forward shock crosses the ejecta , the forward shock ploughs into the ambient medium .",
    "the dynamics of the blastwave during this stage is defined by energy conservation should be @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the initial lorenz factor for the ejecta , which we take as unity for convenience . ]",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the swept mass from the interstellar medium .",
    "initially , @xmath31 , so the kinetic energy of the ejecta would increase linearly with time until @xmath32 , where the deceleration timescale @xmath33 is defined by the condition @xmath34 . by setting @xmath35 , we can derive a critical ejecta mass @xmath36 which separate regimes with different blastwave dynamics . for a millisecond massive magnetar , the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are all essentially fixed values .",
    "the dependence on @xmath40 is very weak ( 1/8 power ) , so the key parameters that determine the blastwave parameters are the ejecta mass @xmath9 and the magnetar injection luminosity @xmath41 ( or the magnetic field strength @xmath42 ) .",
    "if @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) , the ejecta can be accelerated linearly until the deceleration radius , after which the blastwave decelerates , but still with continuous energy injection until @xmath45 .",
    "conversely , in the opposite regime ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) , the blastwave is only accelerated to @xmath45 , after which it coasts before decelerating at @xmath48 . in the intermediate regime of @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) , the blastwave shows a decay after being linearly accelerated .",
    "there is another critical ejecta mass , which defines whether the blastwave can reach a relativistic speed .",
    "this is defined by @xmath51 . defining a relativistic ejecta as @xmath52 ,",
    "this second critical ejecta mass is @xmath53 an ejecta heavier than this would not be accelerated to a relativistic speed .",
    "below we discuss four dynamical regimes .",
    "_ case i : @xmath43 or @xmath54 .",
    "_ this requires both a small @xmath41 ( or low @xmath42 ) and a small @xmath9 .",
    "we take an example with @xmath55 ( @xmath56 g ) and @xmath57 . to describe the dynamics in such a case ,",
    "besides the spin down timescale @xmath58 , we need three more characteristic time scales and the lorentz factor value at the deceleration time @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the two time scales when the blastwave passes the non - relativistic to relativistic transition line @xmath61 during the acceleration and deceleration phases . with these parameters , one can characterize the dynamical evolution of the blastwave ( fig.[i]a ) , as shown in table 1 .",
    "based on the dynamics , we can quantify the temporal evolution of synchrotron radiation characteristic frequencies @xmath62 , and the peak flux , @xmath63 .",
    "the evolutions of the characteristic frequencies are presented in fig.[i]b and collected in table 2 .    following the standard procedure in @xcite",
    ", we derive the synchrotron radiation characteristic frequencies and the peak flux density at @xmath33 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 . with the temporal evolution power law indices of these parameters ( table 2 )",
    ", one can calculate the x - ray , optical and radio afterglow lightcurves .",
    "notice that there are two more temporal segments listed in table 2 , since @xmath66 crosses @xmath67 twice at @xmath68 respectively .",
    "we present the light curves in x - ray ( fig.[i]d ) , optical and radio ( 10ghz ) band ( fig.[i]c ) .",
    "the distance is taken as 300 mpc , the detection horizon of advanced ligo .    _",
    "case ii : @xmath49 or @xmath69 . _",
    "the dynamics and the expressions of the characteristic parameters become simpler : @xmath70 the temporal indices of the evolutions of @xmath71 are listed in table 2 , and the expressions of @xmath72 and @xmath73 are shown in table 1 .    as examples",
    ", we consider @xmath74 ( @xmath75 g ) vs. @xmath76 , which satisfies @xmath77 .",
    "similarly to case i , we have @xmath78    the expressions of @xmath72 and @xmath73 as well as the power - law indices for this case are also presented in table 1 and table 2 , respectively . the dynamics typical frequency evolution , and the light curves are presented in fig.[ii ] .",
    "we note that in this case ( and case iii ) , the synchrotron radiation properties are very sensitive to @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "_ case iii : @xmath79 _ ( @xmath80 ) . as an example , we take @xmath81 g , and @xmath82 .    for this example , the dynamics and the expressions of the characteristic parameters become @xmath83 and @xmath84    the power - law indices of various parameters for this case are also collected in table 2 , and the dynamics , frequency evolutions , and light curves are presented in fig .",
    "[ iii ] .    _ case iv : @xmath85 . _ in this case , the blast wave never reaches a relativistic speed .",
    "the dynamics is similar to case iii , with the coasting regime in the non - relativistic phase .",
    "the dynamics for a non - relativistic ejecta and its radio afterglow emission have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "our case iv resembles what is discussed in @xcite , but the afterglow flux is much enhanced because of a larger total energy involved .",
    "for all the cases , bright broadband em afterglow emission signals are predicted .",
    "the light curves typically show a sharp rise around @xmath58 , which coincides the ending time of the x - ray afterglow signal discussed by @xcite due to internal dissipation of the magnetar wind .",
    "the x - ray afterglow luminosity predicted in our model is generally lower than that of the internal dissipation signal , but the optical and radio signals are much brighter . in some cases ,",
    "the r - band magnitude can reach 11th at the 300 mpc , if @xmath9 is small enough ( so that the blastwave has a high lorentz factor ) and the medium density is not too low . the duration of detectable optical emission ranges from @xmath86 seconds to year time scale .",
    "the radio afterglow can reach the jy level for an extended period of time , with peak reached in the year time scale .",
    "these signals can be readily picked up by all - sky optical monitors , and radio surveys .",
    "the x - ray afterglow can be also picked up by large field - of - view imaging telescopes such as iss - lobster .",
    "since these signals are originated from interaction between the magnetar wind and the ejecta in the equatorial directions , they are not supposed to be accompanied with short grbs , and some internal - dissipation x - ray afterglows @xcite in the free wind zone . due to a larger solid angle",
    ", the event rate for this geometry ( orange observer in fig.1 ) should be higher than the other two geometries ( red and yellow observers in fig.1 ) .",
    "however , the brightness of the afterglow critically depends on the unknown parameters such as @xmath9 , @xmath42 ( and hence @xmath41 ) , and @xmath40 .",
    "the event rate also crucially depends on the event rate of ns - ns mergers and the fraction of mergers that leave behind a massive magnetar rather than a black hole .",
    "this afterglow signal is much stronger than the afterglow signal due to ejecta - medium interaction with a black hole as the post - merger product @xcite .",
    "the main reason is the much larger energy budget involved in the magnetar case .",
    "since the relativistic phase can be achieved , both x - ray and optical afterglows are detectable , which peak around the magnetar spindown time scale ( @xmath87 s ) .",
    "the radio peak is later similar to the black hole case @xcite , but the radio afterglow flux is also much brighter ( reaching jy level ) due to a much larger energy budget involved . the current event rate limit of @xmath88 mjy radio transients in the minutes - to - days time scale at 1.4 ghz is @xmath89 @xcite , or @xmath90 all sky . in view of the large uncertainties in the ns - ns merger rate and the fraction of millisecond magnetar as the post - merger product ,",
    "our prediction is entired consistent with this upper limit .",
    "because of their brightness , these radio transients can be detected outside the advanced ligo horizon , which may account for some sub - mjy radio transients discovered by vla @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed another possible em counterpart of gwb with a wide solid angle .",
    "they did not invoke a long - lasting millisecond magnetar as the merger product , but speculated that during the merger process , a breakout shock from the merging neutron matter would accelerate a small fraction of surface material , which reaches a relativistic speed .",
    "such an outflow would also emit broad - band synchrotron emission by shocking the surrounding medium . within that scenario ,",
    "the predicted peak flux is lower and the duration is shorter than the electro - magnetic signals predicted in @xcite and this work , due to a much lower energy carried by the outflow .",
    "detecting the gwb - associated bright signals as discussed in this paper would unambiguously confirm the astrophysical origin of gwbs .",
    "equally importantly , it would suggest that ns - ns mergers leave behind a hyper - massive neutron star , which gives an important constraint on the neutron star equation of state . with the gwb data",
    ", one can infer the information of the two nss involved in the merger .",
    "modeling afterglow emission can give useful constraints on the ejected mass @xmath9 and the properties of the postmerger compact objects .",
    "therefore , a combination of gwb and afterglow information would shed light into the detailed merger physics , and in particular , provide a probe of massive millisecond magnetars and stiff equations of state for neutron matter .",
