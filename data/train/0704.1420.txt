    "we study the renormalization of qcd in the coulomb gauge hamiltonian formalism . by hamiltonian form ,",
    "we mean that the lagrangian contains only first order terms in time derivatives , and depends upon the conjugate momentum field @xmath0 as well as the ( transverse ) gluon field @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is the colour index and @xmath3 is a 3-vector index ) .",
    "this form has a number of attractive features :    \\(i ) as a hamiltonian exists , the theory is explicitly unitary , without the necessity to cancel unphysical degrees of freedom with ghosts .",
    "\\(ii ) the lagrangian form of the coulomb gauge has `` energy divergences '' in some of its feynman integrals , that is integrals of the form ( we use @xmath4 for the spatial part of the 4-vector @xmath5 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 does not decrease as @xmath8 ( for fixed @xmath4 ) .",
    "these divergences cancel between different feynman graphs @xcite , but this cancellation has to be organized `` by hand '' . in the hamiltonian form ,",
    "each individual feynman graph is free of such divergence .",
    "divergent integrals such as @xmath9 are assigned the value zero .",
    "\\(iii ) it has been argued @xcite that the coulomb gauge throws light on confinement .",
    "certainly it is known @xcite that , in the coulomb gauge , the source of asymptotic freedom lies in the coulomb potential .    in spite of ( i ) above , to 2-loop order",
    ", mild energy - divergences remain @xcite , @xcite , @xcite which result in ambiguities which have to be resolved by a prescription .",
    "this is connected with questions of operator ordering @xcite .    for other applications of the coulomb gauge , for example to lattice qcd , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the question addressed here is the following .",
    "ultra - violet divergences exist which seem to require the existence of counter - terms containing second order terms in time derivatives , @xmath10 .",
    "do these take us out of the hamiltonian form ?",
    "we argue that this does not happen because the divergences concerned can be cancelled by a redefinition of the @xmath11 field .",
    "we do not use quite the strict hamiltonian formalism .",
    "we retain the auxilliary field @xmath12 , which contains no time derivatives and should be integrated out to give a nonlocal coulomb potential term in the real hamiltonian .",
    "it seems to be convenient , for the purposes of renormalization , to retain @xmath12 in the lagrangian .",
    "because of this , there is a ghost field , but it has an instantaneous propagator , and so is not relevant to unitarity .",
    "its purpose is only to cancel out closed loops in the @xmath12 field .",
    "the lagrangian for the coulomb gauge is @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 will eventually tend to zero to go to the coulomb gauge ) ,    @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17\\ ] ] @xmath18\\ ] ] @xmath19 where we use a colour vector notation , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 here @xmath22 are the ghost fields , and the sources @xmath23 and @xmath24 are inserted for future use in formulating the brst identities .",
    "the conjugate momentum ( electric ) field @xmath25 could be integrated out to obtain the ordinary lagrangian formalism , but for the hamiltonian formalism it must be retained",
    ".    we will use indices @xmath26 to denote the ( spatial ) components of @xmath27 , so the seven fields are @xmath28 .",
