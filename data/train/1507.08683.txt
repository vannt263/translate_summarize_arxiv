    "mesoscopic vibrational systems typically have several nonlinearly coupled modes .",
    "these can be flexural modes in the case of nanomechanical resonators@xcite , photon and phonon modes in optomechanics@xcite , or modes of microwave cavities in circuit quantum electrodynamical systems@xcite .",
    "often different modes have significantly different frequencies , so that the interaction between them is primarily dispersive .",
    "a major effect of such interaction is that the frequency of one mode depends on the amplitude of the other mode .",
    "the related shift of the mode frequency provides a means of characterizing the coupling strength where both modes can be accessed , cf",
    ". refs . and can be used for quantum nondemolition measurements of the oscillator fock states.@xcite however , often only one mode can be accessed and controlled , and the presence of dispersive coupling has to be inferred from the available data .",
    "an important consequence of dispersive coupling is that amplitude fluctuations of one mode lead to frequency fluctuations of the other mode @xcite .",
    "the amplitude fluctuations come from the coupling to a thermal reservoir , but they can also be of nonthermal origin . the mode - coupling induced frequency fluctuations broaden the spectrum of the response to an external force and the power spectrum .",
    "such broadening has been suggested as a major broadening mechanism for flexural modes in carbon nanotubes @xcite , graphene sheets@xcite , doubly clamped beams@xcite as well as microcantilevers.@xcite    separating the mode - coupling induced fluctuations from other spectral broadening mechanisms is a nontrivial problem , see ref .   for a recent review of the broadening mechanisms .",
    "the most familiar broadening mechanism is vibration decay due to energy dissipation .",
    "another mechanism of interest for the present paper is internal vibration nonlinearity . because of such nonlinearity , the frequency of a vibrational mode depends on the mode amplitude , and thermal fluctuations of the amplitude lead to frequency fluctuations .",
    "this is reminiscent of the mode - coupling effect , yet is coming from a different type of nonlinearity .",
    "we show below how these mechanisms can be clearly distinguished .    in this paper , we propose a means for identifying and characterizing the mode - coupling induced frequency fluctuations .",
    "the approach is based on studying the power spectrum of the considered mode in the presence of periodic driving .",
    "it does not require access to other modes and the ability to characterize them , as in refs .",
    ", for example .",
    "the approach relies on the fact that , quite generally , frequency fluctuations lead to the features in the power spectrum of a periodically driven mode , which do not occur without such fluctuations.@xcite if one thinks of the driven mode as a charged oscillator in a stationary radiation field , these features correspond to fluorescence and quasi - elastic light scattering .",
    "the absence of the latter effects in the case of a periodically driven linear oscillator with constant frequency is a textbook result.@xcite    the analysis of the power spectra of driven modes with fluctuating frequency in ref .",
    "was phenomenological .",
    "the results were obtained in some limiting cases and in the case of gaussian fluctuations . the dispersive mode coupling leads to strongly non - gaussian frequency fluctuations .",
    "the simplest type of such coupling corresponds to the coupling energy @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coordinate of the considered driven mode and @xmath2 is the coordinate of the mode to which it is dispersively coupled and which we call the @xmath3-mode .",
    "where the modes are far from resonance , the frequency change of the considered mode is proportional to the period - average value of @xmath4 .",
    "even where @xmath5 is gaussian , as in the case of thermal displacement of a linear mode,@xcite the squared displacement @xmath6 is not .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop the necessary tools and to reveal the features of the spectra related to the dispersive - coupling induced frequency fluctuations .",
    "these features depend on the interrelation between the typical magnitude of the frequency fluctuations @xmath7 , their reciprocal correlation time @xmath8 , and the decay rate of the considered mode @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that all these parameters are small compared to the mode eigenfrequencies and their difference .    in the absence of driving ,",
    "the power spectrum and the linear response spectrum have the form of a convolution of the spectrum of the considered mode taken separately and a function that depends on the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite we call @xmath11 the motional narrowing parameter to draw the similarity ( although somewhat indirect ) with the motional narrowing effect in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr).@xcite for @xmath12 the correlation time of the frequency fluctuations is comparatively small . then the fluctuations are averaged out and their effect is small , as in the case of fast decay of correlations in nmr . on the other hand , for @xmath13",
    ", the spectrum can be thought of as a superposition of partial spectra , each for a given value of the period - averaged @xmath4 .",
    "the weight of the partial spectrum is determined by the probability density of the period - averaged @xmath4 .    in the presence of driving",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "the first distinction is that , without the dispersive coupling , there is no driving - induced part of the power spectrum at all , except for the trivial @xmath14-peak at the driving frequency .",
    "based on the previous results , @xcite we expect that the driving - induced part of the spectrum will strongly depend on the interrelation between the rates @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear that it will also strongly depend on @xmath11 , but this dependence is not known in advance .",
    "the formulation below is in the classical terms .",
    "however , the results fully apply also to the case where the considered driven mode is quantum , i.e. , its energy level spacing is comparable or exceed the temperature .",
    "it is essential for the analysis that the @xmath3-mode is classical ; the case where the @xmath3-mode is in the deeply quantum regime is in a way simpler , as the dispersive coupling can be resolved in the power spectrum without driving.@xcite      an important part of the paper is the averaging over the fluctuations of the @xmath3-mode .",

    "here , one can think of the amplitude and phase of forced vibrations as being determined by the detuning of the instantaneous mode frequency from the driving frequency .",
