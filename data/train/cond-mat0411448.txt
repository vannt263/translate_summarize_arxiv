    "isotope controlled synthesis ( ics ) of molecular nanostructures provides an important degree of freedom to characterize fundamental and application oriented properties .",
    "ics is generally considered as a tool to e.g. enhance nuclear magnetic resonance signals , to provide improved information when specific isotope labelling is possible or to trace biological processes using radioactive nuclei . for fullerenes @xcite",
    ", ics was applied to improve the nmr data @xcite , to identify the origin of different vibrational modes in crystalline c@xmath2 @xcite , and to yield an insight into underlying physical phenomenon such as the mechanism of the superconductivity in alkali doped fullerides @xcite by means of @xmath0c enrichment .",
    "more recently , @xmath0c enriched fullerenes were used to produce @xmath0c enriched single wall carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "properties of fullerenes can be also studied through the synthesis of on - ball doped modifications .",
    "the c@xmath1n or c@xmath1b heterofullerenes were predicted to provide a doping opportunity for c@xmath2 andreonicpl1992@xcite . in general , heterofullerenes possess a rich chemistry due to their enhanced reactivity as compared to pristine fullerenes @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath1n azafullerene can be synthesized in macroscopic amounts @xcite@xcite and in a solid form it is an insulator consisting of ( c@xmath1n)@xmath3 dimer units where the extra electrons are localized in the dimer bonds as singlet states pichlerprl1997 . the c@xmath1n monomer radical",

    "this c@xmath1n : c@xmath5 solid solution was synthesized in a discharge tube designed for the production of n@c@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the latter synthesis method over the chemical synthesis @xcite are its relative simplicity and the ability of providing an isotope control option by changing the @xmath4n@xmath3 gas to @xmath6n@xmath3 .",
    "recently , it was shown that the extra electron on the c@xmath1n is transferred toward the c@xmath2 s at high temperatures and it provides a controllable electron doping of the crystalline c@xmath2 @xcite .    here",

    "_ sample preparation . _ commercial @xmath0c isotope enriched fullerene mixture ( mer corp . , tucson , usa ) was used for the synthesis of c@xmath1n .",

    "the supplier provided a @xmath0c enrichment of nominal 25 % that was determined using mass spectrometry .",
    "the isotope enriched fullerenes are denoted as @xmath9 and @xmath10n in the following .",
    "we refer to the material with the nominal @xmath11 @xmath0c content , although this value is slightly refined in this work . apart from the c@xmath12 and other higher fullerenes with contents up to 20 % ,",

    "pietzakcpl for the production of n@c@xmath2:c@xmath2 . in brief",
    ", fullerenes are sublimed into a nitrogen discharge that is maintained by a high voltage between two electrodes inside a quartz tube filled with a low pressure of n@xmath15 gas .",
    "c@xmath1n : c@xmath2 deposits on surfaces with temperatures between 200 - 400 @xmath16c of the quartz tube , whereas n@c@xmath2:c@xmath2 deposits on the water - cooled cathode .",
    "the resulting material is collected from the tube walls and is resublimed at 500 @xmath16c twice in order to remove impurities that are usually produced during the synthesis and to reduce the amount of higher fullerenes @xcite .",

    "typically 10 mg of final material containing @xmath17n at 2000 ppm concentrations in @xmath18 is produced from 100 mg starting fullerene material .",

    "in fig . [ ramanspectra ] . , we show the raman spectra of @xmath24n:@xmath25 and c@xmath26 with natural carbon isotope contents at ambient conditions and excited with a 488 nm laser .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath27n:@xmath25 is identical to that of @xmath25 as the raman technique is not sensitive to the 2000 ppm amounts of @xmath27n .",
    "we focus our attention on the totally symmetric a@xmath28(2 ) mode that appears with the largest intensity for this laser excitation @xcite .",
    "analysis of this mode enables us to determine the @xmath0c enrichment level with precision and provides information on its homogeneity .",
    "a similar analysis was performed previously kendzioraprb1995@xcite . as the @xmath0c build - in in the c@xmath26 s is a random process",
    ", the number of @xmath0c nuclei on a given @xmath9 fullerene is expected to follow a binomial distribution with @xmath29 expectation value .",
    "the vibrational frequency of the @xmath0c enriched fullerenes downshifts as a result of the heavier @xmath0c . in a continuum approximation",
    "the amount of the downshift is given by : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the raman shifts of the corresponding modes in the natural carbon and enriched materials , respectively , @xmath33 is the concentration of the @xmath0c enrichment , and @xmath34 is the natural abundance of @xmath0c in carbon .",
    "the experimentally observed 16.0(5 ) @xmath35 downshift of the first moment of the a@xmath23(2 ) mode , corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , the full line - shape was simulated from the convolution of the binomial distribution with the line - shape of this mode in the natural c@xmath2 . a good agreement between the experimentally observed line - shape and the simulation ( lowest solid curve in fig .",
    "[ ramanspectra ] ) was obtained using the above value for @xmath33 .",
    "this proves that the distribution of the @xmath0c nuclei follows the statistical expectation and is therefore homogeneous .",
    "the current @xmath37 is slightly different from the value , @xmath38 , given by the supplier underlining the difficulty of the @xmath0c content determination .    in order to further characterize the material , we compared its raman spectra with that of the starting fullerene mixture ( not shown ) .",
    "the absence of the c@xmath12 peaks puts a 2 % upper limit on the total amount of residual higher fullerenes in our material as compared to the starting value of about 20 % .",
    "this proves that the double sublimation procedure at 500 @xmath16c is indeed very effective in purifying the material from higher fullerenes .",
    "the @xmath9 phase with @xmath14 that was observed with mass spectroscopy by the supplier is not removed by the double sublimation , however its content is below the detectability limit . in contrast , electron spin resonance spectroscopy can detect the fraction of the sample that belongs to the different @xmath10n radicals .",

    ", we show the room temperature esr spectrum of the @xmath39n@xmath40 material with two different magnetic field scales .",
    "we also show the spectrum of non - enriched c@xmath1n : c@xmath2 for comparison .",
    "the spectra of the latter was analyzed in detail previously @xcite and is recalled here .",
    "the dominating triplet component was identified as due to the @xmath4n ( @xmath41 ) hyperfine interaction .",
    "the free tumbling of the molecule above the _ sc - fcc _ structural transition of the c@xmath42 @xmath43 k @xcite , averages out the anisotropic part of this hyperfine coupling .",
    "however , the electron is delocalized on the c@xmath1n cage and a number of well defined @xmath0c ( @xmath44 ) satellite doublets appear as a result of the finite electron density on the different c positions and the 1.1 % abundance of @xmath0c in carbon .",
    "the hyperfine couplings were determined for eight non - equivalent carbon sites corresponding to twenty - three sites on the c@xmath1n molecule .",
    "an additional small intensity signal between the two low - field @xmath4n triplet lines was identified as a c@xmath1n@xmath45-c@xmath46 heterodimer due to a partial charge transfer from c@xmath1n @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath0c@xmath47)@xmath1n spectrum is simulated for arbitrary @xmath48 by using a recursive build - up technique @xcite . the effect of the first @xmath7c coupling is computed by superimposing a doublet pattern with intensity @xmath48 onto each components of the original nitrogen triplet signal with intensity of @xmath49 . in the next step , this superimposed spectrum is considered as a starting signal and the next superimposition is carried out in the same way by using the next carbon splitting constant .",
    "the new carbon splitting could have the same value as the preceding one in the case of equivalent carbons .",
    "the procedure is repeated for all the 23 carbon nuclei with resolved splitting .",
    "the impact of the 36 non - resolved carbon splittings can be considered by using an increased intrinsic line - width in the primer spectrum .",
    "similarly , the small intensity c@xmath1n@xmath45-c@xmath46 heterodimer signal becomes unobservable due to its broadening .",
    "the esr spectrum of the @xmath50n:@xmath51 consists of apparently two overlapping signals :  a broad component and a triplet signal together with a @xmath0c hyperfine pattern .",
    "the @xmath0c hyperfine structure is similar to that observed in the non - enriched c@xmath1n , however its components have an increased line - width that results from the hyperfine interaction of the non - resolved c sites .",
    "the double integrated and mass normalized intensities , that measures the number of spins in the sample , are similar for the natural and enriched materials suggesting that the complicated pattern in the enriched sample also originates from the c@xmath1n radicals , however , the presence of @xmath0c broadens its spectrum .",
    "below , we show that the observed esr pattern reflects the inhomogeneity in our sample .",
    "the narrow triplet and the broader components originate from the less and highly @xmath0c enriched phases , respectively .",

    "simulated spectra for the two levels of isotope enrichments , @xmath19c@xmath53n:@xmath19c@xmath21 ( c ) and @xmath19c@xmath54n:@xmath19c@xmath21 ( d ) are also shown . ]    in fig .",
    "[ esrdeconv]a .",
    "we show the experimental spectrum again together with a simulation for a sample containing a mixture of @xmath55n molecules with @xmath56 and @xmath57 enrichments ( fig .",
    "[ esrdeconv]b . ) with intensity ratios of 98.2:1.8 , respectively .",
    "g_-factors of the two components were taken to be identical with that of the non - enriched c@xmath1n of @xmath58 .",
    "a residual 0.04 mt line - width was assumed to account for the hyperfine interactions of the non - resolved c sites .",
    "the combination of these spectra was found to simulate best the experimental curve .",
    "it was assumed that the molecules are freely rotating and the spectra can be described using the previously determined hyperfine coupling constants .",
    "the simulated spectra are shown separately for the two types of molecules in fig .",
    "[ esrdeconv]c . and",
    "d. , respectively .",
    "although , the two kinds of molecules have a similar esr amplitude , they have very different integrated intensities .",
    "we recall that the esr signal intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the linewidth due to the field modulation technique employed . as a result ,",
    "the narrow structure is only a tiny , 2 % fraction of the total esr signal intensity .",
    "this small amount of @xmath0c poorer phase is an unwanted side - product of the production of the higher @xmath0c enriched material , however , its amount may not be a limiting factor for practical applications .",
    "in conclusion , we presented the preparation of a @xmath0c enriched heterofullerene , the @xmath0c@xmath1n azafullerene , from @xmath0c enriched fullerenes .",
    "raman and esr spectroscopy was used to characterize the enrichment and its homogeneity .",
    "the material was produced in a nitrogen discharge tube with the same yield as the non - enriched material .",
    "this synthesis method opens new prospects for applications of the chemically active heterofullerenes .",
    "these include nuclear spin - labelling of bio - molecules with heterofullerenes or the nuclear spin labelling of the biologically active fullerene itself such as in the hiv-1 inhibitor fullerene derivatives @xcite .",
