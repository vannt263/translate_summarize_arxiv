    "one of the greatest challenges of contemporary physics is to make sense of the fact that , at solar system level , there is no evidence that an extension of gr is required to account for all observed gravitational phenomena ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent account ) , even though , from the theoretical point of view , gr is not a fully satisfactory theory . indeed , gr exhibits singularities and is incompatible with quantum mechanics ; furthermore , in order to account for the cosmological data , new states such as dark matter and dark energy are required .    as a possible alternative to this standard scenario ,",
    "it is equally plausible that gr is actually an effective version of a more general theory of gravity .",
    "more recently , a great deal of interest has been dedicated to the so - called @xmath0 theories @xcite ; these can be further generalized by considering that matter and curvature are nonminimally coupled @xcite , an idea that gives rise to many interesting features and has spanned several studies : these include the impact on stellar observables @xcite , the so - called energy conditions @xcite , the equivalence with multi - scalar - tensor theories @xcite , the possibility to account for galactic @xcite and cluster @xcite dark matter , cosmological perturbations @xcite , a mechanism for mimicking a cosmological constant at astrophysical scales @xcite , post - inflationary reheating @xcite or the current accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , the dynamical impact of the choice of the lagrangian density of matter @xcite , gravitational collapse @xcite , its newtonian limit @xcite and existence of closed timelike curves @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study whether a nonminimally coupled theory of gravity can be assessed using solar system observables .",
    "it follows an analogous analysis , performed by chiba , smith and erickcek @xcite for generic @xmath0 theories . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors find a set of conditions that , when satisfied by the function @xmath0 , lead to the prediction that the value of the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameter @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 , which is not in agreement with solar system tests of gravity .",
    "hence , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite can be considered as a tool to rule out @xmath0 theories that satisfy a suitable set of conditions .",
    "particularly , it turns out that the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) gravity theory proposed by carroll - duvvuri - trodden - turner @xcite is ruled out by this analysis .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a class of nmc theories of gravity where the action functional of gr is replaced with a more general form involving two functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the ricci scalar curvature @xmath3 .",
    "the function @xmath1 has a role analogous to @xmath0 gravity , and the function @xmath2 yields a nonminimal coupling between the matter lagrangian density @xmath4 and the scalar curvature .",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to develop a general framework for the study of solar system constraints to nmc gravity .",

    "this model posits an inverse power - law nmc @xmath9 term in the action functional , and can be considered as a natural extension of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) gravity to a nonminimally coupled case .",

    "@xcite can not be constrained or excluded by the method developed in this work .",
    "hence such a nmc model remains , in this respect , a viable theory of gravity .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sections ii and iii , we present our model and the assumptions adopted to ascertain the effect of the nmc in the solar system . in sections iv and v , we carry out the suitable linearization of the relevant equations and derive the conditions required for applying the long range limit",
    ". sections vi - viii then address the solutions to the obtained set of equations .",
    "section ix tackles the compatibility of the model under scrutiny with the various assumptions used to assess its impact at solar system scales . finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "an appendix accounts for some technical aspects used to obtain the solution for linearized field equations .",
    "in the present work we consider gravitational theories with an action functional of the form @xcite , @xmath10 \\ll_m \\right]\\sqrt{-g } \\ , d^4x,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are functions of the ricci scalar curvature @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the lagrangian density of matter and @xmath13 is the metric determinant .",
