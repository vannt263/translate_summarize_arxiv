    "m dwarfs are the smallest and least luminous stars on the main sequence , yet they are the most numerous of all stellar constituents and have lifetimes longer than the current age of the universe .",
    "determining the age of an individual main sequence , field m dwarf is quite challenging .",
    "stellar clusters would seem to provide the ideal environments for calibrating the ages of m dwarfs ( because the age of the cluster is determined ) .",
    "however , the large distances to clusters older than a few gyr ( and resulting faintness of cluster m dwarfs ) , preclude any detailed observations of the intermediate or oldest cluster resident m dwarfs",
    ". age estimates for field m dwarfs must therefore rely on a number of techniques that piggyback on other age dating methods .",
    "although several methods exist for estimating the ages of m dwarfs ( e.g. contribution by s. catalan ) , we focus this contribution on what the magnetic activity of m dwarfs can tell us about their age .",
    "m dwarfs are host to intense magnetics dynamos that give rise to chromospheric and coronal heating , producing emission from the x - ray to the radio .",
    "this magnetic activity has long been thought to be tied to the age of the host star .",
    "almost 40 years ago , wilson & woolley ( 1970 ) found a link between magnetic activity ( as traced by the ca ii h & k emission lines ) and the orbital elements ( namely the inclination and eccentricity ) of more than 300 late - type dwarfs ; stars in near - circular orbits with small inclinations had the strongest activity .",
    "they concluded that as stars age , their orbits get more inclined and more eccentric ( due to dynamical interactions ) , and thus , magnetic activity must also decline with age .",
    "subsequent studies over the following decades have found similar connections between age and activity in low - mass stars ( wielen 1977 ; giampapa & liebert 1986 ; soderblom et al .",
    "1991 ; hawley et al .",
    "1996 , hawley et al .",
    "1999 , hawley et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "although activity has been observed for decades , the exact mechanism that gives rise to the chromospheric heating is still not well - understood . in the sun ,",
    "magnetic field generation and subsequent heating is closely tied to the sun s rotation . from helioseismology , we know that there is a rotational boundary between the inner solid - body rotating radiative zone and the outer differentially rotating convective zone ( parker 1993 ; ossendrijver 2003 ; thompson et al .",
    "this boundary , dubbed the tachocline , creates a rotational shear that likely allows magnetic fields to be generated , preserved and eventually rise to the surface where they emerge as magnetic loops .",
    "these loops bring heat to the sun s chromosphere and corona , driving both large stellar flares , as well as lower - level quiescent ( or persistent ) magnetic activity .",
    "the faster a star ( with a tachocline ) rotates , the stronger its magnetic heating and surface activity .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum evolution of solar - type stars should play an important role in determining the magnitude of the observed activity .",
    "angular momentum loss from magnetized winds has been shown to slow rotation in solar - type stars ; as a result magnetic activity decreases .",
    "skumanich ( 1972 ) found that both activity and rotation decrease over time as a power law ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "subsequent studies confirmed the skumanich results and empirically demonstrated a strong link between age , rotation and activity in solar - type stars ( barry 1988 ; soderblom et al .",
    "1991 ; pizzolato et al .",
    "2003 ; mamajek & hillenbrand 2008 ; see contribution by e. mamajek ) .",
    "there is strong evidence that the rotation - activity ( and presumably age ) relation extends from stars more massive than the sun to smaller dwarfs ( pizzolato et al .",
    "2003 ; mohanty & basri 2003 ; kiraga & stepien 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , rotation derived ages ( using gyrochronology ) may provide a useful independent estimate of age for m dwarfs when large enough calibration samples can be acquired ( see contributions by s. meibom , j. irwin , and s. barnes ) . however , at a spectral type of @xmath2m3 ( 0.35 m@xmath3 ; reid & hawley 2005 ; chabrier & baraffe 1997 ) , stars become fully convective and the tachocline presumably disappears . despite this changes ,",
    "magnetic activity persists in late - type m dwarfs ; the fraction of active m dwarfs peaks around a spectral type of m7 before decreasing into the brown dwarf regime ( hawley et al .",
    "1996 ; gizis et al .",
    "2000 ; west et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is unclear if the rotation - age - activity relation extends to the fully convective m dwarfs .",
    "a few empirical studies have uncovered evidence that activity and rotation might be linked in late - type m dwarfs ( delfosse et al .",
    "1998 ; mohanty & basri 2003 ; reiners & basri 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , recent simulations of fully convective stars find that rotation may play a role in magnetic dynamo generation ( dobler et al . 2006 ; browning 2008 ) .",
    "however , a recent study found detectable rotation in a few inactive m7 dwarfs , indicating that the situation may in fact be more complicated ( west & basri 2009 ) .",
    "irrespective of rotation , many studies have found evidence that the age - activity relation extends into the m dwarf regime .",
    "eggen ( 199 ) observed a skumanich - type decrease in activity as a function of age .",
    "larger samples of m dwarfs have added further evidence that magnetic activity decreases with age ( fleming et al . 1995 ; gizis et al .",
    "there is also evidence that m dwarfs may have finite active lifetimes .",
    "stauffer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggested that activity may not be present in the most massive m dwarfs in the pleiades .",
    "hawley et al . ( 2000 ) confirmed the stauffer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) claim by observing a a sample of clusters that spanned several gyr in age .",
    "they were able to calibrate the lifetimes for early - type m dwarfs by observing the color at which activity ( traced by h@xmath0 emission ) was no longer present . because of the small sample size , the derived hawley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) activity ages are lower limits at a given color or spectral type .",
    "as mentioned above , the hawley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) study was limited to younger , nearby clusters due to the intrinsic faintness of m dwarfs ; thus , it could only probe ages of a few gyr and spectral types as late as @xmath2m3 . larger samples of m dwarfs are required to statistically derive age - activity relations that extend both in the ages they probe and the range of spectral types they cover .    in this contribution , we review recent studies that have used large spectroscopic samples to investigate the relationship between age and activity in m dwarfs . in addition , we derive a statistical h@xmath0 age - activity relation for m2-m7 dwarfs .",
    "large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) have created optical and infrared catalogs of tens of millions of m dwarfs ( bochanski et al .",
    "2009 in prep ) .",
    "in addition to the photometric data , the sdss has obtained spectra for tens of thousands of m dwarfs . recently , these surveys have been utilized to examine the statistical properties of m dwarfs , the dynamics of the milky way and detailed studies of magnetic activity ( hawley et al .",

    "2008 ; hereafter w08 ) .",
    "recently , the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) low - mass star spectroscopic sample was released ( w08 ) , containing over 44000 m and early l - type dwarfs .",
    "radial velocities ( accurate to within @xmath25 km s@xmath4 ) and photometric distances ( from the @xmath5 colors ; see bochanski et al .",
    "2009 in prep ) were measured for all of the stars .",
    "proper motions ( matches to usno - b ; munn et al .",
    "2004 ) were obtained for over 27000 of the stars , allowing for full @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 3-d space motions for over 27000 low - mass dwarfs , the largest such sample ever assembled .",
    "in addition , all of the spectra were run through the hammer spectral typing facility ( covey et al .",
    "2007 ) to assign spectral types and measure the strength of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "one of the hallmarks of the w08 sample is that it probes the entirety of the galactic thin disk and extends well into the thick disk ( @xmath250 - 2500 pc above the plane ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the majority of sdss fields are in the north galactic cap and that sdss was designed to study the distant universe ; intrinsically faint galactic m dwarfs are bright in a deep extragalactic survey .",
    "activity in m dwarfs varies as a function of spectral type .",
    "figure [ frac ] shows the fraction of active m dwarfs as a function of spectral type from west et al .",
    "the active fraction is very small for early - type m dwarfs , peaks at m7-m8 and declines into the l dwarf regime .",
    "while some of the morphology of this relation may be due to the ability ( or inability ) to host a strong dynamo ( the activity fraction decrease in the late - type m and l dwarfs is likely caused by the atmospheres becoming neutral ) , a large part of the shape may be due to age effects .",
    "if activity has a finite lifetime that changes as a function of spectral type , and we observe a range of stellar ages , then stars with longer lifetimes will appear to have higher activity fractions .        to test this hypothesis , west et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) showed that the fraction of active m7 stars decreases as a function of vertical distance from the galactic plane ( see figure [ falloff ] ) .",
    "stars are born in dynamically cold molecular gas near the midplane of the galaxy . over time",
    "they undergo dynamical interactions with molecular clouds , which add energy to the stellar orbits in all dimensions ( see contribution by b. nordstrm ) .",
    "it is this process that gives thickness to the milky way disk and allows us to use vertical distance as a proxy for age ; stars further from the plane are statistically older ( they have to be dynamically heated to reach those heights ) , while stars near the plane are statistically younger .",
    "figure [ falloff ] shows that the younger stars , near the plane of the milky way are almost all active , whereas the fraction of active stars at larger distances above ( and below ) the galaxy is significantly reduced ; older stars have ceased being active .",
    "the decrease of active fractions as a function of vertical height above the plane is seen for all m dwarf spectral types ( w08 ) .",
    "w08 also showed that the amount of activity , quantified by @xmath9/@xmath10 ( the ratio of the luminosity in the h@xmath0 emission line to the bolometric flux of the star ) decreases over time .",
