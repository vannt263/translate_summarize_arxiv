    "a special property of the class is that any np - complete problem can be converted into any other np - complete problem in polynomial time on a classical computer ; therefore , it is sufficient to find a deterministic algorithm that can be guaranteed to solve all instances of just one of the np - complete problems within a polynomial time bound .",

    "a particular choice of the coefficients is @xcite @xmath21 the total hamiltonian ( [ farhi ] ) produces a nontrivial quantum evolution from some initial ( superposition ) state @xmath22 to a final ( solution ) state @xmath23 .",
    "if no knowledge about the solution is available _ a priori _ , then the initial state may be chosen as the symmetric state ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath24this choice is appropriate provided ( [ ini ] ) is a ground state of @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "now , if @xmath12 is sufficiently large , then functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 vary in time slowly and the system will remain in the instantaneous ( adiabatic ) ground state of @xmath28 during its entire evolution @xmath29 ( cf .",

    "it is clear that in this case a measurement performed on the quantum register at @xmath32 will find with certainty one of the solutions of cop . in this case",

    "if we expand the wavefunction of the system @xmath33 in the basis of the adiabatic eigenfunctions @xmath34 of the hamiltonian @xmath28 @xmath35 then adiabatic approximation corresponds to @xmath36 ( up to the oscillating phase factor ) .",

    "it is seen that during the quantum evolution coefficients @xmath43 and the largest admixture of the exited states into the total superposition occurs at the instant of time when one of the exited levels @xmath44 closely approaches the ground state ( avoided - crossing ) . from here",
    "the overall criterion for the adiabatic evolution can be expressed in the well - known form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the closest approach of the ground state to one of the excited states during the evolution - a minimum gap- and @xmath47 is the characteristic energy scale for the matrix elements of @xmath15 .",
    "we note that although instantaneous nonadiabatic corrections ( [ nonad ] ) are quadratic in the parameter @xmath48 ( near the avoided crossing ) the probability of nonadiabatic transitions @xmath49 away from the ground state is exponentially small in @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "the exponent is approximately of the order of the parameter @xmath48 in ( [ criterion ] ) , and therefore it is the size of the minimum gap @xmath46 that determines the condition for _ t _ and hence the complexity of the quantum adiabatic search algorithm according to @xcite .",
    "we note finally that , as pointed out in @xcite , the improved complexity of the adiabatic algorithm is determined by the instantaneous rate @xmath54 of the variation of the control parameter @xmath55 near the avoided crossing",
    ". we will not discuss in this paper such modifications and focus primarily on intrinsic properties of the quantum system in question .",
    "in this paper , we will analyze the complexity of the adiabatic quantum optimization for the _ set partition problem _ ( spp ) , which is one of the basic np - complete problems of theoretical computer science @xcite .",
    "the optimization version of spp is to partition a set of @xmath0 positive integers @xmath56 into two disjoint subsets @xmath57 and @xmath58 such that the `` residue '' @xmath59 is minimized .",
    "the complexity of the problem substantially depends on the size of the integers @xmath60 ( see below ) .",
    "it is often customary for the analysis of the random instances of the problem to introduce finite - precision rational numbers @xmath61 that are independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) in the unit interval @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "@xmath63\\ ] ] here @xmath64 is the total number of bits used to represent the numbers @xmath61 .",
    "the values of the partition can be encoded in binaries by attaching `` sign '' bits @xmath65 to the numbers @xmath61 .",
    "the partition residue can be defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 here @xmath68 is a _ signed _ partition residue .",
    "we note that by definition the problem is symmetric : two bit strings that can be obtained from each other by flipping all the bits ( @xmath69 ) correspond to two values of @xmath68 that differ only in sign .",
    "we note that the minimum - residue partition(s ) may be thought of as the ground state(s ) of the following spin hamiltonian @xcite @xmath70 this is an infinite range ising spin glass with mattis type antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath71 .",
    "infinite range coupling clearly represents a major problem with direct ( ` analog ' ) physical implementation of this hamiltonian on a quantum computer .",
    "therefore one can consider using an oracle - type cost function @xmath72 to implement the problem hamiltonian in ( [ farhi ] ) for spp .",
    "the corresponding unitary transformation will multiply the basis states @xmath30 by phase factors @xmath73 during the elementary discrete steps of the ` continuous - time ' adabatic quantum optimization ( [ farhi ] ) .",
    "although this approach is natural for the satisfiability problem @xcite it has a serious limitation for spp ( as well as some other np - complete problems like integer programming , where the precision of integers is of central importance ) . to demonstrate this point we need to consider the density of states of the partition residues .",
    "we define the density of states for a given instance of spp as follows @xmath74 the exact form of @xmath75 depends on a given instance of spp ( i.e. , a particular set of numbers @xmath61 ) .",
    "however we introduce a _ coarse - grained _ density of states @xmath76 where averaging is over an interval of @xmath77 whose size will be determined below . using ( [ omega ] ) and",
    "( [ density ] ) we can rewrite this expression in the form @xmath78 note that @xmath79 and @xmath80 has very sharp maxima ( minima ) at those points . in their vicinities the integral in ( [ cos ] ) can be evaluated by steepest descent method for any given problem instance .",
    "the sum over the contributions from different saddle points was obtained by mertens @xcite in his derivation of the partition function for the corresponding spin glass model .",
    "we emphasize however that @xmath80 can have multiple sharp resonances at the intermediate points @xmath81 .",
    "the positions of these resonances are at the multiples of @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an _ approximate _ greatest common divisor ( g.c.d . ) of the set of @xmath0 numbers @xmath61 such that @xmath84 where @xmath85 are integers and @xmath86 are residues of the division . provided that most of the residues are sufficiently small @xmath87 the function @xmath80 will have steep peaks at those points .",
    "it can be shown that in the general case the value of the approximate g.c.d . for a set of @xmath0 @xmath88 numbers inside",
    "the unit interval scales as @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "obviously it equals @xmath91 for @xmath92 . in",
    "what follows we will be interested in the high - precision case @xmath90 .",
    "we choose the size of the averaging window @xmath93 and this introduces a cut - off in the integral ( [ cost0 ] ) at @xmath94 it follows from above that in this case the values of the g.c.d",
    ". will lie outside the cutoff and corresponding resonances will not contribute to the integral .",
    "the value of the integral can be estimated near the single remaining maximum at @xmath95 .",
    "the width of the maximum near that point is   @xmath96 and therefore the window function in ( [ omega ] ) works as a step function in that region .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath97 here the variance @xmath98 is a `` self - averaging '' quantity , and the coarse - graining is performed over an interval much larger than the characteristic separation between neighboring partition residue values @xmath99 yet much smaller than the scale of variation of @xmath100 : @xmath101 .",
    "we note that in the high - precision regime ( @xmath102 ) , partition residues @xmath68 are irregularly spaced and well separated from each other ( on the scale of @xmath91 ) .",
    "however this structure is being averaged out in ( [ density1 ] ) and the result indicates that , in general , no more structure exists on a scale @xmath103 other than that given by the gaussian distribution in ( [ density1 ] ) .",
    "we note that this distribution is usually obtained for the spp using averaging over different instances of the problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite(_b _ ) ) ; here we recovered it as a coarse - grained distribution for a _ given _ instance which is more consistent with our goal of studying the complexity of the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm @xcite .",
    "computational complexity of spp depends critically on the number of bits @xmath64 : numerical simulations with independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random @xmath64-bit numbers @xmath61 show @xcite that the solution time grows exponentially with @xmath0 for @xmath104 ( high - precision , computationally ` hard phase ' ) , and polynomially for @xmath105 ( low - precision , computationally ` easy phase ' ) , exhibiting a behavior similar to a phase transition @xcite(_a _ ) .    in the low - precision phase , values of @xmath68 are equally spaced ( in @xmath91 ) and strongly degenerate each corresponding to ( roughly ) @xmath106 number of bit - strings .",
    "this degeneracy grows exponentially with",
    "n if @xmath64 remains fixed .",
    "the total number of solutions with zero residues accumulate correspondingly and this is why the complexity eventually becomes polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "the quantum algorithm suggested in @xcite directly computes the density of states ( [ density ] ) of the spp and is efficient in finding the number of solutions in the low - precision case . in this case",
    "it is also feasible to use a cost function @xmath72 ( provided the number of possible values does not grow exponentially with @xmath0 ) .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different in the high - precision case .",
    "implementation of the approach based on the above cost function will require a quantum computer using exponentially high precision physical parameters ( external fields , etc ) to control small differences _ in the phases _ of unitary transformations on the scale at least @xmath107 .",
    "this is a technical difference from the constraint satisfaction problem in which the cost function generally takes only the set of values that scales polynomially with @xmath0 ; the size of the set equals the total number of constraints @xmath108 ( the computationally most difficult case corresponds to @xmath109 and the case of @xmath110 is not of general interest there ) . to avoid the above restriction in the implementation of the adabatic quantum optimization algorithm for spp",
    ", we introduce a cost function @xmath111 based on a logarithmic scale of the partition residue values : @xmath112 since the density of states is linear at @xmath113 number of states @xmath114 per energy level @xmath115 will grow exponentially with @xmath116 in that range ( @xmath117 ) . the total number of levels @xmath118 depends on the value of @xmath119 . using the density of states ( [ density1 ] ) for @xmath120",
    "one can set @xmath121 where @xmath122 is some fixed number ( a few dozen ) independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the number of ground states of the problem hamiltonian @xmath123 approximately equals @xmath122 , and the total number of energy levels @xmath118 is close to @xmath0 .",
    "it can be estimated from ( [ cost2 ] ) that @xmath124 .",
    "the distribution of the low - lying states @xmath114 with cost function ( [ cost2 ] ) is somewhat similar to that in the slightly underconstrained cases of the satisfiability problem .",
    "to study the complexity of the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm for spp , we numerically integrate the time dependent schr \" odinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath28 ( [ farhi ] ) , ( [ driver ] ) in which we set @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we start from the symmetric initial state ( [ ini ] ) and integrate the schr \" odinger equation in the interval @xmath127 . unlike the approach adopted in @xcite we do not set _ a - priori _ a value of success probability .",
    "instead we introduce a complexity metric for the algorithm @xmath128 here @xmath129 is the total probability of finding the system in its ground level ( with @xmath130 ) at the end of the algorithm , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is the number of states at the ground level .",
    "the algorithm has to be repeated on average @xmath133 number of times to reach success probability @xmath134 1 . a typical plot of @xmath135 for an instance of spp with @xmath0=15 numbers is shown in fig .",

    "very small @xmath12 the wavefunction is close to the symmetric initial state and the complexity is @xmath136 .",

    "the results indicate that the median value of complexity @xmath140 scales _ exponentially _ with @xmath0 ; linear fit to the graph gives @xmath141 .",

    "the exponential behavior of the algorithm clearly manifests itself for the larger values of @xmath143 11 .",
    "the scatter in the values of @xmath144 appears to decreases with @xmath0 however this result is probably due to the smaller number of data points available for larger @xmath0 values .    in fig .",

    "the close approach of these eigenvalues is not relevant for the minimum - gap analysis since they all end up in the same final level .",
    "however the minimum separation of the instantaneous adiabatic ground state eigenvalue from the excited state eigenvalues that _ do not _ end up on the same ground level at @xmath154 is clearly seen in the figures .",
    "note that the size of this separation is much greater than the separations between the excited states .",
    "this behavior clearly departs from the standard 2-level avoided crossing picture and is due to the contributions from the exponential number of terms in ( [ nonad ] ) as will be analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
