    "environment induced decoherence , describing the transition from the quantum to the classical world , has been elaborately studied in the past decade ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "such a phenomenon is considered both a major obstacle in quantum information processing , and an ally in understanding the mechanisms underlying the quantum to classical transition @xcite . generally , the unavoidable interaction of quantum systems with their environments is responsible for the transformation of a quantum state into a classical one . such a process is faster and faster the more macroscopic the initial state is @xcite .",
    "the details of the dynamics of the decoherence process depend , among other things , on the structure of the environment @xcite .",
    "we study a quantum harmonic oscillator weakly coupled to a bosonic thermal bath .",
    "this model is one of the few ones , in the theory of open quantum systems , that is amenable to an exact solution @xcite .",
    "the system is a quantum harmonic oscillator , and therefore can be prepared in both highly quantum states , such as fock states and schrdinger cat states , and semiclassical states such as coherent states and thermal states .",
    "hence , it is very suitable for studying decoherence and loss of nonclassicality .",
    "the dynamics of the reduced system obey the exact time - local hu - paz - zhang master equation @xcite .",
    "the existence of an exact analytical solution of the hu - paz - zhang master equation @xcite enables us to investigate the non - markovian dynamics of the system . since decoherence is a very rapid process the non - markovian dynamics often play a crucial role .",
    "moreover , the analytic non - markovian solution is a key ingredient in the development of zeno - control strategies since it makes it possible to trace back the origin of zeno or anti - zeno dynamics to the form of the reservoir spectrum",
    ".    environment induced decoherence in quantum brownian motion has been studied extensively in the past decades @xcite .",
    "some studies consider also the effect different environments have on decoherence , focussing in particular on those cases in which the markovian approximation , neglecting system - reservoir correlations , holds @xcite .",
    "the study of the influence of different environments on the open system dynamics , and in particular on the decoherence and loss of nonclassicality , is particularly timely .",
    "experiments dealing with more and more complicated engineered reservoirs , from optical and microwave cavities @xcite to photonic crystals @xcite , from controllable ohmic environments @xcite to sub - ohmic and super - ohmic reservoirs @xcite , are becoming , indeed , more and more accurate .",
    "the ability to modify in a controlled way the coherence properties of the system by acting on its environment , and in particular by modifying its spectral properties , necessitates , however , non - markovian theoretical approaches since structured reservoirs are characterized by non - negligible memory effects .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the quantum to classical transition can be modified by reservoir engineering for an initial schrdinger cat state , and by nonselective energy measurements in the case of an initial fock state . in the former case",
    "we compare three different ohmic - like reservoirs and find out which one induces the slowest decoherence . in the latter case we show that the measurements may either slow down the quantum to classical transition , i.e. , quantum zeno effect , or speed up the transition , i.e. , anti - zeno effect ( see @xcite and references therein for a review on qze and aze ) .",
    "quantum zeno phenomena have been mostly studied using a two - level system model . in connection to quantum measurement theory",
    "the qze was also discussed for a more complicated system and for different types of reservoirs in ref .",
    "recently the description of qze and aze for the damped quantum harmonic oscillator has been given in the ohmic reservoir case @xcite .",
    "here we generalize these results to the sub - ohmic and super - ohmic environment and bring to light the extreme sensitivity of these quantum phenomena to the form of the environment .",

    "since we are interested in the non - markovian dynamics occurring at time scales @xmath49 , we can use the secular master equation when @xmath47 , since in this case the secular approximation holds in the non - markovian time scales . for @xmath48 ,",
    "on the other hand , the secular approximation can not be performed at short times @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , in this latter case , we must use the master equation .",
    "in the following section we will define the tool used to characterize decoherence of a schrdinger cat state , namely the fringe visibility function , we will present the analytic solutions of both master equations and and we will examine how decoherence occurs , within these two parameter regimes , for different engineered reservoirs .",

    "the interference term signals the quantumness of the superposition and it is absent for classical statistical mixtures .",
    "the disappearance of the interference term is thus considered a mark of the quantum to classical transition .    to follow the dynamics of the decoherence process , it is convenient to look at the fringe visibility function @xcite @xmath58^{1/2}}\\label{fringevis},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the value of the wigner function at @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the values of the wigner function at @xmath62 , respectively .",

    "this means that the heating process , in the @xmath48 case , can be seen as due to an effective reservoir at a temperature @xmath71 .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that , in the resonant regime we do not neglect the counter rotating terms in eq . .",
    "these terms provide two additional channels for the energy exchange between the system and the environment .",
    "this is consistent with what was found for the heating function in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the fringe visibility for the ohmic , sub - ohmic and super - ohmic reservoirs is shown in figs . 2 and 3 , for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . the initial non - markovian quadratic behavior ,",
    "as opposed to the exponential one typical of flat markovian reservoirs , is clearly visible . as an example we have plotted the markovian versus non - markovian fringe visibilities in the insets of figs . 2 and 3 for the ohmic reservoir and for short initial times .",
    "we note that in the off - resonant case , see fig .",
    "2 , the markovian fringe visibility decays slower than the non - markovian one .",
    "this is due to the initial jolt in @xmath15 causing a faster decoherence for @xmath63 . on the contrary , in the resonant case ,",
    "3 , the markovian decay of the fringe visibility is faster than the non - markovian one . in the latter case , indeed ,",
    "@xmath74 , hence the initial non - markovian decoherence is slower .",
    "the other reservoirs show similar behavior in the markovian vs non - markovian initial dynamics .",
    "the time evolution of the fringe visibility factor shows a similar qualitative behavior for all three reservoir types ( ohmic , sub - ohmic and super - ohmic ) , both in the resonant and in the off - resonant regime .",
    "this is in contrast with the dynamics of the heating function where non - markovian oscillations , indicating an exchange of energy between the system and the environment , characterize the @xmath75 regime , for all types of reservoirs @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the decoherence process is significantly faster for @xmath48 than for @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , in the former case the effective coupling of the system to the reservoir is stronger than in the off - resonant case , due to the overlap between the frequency of the system oscillator and the reservoir spectrum .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath48 case the system interacts with the engineered reservoir via two effective channels , due to the non - negligible effect of the counter - rotating terms , as explained in the previous subsection .",
    "the ohmic reservoir induces the slowest decoherence , while the super - ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs decay in a very similar manner , both faster than the ohmic case .",
    "therefore , if one is able to modify the natural reservoir spectrum into an ohmic form , one would slow down decoherence with respect to the sub - ohmic and super - ohmic ones , and in the case of @xmath43 also with respect to the corresponding markovian reservoir .",
    "note that , for @xmath19 , the exponential factors in eqs .",
    "( [ fringevis01 ] ) and ( [ fringevis10 ] ) can be approximated to one .",
    "this tells us that decoherence depends essentially only on the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 through the heating function @xmath70 .",
    "the interaction with the reservoir causes both decoherence and heating / dissipation .",
    "for the system studied in this paper , and for @xmath19 , these two processes are both characterized by the same coefficient @xmath15 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that , in the decoherence time scale , the heating of the system is very small .",
    "therefore , there exists a clear distinction between the decoherence and heating time scales .",
    "however one can see , e.g. , in the @xmath43 case , that the heating induced by an ohmic reservoir is much slower , than the one caused by a super - ohmic or sub - ohmic reservoir .",
    "this fact also justifies the slowest decoherence experienced by the system in the ohmic case , as shown in fig .",

    "it is known that the decay of an unstable system can be altered by making frequent measurements on the system @xcite . for",
    "the quantum brownian motion case here studied , it has been shown that , in the ohmic case , nonselective energy measurements performed in the short non - markovian timescale may either inhibit or enhance the quantum to classical transition , as a consequence of the quantum zeno or anti - zeno effect , respectively @xcite .",
    "in this section we aim at exploring the crossover between zeno and anti - zeno dynamics for the three different reservoirs introduced in sec .",
    "[ reservoir ] . elucidating",
    "the role played by the reservoir spectrum in the occurrence of the zeno or anti - zeno effect is important due to the fact that different physical realizations of , e.g. , a qubit have different reservoir spectra .",
    "for example , it is known that solid state qubits are subjected to sub - ohmic noise ( @xmath76 noise ) while optical qubits normally interact with an almost flat markovian spectrum .",
    "as we will see in the following , the crossover between zeno and anti - zeno dynamics is extremely sensitive to the details of the spectrum , especially in the super - ohmic case .",
    "moreover , contrarily to the decoherence control strategy based on reservoir engineering presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : reseng ] , in the case of measurement - based control different reservoir spectra lead to very different dynamics .",
    "we consider an initial fock state @xmath77 .",
    "we assume to perform @xmath78 non - selective energy measurements at time intervals @xmath79 such that @xmath80 .",
    "the survival probability , i.e. , the probability that the system is still in its initial state @xmath77 at time @xmath81 is then given by @xcite @xmath82.\\ ] ] here @xmath83 is the effective decay rate . at high temperatures",
    "this rate is given by @xmath84 and it is independent of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "let us denote with @xmath85 the decay rate of the survival probability in the absence of measurements .",
    "this quantity corresponds to the limit @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 with @xmath29 given by eq . .",
    "we note that both @xmath88 and @xmath85 depend on the reservoir spectrum .",
    "the crossover between zeno and anti - zeno dynamics is given by @xcite @xmath89 if a finite time @xmath90 such that @xmath91 exists , then , for times @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 , i.e. , the decay in presence of measurements is slower than the markovian decay in absence of measurements ( qze ) . on the other hand , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and an acceleration of the decay due to",
    "the measurements occurs ( aze ) .    in fig .",
    "4 we show a contour plot of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qze - aze ] ) , for the three different reservoirs under consideration , as a function of the parameter @xmath96 and of the interval between the measurements @xmath97 .",
    "the qze / aze -crossover is indicated by a bold solid contour line .",
    "note that the time @xmath90 identifying the crossover strongly depends on @xmath96 .",
    "in particular , both in the super - ohmic and in the ohmic case , for some value of @xmath96 , only the qze occurs , and the time @xmath90 does not exist .",
    "this is in contrast with the aze - dominated dynamics of radiative decay described in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , for both the super - ohmic and the ohmic spectra ,",
    "there exist also values of @xmath96 in correspondence of which two @xmath90 exist , as , e.g. , the value @xmath98 in the super - ohmic case . for",
    "this value of @xmath96 one can see from fig .",
    "4 that , increasing @xmath79 , one passes from zeno to anti - zeno dynamics and then again to zeno dynamics .    for the ohmic reservoir",
    "the aze occurs only for @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , for ohmic environments with @xmath100 , measurements can only prolong the life of quantum states as the initial fock state here considered . for the sub - ohmic reservoir ,",
    "on the other hand , there exists always a cross - over between zeno and anti - zeno dynamics , for any value of the resonance parameter @xmath96 .",
    "in particular , by increasing the measurement interval @xmath79 one passes from a situation in which decoherence is slowed down to a situation in which it is enhanced .",
    "the super - ohmic reservoir presents some additional interesting features .",
    "the dynamics is mostly anti - zeno dominated , except , of course , for very small values of @xmath79 .",
    "the two aze regions are disconnected by a narrow band of qze region between @xmath101 .",
    "this situation indicates that , for a given super - ohmic spectrum , two system oscillators with slightly different frequencies @xmath102 ( correspondent , e.g. , to @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) may act , in presence of measurements , in completely opposite ways , one showing mostly aze ( @xmath104 ) and the other one only qze ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the occurrence of this type of behavior gives a clear indication of the sensitive role played by the system and reservoir parameters .",
    "a common feature shared by all the reservoirs is that , for @xmath72 , nonselective energy measurements always accelerate decoherence .",
    "the reason lies in the initial jolt of the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 , which causes an initial decoherence much stronger than in the markovian case @xcite .",
    "the off - resonant regime is also characterized by strong non - markovian features such as oscillations and regions of negativity in the diffusion and dissipation coefficients .",
    "however , the aze occurs also when the time - dependent coefficients are positive , e.g. , in the super - ohmic case for @xmath100 .",
    "also in this case an initial jolt is present in @xmath15 ( see fig . 4.1 in ref .",
    "in this paper we have compared two different strategies for controlling environment - induced decoherence for a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a high-@xmath27 bosonic bath .",
    "the first strategy is based on reservoir engineering , a new technique that has been demonstrated recently in many physical context , e.g. , in trapped ion systems @xcite .",
    "we have seen that an initial schrdinger cat state is transformed in the corresponding statistical mixture more slowly in an ohmic engineered reservoir than in a super - ohmic or sub - ohmic reservoir .",
    "it is worth noticing that the quantum to classical transition indicated by the disappearance of the interference fringes in the wigner function never presents strongly non - markovian features , such as oscillations , when the time - dependent coefficients oscillate attaining negative values .",
    "this behavior is different from the case of a two state system in a coherent superposition of two orthogonal states .",
    "for a two state system , indeed , the non - markovian quantum jumps approach shows that the occurrence of temporarily negative decay rates can be interpreted in terms of reverse quantum jumps restoring the quantum superposition destroyed by a previously occurred quantum jump @xcite .",
    "this situation never occurs for the schrdinger cat dynamics here considered .",
    "indeed , even in the @xmath72 regime , the coherence between the two coherent states forming the superposition is never partly restored .",
    "the second technique for controlling decoherence is based on the qze and aze .",
    "we study how sensitive these effects are to the form of the natural reservoir spectrum .",
    "our results on the crossover between the qze and the aze show that some types of environment are more sensitive than others to the reservoir parameters .",
    "the super - ohmic reservoir , for example , shows a remarkable sensitivity to the value of the parameter @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , slight changes in @xmath96 may give rise , for the same value of @xmath79 , to either the qze or the aze .    the quantum zeno effect",
    "is known to be closely connected to decoherence control methods @xcite .",
    "the very rich variety of zeno and anti - zeno dynamics for this system makes it extremely interesting for testing fundamental features of quantum physics such as the possibility of controlling the quantum to classical transition by means of energy measurements @xcite . in view of the astonishing advances in both the coherent manipulation of single quantum systems and the reservoir engineering techniques , we believe that this phenomenon will be soon in the grasp of the experimentalists .",
