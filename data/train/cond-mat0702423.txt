    "new physics often emerges in confined systems when reduced dimensionality leads to new symmetries that , together with the confinement , result in new interesting phenomena .",
    "microcavities in two - dimensional photonic crystals ( 2d phcs ) are an important example of actual confining structures .",
    "they are used for localization of photons into phc bandgaps ( bgs ) in order to build ultra - small , low - loss , low - power and low - threshold lasers and light - emitting structures @xcite . in recent years an important amount of research , both fundamental and applied , has been focused on phcs microcavities with hexagonal shape fabricated in semiconductor slabs perforated with holes , see , e.g. , @xcite , the vertical emission and lasing from which have been successfully demonstrated @xcite . in such microcavities , light waves having frequencies inside the photonic bandgap are trapped and develop confined photon modes , some of them can be considered as circulating around the perimeter of the cavity due to multiple total internal reflections at its boundary ( whispering gallery - type modes)@xcite . vertical emission and lasing from such microcavities",
    "can be achieved by the coupling of the confined phonon modes ( with te polarization ) to the vacuum states .",
    "similar `` vertically emitting '' 2d systems are also realized in live nature , for example in fluorescent butterfly wing scales @xcite .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of the confined photon modes are among most important characteristics of a microcavity : they determine the energies of photons having maximal spontaneous emission probabilities ( the purcell effect ) . in this work we present both theoretical and experimental arguments in favor of the existence of two degenerate photon eigenmodes with @xmath0 @xmath1 in hexagonal microcavities . a semiclassical plane - wave model , which takes into consideration electrodynamic properties of quasi-2d planar photonic microcavity , is developed to predict the eigenfrequencies of the confined photon modes as a function both of the hexagon - cavity size and film thickness .",
    "we show that the eigenfrequencies of the triangular - symmetry modes determine spectral positions of spontaneous emission peaks , which were recently observed in photoluminescence spectra from microcavities in a 2d phc in iii - v semiconductor slabs [ ] . here ,",
    "a new set of microcavities has been built and characterized .",
    "as in ref .",
    "[ ] , by accurate changing the phc film thickness the wavelengths of the phc microcavity eigenmodes are tuned in order of tens of nanometers toward higher energies .",
    "a comparison of the observed eigenmodes with the spectral positions predicted by the models of the modes with triangular symmetry and hexagonal symmetry has also been performed . from that comparison",
    "we conclude that the proposed model of triangular - symmetry modes gives better agreement with the experiment than that based on hexagonal - symmetry modes .",
    "therefore we expect that the proposed model of triangular - symmetry modes will be useful both in understanding the physical origin and for the quantitative prediction of the spontaneous emission peaks in 2d phc microcavities in the form of ideal and distorted hexagons .",
    "experimentally , several 2d phc structures with a hexagonal lattice of circular air holes have been fabricated in an ingaasp semiconductor film incorporating an active medium composed of three in@xmath2ga@xmath3as quantum wells .",
    "this structure gives rise to strong photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra centered around 1500 nm at room temperature .",
    "processing of the phc structures was done by electron - beam lithography of a poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) layer on top of a sio@xmath4 layer ( 120 nm thick ) @xcite . to provide the membranes with sufficiently strong mechanical support , the fabricated layers were bonded to a thin borosilicate glass ( @xmath5 ) with optical glue ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "circular holes were made in the ingaasp membrane by reactive ion beam etching .",
    "a 2d hexagonal phc array with lattice constant @xmath7 500 nm surrounds hexagonal microcavities with a variable number of missing holes per side . here , h3 ( three missing holes per side ) and h5 ( three missing holes per side ) microcavities are fabricated and characterized .",
    "figure [ figh5 ] shows a scanning electron microscopy image of one h5 microcavity and a descriptive drawing of the fabricated structure .",
    "different values of the radius of the holes @xmath8 around 0.33@xmath9 have been used .",
    "the variation of the radius @xmath8 is estimated from the scanning electron microscopy pictures , being below 5% . with this choice of parameters",
    ", a large band gap exists for the te mode between the normalized frequencies of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which corresponds to the wavelength range of 1250 - 1600 nm .",
    "the fabricated structures are optically pumped with a 780 nm laser diode .",
    "an objective lens ( 0.40 na ) is used to focus the excitation spot .",
    "the size of the excitation spot was around 3.5 @xmath12 m which is small enough to fit inside the pc structures and to generate cavity modes .",
    "light is collected by a lens inside a 0.22 m monochromator with a cooled ingaas photodiode connected to a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the resolution of the experimental setup in this configuration is around 2.5 nm .",
    "now we turn to the description of our model . figure [ fig2](a ) shows the hexagonal cavity and the ray paths , which belong to the two degenerate triangular - symmetry modes . within the semiclassical plane - wave model ,",
    "the dispersion equation for the degenerate triangular - symmetry photon modes , confined in an ideal hexagonal microcavity in 2d phc , can be obtained from the requirement that the total phase shift of the wave along its closed path is an integer multiple of @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is integer `` quantum '' wavenumber , @xmath16 takes into account the additional phase shift that occurs during the total internal reflection of the confined photon mode in the 2d phc bandgap frequency region , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the wave velocity and the @xmath19-@xmath20 wave - vector inside the cavity .",
    "it will be shown below that the corresponding wavenumbers @xmath15 in the considered h3 and h5 microcavities are rather large , @xmath21 , which justifies the use of the semiclassical plane - wave model in resolving the eigenfrequencies .",
    "we assume that in ( or close to ) the middle of the phc bandgap the additional phase shift @xmath16 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is equal to the keller additional phase shift due to leakage of ( electron ) wavefunction into classically forbidden regions , @xmath22 , see refs .",
    "[ ] . in the middle of the phc bg , the phase shift @xmath23 does not depend on the exact form and steepness of the effective confining potential , is independent of wavenumber @xmath15 and depends only on the number of turning points ( equal to 3 or 6 for the triangular- or hexagonal - symmetry modes , respectively , see figs . [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we assume that in the middle of the bg the additional phase shift @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is fixed and does not explicitly depend on the phase of the coefficient of the total internal reflection of the confined photon modes , in contrast to the similar to eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) semiclassical plane - wave model which was applied to the total - internal - reflection dielectric microresonators with hexagonal cross section , see ref .",
    "the point is that the phase of the coefficient of the total internal reflection is different ( and the difference is equal to @xmath24 ) for the reflection coefficients of the @xmath25 or @xmath26 fields , which results in different signs of the normal component of the pointing vector , @xmath27 , for the incident and reflected electromagnetic waves , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] . therefore with our choice of @xmath16 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the wavenumber @xmath15 is uniquely defined , as in the case of semiclassical bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition for the bound electron motion . if we apply the same model to the hexagonal - symmetry photon mode , confined in 2d phc hexagonal microcavity ( in the middle of the phc bg ) , see fig .",

    "( 1 ) and r.h.s . of eq . ( 2 ) should be replaced , respectively , by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath22 .",
    "the degeneracy of the two triangular - symmetry modes in an ideal hexagonal microcavity can be removed in a `` distorted hexagon '' , which is bound by two regular triangles with different sides ( see fig . [",
    "fig2](c ) ) . in this case the total optical paths and correspondingly the eigenfrequencies of the two modes , bound inside the different triangles , will be different .",
    "the cavity eigenfrequencies @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are determined by the effective refractive index of the system @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 is determined in turn by electrodynamic properties of quasi-2d planar photonic microcavity .",
    "the approach of the effective refractive index allows us to describe the actual 3d system as an effective 2d system , see also ref .",
    "the @xmath33 depends on the polarization of the confined photon mode ( te or tm ) , and on the relative film thickness @xmath34 of the quasi-2d planar structure .",

    "the dispersion equation for the angular frequency @xmath41 of te mode with a given in - plane wave vector @xmath42 in such planar waveguide system has the following form @xcite : @xmath43 equation ( 3 ) can be cast in the following transcendent equation which relates @xmath44=@xmath45 , @xmath38@xmath46@xmath44@xmath46(@xmath40,@xmath39 ) , with the dimensionless in - plane wavenumber @xmath47 : @xmath48= \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{\\left[\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{\\epsilon_{eff}}}+\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\epsilon_{t}}{\\epsilon_{eff}}}\\right]\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{f}}{\\epsilon_{eff}}-1}}{\\frac{\\epsilon_{f}}{\\epsilon_{eff}}-1-\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{\\epsilon_{eff}}}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\epsilon_{t}}{\\epsilon_{eff}}}}. \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    figure [ fig3 ] presents a numerical solution of eq .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that @xmath33 is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath50 , which can be explained by the stronger confinement inside the high - index inp layer of the cavity modes with the smaller , with respect to the layer thickness , wavelengths .",

    "the best agreement of the model of triangular - symmetry modes with the measurements is reached for the half - wavelength layer , @xmath65235 nm@xmath66 , @xmath67 being the vacuum wavelength . in this case",
    "the wave path is indeed close to the two - dimensional path in the plane of the microcavity , while the path becomes more three - dimensional for the larger slab thicknesses .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the model of triangular - symmetry modes describes better the absolute eigenfrequencies of the observed confined modes both in h5 and h3 microcavities .",

    "( 2 ) for the confined triangular - symmetry ( hexagonal - symmetry ) modes , and different bold symbols define the peaks in the optical spectra ( not shown ) measured in a new set of h5 and h3 fabricated microcavities . to include the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we have used eq . ( 4 ) [ for the same @xmath70 as in fig . [ fig5 ] ] .",
    "the agreement found with the new data also supports our model of confined photon modes with triangular symmetry .",
    "another evidence in favor of the proposed semiclassical plane - wave model can be obtained from previously published measurements of photoluminescence spectra from hexagonal microcavities in 2d photonic crystlas .",
    "for instance , one can deduce from the spectra in ref .",
    "[ ] that the spacing between the strongest photoluminescence peaks in h2 and h5 hexagonal microcavities in 2d phcs scales with the cavity size r as 1/r .",
    "namely , the spacing between the two strongest neighbor peaks seen in figs .",
    "2b and 2c of ref .",
    "[ ] are approximately equal to 130 and 53 nm for h2 and h5 microcavities , respectively .",
    "the ratio of these peak spacings is indeed close to the value 5/2 , given by the inverse ratio of the cavity sizes .",
    "another earlier observation , to which we can refer in support of our proposed plane - wave model is the blue shift of spontaneous emission spectra from the suspended 2d phc microcavities , surrounded from both sides by air , with respect to the spectra from microcavities grown on si wafer with sio@xmath71 transfer layer , see figs . 1 and 8 in ref .",
    "[ ] . the effective refractive index @xmath33 of the planar photonic microcavity is lower in the former structure which results in the blue shift of the cavity eigenfrequencies , in accordance with eq .",
    "( 2 ) .    in connection with aforementioned comparison between the",
    "predicted and observed microcavity photon eigenmodes , it is important to emphasize that the reason why the triangular - symmetry modes give the predominant contribution to photoluminescence spectra in actual heterostructures is possibly related with relatively high @xmath72 @xmath73 of these modes which increases the coupling of these modes to the vacuum states , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "namely , as follows from the comparison of the ray paths for the triangular- and hexagonal - symmerty modes in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , the hexagonal - symmetry modes are confined more close to the cavity boundary and therefore give less contribution to the far - field emission from the cavity , which comes mainly from the `` bulk - like '' cavity eigenmodes .",
    "the same arguments can be applied to the comparison between the emission strengths of the bulk - like trianguar - symmetry modes in hexagonal microcavities and a dense set of cavity eigenmodes , which were predicted for h5 hexagonal microcavities in 2d phc with the use of finite - difference time - domain simulations in ref .",
    "[ ] . as it is explained in ref .",
    "[ ] , only few of the predicted eigenmodes can emit strong enough far - field radiation , the other eigenmodes have very `` spotty patterns '' which suppress the emission .",
    "it is also worth mentioning in this connection that the possible origin of some of the less strong peaks , in comparison with that given by the triangular - symmetry modes , in the observed photoluminescence spectra [ fig . 2 in ref .",
    "[ ] ] can be the additional cavity eigenmodes caused by the splitting of the degenerate triangular - symmetry eigenmodes in hexagonal cavities by fabrication imperfections and defects .",
    "the splitting of spectrally degenerate cavity modes by unavoidable cavity imperfections was previously observed and studied , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] .    at this point ,",
    "let us remember that dielectric microresonators and microcavities with hexagonal shape , which are often called as whispering - gallery resonators , have also attracted much interest for possible optical applications in recent years .",
    "the whispering - gallery modes in dielectric resonators with hexagonal shape correspond to the hexagonal - symmetry modes in hexagonal microcavities in 2d phc ( see fig . [ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "the `` horizontal '' emission from such dielectric microresonators is achieved by the coupling of the confined phonon modes with tm polarization to the vacuum states . a semiclassical plane - wave model of triangular - symmetry modes can also be applied to quasi-2d planar dielectric microresonators .",
    "recent studies of dielectric microresonators made of zinc oxide ( zno ) nanoneedles with hexagonal cross section have been reported in ref . .",
    "the refractive index n of zno is close to 2 and , therefore , the critical angle of incidence for total internal reflection in the microresonator is close to @xmath74 . since the angle of incidence of triangular - symmetry ( whispering - gallery ) modes in hexagonal microresonator is @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) ,",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) , the triangular - symmetry modes in planar , with half - wavelength thickness @xmath76 , dielectric microresonators made of zno can be considered as @xmath77 counterparts of @xmath78-@xmath77 whispering - gallery modes .",
    "in summary , theoretical and experimental evidences have been presented showing that confined double - degenerated photon eigenmodes with triangular symmetry can be the origin of the emission peaks observed in the optical spectra from planar hexagonal microcavities in 2d photonic crystals . here ,",
    "an analytical semiclassical plane - wave model , which takes into consideration electrodynamic properties of quasi-2d planar photonic microcavity , has been developed for the quantitative evaluation of the eigenfrequencies of the photon modes , laterally localized due to the total internal reflection in the middle of photonic crystal bandgap .",
    "this analytical model describes quantitatively the experimentally observed cavity - size and photonic - crystal - thickness dependencies of the eigenfrequencies of the confined photon modes .",
    "removal of the degeneracy and change of eigenfrequencies of the confined photon modes are predicted for hexagonal microcavities with imperfections and for microcavities in the form of distorted hexagon .",
