    "the production of charmonium states @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been measured in nucleus ",
    "nucleus ( a+a ) collisions at cern sps over the last 15 years by the na38 and na50 collaborations .",
    "this experimental program was motivated by a suggestion of matsui and satz @xcite to use the @xmath0 as a probe of the state of matter created in the early stage of the collision ( see also ref.@xcite for a recent review ) .    in the original picture @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath0 particles are created in primary nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( n+n ) collisions when the charm - anticharm quark pairs are produced .",
    "the fraction ( a few percents ) of initial charm pairs which formed a @xmath0 state is subsequently reduced in a+a collisions because of the @xmath0 suppression by a factor which depends upon the details associated with the impact parameter and energy of the collisions .",
    "the statistical approach , proposed in ref.@xcite , assumes that @xmath0 mesons are created at hadronization according to the available hadronic phase - space similar to other ( lighter ) hadrons .",
    "we call this a hadron gas ( hg ) model",
    ".    recently a picture of the @xmath0 creation via coalescence ( recombination ) of charmed quarks was developed within several model approaches @xcite .",
    "similar to the hg model @xcite , the charmonium states are assumed to be formed at the hadronization stage .",
    "however , they are produced as a coalescence of earlier created @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 yield and the total charm yield are connected to each other and differ in general from the hg equilibrium values .",
    "a principal quantity to be studied in our paper is the ratio of the the @xmath0 multiplicity to the total number of @xmath4 pairs , @xmath5 , created in a+a collisions : @xmath6 in the standard picture of @xmath0 suppression , the number of primary @xmath0 particles is proportional to the number of directly produced @xmath4 pairs with invariant mass below @xmath7 meson threshold @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the subthreshold pairs in the total number of @xmath5 decreases when the collision energy @xmath8 grows .",
    "the number of initially produced @xmath0 particles is further reduced because of their inelastic interactions with nucleons from the colliding nuclei .",
    "this effect becomes stronger when the number of participants increases .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 particles can be destroyed by the secondary hadrons ( co - movers ) created in the a+a collision . the density of these hadrons increases with both @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the decreasing of the ratio @xmath10 due to the above mentioned effects is known as _ ` normal @xmath0 suppression'_. the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at large values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 is supposed to lead to a sudden and strong drop of the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "this is called _ `",
    "anomalous @xmath0 suppression'_. therefore , there is an unambiguous consequence of the standard picture @xcite : when the collision energy per nucleon pair @xmath8 and/or the number of nucleon participants @xmath9 increase , the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) decreases .    in models where the @xmath0 mesons are produced by recombination of charm quarks at the hadronization stage",
    ", the picture can be much different .",
    "for the large number of @xmath4 pairs @xmath11 expected at the rhic energies , the charmonium states can be formed from a @xmath2 and @xmath3 which were initially created in different @xmath4 pairs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the multiplicity of @xmath0 due to recombination of charm quarks should be roughly proportional to : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total multiplicity of produced hadrons . in this case",
    "the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) may be constant or even increase ( we call this _ ` @xmath0 enhancement ' _ ) with @xmath9 and/or @xmath8 depending on the underlying physics which generates @xmath4 pairs and charmonium states .",
    "we consider the canonical ensemble formulation @xcite of the statistical coalescence model ( scm ) @xcite to describe the @xmath2 and @xmath3 recombination into the charmonium states at the hadronization stage .",
    "a canonical rather than the more familiar grand canonical formalism is required as we must properly account for the small numbers of charm quarks which are present .",
    "when large numbers of charm quarks are produced in each collision , these two formalisms become equivalent , but the grand canonical formalism fails for small numbers . as in the standard picture , the charm is created at the very early stage of a+a reaction via hard parton collisions .",
    "the @xmath0 formation is however very different in the standard picture of the @xmath0 suppression @xcite and in the scm .",
    "this leads to very different relations between the open charm and charmonium yields .    in the analysis below we present also two possibilities of charm chemical equilibration",
    "first , we assume that both the open charm and charmonium yields correspond to a chemically equilibrated hadronic gas .",
    "this scenario is the most extreme in its assumptions , but provides a benchmark for the dispersion of various theoretical results .",
    "another possibility is that the number of @xmath4 pairs , which is an input for the scm , equals to the equilibrium value in the qgp just before its hadronization .",
    "these two possibilities are the extremes of scenarios with chemical equilibration of charm .",
    "we do not pretend that these extreme cases really represent what happens in heavy ion collisions .",
    "they are studied to complete our analysis .",
    "in fact , the hard parton collisions seem to be the dominant source of the @xmath4 pairs created at the rhic energies .",
    "the issue we want to address in this paper is how to disentangle the different scenarios of charm and charmonium production .",
    "it will be shown that the different pictures have a much different dependence on both @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "distinctive signatures of each of these pictures will be found .",
    "we shall argue that @xmath0 measurements at rhic energies , especially in combination with a measurement of open charm , will go far towards resolving the various pictures .",
    "of course , to really disentangle different scenarios , it is useful to be a little more quantitative .",
    "that is the central purpose of this paper .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the equilibrium hg model for the open charm and charmonium production .",
    "the picture of the scm is described in section 3 .",
    "the results and conclusions of the paper are presented respectively in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "the equilibrium hg model describes the hadron yields measured in a+a collisions in terms of three parameters : volume @xmath14 , temperature @xmath15 and baryonic chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "this model seems to work in the ags ",
    "sps energy region describing successfully not only the pion and ( anti)nucleon yields but ( multi)strange hadron abundances as well ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for the rhic energies the temperature parameter @xmath15 is expected to be similar to that for the sps energies : @xmath17  mev .",
    "the baryonic chemical potential becomes small ( @xmath18 ) and decreases with the collision energy .",
    "does the hg model work for the charm and charmonium yields in a+a collisions ?",
    "the answer on this question is rather uncertain at present .",
    "there are no open charm yield data measured in a+a collisions .",
    "this may be a reason why there were no attempts to calculate the open charm hadron yield within the hg model .",
    "the hg model assumes the following formula for the hadron thermal multiplicities in the grand canonical ensemble : @xmath19^{-1}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the volume and temperature of the hg system , @xmath20 , @xmath21 denote hadron masses and degeneracy factors .",
    "the particle chemical potential @xmath22 in eq.([stat ] ) is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denote the baryonic number strangeness and charm of particle @xmath25 .",
    "the baryonic chemical potential @xmath16 regulates the baryonic density of the hg system whereas strange @xmath26 and charm @xmath27 chemical potentials should be found from the requirement of zero value for the total strangeness and charm in the system ( in our consideration we neglect small effects of a non - zero electrical chemical potential ) .",
    "some of the particles which are observed after a nuclear collision result from the decay of resonances which have decoupled after the matter fell out of equilibrium .",
    "the total multiplicities @xmath28 of such observed particles in the hg model are therefore the sum of : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the corresponding resonance decay branching ratios ( both strong and electromagnetic decays are taken into account ) .",
    "the temperatures and chemical potentials used in these relationships are those at decoupling .",
    "the hadron yield ratios @xmath31 in the grand canonical ensemble are therefore known functions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 variables , and are independent of the volume parameter @xmath14",
    ".    for the thermal multiplicities of both open charm and charmonium states the bose and fermi effects are negligible .",
    "this is because the charm quark mass is so large that the system is always dilute for charm quark densities .",
    "therefore , eq.([stat ] ) is simplified to : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the hg model gives the @xmath0 yield : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are calculated according to eq.([gce ] ) and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the decay branching ratios of the excited charmonium states into @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath42  mev leads to the hg value of the thermal ratio of @xmath43 : @xmath44 in agreement with data @xcite in central ( @xmath45 ) pb+pb collisions .",
    "this fact was first noticed in ref.@xcite . at small @xmath9 as well as in p+p and p+a",
    "collisions the measured value of the @xmath46 ratio is several times larger than its statistical mechanics estimate ( [ psiratio ] ) .",
    "therefore , different versions of the statistical approach considered in this paper will be restricted to a+a collisions with @xmath47 .",
    "we do not intend here to describe the open and hidden charm production in p+p , p+a and in very peripheral a+a collisions within the statistical models .",
    "of course the temperature of decoupling of the hadron gas is quite large , and one should properly be worried about the consistency of such a description .",
    "it nevertheless does provide a fair description of available data on particle production .",
    "as such , it provides a standard against which interesting new physics might be calibrated .",
    "the numbers of charm quarks produced in high energy nuclear collisions need not be large .",
    "implicit in the grand canonical ensemble treatment is this large number assumption .",
    "the canonical ensemble treatment is valid for any small number of particles , and we now employ it to properly describe charm abundances .    in the canonical ensemble formulation",
    "the thermal charmonium multiplicities are still given by eq.([gce ] ) for a grand canonical ensemble as charmonium states have zero net charm .",
    "the multiplicities given by this equation ( [ gce ] ) for open charm hadrons are modified by an additional multiplicative ` canonical suppression ' factor .",
    "this has been shown , for example , in reference @xcite ) .",
    "the suppression factor is the same for all individual open charm states .",
    "therefore , if @xmath48 is the total grand canonical ensemble multiplicity of all open charm and anticharm mesons and ( anti)baryons , then the canonical ensemble ( c.e . )",
    "value of the total open charm is equal to : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the modified bessel functions . to find @xmath48 we use eq.([gce ] ) for thermal multiplicities of the open charm hadrons in the grand canonical ensemble and take the summation over all known particles and resonances with open charm @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath51 in this equation is due to the exact charm conservation . for @xmath52 one",
    "has @xmath53 and , therefore , the canonical ensemble total open charm multiplicity @xmath54 is strongly suppressed in comparison to the corresponding grand canonical ensemble result . at sps energies the canonical ensemble suppression effects , due to small numbers of produced charm , are important for the thermal open charm yield even in the most central pb+pb collisions .",
    "these suppression effects become crucial when the number of participants @xmath9 decreases .",
    "note that for @xmath55 the multiplicities of the open charm hadrons are proportional to @xmath56 in the canonical ensemble hg formulation ( instead of @xmath14 in the grand canonical ensemble ) . in the opposite case @xmath57 , @xmath58 ,",
    "therefore the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble results coincide : @xmath59 . in a high energy collision of heavy nuclei , the average numbers of produced ( anti)baryons , ( anti)strange hadrons and charged particles are much larger than @xmath60 . due to this fact , the baryonic number",
    ", strangeness and electric charge of the hg system can be treated according to the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "this is not true in general for charm .",
    "the number of @xmath4 pairs in the hg , @xmath61 , is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total hg multiplicity of particles with hidden charm .",
    "we can now calculate the @xmath0 multiplicity , since this involves only knowing the grand canonical ensemble results for @xmath64 bound states , and the total open charm multiplicity @xmath65 , since we now have the canonical ensemble results in hand ( [ noce ] ) .",
    "we need the chemical freeze - out parameters @xmath66 for a+a collisions . for the rhic energies the temperature parameter @xmath15",
    "is expected to be similar to that for the sps energies : @xmath17  mev . to fix the unknown volume parameter @xmath14 and baryonic chemical potential @xmath16 we use the parametrization of the total pion multiplicity @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68  gev@xmath69 and @xmath70 is the nucleon mass .",
    "eq.([pionexp ] ) is in an agreement with both the sps data and the preliminary rhic data in au+au collisions at @xmath71  gev and @xmath72  gev .",
    "the pion multiplicity ( [ pionexp ] ) should be equated to the total hg pion multiplicity @xmath73 calculated according to eq.([dec ] ) which accounts for resonance decays into pionic final states .",
    "the hg parameters @xmath14 and @xmath16 are found then as the solution of the following coupled equations : @xmath74~,\\\\   \\label{np } n_p~ & = & ~v~n_b(t,\\mu_b)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the hg baryonic density . in these calculations",
    "we fix the temperature parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the baryonic chemical potential for au+au collisions at the rhic energies is small ( @xmath18 ) and decreases with collision energy .",
    "therefore , most of the thermal hg multiplicities become close to their limiting values at @xmath76 . consequently most of hadron ratios @xmath31 become independent of the collision energy .",
    "if we assume that the charm quarks reach their chemically equilibrated values , then the chemical potential for charm vanishes .",
    "we can then compute the abundances of charmonium .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 to negatively charged hadrons is only weakly dependent on the collision energy as a consequence of the considerations of the previous paragraph and equals approximately to : @xmath77 for @xmath78  mev and @xmath79  mev , respectively .",
    "the result ( [ psihmin ] ) is close to the estimate @xcite of this ratio , @xmath80 , extracted from the na50 data in pb+pb collisions at 158 a  gev .      in this section",
    ", we developed the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble formalism for describing abundances of particles in thermal equilibrium .",
    "nucleon and pion abundances were used to constrain the parameters of these treatments : volume and baryon chemical potential .",
    "the temperature of the chemical freeze - out was assumed to be equal to its value at sps energies .",
    "formulae were derived for the abundances of open charm and hidden charm ( @xmath64 states ) . in particular",
    ", the charm to negative charge particle multiplicity comes out correctly within such a naive treatment .",
    "one has serious reservation about the concept of charm chemical equilibration within hg approach .",
    "the hg system is expected to exist for a much shorter time than is needed for the chemical equilibration of charm .",
    "it is more reasonable to assume that the charm quark - antiquark pairs are created at the early stage of a+a reaction and the number of @xmath4 pairs remains approximately unchanged during the further evolution . after the hadronization , the system would correspond then to the hg picture with a nonequilibrium value of the total charm .",
    "we imagine two possible scenarios . in the first",
    ", we imagine the @xmath64 pairs reach their equilibrium values in the quark gluon plasma which precedes the hadronic gas .",
    "we call this the qgp + scm model , where the scm means statistical coalescence model . in the second",
    ", we imagine the @xmath64 pairs are produced by hard qcd processes early in the collision , and are unchanged by the presence of the hadronic gas or of the quark gluon plasma . this scenario",
    "we refer to as the pqcd + scm model .",
    "the scm @xcite assumes that the charmonium states are formed at the hadronization stage .",
    "this is similar to the hg model @xcite .",
    "however , the charmonium states are produced via a coalescence of earlier created @xmath4 quarks .",
    "the number of @xmath4 pairs , @xmath5 , differs in general from the result expected in the equilibrium hg .",
    "one needs then a new parameter @xmath81 @xcite to adjust the thermal hg results to the required number of @xmath5 fixed by the early stage evolution . in the grand canonical ensemble , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the chemical potential for @xmath84 pairs",
    "this is analogous to the introduction of the strangeness suppression factor @xmath85 @xcite in the hg model , when the total strangeness observed is smaller than its chemical equilibrium value .    at high collision energies we find",
    "@xmath86 so that the open charm hadron yield is enhanced by a factor @xmath81 and charmonium yield by a factor @xmath87 in comparison with the equilibrium hg predictions . the canonical ensemble formulation of the scm , as shown in ref .",

    "it gives only a tiny correction to the first term .",
    "most of the created @xmath4 pairs are transformed into the open charm hadrons .    if @xmath90 , eq.([ncc1 ] )",

    ". for lower rhic energy @xmath71  gev the value of @xmath5 could be close to ( or even smaller than ) unity so that the canonical ensemble suppression effects for the open charm are still important .",
    "note that for the non - central a+a collisions the total charm decreases essentially so that the canonical ensemble suppression effects become stronger , hence their consideration is necessary to study the @xmath9 dependence of the charmonium production even at the upper rhic energy .",

    "the number of @xmath4 pairs is proportional to the system volume .",
    "therefore the ratio r becomes constant when @xmath90 .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath148 ratio is rather different when @xmath149 and the canonical suppression factor in eq.([ncc1 ] ) plays a crucial role .",
    "one finds @xmath150 and then @xmath151 for pqcd+scm .",
    "the value of @xmath10 , however , does not depend on @xmath81 : @xmath152 the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) decreases with both the collision energy ( approximately like @xmath153 ) and the number of nucleon participants ( approximately like @xmath154 ) and does not depend on the charm production mechanism .",
    "this behavior is similar to the standard picture of the @xmath0 suppression .",
    "@xmath0 suppression _ in pqcd+scm happens at the sps energy .",
    "this energy is still `` low '' as @xmath155 even in the most central pb+pb collisions .",
    "@xmath0 suppression _",
    "( i.e. the decrease of the @xmath156 ratio ) with @xmath9 and/or @xmath8 continues up to the rhic energies for the peripheral collisions with small number of nucleon participants .",
    "this changes into the _ @xmath0 enhancement _ when both @xmath9 and @xmath8 are `` large '' .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath4 production is described by the pqcd , the statistical coalescence model predicts the decrease of the ratio @xmath10 ( [ ratio ] ) with @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 ( the @xmath0 _ suppression _ ) when @xmath157",
    ". however , this ratio increases with @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 ( the @xmath0 _ enhancement _ ) when @xmath142 .",

    "other models for @xmath0 production via coalescence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the hadronization stage @xcite give similar _ qualitative _ result : the @xmath0 _ enhancement _ for central collisions at high energies .",

    "they are rather close for @xmath0 to negative hadron ratio : @xmath163 @xcite and @xmath164 in the pqcd+scm",
    ". however , the total charm production is rather different : @xmath165 in ref.@xcite and @xmath166 in our pqcd estimation .",
    "the statistical production of @xmath0 mesons in au+au collisions at rhic energies has been studied .",
    "the obtained results are qualitatively different from the standard picture of the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath167 collisions @xcite , if the average number of produced charmed quark - antiquark pairs per event is large @xmath90 .",
    "the standard picture leads to monotonic decrease of the ratio @xmath10 ( the ratio of the @xmath0 multiplicity to the total number of charm quark - antiquark pairs ) with both the collision energy and the number of participating nucleons .",
    "we predict another behavior .",
    "the reason for this difference is the completely distinct physical pictures for charmonia formation .",
    "the standard picture supposes the charmonia states to be created _ exclusively _ in primary nucleon - nucleon collisions at the early stage of the reaction so that all subsequent interactions can only destroy them .",
    "we study another possibility : creation of charmed and charmonium particles at the hadronization stage . in our opinion ,",
    "the most probable scenario of the charmonium production in a+a collisions at the rhic energies is the following ( we call it pqcd+scm ) : @xmath4 pairs are produced exclusively in hard parton collisions at the early stage of a+a reaction ( pqcd ) , and these charmed quarks and antiquarks are redistributed in the open and hidden charm hadrons according to the statistical mechanics prescriptions at the hadronization stage ( scm ) .",
    "this model predicts a strong increase of the ratio @xmath10 with the collision energy or the number of nucleon participants ( @xmath0 _ enhancement _ ) , provided that the total number of produced @xmath4 pairs per event is essentially larger than @xmath60 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled at the highest rhic energy @xmath92  gev already for @xmath168 and also at lower rhic energies for the most central au+au collisions ( @xmath169 ) .    to get a feeling of possible effects of the charm creation ( annihilation ) by secondary parton and/or hadron rescatterings we have considered two extreme models of charm chemical equilibration : in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp+scm ) and in the hadron gas ( hg ) .",
    "both models predict almost constant ratio @xmath10 at @xmath90 .",
    "there is however a quantitative difference : qgp+scm predicts much larger value of @xmath10 and much larger value of the total charm than pqcd+scm and hg models .",
    "the predictions of the hg model for the open charm and charmonium production at the upper rhic energies are below the results of the pqcd+scm and qgp+scm .",
    "our predictions for the behavior of @xmath10 at @xmath90 ( @xmath0 enhancement ) in the pqcd+scm are in a qualitative agreement with other coalescence models @xcite , but quantitatively the results are rather different .    we conclude that @xmath113 collision experiments at rhic offer a possibility to disentangle various models of the open charm and charmonia production . even those models that give very similar results at sps energies become quantitatively and even qualitatively different at rhic .",
    "measurements of the @xmath0 productions combined with the open charm measurements are needed to give a definite answer about the dominant mechanisms of hidden and open charm production in ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy nuclei .",
