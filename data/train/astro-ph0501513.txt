    "the detection of the peak in the far - infrared background at 140@xmath0 m by the cobe - dirbe instrument has emphasized that much of the star formation in the universe has taken place in dust enshrouded environments and that the galaxies responsible have undergone strong evolution to the present epoch ( e.g. hauser et al .  , lagache & puget  ) . this evolution has also been inferred and confirmed at wavelengths from 7 - 170@xmath0 m by a progression of increasingly inspiring space missions from _ iras _ , _ iso _ to _ spitzer _ ( soifer et al .  , kessler et al .  ,",

    "the mid - infrared spectra of star - forming galaxies are dominated by a complex set of emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 & 12.7@xmath0 m attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules and the silicate absorption feature at 9.7@xmath0 m ( boulanger et al .  ,",

    "the adopted sed is the most important factor in the models .",
    "the complicated nature of the mid - infrared spectra and the variation between models , even for more normal galaxies can have a dramatic effect on the derived source counts of a galaxy population . in the final analysis of the elais survey , rowan - robinson et al .",
    "have shown that the infrared galaxy population can be divided into 4 distinct spectral classes of normal quiescent ( cirrus ) galaxies , starbust ( m82 ) galaxies , lig / ulig ( @xmath11 ) sources ( arp220 ) and agn ( dust torus ) .",

    "although , for the normal galaxies , the effect of changing the sed in the 24@xmath0 m band is minimal , at 15@xmath0 m the original model produced excess power in the differential counts at the level of a few mjy due to extremely strong and narrow pah emission , masking the evolutionary upturn in the differential counts at that level .    for the starburst template , the critical point in the sed",
    "is where the wien - side of the dust emmission curve meets the mid - infrared pah emmission .",
    "analysis of model starburst seds shows a large variation in resulting k - corrections due to 2 factors , the slope of the sed at this point ( an increasing slope to shorter wavelengths producing a favourable negative k - correction ) and the inclusion of distinct 12.7@xmath0 m & 11.3@xmath0 m features to produce a more accurate distribution of mid - infrared features ( boulanger et al .  ,",
    "diedenhoven et al .  ) .",
    "thus we have retained the original starburst ( m82 like ) sed of efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen   but have replaced the sed in the range from 18 - 5@xmath0 m , with the observed isocam circular variable filter spectrum of forster schreiber et al .  .",

    "the luminous infrared galaxy population is represented by the archetypical arp220 sed of efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen   which gives a good fit of the spectrum of arp220 from sub - mm to optical wavelengths and is in reasonable agreement with the results of spoon et al .  .",
    "note that although it is known that arp220 has an atypical far - infrared / mid - infrared luminosity ratio , we justify its use by the fact that it provides good fits to many of the elais sources  @xcite and has more typical 6.7 - 12 - 15@xmath0 m luminosity ratios  @xcite .",

    "pozzi et al .   have fitted the elais - s 15@xmath0 m counts assuming an evloving starburst population with @xmath20 , @xmath23 .",
    "although assuming the pozzi et al .   evolution for the starburst component presented in this work does indeed provide a good fit at 15@xmath0 m , it also produces an excess at around 1mjy in the 24@xmath0 m band , thus counts at fluxes of around 0.5 - 2mjy , in the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m band can provide good constraints on the z@xmath61 evolution .",
    "in contrast , the more extreme burst model predicts that the upturn at mjy level fluxes at 15@xmath0 m and the peak of the counts at 24@xmath0 m are attributed to the emergence of a new population of lig / ulig sources . finally , both the _ bright end _ model and the _ burst _ model predict that the peak in the 24@xmath0 m differential counts at @xmath10.2mjy is produced by the luminous lig - ulig population consistent with the early analysis of the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m data ( yan et al .  , le floch et al .  ) .",
    "thus , although from figure  [ counts ] both models are in agreement as to the origin of the dominant source population at 24@xmath0 m , they differ in their prediction for the source of the upturn ( note , not the peak ) in the differential counts at 15@xmath0 m , thus it is the counts at 15@xmath0 m that have a better chance of distinguishing between the two evolutionary scenarios . for the _ burst _ model",
    ", we would expect to see a significantly higher fractional contribution of lig / ulig sources ( an order of magnitude in the differential counts at the mjy level ) that simply are not appreciably present in the _ bright end _ model .",
    "note that at the depth of the elais survey ( @xmath24 ) the predictions of both models are consistent with the near - infrared and optical imaging of the elais - s field by pozzi et al .",

    "find a high proportion @xmath114@xmath2 of uligs in the elias final band merged catalogue .",
    "this proportion is @xmath110@xmath2 for the _ bright end _ model .",
    "the _ burst _",
    "model predicts a fraction of @xmath130@xmath2 which is still consistent with the elais results if the blank optical identifications ( @xmath110@xmath2 ) can be attributed to luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "spectroscopy of the elais - s sources has been made by la franca et al .  .",
    "of @xmath187@xmath2 of sources spectroscopically identified , two populations dominated the 15@xmath0 m sources over the range 0.5 - 150mjy , with approximately three quarters contribution coming from normal to extreme starbursts and the remaining contribution coming from agn . around @xmath118@xmath2 of the elais - s sources have no counterpart to optical maginitudes r@xmath323 .",
    "moreover la franca et al .",
    "have shown that it is these sources are responsible for the upturn in the differential sources counts around @xmath11mjy at 15@xmath0 m and that they are expected to have luminosities in the @xmath25 range , i.e. luminous and ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies .    from figure",
    "[ counts ] , it can be seen that although both the fainter 15@xmath0 m & 24@xmath0 m differential counts can be well fitted at the fainter fluxes , the brighter counts are slightly underestimated in the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m band .",
    "this could be attributed to some variance in the _ spitzer _ fields since the initial counts from the swire survey are somewhat lower at fluxes brighter than 10mjy ( shupe et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . alternatively , this effect could be due to a low normalization in the assumed elais - s field luminosity function since although there is a good agreement with the evolution found in the deeper _ iso _ surveys , including the upturn in the differential counts , in the brighter flux range of 0.5 - 10mjy , the counts in the elais - s field are systematically lower than the ( corrected ) northern elais fields and the fainter iso surveys ( serjeant et al .  , vaisanen et al .  , vaccari et al .  , rodighiero et al .  ) .",
    "both evolutionary models are found to be broadly consistent with the 15@xmath0 m redshift distribution at bright fluxes with a median redshift consistent with that found for the elais sources ( pozzi et al .",
    ", rowan - robinson et al .  )",

    "at this redshift ( z@xmath10.95 ) the 7.7@xmath0 m rest frame feature passes through the _ iso _ 15@xmath0 m band producing strong k - corrections , which combined with the strong evolution produces the redshift peak .",
    "the effect of the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate absorption feature is also prominent at z@xmath10.5 and is consistent with the drop in density of galaxies observed in the elais - s field at this redshift  @xcite . at 24@xmath0 m",
    "a bimodal redshift distribution is seen at z@xmath11 & @xmath12.5 corresponding to the passage of the 6.2 - 7.7@xmath0 m and 11.3 - 12.7@xmath0 m features respectively .",
    "a similar bimodal distribution has also been suggested by chary et al .   although the models presented here predict a greater contribution from higher luminosity infrared sources .",
    "a significant deficit of sources is seen at z@xmath11.5 which can be attributed to the effect of the silicate feature at 9.7@xmath0 m .",
    "although the two evolutionary scenarios predict a different origin for the dominant population at low redshifts , both models are unanimous in predicting a new population of infra - red luminous sources in the redshift range , z=1 - 3 .",
    "the scuba sub - mm population would seem likely candidates for this population of sources , indeed observations in the mips 24@xmath0 m band of scuba sources in the lockman hole detected almost all of the sources in the range z@xmath10.5 - 3.5  @xcite . furthermore , the redshift distribution of the high - z _ spitzer _ sources and their predicted luminosity range ( lig - ulig ) correlates well with the median redshift of 2.2 - 2.5 found for sub - mm sources ( chapman et al .  ,  , frayer et al .  ) .",
    "luminous / ultraluminous galaxies are responsible for the peak at around 0.25mjy in the 24@xmath0 m differential counts in both models . at this flux level",
    "both models predict of the order of more than 1000 such sources per square degree and typical sub - mm fluxes at 850@xmath0 m of 3 - 5mjy over the redshift range 1 - 2.5 , in very good agreement with the observed submillimetre source density in this flux range observed by scuba  @xcite .",
