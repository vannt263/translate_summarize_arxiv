    "according to the two - fluid model , the flow in superfluids at finite temperatures involves separate motions of the normal and superfluid components .",
    "these components have densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 and velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . in this paper",
    "we are concerned only with processes which happen at nearly constant temperature . in such simplified cases",
    "the equations of the two - fluid hydrodynamics can be understood to originate from the euler equation for the superfluid component and from the navier - stokes equation for the normal component , with the mutual friction force providing the interaction between the two components @xcite .",
    "the mutual friction interaction is mediated by quantized vortex lines . when a straight vortex moves with velocity @xmath5 in a superfluid it experiences two forces ( fig .",
    "[ friction]a ) : the first one is the magnus lift force from the superfluid component @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the quantum of circulation and @xmath8 is a unit vector along the vortex core .",
    "the second force arises from the scattering of the quasiparticles , which form the normal component , from the vortex cores .",
    "it has the components @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( the subscript @xmath12 denotes projections to the plane perpendicular to the vortex core ) .",
    "vortex mass can usually be ignored and the equation of motion reduces simply to the force balance , @xmath13 . solving this for @xmath5 yields @xmath14 here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mutual friction parameters , characteristics of the superfluid , which describe the interaction of thermal quasiparticles with the vortex cores . inserting @xmath5 from eq .   to the expression for @xmath17 we find that in the mutual friction force @xmath18 the term with @xmath19 is always directed opposite to the so - called counterflow velocity @xmath20 and thus leads to dissipation , while the term with @xmath21 is non - dissipative .",
    "the mutual friction force can be averaged over vortex lines if they are locally parallel to each other . in this case",
    "we get a force per unit mass of the superfluid component @xmath22   -\\alpha ' ( \\vels - \\veln ) \\times \\oms~. \\label{eq : fns}\\ ] ] here the vorticity @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath25 .",
    "note that the friction coefficients in eq .",
    "are the same as in eq .   only because complete local polarization of vortex lines is assumed .",
    "later we will introduce effective mutual friction parameters to describe phenomenologically situations where this is not the case .",
    "if the vortex line is curved , then its tension @xmath26 , originating from the quantized superflow around the core , leads to an additional force acting perpendicular to the core .",
    "balancing it against the magnus force and averaging over the vortex lines we get the contribution @xmath27",
    "where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the intervortex distance and @xmath30 is the core size . including the tension force to the balance of forces acting on a vortex modifies also the expression for the mutual friction force , but we will not consider this here . since @xmath31 has the small prefactor @xmath32 , in many cases it can be neglected . however , there are situations where it is essential , like in the kelvin - wave instability @xcite or in the angular momentum balance of the propagating vortex front @xcite , considered below .",
    "inserting the @xmath33 and @xmath31 forces to the euler equation , we get the coarse - grained hydrodynamic equation for the superfluid component @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the chemical potential . to account for the normal component , one inserts the @xmath33 force with a negative sign to the navier - stokes equation , where the viscous term then damps the drive from mutual friction . by comparing the magnitudes of these two terms ,",
    "it is possible to work out a criterion , when the normal component can be considered not to respond to the motion of the superfluid component in the hydrodynamic regime @xcite : @xmath36 .",
    "here @xmath37 is the kinematic viscosity of the normal component .",
    "the fermi superfluid @xmath0he has a large value of @xmath38 , which satisfies this criterion and allows us to consider the normal component as stationary .",
    "this is quite unlike bose superfluids where usually @xmath39 @xcite . at low temperatures in the ballistic regime of quasiparticle",
    "motion one might expect that the drag from the quasiparticle gas on the vortex lines depends strongly on the ratio of the intervortex distance to the scattering cross - section in the quasiparticle - vortex scattering process .",
    "it turns out that at the typical experimental values of @xmath40 mm this consideration is not important .",

    "the results are in fair agreement with the theory of mutual friction which includes the iordanskii force from the scattering of bulk thermal quasiparticles by the flow field around the vortex @xcite and the kopnin force originating from the spectral flow of the vortex - core - bound fermions and their scattering from the bulk quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the energy gap @xmath48 in the spectrum of bulk quasiparticles is the main source for the fast variation of mutual friction with temperature .",
    "the original measurements left an uncertainty @xcite whether the accepted value of the gap should be renormalized to fit the experimental data .",
    "new measurements of friction to lower temperatures @xcite leave no doubt that the bulk @xmath48 properly describes the temperature dependence , in accordance with theory ( insert in fig .",
    "[ friction]b ) .",
    "an unsolved problem , both experimentally and theoretically , is the behavior of mutual friction at very low temperatures , below about @xmath49 . there is a prediction of a new friction mechanism @xcite , which depends on the acceleration of vortex lines , but not on temperature and thus allows for a finite dissipation even at zero temperature through the emission of non - thermal quasiparticles from the vortex cores",
    "there are observations of temperature - independent contributions to friction @xcite , but it is not yet clear , whether they can be attributed to a mechanism of this kind .",
    "to establish the ranges of stability for laminar and turbulent flows in superfluids with a stationary normal component , one can apply the same dimensional arguments as used in classical hydrodynamics , by introducing the reynolds number re .",
    "the classical reynolds number @xmath50 has the physical meaning of being the ratio of the magnitudes of the inertial and dissipative terms in the navier - stokes equation . here",

    "turbulent motion is observed for @xmath53 . in superfluids , starting from eq .   for the superfluid velocity , we put @xmath54 and omit the tension term so that we get the equation @xmath55 here the inertial term is the same as in the navier - stokes equation , but renormalized with the prefactor @xmath56 .",
    "the dissipative term , proportional to @xmath19 , has a completely different structure .",
    "in fact , both the inertial and dissipative terms have the same scaling @xmath57 and thus their ratio becomes an internal parameter of the superfluid , independent of the velocity and the geometry of the flow @xcite @xmath58 this parameter has the same physical meaning as the reynolds number in classical hydrodynamics and thus we call it the superfluid reynolds number",
    ". in analogy to classical turbulence we can expect superfluid flow to be turbulent when @xmath59 and laminar in the opposite limit .",
    "measurements show , however , that the value of @xmath60 at the transition from laminar to turbulent dynamics , which we call the onset value @xmath61 , is actually for many types of flow much closer to unity than in classical systems .",
    "thus we write the criterion for superfluid turbulence as @xmath62 it is possible to approach the limits for quantum turbulence also from a microscopic point of view .",
    "the essential processes are vortex reconnections , growth of vortex rings , and kelvin waves on vortex lines .",
    "one can estimate within some model when these processes proliferate or when they are suppressed by mutual friction .",
    "different models have been considered : the pseudo - vinen equation @xcite , damping of kelvin waves on vortex bundles @xcite , and the reorientation of a vortex ring in circulating flow @xcite . in all cases",
    "the same criterion eq .   is obtained .",
    "he can be stabilized in the central section of the sample with a magnetic field .",
    "the upper b - phase section is about 1 cm shorter than the lower . in rotation",
    "the ab interface becomes unstable at a well - defined velocity and a bundle of @xmath63 closely packed vortex loops is injected from the a into the b phase , as shown for the upper ab interface . in the lower b - phase section an alternative way is illustrated for putting vortices in applied flow .",

    "the ratio of the inertial term to the tension term is @xmath64 an alternative , but similar definition of @xmath65 is often used .",

    "( to add to the confusion , in superfluids with a mobile normal component even more superfluid reynolds numbers can be defined . )",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath66 is different , however .",
    "the condition @xmath67 coincides with the feynman criterion which specifies when the first vortex line becomes stable in the flow @xcite .",
    "when @xmath68 the flow can support many vortex lines .",

    "flow the height of the cf peak does not decrease with time , while here it collapses suddenly . in this measurement",
    "there is not a - phase barrier layer ; thus from the arrival times of the vortex fronts to the nmr coils one obtains the moment when the turbulent burst happened ( marked with an arrow in the upper panel ) and the location of the burst , which in this measurement happens to be 4 cm above the bottom nmr coil .",
    "[ slowformation ] ]    finally , the ratio of the tension term to the dissipation term @xmath72 is the parameter which controls the superfluid decoupling phenomenon @xcite , as discussed later in this paper .",
    "many conventional methods for generating turbulence in classical liquids or in superfluid @xmath73he are not applicable in @xmath0he - b owing to the special requirements at ultra - low temperatures and the large viscosity of the normal component .",
    "the most detailed measurements of the transition to turbulence have been performed in rotating flow with a cylindrical sample container of radius @xmath52 and oriented along the rotation axis , fig .",
    "[ expsetup]a .",
    "the walls of the container are sufficiently smooth to avoid vortex pinning and surface friction .",
    "this is possible with @xmath0he - b since the vortex core radius is relatively large , @xmath74 m , depending on pressure .     and",

    "[ probabs ] ]    in uniform rotation the normal component of @xmath0he - b is in solid - body rotation : @xmath76 .",
    "the most obvious laminar solution of eq .",
    "is then @xmath77 .",
    "the formation of quantized vortices out of nothing at moderate flow velocities @xmath78cm / s is prohibited by a large energy barrier and thus this metastable vortex - free state can persist for the duration of the experiment in the absence of seed vortices @xcite .",
    "another state of laminar flow is solid - body rotation of the superfluid component at an angular velocity @xmath79 : @xmath80 . in this state",
    "the sample is filled with rectilinear vortices at a density @xmath81 , aligned along the rotation axis .",
    "if the rotation drive @xmath70 is increased from @xmath79 , then the vortices move towards the axis or if @xmath70 is reduced they move away from it . in both cases the velocity of the laminar expansion or contraction of such a cluster of parallel vortex lines is determined by @xmath19 @xcite",
    ".    one more example of laminar flow becomes important in the laminar regime of vortex motion @xmath82 , when short seed vortices initially occupy only part of the height of the cylinder , while the rest remains vortex - free .",
    "these vortices bend to the cylindrical wall , as seen in fig .",
    "[ expsetup]a .",
    "they continuously expand , until they become fully rectilinear line vortices , as their ends move with an axial velocity @xmath83 ( or somewhat smaller , depending on the curvature of the vortex ) @xcite .    among the different types of turbulence in rotating flows here we discuss only two , fig .",
    "[ expsetup]b .",
    "the first is the turbulent burst @xcite , when a few closely packed vortex loops , attached to the cylindrical wall interact via reconnections and expanding kelvin waves and quickly fill the cross - section of the cylinder within a short vertical section .",
    "the second process is the expansion of this turbulence towards the vortex - free region(s ) as propagating turbulent vortex front(s ) @xcite .",
    "the axial propagation velocity of the turbulent front @xmath84 can significantly exceed the value which the laminar expansion velocity @xmath85 would have in the same conditions .    in the experiment of fig .",
    "[ expsetup]a we first create counterflow by rotating the sample in the vortex - free state ( or a state with a few rectilinear vortices in a central cluster ) and then inject seed vortices .",
    "one injection technique uses the kelvin - helmholtz instability of the interface between the a and b phases of superfluid @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "another method is to start at a low rotation velocity @xmath86 with a few remanent vortices connected to the cylindrical wall and to create the flow by rapidly increasing rotation to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "a third useful injection technique is triggered by an absorption event of a thermal neutron which deposits , depending on the counterflow velocity , one or a few vortex loops of size @xmath87 mm close to the cylindrical wall @xcite .",
    "after injection the seed vortices interact and evolve , expanding along the cylinder . using nmr techniques ( fig .",
    "[ expsetup]c ) we measure the number of vortex lines close to both ends of the sample tube . if the vortex expansion follows the laminar scenario , then they do not reconnect , their number is not changed , and the height of the counterflow peak in the nmr spectrum decreases only a little .",
    "if a turbulent front develops , then the counterflow peak disappears completely when the front passes through a pick - up coil .",
    "there are practically no intermediate cases , which can not be classified as laminar or turbulent .",
    "an example of a measurement of the turbulent dynamics with boundary - attached seed vortices is shown in fig .",
    "[ slowformation ] .    if the vortex - injection measurement is repeated a number of times at the same conditions , we obtain the probability for the turbulent response .",
    "the results for different injection methods and different flow velocities are shown in fig .",
    "[ probabs ] .",
    "it reveals a sharp transition from laminar to turbulent dynamics with decreasing temperature from which we determine the onset values @xmath88 and @xmath61 when the probability is 1/2 . in agreement with the criterion",
    ", we find that @xmath89 .",
    "note that in the case of the ab interface instability , when a small bundle of vortex loops is injected in bulk b - phase , @xmath61 is velocity - independent , as discussed above for bulk superflow .",
    "when the cylinder wall is closely involved in the turbulent processes , then the transition acquires some velocity dependence .",
    "however overall , the transition region is narrow , with the ratio of @xmath60 being around  2 at its boundaries , when measured with a given injection technique .",
    "although the cylinder wall approaches an ideal solid surface , its influence on the dynamics can not be neglected at low mutual friction @xmath90 : the drive from the counterflow reaches its maximum close to the side wall and in addition the self - induced velocity has to be taken into account which arises from the curvature of the vortex end at the attachment point on the wall . thus reconnections with the wall , loop formation , and annihilation become important processes since their influence extends ever deeper into the bulk volume when @xmath91 . in the next two sections we discuss the influence of the boundary on the transition to turbulence and the dependence of @xmath61 on the strength of the flow perturbation .",
    "the remarkable observation from the measurements in fig .  [ probabs ] is that the injection of even a single vortex in the applied flow in a neutron absorption event results in a substantial probability to start turbulence @xcite already at a relatively small @xmath92 .",
    "what is the process responsible for the increase from one single vortex to a number of loops which start interacting and produce turbulence ?",
    "insight in this question is shed by the experiment outlined in fig .",
    "[ multseq ] . here",
    "we start with the equilibrium vortex state at @xmath93 where some vortices are curved and connect to the side wall owing to the residual tilt of the cylinder . at the initial high temperature @xmath94",

    "see the text for details .",
    "( _ b _ ) dependence of the rotation velocity @xmath96 at the instability on the preparation velocity @xmath100 ( symbols ) for the two b - phase sections , separated by the a phase barrier layer .",
    "the lower section is longer and thus the first vortex reconnects to the side wall at higher @xmath96 . both dependencies can be fit to a geometrical model of the vortex cluster @xcite using the residual tilt angle of the cylinder with respect to the rotation axis @xmath101 as a fitting parameter ( lines ) .",
    "the measurements here are performed with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104rad / s .",
    "[ multseq ] ]    the turbulent process consists of two stages",
    ". first during the precursor , the number of vortices @xmath99 increases linearly with time at a rate @xmath105s@xmath106 @xcite .",
    "this slow increase is seen in fig .",
    "[ slowformation ] .",
    "later in the turbulent burst , @xmath99 suddenly increases close to the equilibrium number @xmath107 . from these observations",
    "one concludes that for starting the initial increase in @xmath99 , it is necessary to have a curved vortex , attached to the boundary and moving in the applied flow .",
    "( in contrast , vortex ends on the flat top and bottom walls of the cylinder see approximately zero counterflow and are stable . )    a sketch of this flow - induced single - vortex instability at a solid surface @xcite is presented in fig .  [ wallinstab]a .",
    "if a vortex close to the wall develops a kelvin - wave loop of proper orientation ( i ) , the loop starts to grow in the applied flow ( ii ) .",
    "when the loop reconnects with the boundary , the reconnection event creates a new vortex and induces kelvin waves on the newly formed wall - attached vortex segments ( iii ) . in one of the segments",
    "the kelvin waves will be properly oriented with respect to the counterflow and the loop will start to grow ( iv ) , repeating the process .",
    "thus new vortices are created repeatedly without the need for a specially arranged vortex mill @xcite .",
    "eventually the local density of vortices becomes sufficient to start the turbulent burst .",
    "the main features of the above scenario are supported by numerical simulations , although to reproduce the whole sequence of events in fig .",
    "[ multseq ] turned out to be difficult .",
    "in particular , in fig .  [ wallinstab]b one can see kelvin waves on the side - wall - attached vortex segments after the reconnection of a vortex loop with the boundary . in fig .",
    "[ wallinstab]c a single vortex loop is allowed to expand and reconnect with a flat wall .",
    "the probability to create a new vortex after the reconnection is calculated , averaged over all possible orientations of the original loop . remarkably , this model demonstrates both central messages of this paper .",
    "first , the probability to create a new vortex rapidly grows with decreasing temperature in the range where @xmath108 , demonstrating the transition to turbulence .",
    "second , at still lower temperatures , where @xmath60 approaches @xmath66 , the probability starts to decrease as a result of the decoupling of the superfluid from the reference frame of the wall .    .",
    "by repeating the calculation with arbitrary combinations of @xmath19 and @xmath21 , it is proven that the result depends only on @xmath60 , not on @xmath19 or @xmath21 separately @xcite .",
    "[ wallinstab ] ]      above the transition to turbulence was studied by introducing a perturbation in metastable laminar flow and then observing whether turbulence emerged or not .",
    "similar investigations have been performed in viscous turbulence for the flow in a circular pipe @xcite .",
    "laminar pipe flow is linearly stable which means that a finite - size perturbation is needed to turn it turbulent .",
    "measurements of the amplitudes @xmath109 needed for such a perturbation lead to a scaling law @xmath110 . owing to the quantized nature of vortices in superfluids one might expect that a perturbation of finite amplitude is always required to turn the flow turbulent and thus the interesting question arises whether a scaling law , similar to that of viscous turbulence , might apply . qualitatively a dependence on the amplitude of the perturbation can be checked by comparing different injection methods @xcite and the respective values of @xmath61 .",
    "for example , as seen in fig .",
    "[ probabs ] , injection of @xmath111 - 20 closely packed vortex loops using the ab interface instability results in a higher probability to start turbulence at a given temperature and flow velocity compared to the injection of @xmath112 - 3 vortex rings using neutron absorption .",
    "next we describe systematic measurements of @xmath61 using a method , where the strength of the flow perturbation , expressed as the number of injected vortices @xmath113 , can be continuously adjusted .",
    "this is achieved by varying the initial velocity @xmath86 in the measurement with curved wall - attached vortices in fig .",
    "[ slowformation ] .",
    "a simple geometric model of vortex lines in the tilted cylinder @xcite gives the number of vortex ends attached to the cylindrical wall as @xmath114 . here",
    "@xmath115 is the height of the sample , @xmath116 is the tilt angle with respect to the rotation axis and the term with @xmath117 takes into account the width of the equilibrium vortex - free annulus at the outer cylindrical boundary .",
    "numerical calculations of the equilibrium vortex state in the tilted cylinder give a smaller number for @xmath113 owing to the effects from vortex curvature .",
    "however , in our search for scaling laws we are not concerned with absolute numbers , but only use the dependencies @xmath118 and @xmath119 .     as a function of @xmath86 , which controls the number of curved seed vortices at different values of applied flow @xmath120 .",
    "the filled symbols represent measurements on the shorter top b - phase section , while open symbols refer to the bottom section , see fig .",
    "[ expsetup]a . for the data on the bottom section ,",
    "@xmath86 has been scaled with @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the heights of the two sections .",

    "the line is the power - law fit for the data points . [ scaling ] ]",
    "thus @xmath113 can be controlled by changing @xmath86 and the applied flow velocity with respect to the normal component , @xmath126 , by varying @xmath127 . for each pair of @xmath128",
    "we measure the probability curve @xcite , as in fig .",
    "[ probabs ] , independently for the two b - phase sections and determine their respective onset values @xmath61 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "the transition is seen to move to higher temperatures and smaller @xmath60 when either @xmath86 or @xmath124 is increased . in the same conditions",
    "@xmath61 in the longer bottom section of the sample container is smaller that in the top section . the results from the two sections can be put on the same line assuming proportionality of @xmath113 to @xmath86 and @xmath115 .",
    "this supports the relevance of @xmath113 as a measure of the strength of the perturbation .",
    "it is also understandable why the value of @xmath61 in the bottom section deviates downwards from the common dependence at the lowest @xmath86 .",
    "this is caused by the rim of the orifice in the bottom plate , where vortices become pinned and thus increase @xmath113 .    remarkably , the @xmath129 dependence at all @xmath124 can be fit with the same power law @xmath130 while the prefactor in this fit also scales with @xmath124 ( insert in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] ) .",
    "when @xmath61 is expressed in terms of @xmath113 using the conversion from @xmath86 to @xmath113 given above , the overall scaling becomes @xmath131 .",
    "note that in the previous section we considered the instability of a curved wall - attached vortex in the applied flow to develop independently of other vortices .",
    "the existence of the scaling proves that this view is oversimplified and the transition to turbulence is a collective phenomenon . beyond that , however , the understanding of the measured scaling is missing and its explanation remains a task for future research .",
    "the transition to turbulence in the flow through a circular pipe is one of the classic problems of hydrodynamics . in his pioneering work osborne",
    "reynolds @xcite demonstrated the influence of the entrance to the pipe as well as the quality of his long straight flow channel on the downstream vorticity and turbulence . for superfluid pipe flow technical problems of this kind have not yet been solved . however",
    ", numerical calculations can be performed to study the dynamics in superfluid pipe flow @xcite and to check whether the principles emerging from rotating measurements also apply for linear flow in the pipe .",
    "the first message is that turbulence is suppressed at high temperatures also in pipe flow .",
    "even when a number of vortex loops are introduced in the flow , so that they start interacting and reconnecting , eventually they decay away by annihilating , fig .",
    "[ pipexmpl]a .",
    "the reason is that under the influence of the mutual friction force vortex lines move also transverse to the stream lines across the entire cross section of the pipe and annihilate on the wall , leaving no remnants .",
    "the second message is that at low temperatures the single - vortex instability switches on and this radically changes the dynamics . now",
    "the vortex , when it is driven to the wall across the pipe , does not annihilate totally , but leaves two remnants , which start traversing the pipe cross - section in the opposite direction .",
    "such multiplying processes make it possible even for a single vortex to grow to a turbulent plug of tangled vortices , fig .",

    "the value of @xmath61 is determined as the mid point between two calculations : one proving complete annihilation of all vortex lines at a smaller @xmath60 and a second demonstrating the formation of a turbulent vortex plug at a somewhat higher @xmath60 .",
    "the separation of these two @xmath60 values is depicted with the uncertainty bars . [ pipescaling ] ]",
    "when the superfluid dynamics becomes turbulent at @xmath134 , the assumption about the local polarization of vortex lines , used in deriving equation , starts to be violated .",
    "one way to provide a phenomenological description of turbulent flows on the level of the coarse - grained equations is to supplement with effective friction parameters .",
    "effective friction models , though , do not possess universality : they depend on the type of flow and on the particular physical process considered .",
    "this is similar to how the scattering time of quasiparticles in @xmath0he is often treated : it is not a universal quantity , but depends eg . on whether one considers viscosity , heat conduction , or mutual friction .",
    "so far the most detailed experimental information on effective friction ( or viscosity ) was collected for turbulent energy dissipation processes .",
    "here we describe measurements which allow us to determine simultaneously the effective frictions for energy dissipation and for momentum transfer between the superfluid and its hydrodynamic drive @xcite .",
    "we consider the lowest temperatures where @xmath21 can be ignored and discuss only effective values of @xmath19 .",
    "[ expsetup]b illustrates the emergence of an axially expanding process which ultimately fills the rotating cylinder with rectilinear vortex lines in the equilibrium state of rotation . the most exciting part of this process is a turbulent vortex front @xcite propagating along the entire length of the long cylinder .",
    "the front separates the vortex - free non - rotating superfluid from the rotating superfluid with a bundle of twisted vortex lines @xcite , which we assume to be in approximate solid - body rotation .",
    "thus @xmath4 is forced in a configuration of shear flow axially across the front .",
    "as usual for shear flow , such a configuration is unstable with respect to turbulence . at closer look it becomes obvious that vortices in the front , which terminate on the cylindrical side wall , precess around the cylinder axis at a smaller angular velocity than the twisted vortex bundle behind the front .",
    "this differential motion leads to reconnections , which sustain the turbulence in stationary state while the front is propagating at constant velocity @xmath84 .",
    "the axial velocity @xmath84 of the front is measured using nmr - based time - of - flight techniques and is shown in fig .",
    "[ frontvel ] as a function of temperature and rotation velocity .",
    "one of the characteristics is that @xmath84 saturates in the @xmath135 limit at a @xmath98-independent , but @xmath70-dependent value . since the motion of the front decreases the free energy of the superfluid",
    ", a non - zero @xmath84 means that the turbulence in the front leads to finite energy dissipation even in the zero - temperature limit , in agreement with observations on the free decay of vortex tangles in @xmath0he - b @xcite .",
    "another non - trivial feature of the front velocity is the temperature dependence with a faster variation of @xmath84 in the range @xmath136 , than at higher or lower temperatures .",
    "this feature we call below the shoulder.      the shoulder in fig.[frontvel ] falls in the temperature regime where @xmath137 and the quasiparticle density approaches the collisionless limit . here",
    "momentum exchange of the superfluid component with the normal excitations becomes increasingly weaker and the effects from vortex tension and curvature gain importance in eq .  .",
    "this leads to partial decoupling of the superfluid from the reference frame of the container @xcite .",
    "it means that behind the front the superfuid component rotates at an angular velocity @xmath138 , that is at a rate slower than what solid - body rotation in equilibrium with the cylinder wall requires . in fig .",
    "[ decouple ] measurements of the precession velocity @xmath79 , as derived from the heat released in front propagation at @xmath139 , give a result which is less than half of that of the rotation drive @xmath70 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath140 obtained from direct observations of vortex precession with nmr and from numerical simulations at this temperature .    .",
    "in the region of the front the vortices terminate at the cylindrical side wall .",
    "turbulence is sustained by vortex reconnections which are highlighted with yellow dots .",
    "the front moves upward into the vortex - free region .",
    "the plot on the left shows measurements of the axial front velocity ( circles ) as a function of temperature and angular velocity @xmath70 of the cylinder .",
    "the lines are fit to the model eq .   with parameters @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",
    "[ frontvel ] ]    to account for the decoupling , one considers the angular momentum balance for the propagating front in eq .  , where @xmath33 appears since @xmath145 and @xmath31 owing to the vortex twist .",
    "in addition @xmath19 has to be replaced by an effective value for angular momentum @xmath146 . for the energy balance , which in the laminar regime was expressed as @xmath147 ,",
    "one then recovers a generalized expression with @xmath70 replaced by @xmath79 and @xmath19 by a distinct effective value for the energy dissipation @xmath148 .",
    "the combined model is @xcite @xmath149 we assume a simple linear relation of the effective friction parameters with @xmath150 : @xmath151 and @xmath152 , with @xmath153-independent phenomenological parameters @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "this model provides a good fit to the experiment in fig .",
    "[ frontvel ] and reproduces the main qualitative features of @xmath84 including the shoulder .",

    "[ decouple ] .",
    "the systematic deviation of the model from the experimental data in the range ( 0.25  0.35)@xmath158 in fig .",
    "[ frontvel ] may be caused by an oversimplified treatment of the angular momentum balance in the turbulent front which does not yet include all contributions considered for the laminar front @xcite .",
    "an important message is conveyed by the residual values for @xmath143 and @xmath159 , which describe the @xmath160 contribution to effective friction from turbulence and possibly from surface friction .",
    "when energy dissipation is considered , turbulence dramatically enhances effective friction , owing to the turbulent energy cascade , which leads to substantial dissipation even in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "the minute value of @xmath157 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath155 , attests that quantum turbulence does not efficiently increase momentum exchange with the normal component and the container . as a result ,",
    "a new class of hydrodynamic phenomena becomes prominent owing to superfluid decoupling at temperatures where @xmath161 and @xmath162 .     and reaches the end of the sample cylinder at @xmath163s , when the measured power is at the maximum .",
    "the square - wave model ( blue curve ) assumes the superfluid component to reach the equilibrium vortex state immediately behind the front .",
    "in fact , owing to its partial decoupling from the container rotation , the superfluid component comes to equilibrium much later , as the fitted analysis of the measured record shows ( green curve ) .",
    "it proves that the vortex density behind the front corresponds to only @xmath164 , while the rest of the vortices are supplied mostly by laminar motion well after the front propagation has already stopped .",
    "the insert shows the rotation velocity @xmath79 of the superfluid behind the front as a function of temperature ( normalized to the velocity @xmath70 of the rotation drive ) .",
    "@xmath79 is determined from an analysis of the thermal signal in the main plot , from oscillating nmr signals @xcite , and from direct measurements of the number of vortices behind the front at higher temperatures @xcite ( filled symbols ) .",
    "results from numerical simulations on front motion are shown with empty circles .",
    "the line represents the model in eq .   with the same parameter values as in fig .",
    "[ frontvel ] at @xmath165rad / s .",
    "[ decouple ] ]    the difference in the contribution from quantum turbulence to energy dissipation and to momentum exchange with the normal component may originate in the damping properties of the kelvin waves , emitted from vortex reconnections .",
    "this is illustrated numerically in a simple model system of two vortex rings , reconnecting in the presence of mutual friction damping @xcite , fig .",
    "[ recrings ] . the damping causes a continuous decrease of the total energy and momentum of the system . after",
    "the reconnection kelvin waves are excited and the oscillating motion causes substantial extra energy dissipation , while the rate of momentum change is essentially not affected by the reconnection event .",
    "the explanation is that the direction of the mutual friction force alternates in the two half - periods of the oscillation .",
    "thus momentum transfer to the normal component cancels out .",
    "simultaneously the direction of the vortex velocity is also alternating , but it remains opposite to the mutual friction force .",
    "thus the work done by mutual friction in the two half - periods of the oscillation adds up . since reconnections and the fluctuating vortex motion are the characteristic features of quantum - turbulent flows , this conclusion is likely to apply to quantum turbulence in general .",
    "the normal component can be considered not to participate in the motion if @xmath166 in the hydrodynamic regime while in the ballistic regime the diffusive scattering of thermal quasiparticles from the walls should dominate the scattering from vortices .",
    "these conditions are generally realized in superfluid @xmath0he but may also be applicable to superfluid @xmath73he in the low - temperature range .",
    "when the normal component is stationary and surface pinning or friction can be ignored , the motion of the superfluid component is characterized by three dimensionless parameters : @xmath66 , @xmath60 and their ratio .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 describes the transition from vortex - free or single - vortex dynamics at @xmath167 to collective dynamics with many vortices at @xmath168 .",
    "the latter condition is required for quantum turbulence .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 has the same physical meaning as the reynolds number in classical turbulence .",
    "when mutual friction is large and @xmath169 , turbulent motion is damped .",
    "one might think that by placing a sufficiently dense vortex tangle in high - velocity flow , one could observe turbulent motion even at high temperatures . in reality when @xmath19 is large , vortex lines move across the flow , i.e. towards the wall . if they annihilate at the wall without leaving remnants behind , which is the case at an ideal wall and small @xmath60 , then all vortices eventually disappear . with decreasing temperature , i.e.  increasing @xmath60",
    ", vortices start to move with the flow , which allows more time for interactions and reconnections . in this regime also the single - vortex instability at the wall @xcite becomes an effective mechanism for the formation of new loops .",
    "experimentally one can distinguish between the formation of new vortices in the bulk - volume or in surface - mediated processes since the latter switch on at slightly lower temperatures .",
    "but overall both types of processes contribute to the transition from laminar to turbulent superfluid dynamics at @xmath108 .",
    "the value of @xmath60 at the transition depends on the type of flow and scales with the magnitude of the flow perturbation . in some cases laminar flow",
    "can be exceptionally stable , like in the spin - down of a cylindrical container to rest . here a large perturbation , like tilting the sample cylinder by @xmath170 from the rotation axis , is needed to turn the flow turbulent even at @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to classical fluids , where the spin - down to rest is one of the most unstable flows @xcite .",
    "the difference is caused by the different mechanisms of coupling of the fluid to the container : in classical fluids it is a surface effect , mediated by boundary layers , while in superfluids it is a volume effect ( in the absence of surface pinning or friction ) , mediated by the normal component .    , momentum @xmath172 , and angular momentum @xmath173 , normalized to their respective values at @xmath174 .",
    "the calculation demonstrates quite different behavior in energy and momentum loss after the reconnection event .",
    "no externally applied flow is present .",
    "[ recrings ] ]    the implications from this coupling in low - temperature superfluid dynamics have been understood only recently .",
    "it is by now well established that quantum turbulence turns a superfluid to a dissipative liquid , by providing intrinsic mechanisms for energy loss via the turbulent energy cascade .",
    "in contrast , no such intrinsic mechanism exists for momentum exchange with the normal component / container / drive , if extrinsic mechanisms such as surface friction and pinning are excluded . with respect to momentum coupling and drag , a superfluid filled with a vortex tangle continues to behave like an almost ideal liquid and no boundary layer , similar to that in classical turbulence , is formed .",
    "this duality in coupling mechanisms has profound implications on the low - temperature dynamics , when @xmath175 .",
    "in particular , the rapidly decreasing momentum coupling leaves a characteristic anomaly in the overall energy dissipation rate , as demonstrated by the shoulder in the measured front velocity @xmath176 in fig .",
    "[ frontvel ] .",
    "the anomaly falls in the temperature range where another interesting phenomenon is expected to become important , the crossover in the turbulent energy cascade from the quasi - classical cascade at length scales exceeding the inter - vortex distance to the kelvin - wave cascade at smaller scales .",
    "the problem of joining the two energy cascades of different nature across the crossover region @xcite , dubbed the bottleneck problem , has still no universally accepted theoretical resolution .",
    "the mutual - friction - determined termination point of the energy cascade traverses the crossover region in the temperature range where @xmath177 @xcite or @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "this is not very different from the range where decoupling becomes important owing to the rapid variation of @xmath179 .",
    "it is thus not trivial to distinguish the two effects experimentally .",
    "in fact , the shoulder in the front velocity was originally interpereted as an indication of the bottleneck @xcite , and only newer direct measurements of @xmath79 allowed to understand that decoupling is the main source of this anomaly .",
    "an open question is whether the systematic deviation of the front velocity from the decoupling model in the range ( 0.25  0.35)@xmath158 in fig .  [ frontvel ] may provide new information on the bottleneck .",
    "a further consequence from the decreasing momentum coupling at low temperatures is the increased importance of laminar flow in the low - friction region , where all dynamics was earlier expected to be turbulent .",
    "for example in the thermal measurement of the front propagation in fig .",
    "[ decouple ] only about 40% of the energy is released by the turbulent process and the rest comes as slow laminar tail .",
    "the reason is that in laminar flow the decoupling problem does not appear , as both energy dissipation and momentum transfer are determined by the same mutual friction parameter @xmath19 .",
    "an interesting question is to what extent the decoupling phenomena are applicable to quantum turbulence in superfluid @xmath73he , where usually complicated experimental geometries and the pinning of vortices at the sample boundaries facilitate the coupling of the superfluid to the container .",
    "simultaneously , however , much bigger values of @xmath60 can be achieved in @xmath73he compared to @xmath0he which in principle increases the role of decoupling .",
    "suppression of the decoupling by pinning might be not complete for the following reasons : first , the pinning force is limited by vortex tension @xmath180 .",
    "this limit has been experimentally observed in spin - up of @xmath73he in rough - wall containers @xcite .",
    "second , it has been demonstrated that a vortex in @xmath73he can slide relatively easily along the wall by continuously reconnecting from one pinned vortex to another @xcite .",
    "thus it may be worth to consider whether the decoupling affects the interpretation of experiments in superfluid @xmath73he .",
    "one example is the measurements of spin - down of a cubic container filled with superfluid @xmath73he @xcite . here",
    "the anomaly in the temperature dependence of the effective turbulent viscosity @xmath181 was observed , in a way similar to the shoulder in the front velocity @xmath84 in our experiments .",
    "the current explanation of this effect is linked to the physics of the crossover region in the turbulent energy cascades @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the decrease of @xmath181 is observed in the temperature region where @xmath182 and thus the influence of the decoupling can not be a priori excluded .",
    "the superfluid decoupling is most pronounced in flows where the momentum transfer from the drive to the superfluid is unidirectional .",
    "the opposite extreme is quantum turbulence generated with various oscillating objects @xcite , currently the most popular technique for studying the free decay of turbulent vortex tangles @xcite . here the direction of momentum transfer is continuously alternating , with the average being close to zero . in this case",
    "the decoupling phenomena are masked .",
    "the recently developed floppy vibrating wire @xcite , which can be used in an oscillating mode or in a steady - motion mode , might provide a new tool to study the decoupling phenomenon , provided that surface - friction effects can be kept under control .",
