    "the corresponding mean value is @xmath9 .",
    "[ eq : maxwellian ] is generally a good approximation and is independent of mass of the bodies involved in the encounter , provided that the cluster is not mass segregated and that the star cluster s velocity distribution is isotropic . for an encounter with impact parameter @xmath10 , the velocity at periastron can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hyperbolic eccentricity .",
    "the distribution of impact parameters follows @xmath13 .",

    "the histograms in figure  [ figure : incomingvelocity ] show the distributions of @xmath5 ( _ top _ ) and @xmath20 ( _ bottom _ ) for the various types of encounters that occur in star cluster models  3 ( _ left - hand panels _ ) and  5 ( _ right - hand panels _ ) , and the corresponding best fits to eqs .",
    "[ eq : maxwellian ] and  [ eq : maxwellianoffset ] .",
    "the curves represent the distributions integrated over all locations in the star clusters , for their entire evolution .",

    "[ eq : maxwellian ] and  [ eq : maxwellianoffset ] are approximations .",
    "nevertheless , since most encounters occur within the first @xmath21  myr , the approximations are reasonable .",
    "the strongest deviations from the maxwellian distribution are seen for the largest values of @xmath5 and @xmath20 , indicating interactions in the centre of the star cluster , and for the smallest values of @xmath5 and @xmath20 , indicating encounters in the cluster outskirts and during the latest phases of the evolution when the stellar density is low . since planetary systems",
    "have @xmath22 , the corresponding curves for the p - p encounters are very similar in all four panels , and well - fitted by eq .",
    "[ eq : maxwellian ] .",
    "all encounters involving planets ( p - p , s - p , ss - p , and p - p ) are qualitatively very similar , both for model  3 and model  5 . as a result of gravitational focusing , the typical velocity at periastron increases as the total mass of the encounters increases",
    ".    with respect to the maxwellian fit , excess s - s interactions with small @xmath5 occur .",
    "these interactions are most frequent in the low - density regions in the outskirts of the clusters and also at late stages of evolution , when the effect of gravitational focusing on low - velocity stars is more prominent .",
    "the deviation from a maxwellian distribution is much stronger for the ss - s interactions . since model  3 does not have primordial binaries , all binaries involved in the ss - s encounters are formed through capture .",
    "as these binaries are generally formed in the cluster centre , and as their components are generally of high mass , eq .  [ eq : maxwellian ] does not provide a good approximation for the distribution .",
    "since @xmath23 for model  5 , the effect of gravitational focusing and longevity of the binary population is now much better visible .",
    "the ss - s and ss - ss show deviations from the maxwell - bolzmann distributions , because of gravitational focusing and because they tend to remain longer in the star cluster .",
    "note that the dynamically - formed binary systems in model  3 have on average substantially larger @xmath20 than the primordial binaries in model  5 , although they are fewer in number . as these dynamical binaries in model  3 are generally more massive than the primordial binaries in model  5 , their encounters with other stars and ffps are stronger , and therefore their periastron velocities are larger .",

    "[ eq : maxwellian ] , or from low - number statistics .",
    "most encounters occur during the early phase of star cluster evolution when mass segregation is small , and during this period we expect @xmath8 to be directly proportional to the velocity dispersion of the star cluster ( eq .  [ eq : velocitydispersion ] ) . for star cluster members near the half - mass radius @xmath24 .",
    "this trend is clearly seen for most fits to @xmath6 plotted in figure  [ figure : vpfit ] , and is independent of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the type of encounters .",
    "since the p - p encounters have @xmath27 , we obtain the same relation for @xmath16 . for the encounters between massive components the fitted values for @xmath8",
    "are larger , and @xmath8 typically increases with increasing component masses .",
    "since ffps barely change their velocities during p - p encounters , we expect @xmath28 .",
    "the scatter for the p - p interactions results from the fact that we have fitted the distributions @xmath6 and @xmath16 to all encounters integrated over the entire volume of the star cluster and its entire evolution .",
    "the value of @xmath17 depends only mildly on @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath25 and @xmath31 .",
    "as the fitted value @xmath8 takes into account the dependency of @xmath16 on @xmath5 , the value of @xmath17 is primarily determined by the mass of the encountering components . since",
    "gravitational focusing is stronger for encounters between massive bodies , the fitted value @xmath32 increases with the combined mass of the members involved in the encounter .",
    "the fitting results for @xmath16 are combined in figure  [ figure : vpvcfit ] .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is primarily determined by the velocity dispersion of the star cluster , while @xmath17 is mostly determined by combined mass of the encountering bodies .",
    "these trends are seen in figure  [ figure : vpvcfit ] : models with identical velocity dispersion lie roughly on vertical lines , while the same types of encounters ( s - s , s - p , etc ) lie roughly on a horizontal line .",
    "apart from some scatter , the values of @xmath17 of most of the encounter types indeed lie roughly on a horizontal line in figure  [ figure : vpfit ] , although there is a trend of @xmath17 increasing with @xmath8 ( and therefore with increasing @xmath30 ) .",

    "[ eq : periastrondistribution ] .",
    "this overabundance is exclusively seen for encounters involving single stars ( s - s , s - p , and s - ss ) in model  5 , and is related to the evolution of primordial binary systems , their interactions with other star cluster members , and subsequent decay .",
    "figure  [ figure : pfit ] shows the fitted values of @xmath60 ( eq .  [ eq : periastrondistribution ] ) for all models . since the vast majority of the p - p encounters are weak , the fitted value for @xmath60 is close to the predicted value in the unfocused limit , @xmath68  au@xmath61 , although the scatter around this value is considerable , particularly for the low - density star clusters for which a large fraction of the ffps escape immediately .",
    "larger masses for the encountering bodies generally result in smaller values of @xmath60 , which is consistent with the increased gravitational focusing .",
    "in addition , when the star cluster mass increases and/or its radius decreases , the velocity dispersion ( and hence @xmath5 ) becomes larger , such that gravitational focusing is less important and the measured values of @xmath60 are larger .",

    "* for further analysis ) .",
    "free - floating planets ( ffps ) may be abundant in young star clusters , as close encounters between stars can destabilise planetary systems , which can result in direct or delayed ejection of planets from their host planetary systems . in this article",
    "we have presented a study of the dynamical evolution of ffp populations in various types of star clusters .",
    "we have carried out @xmath0-body simulations to characterise how the ffp population evolves and we have studied the properties of close ( @xmath2  au ) encounters between single stars , binary stars , and ffps .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows :    1 .   a certain fraction of the ffps escape from their star clusters shortly after they are ejected from their host stars , while the remaining ffps escape at much later times .",
    "beyond the time of early escape , the planet - to - star ratio decreases linearly with time , and the times @xmath72 and @xmath73 at which respectively half of the stars and planets escape from the star clusters are related through the simple relation @xmath74 . for individual planets with low ejection velocities this means that they are likely to escape from the star cluster at a 40% earlier time than their host star .",
    "2 .   many ffps ejected from their host star system at early times experience tens of close ( @xmath2  au ) encounters with other stars and ffps in the star cluster before escaping from the cluster .",
    "the fraction of ffps that leave the cluster without any close encounter increases with increasing initial velocity distribution and with decreasing stellar density .",
    "typically half of the encounters of all types occur within 30  myr , while only 10% of the encounters occur after the first 100  myr .",
    "the ratios of the timescales at which half of the number of star - star , star - planet , and planet - planet encounters occur are @xmath75 .",
    "the velocity - at - infinity distributions , @xmath6 , of the encounters are well approximated with maxwell - boltzmann distributions .",
    "the periastron velocity distributions for all types of encounters are well fitted by distributions @xmath76 similar to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , with a velocity offset @xmath17 .",
    "the most frequent velocity @xmath8 in this distribution is proportional to the velocity dispersion of the star cluster , and the offset @xmath17 is primarily determined by the combined mass of the encountering bodies of a certain type .",
    "the distribution over periastron distances is linear , @xmath77 for the encounters is linear over most of the values of @xmath53 . in our case",
    "we have recorded all approaches within @xmath64  au . in that case ,",
    "distant encounters have @xmath78  au@xmath61 and @xmath79  au@xmath4 . in the case of close encounters , @xmath66 , where @xmath59 is the total number of encounters and",
    "@xmath80 is the close encounter limit .",
    "also when we combine the encounters for the entire life of the star clusters , the linear fit is good , except for very small distances ( @xmath81  au ) , for which approaches are more common .    our study is intended to obtain a general overview of the dynamical evolution of a ffp population in star clusters .",
    "we have made several assumptions that should be kept in mind when making realistic predictions for existing star clusters , or when interpreting observational data .",
    "first , a critical assumption we made is that the ffp space density is identical to the stellar density . in reality",
    ", the ejection velocities of ffps may depend in an intricate way on the position and velocity of the star at the moment when it is perturbed .",
    "this is especially the case when planets are ejected promptly after their host system experiences a close encounter .",
    "one would then expect planets to be preferably ejected when their host star is near the star cluster centre . in the case of delayed ejection , however , this may well be a good approximation , since the stars are well - mixed at the moment of planet ejection .",
    "second , in our initial model setup we have also made the crude assumption that all planets are initially free - floating .",
    "we also neglect any additional ffps produced by the close encounters between stars in our model , as well as the possible capture of ffps by planetary systems .",
    "although these is an unrealistic assumptions , particularly in the case of perturbed planetary systems that may eject planets tens of millions of years later ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is a good approximation if most planet ejections occur at early times .",
    "moreover , many of the analytical and computational results presented in section  [ section : results ] are easily scalable to any value of @xmath26 .",
    "these can therefore also be used to evaluate the probabilities for close encounters and escape for individual planets ( @xmath82 ) . when convolved with an time - dependent ffp production rate",
    ", estimates for the dynamical behaviour of the entire population of ffp can subsequently be obtained .    in a follow - up study",
    "we will analyse more realistic initial conditions , ideally by modelling the full @xmath0-body evolution of decaying multi - planet systems in young star clusters , potentially using the amuse framework @xcite , specifically , we will analyse the dynamical evolution of a ffp population where the ffps have a stronger preference to be generated in the cluster centre , and where they are ejected at appropriate times resulting from close encounters with other cluster members and the decay of perturbed multi - planet systems .",

    "<S> instabilities in planetary systems can result in the ejection of planets from their host system , resulting in free - floating planets ( ffps ) . </S>",
    "<S> if this occurs in a star cluster , the ffp may remain bound to the star cluster for some time and interact with the other cluster members until it is ejected . here , we use @xmath0-body simulations to characterise close star - planet and planet - planet encounters and the dynamical fate of the ffp population in star clusters containing @xmath1 single or binary star members . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ffps ejected from their planetary system at low velocities typically leave the star cluster 40% earlier than their host stars , and experience tens of close ( @xmath2  au ) encounters with other stars and planets before they escape . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of ffps that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and the initial velocity distribution of the ffps . </S>",
    "<S> approximately half of the close encounters occur within the first 30  myr , and only 10% occur after 100  myr . </S>",
    "<S> the periastron velocity distribution for all encounters is well - described by a modified maxwell - bolzmann distribution , and the periastron distance distribution is linear over almost the entire range of distances considered , and flattens off for very close encounters due to strong gravitational focusing . </S>",
    "<S> close encounters with ffps can perturb existing planetary systems and their debris structures , and they can result in re - capture of ffps . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , these ffp populations may be observed in young star clusters in imaging surveys ; a comparison between observations and dynamical predictions may provide clues to the early phases of stellar and planetary dynamics in star clusters .    </S>",
