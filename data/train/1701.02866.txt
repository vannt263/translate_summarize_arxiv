    "among several possible models , we focus on the loop currents ( phase cc-@xmath55 @xcite ) for which the out - of - plane moment is directly related by an anapole or toroidal moment , within each @xmath3 plaquette ( fig.1.c ) . the anapole @xmath56 points along the diagonal within the plane and defines the loop current state in any given cuo@xmath2 layer . there are four different loop current states , which are obtained by @xmath57-rotation @xcite of @xmath58 .",
    "these loops produce orbital magnetic moment at ( @xmath59,@xmath59 ) or ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) within the cuo@xmath2 plane ( fig .",
    "these four equivalent configurations exhibit indistinguishable structure factors at bragg positions ( 1,0,l ) or ( 0,1,l ) where the iuc magnetic order has been observed @xcite .",

    "as it exists four possible states for each plane , it then yields to 16 possible configurations of the lcs for a bilayer system . whatever is the lc state in a given plane",

    "another choice of @xmath63 will give rise to another 4 patterns which will belong to each of the category discussed above .",
    "the magnetic intensity is proportional to the square of the magnetic structure factor @xmath66 @xcite . for the lc model considered here",
    ", that corresponds to the out - of - plane magnetic intensity , @xmath67 , measuring the orbital moment pointing along c*.    we now estimate @xmath49 for the 4 configurations of fig .",
    "4 . for the two first categories of fig .  4 , @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath68 ( for the in - phase or parallel moments configuration ) , or proportional to @xmath69 ( for the out - of - phase or antiparallel moments configuration ) .",

    "it is clear from these expressions that another choice of @xmath63 in the lower layer will give rise to the same magnetic intensity for each of the category as it will only change the sign of @xmath74 .",
