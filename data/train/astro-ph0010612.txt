    "the hickson-16 galaxy group ( or hcg-16 ) comprises seven galaxies with a mean recession velocity ( ribeiro et al .",
    "@xcite ) of 3959@xmath066 km  s@xmath1 and a velocity dispersion of 86@xmath055  km  s@xmath1 , centered on the position @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the four central members of the group , originally identified by hickson ( hickson @xcite ) , all fall within the 30  field of view of epic , they all show evidence for mergers and a strong ionising continuum ; they have well resolved optical nuclei ( mendes de oliveira et al .  1998 ) . however the nature of the ionising continuum is unclear .",
    "optical emission line diagnostics ( de carvalho & coziol @xcite , veilleux & osterbrock @xcite ) suggest that in ngc 838 and ngc 835 there is a starburst nucleus , whilst in ngc 835 , ngc833 and ngc 839 there is a low ionisation narrow emission line region ( or liner 2 nucleus ) .",
    "this could arise either from an agn or from starburst activity : [ oiii]/h@xmath4 values for the nuclei are all @xmath5 ( de carvalho & coziol @xcite ) .",
    "the epic instrument is able to observe directly the ionising continuum , and distinguish clearly between optically thin thermal emission from a starburst , and non - thermal hard x - ray emission from an agn .",
    "these observations can therefore be used to determine the nature of the ionising continuum , helping to clarify the relationship between mergers , the triggering of starbursts , and the creation and fueling of black holes .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observatory ( jansen et al .",
    "@xcite ) has three x - ray telescopes of area @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 , with the three epic instruments at the foci ; two of the epic imaging spectrometers use mos ccds ( turner et al .",
    "@xcite , holland et al .",
    "@xcite ) and one uses a pn ccd ( strder et al .",
    "the observations of the hcg-16 galaxy group were taken in orbit-23 as part of the _ xmm - newton _  epic first - light . exposures of 50  ksec were taken with epic ( sensitive from 0.2 to 10 kev ) and 1  ksec exposures were taken in v ( 550 nm ) and uv ( 280 nm ) with the xmm - newton optical / uv monitor ( om ) telescope ( mason et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the epic data were processed using the pipeline scripts emchain ( mos ) and epchain ( pn ) .",
    "screening was applied using the _ xmm - newton_sas ( science analysis software ) .",
    "hot and bad pixels and negative e3 events were removed from the data to reduce the level of electronic noise .",
    "a low energy cut of 200  ev was applied to the data .",
    "the first 10 ksec of data were also removed from the epic observation , as this contained a high count - rate background particle flare .",
    "the resultant exposure time for each of the detectors was @xmath840  ksec .",
    "figure 1 shows the resultant epic x - ray colour image of the centre of the hcg-16 field .",
    "the hard , absorbed , spectrum of the agn in ngc 833 shows up as a blue point source , and the soft starburst emission in the outer regions of ngc 835 shows as a red halo ; the other galaxies show extended x - ray discs .",
    "figure 2 also shows the v - uv colour image from the om .",
    "the nuclear regions of ngc 835 and ngc 838 show up brightly in the ultraviolet , indicative of hot stars or gas associated with enhanced star formation .",
    "there are also bright uv knots in the outer regions of ngc 835 showing enhanced star formation there .",
    "a close - up om image of ngc 835 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "since epic resolves the optical disks of the galaxies , the spectra were prepared from photons falling within a region of interest based on the x - ray image . for ngc 833",
    "the x - ray source is point - like , while for ngc 835 the core and the surrounding region ( the red halo in figure 1 ) were analysed separately , the spectra of the remaining galaxies were made using the entire x - ray disc .",
    "background spectra were taken from source - free regions on the central epic - mos and pn chips ; the background spectra were normalised to the area of the source extraction regions .",
    "the background subtracted epic spectra were fitted , using xspec v11.0 , with the latest response matrices produced by the epic team ; the systematic level of uncertainty is @xmath9% .",
    "finally spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin , in order to apply the @xmath10 minimisation technique .",
    "all subsequent errors are quoted to 90% confidence ( @xmath11 for 2 interesting parameters ) .",
    "values of @xmath12  kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 and @xmath13 have been assumed and all fit parameters are given in the rest - frame of the hcg-16 system .",
    "we now present the individual epic spectra of the 4 main hickson-16 galaxies .",
    "optical imaging data on ngc 833 reveal a disturbed velocity field and pronounced misalignment of the kinematic and stellar axes , indicative of an ongoing interaction ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "the emission lines present in the optical spectra ( de carvalho & coziol @xcite ) indicate weak non - stellar liner-2 activity in the core ; there is no optical evidence for current star formation ( [ nii]/h@xmath4@xmath8unity ) .",
    "the epic image of this galaxy is point - like , much smaller than the stellar disc .",
    "the best - fitting epic x - ray spectrum ( figure 4 ) shows three distinct components , all required at @xmath14% confidence .",
    "the most obvious is the peak at high energies from an obscured agn ; this emission is in the form of a power - law of index @xmath15 , absorbed by material of column density equal to @xmath16  @xmath17 .",
    "the second component is an un - absorbed power - law , resulting from radiation scattered into our line of sight , by thin , hot , plasma directly illuminated by the agn .",
    "the third component is radiation from an optically - thin thermal plasma , with a temperature of @xmath18  ev .",
    "the improvement in the fit upon adding the thermal emission is @xmath19 .",
    "a summary of the fits to ngc 833 ( and the other 3 galaxies ) are given in table 1 .",
    "this complex x - ray spectrum amply confirms the presence of an agn in ngc 833 of luminosity @xmath20  erg  s@xmath1 , it is , remarkably , the dominant source of power in the galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the thermal x - ray emission , is more than 100 times weaker ( @xmath21  erg  s@xmath1 ) and the fir luminosity ( verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "@xcite ) is also very low ( @xmath22  erg  s@xmath1 ) .      the adjacent galaxy , ngc 835 is undergoing a gravitational interaction with its neighbour ngc 833 , as evidenced by the tidal tails in the optical image ; and apparently contiguous stellar discs ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "the velocity field is normal , but there is emission line evidence ( de carvalho & coziol @xcite ) for liner nuclear activity , and for current starburst activity in the outer regions ; the knotted ring structure seen in the om image supports this .    the x - ray emission from ngc 835 can be spatially separated into two areas , the core , and an outer region corresponding to the remainder of the stellar disc .",
    "the core has a very similar spectrum ( fig .",
    "5 ) to that of ngc 833 . there are absorbed and scattered power - laws indicating a heavily obscured agn ( @xmath23  @xmath17 ) of luminosity @xmath24  erg  s@xmath1 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) , but the soft thermal component is more luminous than ngc 833 at @xmath25  erg  s@xmath1 ; it is almost certainly from current starburst activity and the fir luminosity ( verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "@xcite ) is 100 times larger at @xmath26  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "the spectrum at the periphery of ngc 835 is purely thermal , with a temperature of 300 ev and a luminosity of @xmath27  erg  s@xmath1 , similar to that of the core .",
    "this is the x - ray emission from the starburst region including the ring structure and knots seen in the om v - uv image .    to summarize",
    ", the epic data clearly show the presence of an agn , in both ngc 833 and ngc 835 , that coexists with present starburst activity in the core ( and for ngc 835 in the periphery ) of the galaxies .",
    "the detections of the obscured agn and thermal starburst components in both galaxies are highly significant , at @xmath14% confidence ( see table 1 ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      ngc 838 is an ongoing merger with strong starburst activity .",
    "optical data ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "@xcite ) show kinematic warping , and multiple velocity components in the ionised gas , and a double optical core ( also see de carvalho & coziol @xcite ) .",
    "the infrared luminosity is @xmath28  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "the epic spectrum of ngc 838 ( fig .",
    "6 ) shows purely thermal emission , the disc is resolved in x - rays , but there is no separate sharp core in the x - ray image .",
    "the spectrum is fitted with a two temperature thermal spectrum ( @xmath29  kev and @xmath30  ev ) and the luminosity is high at @xmath31  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is all consistent with the optical data : the soft x - ray emission is from the ionised gas produced in the starburst while the hard thermal spectrum could be characteristic of unresolved x - ray binaries .",
    "there is no statistically significant scattered or obscured power law ; the upper limit for the agn luminosity is @xmath32  erg  s@xmath1 , assuming an absorbing column of @xmath33  @xmath17 .",
    "ngc 839 may also be a recent merger ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "@xcite , de carvalho & coziol @xcite ) , it has a double nucleus in the optical , a fir luminosity of @xmath34  erg  s@xmath1 , and a disturbed velocity field ; optical lines indicate an active liner-2 nucleus ( de carvalho & coziol @xcite ) . in the soft x - ray epic spectrum ( fig .",
    "7 ) there is optically - thin thermal emission , similar to that of the other galaxies , of temperature @xmath35  ev , and luminosity @xmath36  erg  s@xmath1 ; a typical indicator of a current starburst .",
    "the spectrum also shows an obscured agn , as found in ngc 835 & ngc 833 ; it is however much less luminous ( @xmath37  erg  s@xmath1 ) for a column of @xmath38  @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly the abundances in ngc 839 appear to be higher than solar .",
    "there are apparent weak lyman-@xmath39 lines of o , mg and si in the epic spectrum , although the significance of these features is low ( at only 90% confidence ) .",
    "fitting the soft x - ray spectrum with the mekal model does however yield an over - abundance of 5.2@xmath02.0 times the solar value .",
    "one interesting possibility is that the heavier elements have been enriched through the intense starburst activity in this galaxy .",
    "direct x - ray spectroscopy is the best way to identify hidden agn in galaxies , and here the epic cameras on xmm - newton have produced clear evidence for active , massive black holes in three out of four galaxies in hcg-16 .",
    "the presence of a similar active nucleus in ngc 838 is unlikely , unless it is very heavily absorbed .",
    "the nature of the ionising continuum in the four galaxies has been elucidated : there is thermal emission from starburst activity in three , ( possibly four ) of the galaxies , and in three of them there is a coexisting active black hole . while liner-1 galaxies with broad h@xmath4 lines do harbour black holes ( terashima et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) this is the first _",
    "direct _ evidence that black holes power liner2 galaxies .",
    "these agn are at the low end of the luminosity scale , consistent with their small size ( magorrian et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in ngc 833 , the accreting black hole x - ray luminosity arguably exceeds the fir luminosity .",
    "this is very unusual , even compared with much more luminous agn , and may indicate the stripping of dust and gas by past interactions with other galaxies ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the epic x - ray study of this nearby and evolved system of small galaxies indicates a high fraction of active black holes coexisting with starbursts .",
    "this is consistent with optical studies of compact groups ( e.g. coziol et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where a large fraction of galaxies with nuclear activity is found . the observations may also provide a link between normal galaxies , where black holes may be inactive , and seyfert galaxies and quasars , where black holes dominate , and where galaxy mergers may be implicated in the onset of black hole activity ( boyce et al .",
    "@xcite , bahcall et al .",
    "further observations with xmm - newton have the potential to determine more precisely the fraction of nearby galaxies that harbour active , low - luminosity black holes .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "epic was developed by the epic consortium led by the principal investigator , dr .",
    "m. j. l. turner .",
    "the consortium comprises the following institutes : university of leicester , university of birmingham , ( uk ) ; cea / saclay , ias orsay , cesr toulouse , ( france ) ; iaap tuebingen , mpe garching , ( germany ) ; ifc milan , itesre bologna , oapa palermo , ( italy ) .",
    "epic is funded by : pparc , cea , cnes , dlr and asi .",
    "finally we thank the referee , reinaldo de carvalho , for his report , and for some useful comments and suggestions ."
