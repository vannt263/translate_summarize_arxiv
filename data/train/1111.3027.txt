    "the possibility of extended topological objects in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , e.g. z(3 ) interfaces arising from spontaneous breaking of z(3 ) symmetry , has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that there are also topological string defects in qgp forming at the junctions of z(3 ) walls @xcite .",
    "formation and evolution of these objects in the initial transition to the qgp phase has been studied in the context of relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments ( rhice ) @xcite .",
    "certain consequences of z(3 ) walls for baryon inhomogeneity generation in the universe have also been explored @xcite .",
    "investigation of these objects is important not only for probing the very rich vacuum structure of the qcd in the deconfining phase , but also because these provide the only example of topological defects in a relativistic quantum field theory which can be probed in laboratory conditions , namely , the relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments ( rhice ) .",
    "the existence of these objects has been questioned in the literature , especially in the presence of quarks @xcite . however , there are recent lattice studies by deka et al .",
    "@xcite of qcd with quarks which have attempted to directly probe the existence of different z(3 ) vacua .",
    "these results show strong possibility of the existence of non - trivial , metastable , z(3 ) vacua for high temperatures .",
    "the exact value of the temperature , above which these metastable z(3 ) vacua are seen , is not important .",
    "what is important is that these vacua seem to exist as metastable thermodynamic phases of qcd in the deconfining regime , and hence associated topological objects will necessarily arise in any realistic phase transition from the confining phase to the qgp phase .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate an interesting possibility arising from the existence of z(3 ) interfaces .",
    "we will study reflection of quarks and antiquarks from z(3 ) walls and show the existence of cp violation arising from the z(3 ) walls .",
    "this cp violation is spontaneous , arising due to the background configuration of the gauge field corresponding to the z(3 ) wall , and was first demonstrated by altes et al .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of the universe , that due to the non - trivial background field configuration for the standard model gauge fields , the localization of quarks and antiquarks on the wall is different .",
    "its possible effects on the electroweak baryogenesis via sphalerons was discussed in @xcite .",
    "same possibility of spontaneous cp violation for the case of qcd was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "we extend these studies by calculating the propagation of quarks and antiquarks across the z(3 ) walls and show that they have different reflection coefficients .",
    "for this we calculate the profile of the order parameter @xmath6 between different z(3 ) vacua @xcite using the the effective potential for the polyakov loop , as proposed by pisarski @xcite .",
    "we then obtain obtain the profile of the background gauge field @xmath7 from this @xmath6 profile .",
    "this @xmath7 configuration provides a potential for the propagation of quark causing non - trivial reflection of quarks from the wall .",
    "it is important to know the uncertainties in the determination of the @xmath7 profile depending on the choice of the specific form of the effective potential , such as those given in @xcite . to address this issue",
    "we repeat the above calculation for another choice of effective potential of the polyakov loop as provided by fukushima @xcite .",
    "we find that , even though the two effective potentials ( in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) are of qualitatively different shapes , the resulting wall profile and @xmath7 profile are surprisingly similar .",
    "this gives us confidence in the use of our procedure to calculate the reflection of quark and antiquarks from the z(3 ) interfaces .",
    "different values of the reflection coefficients of quarks and antiquarks from the z(3 ) walls will have very interesting implications for the case of rhice and for the early universe .",
    "here we mention that in the earlier studies by some of us the reflection of quarks / antiquarks from z(3 ) walls ( in the context of rhice and the universe ) @xcite , was studied by modeling the dependence of effective quark mass on the magnitude of the polyakov loop , and no possibility of spontaneous cp violation was explored .",
    "this cp violation , resulting in different reflection coefficients of quarks and antiquarks from z(3 ) walls , will lead to segregation of quarks and anti - quarks due to motion ( collapse ) of walls . as a result there will be selective concentration of baryon ( or antibaryon ) number in different regions , depending on the z(3 )",
    "vacua involved .",
    "this will have direct observable consequences for the relativistic heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "for example , it will affect the yield of baryons and mesons , enhancing baryon multiplicities and suppressing meson multiplicities .",
    "as we will see , these effects are expected to be important for heavy quarks , especially for charm and heavier flavors .",
    "a detailed analysis of these effects is planned for a future work .",
    "this cp violation can also play an important role in the context of early universe , especially for generation of baryon density inhomogeneities , by segregating baryons and antibaryons .",
    "we mention here that our analysis of reflection of quarks in this paper utilizes z(3 ) wall profile of pure su(3 ) gauge theory , without dynamical quarks .",
    "the effects of quarks may not be important in the context of rhice due to small length and time scales involved , but for the case of universe these effects will be of crucial importance .",
    "we will discuss this further below .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "ii we discus the basic physics of the origin of spontaneous cp violation due to the presence of z(3 ) interfaces @xcite and discuss the effective potential for the polyakov loop , as proposed by pisarski @xcite for calculating various quantities . in section iii , we discuss how to obtain the profile of the background gauge field @xmath7 from the profile of the order parameter @xmath6 between different z(3 ) vacua @xcite . in section",
    "iv we address the issue of uncertainties in the determination of the @xmath7 profile depending on the choice of the specific form of the effective potential by repeating the calculations of section iii for the effective potential of the polyakov loop provided by fukushima @xcite . the resulting wall profile and @xmath7 profile",
    "are found to be very close to those found in section iii .",
    "we use the profile of @xmath7 as calculated in section iii , for the dirac equation ( in the minkowski space ) in section v to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for quarks and antiquarks .",
    "section vi presents our results and conclusions are discussed in section vii .",
    "we first discuss the basic physics of the origin of the spontaneous cp violation from the existence of z(3 ) walls . for the case of pure @xmath8 gauge theory ,",
    "we start with the definition of the polyakov loop , @xcite    @xmath9 , \\label{eq : lx}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath10 are the gauge fields and @xmath11 are the generators of @xmath12 in the fundamental representation . @xmath13 denotes the path ordering in the euclidean time @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the gauge coupling . under global @xmath16 symmetry transformation",
    ", the polyakov loop transforms as @xmath17 here , @xmath18 ; @xmath19 .    thermal average of the polyakov loop , @xmath20 , is the order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "( from now onwards , we will use @xmath21 to denote @xmath20 , ) it is related to the free energy of a test quark in a pure gluonic medium ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 implies finite free energy of a test quark and hence , the deconfined phase ( i.e the system is above the critical temperature @xmath24 ) .",
    "this leads to spontaneous breaking of @xmath16 symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath25 implies infinite free energy of a test quark and hence , confined phase ( i.e. system is below @xmath24 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 symmetry is then restored .",
    "the @xmath26-fold degeneracy of the ground state implies the existence of interfaces between regions of different @xmath27 vacua . for qcd ,",
    "the gauge group is the color group @xmath28 .",
    "it has three @xmath27 vacua resulting from the spontaneous breaking of @xmath27 symmetry in the high temperature ( deconfined ) phase characterized by , @xmath29 as we mentioned above , there have been questions whether these z(3 ) domains have some physical meaning or not @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of quarks raises further issues as they do not respect the @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "it has been argued that it is possible to interpret the effect of addition of quarks as the explicit breaking of @xmath16 symmetry and lifting of degeneracy of the vacuum @xcite , and we will follow this approach . further ,",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , recent lattice qcd studies with quarks @xcite have strengthened the physical basis for the existence of these different z(3 ) vacua .",
    "the metastability of non - trivial @xmath27 vacua will have important implications for rhice and the early universe .",
    "however , for the rest of the paper we will consider the pure gauge case for calculating the @xmath27 interface profiles .",
    "this is because our main objective here is to show the interesting possibility of spontaneous cp violation in the reflection of quarks and antiquarks from z(3 ) walls which is independent of the explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "we will briefly comment on the effects of quarks in the last section , detailed study of these effects will be presented in a future work .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", different @xmath27 vacua have interpolating @xmath3 profile leading to z(3 ) interfaces .",
    "this essentially means that there is a background gauge field @xmath30 profile which interpolates between different @xmath27 vacua .",
    "the quarks / anti - quarks moving across the @xmath27 domain walls will behave differently in the presence of a given spatially varying @xmath2 field configuration . as a result",
    ", we should have different reflection and transmission coefficient for quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "this is the source of cp violation .",
    "the origin of this cp asymmetry is spontaneous in nature .",
    "the earlier studies @xcite of this spontaneous cp violation arising from z(3 ) walls focused on the localized solution of dirac equation ( in euclidean space ) , and it was shown that if a wave function for a fermion species localizes , then it s cp conjugate does nt . the whole discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite was within the euclidean formalism and the exact gauge field profile was not determined in these investigations .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the calculation of reflection and transmission coefficient of quarks and anti - quarks and hence , in the propagating solutions .",
    "it is important to note here that the background gauge field profile comes from the finite temperature field theory , which is formulated in the euclidean space . to calculate the reflection and the transmission coefficients ( or to study propagation of quarks , in general ) , we need to solve dirac equation in the minkowski space .",
    "we start with the dirac equation in the euclidean space , with the spatial dependence of @xmath7 calculated from z(3 ) wall profile as mentioned above .",
    "then we do the analytic continuation of the full equation to the minkowski space and use the resulting equation to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "we should mention here that it may seem puzzling that we are extracting information about colored objects ( i.e. @xmath7 ) starting with a colorless object , the polyakov loop .",
    "however , as we will explain later in section v , starting with a given profile of @xmath21 , one does not get unique solution for @xmath31 and the ambiguity about color information manifests itself in the form of a set of solutions of @xmath7 .",
    "we will use the effective model for the polyakov loop as proposed by pisarski @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density has the form @xmath32 @xmath33 for our case ( i.e qcd ) .",
    "@xmath34 is multiplied with the first term to give the correct dimensions to the kinetic term .",
    "@xmath35 is the potential term that has the form    @xmath36    the cubic term in @xmath3 in the above potential , when written in terms of @xmath37 , gives rise to @xmath38 term that leads to three degenerate @xmath27 vacua when @xmath39 ( i.e. when @xmath40 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in the potential , are fixed in ref @xcite by comparing with lattice results for the pressure and energy density for pure su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath41 is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 with @xmath46 mev .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( the factor 47.5/16 for @xmath49 is to account for the additional quark degrees of freedom compared to pure su(3 ) case ) . with the above values , @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath6 and other quantities are normalized as follows , @xmath52 so that @xmath53 as @xmath51 .",
    "the normalized quantities are then used in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : pispot ] ) , which is then used to calculate the @xmath6 profile using energy minimization , see ref.@xcite for details .",
    "fig.1 shows the plot of @xmath54 for the interface between two different vacua ( in the absence of quarks all the three interfaces have same profile for @xmath54 ) .",
    "we mention that the surface tension @xmath55 of the z(3 ) walls was estimated in refs.@xcite for the above effective potential and it was found that @xmath56 0.34 , 2.62 , and 7 gev/@xmath57 for @xmath58 200 , 300 , and 400 mev respectively .",

    "mev the @xmath61 result for @xmath55 in ref.@xcite is larger by almost factor 10 than the lattice result of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the values of @xmath55 for larger temperatures , @xmath62 = 300 and 400 mev are in reasonable agreement with the analytical estimates @xcite ( which give @xmath63 for large temperatures ) .     between different @xmath27 vacua for @xmath64 mev and @xmath65 mev respectively , as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "note that at higher temperature , the wall thickness is smaller , as expected.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    the energy minimization program gives the full profile for @xmath67 which is then used for calculating @xmath68 as described in the next section .",
    "( as we mentioned in the introduction , we will also consider another form of effective potential as provided by fukushima @xcite in section iv . )",
    "in this section we calculate the @xmath2 profile form @xmath3 profile by inverting eqn.([eq : lx ] ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we choose @xmath2 to be of the form @xmath69 where , @xmath15 is the coupling constant and @xmath62 is the temperature , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the diagonal gell - mann matrices .",
    "coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 depend only on spatial coordinates .",
    "the advantage of taking this gauge choice is that we are dealing with the eigenvalues of the matrices that are invariant under gauge transformation .",
    "we take @xmath7 to be independent of @xmath14 .",
    "this is for simplicity .",
    "further , it can be justified in the high temperature limit due to periodic boundary conditions on @xmath7 in the ( euclidean ) time direction in the imaginary time formalism being used here for finite temperature field theory .",
    "substituting eqn.([eq : a0diag ] ) in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : lx ] ) , we get    @xmath74    where , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . on comparing the real and imaginary part of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : lsimplify ] ) , we get    @xmath78    [ eq : lgrp ]    here @xmath79 is defined by writing @xmath80 . in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : lx ] ) , @xmath2 appears in the phase , so any increment in the phase by a factor of type @xmath81 will result in the same value of @xmath6 .",
    "we first consider the above equations for @xmath82 vacuum .",
    "note that @xmath83 for finite temperatures .",
    "however , we will keep referring to the three z(3 ) vacua as @xmath84 .",
    "the solutions are a set of ordered pairs @xmath85 .",
    "these different solution sets reflect @xmath81 ambiguity in @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , we find the solution sets @xmath86 corresponding to the @xmath87 vacuum .",
    "one now needs to find the appropriate values of @xmath88 for the entire profile of @xmath21 interpolating between these two vacua .",
    "one ambiguity in this is obvious .",
    "it may appear that any of the sets @xmath85 could be matched to any of the sets @xmath86 as all sets for a given vacua are equivalent .",
    "however , this could lead to different @xmath7 profiles in between , which in turn would lead to different reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "this problem is resolved when we realize that the variation of @xmath2 should be smooth across the domain wall .",
    "thus , we can simply start with any one pair @xmath85 , and set it as the initial condition for the generation of the profile of @xmath7 as one traverses the wall starting from @xmath82 vacuum to @xmath89 vacuum .",
    "we only require that @xmath72 and @xmath73 vary smoothly as the profile of @xmath21 changes smoothly across the wall .",
    "it will then automatically lead to the appropriate values of @xmath86 as @xmath90 vacuum is approached .",
    "for the results shown here we had taken the initial values of @xmath91 for the @xmath92 vacuum ( in a region far left to the interface ) .",
    "as one approaches the interface , say , along the z axis , new value of @xmath21 is selected from the profile of @xmath21 ( calculated from the energy minimization program ) .",
    "we then take small range of values near the original @xmath91 and @xmath93 was then calculated for all these values .",
    "those values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 were selected for which the error between the calculated @xmath94 and @xmath94 obtained by energy minimization was minimum .",
    "the process was then repeated for each value of @xmath66 to obtain @xmath95 values .",
    "comparison between the calculated @xmath96 profile and the one obtained by energy minimization is given in figure ( [ fig : lcalplt]a ) .",
    "it clearly shows that this technique works well .",
    "figure ( [ fig : lcalplt]b ) shows profile of parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 across the domain wall .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "this cp violation will have interesting observable consequences for the relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at rhic and at lhc . if qgp is formed in these experiments ( and there are strong indications of that ) , then various @xmath27 domains will inevitably be formed , leading to the formation of z(3 ) walls .",
    "( we mention that the qgp strings @xcite which also necessarily form during transition to qgp phase should also lead to spontaneous cp violation .",
    "its effects on quark / antiquarks scattering , or possible localization on the qgp strings needs to be explored ) .",
    "as these domain walls move / collapse , quarks / anti - quarks will get reflected / transmitted differently from these domain walls leading to the segregation of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the concentration of quarks ( or antiquarks , depending on the collapsing vacuum ) will grow in different regions of the qgp . as the effects would be stronger for heavier quarks ( table [ tab : refquarks ] ) , this should lead to enhancement of strange and charmed baryons along with the suppression in the yield of corresponding mesons ( such as @xmath97 ) .",
    "detailed exploration of the formation and evolution of z(3 ) walls and qgp strings in the context of rhice has been carried out in ref .",
    "these simulations show that in the typical region of qgp formed in rhice , one expects several z(3 ) domain walls to form , their numbers ranging from 1 to 4,5 .",
    "the walls may extend throughout the qgp region with size of order 10 fm .",
    "there are closed domain walls formed with initial size of about 5 - 8 fm .",
    "the velocities of these walls was also estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite and were found to range from 0.5 to 0.8 . for detailed discussion of the properties of z(3 ) wall and qgp string networks expected in rhice ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "these results about the sizes and numbers of z(3 ) walls and qgp strings are very important .",
    "this is because one should realize that in a very large sized qgp region , as in the early universe , for every domain wall connecting @xmath98 and @xmath99 vacua , there will be one connecting @xmath98 and @xmath100 vacua .",
    "these walls are conjugate of each other and the reflection of a quark from the first wall is identical to the reflection of an antiquark from the second wall .",
    "these two walls are strictly degenerate , even in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking effects from dynamical quarks .",
    "thus , on the average there will not be any bias for quarks and antiquarks as they scatter from a network of z(3 ) walls .",
    "this is , however , not true for a small qgp region as produced in rhice . as the number of z(3 )",
    "walls produced in such a small region is of order one @xcite , there may be a net effect for the concentration of baryon number , or for anti - baryon , in each event",
    ". this can be revealed by event - by - event analysis .",
    "even statistically , for a large number of events , one can calculate the variance of baryon number density , and spontaneous cp violation from z(3 ) walls may be detected . for a given event also",
    ", segregation of baryons and antibaryons will occur over large distances of order several fm as indicated by the typical wall size and separation @xcite .",
    "this cp violation can also be very important in the context of early universe where it can have interesting implications for generation of baryon inhomogeneities . as collapsing domain walls preferentially sweep quarks ( or antiquarks ) , segregation of quarks and antiquarks will occur .",
    "one can then discuss the formation of baryonic ( or antibaryonic ) lumps .",
    "these baryon inhomogeneities can be of large magnitude , with large separations in the context of certain low energy inflationary models @xcite , ( but now with cp violation incorporated ) .",
    "we will present a detailed study of this in a future work .",
    "another important consequence will be on the @xmath101 spectra of hadrons .",
    "the quarks / anti - quarks with high momenta will undergo non - trivial scattering from these z(3 ) walls . as @xmath27 walls collapse , some get transmitted while others are reflected back . for @xmath27 walls forming",
    "closed , collapsing , structures , the quarks suffer multiple reflections inside the wall , resulting in an increment in their transverse momenta .",
    "this process continues until the walls either melt away or collapse completely .",
    "so the final transverse momentum of some quarks may be reasonably enhanced before they escape .",
    "one can then use a specific model ( such as recombination / coalescence model ) to study the @xmath101 spectra of final state hadrons , which should show an increase in the yield of hadrons at high @xmath101 .",
    "this has been discussed in ref.@xcite , however , no account of cp violation was considered in that work . in the presence of cp violation",
    ", the modified @xmath102 spectra will be different for quarks and for antiquarks .",
    "we plan to carry out these analyses in a future work .",
    "the most important limitation of our analysis is the absence of quark effects .",
    "dynamical quarks will lead to lifting of degeneracy between different z(3 ) vacua , making @xmath82 vacuum as the true vacuum as discussed in refs .",
    "the one - loop corrections from dynamical quarks have also been discussed in refs.@xcite . as we mentioned , recent lattice studies @xcite have provided evidence for the existence of such metastable z(3 ) vacua .",
    "our analysis above of calculation of @xmath7 profile and calculation of reflection coefficients for quarks and antiquarks can be straightforwardly applied for this non - degenerate case and work is underway on this . apart from affecting the numbers ( for reflection coefficients )",
    ", its most important effect will be on the evolution of z(3 ) wall and qgp string network , ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed simulation study of these aspects ) .",
    "however , for the case of rhice , due to small length ( and time ) scales involved , the dynamics of z(3 ) walls is likely to remain dominated by the surface tension effects with the difference in pressure between different vacua not playing dominant role for such length scales ) .",
    "thus the above mentioned features of effects on hadron spectra due to cp violation may remain qualitatively true for rhice .    however , for the universe the entire issue of formation and evolution of z(3 ) walls crucially depends on the importance of quark effects .",
    "some discussion of this has been provided in @xcite and we plan to investigate these issues in future in detail .",
    "most important issue will be to see whether the spontaneous violation of cp discussed here can lead to a net separation of baryons and antibaryons in the universe which will have observational consequences ( e.g. from the strongly constrained nucleosynthesis , which can be used to constrain various parameters of the model . )",
