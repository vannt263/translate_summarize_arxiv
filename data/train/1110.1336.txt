    "however , only in humans social intelligence is also used on a higher level . among all species ,",
    "only we have evolved the ability to discuss ( and debate ) future problems and opportunities , and formulate long - term policy .",
    "recent media reports have pointed out that a central function of the political opinion formation process , the debunking of counter - factual opinions , may be starting to fail ( see @xcite for an example from u.s .",
    "politics ) .    in the political discourse",
    "our opinions are exposed to close scrutiny and criticism .",
    "well - founded criticism may cause us to change counter - factual beliefs and thus promote rational decision making .",
    "however , because of the stresses involved , humans tend to favor discussing with others who share similar beliefs .    with the increasing diversity of offline and online media @xcite and new media technologies @xcite , it is becoming easier to avoid opposing opinions altogether .",
    "in particular , the internet enables people not only to access but also to publish information easily .",
    "one of the best examples is perhaps the micro - blogging service twitter , which currently is approaching @xmath0 user posts per week . among this flood of information ,",
    "it is easy to find sources supporting almost every conceivable opinion , while avoiding contradicting evidence .",
    "it thus seems likely that situations develop where a given subset of the society ( and the media by which it is represented ) pay attention only to information sources with the same belief system , thus reinforcing and perpetuating myths that are never confronted with opposing views . in this light",
    ", one may ask whether we are heading for a society that is fractionated into groups adhering to internally consistent but mutually exclusive belief systems .",
    "the question when fragmentation in opinion formation processes can occur on a social scale is beyond the scope of classical social research , because it focuses on an emergent phenomenon that may require new conceptual approaches from physics .",
    "a minimal yet paradigmatic physical model of opinion formation is the voter model @xcite .",
    "it describes a network of nodes representing agents , and links representing the social contacts among them .",
    "the agents hold one of two possible opinions , which they can change by adopting the opinion of their topological neighbors . due to its similarity to interacting spin models , the voter model has attracted considerable attention in the physics literature and has been studied using different interaction geometries , such as regular lattices or heterogeneous networks @xcite .",
    "an important extension of the voter model is achieved by including homophily , the agents propensity to discard links to opposing neighbors and establish new links to agents holding the same opinion @xcite .",
    "thus , the interaction network is not static but co - evolves with the agent dynamics , as the agents rewire their links depending on their opinions .",
    "such networks , in which the node and link dynamics co - evolve , are called adaptive networks @xcite .",
    "the long - term dynamics of the adaptive voter model can reach one of two absorbing states : a _ consensus state _ , in which all agents hold the same opinion , or a _ fragmented state _ , in which the network breaks into at least two components , which are internally in consensus .",
    "the adaptive voter model therefore provides a simple framework in which the fragmentation of opinion formation processes can be studied @xcite . in this model",
    ", fragmentation occurs in a phase transition that has been identified as a generic absorbing transition @xcite .",
    "it can be computed analytically using a recently proposed motif expansion approach @xcite .",
    "the adaptive voter model has been studied so far on undirected networks . in the context of opinion formation ,",
    "however , the underlying interactions are often asymmetric .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to encode `` who pays attention to whom '' as directed links in the interaction network .",
    "directed links were considered in previous studies on static networks @xcite , but directed adaptive networks have only been investigated in a generic threshold model for boolean networks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate voter dynamics in a directed adaptive network , in which both the opinion dynamics and the topological change are influenced by the directionality of the interactions .",
    "the agents can avoid disagreeing with neighbors by rewiring their outgoing links , whereas they can not affect their incoming links .",
    "the overall network topology thus changes adaptively , while the out - degree of each agent , i.e. , its number of outgoing links remains unchanged .",
    "this enables us to study the influence of different realistic out - degree distributions .    for sufficiently dense poissonian out - degree distributions ,",
    "fragmentation occurs if the rewiring of network connections exceeds a critical rate , which is consistent with previous results on undirected networks @xcite .",
    "however , for scale - free out - degree distributions and poissonian distributions with small mean degree , we find that fragmentation can already be observed at much lower rewiring rates than in undirected networks . we show that this behavior is due to the nodes of low out - degree , which can form self - stabilizing topological structures that nucleate fragmentation .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath1 nodes representing agents and @xmath2 directed links representing social contacts .",
    "each node @xmath3 holds a binary opinion @xmath4 .",
    "the direction of links indicates the flow of attention between the agents . in other words , in our notation",
    "we draw links in the direction that one would draw the `` follows''-links on twitter .",
    "we initialize the network as a random directed graph with randomly assigned equiprobable strategies .",
    "the node states and the network topology are then left to evolve according to the following rules : in sequential updates , a link @xmath5 is picked at random from the network . if @xmath6 , the link is said to be _ inert _ and nothing happens .",
    "otherwise , the link is said to be _ active _ , and it is either rewired ( probability @xmath7 ) , or an opinion update takes place ( probability @xmath8 ) . in the former case ,",
    "the node @xmath3 cuts the link and reconnects to a random node @xmath9 with @xmath10 . in the latter case",
    ", node @xmath3 switches its opinion @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the rewiring of links changes only the in - degree distribution , whereas the out - degree distribution and the average degree @xmath13 of the network remain fixed .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of the voter model on static directed networks , we do not need to restrict our model to networks consisting of a single strongly connected component @xcite , because the network s component structure is affected by the ongoing rewiring of links , which continuously forms and re - routes paths between different strongly connected components .",
    "below , we study the proposed model in terms of the density @xmath14 of @xmath15-nodes ( corresponding to agents holding opinion a ) and the per - capita densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 of active links , @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] . following @xcite",
    "we characterize the state of the network by the magnetization @xmath20 and the active link density @xmath21",
    ".    in network simulations of the directed adaptive voter model one observes qualitatively different types of trajectories : first at sufficiently high rewiring rates the network rapidly approaches a fragmented state ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , in which the network breaks into at least two components , which are internally in consensus .",
    "second , for sufficiently low rewiring rates the network initially approaches a stationary active state ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , in which the opinions and the topology change continually . because such active states form a parabola in the @xmath26-@xmath27-plane , the system can drift randomly along the parabola until an absorbing consensus state ( @xmath28 , @xmath23 ) is reached .",
    "these dynamics are closely reminiscent of the adaptive voter model on undirected networks @xcite .",
    "in addition to the trajectories described above , the directed model can show a third type of behavior not observed in the undirected case . here",
    ", the systems drifts along the parabola of active states for some time and then collapses slowly to the fragmented state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : traj - lu ] ) .",
    "this can lead to fragmentation significantly below the critical rewiring rate found in undirected networks .",
    "the delayed fragmentation after the drift along the parabola of active states suggests that in the active state the network undergoes some slow reorganization that eventually leads to the destabilization of the active states . in the following we investigate the nature of this reorganization and its implications for network fragmentation",

    "the main goal of this paper is exploring the impact of directionality of attention on the opinion formation process . for this purpose",
    "we compare the dynamics of the directed adaptive voter model to well known results for the undirected adaptive voter model . in the following we refer to these two models simply as the _ directed model _ and the _ undirected model _ , respectively .",
    "a direct comparison of different models is often difficult and may lead to misleading results .",
    "we therefore compare simulation results of the directed model to two analytical approximations that are known to capture the dynamics of the undirected model in different limits . in this comparison",
    "an agreement between analytical and numerical results indicates that the assumptions made for the undirected model are still valid in the directed model , whereas a disagreement points to new physics in the directed model that is not observed in the undirected model .",

    "a node copies a neighbor s opinion via one of its outgoing active links , transforming it into an inert link .",
    "this also affects all other links connected to the focal node , transforming active links into inert ones and vice versa .",
    "the resulting indirect change in the density of active links is accounted for by the triplet variables .",
    "the time evolution of the density of @xmath34 links , @xmath17 , is determined by the analogous equation @xmath41 - 2[\\mathrm{a}{\\ensuremath{\\mspace{-2mu}{\\leftarrow}\\mspace{-2mu}}}{\\mathrm{{\\ensuremath{b{\\ensuremath{\\mspace{-2mu}{\\rightarrow}\\mspace{-2mu}}}a } } } } ] \\\\    + [ \\mathrm{a}{\\ensuremath{\\mspace{-2mu}{\\leftarrow}\\mspace{-2mu}}}{\\mathrm{{\\ensuremath{a{\\ensuremath{\\mspace{-2mu}{\\rightarrow}\\mspace{-2mu}}}b } } } } ] - [ { \\mathrm{{\\ensuremath{b{\\ensuremath{\\mspace{-2mu}{\\rightarrow}\\mspace{-2mu}}}a}}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mspace{-2mu}{\\rightarrow}\\mspace{-2mu}}}\\mathrm{b } ] - h \\bigr\\}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    equations   do not constitute a closed ordinary differential equation ( ode ) system , as they involve the triplet moments @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] . in principle , the equation system could be complemented by similar equations for the triplet moments .",

    "will be greater than the number of neighbors that oppose the focal agent s opinion , because the rewiring dynamics transforms active links into inert ones .",

    "in particular , it can lead to the formation of small clusters that have few outgoing links and hence have a very high resistance to invasion of the opposing opinion . in an extreme case",
    "small subgraphs can form in which all nodes are in consensus and all outgoing links starting within the subgraph lead to other nodes in the same subgraph .",
    "such structures are attracting components of the network , which can be entered by following a directed path but never left due to the lack of outgoing links .",

    "the system therefore approaches the parabola of active states , which is in agreement with results from the undirected model and the analytical approximations for the directed model . however , while the system drifts along the parabola of active states , self - stabilizing structures are eventually formed due to the ongoing rewiring .",
    "as the self - stabilizing structures grow , the permissible range for the magnetization shrinks , effectively arresting @xmath27 as almost all nodes are recruited into the self - stabilizing structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stable - components ] ) . because the last nodes to join the structures are `` hub '' nodes with high out - degree , a relatively high density of active links can be maintained for some time .",
    "because the hub nodes undergo rapid opinion switches , rewiring can only slowly separate them from opposing neighbors , which explains the slow fragmentation .",
    "the switching and rewiring of the hub nodes are clearly visible in the time series of the active link density @xmath26 . in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj - lu ] , this is shown for the last @xmath127 time units before fragmentation . here",
    ", one of the two remaining connecting hubs detaches from one of the components and the final hub still switches several times before eventually also separating .    summarizing the observations above",
    ", we conjecture that early fragmentation is initiated by the formation of self - stabilizing structures among nodes of low out degree .",
    "we emphasize that contrary to most dynamical phenomena observed in scale - free networks , the dynamics of interest is generated primarily in the nodes of low degree .",
    "nodes of high degree still play an important role as they are the last nodes to connect the separating components and thus determine the time of fragmentation .",
    "this mechanism is not captured by current analytical approaches , because it relies on the build - up of negative correlations between the in - degree and out - degree of nodes that is neglected in previously proposed approximation schemes .",
    "because the mechanism postulated above relies on the formation of correlations , one can perform a simple test by considering a system in which these correlations are removed by an additional rewiring process .",
    "however , such a test is difficult in scale - free networks for two reasons : first , because of the constraints in scale - free topology it is well - known that it is difficult to remove correlations in scale - free networks completely , and second , because of the presence of nodes of very high degree , fragmentation takes a long time , making numerical studies of fragmentation tedious .",
    "our reasoning above predicts that early fragmentation should be observed also in directed poissonian networks with sufficiently low mean degree . in the present section",
    "we therefore consider a poissonian network with a mean degree of 4 , which avoids the difficulties encountered in scale - free networks . in this section",
    "we show ( a ) that this network exhibits early fragmentation and ( b ) that the early fragmentation can be avoided by an additional rewiring mechanism that destroys the correlations implicated in the formation of self - stabilizing structures .",
    "fragmentation of networks with poissonian out - degree distribution and low @xmath52 , in which the inert links are also rewired ( squares ) or are not rewired ( circles ) .",
    "early fragmentation is clearly visible , although the shown averages over 100 simulation runs are still rather noisy due to the highly stochastic nature of early fragmentation .",
    "shown are the absolute value of the magnetization ( top ) , the proportion of fragmenting simulation runs ( middle ) , and the correlation coefficient between the in- and out - degree of the nodes in the final state ( bottom ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath32 , @xmath29 , and @xmath128.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    simulation results for the network described above are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - mu4-inert ] .",
    "the figure shows clear evidence of fragmentation well below the estimated fragmentation point .",
    "further , this early fragmentation is accompanied by the build - up of negative correlations between the in- and out- degrees of the nodes .",
    "this confirms our previous observation that attention focuses on those nodes who pay little attention to others themselves , as we have also seen in the scale - free case in fig .",
    "[ fig : degrees ] .    to verify that the correlation described above is the cause and not a symptom of the early fragmentation",
    ", we now consider a different variant of the model .",
    "this variant is identical to the model used so far , except that when an inert link is chosen , this link is also rewired to a randomly chosen target node that is in the same state as the source .    the model variant in which the rewiring of inert links is switched on shows no evidence for early fragmentation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - mu4-inert ] ) .",
    "fragmentation occurs in a relatively sharp transition at a critical rewiring rate @xmath89 that is consistent with the estimate from the motif expansion .",
    "we emphasize that the rewiring of inert links neither introduces nor destroys active links .",
    "it therefore has no _ direct _ impact on fragmentation .",
    "however , rewiring inert links prevents the build - up of correlation between the in - degree and the out - degree of nodes and thereby inhibits the formation of self - stabilizing structures .",
    "the absence of early fragmentation in a model where these correlations are removed confirms the causal relationships postulated above .",
    "we therefore conclude that in directed adaptive networks the slow build - up of negative correlations between in - degree and out - degree can initiate early fragmentation by leading to the formation of self - stabilizing structures .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated an extension of the voter model on adaptive networks that takes the directionality of the interactions among the agents into account .",
    "we found that our model can transition to a fractionated state for rewiring rates that lie much below the critical value estimated using analytical approaches known to work well in undirected models .",
    "we discovered that fragmentation occurs due to a novel mechanism that depends inherently on the directed nature of the links .",
    "this _ early fragmentation _ occurs when agents focus their attention on those who are steady in their opinion because they pay attention only to few sources of information . in this case self - stabilizing structures can form that nucleate fragmentation .",
    "our results illustrate that directed networks can exhibit new physics not observed in their undirected counterparts . especially in the investigation of opinion formation processes ,",
    "the often directed flow of attention should therefore be taken into account in models .    in the context of",
    "real - world opinion formation processes the mechanism described here may constitute a threat but also an opportunity . early fragmentation maintains diversity of opinions , it may thus aid the survival of counter - factual myths , but also of legitimate and well - founded views of minorities .",
    "it is conceivable that this mechanism may be employed in the future to adjust the perceived degree of controversy in controlled environments .",
    "for instance , in online discussion boards or music recommendation systems the underlying software can in principle control which posts are displayed to whom .",
    "it could thus encourage rewiring of attention that either facilitates or inhibits early fragmentation .",
    "even the adaptive directed voter model paints a highly simplified picture of real - world opinion formation processes and thus must be considered as a toy model .",
    "therefore , investigation of more realistic models is an important goal for the future .",
    "based on the results and analysis presented in the present paper we believe that the mechanism of early fragmentation will be observed whenever directed attention is focused preferentially on agents that change their opinions at less than average rate . we therefore expect that early fragmentation should be robust to future refinements of the model .    a key ingredient that is missing in our present model is novelty .",
    "here we considered only the exchange of opinions regarding a single well defined question , whereas in reality many discussions are enriched by the constant inflow of new ideas .",
    "we have shown that homophily favors connecting to poorly informed agents and thereby promotes early fragmentation , whereas curiosity would favor connecting to well informed agents and thereby hinder early fragmentation . in this light , novelty , whether in the form of true innovation or arbitrarily changing fashions may play an important role in preventing social fragmentation .",
