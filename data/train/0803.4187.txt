    "small clusters of particles suspended in a fluid occur in many forms , from nanoparticles @xcite , quantum dots@xcite and colloidal suspensions @xcite to biomolecules such as globular proteins @xcite .",
    "such nanoclusters have a variety of applications , from material coatings to drug delivery by hollow clusters .",
    "both the individual behaviour of nanosized particles@xcite as well as their collective behaviour , such as the increased heat conductance in dilute suspensions of nanoparticles ( so - called nanofluids)@xcite , have received considerable attention@xcite .    for the purpose of studying small length scale and short time classical transport phenomena which occur in nanosystems , a green s function approach was introduced by kincaid@xcite .",
    "this approach has the promise of being able , in principle , to describe transport phenomena on all time and length scales , unlike hydrodynamics .",
    "the main idea of the theory is to describe the evolution of fluid properties such as its energy , momentum and number density in terms of green s functions .",
    "the application of these green s functions to nanosystems and systems where time scales at picoseconds or less are important , has been an area of some interest@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the green s functions were expanded around a gaussian distribution plus an infinite series of corrections , a finite truncation of which yielded excellent agreement with simulations .",
    "even just the gaussian itself was found to be a reasonable approximation to the green s functions .",
    "an explanation for this could be that the series of corrections has fast convergence , but at that point , it was not known why that this could be the case . since the gaussian description is much simpler than the full green s function , one would like to know when fast convergence occurs and when taking the gaussian approximation suffices . a preliminary answer to this question",
    "was found in ref . , namely , that for the motion of a single particle in an equilibrium pure lennard - jones ( lj ) fluid , the gaussian approximation can be used up to time scales of the order of a picosecond .",
    "one of the applications of the green s function approach is mass transport in liquids and liquid mixtures . for that case ,",
    "the green s functions are essentially the probability distribution functions of displacements ( in a time @xmath0 ) of single particles of the different components @xcite .",
    "thus it is not too surprising that the green s functions can be expressed in terms of the cumulants of this distribution .",
    "these cumulants measure the correlations of the displacement of a single particle , in particular , they measure the departure of the correlations from gaussian behaviour .",
    "as will be discussed in more detail below , a recent theorem regarding these cumulants implies that when the green s functions are expanded around a gaussian distribution , the correction terms to the gaussian term are proportional to increasing powers of @xmath0 for short ( initial ) times @xmath0@xcite .",
    "analytic expressions for the coefficients in front of the powers of @xmath0 were also derived in ref .. the values of the first two numerical coefficients are here of particular interest , because they can be computed numerically and , as show in sec.[sec : eq ] can then be used to find estimates of the physical time scales below which the expansion of the green s function around the gaussian term yields useful results , as appeared to be the case in refs .. numerical values for these coefficients will be presented in this paper for various equilibrium lj - based systems , including nanoparticles in a suspension of lj particles",
    ". we will present the resulting orders of magnitude of the relevant time scales on which the first few terms in the series decrease .",
    "non - equilibrium systems will be studied in future work .",
    "three systems were studied , namely a pure lj fluid , an isotopic binary mixture of lj particles ( in which context the study of short time displacements arose@xcite ) , and a suspension of nanoparticles in a lj fluid .    in the isotopic binary lj mixtures , there are @xmath1 particles of mass @xmath2 and @xmath3 particles of mass @xmath4 in a box of size @xmath5 , such that the number density is @xmath6 . for the pure lj fluid ,",
    "one sets @xmath7 .",
    "the positions and velocities of the particles will be denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , where @xmath10 or @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a particle index , which runs from 1 to @xmath1 if @xmath10 and from 1 to @xmath3 if @xmath13 . by definition , in an isotopic mixture all pair interaction potentials are the same for all components , but their masses are different .",
    "the inter - atomic potential between the particles is the lj potential @xmath14 , \\label{vlj}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the distance between two particles , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the same for all pairs of particles .",
    "all quantities reported are in lj units : length in units of @xmath16 , temperature in units of @xmath18 , density ( @xmath19 ) in units of @xmath20 and time in units of @xmath21 , where @xmath2 is the mass of an @xmath22-particle . in other words",
    ", we will use units in which @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "although these are arbitrary units , to understand the physical consequences of our results , we use the lj parameters of argon as a reference . in that case ,",
    "one unit of time corresponds to @xmath27 seconds , while one unit of length corresponds to @xmath28nm@xcite .    as mentioned above ,",
    "apart from the pure lj fluid and the isotopic binary lj fluid mixture , a third system which will be studied , namely , a suspension of nanosized particles in a fluid , often called a nanofluid .",
    "one can obtain this system from the binary isotopic lj fluid mixture by changing the @xmath11 particles to much larger , nanosized particles while the @xmath22 particles remain regular lj particles , and changing the potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the following way .",
    "each nanoparticle is represented as a spherical cluster of radius @xmath31 with a smoothed uniform distribution of @xmath32 lj particles as proposed in refs . and .",
    "since we are only after typical time scales for which the expansion presented in sec.[expand ] below is valid , we restrict ourselves here to this simple nanoparticle model . for simplicity , we therefore take the strength of the lj potential between the constituent lj particles of the nanoparticles and the fluid particles to be the same , and the mass of the constituent lj particles of the nanoparticle is also taken to be equal to that of the fluid particles .",
    "@xmath31 will range from @xmath33 to @xmath34 in lj units , i.e.  from 0.34 nm to 2 nm ( which is a typical size of a quantum dot@xcite ) , while @xmath32 will be chosen such that for @xmath35 , the nanoparticle reduces to a single lj particle ( @xmath36 ) while for large @xmath31 the density of lj particles within the nanoparticle approaches one .",
    "this can be accomplished by choosing @xmath32 to be @xmath37 , leading to a maximum mass ratio of 217 between the nanoparticles and the fluid lj particles .",
    "one can show that the result of integrating the lj potentials corresponding to all the points in the spherical nanoparticle is that a nanoparticle interacts with a fluid lj particle through the potential@xcite @xmath38 \\label{vab}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the distance between the centre of the nano particle and the lj fluid particle , while the interaction potential between two nanoparticles is given by@xcite @xmath39 , \\label{vbb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the distance between the centres of the nanoparticles .",
    "note that because of the much larger size of the nanoparticles , far fewer will fit into a system of given volume than @xmath11 particles fit in an isotopic lj mixture of only lj particles .",
    "the systems studied in this paper are all in canonical equilibrium , i.e. , their distribution function @xmath40 in phase space ( @xmath41,@xmath42 ) is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44{\\rm d}{\\mathbf \\gamma}$ ] is the partition function , @xmath45 is the temperature , and @xmath46 is the hamiltonian which is of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a sum of pair potentials : @xmath49 where the prime excludes equal particles ( i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and the @xmath52 are of the form given in eqs. above .",

    "we will now briefly review the green s functions approach and its connection with the distribution of single particle displacements . for mass transport processes , the number density @xmath54 of a specific component",
    "@xmath55 at position @xmath56 at time @xmath0 can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the green s function for component @xmath55 ( @xmath22 or @xmath11 for a binary mixture ) , which is defined as@xcite @xmath59        \\delta[{\\bf r}'-{\\bf r}_{\\lambda i}(0)]\\rangle}_{\\mathrm{is } }    } {      { \\langle\\delta[{\\bf r}'-{\\bf r}_{\\lambda i}(0)]\\rangle}_{\\mathrm{is } }    }    , \\label{gdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the position of the @xmath12th particle of component @xmath55 at time @xmath0 and the average @xmath61 is over a ( possibly non - equilibrium ) initial state ( `` is '' ) , which has to be specified for the particular problem that one wants to study . the green s function @xmath62 can be interpreted as the probability that particle @xmath12 of component @xmath55 was displaced over @xmath56 in a time @xmath0 given that it started at @xmath63 .",
    "note that the green s functions do not depend on @xmath12 because particles of the same kind are indistinguishable .",
    "although the green s function approach is aimed primarily at non - equilibrium systems , we will restrict ourselves here only to equilibrium systems , because the time scales for the validity of the expansion to be presented below are expected to be similar in equilibrium and not - too - far - from - equilibrium systems , and the equilibrium system is much easier to deal with from a numerical point of view . in the equilibrium case , the green s functions become independent of @xmath63 because the system is homogeneous and are then identical to the van hove self - correlation functions @xmath64 ( with @xmath55 a component ) defined as@xcite @xmath65       \\right\\rangle , \\label{gsdef}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath66 refers to @xmath67 being a self - correlation function of a single particle .",

    ", note that each term on the right - hand side of eq . gives the same contribution to the sum due to the indistinguishability of particles of the same component .",

    "the expression for the van hove self - correlation function in eq . coincides with that for the green s function in eq . in cases where the green s functions have no @xmath71 dependence , i.e. , in equilibrium .",
    "note that like the green s function , the van hove self - correlation function @xmath72 can therefore be interpreted as the probability that a single fluid particle of component @xmath55 has experienced a displacement * r * in a time @xmath0 .",

    "the behaviour of these cumulants as a function of time has been investigated in the context of incoherent neutron scattering by schofield @xcite and sears @xcite .",
    "they showed that for equilibrium systems , the cumulants ( @xmath85 for @xmath86 , 4 , 6 ) have the following behaviour at small times : @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , while the odd cumulants vanish in equilibrium .",
    "this behaviour suggested a generalization , which has recently been obtained for a certain class of physical systems as a theorem @xcite . for a class of classical systems which includes systems with smooth potentials .",
    "however , in equilibrium , this point has a vanishingly small probability , so that the lj potential may be treated as effectively smooth . ] in canonical equilibrium , it was shown that the @xmath90 have the following form : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are coefficients independent of @xmath0 .",

    "it is natural to expect that for a small enough @xmath0 , the successive terms in these series should rapidly decrease",
    ". this would mean that the series converges and that one could use a finite number of terms , or even just the gaussian , as a good approximation to the whole series . applying the general rule that a series @xmath101 converges if @xmath102 to the series in eq .",

    "as explained above , to numerically estimate the time scales up to which the series expansion of the van hove self - correlation functions @xmath107 ( with @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) in eq . may converge or at least be useful , we are interested in the first few terms of the series . the terms in eq . which are of importance are then the coefficients @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "expressions for these coefficients are derived in sec.[expr ] , while in sec.[results ] the results of their numerical evaluation in simulations are presented .    for sufficiently small times @xmath0 , every successive term in the series in eq .",
    "would approach zero more rapidly than the previous term because of a larger power of @xmath0 associated with it .",
    "this gives us a simple relation to check when we could expect the terms in the series to decrease .",
    "the first estimate of a time scale , to be denoted by @xmath110 , follows from the criterion that for @xmath111 , the first term in the brackets in eq . , i.e.  @xmath33 , is of the same order of magnitude as the next term , i.e.@xmath112 . to find the order of magnitude of the latter , we need an order of magnitude estimate for @xmath113 , which we find as follows .",
    "the prefactor @xmath114 in eq .",
    "suggests that @xmath115 , since otherwise @xmath67 would be extremely small .",
    "the hermite polynomial @xmath113 contains no physical parameters , only numerical factors which are also of @xmath116 , so we conclude that @xmath117 . the second term in eq .",

    "the next simplest estimate of a time scale , to be denoted by @xmath122 , is determined by the time @xmath123 when the second and third terms in the square brackets in eq .",

    "leads to @xmath126 this @xmath122 also defines a time scale below which the subsequent terms in the series in eq . should decrease in magnitude .",
    "thus , for time scales sufficiently less than @xmath122 , the @xmath127 term can be neglected compared to the @xmath128 term in eq . , but for time scales larger than @xmath122 , the @xmath127 term certainly needs to be taken into account .",
    "one could in principle get additional time scale estimates @xmath129 by including higher order terms in eq . and comparing the @xmath84th with the @xmath130st term .",

    "the resulting expressions are polynomials in the velocities of the particles@xcite .",
    "below , it will turn out that only the highest power of the velocities in the expression of each @xmath140 leads to a non - zero contribution to @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "the velocities are independent gaussian distributed variables with zero mean ( cf .",
    "eqs . and ) , which allows some simplifications in the expressions for @xmath108 and @xmath109 in eqs . and , respectively .",

    "this is numerically advantageous since higher order cumulants tend to require more statistics to keep the error small .",
    "the first simplification is that , given the gaussian nature of the velocities , theorem a of ref . can be applied to show that the terms denoted by @xmath150 in eqs. do not contribute to the right - hand side of eqs . and , because they contribute cumulants which contain fewer powers of the velocity than the number of velocity factors @xmath151 in the cumulants , and according to theorem a , such cumulants are zero ( see the appendix in ref . for details ) .",
    "on the other hand , the first terms on the right - hand sides of eqs. contain just enough powers of the velocities to match the number of factors of @xmath151 in the cumulants in eqs .",
    "and so that theorem a does not apply and they might yield a non - zero result .",
    "thus only these terms in eqs. need to be taken into account .",
    "the next simplification involves the average over the velocities , which can be taken separately from the average over the positions because of the factored form of the canonical equilibrium distribution given in eq .. thus , canonical averages can be taken in two steps : first an average over velocities and then an average over positions . to apply this two - step process to cumulants",
    ", one needs to relate the cumulants to averages . using eq . , the cumulants on the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "and can be written in terms of moments which are simply averages of products of factors of @xmath140 . for velocity averages of products of independent gaussian distributed velocities with zero mean",
    ", we can use wick s theorem which states that the average can be obtained by pairing the velocities in all possible ways and then taking the average for each pair separately . note that the average of two velocities @xmath152 and @xmath153 is @xmath154 where the subscript @xmath155 of the brackets indicates that only the average over velocities is performed .",
    "afterwards , the average over positions , denoted by @xmath156 , still needs to be performed to obtain the full average .",
    "the straightforward method of writing the cumulants out in terms of moments introduces a lot of subtractions terms , which can be largely avoided by formulating a similar wick s rule for cumulants .",
    "however , the two - step nature of the averaging process , involving velocity as well as position averages , is a complicating factor here . forgetting for the moment about the position average , for gaussian distributed velocities , cumulants can be computed similarly as averages , i.e.using eq . , with the distinction that there be only `` connected contributions '' , in the sense that the pairing of velocities be such that all expressions in the cumulant are connected to each other . to give an example , for the cumulant @xmath157",
    ", the term @xmath158 does not connect the expressions @xmath159 and @xmath160 , and therefore does not contribute , while the terms @xmath161 and @xmath162 do connect the two , so that @xmath163 .",
    "however , when averaging with @xmath69 in eq . , there is a second , non - gaussian , average , namely , over the positions . as a consequence , although a term like @xmath164 may seem disconnected and therefore not to contribute to the cumulant @xmath165 , the second average over positions will , as it were , reconnect the parts .",
    "one can show such seemingly disconnected expressions ( as far as the velocities are concerned ) still yield a contribution to the cumulant which is equal to the position - cumulant of the factors , i.e. @xmath166 , where a subscript @xmath15 denotes a cumulant over the positions only .    with these rules on how to compute cumulants ,",
    "we now return to the expressions for @xmath108 and @xmath109 in eqs . and , respectively .",

    "the density dependence of @xmath175 and @xmath176 was also investigated using the same setup , but keeping the temperature fixed at @xmath188 , while the density ranged from @xmath189 to @xmath190 .",

    "the remaining parts of the coefficients only involve the potential , which in an isotopic mixture is the same as for a pure lj system .",
    "therefore , no new simulations are needed for this case ; the time scales are those of the pure lj system , multiplied by the square root of the mass ratio of the components and the original lj particles , i.e. : @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the mass of the particles in a single component lj fluid .    since in nature",
    ", there are no isotopes with large mass ratios , we conclude that for isotopic binary mixtures the time scales at which the series in eq . can be supposed to be useful are the same as those for a single lj fluid , i.e. , of the order of a picosecond .",
    "a nanofluid is a binary mixture of lj fluid particles ( @xmath22 particles ) and nanoparticles ( @xmath11 particles ) .",
    "for such a mixture , the time scales @xmath196 and @xmath197 and @xmath198 and @xmath199 need not be the same .",
    "they were here investigated using the same approach as above , but there are additional numerical challenges .",
    "first of all , for large @xmath11 particles , the typical relaxation and correlation times ( say of the particle velocity ) grow with increasing @xmath31 due to the increased inertia of the @xmath11 particle . as a result",
    ", it takes longer to equilibrate such a system , and one obtains fewer independent data points per time unit .",
    "secondly , since the @xmath11 particle is already quite large , to surround it with a liquid - like fluid of @xmath22 particles requires a large number of @xmath22 particles .",
    "this increase of the number of particles causes a substantial slow down of the simulations . to keep down the number of @xmath22 particles",
    ", one takes as few @xmath11 particles as possible .",
    "this contributes to a third difficulty , namely , that for the @xmath11 particles , there are fewer particles to average over , leading to poorer statistics .    given these difficulties ,",
    "fewer runs can be performed in a reasonable time for these systems and as a result the error bars on the data for the @xmath11 particles are substantially larger than those for the @xmath22 particles and of the lj fluids of the previous sections .",
    "nonetheless , we have been able to extract estimates for the timescales at which the series in eq .",
    "could be supposed to be useful also for these systems .    .the",
    "coefficients @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the lj particles ( @xmath22 ) and the nanoparticles ( @xmath11 ) in the nanofluid of sec.[nano ] at @xmath200.[c4c6nano ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in mixtures , there is a van hove self - correlation function for each component , and correspondingly , the time scales depend on the component whose van hove self - correlation function is studied , which is represented by a superscript @xmath10 or @xmath11 on @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we deduced for a binary isotopic mixture that the time scales @xmath121 and @xmath122 on which eq .",
    "could be supposed to be useful , simply scale as the square root of the mass @xmath201 of the component @xmath55 . as said before , since in nature",
    ", isotopes do not have very large mass ratios , for isotopic binary mixtures the time scales at which the series in eq .",
    "is useful are of the same order of magnitude as for a one - component fluid , i.e. , of the order of a picosecond .    finally , we studied these time scales in a recently proposed model of a nanofluid@xcite , and found that the time scales are there of the order of five to ten picoseconds for the nanoparticles ( decreasing with temperature and increasing with radius ) , while for the fluid particles in that model the time scale is still on the order of a picosecond . the difference in time scales",
    "could be due to the larger mass of the nanoparticles , causing the forces to have less influence on their velocities , which therefore remain close to their original ( gaussian ) distribution for a longer time than in a lj fluid .",
    "it is then no surprise that the distribution of displacements for nanoparticles can be described by a gaussian at longer time scales than for the lighter fluid particles .",
    "one may wonder whether the time scales found in this paper are not so short that the classical description on which they were based breaks down . a simple estimate of the time scale at which appreciable quantum effects can be expected is given by @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is planck s constant divided by @xmath204 . at room temperature",
    ", this is equal to about 25 femtoseconds .",
    "note that all of the time scales found in this paper were at picosecond or at tens of picosecond scales , i.e. , well above this quantum time scale .",
    "although our results for the time scales @xmath121 and @xmath122 are only estimates , they are encouraging for the possible application of a green s function approach to small scale nanometre length and picosecond time scales , since the van hove self - correlation functions are equilibrium versions of green s functions@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that the time scales for nonequilibrium systems are similar to those of equilibrium systems , which were on the order of picoseconds for fluid particles and on the order of ten picoseconds for nanoparticles .",
    "this suggests that expansions of the form in eq",
    ". can be useful for the green s function approach for transport problems taking place at and below picosecond time scales and at nanometre length scales in equilibrium and near - equilibrium systems .",

    "then , as an alternative to eq . , one can define the cumulants recursively as the average of the product of these repetitions minus the product of lower order cumulants of all possible groupings of the @xmath84 repetitions .",
