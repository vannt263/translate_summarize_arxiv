    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be detected at high redshift due to their high luminosities and hence they can be used to place stringent constraints on the evolution of large scale structure over a wide redshift range ( see hartwick et schade 1989 ) .",
    "our knowledge on the agn clustering properties comes mainly from large optical uv excess ( uvx ) surveys for qsos ( boyle et al .",
    "1988 , fang & mo 1993 , shanks & boyle 1994 , croom & shanks 1996 , la franca , andreani & cristiani 1998 ) .",
    "croom & shanks ( 1996 ) analysed the clustering properties of the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) and combined the results with that obtained from other qso surveys including the durham / aat uvx sample .",
    "they derived a clustering length of @xmath10 mpc at a mean redshift of 1.27 .",
    "la franca , andreani & cristiani ( 1998 ) derived comparable results ( @xmath11 mpc ) by investigating a sample of @xmath12 700 quasars in the redshift range @xmath13 .",
    "comparison of these clustering results in different redshifts rather favours a comoving model for the evolution of clustering . according to this model",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function remains fixed with redshift in comoving coordinates as the galaxy pair expands together with the background mass distribution .",
    "in contrast , in the stable model for clustering evolution , agn trace clumps of mass which have gravitationally collapsed in bound units and have therefore ceased to take part in the general expansion of the universe .",
    "however , most of the agn samples used in the analyses above , come from pencil beam surveys and contain a large fraction of high redshift agn .",
    "georgantopoulos & shanks ( 1994 ) studied the correlation function of a sample of about 200 iras selected seyfert galaxies .",
    "they detect a @xmath14 clustering signal on scales less than 10 @xmath15 mpc .",
    "although their statistics are limited , their results are more consistent with a comoving model .",
    "it is evident that there is a pressing need for large agn samples in the local universe in order to place tight constraints on the clustering evolution in a broad redshift range .",
    "analogous clustering studies in x - rays have been scarce but they are potentially interesting as they provide the opportunity to derive information on how the x - ray selected agn trace the underlying mass distribution . the first direct study ( using redshift information ) of the correlation function and clustering properties of x - ray",
    "selected agn is that of boyle & mo ( 1993 ) .",
    "they studied the local @xmath16 agn clustering properties using a sample from the @xmath17 extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) .",
    "they did not detect clustering at a statistically significant level ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "vikhlinin & forman ( 1995 ) analysed the angular clustering properties of a set of deep @xmath0 observations .",
    "their angular correlation length @xmath19 translates , using limber s equation ( peebles 1980 ) , to a spatial correlation length @xmath20 which is consistent with that derived in optical suveys .",
    "finally , carrera et al ( 1998 ) using a sample of 235 agn from two different soft x - ray surveys , the @xmath0 deep survey ( georgantopoulos et al . , 1996 ) and the @xmath21 survey ( mason et al .",
    "2000 ) derived the first direct evidence ( ie .",
    ", in 3 dimensions ) for clustering in an x - ray selected qso sample .",
    "they derived a low spatial correlation length between 1.5 and 5.5 @xmath15 mpc depending on the adopted model of clustering evolution .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the clustering properties of soft x - ray selected agn from the @xmath0 all sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "the large number of agn in this sample provides excellent statistics and hence the opportunity to put stringent constraints on the clustering properties in the local x - ray univerce .",
    "moreover , comparison with clustering results at higher redshift in both the x - ray and optical regime could provide valuable information on the evolution of clustering in the universe .",
    "the data used come from the @xmath0 all - sky survey bright source catalogue , rassbsc , ( voges et al .",
    "the rassbsc is a subsample of the brightest 18811 sources in the rass .",
    "the rass covers 98 per cent of the sky in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy range with 30 arcsecs angular resolution .",
    "we excluded all sources with count rate less than 0.1@xmath22 .",
    "this yields a catalogue which has a _ uniform _ count rate limit over the sky ( voges et al .",
    "we further exclude all sources between the strip ( -30,30 ) degrees in galactic latitude in order to minimize the effect of hydrogen absorption .",
    "although the majority of the rass sources are agn there is an appreciable contamination from stars and clusters of galaxies .",
    "therefore in order to study the agn cross - correlation function we first need to exclude all stars , groups and clusters of galaxies . in principle , one can utilise the hamburg optical identification catalogue ( bade et al .",
    "1998 ) which is an ongoing spectroscopic follow - up program of the rass sources in the northern sky , containing objective prism spectra for several thousand sources .",
    "however , as the hamburg catalogue contains optical identifications only for a small subsample of the rassbsc , we choose to use a different approach to exclude the stellar and extended objects from our sample .",
    "we have therefore cross correlated the rassbsc with known stellar catalogues , such as the smithsonian astrophysical observatory stellar catalogue ( http://xena.harvard.edu/software/sao ) and the stsci guide star catalogue ( http://www-gsss.stsci.edu ) .",
    "in addition we have excluded all known @xmath0 white dwarfs , cataclysmic variables , x - ray binaries and hot ( ob ) stars .",
    "details of these rosat catalogues are given in the gsfc heasarc web page http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov .",
    "the above cross - correlation resulted in the rejection of 6246 stars .",
    "the next step is to remove all known clusters and groups of galaxies from our sample .",
    "inspection of the hamburg catalogue shows that all identified clusters appear to be spatially extended in x - rays .",
    "hence we further exclude all sources which have an extension flag value greater than 40 ( see voges et al . for the definition of the extension flag value ) .",
    "indeed the cross correlation of our sample with the hamburg rass catalogue in the common ( @xmath23 degrees ) area shows no remaining clusters . after the application of the above corrections the vast majority of our sample , at least in the areas of the sky covered by the hamburg catalogue , consists of agn ( 86 per cent ) , while there is still some small stellar and galaxy contamination ( about 10 and 4 per cent respectively ) .    finally , we need to make corrections for the neutral hydrogen in the galaxy .",
    "the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band is very sensitive to photoelectric absorption .",
    "therefore the apparent sky density may change in different areas on the sky due to the changes in the hydrogen column density ( @xmath24 ) in our galaxy .",
    "the large scale variations of the @xmath24 with galactic latitude as well as the patchy absorption on smaller scales may introduce spurious signals in the correlation function . therefore , we used the leiden / dwingeloo atlas of galactic neutral hydrogen , ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) in order to remove the effects of the hydrogen absorption .",
    "as the above atlas contains @xmath24 data only for declinations @xmath25 we further exclude rassbsc sources outside the missing regions .",
    "the resulting final catalogue contains 2096 sources over 4.9 sr . in fig .",
    "[ proj ] we present the aitoff projection of our sample in galactic coordinates .",
    "the apparent large - scale density gradients , seen in fig [ proj ] , are due to patchy galactic absorption . in fig .",
    "[ nh ] we present the sky density as a function of the galactic column density @xmath24 .",
    "the solid line represents the best fit to the data .",
    "this is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density of galaxies per steradian and @xmath24 is the column density in units of @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "we find @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we used the two point angular correlation function to measure the clustering properties of our sample .",
    "the correlation function @xmath32 is defined in terms of the propability @xmath33 of finding two objects at a separation @xmath34 in two small solid angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37    where @xmath38 is the mean number density of this objects .",
    "for an unclustered population @xmath32=0 , while positive or negative values of @xmath32 indicate clustering or anticlustering respectively .",
    "we estimated the correlation function by comparing the distribution of our sample to that of a random sample .",
    "the random sample was constructed by generating angular positions at random over the sky and then folding them through the @xmath24 map .",
    "in particular , the points on the sky with the lowest @xmath24 are assigned a probability 1 ( always accepted ) while points on the sky with higher @xmath24 are assigned lower probabilities , following the @xmath27 vs. @xmath24 fit of fig .",
    "[ nh ] , and therefore have a lower chance of entering the random catalogue .",
    "the correlation estimator factor that we use is    @xmath39    while the error is given by ( peebles 1973 ) @xmath40    here @xmath41 is the number of data - data pairs and @xmath42 is the number of data - random pairs for a given separation .",
    "we use a random sample 30 times larger than our observed catalogue",
    ". then the normalization factor is @xmath43 - 1 ) the ratio of the total number of independent data - data pairs to the number of data - random pairs . in the equation above @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are the number of data and random ( after folding through the @xmath24 distribution ) points respectively .    the derived correlation function is presented in fig .",
    "[ wthita ] .",
    "we find @xmath46 and @xmath47 hence detecting a significant clustering at the 4.1@xmath3 confidence level ( using poissonian statistics ) between 0 and 8 degrees with @xmath48)=2.5@xmath49 . on larger scales",
    "the correlation function is consistent with an unclustered population . assuming a 2-point angular correlation function of the form @xmath50 we find that @xmath51 and @xmath52 degrees . if the value of @xmath53 is fixed at 0.8 , which is the value found for optically selected quasars , we find @xmath54 degrees . next , we performed a test in order to check whether our signal is diluted due to the small percentage of stellar contamination .",
    "we estimated the correlation function for all the identified agn in the hamburg / rass catalogue .",
    "there were 662 agn with declination above @xmath55 .",
    "the estimated correlation function is @xmath56 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath32 of our sample , within @xmath57 , suggesting that the stellar contamination does not have a major effect on the derived correlation amplitude .",
    "we also note that our results do not suffer from the possible amplification bias. vikhlinin & forman ( 1995 ) pointed out that when the best - fit angular correlation length is smaller than the fwhm of the rosat pspc point spread function , two or more sources can be detected as a single source . as a result the distribution of the confused sources may be biased with respect to the correlation function of the parent population .",
    "this amplification bias effect works towards the amplification of the correlation function amplitude ( cf .",
    "kaiser 1984 ) .",
    "however , in our case , confusion problems are very unlikely as the fwhm of the rosat pspc ( @xmath58 arcsec ) corresponds to a very small spatial separation ( @xmath59100 kpc ) at the typical redshift of the rass agn ( @xmath600.1 - 0.2 ) .",
    "next , we use limber s equation which gives the relation between the spatial and angular correlation function in order to calculate the correlation length @xmath20 in three dimensions .",
    "we have used a power - low shape for the spatial two point correlation function following groth & peebles ( 1977 ) : @xmath61    where @xmath20 is the correlation length in comoving coordinates , the parameter @xmath62 is fixed at the value of 1.8 and @xmath63 is the parameter describing clustering evolution .",
    "if @xmath64 the clustering is constant in comoving coordinates ( comoving clustering ) . if @xmath65 then the clustering is constant in proper coordinates ( stable clustering ) . the amplitude @xmath66 in two dimensions is related to the correlation length @xmath20 in three dimensions through the equation ( peebles 1980 ) :    @xmath67^{-p}y^{5-\\gamma}/f(y ) } { [ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}y^2dy\\phi(y)/f(y)]^2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath68 .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 is related to the distance and redshift through    @xmath70    finally , @xmath71^{1/2}$ ] , while @xmath72 determines the fraction of sources observable at a given @xmath69 ( or @xmath73 ) , i.e. , those with observed fluxes greater than the detection threshold .",
    "the cosmological parameter @xmath74 enters through the @xmath75 relation , the volume factor @xmath76 and the selection function @xmath72 ; here we use @xmath77 .",
    "the selection function @xmath72 depends also on the evolution of the agn luminosity function .",
    "boyle et al . ( 1993 ) derived the agn cosmological evolution in the form of pure luminosity evolution , with the characteristic luminosity @xmath78 varying with redshift as @xmath79 .",
    "the selection function can be written as    @xmath80    where the local x - ray luminosity function is given by a double power - law function ( boyle et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the lower limit of integration @xmath81 corresponds to the luminosity that can be observed at redshift @xmath73 with a flux limit @xmath82 .",
    "note that the flux limit changes over the sky although the count rate limit is uniform , ie . , @xmath83 .",
    "this is because the flux limit depends sensitively on the column density .",
    "for the conversion of the count rate to flux , a spectrum of @xmath84 was assumed , while the appropriate @xmath24 values were taken from hartmann & burton ( 1997 ) .",
    "the effective rassbsc flux limit is then the _ average _ flux limit over the areas covered by our sample ; we find @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "we derive a value of @xmath87 mpc assuming comoving clustering evolution and freezing the parameter @xmath62 at the value of 1.8 . alternatively ,",
    "if we repeat our calculations using @xmath88 , which we derived from our unconstrained @xmath32 fit , we find @xmath89 mpc .",
    "we consider the difference @xmath90 mpc between these two determinations of @xmath20 as a further source of uncertainty and we quote as our best estimate of @xmath20 their average value : @xmath91 mpc .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is derived by adding in quadrature @xmath92 and the formal fitting errors .",
    "note that in the case of stable clustering and for @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94 mpc .",
    "assuming a @xmath62=1.8 power law model we detect a significant clustering at @xmath95 confidence level between 0 and 8 degrees with @xmath96 .",
    "our analysis of @xmath32 implies @xmath97 mpc .",
    "note that our result comes from scales larger than @xmath122 degrees which corresponds to @xmath12 10 @xmath15 mpc at a redshift of @xmath98 .",
    "although the statistics of our sample are limited , the lack of signal at small scales is significant at a high confidence level .",
    "this could imply a change in the form of the agn correlation function at small separations .",
    "our result represents the first significant detection of clustering in the local x - ray universe .",
    "the boyle & mo ( 1993 ) analysis of a sample of 183 low redshift ( @xmath16 ) agns , from the emss survey , represented the first x - ray selected agn clustering study in the local universe .",
    "they detected a weak but not significant clustering signal on scales @xmath99 mpc .",
    "comparison of our findings with previous results at high redshift can give important clues on the evolution of clustering in the universe .",
    "we first compare with the results of carrera et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who analysed the clustering properties of two rosat , soft x - ray selected agn samples at higher redshifts , the rixos and the drs samples containing about 235 agn in total .",
    "they detect a 2@xmath3 clustering signal in the rixos sample ( mean @xmath100 ) while no clustering is detected in the drs sample .",
    "a correlation length of @xmath593.5 @xmath101mpc was found in the case of comoving evolution , significantly lower than our results .",
    "however , as their derived correlation length , @xmath102 , may depend upon @xmath103 ( the distance up to which the number of predicted and observed pairs are compared in order to derive @xmath102 ) , larger samples are needed at high redshifts in order to constrain @xmath102 .",
    "better statistics can be provided by using optical samples .",
    "croom & shanks ( 1996 ) used a sample of @xmath104 uvx agn .",
    "they obtain a comoving clustering length of @xmath105 comoving mpc at a mean redshift of @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , comparison with our clustering length at low redshifts provides strong evidence for the comoving model of clustering evolution .",
    "our derived agn clustering length is similar to that of local galaxies .",
    "hence it appears that agn randomly sample the galaxy distribution and they do not trace the high peaks of the density field despite their low density and high luminosity ( cf efstathiou & rees 1988 ) .",
    "this result is corroborated by the analysis of the cross - correlation of low redshift emss agn with apm galaxies ( smith , boyle & maddox 1995 ) .",
    "they find that the cross - correlation amplitude is similar to the galaxy auto - correlation amplitude thus supporting the idea that agn randomly sample the galaxy population .",
    "this is again consistent with imaging studies of the agn environments ( cf .",
    "boyle & couch 1993 ) .",
    "these authors find no excess number of galaxies around radio - quiet agn , again pointing out that galaxies and agn have similar environments .",
    "our work has important implications for the origin of the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "several studies constrained the contribution of agn to the xrb by using the auto - correlation function of the xrb fluctuations ( eg carrera & barcons 1992 , georgantopoulos et al .",
    "1993 , soltan & hasinger 1994 ) .",
    "these studies conclude that if agn have a clustering length of @xmath107 mpc similar to opticaly selected agn and they evolve according to the comoving model they can produce only about half of the xrb intensity .",
    "our results appear to maintain the validity of this constraint .    in the near future",
    ", we anticipate a drastic improvement of our knowledge of agn clustering , at least in x - ray wavelenghts .",
    "the rass identification programmes will be essential in providing a large agn sample in the local universe with redshift information .",
    "the new abrixas mission will be invaluable in providing local agn samples in the hard x - ray band which is not prone to galactic absorption .",
    "finally , the xmm serendipitous surveys are expected to provide tens of thousands high redshift agn thus strengthening the clustering statistics at high redshift .",
    "we are grateful to the referee f. carrera for many useful comments and suggestions .",
    "aa thanks xavier barcons for many useful suggestions .",
    "we wish to thank m. kontiza for her valuable support in the realisation of the above project which is based on a formal collaboration scheme between the university of athens and the national observatory of athens .",
