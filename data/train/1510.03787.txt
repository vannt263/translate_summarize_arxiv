    "ultracold atoms have become a versatile platform for exploring quantum matter in the presence of a variety of gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "one important breakthrough in this direction is the recent experimental synthesis of coupling between a particle s spin and linear momentum , or spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , for pseudo - spin - half ultracold atoms  @xcite via the light ",
    "atom interaction  @xcite .",
    "such synthetic so coupling emulates the rashba and dresselhaus so coupling for electrons in solids that plays a crucial role for many condensed - matter phenomena  @xcite . because of the coupled spin and momentum ,",
    "many interesting and exotic so - coupling - related phenomena have been theoretically proposed and experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "while electrons have spin - half , pseudospin of atoms , defined by their hyperfine states , could have higher spins .",
    "for instance , spin-1 bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been widely studied in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . in this context , the recent experimental realization of so coupling for spin-1 becs through raman coupling among three hyperfine states  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig : f0 ] ) or with the use of a gradient magnetic field  @xcite provides an interesting avenue for exploring so - coupling - related physics in high - spin systems . in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the so coupling is generated together with tunable transverse - zeeman and spin - tensor potentials .",
    "while the transverse - zeeman potential plays the same role as in the spin - half system @xcite  to topologically change the band structure by opening a gap , the spin - tensor potential has fundamentally different rotation properties and acts only in spin-1 ( or higher - spin ) space .",
    "therefore , the system enables exploration of spin - tensor - related physics in the so - coupled superfluid .",
    "the interplay between so coupling and both potentials leads to a rich single - particle band structure  @xcite , which characterizes quantum phases with itinerant magnetism and different types of phase transitions that have been experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "however , interaction effects on both ground state phase diagrams and collective excitations in such spin-1 system have been largely unexplored .    in this paper , we study the effects of density - density and spin - spin interactions , two natural elements in spinor becs  @xcite , on the ground - state phase diagrams and elementary excitations .",
    "our results are based on the variational - wavefunction approach and numerical simulation of gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , which agree with each other .",
    "the main results are as follows :    , which controls the spin - tensor potential.,width=325 ]    \\(1 ) the ground - state phase diagrams are obtained for different parameters .",
    "particularly , there exists an interaction - induced stripe phase exhibiting in - phase or out - of - phase modulations between spin - tensor and zero - spin - component density waves .",
    "the size of the stripe - phase region is proportional to the ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the stripe phase is the coherent superposition of components from three band minima and possesses both crystalline and superfluid properties , resembling the supersolid phases @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the phase transitions ( transition order and change of properties ) are characterized using the spin - tensor density , the time - of - flight momentum distribution , and the period of collective dipole motions of the system .",
    "\\(3 ) we reveal rich roton phenomena in the bogoliubov - excitation spectrum , including symmetric / asymmetric double - roton structures and the roton gap closing at the stripe - phase boundary .",
    "such double - roton structures have not been found in widely studied superfluids such as liquid @xmath0he  @xcite , becs  with long range interactions @xcite , and so - coupled spin - half becs  @xcite , which possess single - roton excitations .",

    "since @xmath16 has effects only in the spatial @xmath17 direction , one can assume that the ground - state wavefunction in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions remains the case without it .",

    "<S> the recent experimental realization of spin - orbit ( so ) coupling for spin-1 ultracold atoms opens an interesting avenue for exploring so - coupling - related physics in large - spin systems , which is generally unattainable in electronic materials . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the effects of interactions between atoms on the ground states and collective excitations of so - coupled spin-1 bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in the presence of a spin - tensor potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ferromagnetic interaction between atoms can induce a stripe phase exhibiting in - phase or out - of - phase modulating patterns between spin - tensor and zero - spin - component density waves . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the phase transitions between different phases using the spin - tensor density as well as the collective dipole motion of the bec . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exists a double maxon - roton structure in the bogoliubov - excitation spectrum , attributed to the three band minima of the so - coupled spin-1 bec . </S>"
