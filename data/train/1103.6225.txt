    "there has been some indication of a spectral index variation between the radio and mm regimes , suggesting the possibility of a physically distinct , second synchrotron component @xcite , although @xcite argue that the variations may in fact be due to known temporal variability of the snr .    in this paper",

    "therefore we conclude that there is either a problem with the extinction correction or relative calibration of the optical observations , or the intrinsic synchrotron spectrum has curvature or additional breaks such that it can not be properly characterized by a single power law at mid - ir to optical wavelengths .    a detailed account of the synchrotron spectrum of the crab nebula ( and other pulsar wind nebulae ) is provided by the diffusive synchrotron radiation ( dsr ) model of @xcite . in the dsr model , the magnetic field",

    "the predicted emission spectrum will contain a break at a frequency that is a function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the magnetic field strength ( @xmath57 ) , and the minimum energy ( @xmath58 ) of the power law distribution of relativistic particles , specifically @xmath59 .",

    "while the @xcite 1.3 @xmath5 measurement lies slightly above the power law , the integrated spectrum including newer data does not exhibit a significant excess component at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the 170 @xmath5 iso measurement @xcite seems to confirm the location of the break .",
    "future observations in the 200  800 @xmath5 range should help to better refine the location and sharpness of the break .",
    "maps at @xmath66 resolution of the crab nebula s spectral index between 2  mm and radio wavelengths are shown in figure [ fig : index ] .",
    "these maps show significant structure in the spectral index , and strongly resemble those of @xcite ( 1.3 mm - 21 cm ) and @xcite ( 850 @xmath5 - 21 cm ) .",

    "the random uncertainties are dominated by the gismo data . except at the faint edges of the snr , the random uncertainties in the gismo data are @xmath72 ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "thus @xmath73 .",
    "although the random uncertainties spectral index maps are relatively modest , there are at least four potential sources of systematic errors which may affect the apparent structure in these spectral index maps .",
    "the first is the significant difference in the resolution of the original maps .",
    "the radio maps were convolved to the resolution of the gismo image (  [ subsec : radiod ] ) .",
    "however , if this process did not accurately reproduce the gismo beam , then there would be artificial changes in the spectral index in regions where there are steep brightness gradients . to check for errors introduced by a resolution mismatch ,",
    "the convolved resolution of the radio map was changed by a factor of 50% .",
    "this produced minimal changes the spectral index map , indicating that the observed spectral index variations are not a result of mismatched resolution .",
    "a second potential source of error is improper background subtraction .",
    "the background levels were checked by examining the correlation of the radio and 2 mm intensities at intermediate brightness levels ( @xmath74 mjy sr@xmath20 ) .",
    "the correlations between the radio and gismo images are very linear and extrapolate to zero intercepts indicating 2 mm background errors of @xmath75 mjy sr@xmath20 with respect to the 21 cm data , and @xmath76 mjy sr@xmath20 with respect to the 6 cm data .",
    "comparison with figure [ fig : images ] indicates that except in the outermost portions of the snr , this background error is @xmath77 of the observed surface brightness , and thus any induced errors in the spectral index should be @xmath78 , ( much less in the brighter central regions ) .",
    "furthermore , as the background errors have opposite signs with respect to the 21 and 6 cm images , yet the spectral index maps are very similar , we conclude that improper background subtraction can not account for the observed structure in the central regions of the spectral index maps .",
    "however , at the edges of the crab nebula , the emission of the snr falls to levels at or below the uncertainty in the background .",
    "therefore , we can not reliably determine changes in the spectral index at the edges of the snr and do not draw conclusions about the spectral index in the outermost @xmath79 of the maps shown in figure [ fig : index ] .",
    "a third possible source of error is that either the radio or the 2  mm images may be missing flux at particular spatial scales .",
    "this may clearly affect the radio data due to the limited @xmath80 coverage provide by an interferometer such as the vla .",
    "it may also affect the gismo data due to the periodic nature of the scan pattern and the processing needed to separate and remove the temporal variation of the atmospheric emission .",
    "the radio maps were created using maximum entropy deconvolution provided with a low- resolution model to account for flux at missing spatial scales .",
    "the gismo maps were reduced using the crush package which iteratively removes celestial , foreground , and instrument components as measured with the scan pattern one - by - one until all that remains is the source and white noise .",
    "figure [ fig : power ] shows the normalized spatial power spectra ( @xmath81 as a function of spatial frequency @xmath82 ) of the 2  mm gismo map , the 3.3  mm map , and the 21  cm radio map . for each data",
    "set , the power spectrum is calculated on the images at their original spatial resolution .",
    "the 2  mm and 21  cm power spectra are well correlated at low spatial frequencies ( @xmath83 , or spatial scales @xmath84 ) .",
    "because of the larger psf , the power seen by gismo ( and mustang ) becomes increasingly attenuated with respect to that of measured by the vla at smaller scales . at the smallest angular scales , the mustang power spectrum flattens due to white noise ( instrumental in nature , and thus unaffected by the beam ) .",
    "this comparison indicates that missing flux at certain spatial scales is not a likely source of the observed spectral index variations .",
    "arcsec@xmath20 ) the power spectra are in fair agreement",
    ". the larger beams of the gismo and mustang data cause some attenuation with respect to the vla data at the higher frequencies .",
    "white noise flattens the spectra on scales smaller than the beam ( e.g. mustang data ) .",
    "[ fig : power ] ]    the fourth potential source of error may be caused by the difference in the epochs of the two maps .",
    "in addition to the overall evolution in the crab nebula s size and brightness , there have been observations of very rapid changes at small spatial scales at optical , x - ray , and radio wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the similarity between the 21  cm and 6  cm spectral index maps provides a strong indicator that the temporal variations are not significant . for temporal changes to be responsible for the observed spectral index variations , they would need to be negligible between 1987 and 2001 ( the epochs of the radio maps ) , and then rapidly become significant in the interval from 2001 to 2008 .",
    "we also attempted to calculate the 2 - 3.3 mm and 1.3 - 2  mm spectral index maps using the gismo data and either the 3.3  mm mustang data or the 1.3  mm mambo @xcite observations .",
    "however , because of the close proximity of the wavelengths , small errors in the background or large scale structure lead to magnified effects in the derived spectral index , which cause the resulting spectral index map to be unreliable .",
    "the mm data sets alone are insufficient to provide accurate spectral index maps over such small ranges in wavelength .",
    "having ruled out various sources of systematic error above , we conclude that the observed spectral index variations shown in figure [ fig : index ] are real properties of the snr , and are not caused by systematic effects inherent in the data or the analysis procedures .",
    "the reality of the spectral index variations is strengthened by a very strong correlation with those found by @xcite at 1.3 mm and @xcite at 850 @xmath5 using different instruments .",
    "additionally , in figure [ fig : overlay ] we compare the spectral index with the synchrotron emission as depicted at and wavelengths .",
    "the regions of flatter spectral index are well correlated with the toroidal structure of emission that surrounds the pulsar .",
    "this structure is present at ir wavelengths , but is most distinct at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "+      @xcite have argued that the spectral index variations , along with the integrated 1.3 mm flux density which appeared to lie above the extrapolation of the radio synchrotron spectrum , were indications of a distinct synchrotron component generated by a separate population of relativistic electrons . with measurements at 850 @xmath5 , @xcite found similar spectral index variations , but with better signal to noise and correspondingly less apparent small - scale structure .",
    "however , their integrated flux density is a good match to the extrapolation of the radio spectrum .",
    "they conclude that a second synchrotron component is not required , and suggest that the known temporal variations in the region near the pulsar may be responsible for the flatter spectral index in the region . from analysis of wmap @xcite ,",
    "archeops @xcite , and published integrated flux densities , @xcite also conclude that the data are not significantly better fit by the inclusion of an additional synchrotron or cold dust component to enhance emission at mm wavelengths .",
    "our integrated 2 mm flux density measured by gismo supports the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , and weaken the argument for a second component .",
    "however , because we find the same spectral index variations when comparing to radio images for two different epochs , we do not believe that temporal variation between the times of the radio and mm observations can be responsible for the spectral index variations .",
    "the presence of small - scale spectral index variations at wavelengths @xmath85  mm implies the integrated spectrum of the crab nebula is probably better characterized by a more gradual change in slope rather than a sharp break from one spectral index to another ( eq .",
    "1 ) . however , the present far - ir to mm data are insufficient to reveal this distinction in the integrated emission .",
    "the spectral index variations of the synchrotron emission also impact study of the dust emission , which is strongest between 10 and 100 @xmath40 m .",
    "accurate spatial and spectral information for the dust requires subtraction of the synchrotron component .",
    "the synchrotron emission can not be simply extrapolated from longer or shorter wavelengths using the global spectral index .",
    "if local variations are not included , residual synchrotron emission will mistakenly be attributed to dust , which will adversely impact assessments of the dust temperature , mass , composition , and spatial distribution .",
    "we present 2  mm observations of the crab nebula using the goddard iram superconducting 2  mm observer ( gismo ) at the iram 30  m telescope . as these are among the first gismo observations , they provide a test of the instrument , the observing strategy , and the data reduction with respect to extended sources .",
    "the gismo map for the crab nebula gives a total integrated flux density of @xmath25  jy which is in accordance with the known radio / sub millimeter spectrum of the crab nebula .",
    "the radio end of the spectrum is described well using a power law with @xmath86 which matches the well - established value of @xcite . a simultaneous power law fit to synchrotron emission at 3",
    " 8 @xmath5 allows us to locate the break in the spectrum to be at @xmath1 ghz .",
    "however in detail , the break may not be sharp , and the frequency may vary at different locations within the nebula .",
    "we observe no excess of flux which would indicate the presence of a new synchrotron component as proposed in @xcite .",
    "spectral index maps were created to compare the gismo data with the radio regime .",
    "two vla maps at 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz were used .",
    "comparisons with these maps produce similar results and both seem to show a trend of flattening of the spectral index in the inner regions of the nebula close to the pulsar .",
    "the region of flattest spectral index is well correlated with the torus in the central region of the nebula as seen at ir and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "we confirm the mm - radio spectral index variations observed by @xcite and @xcite , but as we derive the same spectral index variations when comparing to radio data from two different epochs , we conclude that temporal variations in the synchrotron emission near the pulsar can not account for the observed changes in spectral index .",
