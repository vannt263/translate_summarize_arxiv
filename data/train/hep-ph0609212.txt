    "light - front field theory starts with the paper by dirac in 1949 , when he proposed different forms to describe relativistic systems  @xcite .",
    "after dirac , light - front field theory was applied to calculated many process in relativistic nuclear physics and particle physics ( see the reviews by brodsky , pinsky , pauli  @xcite and harindranath  @xcite for details ) . in parallel , the description of the electromagnetic properties of hadronic systems within the light - front dynamics framework , based on the introduction of a valence bound state wave function , has found some success   @xcite . in the light - front dynamics",
    "the bound state wave functions are defined on the hyper - surface @xmath1 .",
    "these wave functions are covariant under kinematical front - form boosts , due to the stability of fock - state decomposition under these boosts  @xcite .    in recent works , ( see , e.g. , ) , a third path for evaluating hadron electromagnetic ( em ) form factors has been proposed .",
    "the mandelstam covariant expression for the matrix elements of the current has been calculated replacing the quark - hadron vertex function in the valence range by a hadron wave function obtained in a dynamical model , able to reproduce the energy spectrum . in those works",
    "the analytical structure of quark - hadron vertex function has been neglected , retaining only the poles from the constituent propagators . in this contribution",
    "we will study the reliability of such an approximation within an analytic , covariant model for the pion em form factor  @xcite .",
    "in general , the pion em form factor is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the electromagnetic current operator .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the quark fields  @xmath6 and charge @xmath7  ( @xmath8 is the flavor of the quark field ) : @xmath9 .    in the impulse approximation",
    "the em form factor is given by : @xmath10 \\gamma(k , p^{\\prime } ) \\gamma(k , p ) \\label{ffactor0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the pion - quark vertex function .",
    "here , we will show calculations for a vertex function with a symmetric form , previously used in ref .  :",

    "the @xmath18 momentum integration has two contributions : ( i ) @xmath19 and ( ii ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . the first interval ( i ) in the @xmath18 integration includes the contribution of the valence component of the wave function and the second one ( ii ) corresponds to the contribution of the pair term  @xcite .",
    "the pion valence wave function for the symmetric vertex is given by  @xcite : @xmath22   \\\\ & & \\times \\frac{p^+}{m^2_\\pi - m^2_{0 } } .",
    "\\label{wf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the fraction of the momentum carried by the quark .",
    "the function @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 the free square mass of the quark - antiquark system is @xmath26 and the normalization constant @xmath27 is found from the condition @xmath28 .",
    "the parameters of the model are the quark mass @xmath29  gev , the regulator @xmath30  gev mass and the experimental pion mass @xmath31  gev  @xcite .",
    "our choice of the regulator mass value fits the pion decay constant @xmath32  mev .",
    "taking into account only the poles coming from the quark propagators in eq .",
    "( [ ffactor ] ) , the pion em form factor is calculated from : i ) the residue of the pole of the spectator quark on - minus - shell ( _ valence _ contribution ) , and ii ) a contribution coming from the pair production mechanism ( _ non - valence _ contribution ) . the pole approximation  ( @xmath33 ) is compared with the full result in different reference frames , labeled by different values of the plus component of the momentum transfer . in order to accomplish the freedom of changing the frames ,",
    "let us parametrize the momentum transfer as follows : @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the poles in the @xmath37 integration contributing to the pion em current in the triangle diagram from the quark propagators , in the pa , correspond to two intervals in the @xmath18 integration : the first is @xmath38 and in this case , the pole is  @xmath39 ( valence region ) and , the second one is ( ii ) @xmath40 , and we consider the pole @xmath41 ( pair term region ) .    the em pion form factor within the pa is given by @xmath42 in the pa , the contributions coming from the poles of the quark - pion vertex are neglected .",
    "we have used three values of @xmath43 ( drell - yan condition , @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , the em form factor in the drell - yan frame reduces to the valence contribution , namely @xmath47 \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\times \\frac { \\psi^{*}_{f}(x , k_\\perp ) \\psi_{i}(x , k_\\perp ) } { x ( 1-x)^2 } , \\label{ffwf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .    in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 , the pion form factor calculated within the pa for @xmath49 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , is presented .",
    "results obtained considering both the valence contribution only ( @xmath50 ) and valence plus nonvalence contributions , eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) , are shown .",
    "the comparison with the exact result , eq .",
    "( [ ffactor ] ) , indicates that in the drell - yan frame pa works very badly , while in the frame where the momentum transfer has no transverse components at all pa appears remarkably effective , in particular at high momentum transfer . in this kinematical region , the pair production mechanism dominates , that can be related to the absorption of a @xmath51 pair by a single constituent , that has a given longitudinal - momentum distribution .",
    "the pion em form factor is calculated for @xmath52 up to @xmath53 ^ 2 $ ] with the covariant symmetric model for the quark - pion vertex  @xcite .",
    "the exact calculation is compared with an approximate evaluation of the form factor in frames with different values of @xmath0 . in the propagator pole approximation , investigated in this contribution ,",
    "only the poles originated by the quark propagators are taken into account , while the poles of the quark - hadron vertex are disregarded in the analytical integration over the light - front energy .",
    "we found that in the frame where @xmath0 is maximal and the pair term dominates , the approximation is able do describe qualitatively well the exact results .",
