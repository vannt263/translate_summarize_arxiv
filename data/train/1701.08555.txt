    "a minimal presentation of a numerical monoid @xmath3 ( that is , an additive submonoid of the natural numbers ) encapsulates the minimal relations among generators of @xmath3 .",
    "such minimal presentations arise in the study of toric ideals , where they correspond to minimal generating sets for kernels of monomial maps @xcite , and algebraic statistics , where they correspond to markov bases @xcite .",
    "additionally , many arithmetic invariants of interest in combinatorial commutative algebra and factorization theory can be easily recovered ( both theoretically and computationally ) from a minimal presentation , making them a particularly useful tool in computational algebra  @xcite .    in this paper , we examine families of numerical monoids obtained by `` shifting '' a chosen generating set . in particular , given positive integers @xmath4 , consider numerical monoids of the form @xmath5 indexed by a shift parameter @xmath2 .",
    "our main result is theorem  [ t : minpresbij ] , which describes how minimal presentations of @xmath1 vary with large @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , we give an explicit bijection between the minimal presentations of @xmath1 and those of @xmath6 when @xmath7 .    following theorem  [ t : minpresbij ] , we characterize the behavior of several arithmetic invariants determined by minimal presentations ( e.g.  betti numbers and catenary degree ) , resulting in periodic or periodic - linear descriptions in each case .",
    "some of these characterizations are new , while others strengthen existing results in the literature @xcite .",
    "our approach unifies these results ( old and new ) as consequences of a deeper structural phenomenon that occurs among the minimal relations of @xmath1 for large @xmath2 , and improves each lower bound on @xmath2 that was previously given ; see remark  [ r : vucompare ] for a thorough discussion of the benefits of our approach and resulting improvements .",
    "one of the primary consequences of theorem  [ t : minpresbij ] lies in the realm of computation . while minimal presentations ( and many of the arithmetic invariants they determine ) are generally more difficult to compute for monoids with large generators , our results give a way to more efficiently perform these computations in some cases by instead computing a minimal presentation for a numerical monoid with smaller generators in the same shifted family .",
    "we discuss the specifics in remark  [ r : minprescomputation ] , including a forthcoming implementation in the popular ` gap ` package ` numericalsgps ` @xcite .",
