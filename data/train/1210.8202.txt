    "in recent years , it was shown that fractal analysis can be applied to the solutions of differential equations and dynamical systems ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of dynamical systems ,",
    "fractal analysis consists of studying the box dimension and minkowski content of trajectories or orbits .",
    "several articles with fractal analysis of bifurcations of dynamical systems ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) showed that there is a direct connection between the change in box dimension of trajectories of dynamical systems and the bifurcation of that system . around the hyperbolic singularities",
    "the box dimension is trivial ( @xmath0 ) , while around the nonhyperbolic singularities the box dimension is positive and connected to the appropriate bifurcation .",
    "in fact , box dimension shows the multiplicity of singularity or limit cycle in the case of weak focus or multiple limit cycle ( see @xcite ) . beside this , in the article @xcite , multiplicity was also connected to the growth of @xmath1- neighbourhood of the orbit near the homoclinic loop . at the beginning , this phenomenon was studied only in the continuous dynamical systems , but the same occur in the discrete systems .",
    "the article @xcite showed that the above result for box dimension can also be proven for generic saddle - node and period - doubling bifurcations of one - dimensional discrete dynamical systems . in the paper @xcite the result from the previous paper were generalized to the class of finitely nondegenerate maps in @xmath2 and applied it to one and two - parameter bifurcations with generalized sufficient conditions .",
    "so in the one - dimensional systems , the box dimension at the bifurcation point shows the maximum number of possible fixed point that can bifurcate in a given family of systems .",
    "of course , now we are interested in this connection for other bifurcations .",
    "hence , it is natural to continue with the fractal analysis of two - dimensional discrete dynamical systems . for the result about the trivial box dimension of the orbit near the hyperbolic fixed point in @xmath3 ,",
    "see the article @xcite . in this article",
    "we will show the results about the box dimension of the orbit around a nonhyperbolic fixed point in @xmath4 .",
    "we look at the following bifurcations : one multiplier on the unit circle and two complex conjugated multipliers with the nonresonant condition . for the bifurcation of nonhyperbolic fixed point with only one multiplier on the unit circle , we get similar result for the orbit on the center manifold , which correspond to the bifurcation of appropriate one - dimensional system . regarding the neimark - sacker bifurcation ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the situation is more complicated .",
    "as in the bifurcation analysis of this bifurcation , the main problem is the difference of the dynamics between the irrational and rational case .",
    "we will see that the box dimensions for this cases are also different .",
    "since neimark - sacker bifurcation is , in fact , hopf bifurcation for maps , we will see how this result is related to the result for hopf bifurcation showed in @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for studying the box dimension of dynamical systems is related to the problem of multiplicity or cyclicity of fixed point , singularity or limit cycle .",
    "we are interested to explore how box dimension behaves during the bifurcations in @xmath4 of discrete and continuous systems , its connection to the cyclicity problem and how it can be found helpful in bifurcation analysis of some complicated bifurcations in higher dimension . moreover",
    ", this connection could be applied as numerical tool in bifurcation analysis since there exists effective algorithms for calculating box dimension .",
    "now , we will introduce the notions of box dimension and minkowski content , as basic terms which are used in our fractal analysis .",
    "first , we recall that the fractal dimension such as box dimension ( also known as minkowski dimension , minkowski - bouligand dimension , capacity dimension , limit capacity ) , can be used to analyze various objects such as various sets , graphs of a function , attractors , trajectories , etc .",
    "fractal analysis consists of getting the results of the fractal dimension and putting them in the context according to other properties of the studied object . in the case of dynamical systems",
    ", we connect the box dimension with the bifurcation , its type and the number of bifurcating objects . in our analysis",
    "we use the box dimension because , for the orbit of discrete dynamical system , the hausdorff dimension fails to show anything .",
    "namely , because of its property of countable stability , the hausdorff dimension does not see the countable sets at all . on the other hand ,",
    "the box dimension is only finitely stable so it can see the countable sets and the difference between the orbits around the hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic fixed point .",
    "now we recall the notions of box dimension and minkowski content . for further details see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we prove the result for the two - dimensional systems with only one multiplier on the unit circle by using the center manifold theory . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyze the neimark - sacker bifurcation .",
    "we will see that there is a difference in box dimension in rational and irrational case .",
    "the rational case will be proven by direct calculation , while the irrational case is showed using the analogous result for the hopf bifurcation from the article @xcite .",

    "it is clear that @xmath87 is a nonhyperbolic fixed point of the system .",

    "the above - mentioned procedure for getting the box dimension of the orbit on the center manifold can be analogously applied to the orbits on the stable and unstable manifolds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this result can also be applied to appropriate bifurcations of continuous dynamical systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we study the bifurcation at the nonhyperbolic fixed point with two complex conjugate eigenvalues on the unit circle when invariant curve bifurcates called neimark - sacker bifurcation . for details , see @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .    from @xcite , we know that the polar normal form of one - parameter family of maps for neimark - sacker bifurcation is @xmath170 where @xmath171 , and coefficients @xmath172 satisfy the bifurcation conditions : @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 for @xmath176 .",
    "since the map @xmath30 does nt depend on the angle @xmath177 , studying the existence of the invariant curve is simple .",
    "on the other hand , the map @xmath112 depends on @xmath178 , which complicates the study of the orbit structure on the invariant curve , and consequently , the calculation of box dimension .",
    "all the previously studied bifurcations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) showed that the box dimension of a orbit around the nonhyperbolic fixed point is connected with the box dimension of the invariant set which emerge at the bifurcation point .",
    "for instance , in the bifurcation of one - dimensional discrete dynamical systems when only fixed point can bifurcate , the box dimension is between 0 and 1 .",
    "furthermore , the box dimension in hopf bifurcation when we have limit cycles is greater then 1 .",
    "moreover , in all other bifurcations of discrete and continuous systems the invariant sets which emerge consist of only one orbit .",
    "for example , the limit cycle which bifurcates from the hopf bifurcation has box dimension 1 , and consist of only one trajectory . in the case of neimark - sacker bifurcation ,",
    "the originate invariant curve consists of many different orbits , and their structures depend on the map @xmath179 from ( @xmath180 ) , with @xmath181 the radius of invariant curve .    we know that the orbit structure on the invariant curve is depended only on the map @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , there is a case @xmath183 , @xmath184 @xmath185 .",
    "then @xmath186-cycles emerge by the bifurcation and the box dimension of every orbit on the invariant curve is 0 ( property of finite stability ) . in the case",
    "@xmath183 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 irrational , on the invariant curve every orbit is dense and its box dimension is @xmath189 .",
    "it is known that in general case with @xmath190 @xmath185 , the orbit structure changes by changing the parameter between rational and irrational rotation numbers ( arnold tongues , see @xcite,@xcite ) .    in the article @xcite , it was showed that in the neighbourhood of the ( un)stable hyperbolic fixed point in @xmath191 , the box dimension of every orbit is 0 .",
    "now we want to establish what happens with the box dimension of an orbit around the nonhyperbolic fixed point .",
    "so there is no need to study whole family of one - parameter maps but only the system for the bifurcation value @xmath157 because then the point @xmath192 is a nonhyperbolic fixed point , and the box dimension is positive .",
    "our goal is to determine the value of that box dimension .",
    "hence , we look at the polar normal form for neimark - sacker bifrucation at the bifurcation value @xmath157 @xmath193 where @xmath173 ( nondegeneracy condition ) and @xmath194{1}$ ] , for @xmath195 ( nonresonant condition ) . we consider the orbits of the system ( @xmath196 ) around the nonhyperbolic fixed point @xmath192 .",
    "let @xmath197 , and define @xmath198 when we draw only one orbit @xmath199 , we observe that the points are spirally going to the origin , and that is why the orbit @xmath199 is called a * discrete spiral*. to be precise , for @xmath197 the discrete spiral is spirally going to the origin , but for @xmath200 the orbit is spirally going away from the origin .",
    "furthermore , if the rotation angle is positive , then the spiral has a positive direction , and otherwise the direction is negative .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "now we recall that the generalized polar normal form for the neimark - sacker bifurcation proven in the article @xcite ( theorem 5 ) is @xmath205 and the corresponding nondegeneracy condition : @xmath206 it is clear that @xmath207 is the order of nondegeneracy of the map @xmath80 .",
