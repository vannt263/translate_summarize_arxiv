    "this is amply manifest in the gravitational collapse to a black hole which no other interaction can stop .",
    "along with the definition of @xmath147 this naturally leads us to consider gravitational accelerators , and the acceleration ( or other effects ) of black holes in particular .",
    "if a particle of mass @xmath148 falls to a distance r from a mass m , it obtains , in the relativistic case as well , a final velocity @xmath149 with @xmath150 , the schwartzschild radius of the mass m. in order to obtain in a `` single shot '' planckian energies , we need that @xmath151 or @xmath152 the last equation applies also if at infinity we have initially a photon of energy@xmath148 .",
    "taking generically @xmath153 and @xmath154(neutron star)=@xmath155 as the mass neutron star or black hole doing the acceleration , we find @xmath156 .",
    "the distance of closest approach @xmath157 must exceed @xmath158 , the radius of the star ( compact object ) and hence we have @xmath159 .",
    "thus the system of interest is most likely a black hole . in turn the black hole",
    "will also capture the accelerating particle .",
    "a sophisticated accelerator using repeated sling shot kicks in a system of four black holes was suggested by unruh .",
    "this beautiful concept is best illustrated in the following simple two black holes context .",

    ", the accelerated particle describes a `` semi - circle '' type trajectory around @xmath166 at @xmath167 , and is reflected around this mass by an angle @xmath168 exactly . moving then along a reflected ( @xmath169 ) trajectory the particle @xmath148 approaches the other mass @xmath170 at @xmath162 , and is reflected there by @xmath168 as well .",
    "the particle will eventually describe a closed geodesic trajectory bound to the two mass @xmath171 system .",
    "in reality the two masses move . for simplicity",
    "consider the case when the masses move towards each other with velocity @xmath172 .",
    "transforming from the rest mass of @xmath170 say to the `` lab frame '' , we find that in the reflection the energy of @xmath148 is enhanced according to @xmath173 .",
    "the last equation represents the boost due to the sling shot kick alluded to above .",
    "if we have @xmath76 such reflections , the total boost factor is @xmath174 .",
    "this overall boost could exceed @xmath175 for @xmath176 if @xmath76 exceeds @xmath177 .",
    "however , in this simple geometry the total number of reflections is limited by @xmath178 . after more reflections , the two masses will either coalesce or reverse their velocity , leading now to a deceleration of the particle @xmath148 upon each reflection .",
    "the total amplification of the initial energy is therefore limited in this case simply to a factor @xmath179 .",
    "the unruh set up involves , however , two additional heavier black holes @xmath180with @xmath181 , revolving around @xmath182 respectively , in circular orbits of equal radius @xmath81 and period @xmath183 , with @xmath184 the orbital velocity .",
    "the two orbits are assumed to lie in the @xmath185 plane with the centers of the circles at @xmath186 .",
    "the tops of the two circles , _",
    "i.e. _ the points where x is maximal , define now the original reflection centers @xmath187 .",
    "the oppositely rotating masses @xmath166 and @xmath188 are synchronized to pass at @xmath167 and @xmath162 , respectively , at the same time  once during each period t. furthermore , the motion of the accelerated mass @xmath148 is timed so as to have @xmath148 at the extreme left point on its `` stadium shaped '' orbit @xmath189 or , at the extreme right point @xmath190 , at precisely the above times .",
    "this then allows us to achieve the desired sling shot boosts , repeating once every period t. note that 2 t is now the period of the motion of the five body system @xmath191 .",
    "however , the inherent instability of this motion again limits the number @xmath76 of periods ( and of sling shot boosts ) and , as pointed to us by b. reznik , foils this ingenious device .",
    "the assumed hierarchical set - up @xmath192 can be used to approximate the angular deflection of @xmath148 while it is circulating around @xmath193 , say by @xmath194 with @xmath195 the impact parameter and @xmath196 corresponding to the turning point of closest approach . independently of the exact ( inverse eliptic function ) dependence of @xmath197 on @xmath198",

    ". the circular trajectory of m , with radius r , decays at a rate proportional to @xmath210 due to gravitational radiation .",
    "this limits @xmath211 and implies that we need a large number ( of order 100 ) reflections to achieve @xmath175 energy enhancement .",
    "this implies that in order to avoid complete orbit deterioration for the accelerating particle @xmath148 , _",
    "i.e. _ to avoid @xmath212 , we need unattainable initial precision @xmath213 , which in particular exceeds the quantum uncertainty .",
    "ultra - relativistic acceleration can be achieved in the universe as a whole ; the hubble velocities of the most distant galaxies or oldest particles , @xmath214 , are arbitrarily close to one in a sufficiently large and flat universe , though no collisions at planck cm energies can be thus engineered .",
    "it is amusing to recall one  simple \" context in which planck energies may be achieved but not much exceeded  namely the evaporating mini - black holes . indeed , as indicated in the introduction , black holes emit all elementary quanta with a thermal spectrum . only as @xmath215 does @xmath216",
    ", so that a planckian black hole would have generated planck energy quanta except for the fact that at this point @xmath217 as well , and energy conservation prevents achieving super - planckian energies .",

    "the difficulty of conceiving even gedanken super - planckian accelerators suggests that models without superplanckian elementary particles may be consistent .",
    "in particular models with light fermions may not allow acceleration to super - planckian energies when embedded into the present universe with its given hubble radius .",
    "this could not happen in an infinite or sufficiently large open universe.however the universe with its specific global parameters does provide the required violation at the present time .",
    "our discussion was clearly not exhaustive and the possibility that some ingenious suggestion ( which we failed to realize ) , can actually lead to a planck accelerator is still open .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion is presently under preparation and will address some further possibilities .",
    "let us conclude with several comments and speculations .",
    "\\a ) our considerations do not exclude theories with super - planckian energies and masses of elementary excitation.indeed the very notion of what is an elementary particle may be profoundly revised in schemes such as string theory .",
    "rather , all that is hinted is a possible consistency of theories where such a super - planckian regime is unphysical and is excluded .",
    "\\(b ) it has been suggested that ",
    "planck scale physics \" induces effective interactions violating all global symmetries .",
    "a particular example is a @xmath224 term where the @xmath225 bosons carry two units of lepton number .",
    "such a term violates @xmath226 and therefore endows the corresponding would - be massless goldstone boson ( majoron ) with a finite mass .",
    "a concrete mechanism involves the formation of a black hole in a collision of , say , @xmath227 , followed by the decay of the b.h . into @xmath228 , a final state with two units of lepton number . in this way",
    "the violation of the global quantum numbers traces back to the fundamental  no hair theorem \" for black holes .",
    "exactly as in the case of su(5 ) , where a virtual @xmath229 guts meson can mediate nucleon decay by generating effective four fermi terms , the virtual  mini black hole \" system was conjectured to induce the @xmath230 term .",
    "the estimated resulting majoron mass @xmath231 is rather high.@xcite also planckian black holes would constitute some irreducible environment and may require modification of quantum mechanics@xcite if , , the whole super - planckian domain is inaccessible for elementary excitations , it is conceivable that such effects may not be there .",
    "super - planck physics  even in terms of indirect low energy manifestation would then be completely absent .",
    "\\(c )  thooft has been emphasizing @xcite that understanding the elementary particle  black hole connection issue may lead to a more profound understanding of both field theory and gravity .",
    "our approach attempts to realize the thooft conjecture , but in a very different way . rather than try to bridge the gap between particles and black holes , we elevate such a gap  or the upper bound @xmath232 on the energy - momentum of any elementary excitation  to a fundamental postulate of the theory .",
    "the basic @xmath233 postulates , allows a qualitative understanding of the spectra and structure of atoms .",
    "our hope is that @xmath234 , will allow better understanding of elementary particles , cosmology , and their interrelations .",
    "\\(d ) as indicated above collisions of elementary particles at such energies do occur , but very rarely , with exponentially small probabilities .",
    "however , when such a collision occurs , there could be potentially dramatic repercussions .",
    "the newly formed mini black hole could be a region of a new expanding  baby universe \" where the very basic fundamental parameters may be different .",
    "indeed , we would like to suggest that _ a posteriori _ explain the rarity of such collisions , which spell the  end \" of the present universe .",
    "the new universe still preserves the same gauge group @xmath235 or a corresponding @xmath236 or @xmath237 , etc .",
    "guts group .",
    "the point is that these small length scales ( @xmath238 ) all symmetries are restored , and the  gauge hair \" is a common link between the two universes .",
    "new fermion masses and even new fermionic degrees of freedom may arise in this process , but due to the `` gauge memory ''",
    "it is natural to assume the same gauge structure for them .",
    "this could then provide an  evolutionary \" explanation for the repeating fermionic generations in the spirit of speculation by nambu@xcite and coleman@xcite .",
    "indeed , as indicated by our estimates the new generations with lighter electrons and quarks could make it more difficult to achieve super - planckian energies again in the new universe , thus allowing the long lived present universe .",
    "if fermion masses stay fixed and the universe expands for ever(which appears to be observationally more favorable at the present time)then planck accelerators would become eventually possible .",
    "the above extremely heuristic notion , could potentially also evade this difficulty .",
    "a continuous change of fundamental constants with the expansion of the universe was suggested by the dirac large number hypothesis .",
    "this clearly failed various experimental checks .",
    "our conjecture that a universe which is one billion times older than the present universe would still fail to accelerate to planck energies due to the possible emergence of a fourth superlight generation is much harder to check .",

    "<S> the inability to achieve in the present universe , via electromagnetic or gravitational acceleration , planck energies for elementary particles is suggested on the basis of several , some relatively sophisticated , failed attempts . </S>",
    "<S> this failure is essential for schemes were the superplanckian regime for the energies of elementary particles is `` unphysical''.the basic observation is that this failure to achieve superplanckian energies naturally occurs in our universe of finite age and horizon . it does tie up in a mysterious fashion these cosmological quantities and elementary physics parameters such as the masses of the lightest charged fermions </S>"
