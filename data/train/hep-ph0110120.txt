    "one of the major aims of the experiments at the hera @xmath3 collider is the measurement of the structure functions of the proton , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , over a broad range of the kinematic variables .",
    "especially the domain of small bjorken @xmath6 and momentum transfer @xmath7 of the order of a few gev@xmath8 and below is of particular interest , as it provides a challenge for attempts towards a complete , quantitative understanding of the dynamics of quarks and gluons inside the nucleon .    of these structure functions , the longitudinal one , @xmath9 , is much more difficult to access .",
    "there exist several ways to separately extract @xmath10 and @xmath9 from the experimental data .",
    "the most obvious , direct method requires to run the collider at different ( i.e. , lower ) center - of - mass energies , which may not be desirable from the point of view of other parts of the physics program .",
    "indirect methods usually require substantial input from theory and depend more or less on modeling the hadronic final state , like extrapolations or qcd fits ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , or the measurement of the azimuthal angle distribution of final state hadrons , as suggested by gehrmann @xcite .",
    "however , these methods can be used at fixed collision energy .",
    "another direct method was suggested by krasny et al .",
    "@xcite and utilizes radiative events with an exclusive hard photon registered in the forward photon detector ( pd ) .",
    "such a device is actually part of the luminosity monitoring system of the h1 and zeus experiments , and will continue to exist after the hera luminosity upgrade .",
    "the idea of this method is that emission of photons in a direction close to the incoming electron corresponds to a reduction in the effective beam energy .",
    "the effective electron energy for each radiative event is determined from the energy of the hard photon observed ( tagged ) in the pd .    besides measuring @xmath9 , radiative events",
    "extend the accessible kinematic range to lower values of @xmath7 .",
    "the potential of this method is supported by preliminary results from the h1 collaboration of an analysis at low @xmath7 for @xmath10 @xcite ( for earlier analyses that did not take into account qed radiative corrections see @xcite ) .",
    "the feasibility of the corresponding determination of @xmath9 was studied in @xcite . however , with currently analyzed data sets it is not yet possible to compete with @xmath9 from extrapolations or qcd fits @xcite .",
    "a precise analysis of experimental data requires the inclusion of radiative corrections .",
    "the most important ones are the qed corrections on the lepton side that have been discussed at the leading logarithmic level @xcite and taking into account next - to - leading logarithms @xcite . as the difference between leading and next -",
    "to - leading logarithmic terms could be quite significant , reaching of the order of 5 percent in some regions , it appears difficult to estimate the remaining uncertainty due to non - logarithmic terms .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to close this particular gap .",
    "we may focus on the qed corrections on the lepton side since they form a gauge invariant subset of the full corrections to the process under consideration .",
    "furthermore , one expects that the qed corrections on the hadronic side are significantly smaller , as the typical hadronic mass scale of the order of the proton mass is much larger than the electron mass , so there is no comparably large logarithm .",
    "in fact , emission of photons off quarks can essentially be absorbed into suitably defined parton distribution functions , and the net effect turns out to be numerically negligible @xcite .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . after introducing our notation in section 2 , we devote section 3 to a discussion of the individual contributions to the leptonic corrections with forward photon tagging , and apply these corrections in section 4 to the case of radiative deep inelastic scattering . in section 5",
    "we present some numerical results and our conclusions .",
    "the appendices collect several formulae that are useful for a numerical implementation of our calculation .",
    "a a starting point , let us introduce our notation in the context of the lowest order contribution to the radiative , semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering process @xmath11 where the photon @xmath12 is assumed to be measured in the photon detector .",
    "we choose invariant kinematic variables that use the measured , scattered electron and take into account the energy loss due to photon emission @xcite , @xmath13    for hera conditions , the polar angle @xmath14 of the tagged photon ( as measured with respect to the incident electron beam ) will be very small , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being about 0.45  mrad in the case of the pd of h1",
    ". we shall also assume below that the scattering angle of the electron , @xmath17 , is always much larger than @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the energy fraction of the electron after initial state radiation reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electron beam energy , @xmath20 represents the energy deposited in the forward pd , and @xmath21 .",
    "the relation between the shifted variables ( [ eq : kin - vars ] ) and the standard bjorken variables of deep inelastic scattering reads : @xmath22    the born cross section , integrated over the solid angle of the photon detector ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) takes a factorized form , @xmath25 with @xmath26    f_2(\\hat{x},\\hat{q}^2 ) \\ ; ,    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath27    the obvious advantage of the use of shifted variables ( [ eq : kin - vars ] ) is their direct appearance in the argument of the structure functions in the born cross section .",
    "in the expression for the lowest order cross section , eq .",
    "( [ eq : born ] ) , we encountered the logarithm @xmath28 of the quantity @xmath29 although @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the conditions of the hera pd s . we shall therefore consistently neglect contributions that are of order @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the subset of leptonic qed corrections is gauge invariant , and it also factorizes , thus allowing a discussion isolated from the hadronic part .",
    "besides keeping things more transparent , this also facilitates reusing the results in other calculations .    in the present section",
    ", we shall therefore consider the compton subprocess @xmath35 with the emission angle of the photon being integrated over the pd , while taking into account the corrections from virtual and real qed corrections . while performing this integration , we require that the remaining part of the amplitude for the full process ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) depends only weakly on the small transverse momentum of the forward photon .",
