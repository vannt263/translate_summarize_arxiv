    "the theoretical description of hadronic weak decays is difficult due to nonperturbative strong - interaction dynamics .",
    "this affects the interpretation of data collected at the @xmath0 factories , and in many cases limits our ability to uncover the origin of cp violation and search for new physics .",
    "the complexity of the problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlep ] .",
    "it is well known how to control the effects of hard gluons with virtuality between the electroweak scale @xmath5 and the scale @xmath6 characteristic to the decays of interest .",
    "they can be dealt with by constructing a low - energy effective weak hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 are products of ckm matrix elements , @xmath9 are calculable short - distance coefficients , and @xmath10 are local operators renormalized at a scale @xmath11 . the challenge is to calculate the hadronic matrix elements of these operators with controlled theoretical uncertainties , using a systematic approximation scheme .",
    "= 6.0 cm    previous field - theoretic attempts to evaluate these matrix elements have employed dynamical schemes such as lattice field theory , qcd sum rules , or the hard - scattering approach .",
    "the first two have difficulties in accounting for final - state rescattering , which however is important for predicting direct cp asymmetries .",
    "the hard - scattering approach misses the leading soft contribution to the @xmath12 transition form factors and thus falls short of reproducing the correct magnitude of the decay amplitudes . in view of these difficulties , most previous analyses of hadronic decays",
    "have employed phenomenological models such as `` naive '' or `` generalized factorization '' , in which the complicated matrix elements of four - quark operators in the effective weak hamiltonian are replaced , in an _ ad hoc _ way , by products of current matrix elements .",
    "corrections to this approximation are accounted for by introducing a set of phenomenological parameters @xmath13 .",
    "a different strategy is to classify nonleptonic decay amplitudes according to flavor topologies ( `` trees '' and `` penguins '' ) , which can be decomposed into su(3 ) or isospin amplitudes .",
    "this leads to relations between decay amplitudes in the flavor - symmetry limit .",
    "no attempt is made to compute these amplitudes from first principles .",
    "here we summarize recent progress in the theoretical understanding of nonleptonic decay amplitudes in the heavy - quark limit @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is to exploit the presence of a large scale , i.e. , the fact that @xmath14 . in order to disentangle the physics associated with these two scales , we factorize and compute hard contributions to the decay amplitudes arising from gluons with virtuality of order @xmath15 , and parameterize soft and collinear contributions . considering the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlep ] , we denote by @xmath16 the meson that absorbs the spectator quark of the @xmath0 meson , and by @xmath17 the meson at the upper vertex , to which we refer as the `` emission particle '' .",
    "we find that at leading power in @xmath18 all long - distance contributions to the decay amplitudes can be factorized into semileptonic form factors and meson light - cone distribution amplitudes , which are much simpler quantities than the nonleptonic amplitudes themselves . a graphical representation of the resulting `` factorization formula ''",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theorem ] . the physical picture underlying",
    "factorization is color transparency @xcite .",
    "if the emission particle is a light meson , its constituents carry large energy of order @xmath15 and are nearly collinear .",
    "soft gluons coupling to this system see only its net zero color charge and hence decouple .",
    "interactions with the color dipole of the small @xmath19-pair are power suppressed in the heavy - quark limit",
    ".    for @xmath0 decays into final states containing a heavy charm meson and a light meson , the factorization formula takes the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an operator in the effective weak hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , @xmath22 are transition form factors ( evaluated at @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the decay constant and leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitude of the light meson , and @xmath26 are process - dependent hard - scattering kernels . for",
    "decays into final states containing two light mesons there is a second type of contribution to the factorization formula , which involves a hard interaction with the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this is shown by the second graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : theorem ] .",
    "below we focus first on @xmath27 decays ( with @xmath2 a light meson ) , where this second term is power suppressed and can be neglected .",
    "decays into two light final - state mesons are more complicated  @xcite and will be discussed briefly in sect .",
    "[ sec : pik ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the factorization formula for nonleptonic decays provides a model - independent basis for the analysis of these processes in an expansion in powers and logarithms of @xmath18 . at leading power , but to all orders in @xmath28 , the decay amplitudes assume the factorized form shown in ( [ fff ] ) .",
    "having such a formalism based on power counting in @xmath18 is of great importance to the theoretical description of hadronic weak decays , since it provides a well - defined limit of qcd in which these processes admit a rigorous , theoretical description .",
    "( for instance , the possibility to compute systematically @xmath29 corrections to `` naive factorization '' , which emerges as the leading term in the heavy - quark limit , solves the old problem of renormalization - scale and scheme dependences of nonleptonic amplitudes . ) the usefulness of this new scheme may be compared with the usefulness of the heavy - quark effective theory for the analysis of exclusive semileptonic decays of heavy mesons , or of the heavy - quark expansion for the analysis of inclusive decay rates . in all three cases ,",
    "it is the fact that hadronic uncertainties can be eliminated up to power corrections in @xmath18 that has advanced our ability to control theoretical errors .    it must be stressed , however , that we are just beginning to explore the theory of nonleptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "some important conceptual problems remain to be better understood . in the next few years it will be important to further develop the approach .",
    "this should include an all - orders proof of factorization at leading power , the development of a formalism for dealing with power corrections to factorization , understanding the light - cone structure of heavy mesons , and understanding the relevance ( or irrelevance ) of sudakov form factors . also , we must gauge the accuracy of the approach by learning about the magnitude of corrections to the heavy - quark limit from extensive comparisons of theoretical predictions with data .",
    "as experience with previous heavy - quark expansions has shown , this is going to be a long route . yet , already we have obtained important insights . before turning to specific applications ,",
    "let me mention three points here :    \\1 .",
    "corrections to `` naive factorization '' ( usually called `` nonfactorizable effects '' ) are process dependent , in contrast with a basic assumption underlying models of `` generalized factorization '' .",
    "the physics of nonleptonic decays is both rich and complicated .",
    "there may , in general , be an interplay of several small parameters ( wilson coefficients , ckm factors , @xmath30 , etc . ) in addition to the small parameter @xmath18 relevant to qcd factorization .",
    "also , several not - so - well - known input parameters ( e.g. , heavy - to - light form factors and light - cone distribution amplitudes ) introduce numerical uncertainties .",
    "strong rescattering phases arising from final - state interactions are suppressed in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "more precisely , the imaginary parts of nonleptonic decay amplitudes are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath31 or @xmath18 . at leading power",
    ", the phases are calculable from the imaginary parts of the hard - scattering kernels in the factorization formula .",
    "a generic consequence is that direct cp asymmetries in hadronic @xmath0 decays are suppressed in the heavy - quark limit , except for cases where for some reason the real part of the decay amplitude is also suppressed .",

    "( [ heffa1 ] ) defines the quantities @xmath37 , which include the leading `` nonfactorizable '' corrections , in a renormalization - group invariant way . to leading power in @xmath18 these quantities",
    "should not be interpreted as phenomenological parameters ( as is usually done ) , because they are dominated by hard gluon exchange and thus calculable in qcd . at next - to - leading order in @xmath28",

    "the exact expression for this function is known but not relevant here .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 are nonuniversal , i.e. , they are explicitly dependent on the nature of the final - state mesons .",
    "politzer and wise have computed the `` nonfactorizable '' vertex corrections to the decay rate ratio of @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this requires the symmetric part ( with respect to @xmath48 ) of the difference @xmath49 .",
    "we agree with their result .",
    "the expressions for the decay amplitudes obtained by evaluating the hadronic matrix elements of the transition operator @xmath50 involve products of ckm matrix elements , light - meson decay constants , @xmath51 transition form factors , and the qcd parameters @xmath37 .",
    "a numerical analysis shows that @xmath52 for the decays considered below @xcite . below we will use this as our central value",
    "a particularly clean test of our predictions is obtained by relating the @xmath53 decay rates to the differential semileptonic @xmath54 decay rate evaluated at @xmath55 . in this way",
    "the parameters @xmath56 can be measured directly , since @xcite @xmath57 with our result for @xmath58 this relation becomes a prediction based on first principles of qcd .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the usual interpretation of this formula , where @xmath58 plays the role of a phenomenological parameter that is fitted from data .    using results reported by the cleo collaboration @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath59 in good agreement with our prediction .",
    "it is reassuring that the data show no evidence for large power corrections to our results .",
    "however , a further improvement in the experimental accuracy would be desirable in order to become sensitive to process - dependent , nonfactorizable effects .",
    "we now consider a larger set of so - called class - i decays of the form @xmath32 , all of which are governed by the transition operator ( [ heffa1 ] ) . in tab .",
    "[ tab:10decays ] we compare the qcd factorization predictions with experimental data .",
    "as previously we work in the heavy - quark limit , i.e. , our predictions are model independent up to corrections suppressed by at least one power of @xmath18 .",
    "there is good agreement between our predictions and the data within experimental errors , which however are still large",
    ". it would be desirable to reduce these errors to the percent level .",
    "( note that we have not attempted to adjust the semileptonic form factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 entering our results so as to obtain a best fit to the data . )",

    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the observation that the experimental data on class - i decays into heavy ",
    "light final states show good agreement with our predictions may be taken as ( circumstantial ) evidence that in these decays there are no unexpectedly large power corrections . in our recent work @xcite",
    "we have addressed the important question of power corrections theoretically by providing estimates for two sources of power - suppressed effects : weak annihilation and spectator interactions .",
    "a complete account of power corrections to the heavy - quark limit can at present not be performed in a systematic way , since these effects are no longer dominated by hard gluon exchange .",
    "however , we believe that our estimates are nevertheless instructive .",
    "we parameterize the annihilation contribution to the @xmath46 decay amplitude in terms of an amplitude @xmath63 such that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the `` tree topology '' , which contains the dominant factorizable contribution .",
    "we find that @xmath66 .",
    "we have also obtained an estimate of nonfactorizable spectator interactions , which are part of @xmath65 , finding that @xmath67 . in both cases ,",
    "the results exhibit the expected linear power suppression in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "we conclude that the typical size of power corrections in class - i decays into heavy ",
    "light final states is at the level of 10% or less , and thus our predictions for the values and the near universality of the parameters @xmath58 governing these decay modes appear robust .",
    "the observation of rare charmless @xmath0 decays into @xmath68 and @xmath69 final states has resulted in a large amount of theoretical and phenomenological work that attempts to interpret these observations in terms of the factorization approximation , or in terms of general parameterizations of the decay amplitudes .",
    "a detailed understanding of these amplitudes would help us to pin down the value of the ckm angle @xmath70 using only data on cp - averaged branching fractions .",
    "here we briefly summarize the most important consequences of the qcd factorization approach for the @xmath68 and @xmath71 final states @xcite .    to leading order in an expansion in powers of @xmath18 , the @xmath3 matrix elements obey the factorization formula shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theorem ] : @xmath72 where the @xmath73-products imply an integration over the light - cone momentum fractions of the constituent quarks inside the mesons .",
    "our results are based on hard - scattering kernels including all corrections of order @xmath28 .",
    "compared to our previous discussion of @xmath4 decays @xcite , the present analysis incorporates three new ingredients : the matrix elements of electroweak penguin operators ( for @xmath68 modes ) , hard - scattering kernels for asymmetric light - cone distributions , and the complete set of `` chirally enhanced '' @xmath74 corrections .",
    "the second and third items have not been considered in other generalizations of ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath68 final states @xcite . the third one , in particular , is essential for estimating some of the theoretical uncertainties of the approach . for completeness",
    ", we note that the predictions from qcd factorization differ in essential aspects from those obtained in the conventional hard - scattering approach @xcite .",
    "= 13.6 cm    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have obtained the coefficients @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 ) of the effective , factorized `` transition operator '' defined analogously to the case of @xmath4 decays , but augmented by coefficients related to electroweak penguin contributions .",
    "chirally enhanced corrections arise from twist-3 two - particle light - cone distribution amplitudes , whose normalization involves the quark condensate .",
    "the relevant parameter , @xmath77 , is formally of order @xmath18 , but large numerically .",
    "the coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 are multiplied by this parameter .",
    "there are also additional chirally enhanced corrections to the spectator - interaction term in ( [ fact ] ) , which turn out to be the more important effect .",
    "these latter corrections involve a logarithmically divergent integral , which violates factorization .",
    "for instance , for matrix elements of @xmath80 operators the hard spectator interaction is proportional to ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) @xmath83 when the spectator quark goes to the pion .",
    "( here we used that the twist-3 distribution amplitudes can be taken to be the asymptotic ones when one neglects twist-3 corrections without the chiral enhancement . ) the divergence of the @xmath84-integral in the second term as @xmath85 implies that it is dominated by soft gluon exchange between the spectator quark and the quarks that form the kaon .",
    "we therefore treat the divergent integral @xmath86 as an unknown parameter , which may in principle be complex owing to soft rescattering in higher orders . in our numerical analysis",
    "we set @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is chosen randomly inside a circle in the complex plane of radius 3 ( `` realistic '' ) or 6 ( `` conservative '' ) .",
    "our results also depend on the @xmath0-meson parameter @xcite @xmath89 , which we vary between 0.2 and 0.5gev .",
    "finally , there is in some cases a nonnegligible dependence of the coefficients @xmath75 on the renormalization scale , which we vary between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we take @xmath92 and @xmath93mev as fixed input to our analysis , noting that ultimately these standard model parameters , along with the cp - violating phase @xmath94 , might be extracted from a simultaneous fit to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay rates .",
    "we now summarize our main results .",
    "bounds on @xmath94 derived from ratios of cp - averaged @xmath3 decay rates @xcite , as well as the determination of @xmath94 using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , rely on an estimate of su(3 ) flavor - symmetry violations .",
    "we find that `` nonfactorizable '' su(3)-breaking effects ( i.e. , effects not accounted for by the different decay constants and form factors of pions and kaons in the conventional factorization approximation ) do not exceed the level of a few percent .      the approach discussed here allows us to calculate the amplitudes for @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays in terms of form factors and light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "we focus on decays whose branching ratios have already been measured .",
    "since the relevant form factor @xmath95 is not well known , we consider only ratios of cp - averaged branching ratios .",
    "we display these as functions of the weak phase @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for comparison",
    ", we show the data on the various ratios obtained using results reported by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "we also indicate the very recent results reported by the babar and belle collaborations at the ichep2000 conference @xcite . from the plots it is apparent that the corrections with respect to the conventional factorization approximation are significant ( and important to reduce the renormalization - scale dependence ) . despite this fact , we find that the _ qualitative _ pattern emerging for the set of @xmath3 and @xmath69 decay modes is similar to that in conventional factorization . in particular , the penguin ",

    ". it will be interesting to follow how the comparison between data and theory develops as the data become more precise .",
    "the stability of the prediction for the @xmath96 amplitude suggests that the ckm angle @xmath106 can be extracted from the time - dependent mixing - induced cp asymmetry in this decay mode , without using an isospin analysis .",

    "a consistency check of the approach could be obtained , in principle , from the coefficient of the @xmath113 term , which is given by the direct cp asymmetry in this decay .",
    "with the recent commissioning of the @xmath0 factories and the planned emphasis on heavy - flavor physics in future collider experiments , the role of @xmath0 decays in providing fundamental tests of the standard model and potential signatures of new physics will continue to grow .",
