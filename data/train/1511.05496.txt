    "exploration of comets with space missions is critical to probe the coma and to access the detailed features of a cometary nucleus .",
    "however , remote spectroscopic observations can provide ample information about the global composition of comets . the coma composition associated with main species",
    "can be constrained from the analysis of airglow emissions using ground- and space - based telescopes .",
    "this nevertheless requires the quantitative assessment of physical processes that govern these emissions in the coma .    among many observed cometary ultraviolet and visible airglow spectra",
    ", metastable emission lines have gained special interest .",
    "solar resonance fluorescence is not an effective excitation mechanism to populate excited metastable states in the coma due to optically forbidden transitions .",
    "the dissociative excitation by photons , suprathermal electrons such as photoelectrons , and thermal recombination of ions are the main channels for producing various species in metastable excited states . by observing the emissions from the daughter products , which are particularly from metastable state ,",
    "the estimation of mixing ratios of their respective parent species has been done in several comets @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of a metastable excited species is shorter ( @xmath10.7 s for o(@xmath2s ) , @xmath1110 s for o(@xmath2d ) , and @xmath13 ms for co(a@xmath3 ) ) compared to their respective parent species ( e.g. , for h@xmath0o  it is @xmath18  @xmath4  10@xmath5  s@xmath6 at 1 au ) , and can not travel large radial distances in the coma from the place of formation without being lost through the emission of photons or quenched in collision .",
    "hence , these forbidden emissions are good tracers to quantify the gas production rates of respective parent species in the coma .",
    "though water is the dominant species in comets , it is very difficult to access cometary h@xmath0o  infrared emissions from ground - based observatories because of strong absorption by terrestrial water molecules .",
    "however , the spatial profiles of cometary h@xmath0o  have been observed by ground - based telescopes by observing non - resonance fluorescence emissions @xcite .",
    "since h@xmath0o  does not have any transitions in ultraviolet and visible regions , the forbidden emissions of its dissociative metastable products ( [ oi ] 6300 , 6364 , 5577 , 2972   ) have been used as tracers .",
    "oxygen atoms that are produced in the @xmath2s state , decay 95% of the time to the @xmath2d state emitting photons at 5577    ( green line ) wavelength , while 5% of them decay directly to the ground @xmath7p state which yields 2972 and 2958    emission lines .",
    "the radiative decay of @xmath2d @xmath8p leads to 6300 and 6364    emission lines ( red - doublet emission ) .",
    "thus , if the green line is present in a cometary spectrum , the red - doublet must also be present , although the red - doublet can be formed without the green line . the quantification of h@xmath0o  in the cometary coma has been done by observing [ oi ] 6300    emission in many comets @xcite .",
    "the direct de - excitation of o(@xmath2s )  yields 2972    emission line which has been observed in cometary spectrum only once @xcite .",
    "since there are other oxygen bearing species , such as co@xmath0  and co , which can also produce these metastable states via dissociative excitation reactions , the observed green to red - doublet emission intensity ratio ( hereafter referred as g / r ratio ) has been used to confirm the parent source of these emission lines @xcite .",
    "based on o(@xmath2s )  and o(@xmath2d )  photorates calculated by @xcite , the observed high g / r ratio  values ( @xmath9 0.1 ) were ascribed to large co@xmath0  and co volume mixing ratios in the coma @xcite .",
    "the spin forbidden atomic oxygen emission line [ oi ] 1356    has also been detected using rocket- and space - borne uv spectrometers in comets @xcite .",
    "since fluorescence efficiency ( g - factor ) for this transition is small to explain the observed intensity , production sources for this emission are attributed to electron impact excitation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "@xcite accounted for various electron impact excitation sources to explain the observed emission intensity in comet halley , which had gas production rate of 1.3  @xmath4  10@xmath10  s@xmath6 at 1 au .",
    "co@xmath0  is also an important oxygen bearing species in the cometary coma but is difficult to detect directly in the visible and ultraviolet cometary spectra because of the lack of electronic transitions . in order to quantify co@xmath0  in comets , co cameron band emissions (",

    "* ) originate primarily from photodissociation of co@xmath0   @xcite .",
    "this spin - forbidden electron transition ( a@xmath3 @xmath11 a@xmath12 ) yields a band emission in the ultraviolet spectral range 18002600   . using hubble space telescope ( hst ) , @xcite detected this band emission on comet 103p / hartley 2 .",

    "the excited state of this emission is a metastable state c(@xmath2d ) which has a lifetime of about 4080 s @xcite . the radiative decay of carbon from @xmath2d to the ground @xmath7p state results in photons at 9823 and 9850   , which are analogous to atomic oxygen red - doublet emissions at 6300 and 6464   .",
    "the [ ci ] 9850    emission line has been detected in comet hale - bopp by @xcite .",
    "the carbon atom in @xmath2d metastable state fluoresces the solar photons at 1931    before radiative decay to the ground @xmath7p state can occur .",
    "most of the emission line intensity is attributed to photodissociative excitation of co in comets @xcite .",
    "hence this emission line is a good tracer for co production rate in comets @xcite .",
    "the model developed by @xcite calculated this emission line intensity in comet halley , which is smaller by a factor 5 than that observed by iue , and suggested an involvement of additional carbon - bearing species in the coma .    in order to derive the parent species production rates in the coma based on the observed forbidden emission intensities",

    "<S> the results presented in this work serve as base line calculations to understand the behaviour of low out - gassing cometary coma and compare them with the higher gas production rate cases ( e.g. comet halley ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative analysis of different excitation processes governing the spectroscopic emissions is essential to study the chemistry of inner coma and to derive neutral gas composition . </S>"
