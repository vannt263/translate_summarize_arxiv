    "given human - kind s search for life in the universe , there is great motivation to find earth - size and earth - mass planets in the habitable zones of stars .",
    "recent studies have determined that earth size planets are common around m - dwarfs .",
    "@xcite estimate an occurrence rate of 1.5 planets per m - dwarf with periods less than 90 days and radii larger than 0.5r@xmath11 , using the list of 4000 stars with temperatures below 4000 k assembled in @xcite that were observed with the _ kepler _ mission @xcite .",
    "this estimate is consistent with but slightly higher than previous studies , which measure occurance rates of approximately one planet per m - dwarf @xcite .",
    "given the apparent abundance of earth - size planets orbiting m - dwarfs , which dominate the stellar population ( 75@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite predict the nearest non - transiting planet in the habitable zone orbiting an m - dwarf is within 5 pc of th sun , with 95@xmath12 confidence .",
    "however , how suitable these nearby planets within the classically defined habitable zone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be for life is still under debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , given their ubiquity and proximity , m - dwarfs are ideal stars to search for earth - size and earth - mass planets in stellar habitable zones .",
    "m - dwarfs have been favorite targets of precision searches for low mass planets , because a planetary companion will induce a greater reflex motion on a low mass star than a sun - like star , making it easier to detect . however , not all m - dwarfs are equally suitable targets for the precision measurements needed to find earth - mass companions .",
    "some m - dwarfs have close stellar or substellar companions that may inhibit the detection of earth - mass planets .",
    "the dynamically disruptive effects of these companions could also preclude the existence of earth - mass planets ; the lack of short period giant planets in multiple planet systems corroborates this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "some m - stars also exhibit high chromospheric activity and large rotational velocities , which can hinder the achievable rv precision @xcite ; this is especially problematic for mid to late ( m3 and cooler ) m - dwarfs .",
    "given the above considerations , we argue that the best stars to target for earth - mass planet searches are likely the lowest mass stars ( mid to late m - dwarfs ) that do not have a disruptive companion , and are both inactive and slowly rotating .    yet , the statistics characterizing companions around mid to late m - dwarfs are still incomplete .",
    "preliminary surveys show that jupiter - mass companions are rare around m - dwarfs . using radial velocity ( rv ) measurements and high contrast imaging",
    ", @xcite found that 6.5@xmath03.0@xmath12 of m - dwarfs ( m0-m5.5 ) host a giant planet ( 1 - 13 m@xmath10 ) with a semi - major axis smaller than 20 au , but this sample only included 18 m - dwarfs of m4 or later in their survey of 111 m - dwarfs .",
    "another large m - dwarf survey of 102 stars @xcite only included m - dwarfs with v@xmath1314 and finds the giant planet ( @xmath14sin@xmath15 = 100 - 1000 m@xmath11 ) frequency to be 2@xmath12 for orbital periods between 10 and 100 days , and the super - earth ( @xmath14sin@xmath15 = 1 - 10 m@xmath11 ) frequency with orbital periods between 10 and 100 days to be significantly higher at 52@xmath12 .",
    "many of the m - dwarfs not surveyed are faint and chromospherically active , which limits the achievable rv precision and chances to find earth - mass planets . as a result , these two surveys , which are representative of other spectroscopic m - dwarf surveys , include very few mid to late m - dwarfs and can report only preliminary statistics for planet occurrence around such stars .    in order to obtain an unbiased assessment of the companion fraction of the nearest mid m - dwarfs",

    "after determining its location , we integrate both the continuum and spectrum over 22 , with the central wavelength corresponding to the h@xmath6 line to determine the equivalent width . upon visual inspection of the spectra , we could not reliably determine emission or absorption lines smaller than 0.5 .",
    "therefore , we conservatively use this number as the error value on the h@xmath6 measurements , which are given in table  [ table : halpha ] ; we adopt the standard convention of denoting emission with a negative sign .",
    "if any star exhibits h@xmath6 equivalent widths less than the the typical noise level of 0.5  in at least one epoch , we categorized it as an emission - line star .",

    "we classify 35/58 of the stars from the caesar sample as emission - line stars .",
    "we also note that the fraction of emission - line stars increases with later spectral type .",
    "37% of the 35 stars with spectral types m4 or earlier are emission - line stars , whereas 100% of the 9 stars with spectral type m6 or later are emission - line stars .",
    "our fraction of early m - dwarfs with emission is comparable to that of @xcite who find 41% of the 115 stars m3 to m4.5 to be active emission - line stars .",
    "likewise , @xcite reports an increase in emission - line stars with lower mass and finds 100% of the m7 stars are emission - line stars .",
    "he also notes that this trend breaks down past m7 and that the fraction of later type stars that show chromospheric activity is significantly less .      to assess the surface gravity of these stars , as a possible tracer of their evolutionary states , the gravity sensitive @xmath7 doublet ( defined in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is measured ; this feature is well known to be weak in giants and strong in dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for the @xmath7 doublet index , we use the wavelength region between 8148  and 8200 .",

    "these values are given in table  [ table : halpha ] . while these indices derived from the low - resolution spectra",
    "are a good indicator of the evolutionary state of the star , high - resolution spectra are needed to ascertain a more quantitative measure of the surface gravity .",
    "also , we do caution that these lines can be affected by metallicity and stellar activity ; metal poor stars and chromospherically active stars will systematically have lower equivalent widths ( ew ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all of the stars in the ensemble sample exhibit average @xmath7 doublet indices in a typical range for main sequence stars ( @xmath221.1 ; * ? ? ?",

    "this is denoted by adding a ` v ' to the spectral type listed in table  [ table : sample ] .",
    "prior to our measurements , four of the 58 stars from caesar sample did not have complete sets of _ v _ , _ r _ and _ i _ photometry .",
    "the remaining stars had photometric measurements presented in eight different publications . therefore , to establish a uniform , homogenous , set of photometric measurements for the ensemble sample of 58 stars , we obtained optical photometric observations using the 0.9-m telescope at ctio .",

    "we present results of a 3d companion search on a sub - sample of 12 caesar stars , including g 99 - 49 , gj 300 , gj 406 , gj 555 , gj 628 , gj 729 , gj 1002 , gj 1065 , gj 1224 , gj 1286 , lhs 1723 , and lhs 3799 , which are the most data - rich in our sample .",
    "the remaining stars in the ensemble sample will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "these twelve stars have astrometry baselines , ranging from 9 to over 13 years , and have at least 5 infrared radial velocity measurements spanning from almost 2 weeks to 5 years .",

    ". the design resolving power is 100,000 per pixel .",
    "we use cshell in the high resolution mode ( 0.5@xmath2 slit=2.5 pixels ) , which yields a predicted spectral resolving power of r @xmath8 40,000 .",
    "the measured resolving power determined from the model fits to telluric absorption features ( described later ) is @xmath857,000 .",
    "this number is significantly higher than the predicted resolving power for cshell using the 0.5@xmath2 slit .",
    "we note this discrepancy because cshell has an adjustable slit ; it may be that the slit is smaller than the designed 0.5@xmath2 . @xcite and @xcite also report a higher than predicted spectral resolving power ( r@xmath846,000 ) for cshell in high resolution mode . also , we note a similar effect of determining a higher spectral resolving power for keck is determined in @xcite , and may be a feature of the analysis code .",
    "each night , two spectra of a given star were obtained in succession at two different positions along the slit , separated by 10@xmath2 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these two positions as nod a and nod b. observations were obtained between 2008 november and 2014 january .",
    "our exposure times ranged from 180 to 1200 seconds per nod position , and were set to yield snrs of 125 per pixel ( or optimally , a combined snr of 175 + ) for most of our targets . for the faintest three stars ( _ k@xmath19 _ @xmath22 8.0 ) in our sample of 12 stars ( gj 1065 , gj 1224 , gj 1286 ) , a snr of 125 per pixel was not achieved as the maximum exposure time is set to 1200 seconds to limit cosmic ray events and the dark current .",
    "at the beginning of each night , we obtained a minimum of 30 flat and 30 dark images each with an integration time of ten seconds . also , on november 14 , 2009 , we collected an additional 30 flat and 30 dark images with an integration time of 20 seconds , which were used in creating a bad pixel mask described in  6.2 .",
    "most nights we also observed bright stars of spectral type early a , as these stars exhibit no intrinsic absorption or emission lines in this wavelength region and therefore can be used to identify telluric features .",
    "these telluric standards are used to characterize the instrumental profile and wavelength solution .",
    "when first collecting the data , we did not realize how sensitive our final rv measurements were to the initial solutions for the instrumental profile and wavelength solution obtained from the telluric standards . after reducing part of the data",
    ", we determined that a star observations obtained nightly yield the best precision . in a few cases",
    ", we only obtained a few a star observations per run leaving us with four nights that contain no a star observations .",
    "the four nights the telluric standards were not observed are marked in table  [ table : rv ] by an asterisk next to the date .",
    "we aimed to observe each target at least four nights within a single observing run ( @xmath8 1@xmath173 weeks ) in order to search for companions with orbital periods of less than a week . because of inclement weather we were not able to achieve this cadence for all targets . on subsequent runs ,",
    "we re - observed our targets at least once to search for companions with longer orbital periods , except for gj 1065 . for the sample of 12 stars studied here",
    ", we obtained between 5@xmath1712 rv epochs for each star , spanning a temporal baseline between 13 days and 1884 days ( see table  [ table : rv ] ) .",
    "we subtracted each nodded pair of images from one another to remove sky emission , dark current and detector bias assuming that changes in the detector or spectrograph properties were negligible over the timescale when the nodded pair of images were obtained . after completing the nod - subtraction",
    ", we corrected each image for flat fielding .",
    "corrections for flat fielding were performed by generating a nightly master flat field image from all flat field images obtained on a particular night .",
    "the master flat field images were created by first subtracting the median dark image of the same exposure time from each of the flat field images .",
    "then , each flat field image was normalized to the central 15@xmath12 of the array , which was the brightest section of the array and the least affected by deviant pixels .",
    "after normalizing the image , all images were median combined .",
    "we then applied a bad pixel mask to our spectra to remove dead and hot pixels from the data . to identify dead pixels , we located any pixel five times below the standard deviation of the median pixel value of the master flat field array .",
    "to locate hot pixels , we subtracted two times the count value of the 10 second exposure master flat field image from the 20 second exposure master flat field image , and then normalized this number to the 20 second exposure master flat field . because these pixels should increase linearly with time and therefore have the same values , we identified any pixel with values greater than three times the standard deviation of this median pixel value of the difference image to be a hot pixel .",
    "all deviant pixels identified from the bad pixel mask are assigned interpolated values using the neighboring pixels .",
    "we optimally extracted each spectrum following the procedures in @xcite as implemented for nod - subtracted spectra in @xcite .",
    "the code used to analyze the data in this work is a modified version of that described in @xcite , tuned to work for cshell data .",
    "the advantage of optimally extracting spectra over the standard extraction is that the optimal extraction minimizes the noisy contribution of the profile wings and eliminates and/or mitigates noise features within the spectral profile caused by cosmic rays and deviant pixels not excluded with the bad pixel mask .    to obtain an optimally extracted spectrum , we summed the pixels from the nod subtracted images over the cross - dispersion to give the standard spectrum .",
    "we then fitted a second order polynomial to map the curvature of the order on the detector .",
    "next , we fitted the spectral profile of the standard spectrum with a gaussian to model our spatial profiles at each pixel step ( column ) along the order parallel to the dispersion direction of the nod - subtracted spectral image . from this , the variance of the profile was determined .",
    "then , we summed the pixels weighted by the variance image of the spectrum s spatial profile to create our two dimensional optimally extracted spectrum .",
    "for low snr data , we implemented a clipping routine that interpolates over a pixel that is more than 5@xmath25 above or below the running average of the five pixels next to the pixel in question to remove any remaining deviant features .    to obtain an estimate of the snr for each spectrum , we use a simplified version of the ccd equation from @xcite modified to account for the noise introduced by subtracting pairs of images .",
    "when performing a nod pair subtraction we remove the sky background , dark current and bias simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we can not distinguish between these values and refer to them collectively as the uncertainty in background . executing",
    "a pair subtraction means that we have to deal with this uncertainty in the background twice and the read noise associated with each of those background estimates . in most cases ,",
    "the background of the first image ( image a ) should equal ( within the uncertainty ) the background of the second image ( image b ) . therefore ,",
    "we simply double the noise contribution from the background and the read noise .",
    "the equation to calculate the snr per pixel is as follows :    @xmath26    where s@xmath27 is the total number of counts per integrated column of a spectrum extracted from a nod - subtracted image in electrons , n is the number of pixels in the spatial direction that are integrated over during the extraction , b@xmath27 is the integrated background counts of the corresponding sky image before image subtraction is performed , in electrons per pixel , and r@xmath27@xmath28 is the read noise set to be 30 electrons / pixel from @xcite .    following the above description , we determine the snr for each integrated pixel of the spectrum and set the final snr for the spectrum to be the mean of these values .",
    "the snrs are then added in quadrature for the nod a and nod b measurements to give a combined snr value .",
    "because of occasional poor weather conditions leading to low snr , not all observations are suitable for precision rv analysis .",
    "we require the snr of the individual spectrum in the nod pair to be greater than 50 and the reduced @xmath29@xmath28 estimate of our modeling prescription (  6.3 ) to be below 3.5 .",
    "we fit each observation to high resolution spectral models that are convolved to the resolution of cshell .",

    "the telluric model spectra are extracted from observations of the sun from an ultra high resolution kpno / fts telluric spectrum @xcite .",
    "we adopt the stellar template closest in temperature to our star , using the assigned spectral types and the temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "we fix the surface gravity log(g ) to 4.8 dex ( cgs ) for all of our stars , which is consistent with measurements assembled in @xcite and @xcite for field m - dwarfs .",
    "the model spectrum consists of 19 free parameters to fit .",
    "the linear limb darkening coefficient is set to 0.6 for all stars , which is appropriate for cool stars at infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "three of the parameters make up a quadratic polynomial that characterizes the wavelength solution .",
    "nine of the parameters are gaussians used to model the line spread function ( lsf ) of the spectrum ; we assume that the lsf along the order is constant .",
    "the remaining six parameters are the depth of the telluric features , the depth of the stellar features , the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath20sin@xmath15 ) , the rv , a normalization constant , and a linear normalization term .",
    "we fit the empirical telluric spectrum to our rapidly rotating a star for each night we procured observations of a stars . from this measurement",
    ", we estimate the wavelength solution and the instrumental profile .",
    "the instrumental profile is solved for by interpolating the input spectrum onto a log - linear wavelength grid and convolving it with a gaussian kernel set to the spectral resolution of the instrument determined by fitting the telluric spectrum .",
    "we tested both single and multiple gaussian functions to obtain the instrumental profile of cshell .",
    "we favor multiple gaussians to fit the instrumental profile , as we had better agreement between the rv estimates from the ab nod pairs and smaller rv dispersions overall .",
    "the gaussian kernel is composed of one central gaussian and four satellite gaussians on each side following closely the technique described in @xcite .",
    "we set the positions of the centers of the gaussians and the widths of the satellite gaussians so that the curves barely overlap .",
    "the amplitude of the central gaussian is constrained by the normalization factor , while the width of the central gaussian is allowed to vary .",
    "the amplitudes of the satellite gaussians are allowed to vary .",
    "optimization of these values is accomplished by minimizing the variance weighted reduced chi - squared as described in @xcite to best reproduce the observed spectrum . in the cases",
    "when no a stars were observed on a night , we use the mean values determined on nights close to the night when a stars were observed .    after fitting the telluric spectrum ,",
    "the nine parameters used to characterize the lsf are kept constant for all remaining fits .",
    "we use an iterative process where we fit the target spectrum to the combined synthetic stellar model and empirical telluric model . on the first iteration",
    ", we fit the wavelength solution , the depth of the telluric spectrum , the rv , the normalization constant , and the linear normalization term . with an improved guess on our second iteration",
    ", we allow the @xmath20sin@xmath15 , the depth of the telluric model , the depth of spectral model and the two normalization constants to fluctuate .",
    "the @xmath20sin@xmath15 is determined following the description provided in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the average @xmath20sin@xmath15 value from this iteration for all epochs as the @xmath20sin@xmath15 value for the star . finally , we repeat the first iterative process allowing the wavelength solution , the depth of the telluric spectrum , the rv , the normalization constant , and the linear normalization term to vary in order to determine the absolute rv of the star .",
    "computationally , the optimization of the model spectrum is completed using amoeba , which is a routine used for minimization of multiple variables using the downhill simplex method of @xcite .",
