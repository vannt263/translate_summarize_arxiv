    "the main properties of the ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are their extremely high luminosities ( @xmath4 ) , diversity of x - ray spectra , strong variability , their connection with star - forming regions and surrounding nebulae . here",
    "we continue to develop the idea that the galactic supercritical accretor ss433 intrinsically is very bright x - ray source and it is a prototype of ulxs in external galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that ulxs are supercritical accretion disks in close binaries with stellar mass black holes or microquasars .",
    "we discuss possible properties of the funnel in the supercritical accretion disk of ss433 to predict x - ray spectral features and temporal behaviour of the funnel in `` face - on ss433 '' stars in application to ulxs .",
    "the main difference between ss433 and other known x - ray binaries is highly supercritical and persistent mass accretion rate ( @xmath5 ) onto the relativistic star , a probable black hole ( @xmath6 ) , which has led to the formation of a supercritical accretion disk and the relativistic jets .",
    "ss433 properties were reviewed recently by @xcite .",
    "a total observed luminosity of ss433 is @xmath7 .",
    "practically all the energy is realised near the black hole .",
    "a temperature of the source is @xmath8 , when the accretion disk is the most open to the observer and it is @xmath9 , when it is observed edge - on ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the source sed is represented by a single black - body source , its size is @xmath10 .",
    "the line of sight wind velocity varies from @xmath11 ( the most open disk ) to @xmath12 ( the disk is observed edge on ) .",
    "one may adopt the value @xmath13 for the wind velocity closer to the jets .",
    "the mass loss rate in the wind is @xmath14 .",
    "the optical jets ( @xmath15 ) consist of dense small gas clouds , the x - ray jets ( @xmath10 ) consist of hot ( @xmath16 ) cooling plasma .",
    "both the optical and x - ray jets are well collimated ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "ss433 x - ray luminosity ( the cooling x - ray jets ) is @xmath18 times less than bolometric luminosity , however kinetic luminosity of the jets is very high , @xmath19 , the jet mass loss rate is @xmath20y    the jets have to be formed in a funnel in the disk or the disk wind .",
    "supercritical accretion disks simulations ( @xcite ) show that a wide funnel ( @xmath21 ) is formed close to the black hole .",
    "convection is important in the inner accretion disk .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations of super - eddington radiation pressure - dominated disks with photon trapping ( @xcite ) have confirmed the importance of advective flows in the most inner parts of the disks . the mass accretion rate into the black hole a few times exceeds the mass loss rate in the disk wind .",
    "one may adopt a rough estimate of the accretion rate in the case of ss433 ( or the same for the gas supply rate in the accretion disk ) , @xmath22 .",
    "a critical luminosity for a @xmath23 black hole is @xmath24 and corresponding mass accretion rate @xmath25 .",
    "there are three factors ( @xcite ) increasing observed face - on luminosity of a supercritical accretion disk .",
    "( 1 ) inside the spherization radius the disk is locally eddington ( @xcite ) , which gives logarithmic factor @xmath26 ; ( 2 ) the doppler boosting factor is ( @xmath27 in ss433 ) is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is spectral index ; and ( 3 ) the geometrical funneling ( @xmath30 ) is @xmath31 .",
    "thus , one may expect an observed face - on luminosity of such supercritical disk @xmath32 . on the other hand , if one adopts for the funnel luminosity , that it is about the same as ss433 bolometric luminosity ( @xcite ) one obtains with the same opening angle of the funnel , the `` observed '' face - on luminosity of ss433 is @xmath33 and the expected frequency of such objects is @xmath34 per a galaxy like milky way .",
    "the disk spherization radius ( @xcite ) in ss433 is estimated @xmath35 , where the thomson opacity for a gas with solar abundance is @xmath36@xmath37/g .",
    "corresponding wind velosity is @xmath38 , where we adopted the black hole mass @xmath39 .",
    "the size of the hot wind photosphere and the photosphere temperature ( for not a face - on observer ) are estimated @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "both the size of the hot body and the temperature are quite close to those we observe in ss433 .",
    "we find the jet photosphere size @xmath42 , this value indicates the bottom of the funnel , below @xmath43 the funnel walls can not be observed .",
    "a temperature of the inner funnel walls at a level of @xmath43 is estimated as ( @xcite ) @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "such temperatures provide a high ionisation of elements needed for the line - locking mechanism ( @xcite ) to operate for the jet acceleration .",
    "we conclude that the uv radiation of the ss433 disk ( @xmath47 ) is roughly isotropic , but its x - ray funnel radiation ( @xmath48 ) is mildly anisotropic .",
    "the same conclusions have to be done for face - on ss433 stars ( ulxs ) , they are expected to be very bright uv sources and their x - ray luminosities have to be even higher , up to @xmath49 , due to the additional geometrical collimation .",
    "temporal variability of the ss433 funnel is expected on time scales @xmath50 and @xmath51 . a typical accretion disk variability power density spectrum at scales @xmath52 is expected .",
    "however the most rapid variability may be observed only for face - on ss433 stars , in the case of ss433 ( the edge - on system ) , all the short - scale variability of the funnel ( @xmath53 ) has to be smoothed down in the funnel .",
    "some of the expected x - ray variability patterns have been observed recently ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the multicolor funnel ( mcf ) model has been developed ( @xcite ) to estimate the emerging x - ray spectrum in the funnel .",
    "the main parameters of the models are ( i ) the initial radius , the deepest visible level in the inner funnel walls ( @xmath54 ) , ( ii ) the walls temperature at @xmath55 , ( iii ) the ratio of radiation to gas pressure @xmath56 at @xmath57 , ( iv ) the wind velocity @xmath58 and ( v ) the funnel opening angle @xmath59 .",
    "photon trapping in the wind is considered by a simple comparison of advection time ( @xmath60 ) and diffusion time ( @xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 is a terminal wind velocity .",
    "these times are equal at the radius @xmath63 .",
    "there is a local advective radiation transfer at @xmath64 and global diffusion transfer at @xmath65 .",
    "in fig.1 we present simulated mcf spectra as seen with xmm mos1 with total counts @xmath66 , obtained with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and 10 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and their fittings using the _ diskbb _ model .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the mcf spectrum is broader than that of the mcd ( diskbb ) .",
    "shallow , very broad ( 0.1 - 0.3c ) and blue - shifted absorption lines are expected in the funnel x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption bands should belong to h- and he - like ions of the most abundant ( o , ne , mg , si , s , fe ) elements and should extend from the kc to the k@xmath29 energies of the corresponding ions .",
    "fig.2 shows possible fake broad emission / absorption features which could be observed in ulxs spectral residuals .",
    "we have simulated a power law spectrum with introduced lc edges of cvi , nvii and oviii blueshifted to the ss433 jet velocity @xmath72 .",
    "the optical thickness of these introduced edges corresponds to `` effective '' hydrogen thickness @xmath73 .",
    "spectral residuals in the figure were derived from the xmm mos1 power law spectral model to the simulated spectrum .",
    "the fake emission / absorption features appear both due to the blueshifts of the edges and the energetic differences between neutral and highly ionised absorptions .",
    "residuals of such type are observed in ulxs spectra ( for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption edges , if they are confirmed in ulxs spectra give a possibility to measure the jet velocities in supercritical disk funnels ."
