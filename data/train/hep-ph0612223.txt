    "the investigation and comparison of the physics potential of future neutrino oscillation facilities has by now become an industry .",
    "extensive studies of sensitivities of future experiments to neutrino parameters are performed , see for example  @xcite . a widely used procedure for such calculations  in the following referred to as _ standard procedure_is to assume some input values ( `` true values '' ) for the oscillation parameters for which the predictions for the observables in a given experiment are calculated without statistical fluctuations . then these predictions are used as `` data '' and a statistical analysis of these data is performed to see how well the input values for the parameters can be reconstructed by the experiment .",
    "this procedure should give the sensitivity of an `` average '' experiment , where `` average '' lacks a precise definition .",
    "in this letter i will clarify the correct interpretation of such sensitivities .",
    "focusing on the sensitivity to a non - zero value of the lepton mixing angle @xmath0 the potential of a future experiment will be quantified by answering the following question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given a true value of @xmath0 , what is the probability that the hypothesis @xmath2 can be excluded at a certain confidence level ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this generalises the usual sensitivity limits to a well defined statistical statement and will allow also a precise definition of the term `` average experiment '' .",
    "for example one may define the sensitivity of an average experiment as the value of @xmath3 for which @xmath4 can be excluded with a probability of 50% .    as realistic examples",
    "i will consider the t2k  @xcite and double - chooz  @xcite ( d - chooz ) experiments .",
    "details of the simulation and assumptions on the experimental configurations are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : exps ] . from the statistical point of view",
    "there is an important difference between the two settings . in t2k one",
    "looks for the appearance of @xmath5 events from the @xmath6 oscillation channel on top of the intrinsic @xmath5 background in the beam .",
    "therefore it is similar to the problem of a poisson signal over a background .",
    "in contrast , d - chooz is a disappearance experiment at a nuclear reactor comparing the @xmath7 signal in a near and far detector where in both detectors a very large number of events is obtained , and one looks for a small difference in these large numbers beyond the geometrical scaling with the distance . hence one may expect that in this case gaussian approximations are well justified .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : th13 ] the sensitivity of t2k and d - chooz to @xmath8 is considered by performing a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the experiments .",
    "a large number of artificial data sets is generated to calculate the actual distribution of the statistics used to decide whether @xmath4 should be rejected at a given confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "this will allow to answer the question stated above within a well defined frequentist framework .",
    "moreover one does not rely on questionable assumptions necessary in the standard procedure , for example issues related to the non - linear character of the parameters , the periodicity of the cp phase @xmath9 , the physical boundary @xmath10 , assuming standard @xmath11-distributions , and the question of how many degrees of freedom to use for them .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : cp ] i extend these methods to the case of cp violation searches , where the example of the t2hk experiment is considered .",
    "this case is especially interesting from the statistical point of view , since the quantity of interest `` cp violation '' has rather non - standard statistical properties since it is directly related to the periodic variable @xmath9 , and the assumption of a linear parameter dependence of the observables which is implied by the use of standard @xmath11-distributions is not justified a priori .",
    "for the simulation of the d - chooz reactor experiment the information available in the proposal ref .",
    "@xcite is used . for the far detector at distances of 998  m and 1115  m from the two reactor cores",
    "an exposure of 5 years with 60.5% efficiency is assumed .",
    "the near detector at an equal distance of 280  m from both cores will come online somewhat later and i take 3 years of data with 43.7% efficiency .",
    "this gives in total @xmath12 events in the far and @xmath13 events in the near detector  @xcite .",
    "i take into account an uncertainty on the reactor neutrino flux of 2% ( uncorrelated between the two cores ) and assume an error in the relative normalisation of the two detectors of 0.6% .",
    "furthermore i include a background of 3.6% ( 2.7% ) in the far ( near ) detector which is known within an uncertainty of 20% .",
    "a fit is performed for the two oscillation parameters @xmath8 and @xmath14 , where always the true value @xmath15  ev@xmath16 is adopted and external information on @xmath14 with an accuracy of 5% at 1@xmath17 is assumed .",
    "more details of the reactor simulation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and the standard limits are in good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the generation of artificial data for the d - chooz experiment",
    "i assume that the systematical uncertainties are random variables , i.e. , for the flux normalisations from the two reactor cores and for the normalisations of the two detectors gaussian variables are thrown with the errors given above .",
    "then the expected event number in each bin of each detector is shifted accordingly , and this shifted value is used as mean for generating the `` observed '' event number in this bin according to a poisson distribution .    for the simulation of the t2k and t2hk experiments",
    "i follow closely the setup provided within the globes software package  @xcite which is based on information from ref .",
    "however , in order to be able to perform the mc simulation for the analysis presented here a dedicated code has been developed which drastically reduces the required calculation time . to this aim the following simplifications have been adopted .",
    "the oscillation parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath14 are fixed to their assumed true values @xmath20 , @xmath21  ev@xmath16 , and @xmath22  ev@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "i analyse only the appearance channel , the disappearance channel is taken into account implicitly by fixing @xmath14 and assuming an external uncertainty on @xmath23 of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) at @xmath26 for t2k ( t2hk ) . the true value of @xmath23 is assumed to be @xmath27 , which implies that the octant degeneracy is absent .",
    "i do not take into account the sgn(@xmath14 ) degeneracy and assume always normal neutrino mass hierarchy .    for the t2k simulation",
    "i assume 5 years of data taking in the neutrino channel , a 0.76  mw beam , and the 22.5  kt fiducial mass of the sk detector .",
    "signal and background events are normalised to the standard globes setup  @xcite and systematical errors of 5% are assumed on signal and background . despite the simplifications mentioned above standard sensitivity limits of this t2k simulation are in excellent agreement with the ones calculated with globes .",
    "the t2hk implementation follows the setup adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which consists of a 4  mw beam , the hk detector with 440  kt mass , 2 years of neutrino and 8 years of anti - neutrino data .",
    "uncorrelated systematical errors of 5% are included for the signal and background in neutrino and anti - neutrino running . in the case of t2hk minor differences of standard sensitivity limits",
    "appear between the simulation used here and the globes implementation due to the adopted simplifications and other subtle differences in the analysis .",
    "artificial data sets for t2k and t2hk are generated in the following way .",
    "assuming true values of @xmath0 and @xmath9 the predicted spectrum in reconstructed neutrino energy is calculated using a gaussian energy resolution of 85  mev due to fermi motion for quasi - elastic ( qe ) events and no energy information for non - qe events ( i.e. , energy smearing with uniform distribution ) .",
    "the qe and non - qe event spectra are added taking into account the relevant ratio of cross sections .",
    "systematical uncertainties are considered as random variables , i.e. , for each systematic a gaussian variable is thrown with an error of 5% and the signal and background spectra are rescaled accordingly . then the `` observed '' number of events in each bin is generated from a poisson distribution with the mean corresponding to",
    "the systematic - shifted predicted event numbers .",
    "in this section i am going to answer the question quoted in the introduction considering the t2k and d - chooz experiments .",
