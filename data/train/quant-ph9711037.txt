    "complex - energy `` eigenfunctions '' made their dbut in quantum mechanics through the hands of gamow , in the theory of alpha - decay @xcite .",
    "gamow imposed an `` outgoing wave boundary condition '' on the solutions of the schrdinger equation for an alpha - particle trapped in the nucleus .",
    "since there is only an _ outgoing _ flux of alpha - particles , the wavefunction @xmath0 must behave far from the nucleus as ( for simplicity , we consider an s - wave , and use units such that @xmath1 ) @xmath2 this boundary condition , together with the requirement of finiteness of the wave function at the origin , gives rise to a quantization condition on the values of @xmath3 ( and , therefore , on the values of @xmath4 ) .",
    "it turns out that such values are complex : @xmath5 and so it follows that @xmath6 thus , if @xmath7 , the probability of finding the alpha - particle in the nucleus decays exponentially in time .",
    "the lifetime of the nucleus is then given by @xmath8 , and the energy of the emitted alpha - particle by @xmath9 .",
    "although very natural , this interpretation suffers from some difficulties .",
    "how can the energy , which is an observable quantity , be complex ?",
    "( in other words , how can the hamiltonian , which is a hermitean operator , have complex eigenvalues ? ) also , these `` eigenfunctions '' are not normalizable , since @xmath10 positive implies @xmath11 positive and so , according to ( [ |psi| ] ) , @xmath12 diverges exponentially with @xmath13 .    in spite of such problems ( which , in fact , are closely related ) , it is a fact of life that alpha - decay , as well as other types of decay , does obey an exponential decay law and , in many cases , gamow s method provides a very good estimate for the decay rate .",
    "why this method works is a question that has been addressed in the literature using a variety of techniques @xcite .",
    "here we examine this question in a very elementary way , using techniques that can be found in any standard quantum mechanics textbook and some rudiments of complex analysis .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ ii ] , we show gamow s method in action for a very simple potential . some of the results obtained there are used in section [ iii ] , where we study the time evolution of a wave packet initially confined in the potential well defined in section [ ii ] .",
    "this is done with the help of the propagator , built with the _ true _ eigenfunctions ( i.e. , associated to _",
    "real _ eigenenergies ) of the hamiltonian . as a bonus ,",
    "we show that the exponential decay law is not valid either for very small or for very large times .",
    "this is the content of section [ iv ] , where the region of validity of the exponential decay law is roughly delimited .",
    "in order to exhibit gamow s method in action , we shall study the escape of a particle from the potential well given by : @xmath14 ( escape from this potential well was studied in detail in refs.@xcite . in this section",
    "we follow closely the treatment of ref.@xcite . )",
    "the positive dimensionless constant @xmath15 is a measure of the `` opacity '' of the barrier at @xmath16 ; in the limit @xmath17 , the barrier becomes impenetrable , and the energy levels inside the well are quantized . if @xmath15 is finite , but large , a particle is not confined to the well anymore , but it usually stays there for a long time before it escapes . if @xmath15 is small , the particle can easily tunnel through the barrier , and quickly escape from the potential well .",
    "metastability , therefore , can only be achieved if the barrier is very opaque , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "since this is the most interesting situation , we shall assume this to be the case in what follows .    to find out how fast the particle escapes from the potential well",

    "( [ quant ] ) ! is this a coincidence ?",
    "in fact , no . according to ( [ ab ] ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 have the same poles ; therefore , near a pole both @xmath68 and @xmath71 are very large , and eqs .",

    "let us put aside , for a moment , the integral in ( [ psi3 ] ) ( it will be discussed in the next section ) .",
    "then , the `` nonescape '' probability ( i.e. , the probability of finding the particle inside the well ) is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath18 , the interference terms are usually negligible , for @xmath94 and , therefore , the functions @xmath95 are approximately orthogonal . on the other hand ,",
    "since the decay rate @xmath10 of the @xmath54-th decaying mode is a rapidly increasing function of @xmath54 ( @xmath96 ) , the decay becomes almost a pure exponential one when @xmath97 .",
    "the system , therefore , `` loses memory '' of the initial state .    finally , let us note that no exponential catastrophe occurs with @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , one can easily show , using ( [ psi1 ] ) , ( [ g ] ) , ( [ completeness ] ) and the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions @xmath77 , that @xmath99 so that an exponential growth of @xmath100 is completely ruled out .",
    "in order to derive expression ( [ p(t ) ] ) for the nonescape probability , we had to neglect the first term on the right hand side of ( [ psi3 ] ) . in this section we show that such approximation is not valid either for very small or for very large times . that it can not be valid for very small @xmath53 follows from the fact that initially the decay is slower than exponential @xcite .",
    "this can be easily proved with the help of the continuity equation @xcite : @xmath101_{x = a}.\\ ] ] since , by hypothesis , @xmath102 , it follows that @xmath103 when @xmath52 , whereas for the expression ( [ p(t ) ] ) one has @xmath104 at @xmath52 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the exponential decay does not last forever .",
    "after a sufficiently long time , it obeys a power law @xcite . to see this , note that the integral in ( [ psi3 ] ) , which we shall denote here by @xmath105 , is dominated by small values of @xmath3 when @xmath106 , and so can it be approximated by @xmath107 therefore , the nonescape probability behaves asymptotically as decays as @xmath108 when @xmath106 , in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ pas ] ) .",
    "however , there is a flaw in their argument ; when properly corrected @xcite , it also leads to @xmath109 asymptotically . ]",
    "@xmath110 comparing ( [ pas ] ) with ( [ p(t ) ] ) , and using ( [ tau ] ) , one finds that they become comparable in magnitude when @xmath111 or , since @xmath18 , when @xmath112 in practice , when the decay begins to obey a power law the nonescape probability is so small @xmath113 that it should be very difficult to observe deviations from exponential decay .",
    "( on the other hand , experimental evidence for non - exponential decay at _ small _ times has been reported recently @xcite . )    in closing this section , we would like to remark that the breakdown of the exponential decay law for either small or large times is not a peculiar feature of the potential ( [ v ] ) .",
    "it is possible to show that an exponential decay can not last forever if the hamiltonian is bounded below @xcite , and can not occur for very small times if , besides that , the energy expectation value of the initial state is finite @xcite  conditions which certainly must be satisfied by any realistic hamiltonian or state .",
    "in this paper we showed that decaying states , although plagued by the exponential catastrophe , give a fairly good description of the decay of a metastable state , provided some conditions are satisfied . in fact , the main objective of this paper was to show that one _ can _ compute the decay rate solving the time independent schrdinger equation subject to the `` outgoing wave boundary condition . ''",
    "this is far from being a trivial result , since the corresponding eigenstates are unphysical .",
    "the effectiveness of the decaying states in describing the decay may be understood by noticing @xcite that they are good approximate solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation , although nonuniform ones ( i.e. , they are not valid in the entire range of values of @xmath53 and @xmath114 ) .",
