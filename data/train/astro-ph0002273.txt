    "hydrocarbons in jupiter are produced in a series of chemical pathways initiated by the photolysis of methane in the upper stratosphere .",
    "vertical transport , mainly turbulent diffusion , redistributes the molecules throughout the stratosphere and down to the troposphere , where they are eventually destroyed . hydrocarbons , and particularly the most stable of them , are therefore good tracers of the upper atmospheric dynamics . in addition , as they strongly contribute to the atmospheric opacity in the uv and ir , hydrocarbons act as major sources and sinks of heat , thereby participating to the stratospheric dynamics .",
    "all these reasons have strongly motivated theoretical studies of the jovian stratospheric photochemistry ( strobel @xcite ; yung & strobel @xcite ; and most recently gladstone et al .",
    "although nowadays very detailed , these models still need to be constrained by observations of minor species .",
    "however , prior to the iso mission , only two molecules , acetylene ( @xmath11 ) and ethane ( @xmath12 ) , had been detected , except in the auroral zones where several other minor species ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) have been observed ( kim et al .",
    "mean stratospheric mole fractions have been inferred for @xmath11 and @xmath12 by various authors , but no precise information on their vertical variations was made available .",
    "in this paper , we analyse the iso - sws spectrum of jupiter between 7 and 17 @xmath0 , in order to determine the vertical distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and to search for more complex ( c@xmath16 and c@xmath17 ) molecules .",
    "2 presents the observations .",
    "our analysis of the spectrum is presented in sect .",
    "the results are compared with previous observations and theoretical predictions in sect .",
    "descriptions of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and of the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) can be found respectively in kessler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and de graauw et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the jupiter sws spectrum can be found in encrenaz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "new iso - sws grating observations of jupiter were obtained on may 23 , 1997 ut using the aot 01 observing mode .",
    "these observations have an average spectral resolution of 1500 , and range from 2.4 to 45 @xmath0 .",
    "however , the useful range is limited to 2.417 @xmath0 , due to partial saturation at longer wavelengths .",
    "the instrument aperture , @xmath18 arcsec@xmath19 at @xmath20 @xmath0 and @xmath21 arcsec@xmath19 at @xmath22 @xmath0 , was centered on the planet with the long axis aligned perpendicular to the ecliptic , thus roughly parallel to the n - s polar axis .",
    "it covered latitudes between 30@xmath23s and 30@xmath23n , and @xmath24 longitude range from the central meridian .",
    "the absolute flux accuracy is @xmath25 .",
    "instrumental fringing generates a spurious signal between 12.5 and 17 @xmath0 , which amounts to @xmath2610% of the continuum level .",
    "this parasitic signal was for the most part removed by fitting the detector relative response function to the observed spectrum and then dividing it out .",
    "residual fringes were further removed by selective frequency filtering .",
    "we analysed the iso - sws spectrum using a standard line - by - line radiative transfer code adapted to jupiter s conditions .",
    "we included the molecular absorptions by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath29 using the spectroscopic parameters of the geisa97 databank ( jacquinet - husson et al .",
    "we also considered @xmath30 absorption , using a linelist provided by e.  ari ( private communication ) and band intensities from koops et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic parameters for the @xmath31 s(1 ) line were calculated using molecular constants from jennings et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and reuter & sirota ( @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath32-he collision - induced continuum was calculated following the work of borysow et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath27 vertical distribution was taken from fouchet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we first calculated synthetic spectra in the region of the @xmath28 @xmath33 band . for @xmath28",
    ", we used a deep mixing ratio of @xmath34 ( niemann et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the vertical profile derived by drossart et al .",
    "( @xcite ) from the @xmath28 fluorescence emission at 3.3 @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath33 band allows one to retrieve 4 independent points on the temperature profile between 35 and 1 mbar .",
    "we also generated synthetic spectra of the @xmath31 s(1 ) rotational line at 17 @xmath0 .",
    "this line probes a broad atmospheric layer at 330 mbar .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio of @xmath31 was assumed to follow local thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the stratospheric temperature profile was adjusted in order to best match the absolute emission in the @xmath28 band , and the line - to - continuum ratio of the @xmath31 s(1 ) line .    in practice , starting with the temperature profile measured in - situ by the galileo probe ( seiff et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it was necessary to cool it by 2 k between 30 and 5 mbar . at pressures lower than 5 mbar , the initial profile was warmed by 4 k up to @xmath35 k. the @xmath33 band is also somewhat sensitive to the temperature around the 10-@xmath36bar pressure level .",
    "we found that the temperature remains constant within a few degrees between 1 mbar and 1 @xmath36bar , as already observed by seiff et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . at pressures",
    "lower than 1 @xmath36bar , we adopted the measurements of seiff et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , vertically smoothed in order to remove oscillations due to gravity waves , noting that our measurements are essentially insensitive to this pressure range .",
    "the fit to the @xmath28 and @xmath31 emissions is presented in fig .",
    "[ figtemp ] .",
    "the 20% uncertainty on the absolute flux calibration directly results in an uncertainty of @xmath37k on the temperature profile inferred from the @xmath28 emission .",
    "this uncertainty partly explains the minor disagreement between the modelled and observed @xmath31 line .",
    "indeed , our model , while giving an optimum fit to the @xmath28 emission , slightly ( 510% ) overpredicts the observed line - to - continuum ratio of the s(1 ) line .",
    "we also note that the @xmath31 ortho - to - para ratio could differ from the thermal equilibrium value , as observed in the troposphere by conrath et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a synthetic spectrum calculated with a constant para fraction of 0.34 , corresponding to the thermal equilibrium value at 115 k , would fully reconcile the @xmath28 and @xmath31 measurements .",
    "the iso - sws observations in the vicinity of the @xmath11 emission at 13.7 @xmath0 were compared with synthetic spectra obtained with three distinct @xmath11 vertical distributions ( fig .  [ figpro ] ) .",
    "all three profiles reproduce the emissions due to the p-,q- , and r - branches of the main @xmath38 @xmath11 band ( fig .",
    "[ figace ] ) .",
    "however , only one profile ( fig .  [ figpro ] , solid line ) fits the observed spectrum in the q - branches of the @xmath39 band at 13.68 and 13.96 @xmath0 . indeed , while the @xmath38 band probes atmospheric levels between 2 and 5 mbar , the hot band sounds warmer , higher levels around 0.3 mbar , allowing us to determine the slope of the @xmath11 profile between these two regions .",
    "error bars on the @xmath11 mixing ratio were estimated by taking into account instrumental noise and the uncertainty in the relative strengths of the @xmath11 lines .",
    "the resulting mixing ratios are @xmath2 at 0.3 mbar and @xmath3 at 4 mbar , giving a slope @xmath4 .",
    "the error on the temperature profile ( @xmath37k ) introduces an additional uncertainty on the @xmath11 mixing ratios of about 20% .",
    "this error , however , essentially equally applies to all pressure levels , and thus leaves the retrieved @xmath11 profile slope mostly unaffected .",
    "similarly to @xmath11 , we compare in fig .",
    "[ figeth ] the iso - sws spectrum in the @xmath12 @xmath40 band with synthetic spectra calculated with three distinct @xmath12 vertical profiles ( fig .",
    "[ figpro ] ) .",
    "each of the profiles was designed to reproduce the observed emission in the @xmath41 multiplet at 12.16 @xmath0 , which probes the 1-mbar pressure level .",
    "the rest of the @xmath40 band consists of weaker multiplets , which sound deeper levels extending from 1 to 10 mbar .",
    "this combination of strong and weak multiplets makes this band sensitive to the @xmath12 vertical distribution .",
    "in addition , the pseudo - continuum level in between the @xmath12 emissions is also sensitive to the @xmath12 abundance in the lower stratosphere .    our best - fit model ( fig .",
    "[ figpro ] , solid line ) has a slope @xmath42 , but the steep - slope model ( fig .",
    "[ figpro ] , dotted line ) is also marginally compatible with the observations .",
    "this results in a relatively large uncertainty on the slope determination : @xmath5 at 1 mbar , and @xmath6 at 10 mbar , giving @xmath7 .",
    "an additional error of 25% on @xmath1 comes from the uncertainty on the temperature .",
    "again , it should not affect the retrieved slope .",
    "the iso - sws spectrum exhibits a broad emission near 15.8 @xmath0 , which coincides with the @xmath40 band of @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ figmet ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath29 lines are optically thin , no information on the vertical profile can be derived .",
    "using a vertical profile similar to that calculated by gladstone et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we found a column density of @xmath8 molecule@xmath9 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum exhibits small - scale structures which are not seen in the observations .",
    "this mismatch is propably due to an imperfect data reduction .",
    "indeed , the respective frequencies of the fringes and of the @xmath29 features lie close to each other .",
    "it is therefore very difficult to fully remove the former without altering the latter . on the contrary ,",
    "the broad emission is a low frequency signal and is therefore left unaffected by the frequency filtering .",
    "this explanation is admittedly not entirely satisfactory , but given the wavelength match of the emission with the @xmath40 mode of @xmath29 , and in the absence of any other plausible candidates , we regard the detection of methylacetylene as unambiguous .    the @xmath43 band of @xmath30 is not detected at 15.92 @xmath0 .",
    "we inferred an upper limit of the @xmath30 column density of @xmath10 molecule@xmath9 , using the gladstone et al .",
    "( @xcite ) profile .",
    "bzard et al .  ( @xcite )",
    "first showed from 13.4-@xmath0 high - resolution spectroscopy that the @xmath11 mixing ratio increases with height in the stratosphere , and that most of the acetylene is concentrated above the @xmath260.5-mbar level .",
    "their distribution has a mixing ratio of about @xmath44 at 0.3 mbar , in reasonable agreement with our results .",
    "more recently , btremieux & yelle ( @xcite ) , using uv observations , found an average @xmath11 mixing ratio in the 2060 mbar range of @xmath45 , consistent with our value of @xmath46 , extrapolated to this pressure range . using height - dependent mixing ratio profiles to analyse high - resolution infrared observations , sada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) derived mixing ratios of @xmath47 for @xmath12 at 5 mbar and @xmath48 for @xmath11 at 8 mbar . while the former value exactly agrees with our results , the latter is almost 3 times less than that extrapolated downwards from our @xmath11 profile . also from infrared observations ,",
    "noll et al .  ( @xcite ) , using a slope of @xmath49 , found a @xmath12 mixing ratio of @xmath50 at 1 mbar , which compares reasonably well with our measurement at the same pressure level .",
    "we also compared our retrieved mixing ratios with those calculated in the photochemical model of gladstone et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for @xmath12 ,",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with their model both at 1 and 10 mbar ( fig .",
    "[ figpro ] ) . for @xmath11 , while the agreement is good at 4 mbar , their mixing ratio at 0.3 mbar is higher than ours by a factor of 4 .",
    "our @xmath11 slope is then significantly lower than theirs ( @xmath4 vs.  @xmath51 ) .",
    "note that our derived @xmath11 slope is still steeper than that of @xmath12 ( @xmath7 ) , as expected .",
    "indeed , @xmath12 , being less subject to photolysis , has a longer lifetime in the jovian stratosphere than @xmath11 ( gladstone et al .",
    "@xcite , their fig .  6 ) .",
    "hydrocarbons are formed from the photolysis of @xmath28 around the homopause .",
    "small - scale turbulence , parameterized in a photochemical model by the eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath52 ) , transports them downwards in the stratosphere .",
    "this process is approximately modelled for long - lived products by the equation @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number density at altitude @xmath55 and @xmath56 the vertically integrated net production rate above altitude @xmath55 .",
    "a first hypothesis would attribute the difference between the observed and calculated @xmath11 abundances to an overestimation of the @xmath11 production rate @xmath56 in the gladstone et al .  model .",
    "our two abundance measurements at 4 and 0.3 mbar allow us to calculate the mean @xmath57 over this pressure range . comparing with the value of @xmath57 predicted by gladstone et al .  at 1 mbar",
    ", we found that @xmath56 should be decreased by a factor of @xmath263 .",
    "a second explanation would be that gladstone et al .  underestimated the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath52 by a factor of @xmath263 around 1 mbar .",
    "this underestimation at 1 mbar should also apply to the level and eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath58 ) at the homopause .",
    "however , it is difficult to directly quantify the changes on the homopause parameters , because of the strong coupling between production rates and homopause level .",
    "simply , we note that our analysis could imply an increase in @xmath58 .",
    "it is consistent with drossart et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who , analysing @xmath28 fluorescence , found @xmath59 @xmath60 , higher than the value of 1.4@xmath61 assumed in the gladstone et al .  model . in this case , the agreement on the @xmath12 slope would also imply that the @xmath12 production rate has been underestimated by gladstone et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the most direct conclusion of our measurements is that gladstone et al .  have overestimated the @xmath11/@xmath12 production rate ratio .",
    "the iso - sws spectrum enables the first detection of @xmath29 in the equatorial region of jupiter .",
    "we retrieved a column density of @xmath8 molecule@xmath9 .",
    "kim et al .  ( @xcite )",
    "had previously detected @xmath29 in the north polar auroral zone of jupiter , and had retrieved a column density of @xmath62 molecule@xmath9 . at least a large part of the difference is explained by different modelling assumptions .",
    "kim et al .",
    "( @xcite ) assumed a uniform vertical distribution throughout the stratosphere and used a temperature profile for the auroral region which is now known to be incorrect ( drossart et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath30",
    ", we found only an upper limit of @xmath10 molecule@xmath9 , 65 times lower than the stratospheric column density predicted by gladstone et al .",
    "( 4.5@xmath6310@xmath64 molecule@xmath9 ) .",
    "this is consistent with their overestimate of @xmath11 production , since the production of @xmath30 is essentially quadratically dependent on the abundance of @xmath11 . as our @xmath29 column density is 3.5 times larger than calculated by gladstone et al . , we derived a @xmath29/@xmath30 ratio larger than 20 , while they found a ratio of @xmath65 .",
    "this discrepancy is all the more remarkable as , in the case of saturn , where both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are detected ( de graauw et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the photochemical model of moses et al .",
    "( @xcite ) gives , as observed , a @xmath29/@xmath30 ratio of about 10 .",
