    "techniques based on adiabatic passage provide very practical methods for producing nearly complete transfer of population between two quantum states using crafted laser pulses @xcite . one popular example of such coherent adiabatic excitation , stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , provides a simple and robust technique for transferring population between two nondegenerate metastable levels , making use of two pulses , termed the pump pulse ( linking the initially populated ground state @xmath3 with excited state @xmath4 ) and the stokes pulse ( linking excited state @xmath4 with final state @xmath5 of the three - state chain ) .",
    "when the pulses are properly timed ( stokes preceding but overlapping the pump pulse ) and two - photon resonance is maintained , then via adiabatic passage the population is transferred from initial to final state , without appreciable population in the excited state at any time .",
    "the operation of stirap can be understood by introducing instantaneous eigenstates of the time - varying hamiltonian , the time - dependent adiabatic states with associated time - dependent eigenvalues ( adiabatic energies ) .",
    "one ( and only one ) of these states , @xmath6 , is constructed from only the initial and final state , with no component of the excited state . because the excited state generates fluorescence via spontaneous emission",
    ", such an adiabatic state will exhibit no such signal ; it is termed a _ dark _ state . during the stirap process",
    "the state vector @xmath7 remains aligned with the adiabatic state @xmath6 , while this state , in turn , changes composition from being aligned with @xmath3 initially to being aligned with @xmath5 after the stokes - pump pulse sequence .",
    "numerous extensions of the basic three - state stirap @xcite have been considered @xcite , including examples in which there occur magnetic sublevels and associated degeneracy .",
    "one possibility is that the atomic energy levels are coupled in such a way that each one is connected to at most two others .",
    "population transfer in such multi - state chains has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "in addition to straightforward population transfer , stirap has been applied to the problem of manipulating and creating coherent superpositions of two or more quantum states .",
    "such superpositions are required for many contemporary applications including information processing and communication .",
    "the original stirap process has , for example , been utilized to create coherent superpositions in three- and four - level systems @xcite and to prepare @xmath8-component maximally coherent superposition states @xcite .",
    "there have been proposals to create @xmath8-component coherent superpositions in such systems , where the final state space is degenerate @xcite , at least in the rotating wave picture .",
    "this idea has been further developed to map wave - packets between vibrational potential surfaces in molecules @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been shown for a specific degenerate system , having a single initial- , two degenerate intermediate- , and three degenerate final states coupled in the raman configuration , that the stirap process can be extended to systems with degenerate intermediate and final levels @xcite .    yet an open question has remained : what is the most general system of three degenerate levels , linked via raman process , for which it is possible to transfer all population from the ground - state manifold of degenerate states ( the @xmath0 set ) to the final - state manifold ( the @xmath2 set ) while minimizing population in the excited states ( the @xmath1 set ) , without first using optical pumping to prepare a single nondegenerate initial state ?",
    "we here provide the answer to this question .",
    "we consider @xmath9 degenerate states of the @xmath0 set , coupled by means of a pump - pulse to @xmath10 degenerate states of the @xmath1 set , which in turn are linked by the stokes pulse to @xmath11 degenerate states of the @xmath2 set .",
    "we will show that such a generalized stirap process is almost always possible if the succession of state - degeneracies is nondecreasing , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "when such conditions hold , then for arbitrary couplings among states ( e.g. arbitrary elliptical polarization of electric dipole radiation between magnetic sublevels ) it is possible to obtain complete adiabatic passage of all population from the states of the @xmath0 set into some combination of states of the @xmath2 set .",
    "we also examine the possibility of adiabatic passage when this restriction on degeneracies does not hold .",
    "we show that in this case in general only part of the population can be transferred to the @xmath2 set .",
    "we point out that , in special but important cases , for an appropriate choice of the polarizations and phases of the coupling fields , a complete adiabatic population transfer can be obtained .",
    "another motivation of this paper is the creation of coherent superposition states in a degenerate system .",
    "the difficulty in such systems arises from the limited possibility of addressing a single preselected state : addressing of a selected state is usually achieved by exploiting selection rules that the coupling field should satisfy .",
    "however , if we have e.g. two zeeman multiplets a light field with a certain polarization will create several couplings between the magnetic sublevels of the multiplets .",
    "our scheme offers a solution to this problem : we show that despite of the lack of selective addressing of the degenerate states , we have some control over the created coherent superposition state in the @xmath2 set . as we point out , and",
    "illustrate with specific examples , the level of control depends on the system under consideration .    our scheme is based on using a morris - shore ( ms ) transformation of the stokes couplings or the pump couplings , thereby reducing this particular ( generally complicated ) linkage to a set of unlinked two - state systems and dark states @xcite . underlying this technique is the fact that , as morris and shore @xcite have shown , any system of linkages in which there occur only two detunings ( i.e. the system has two sets of degenerate sublevels , termed here @xmath13 and @xmath14 , forming sets of dimension @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , can be transformed , via suitable redefinition of basis states , to one involving a set of @xmath17 independent two - state systems , where @xmath18 , together with a set of uncoupled states that are unconnected to other states by the given couplings ( one - state systems ) .",
    "if such an uncoupled state has no component from the @xmath1 set we term it a _ dark _ state .",
    "we here extend that work to produce sets of unlinked three - state systems .",

    "the zero matrix in the bottom right corner indicates that the system is supposed to maintain two - photon resonance .",
    "all time dependence occurs in the two pulse amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 , each with unit maximum value .",

    "similarly , the @xmath37 matrix @xmath38 consists of rabi frequencies associated with the transitions between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sets of states .",

    "( [ ham ] ) is similar to that of the conventional three - state stirap , in having all time dependence confined to two pulses @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but instead of single ground , excited , and final states we have degenerate manifolds of sublevels , and hence we have matrices @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 where conventional stirap would have scalar elements . to illustrate these fig .",
    "1 shows the linkage patterns for the angular momentum sequence @xmath45 . to simplify the drawings we show the energies of successive manifolds as increasing , such as would occur with a ladder scheme ; the connections are the same as with the usual lambda couplings , in which the final sublevels have energies below the excited state .",
    "although we discuss situations in which the coupling matrices result from magnetic - sublevel degeneracy , all of our results apply quite generally , for any mathematical form of the dipole - moment matrices and consequently for any arbitrary structure of the constant matrices @xmath46 and @xmath33 .",
    "there exist @xmath47 basis states for this system , and hence @xmath8 adiabatic states @xmath48 .",
    "we can immediately apply the ms transformation @xcite , at each instant of time , by placing the @xmath0 and @xmath2 sets of states together into the ms @xmath13 set , and taking the @xmath1 set to be the ms @xmath14 set .",
    "if the @xmath13 set is larger than the @xmath14 set , there will be @xmath49 uncoupled states .",
    "none of these have any component from the @xmath1 set , and so they are all dark states .",
    "the number of dark states is thus @xmath50 . in the conventional nondegenerate stirap @xcite ,",
    "for which @xmath51 , the ms transformation gives one dark state and one bright state ; for the tripod system , for which @xmath52 , there are two dark states @xcite . in the angular - momentum system of fig .",
    "[ fig:234-scheme ] there are @xmath53 dark states .    for conventional nondegenerate stirap the composition of the dark state changes with time , because the coupling matrices and the ms transformation change with time",
    ". however , it is possible to associate the ( single ) dark state initially with the nondegenerate ground state by applying the pulses in the counterintuitive order , i.e. stokes pulse preceding pump pulse . when there is degeneracy , it is necessary to establish that the entire population of any pure initial state in the @xmath0 set is projected into the set of dark states and no population is left in bright states .",
    "this completeness of the dark states is at the heart of our question concerning the possibility of stirap with degeneracy .",
    "one of our basic questions is whether , for a given linkage pattern , it is possible to empty completely the @xmath0 set for any arbitrary initial state , once we have fixed the pump and stokes pulses .",
    "it is easy to see that one necessary condition for complete removal of population from the ground manifold is that there should not be more sublevels in this manifold than there are in the excited state , i.e. we require @xmath54    to prove this assertion we employ a ms transformation @xcite on the pump transitions that connect ground and excited states .",
    "this transformation introduces a new set of basis states in each of these manifolds , such that each sublevel from the @xmath0 set couples to at most one sublevel from the @xmath1 set .",
    "were there are no stokes couplings between @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , the dynamics could be described as a set of independent two - state systems , together with some single states ( uncoupled states ) that are not affected by the pump radiation .",
    "given such a revision of the basis states , it is easy to see that if there are more ground states than excited states , @xmath55 , then the dark states will be composed of @xmath0-states and some population will be trapped there .",
    "this will remain unaffected by the radiation ; population can not be removed from them using this particular linkage pattern .",
    "figure [ fig:212scheme ] illustrates this accounting procedure .",
    "the top frame ( a ) shows a general coupling scheme for the sequence @xmath56 . the ms transformation on the @xmath29 pump transition produces the description shown in the bottom frame ( b ) . in the @xmath0 set , with this transformed basis , there occur two sublevels that have no connection with any excited states .",
    "population can not be removed from these as long as the couplings are those shown in the top frame .",

    ", width=188 ]    the introduction of ms basis states in this way makes the @xmath29 linkage pattern quite simple , but by introducing a new basis the @xmath58 couplings become more complicated : generally there will be a connection between each transformed @xmath1 state and each ( untransformed ) @xmath2 state , as indicated in frame ( b ) .",
    "next we consider the @xmath58 coupling .",
    "we can repeat the previous argument for the @xmath29 coupling with the replacements @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we obtain , that the stokes field ms transformation yields @xmath61 independent two level systems for the @xmath58 transition , plus @xmath62 uncoupled states in the larger one out of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sets .",

    "we emphasize that in this case the success of the full transfer is independent of the initial state of the system : it can be any pure state or a mixed state as well .",
