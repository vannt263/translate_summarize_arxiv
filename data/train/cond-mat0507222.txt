    "for describing the evolution of thin film morphologies several physical processes have to be considered , among others the atom condensation and evaporation , the adatom surface diffusion , the nucleation and the island growth . during the last decades",
    "significant advances have been done in modeling , taking advantage of both analytical and numerical approaches , the inititial stage of film formation , namely the nucleation and  the growth processes in the low coverage regime @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the methods range from the classical mean field rate equations to the scaling theories which are found to be suitable tools for describing both experimental and kinetic monte carlo results @xcite . in order to go beyond the early stage of the growth ,",
    "it is mandatory to tackle another physical process , that is the collision among the growing clusters . in the case of diffusionless clusters this process is actually linked to the cluster growth only . as a consequence an island which is in general",
    "a collection of connected clusters stems from one or more nucleation events .",
    "as regards the film morphology two mechanisms can be distinguished : the _ impingement _ and the _ coalescence_. in the former no redistribution of matter among clusters occurs after a collisional event and the clusters retain their individuality .",
    "conversely , in the latter mechanism redistribution of matter does occur with conservation of both mass and shape .",
    "the process of coalescence has been modeled , for the first time , by vincent @xcite who proposed an analytical solution for the island density kinetics on the basis of the poisson distribution .",
    "briscoe and galvin developed a statistical theory for island coalescence which is in good agreement with the behaviour of the island density decays obtained by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "as far as the impingement mechanism is concerned , it has been faced in a certain details in ref.coll serie ass .",
    "specifically , the exact solution for the normalized number density of islands , as a function of surface coverage @xmath3  where @xmath4 is the number density of islands at coverage @xmath5 and @xmath6  has been determined in the form of a series , the so called _ collision series_. this computation holds in the case of poissonian simultaneous nucleation and in the entire range of the surface coverage @xmath7 . by means of monte carlo simulations",
    "it was also shown that the first three terms well approximate the series @xcite .",
    "coalescence and impingement mechanisms of 2d and 3d islands have been extensively studied , through monte carlo simulations , as a function of the nucleus shape @xcite .",
    "this work clearly demonstrates that , independently of the collision mechanism governing the film formation , the @xmath8 kinetics is , in fact , the same , in spite of the fact that in the time domain the two mechanisms give rise to completely different kinetics . as a consequence , the behaviour of @xmath9 is expected to be the same also in the intermediate cases , namely the _ partial coalescence _ our prb coal+imp .",
    "the universal behaviour of the @xmath9 kinetics can be succesfully exploited for determining , from experimental data , the nucleation density at saturation . to this end",
    "it is sufficient to measure island densities in the high coverage regime @xmath10 , when islands are sufficiently large and atomic resolution microscopy is not required .",
    "an application of this approach to the growth of both diamond on si substrate and quaterthiophene films on silica substrate has been recently presented in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thanks to the universal behaviour of the normalized island density , @xmath11 also the non simultaneous nucleation case can be tackled . to this purpose one resorts to the classical mean field rate equations for both island and adatom densities .",
    "these equations can be integrated provided the rate coefficient for island collisions is evaluated @xcite . as a matter of fact this coefficient is a function of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the universal behavior of this function , together with the key role it plays in the rate equation approach to film growth , motivated further analytical studies .",
    "recently , on the ground of a mean field approximation a semi - analytical approach has been developed which leads to island density kinetics that is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation over the whole range of coverage .",
    "the method leads to @xcite ,    @xmath12 ^{2 } ,   \\label{an kin 1}\\ ] ]    where the function @xmath13 has to be evaluated numerically .",
    "the models discussed so far refer to the case in which nuclei are distributed at random throughout the whole surface .",
    "however , in nucleation processes ruled by adatom diffusion there exists a zone , around each nucleus , where the nucleation rate is reduced @xcite .",
    "in other words , the nucleation events do not occur at random on the entire surface and this brings about the establishment of a degree of spatial correlation among nuclei .",
    "one of the motivation of the present article is therefore the extension of the aforementioned analytical approach to the more realistic case of spatially correlated nuclei .",
    "like in the random distribution of nuclei , also in this case rate equations can be employed to deal with non simultaneous nucleation . in this instance",
    "it is worth noting that rate equations are suitable for describing kinetic monte carlo results of correlated nucleation @xcite .",
    "however , for want of theoretical modeling , in @xcite the @xmath9 function has been determined numerically through monte carlo simulations ( mc ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the first section",
    "we propose a novel analytical approach based on the statistical mechanics of rigid disks , for the evaluation of the @xmath9 kinetics in the random case .",
    "the rate coefficient for island collision is also computed , analytically . in the second section",
    "the method presented in @xcite will be employed to tackle the impingement process in simultaneous nucleation of spatially correlated nuclei .",
    "the following analytical approach for computing @xmath9 , is based on a mean field approximation , in the sense that at any given coverage ( time ) , all islands have the same shape and appropriate size ( disks in the case in point ) .",
    "this means that we are actually dealing with a sort of coalescence mechanism , yet , due to the universal behaviour of the @xmath9 function , the result of the computation can be applied to the impingement case as well .",
    "collisions involving more than two islands will be neglected .",
    "let us denote by @xmath14 the probability that an island be involved in a binary collision .",
    "since we are dealing with binary collision the changing rate of the island number is just equal to the rate of `` dimer '' formation ; this rate is equal to half the rate at which _ an island _ undergoes a collision event .",
    "therefore the relation holds    @xmath15    where @xmath16 stands for the number density of islands .",
    "a simple closure of eqn.[binaria 1 ] is achieved by setting @xmath17 @xmath18 being the radius of the islands , that is by considering the radial distribution function of the disks to be equal to one . for @xmath19 to a first approximation one receives @xmath20 or hutchinson @xmath21    as will soon be clear this is a poor description of @xmath9 over the entire range of coverage , it describes the kinetics in the low coverage regime only .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath22 the kinetics becomes @xmath23 as already derived in  @xcite .",
    "the reason of this inaccuracy relies in the fact that the radial distribution function of a system of impenetrable disks is not equal to one except in the limit of large particle separation .",
    "a more suitable choice of the probability for binary collision is indispensable in order to model the island density kinetics over the whole range of coverage . to this end",
    "the results achieved on the thermodynamic system of rigid spheres @xcite , @xcite , @xcite can be properly exploited .",
    "in particular we will make use of the results and the notation of ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath24 is the probability of finding a region of area @xmath25 centered at some arbitrary point empty of island centers ; @xmath26 is the probability that given an island ( its center ) at some arbitrary point , the region of area @xmath25 encompassing the central island is empty of island centers .",
    "the respective density probability functions are attained by the derivatives of the exclusion probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the expression of the exclusion probability @xmath29 for a system of particles not necessarely correlated through hard core potentials , has been derived in refs .",
    "@xcite , giurassico",
    ".    on the ground of the definition of the exclusion probability one gets @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average value of the island diameter .",
    "the rate equation for binary collision then becomes    @xmath32    in the thermodynamic limit , `` voids '' and `` islands '' exclusion probabilities are linked by the relationship @xcite    @xmath33    which holds for @xmath34 eqn.[torq 1 ] shows that for a system of hard disks @xmath35 furthermore in the same limit @xcite    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 } .$ ]    by using eqn.[binaria3 ] in the kinetic equation eqn.[binaria 2 ] , we eventually get    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the increment of surface fraction covered by islands , @xmath42 and @xmath43 the characteristic collision - time function .",
    "the definition of the time constant as given by eqn.[binaria 4 ] is in fact required in order to treat the non simultaneous nucleation by menas of rate equations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the integration of eqn.[binaria 4 ] can be performed analitically and gives ,    @xmath44    the validity of our approach has been tested by using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of island density decays in film growth ruled by the impingement mechanism @xcite . in fig.1 eqn.[islan kin1 ] ( for @xmath45 @xcite ) has been compared to the mc simulation .",
    "remarkably , the agreement between the simulation and the analytical result is excellent . in any case also the kinetics for @xmath46 @xcite  is in very good agreement with the simulation ( not shown ) .",
    "another analytical but less precise approach , is based on the exclusion probability already derived by us in ref.@xcite . by only retaining the heaviside contribution in the radial distribution function of hard disks and decoupling the multiple integral which gives the argument of the exponential of the @xmath24 function @xcite",

    "it is worth noting that this expression has been successfully employed for modeling the kinetics of the surface coverage in case of spatially correlated nucleation [ see the end of the article and @xcite ] . from eqn.[pr vuot our ] on account of eqn.[torq 1 ] we get @xmath51that , once inserted in eqn.[binaria 2 ] , yields the kinetics    @xmath52    as shown in fig.1 this kinetics is in a pretty good agreement with the mc simulation over the entire range of coverage @xcite . in the same figure it is also displayed the behavior of the solution eqn.[an g=1 ] . as appears , the modeling based on this last approximation is inadequate for describing the kinetics in the whole range of surface coverage ; in fact it is in agreement with the mc output only at very beginning of the kinetics .",
    "the kinetics of island density in the case of dirac delta ( or heterogeneous ) correlated nucleation can be determined by the same method as that employed in ref.@xcite .",
    "although the exclusion probability computed in ref.@xcite allows , in principle , to treat any kind of correlation , here it is introduced in such a way that nucleation in a circular region of radius @xmath53 around each nucleus is prevented .",
    "it goes without saying that during the growth the radius of the cluster can exceed @xmath54 let us introduce the extended surface , @xmath55 where @xmath18 stands for the nucleus radius and the quantity @xmath56 as a measure of the correlation degree of the system .",
    "the average value of the edge - to - edge distance among islands is given in terms of the exclusion probability as follows    @xmath57 d\\xi } { 1-\\theta ( r;\\theta ^{\\ast } ) } ,   \\label{edge - edge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where in the last equation the identity @xmath58 has been exploited and @xmath59 clearly @xmath60 .",

    "apparently ,    @xmath67    and , since for @xmath68 , @xmath69 from eqn.consvdistanza the @xmath66 constant is easily determined as @xmath70 .",
