    "the mapping @xmath20 naturally induces an orientation on @xmath15 and its boundary @xmath21 .",
    "the notation @xmath16 is justified by the fact that , up to ambient isotopy , @xmath16 depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "a change of orientation yields @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary @xmath24 is an oriented @xmath25-component link , sometimes referred to as the _ @xmath22-twisted double _ of @xmath0 .",
    "the above notions readily generalize to links @xmath26 in @xmath12 with @xmath27 components @xmath28 , by specifying corresponding homeomorphisms @xmath29 , with unknotted solid tori @xmath30 as preimages .",

    "in addition , we let the polynomial be equal to @xmath52 on the empty diagram .",

    "then @xmath86    kidwell proved an inequality relating properties of link diagrams to the maximum @xmath5-degree of a specialization of the ( at that time yet undiscovered ) kauffman polynomial  @xcite ; thistlethwaite later showed that essentially the same proof applies to the more general kauffman polynomial  @xcite :    [ thm : kidwell ] let @xmath0 be a link .",
    "for any link diagram @xmath38 of @xmath0 , let @xmath83 denote the number of crossings and @xmath87 denote the maximal bridge length , i.e. the longest sequence of consecutive crossing overpasses in @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , equality holds if @xmath38 is a reduced alternating and prime diagram .",
    "rudolph stated a curious theorem @xcite , which in part motivates the present study , relating the kauffman and rudolph polynomials with coefficients reduced modulo  @xmath25 .",
    "we start this investigation by taking a closer look at his congruence theorem :    let @xmath0 be any link .",
    "then @xmath89    we can reformulate the theorem in terms of the unoriented and the framed kauffman polynomial , rendering the congruence more natural .",
    "in particular , the congruence can also be used to relate the framed versions of these invariants .",
    "we also present versions involving a mbius transform of the kauffman polynomial , and the polynomial @xmath90 $ ] , which unveil a certain symmetry in rudolph s congruence .",
    "[ prop : congruence - transform ] the following are equivalent reformulations of the congruence theorem : @xmath91 & \\equiv_2 & ( { l}_{(k , f)}\\oplus \\pm 1)(v^{-2},z^2 )   \\\\ ~[k , f ] & \\equiv_2 & ( d_{(k , f)}\\oplus \\pm 1)(v^{-2},-z^2 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum in the second and the third congruence runs over all non - empty sublinks @xmath71 of @xmath0 .",
    "first , the signs in the @xmath92 terms in the congruences are immaterial since we work with coefficients reduced modulo  @xmath25 . for every framed link @xmath93",

    "1 ) ; finally the fourth congruence is obtained by the interchange formula ( see @xcite ) @xmath100 for switching between the kauffman and the dubrovnik polynomial .",

    "as we will see later , however , the current choice is rewarded by an eminently simple formula for the rudolph polynomial of composite links .",
    "we note on the fourth version of the congruence that yamada proved in  @xcite the remarkable one - variable _ equality _",

    "kidwell and stoimenow posed the following question relating the @xmath103-degree of the kauffman polynomial of a knot and the @xmath5-degree of its whitehead double  ( @xcite , see also  @xcite ) :    [ conj : kidwell ] let @xmath0 be a non - trivial knot , and let @xmath1 be a whitehead double of @xmath0 .",

    "we will study here a variant of this conjecture that also applies to links :    [ conj : extended ] let @xmath16 be a framed link .",
    "then @xmath107    we show that under an apparently weak additional condition on the knots under consideration , the statement of conjecture  [ conj : extended ] implies the statement of conjecture  [ conj : kidwell ] :    [ lem : bridge ] let @xmath16 be a framed knot for which @xmath108 , and + @xmath109 let @xmath110 be a whitehead double of @xmath0",

    "the above additional condition @xmath108 appears to be very weak , since to the author s knowledge no example of a nontrivial knot with  @xmath116 is known . as a warm - up , it is easy to see that conjecture  [ conj : extended ] in particular holds for all unlinks :    [ lem : unlink ] conjecture  [ conj : extended ] holds for all trivial links .",
    "assume @xmath22 is the framing induced by a diagram @xmath38 for the @xmath113-component trivial link @xmath117",
    ". then @xmath118 by elementary properties of the rudolph polynomial stated in @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath119 . for the kauffman polynomial , we similarly have @xmath120 , and so the maximal @xmath103-degree of @xmath121 equals  @xmath55 as well .",
    "we briefly review some previous results related to the above conjectures .",
    "the following generalizes an observation made by tripp in  @xcite :    [ prop : extended - ineq ] let @xmath0 be a nontrivial @xmath113-crossing prime alternating link . then for every framing @xmath22 , the inequality @xmath122 holds .",
    "let @xmath38 be a reduced alternating diagram of @xmath0 with @xmath113 crossings , and let @xmath123 be the diagram obtained by replacing each arc in @xmath38 by a corresponding pair of antiparallel arcs .",
    "we apply morton s inequality to @xmath123 : the number of crossings @xmath124 equals @xmath125 . for counting the number of seifert circles , we follow an idea given in  @xcite : regard @xmath38 as a @xmath126-regular planar graph with  @xmath113 vertices at the crossings , and , by euler s polyhedral formula , with @xmath127 faces .",
    "then the number of seifert circles @xmath128 arising from smoothing out the crossings equals @xmath129 : one for each face of the graph , and one for each four - crossing region in @xmath123 that corresponds to a single crossing in @xmath38 . since the maximum @xmath5-degree",

    "proposition  [ prop : extended - ineq ] , we obtain the following preliminary result :    conjectures  [ conj : kidwell ] and  [ conj : extended ] hold for all rational links .    in the following , we will generalize this result to a much larger class of links .",
    "in this section , we prove that the relation from conjecture  [ conj : extended ] is preserved under split union and composition , hence reducing the task to proving it for the case of prime links .",
    "the case of disjoint union is not hard to prove :    [ prop : split - links ] if conjecture  [ conj : extended ] holds for two framed links @xmath135 , @xmath136 , it also holds for the disjoint union @xmath137 .    for the kauffman polynomial",

    "thus , similar to the case of the skein polynomial  @xcite , we have    there exist infinitely many pairs of nonequivalent links with the same rudolph polynomial .",

    "the present research report studied the the behavior of the rudolph polynomial under basic operations on links .",
    "in particular , an unexpectedly natural formula for the rudolph polynomial of composite links was found .",
    "we proved that the conjectured relation is preserved under split union and link composition , and established its truth for a large class of alternating links .",
    "this class properly contains the algebraic alternating links , and for this class the mentioned additional assumption is true , namely that the @xmath103-degree of the kauffman polynomial is greater than zero .",
    "hence , the conjectures by kidwell and stoimenow and tripp turn out to hold for algebraic alternating knots .",
    "a weaker result heading into the same direction is found in a recent preprint by brittenham and jensen , establishing the conjecture for alternating pretzel knots  @xcite . that work , although appearing later than a preprint of the present paper , is apparently independent of the present work , since their proof is in part geometric , based on canonical seifert surfaces .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether these approaches admit a joint generalization , in particular for proving the conjecture for a larger family of non - alternating links .",
    "another interesting line of research concerns the relation of the framing variable  @xmath48 of the kauffman polynomial and the rudolph polynomial .",
    "some results in this direction are found already in  @xcite .",
    "many thanks to lee rudolph for pointing the author to reference  @xcite ; this enabled the author to establish substantially more general results than in a first draft of the present paper .",
    "thanks also to alexander stoimenow for some interesting discussion during the early stage of this work , and to an anonymous referee for some valuable corrections and suggestions .                                      .",
