    "the thermal expansion in solids is due to anharmonic vibrations , and in turn , anharmonic contributions to the elastic potential .",
    "this is a many - body potential , but pair potentials between neighboring atoms can play a significant role.@xcite in cusb@xmath17o@xmath6 the onset of local 1d magnetic order occurs on cooling below @xmath18115 k , as determined from the heat capacity @xmath68 .",
    "local order would strongly affect the pair potentials in those regions of the sample where the order occurs . this could lead to stretching or tilting of bonds as well as changes in bond strength in these regions .",
    "even if the affected pair potentials are harmonic , the result can be a potential for the _ sample _ that is anharmonic.@xcite thus , the increase in magnitude of the thermal expansion coefficients below @xmath18 115 k is most likely associated with changes in anharmonic contributions to the elastic potential of the sample as a result of the formation of short - range 1d antiferromagnetic order . below @xmath1850",
    "k the thermal expansion coefficients change behavior because a large proportion of the spins are ordered , and the anharmonic contributions reduce upon further cooling leading to a decrease in the magnitude of @xmath53 .",
    "the negative thermal expansion along @xmath23 is in strong contrast to the behavior along @xmath20 and @xmath12 , and is certainly connected to the 1d behavior between 8.7 k and 115 k and anharmonic lattice vibrations that specifically affect @xmath53 along this direction .",
    "other types of transitions can also lead to the development of anharmonic contributions to the thermal expansion , such as in li@xmath104mo@xmath1o@xmath105 where at 28 k a crossover in dimension has been associated with two - particle hopping and the formation of bosons.@xcite cugeo@xmath5 also exhibits@xcite a prominent correlation between thermal expansion and the formation of 1d magnetic correlations .",
    "the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of cusb@xmath0o@xmath1 were investigated .",
    "one - dimensional antiferromagnetic order among the spin @xmath14 cu atoms is observed to occur below @xmath18115 k. this order has a strong impact on anharmonic lattice vibrations , and leads to a sizable change in the thermal expansion coefficients . at @xmath3 = 8.7 k , a crossover from one- to three - dimensional antiferromagnetic behavior occurs .",
    "this long - range antiferromagnetic order leads to distinct jumps in the heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficients , which are reminiscent of those observed at the normal - superconducting phase transition .",
    "the heat capacity data reveals the presence of a gap below @xmath19 of magnitude @xmath106 = 17.48(6 ) k. the occurrence of three - dimensional antiferromagnetic order is attributed to a spin - peierls transition occurring as a result of three - dimensional phonons coupling with _ jordan - wigner - transformed _ fermions .",
    "spin - flop transitions for magnetic field applied in @xmath20 and @xmath12 axes below @xmath19 indicate that the easy afm axis lies in both the @xmath20 and @xmath12 directions , which may reflect the presence of significant magnetic disorder , or weak differences in the magnetocrystalline energy for these two directions",
