    "the object of study in the gibbs formulation of statistical mechanics is an ensemble of systems and the gibbs entropy is a functional of the ensemble probability density function .",
    "equilibrium is defined as the state where the probability density function is a time - independent solution of liouville s equation .",
    "the development of this approach has been very successful , but its extension to non - equilibrium presents contentious problems .    to implement the boltzmann approach @xcite the phase space is divided into a set of macrostates .",
    "the boltzmann entropy at a particular point in phase space is a measure of the volume of the macrostate in which the phase point is situated .",
    "the system is understood to be in equilibrium when the phase point is in a particular region of phase space .",
    "the entropy and equilibrium are thus properties of a single system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to attempt to produce a synthesis of the gibbs and boltzmann approaches , which validates the gibbs approach , as currently used in ` equilibrium ' statistical mechanics and solid state physics , while at the same time endorsing the boltzmann picture of the time - evolution of entropy , including ` the approach to equilibrium ' . in order to do this",
    "we need to resolve in some way three questions , to which the current versions of the gibbs and boltzmann approaches offer apparently irreconcilable answers : ( a ) what is meant by equilibrium ?",
    "( b ) what is statistical mechanical entropy ? and ( c ) what is the object of study ? the attempt to produce conciliatory answers to ( a ) and ( b ) will occupy most of this paper .",

    "the object of study in statistical mechanics is a _ single system _ and all talk of ensembles",
    "can be understood as just a way of giving a relative frequency flavour to the probabilities of events occurring in that system .",

    "[ hdwde ] and [ wntlt ] .",
    "is it possible to designate a part of @xmath3 as the equilibrium state ? on the grounds of the system s reversibility and recurrence we can , of course , discount the possibility that such a region is one which , once entered by the evolving phase point , will not be exited .",
    "as was well - understood by both maxwell and boltzmann , equilibrium must be a state which admits the possibility of fluctuations out of equilibrium . @xcite and",
    "@xcite refer to a particular macrostate as the equilibrium macrostate and the remark by @xcite,[briclab ] that `` by far the largest volumes [ of phase space ] correspond to the _ equilibrium values _ of the macroscopic variables ( and this is how ` equilibrium ' should be defined ) '' is in a similar vein .",
    "so is there a single equilibrium macrostate ? if so it must be that in which the phase point spends more time than in any other macrostate and , if the system were ergodic , it would be the largest macrostate @xmath28 ( see sect .",
    "[ wntlt ] ) , with largest boltzmann entropy .",
    "there is one immediate problem associated with this .",
    "suppose we consider the set of entropy levels @xmath29 , @xmath14 @xmath30 .",
    "then , as has been shown by @xcite for the baker s gas , associated with these levels there may be degeneracies @xmath31 , such that , for some @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the effect of this is that the entropy will be likely , in the course of evolution , to spend more time in a level less than the maximum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "another example , which has been used to discuss the evolution of boltzmann s entropy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 1 ) and which we shall use as an illustrative example in this paper , is the kac ring model @xcite . up or down spins distributed equidistantly around a circle .",
    "randomly distributed at some of the midpoints between the spins are @xmath35 spin flippers .",
    "the dynamics consists of rotating the spins ( but not the spin - flippers ) one spin - site in the clockwise direction , with spins changing their direction when they pass through a spin flipper .",
    "@xmath3 consists of the @xmath36 points , corresponding to all combinations of the two spin states , and is decomposable into dynamically invariant cycles .",
    "if @xmath35 is even the parity of @xmath37 is preserved along a cycle which has maximum size @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath35 is odd the parity of @xmath37 alternates with steps along a cycle and the maximum cycle size is @xmath38 . ]",
    "macrostates in this model can be indexed @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the macrostate with @xmath41 up spins and @xmath42 down spins , giving @xmath43 then , of course , @xmath44 with @xmath45 monotonically decreasing with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "but , although the maximum macrostate is unique , @xmath47 , @xmath14 @xmath48 and the entropy level corresponding to the largest volume of @xmath3 is given , for @xmath49 , by the macrostate pair @xmath50 .",
    "it may be suppose that this question of degeneracy is an artifact of relevance only for small @xmath1 .",
    "it is certainly the case , both for the baker s gas and kac ring , that , if @xmath51 is a macrostate which maximizes @xmath52 , although @xmath53 , @xmath54 , as @xmath55 .",
    "so , maybe the union of @xmath56 and all the equally - sized macrostates with measure @xmath57 can be used as the equilibrium state . to test this possibility",
    "take the kac ring and consider the partial sum @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the union of all @xmath60 with @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "then it is not difficult to show that , for fixed @xmath37 , @xmath62 the proportion of @xmath3 contained within the band of macrostates @xmath59 decreases with @xmath1 . with @xmath63 for large @xmath1 .",
    "the proportion of phase space in the largest macrostate _ decreases _ with @xmath1 . ]",
    "if we want the equilibrium region to satisfy the property described in the quote given above from @xcite , then this can not be done by designating a band of a fixed number of macrostates in this way . to ensure that as @xmath1 becomes large `` by far the largest volumes [ of phase space ] correspond to the _ equilibrium values _ of the macroscopic variables '' we need to choose a value of @xmath37 increasing with @xmath1 .",
    "thus for example to create an ` equilibrium band of macrostates ' containing @xmath64 of @xmath3 we must choose @xmath65 , for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 . an entropy profile for this last case",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     against time , for a kac ring of @xmath71 spins .",
    "there are @xmath72 spin - flippers , distributed randomly around the ring and the evolution is initiated in the low - entropy state @xmath73 .",
    "the upper and lower horizontal lines correspond respectively to @xmath74 and @xmath75.,width=453 ]    the putative equilibrium state , representing @xmath64 of @xmath76 is given by the region bounded by the horizontal lines in the figure .",
    "if the system were ergodic ( like the baker s gas ) we would expect the system to spend almost all of the 10,000 time steps in this region , whereas in this particular simulation only 4658 steps satisfied this condition .",
    "this is to be expected as the kac ring is not ergodic , but has an ergodic decomposition into cycles of which this figure represents half a cycle .",
    "is odd . the second half of the cycle in which the spins are reverse has an identical entropy profile .",
    "] the proportion of ` equilibrium states ' will differ between cycles .",
    "so the problems with defining an equilibrium region are :    a.   just choosing the largest macrostate as the equilibrium region , does not guarantee that this region becomes an increasing proportion of phase space as @xmath1 increases .",
    "in fact the reverse is the case for the kac ring .",
    "b.   any choice of a collection of macrostates to represent equilibrium is : a.   arbitrary : leading to an arbitrary division between fluctuations _ within _ and _ out of _ equilibrium , as is shown in the profile in fig .",
    "b.   difficult : as we have shown in the kac ring .",
    "except for ergodic systems there is no clear way to make a choice which guarantees that the system will spend most of its time in equilibrium .",
    "the choice of a region consisting of @xmath64 of phase space still yields an evolution where only about @xmath77 of the points on the trajectory lie within it .",
    "but why define equilibrium in this binary way ?",
    "we suggest that the quality which we are trying to capture is a matter of degree , rather than the two - valued property of either being _ in equilibrium _ or _ not in equilibrium_. we , therefore , make the following proposal :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ definition ( c):_all references to a system being , or not being , in equilibrium should be replaced by references to the * commonness * of the state of the system , with this property being measured by ( some possibly - scaled form of ) the boltzmann entropy . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      by this we mean that most initial states of the system should lead tothermodynamic - like behaviour . before discussing the dynamic properties needed for this , we shall refer briefly to the more limited notion of typicality employed by the neo - boltzmannians and contained in the assertion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s348 ) `` that @xmath78 will _ typically _ be increasing in a way which _ explains _ and describes qualitatively the evolution towards equilibrium of macroscopic systems '' .",
    "the conditions for this to be the case were first discussed by @xcite .",
    "consider a macrostate @xmath32 divided into four parts @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , where @xmath80 consists of those points in @xmath32 which have evolved from a smaller macrostate and which evolve into a larger macrostate , with the other parts defined in a similar way . on grounds of symmetry ,",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are both in @xmath32 , then @xmath83 ; otherwise the macrostates will be in reversal pairs with plus and minus signs interchanged . in order for forward evolution to a larger macrostate to be typical",
    "it must be the case that the overwhelmingly largest part of @xmath32 is @xmath82 .",
    "this was asserted without proof by @xcite .",
    "more recent arguments have been advanced from the point of view that a macrostate is more likely to be surrounded by larger macrostates or that it is easier to ` aim at ' a larger , rather than a smaller , neighbouring macrostate . even accepting this argument",
    ", it can at the most explain how , if the state of a system is assigned randomly to a point in a macrostate , then the subsequent first transition is to a larger macrostate .",
    "as was pointed out by @xcite , it gives no explanation for the entropy direction at the next transition , since the part of the macrostate occupied after the first transition will be determined by the dynamics . in any case",
    ", we wish to argue that this is a too narrowly defined version of typicality , which should be applied to thermodynamic - like behaviour over the whole evolution .",
    "we have already argued in sect .",
    "[ hdwde ] that commonness or ` equilibriumness ' is a matter of degree and it is clear that thermodynamic - like behaviour is also a matter of degree , for which we need to proposed a measure .",
    "a difference between these properties is that commoness is something which can be assessed at an instant of time , whereas thermodynamic - like behaviour is a temporally global property assessed over the whole trajectory .",
    "let @xmath84 be a trajectory in @xmath3 identified ( uniquely ) by the property that it passes through the point @xmath23 and let @xmath85 be the proportion of time which the phase point evolving along @xmath84 spends in the some @xmath86 .",
    "exists and is independent of the location of @xmath23 on @xmath84 for almost all ( f.a.a . ) @xmath87 ; that is , except possibly for a set of @xmath10-measure zero . from this",
    "it follows ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that @xmath85 is a constant of motion f.a.a .",
    "@xmath87 . ]",
    "definition tl1 is an informal qualitative definition of thermodynamic - like behaviour , for which we need the entropy profile of @xmath27 , not only to be quite close to @xmath88 for most of its evolution , but also for fluctuations around this value to be fairly small .",

    "the trajectory investigated for figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] the actual difference is given in ( [ wntlt5 ] ) , a value which is likely to decrease with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "it is often said that in `` equilibrium [ the gibbs entropy ] agrees with boltzmann and clausius entropies ( up to terms that are negligible when the number of particles is large ) and everything is fine '' @xcite . interpreted within the present context",
    "this means that the good approximation @xmath146 , for the entropy per microsystem of a system for which thermodynamic - like behaviour is typical , can be replace by @xmath147 .",
    "the advantage of this substitution is obvious , since the first expression is dependent on the division into macrostates and second is not .",
    "however a little care is needed in justifying this substitution .",
    "it is not valid because , as asserted in the quote from @xcite on page , @xmath56 occupies an increasing proportion of @xmath93 as @xmath1 increases .",
    "indeed , we have shown for the kac ring the reverse is the case .",
    "that proportion becomes vanishingly small as @xmath1 increases .",
    "however , the required substitution can still be made , since for that model @xmath148 although it may seem that the incorrect intuition on the part of @xcite et al .",
    "concerning the growth in the relative size of the largest macrostate , leading as it does to the correct conclusion with respect to entropy , is easily modified and of no importance , we have shown in sect .",
    "[ hdwde ] that it has profound consequences for the attempt to define equilibrium in the boltzmann approach .",
    "it should be emphasized that the gibbs entropy ( [ rgb4 ] ) is no longer taken as that of some ( we would argue ) non - existent equilibrium state , but as an approximation to the true thermodynamic entropy which is the time - average over macrostates of the boltzmann entropy .",
    "the use of a time - independent probability density function for the gibbs entropy is not because the system is at equilibrium but because the underlying dynamics is autonomous .",
    "the thermodynamic entropy approximated by the gibbs entropy ( [ rgb4 ] ) remains constant if the phase space remains unchanged but changes discontinuously if a change in external constraints leads to a change in @xmath93 .",
    "an example of this , for a perfect gas in a box when a partition is removed , is considered by @xcite who shows that the boltzmann entropy follows closely the step change in the gibbs entropy .",
    "in our programme for reconciling the boltzmann and gibbs approaches to statistical mechanics we have made use both of ergodicity and ergodic decomposition and there is deep ( and justified ) suspicion of the use of ergodic arguments , particularly among philosophers of physics .",
    "argue `` that ergodic theory in its traditional form is unlikely to play more than a cameo role in whatever the final explanation of the success of equilibrium statistical mechanics turns out to be '' . in its ` traditional form '",
    "the ergodic argument goes something like this : ( a ) measurement processes on thermodynamic systems take a long time compared to the time for microscopic processes in the system and thus can be effectively regarded as infinite time averages .",
    "( b ) in an ergodic system the infinite time average can be shown , for all but a set of measure zero , to be equal to the macrostate average with respect to an invariant normalized measure which is unique .",
    "the traditional objections to this argument are also well known : ( i ) measurements may be regarded as time averages , but they are not _ infinite _ time averages . if they were one could not , by measurement , investigate a system not in equilibrium .",
    "in fact , traditional ergodic theory does not distinguish between systems in equilibrium and not in equilibrium .",
    "( ii ) ergodic results are all to within sets of measure zero and one can not equate such sets with events with zero probability of occurrence .",
    "( iii ) rather few systems have been shown to be ergodic .",
    "so one must look for a reason for the success of equilibrium statistical mechanics for non - ergodic systems and when it is found it will make the ergodicity of ergodic systems irrelevant as well .",
    "our use of ergodicity differs substantially from that described above and it thus escapes wholly or partly the strictures applied to it . in respect of the question of equilibrium / non - equilibrium we argue that the reason this does not arise in ergodic arguments is that equilibrium does not exist .",
    "the phase point of the system , in its passage along a trajectory , passes through common ( high entropy ) and uncommon ( low entropy ) macrostates _ and that is all_. so we can not be charged with ` blurring out ' the period when the system was not in equilibrium .",
    "the charge against ergodic arguments related to sets of measure zero is applicable only if one wants to argue that the procedure always works ; that is that non - thermodynamic - like behaviour never occurs .",
    "but we have , in this respect taken a boltzmann view .",
    "we need thermodynamic - like behaviour to be typical and we have proposed conditions for this to be the case .",
    "but we admit the possibility of atypical behaviour occurring with small but not - vanishing probability .",
    "while the class of systems admitting a finite or denumerable ergodic decomposition is likely to be much larger than that of the purely ergodic systems , there remains the difficult question of determining general conditions under which the temporal behaviour along a trajectory , measured in terms of visiting - times in macrostates , approximates , in most members of the ergodic decomposition , to thermodynamic - like behaviour .",
