    "the past decade has witnessed great advances in both the fields of cold atoms and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) , and the overlap between the two fields is ever - growing .",
    "a remarkable achievement in this direction is the successful coupling of a bose - einstein condensate to a quantized field mode of a high - finesse optical cavity @xcite . besides that",
    ", deterministic loading of individual atoms in a micro - cavity is demonstrated @xcite and submicron positioning of single atoms in the cavity is achieved @xcite , which allows control of the atom - field coupling via its position - dependence .",
    "theoretically , mekhov , maschler , and ritsch proposed to probe the superfluid - insulator transition of cold atoms in optical lattices by the transmission spectra of an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "the atoms couple to a quantized cavity mode dispersively and hence act as some moving refractive media in the cavity .",
    "the cavity transmission spectra directly reflects the quantum or classical distributions of the atoms , which characterize the superfluid or insulator phases respectively .",
    "this non - destructive proposal exploits the fact that in the domain of strong coupling , even one atom is enough to shift the cavity resonance significantly .",
    "techniques based on this knowledge have been developed to detect the existence of atoms in a cavity @xcite , and most recently , been employed to study the correlation , statistics and dynamics of matter - wave fields @xcite .    from the point of view of atomic optics and quantum information ,",
    "@xcite also provides us with a model of rich coupled atom - field dynamics @xcite .",
    "the atoms effectively influence the field dynamics by shifting the resonance of the field mode , while in turn the field intensity determines the dipole potential for the atoms .",
    "the former effect is essential for the result of ref .",
    "@xcite and is treated in detail .",
    "however , the latter effect is neglected .",
    "the atomic dynamics is avoided by prescribing a state ( phase ) for the atoms .",
    "furthermore , the interaction and the coupling to the environment may induce entanglement between the atomic and field subsystems , and cause decoherence of the subsystems , respectively .",
    "all these aspects of the system are rarely investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of the composite atom - field system , with the emphasis on the interplay between the two sides , the correlation and the entanglement between them .",
    "we shall consider a `` two - site version '' of the model presented in ref .",
    "atoms are trapped in a double - well potential and interact dispersively with a damped and driven field mode .",
    "the two traps are placed asymmetric to the field mode so that the atomic tunneling dynamics is coupled to the field dynamics . under the two - mode approximation ,",
    "the freedoms of the atoms are reduced to minimum and can be taken into full account . to gain insight into the dynamics of the system , we assume the system starts from an initial state and evolves towards the steady state .",
    "we find that this process involves two distinct time scales , one is the atomic tunneling rate and the other the cavity loss rate , with the latter much faster than the former .",
    "these two incommensurate time scales lead to distinct temporal structures of the dynamics . in the short - time interval , where the atomic tunneling can be neglected",
    ", it is found that the model we consider is analogous to the dicke model in the dispersive regime , for which a good understanding exists @xcite .",

    ", however , the atomic tunneling plays an important role .",
    "strong population transfer between different atomic states is observed , and the system displays substantially different behavior than in the short - time interval .",

    "[ sec 2 ] the basic model is introduced and the hamiltonian of the atom - field system is derived under the two - mode approximation . then in sec .",
    "[ sec 3 ] , based on the master equation , the short - time and long - time behaviors are investigated both analytically and numerically .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec 4 ] .",
    "the connection with the dicke model is discussed in appendix a and some useful inequalities are derived in appendix b.",
    "in this work , we consider the combination of a double - well and an optical cavity , two paradigm models in physics .",
    "we assume @xmath0 two - level bosonic atoms with mass @xmath1 and transition frequency @xmath2 are trapped in a double - well potential @xmath3 and loaded in an optical cavity , where they interact with a cavity field mode with frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the cavity is coherently pumped through the mirror by a weak laser with frequency @xmath5 and amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "we also assume the atom - field detuning is much larger than the atomic spontaneous emission rate and the rabi frequency . under this condition ,",
    "the atomic upper level can be adiabatically eliminated @xcite , i.e. , the atomic internal dynamics is neglected .",
    "after adiabatic elimination of the atomic upper state , the single - atom - plus - field hamiltonian in the frame rotating at the frequency of the pumping field is  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rotating frame hamiltonian for the driven field , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the pump - cavity detuning , and @xmath11 which is the hamiltonian for a single atom in the superposition of the classical potential @xmath3 and the quantum potential @xmath12  @xcite . here",

    "the atomic tunneling rate @xmath37 and the on - site interaction energy @xmath38 are defined as @xmath39 @xmath40 describes the interaction between the atoms and the field , @xmath41 where the dimensionless coefficients @xmath42 are defined as @xmath43 which reflect the overlap between the atomic modes and the field mode .",
    "note that @xmath42 are bounded , @xmath44 , which follows from the normalization conditions of @xmath13 and @xmath45 .",
    "if the field mode @xmath13 varies slowly in the range of the spread of the atomic modes , we can take the `` tight confinement approximation ''  @xcite @xmath46 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) that the interaction between the atoms and the field is twofold . for the atoms ,",
    "the depths of the two traps are shifted while for the field the energy per photon is renormalized .",
    "we shall discriminate two different cases : ( 1 ) @xmath47 ; ( 2 ) @xmath48 .",
    "the former case is trivial , because in this case the dynamics of the atoms and the field is decoupled , the field is indifferent to the distribution of the atoms in the two traps .",
    "thus we concentrate on the case @xmath49 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "this is always reasonable mathematically because we can define two effective parameters , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath54 then effectively we have @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "experimentally , excellent control of the position of a single atom relative to the cavity mode has been demonstrated , so atom - field coupling can be tailored as wanted  @xcite . in the following , we shall omit the prime for notational simplicity .",
    "the hamiltonian derived above controls the coherent evolution of the atom - field system . however , we still have to take the dissipation into account , which comes from the cavity loss in the model we consider .",
    "the overall evolution of the system is governed by the master equation : @xmath55+\\kappa(2a\\rho a^\\dagger- a^\\dagger a \\rho- \\rho a^\\dagger a )     \\equiv \\mathcal { l } \\rho.\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the density matrix of the atom - field system in the rotating frame , and @xmath57 is the cavity loss rate .",
    "note that generally the frequency of the cavity mode falls in the optical regime , hence the environment can be treated as at zero temperature .",
    "the master equation will be our starting point for the rest of the paper .",
    "as for the dynamics of our system , we stress that there are two distinct time scales @xcite .",
    "one is the inverse of the atomic tunneling rate @xmath58 , the other being that of the cavity loss rate @xmath59 .",
    "they are the characteristic times of the atomic and field subsystems , respectively . in typical experimental situations",
    ", @xmath57 is of order @xmath60 hz , while @xmath37 ( and @xmath38 ) is of order @xmath61 hz at most @xcite .",
    "this means that generally there is a hierarchy @xmath62 .",
    "the identification of two different time scales leads us to classify the dynamics of the system into _",
    "short- _ and _ long- _ time behaviors , which correspond to two disjoint time intervals , ( 1 ) @xmath63 and ( 2 ) @xmath64 , respectively . in the short - time interval ,",
    "the atomic tunneling is `` frozen '' .",
    "however , we still expect the system to display some non - trivial behaviors , because this time may be long in unit of @xmath59 . in the long - time interval , the atomic tunneling may eventually give rise to some important results and should be taken into full account .",
    "specifically we divide the hamiltonian @xmath65 into tunneling and non - tunneling terms , @xmath66 with @xmath67 and rewrite the master equation as @xmath68+\\kappa(2 a \\rho a^\\dagger - a^\\dagger a \\rho- \\rho a^\\dagger      a)-i[h_{t},\\rho].\\ ] ] the last term will be neglected ( kept ) in the short- ( long- ) time intervals , respectively . in the following",

    "in terms of schwinger s representation of the angular momentum operators @xcite , @xmath187 the hamiltonian @xmath65 can be rewritten as @xmath188 with @xmath189 up to terms diagonal in the @xmath190-representation , @xmath74 corresponds to the dicke model in the dispersive regime @xcite , with cavity - pump detuning @xmath191 , effective atom - field coupling @xmath192 and pump strength @xmath6 .",
    "it is the two center - of - mass motion modes that correspond to the two atomic internal levels involved in the dicke model .    in this formalism , it is clear that the role of @xmath193 is to induce transitions between different eigenstates of @xmath190 ( that is , the @xmath194 s , @xmath195 ) , with amplitudes proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "however , since @xmath196 , this process can be neglected in the short - time interval .",
    "we first introduce an inequality @xcite , @xmath197 where @xmath198 , @xmath199 are two arbitrary operators ( hermitian or non - hermitian ) , and the average is taken over an arbitrary state ( pure or mixed ) .",
    "let @xmath200 , @xmath201 ( unity operator ) in eq.([general inequality ] ) , we obtain @xmath202 for steady states , we have this inequality plus the constraint eq.([ata motion ] ) , hence @xmath203",
