    "identifying the origin of the dark matter of the universe is one of the priorities of modern high - energy physics and astronomy .",
    "so far , many particle physics models of the dark matter have been proposed ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews ) , and well - motivated candidates are so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and axions .",
    "both of them possess suitable properties for the dark matter in that they are nonbaryonic , cold , and collisionless .",
    "however , the nature of cosmological behavior is completely different between wimps and axions .",
    "wimps are produced from a primordial soup of radiations , and their population is fixed when they decouple from the thermal plasma .",
    "we can interpret them as a collection of classical particles , whose velocity dispersion is determined by the decoupling temperature . on the other hand , axions are produced nonthermally , having a small velocity dispersion compared with the temperature of the thermal plasma at the epoch when they are produced .",
    "furthermore , they have a huge occupation number in the phase space since they are bosons . because of these properties , we interpret them as a classical field rather than individual particles .",
    "this classical field of axions coherently oscillating in the field space behaves as a cold matter component of the universe  @xcite .",
    "these curious properties of dark matter axions motivate the possibility that axions form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the energy dispersion of axions at the production time @xmath0 is much smaller than the critical temperature for bec , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number density of axions . used in  @xcite is applied for relativistic particles , which might not be appropriate for cold axions because they are non - relativistic .",
    "even though , the condition @xmath3 is also satisfied if we use the expression for non - relativistic particles , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the axion .",
    "] however , this argument relies on the following assumptions .",
    "first , the particles must be bosons .",
    "second , their number must be conserved .",
    "third , they should have huge phase space density .",
    "finally , they must be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the first three conditions are obviously satisfied for dark matter axions , but the final one , whether axions thermalize or not , is a nontrivial issue .    the cosmic thermalization of axions is extensively discussed in ref .  @xcite . here",
    ", the thermalization means that the system relaxes into a state with the highest entropy by exchanging energies and momenta between particle states . in order to investigate such a process ,",
    "some statistical mechanical treatments are required .",
    "the usual analysis using the boltzmann equation can not be applied to this problem , since highly degenerate axions are essentially fields in the classical limit .",
    "such a system of axion fields does not match the assumption of the boltzmann analysis , where the system is considered to be a collection of point particles .",
    "this situation defines a peculiar regime of the many body system , called the condensed regime , which should be distinguished from the particle kinetic regime where the boltzmann analysis can be applied . in the condensed regime ,",
    "the energy transfer of the scattering process is small compared with the scattering rate , because the interaction occurs between highly degenerate states .",
    "thermalization in the condensed regime is not well understood in comparison with that of the particle kinetic regime .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the thermalization process in the condensed regime is analyzed by describing the axion field as a set of quantum - mechanical oscillators ( i.e. quantum operators ) and deriving the evolution equation of each oscillator .",
    "however , in the formalism of  @xcite the thermalization rate is estimated by comparing the `` orders of magnitude '' of quantum operators , and the occurrence of the thermalization is confirmed only by computing the quantum - mechanical averages of the occupation number of each oscillator numerically , which is realized for toy models with a small number of oscillators and particles .",
    "it is impossible to realize the actual system with a huge number of axions using the numerical scheme described in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the issue of the axion thermalization .",
    "the purpose of this work is to develop a robust tool to describe the relaxation process of highly degenerate bosonic fields .",
    "instead of using the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , we compute the expectation value ( i.e. the quantum - mechanical average ) of the occupation number of axions , and solve its time evolution , which informs us of the change of the distribution function of axions",
    ". the computation is executed by using the technology which was originally introduced by schwinger _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , called the `` in - in '' formalism .",
    "this formalism enables us to calculate the time evolution of the expectation value of quantum operator in the systematic way .",
    "furthermore , it can treat a state to which particlelike interpretation is not applied , if we use an appropriate representation for a state at the initial time . in our case",
    ", a coherent state is used to describe a state in the condensed regime . using this formalism",
    ", we estimate the thermalization rate as the inverse of the time scale in which the expectation value of the occupation number changes its value .",
    "whole things can be described in the analytic way , and it is not necessary to use numerical simulations .",
    "the discussion on thermalization of axions and formation of a bec is not only the theoretical issue , but has a relevance to observations .",
    "there are several observational evidences indicating that the phase space structure of galactic halos is consistent with the `` caustic ring model ''  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the high density surfaces ( caustics ) in the phase - space distribution of the dark matter particles become ringlike configurations when dark matter particles fall into a galactic potential with net overall rotation .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that this caustic ring model is predicted if dark matter axions form a bec  @xcite , which might be regarded as an evidence of the axion dark matter .",
    "however , it was also suggested that an axion bec might enter into thermal contact with photons , and modify some cosmological parameters from the standard values  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if axions and photons reach thermal equilibrium , the photon temperature is cooled , which predicts a smaller value of the baryon to photon ratio at the big bang nucleosynthesis and a larger value of the effective number of neutrino species @xmath6 .",
    "the predicted value is @xmath7 , which is larger than the observed value @xmath8-@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this result seems to be disapproval of axion bec dark matter , but we find that such photon cooling effects are fictitious .",
    "as will be shown later , axions do not enter into thermal contact with photons , though they develop toward a bec .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the method to evaluate the time evolution of the occupation number of axions . the expectation value of the quantum operator for the occupation number is computed by using the perturbative expansion in terms of the interaction hamiltonian of the axion field .",
    "we perform the calculation of the leading order terms in perturbation theory , while the second order terms are evaluated in the appendix . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , implications of the results of our analysis on cosmology are discussed .",
    "we estimate the relaxation rate of self - interacting degenerate axions and recover the formula for the thermalization rate of axions , which was obtained in ref .",
    "we will see that the thermalization rate exceeds the expansion rate when the temperature of the universe becomes sufficiently low , at which axions begin to evolve toward a bec . finally , the summary and conclusions are given in sec .",

    "this is because such modes start to oscillate simultaneously at that time and are not dephased .",
    "we note that it is not an exact statement since the onset of the oscillation may vary for each of patches separated by the qcd horizon .",
    "such a difference is at most the order of the magnitude of temperature fluctuations , because the onset of the oscillation is determined by the temperature dependent axion mass [ see eq .  ] .",
    "therefore , the difference in the onset of the oscillation can be simply ignored as long as we consider the transitions in the total number of axions . for this reason",
