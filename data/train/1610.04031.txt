    "in the recent paper @xcite , a new phenomenon was noted in the study of self - affine sponges which only occurs in the higher dimensional case ( d greater than or equal to 3 ) .",
    "the techniques used to calculate the assouad dimension of bedford - mcmullen sponges in that paper fail for what we will call _ partially affine sponges _",
    ", where the condition that each coordinate direction is divided into a strictly different number of pieces @xmath0 is relaxed to @xmath1 .",
    "this paper will introduce a modified argument that is capable of solving this question but still uses similar methods as in @xcite . as such , an understanding of that paper is required for the more technical parts of this one .",
    "many definitions of dimension exist , each with different interesting properties that we would like to study .",
    "one such definition is the assouad dimension which has seen much activity in the past few years , for example @xcite .",
    "we will assume throughout that @xmath2 is a non - empty compact bounded set .",
    "generally the assouad dimension of @xmath3 is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 means open ball of radius @xmath6 and centre @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the smallest number of open sets in @xmath9 with diameter less than or equal to @xmath10 required to cover a bounded set @xmath11 .",
    "when one is considering one of the box dimensions ( upper or lower box ) , it is natural to consider the other at the same time .",
    "similarly the assouad dimension has a natural dual that we will call the lower dimension @xmath12 , following bylund and gudayol @xcite .",
    "other names do exist for the lower dimension but they all use equivalent definitions .",
    "@xmath13    for more information on some of the properties of these dimensions see @xcite but generally the assouad dimension should be considered as giving us information on the ` densest ' part of our set whilst the lower dimension does the same for the ` thinnest ' part , this will become clear in our results .",
    "some of the more common dimensions that exist are the hausdorff and upper and lower box dimensions , which we denote by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , and we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 23 ) for their definitions and basic properties .",
    "when the upper and lower box dimension coincide we will simply call the common value the box dimension ; this is the case in all sets that are considered in this paper .",
    "we will often compare our results to the analogous hasudorff and box dimension results to highlight interesting properties .",
    "for any compact set @xmath3 , we generally have @xmath17      we will now provide the definition of bedford - mcmullen carpets and sponges , some of the most classical self - affine fractals that have been studied .",
    "much work has been spent understanding the dimension theoretic properties of such sets starting from the original works of bedford and mcmullen @xcite , followed by @xcite , to the more recent studies of the assouad dimension in @xcite .",
    "the recent paper by @xcite found an interesting application of these results to answer a long existing open problem in dimension theory on the existence of an ergodic invariant measure of full hausdorff dimension for every expanding repeller , see @xcite for the full statement .",
    "they did this by showing the existence of self - affine sponges where any ergodic invariant measure fully supported on the sponge has a strictly lower hausdorff dimension than the sponge itself .",
    "much of the work in this area was aimed at showing that there always existed such a measure , however sponges are simple enough to study yet with complicated enough structure for their result to be possible .",
    "the following notation is a mixture of olsen s @xcite work with some additional parts introduced in @xcite modified to solve our problem .",
    "bedford  mcmullen sponges _ are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath18 and , for all @xmath19 , choose @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "when these integers are all equal our sponge is simply a strictly self - similar set and the dimension is equal to the similarity dimension since our sponge satisfies the open set condition , see @xcite .",
    "our formula will actually work for this case as well , something that the previous the formula in @xcite was not able to do .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 and consider a fixed digit set @xmath24 with at least two elements .",
    "for @xmath25 we define the affine contraction @xmath26^d \\rightarrow [ 0,1]^d$ ] by @xmath27 thanks to a well known theorem of hutchinson @xmath28 , we know that there exists a unique non - empty compact set @xmath29^d$ ] satisfying @xmath30 called the attractor of the iterated function system ( ifs ) @xmath31 . the attractor @xmath32 is called a _ self - affine sponge _ when constructed with these contractions and when @xmath33 we call the resulting set a _",
    "carpet_. the @xmath34 dimensional case was first considered by bedford and mcmullen separately in @xcite and then @xcite generalised to the @xmath35 dimensional case . without loss of generality we shall assume that @xmath32 does not lie in a hyperplane .",
    "in such cases , we simply restrict our attention to the minimal lower hyperplane containing @xmath32 and consider it as a self - affine sponge in this space .",
    "one advantage of this construction is the ability to link our sponge @xmath32 and the symbolic space @xmath36 , the set of all infinite words over the symbols in @xmath37 equipped with the product topology generated by the cylinders @xmath38 $ ] corresponding to all finite words over @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath39^d$ ] defined below is the key to this property : @xmath40^d)\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for any @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath46    the assouad dimension of bedford - mcmullen sponges was calculated recently in @xcite as long as all of the inequalities in @xmath47 are strict .",
    "an analogous assumption was assumed in @xcite when calculating the assouad and lower dimensions of lalley - gatzouras sponges , a generalisation of the bedford - mcmullen sponges , which indicates that this issue might arise in further generalizations of self - affine sponges .",
    "this problem is unique to the assouad and lower dimensions in the higher dimensional cases ( @xmath35 ) and does not appear in the 2-dimensional case or when considering the hausdorff or box dimensions of sponges .",
    "we call these problematic sponges _ partially affine bedford - mcmullen sponges_. let @xmath48 with @xmath35 such that there is at least one @xmath49 with @xmath50 . using the same method as for the general bedford - mcmullen sponges we obtain an attractor @xmath32 which we define as a partially affine bedford - mcmullen sponge",
    ". the main idea will be to consider the equal coordinates as forming a sort of ` self - similar set inside our self - affine sponge ' and then employ methods that would generally be used in the self - similar setting for these problematic coordinates whilst continuing the original procedures for the ones with strict inequalities .    to simplify notation we define @xmath51 such that @xmath52 then @xmath53 , again with @xmath54 and we continue by induction on the dimension until we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of distinct integers from the list @xmath57 .",
    "so @xmath58 is a collection of @xmath59 dimensions for any @xmath60 and we define @xmath61 , this is the contraction associated to all the coordinates in the @xmath62 collection . this groups the ` self - similar ' parts together and allows us to think of our sponge not as a @xmath63-dimensional strictly self - affine set but a ` @xmath64-dimensional strictly self - affine set ' with some ` dimensions ' actually being several combined coordinates .",
    "a _ pre - fractal _ of an attractor @xmath3 associated to an ifs as defined above is the set defined by the application of all possible combinations of functions in our ifs to an initial set a certain number of times ( the number of times is called the level of the pre - fractal ) .",
    "as the level tends to infinity , the pre - fractals will converge to our attractor in the hausdorff metric , for any initial set satisfying some simple conditions , e.g. @xmath65^d$ ] . for a more detailed explanation",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we will later consider sets that are similar to the @xmath66th pre - fractal of a sponge @xmath32 @xmath67^d),\\ ] ] which is a collection of @xmath68 hypercuboids .",
    "below is a figure of the first pre - fractals for a given partially affine bedford - mcmullen sponge , we can already see how they will converge to our attractor @xmath32 .    .5   where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .5   where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the technique used for the upper bound for the assouad dimension will require an understanding of _ bernoulli measures _ supported on the set , thankfully ifs provides a nice way of constructing such measures by defining a borel probability measure on the symbol space and then using the push - forward @xmath73 to acquire a bernoulli measure on our set .",
    "to do this we associate a probability vector @xmath74 with @xmath37 and let @xmath75 be the natural borel product probability measure on @xmath36 , where @xmath76 is the dirac measure on @xmath37 concentrated at @xmath77 .",
    "finally , the measure @xmath78 for a borel set @xmath79 , is our bernoulli measure supported on @xmath32 . for those not familiar with this technique",
    ", one could simply consider the borel probability measure on the symbol space whilst remembering that cylinders and pre - fractals are closely related .",
    "we will later define a bernoulli measure which will be used in the proofs to obtain an upper bound on the assouad dimension .",
    "this measure will reflect both the strict inequalities and the equalities .",
    "for now we simply introduce the notation needed for the construction of the measure and the statement of our result .    for any @xmath80",
    "we define @xmath81 to be the projection onto the first @xmath60 ` clusters ' of coordinates",
    "so say @xmath82 and let @xmath83 and @xmath84 . then , for @xmath85 and @xmath86 let @xmath87 be the number of possible ways to choose the next @xmath88 digits of @xmath89 .",
    "thus @xmath90 is an integer between 1 and @xmath91 , inclusive .",
    "in this paper we will provide an answer to question ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 4.2 ) by calculating the assouad dimension of partially affine bedford - mcmullen sponges , i.e. sponges without the assumption that the @xmath92 are strictly increasing .",
    "[ bedfordmcmullen ] let @xmath32 be a partially affine bedford - mcmullen sponge .",
    "the assouad dimension of @xmath32 is @xmath93 and the lower dimension of @xmath32 is @xmath94    whilst we do not maximise every coordinate as much as possible here in the assouad dimension formula , we should consider any directions that are divided into an equal number of parts to form a sort of ` self - similar set inside the affine sponge ' and the dimension contributed by this ` self - similar ' part is the well - known similarity dimension of the maximal ` column ' within this section , which is as large as possible for that set as all the common dimensions coincide for self - similar sets satisfying the osc .",
    "one of the most interesting points to note however is the first term in these definitions . in the strictly self - affine case",
    ", the formula considers the projection onto the first coordinate and then maximises the remaining dimensions . here",
    "if the first few dimensions have the same contraction ratio then we consider the projection onto the higher dimensional plane and then maximise the following dimensions as explained above .",
    "the other common definitions of dimension ( hausdorff and box ) do not have this property as they only ever consider the projection onto the first axis and then calculate averages over the remaining dimensions , when there is this partial self - affinity the average is simply the similarity dimension and as such does not require a different formula .    comparing the assouad dimension formula to the one obtained in @xcite ,",
    "there are clearly cases where the old formula still holds but many others where the new one is strictly lower .",
    "this occurs when the maximal multi - dimensional columns consist of only maximal 1-dimensional columns that appear in the old formula .",
    "as mentioned previously this phenomena does not occur in the box and hausdorff dimensions or the assouad dimension of carpets and as such it would be interesting to try and find other , non - carpet examples where such an issue manifests .",
    "the assouad and lower dimensions of lalley - gatzouras sponges was rencently calculated in @xcite but their proof relies on a condition analogous to the strict inequality needed in @xcite .",
    "the method used in this paper is powerful enough to solve the partially affine lalley - gatzouras case too but is a simple extension and notationally complex and as such we omit it .",
    "the more general sponges such as baranski sponges do not currently have formulae and it is not clear how different the partially affine cases are .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem [ bedfordmcmullen ] . in [ notation ] we shall introduce any remaining notation that is needed for the proof .",
    "then we will prove the upper bound for the assouad dimension in [ upperbound ] followed by the lower in [ lowerbound ] .",
    "for completeness we will finally include a proof of both the upper and lower bounds for the lower dimension in [ lowerlower ] and [ upperlower ] .",
    "much of this part will be similar to the proof in @xcite so we will omit many of the technical details that have already been covered in that paper but we will nonetheless provide a summary of these techniques .",
    "cylinder sets are unfortunately not optimal covers as such we introduce the approximate cubes which are similar to cylinders and regular cubes at the same time , giving us the tools from the ifs and the optimal covers from cubes .",
    "these will be used extensively throughout our proofs .",
    "for all @xmath98 $ ] we choose the unique integers @xmath99 , greater than or equal to 0 , such that @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , @xmath102 .",
    "we observe that @xmath103 and denote the common value by @xmath104 for any @xmath105 , this is just the integer associated with all the coordinates in @xmath106 .",
    "then the approximate cube @xmath107 of ( approximate ) side length @xmath108 determined by @xmath109 is defined by @xmath110 the geometric analogue of approximate cubes , @xmath111 , is slightly harder to define and is contained in @xmath112;\\ ] ] a hypercuboid in @xmath9 aligned with the coordinate axes and of side lengths @xmath113 , which are all comparable to @xmath10 since @xmath114 .",
    "the lower bound for the assouad dimension will use tangents and is interested in the ` distance ' between sets .",
    "this notion of distance is simply the hausdorff metric @xmath115 defined on the space of non - empty compact subsets of @xmath9 , which is defined by @xmath116_{\\varepsilon } \\text { and } b \\subseteq [ a]_{\\varepsilon } \\big\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath117_{\\varepsilon}$ ] is the closed @xmath118-neighbourhood of a set @xmath119 .",
    "generally one uses a covering argument to obtain the upper bound , however our sponges being @xmath63-dimensional objects makes this idea quite difficult to implement .",
    "instead we can simply use a measure theoretic technique thanks to the following proposition first proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.1 ) and motivated by the measure theoretic definition developed in @xcite :      the proof of this technical lemma is simple and follows from the original definition of assouad dimension , for its proof see the original paper .",
    "essentially it says that if one has a measure satisfying some condition on approximate cubes then we have an upper bound on the assouad dimension .",
    "thankfully we can modify the measure used to this extent in @xcite such that our desired dimension is an upper bound .",
    "the modified measure is defined by @xmath127 again , this is simply the ` coordinate uniform measure ' introduced for the regular sponges except for the coordinates with equal contractions where it is a sort of uniform distribution , as desired .",
    "similarly one can check from the definitions that @xmath128 .",
    "we call this measure the ` partial coordinate uniform measure ' , since it is a modified version of the original",
    ".    there is a precise formula for conditional probabilities on the symbol space as noted in olsen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) , we omit the exact formulation as it simply reduces to , whenever @xmath129 , @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "this conditional probability is just the probability of picking the next set of digits in the set @xmath106 given the previous coordinates .",
    "technically our measure is defined on the pre - fractals of our sponge , not on approximate cubes .",
    "fortunately olsen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 6.2 ) ) noted the following straightforward formula @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "the important fact to note here is that @xmath135 and as such we can combine the conditional probabilities in ( [ approxcubemeasure ] ) when two successive coordinates have the same contraction ratio so @xmath136 .",
    "we are now ready to obtain the upper bound .          for the lower",
    "bound we will use ` weak tangents ' , a technique possible thanks to a proposition of mackay and tyson ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.1.5 ) which was then modified by fraser ( * ? ? ? * proposition 7.7 ) .",
    "this is the section where the original proof in @xcite does not apply , there is however a way around this using some of the ideas detailed so far .",
    "[ tangents ] let @xmath139 be compact and let @xmath3 be a compact subset of @xmath140 , let @xmath141 be a sequence of bi - lipschitz maps defined on @xmath9 with lipschitz constants @xmath142 such that @xmath143 and @xmath144 and suppose that @xmath145 in the hausdorff metric",
    ". then the set @xmath146 is called a _ very weak tangent _ to @xmath3 and , moreover , @xmath147 .    to simplify notation , we choose @xmath148 for @xmath149 to be an element of @xmath37 which attains the maximum value for @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath151 there might be several possibilities for each @xmath152 , but we can pick it arbitrarily .    the rest of this part will be a brief explanation of the technique as it is very similar to that in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to construct a tangent @xmath153 that is some product of self - similar sets whose box dimension can be calculated using common formulas as in @xcite and the box dimension of @xmath153 is simply the desired assouad dimension . to show that this tangent is",
    "indeed a tangent one shows that @xmath154 and @xmath153 are both subsets of a set that is the product of some menger - like sponge and @xmath155 pre - fractals of menger - like sponges which depend on their respective coordinate collection ( and the level depends on @xmath156 ) and then as @xmath156 tends to infinity the hausdorff distance between all theses sets becomes 0 .",
    "there is also a complication that might arise due to the definition of approximate cubes but this is easily circumvented in the assouad dimension case .",
    "the desired tangent is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the menger - like sponge ( equivalently thought of as a strictly self - similar bedford - mcmullen sponge ) obtained by the ifs acting on @xmath159^{a_l}$ ] which forms a sponge identical to the maximal @xmath59-dimensional plane in the @xmath160 to @xmath161 coordinates of our original sponge .",
    "these are simply the cantor sets of the original proof when the contraction ratios are different but self - similar sponges when they are equal .",
    "the set @xmath162 is the geometric projection of the sponge on to the first @xmath163 coordinates ( note that we use the projection function @xmath164 in both the geometric and symbolic spaces ) .    for @xmath165 and @xmath166 ,",
    "we let @xmath167 be the @xmath168 pre - fractal of @xmath158 where our initial set is @xmath159^{a_l}$ ] . in particular , the set @xmath167 is a union of @xmath169 intervals of side lengths @xmath170 .    given a geometric approximate cube @xmath171 , we define a bi - lipschitz map @xmath172^d$ ] ( or @xmath173 ) by @xmath174 thus @xmath175 translates @xmath176 such that the point closest to the origin from the hypercuboid containing @xmath176 becomes the origin and then scales it up by a factor of @xmath177 in each coordinate @xmath60 .",
    "thus these maps take the natural hypercuboid containing @xmath176 precisely to the unit cube @xmath159^d$ ] .",
    "these maps clearly satisfy the conditions imposed by proposition [ tangents ] , i.e. , they are restrictions of bi - lipschitz maps on @xmath9 with constants @xmath178 and @xmath179 satisfying @xmath180 for any @xmath181 .",
    "this follows from the definition of @xmath182 and does not rely on the inequality of @xmath183 .",
