    "general relativity provides an accurate description of a wide range of classical gravitational phenomena",
    ". however , the description breaks down at the space - time singularities . according to the penrose - hawking theorems @xcite",
    "( see also ref . ) , the manifolds arising as solutions of the einstein field equation in general relativity ( gr ) are , in general , geodesically incomplete and thereby indicating the occurrence of space - time singularities like the big - bang singularity in the universe s distant past or the singularity at the center of a black - hole .",
    "the two key assumptions of the singularity theorems are : ( i ) the matter must satisfy strong energy condition ( @xmath1 ; sec ) and ( ii ) space - time must satisfy appropriate causality conditions .",
    "it is now a well accepted fact that a proper understanding of these singularities or their avoidance may require new physics @xcite .",
    "there have been various attempts in the literature , in this direction , for example the scalar - tensor theories of gravity in four ( and other ) dimensions @xcite and the higher derivative gravity @xcite . for the black hole singularity ,",
    "the focus is two fold : ( i ) the _ internal structure of black - holes _ , the issues relating to mass - energy singularity and non - unitary black - hole dynamics , and ( ii ) to understand the final state of the gravitational collapse from some initial configurations .",
    "there has been quite a vigorous activity on the latter aspect for examining the cosmic censorship conjecture ( see for a recent review , see ref . ) ; i.e. is the end product black hole covering the singularity or the singularity naked ? unfortunately this study throws no light on the former aspect , the nature of the singularity .    besides these approaches",
    "there have been attempts to look for non - singular black - hole solutions within the framework of general relativity relaxing the energy conditions on the matter fields @xcite . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the singularity theorems require the stress tensor of the matter to satisfy sec .",
    "the attempts in this direction have been to look for black - hole solutions in which the matter fields satisfy weak energy condition ( @xmath2 ; wec ) . [",
    "note that , from the energy - conservation theorem @xcite , it can be shown that the regular black - holes can not exist for the matter satisfying dominant energy condition .",
    "matter fields satisfying weak energy condition implies null energy condition . ]    the idea of replacing the black - hole singularities by non - singular vacuum cores traces back to bardeen . in this model , bardeen assumed a 4-d spherically symmetric line - element of the form ds^2=(1 - 2 r_g(r ) r ) dt^2- (1 - 2 r_g(r ) r)^-1 dr^2 -r^2 d^2 , [ eq : metric - irina ] where r_g(r ) = where @xmath3 is the mass of the black - hole and @xmath4 is the charge . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the line - element has an event horizon .",
    "it was also shown that the space - time satisfies wec .",
    "various other authors have also proposed regular black - hole solutions ( for an incomplete list of references , please see ref . ) .",
    "recently , dymnikova has obtained a regular exact solution ( [ eq : metric - irina ] ) to the einstein equation , where r_g(r)&=&[1-(-r^3/r_1 ^ 3 ) ] ; + r_1&=&(r_0 ^ 2 r_g)^1/3;^2=3 = l^2 ; r_g= 2 m , [ eq : irina - r ] @xmath6 is related to the positive cosmological constant .",
    "the space - time satisfies wec .",
    "the above line - element has the following interesting properties : ( i ) in the limit of @xmath7 , the line - element goes over to a de sitter ( ii ) asymptotically , the metric goes over to a schwarzschild ( iii ) the metric has two horizons  event and cosmological .",
    "the main aim of this study is to investigate non - singular black - hole solutions in the large extra dimensional model , commonly known as the brane world models . in the recent years",
    ", there has been a renewed interest in models with extra dimensions in which the standard matter fields are confined to the four - dimensional world ( viewed as an infinite hyper - surface ",
    "brane ) embedded in a higher dimensional space - time ( ads bulk ) where _ only _ gravity can propagate . in these models ,",
    "@xmath8-d bulk metric is non - factorizable , and the small value of the true five - dimensional planck mass is related to its large effective four - dimensional value by the large warp of the five - dimensional bulk .",
    "one of the features of the brane models is that it reproduces newtonian potential with higher order corrections .",
    "these corrections contribute significantly in the large curvature limits .",
    "( for a review on brane cosmology see , for instance , ref . .",
    ")    gravitational collapse on the brane has been studied by many authors ( for an incomplete list of references please see refs . ) . in ref . , the authors obtain an exact black - hole solution of the effective einstein equation on the brane under the condition that the bulk has non zero weyl curvature and the brane space - time satisfies the null energy condition .",
    "the solution is given by the usual reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) metric where the charge parameter is thought of as a _ tidal charge _",
    "arising from the projection of the free gravity ( the weyl curvature ) of the bulk onto the brane .",
    "rn metric has thus been interpreted as describing a black hole on the brane where electric charge s role is taken over by the tidal charge and it can be thought of as the analogue of the schwarzschild solution on the brane .",
    "the tidal charge like the rn electric charge would generate @xmath9 term in the potential while the high energy modification to the newtonian potential can not be any stronger than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the cause for this disagreement is the presence of tidal charge which is the measure of the bulk weyl curvature .",
    "the main drawback of the solution is that we do not know the corresponding bulk solution .",
    "it is however agreed that rn metric is a good approximation to a black hole on the brane near the horizon @xcite .",
    "this solution however has a singularity at the center .    in this work",
    ", we would like to look for a non - singular form of the brane black - hole solution obtained in ref . by solving the effective field equations for the induced metric on the brane .",
    "as in many other works , we focus only on the brane equation .",
    "that would mean looking for non - singular version of the usual rn metric .",
    "we shall therefore obtain non - singular rn black - hole solution in a @xmath11-dimensional spherically symmetric space - time which directly corresponds to @xmath11-brane non - singular black - hole in @xmath12-dimensional bulk .",
    "the rn solution @xcite on the brane was obtained by imposing the null energy condition on the 3-brane and assuming that the bulk has non zero weyl curvature .",
    "this gave the rn metric as the unique exact solution of the brane equation .",
    "for obtaining non - singular solution , we have to relax one of the conditions and so we drop the condition of vanishing scalar curvature @xmath0 and however retain the null condition .",
    "the latter will ensure occurrence of horizon which is however required as we wish to find non - singular brane black hole solution .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to obtain a class of static non - singular spherically symmetric brane space - times admitting horizon .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ( 2 ) , we obtain a non - singular rn solution in @xmath11-dimensional spherically symmetric space - time and discuss its properties . in section ( 3 ) , we discuss the implications of the non - singular rn solution in the context of the brane - world model and present our conclusions .",
    "the line - element of a @xmath11-dimensional spherically symmetric space - time is given by ds^2 = g(r ) dt^2 - f(r ) dr^2 - r^2 d^2 . [ eq :- gen - dd ] where @xmath14 is the @xmath15-dimensional angular line - element .",
    "if we assume that the stress tensors satisfy the equation of state of an anisotropic perfect fluid , we then have t^t_t = t^r_r ; t^_1__1 = t^_2__2 = = t^_d-2__d - 2 , which implies @xmath16 .",
    "under this assumption , einstein equations of motion are [ eq : grr ] 8 t^t_t = 8 t^r_r & = & - ( d - 2 ) +  ( ) + 8 t^_i__i & = & - - ( d - 3 ) +  ( ) + [ eq : g - phi ] & = & - + ( d - 4 ) [- +  ( ) ] where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath18 runs from @xmath19 to @xmath15 . integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : grr ] ) , we get g(r ) = 1 - , [ eq : dd - metric - coef ] where r_g(r ) = 4 _ 0^r ( x ) x^d - 2 dx .",
    "[ eq : dd - main ] from the above expression , it is straightforward to see that different choices of @xmath20 will lead to different forms of @xmath21 .",
    "as discussed in introduction , our aim is to look for a @xmath11-dimensional non - singular charged black - hole solution satisfying einstein s equations .",
    "let us consider the following mass and charge distributions _",
    "matter(r ) & = & c_1 + _ charge(r ) & = & (1 - ) - z c_3 c_4 [ eq : dd - density ] where @xmath22 s are constants which need to be determined and @xmath23 is a real number .",
    "the above form of density distributions are regular over all @xmath17 .",
    "the leading order terms of the charge and matter densities go as ( i ) @xmath24 and ( ii ) @xmath25 .",
    "b ) as @xmath7 , we have ( i ) @xmath26 and ( ii ) @xmath27 . ] substituting the above density distributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd - metric - coef ] ) , we get [ eq : dd1-rn ] g(r ) & = & 1- [1 - ( -c_2 r^d -1 ) ] + & + & [1 - ( -c_4 r^2 ( d - 2 ) ) ] + & + &  [ - ] ( [ , c_4 r^2 ( d - 2 ) ] -  [ ] ) where @xmath28 is the gamma function .",
    "the following points need to be noted regarding the above expression :    1 .",
    "the metric coefficients are regular over the whole range of @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   the choice of density in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd - density ] ) satisfies wec .",
    "3 .   in the limit of @xmath29 ,",
    "the above line - element has the form of @xmath13dimensional reissner - nordstrom .",
    "4 .   in the limit of @xmath7 ,",
    "the above line - element reduces to de sitter or anti - de sitter for different choices of @xmath22 s . in the standard gr ,",
    "the central core can only be de sitter .",
    "however , in the case of brane gravity , the central core can either be de sitter or anti - de sitter .",
    "we will discuss this aspect in the next section .",
    ", the author obtained a charged black - hole solution with a charged de sitter core .",
    "it was assumed that the stress tensor of a charged material to have a uniform charge - to - mass ratio over all @xmath17 .",
    "this gave the @xmath17-dependence of the charged density to be the same as that of the @xmath17-dependence for the mass density .",
    "however , the above stress tensor does not satisfy wec as @xmath30 . in our case",
    ", we do not assume any such form for the charge density and as mentioned earlier , the stress tensor satisfies wec all through .",
    "the last term in the rhs of the above expression vanishes near @xmath31 . in the limit of @xmath29 ,",
    "the leading order term is @xmath32 .",
    "using this fact , and setting @xmath33 in the above expression , we get g(r ) & = & 1- [1 - ( -c_2 r^d -1 ) ] + & + & [1 - ( -c_4 r^2 ( d - 2 ) ) ] .",
    "[ eq : dd - rn - gen ] in the rest of this section , we will consider this reduced form for mathematical simplicity .",
    "however , the results derived can be extended to the general case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd1-rn ] ) .",
    "the constants @xmath34 in the above line - element can be determined by taking the two limits  @xmath29 and @xmath7  and identifying them with the mass ( @xmath3 ) , charge ( @xmath35 ) and the cosmological constant ( @xmath6 ) . we , thus , have - & = & 0 + c_3 = ( d - 2 ) ( d -3 ) + ^(d - 3 ) ^(d - 1 )",
    "- r_g l^2 ^(d - 3 ) + q^2 l^2 & = & 0 , where , the lower(upper ) sign corresponds to anti(de sitter ) core , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "even though , the solution to the above algebraic equations are complicated , one can in - principle solve it . in the case of @xmath38 ,",
    "we have =  [ - 1 ] ^1/2 where a & = & + + b & = & [9 + r_g^-3/2 ] ^1/3 in the limit of @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 .",
    "this coincides with the result of ref . .",
    "as noted earlier , in the case of standard general relativity @xmath41 is always non - negative and hence the center has a de sitter core .",
    "in ref . , the analogue of the schwarzschild solution was obtained by solving the modified vacuum equation on the brane .",
    "the bulk space - time was taken to have non zero weyl curvature . in order to solve the equation completely , the authors imposed null energy condition on the 3-brane . using this condition ,",
    "it was shown that rn metric is the unique exact solution on the brane .",
    "the null condition ensures occurrence of horizon which is what is required for a black hole solution , however , this condition need to hold _ only _ at the horizon and _ not necessarily _ everywhere else .",
    "this is the situation for the einstein - yang - mills black - hole solutions in 4d gravity where the null energy condition holds only at the horizon @xcite .",
    "numerical black - hole solutions have been obtained in which the solution is ( i ) rn at the horizon and ( ii ) schwarzschild asymptotically . for regularity",
    ", space - time would not ( as in the schwarzschild case ) be empty and hence the scalar curvature would in general be non zero even though the stress tensor contributed by the bulk weyl curvature would be trace free .",
    "it is then possible to obtain a class of static non - singular spherically symmetric brane space - times admitting horizon . for a non - singular black hole on the brane ,",
    "it is enough to find a regular version of the rn metric which is taken to describe a black hole on the brane . in the preceding section ,",
    "we have obtained a regular version of the rn metric in @xmath11-dimensional space - time;i.e . a regular black - hole solution on @xmath42-brane .",
    "it would be interesting to find a generalization in which the null energy condition holds only at the horizon but not globally .",
    "the solution would however be numerical as is the case for the einstein - yang - mills black hole .    even though , the brane black - hole solution is analogous to that of the rn solution in standard general relativity , the horizon and the singularity structure of the two black - holes are quite different .",
    "it depends on the sign of @xmath41 . for the rn solution of the standard general relativity , @xmath43 because electric field energy is positive and it leads to the familiar two horizons .",
    "however , for the brane black - hole solution it has been argued that @xmath41 must be negative as it arises from the free gravitational field ( which should have negative energy [ ] ) of the bulk space - time [ ] .",
    "it is expected that the black - hole on the brane should in the low energy limit imply corrections to the schwarzschild solution but its singularity and horizon structure should however remain undisturbed .",
    "this can only happen if @xmath44 .",
    "the black hole core could have been de sitter or anti de sitter depending upon @xmath41 being positive or negative . since",
    "this ambiguity has been resolved in favor of @xmath44 , the black hole center would be ads .",
    "asymptotically it approaches rn / schwarzschild space - time while in the interior it would go to ads at the center .",
    "the line - element ( [ eq :- gen - dd ] ) with @xmath45 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd - rn - gen ] ) describes a regular black - hole space - time free of singularity and it admits like the schwarzschild black - hole only one horizon . since the requirement of regularity is not uniquely specifiable , the regular solution so obtained would not however be unique .",
    "the field is therefore quite open and it is only the physical properties that would distinguish one solution from the other .",
