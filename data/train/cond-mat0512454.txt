    "low - energy electron excitations in solids can be successfully described in terms of quasiparticles in the landau theory of fermi liquids.@xcite an excited quasiparticle with definite momentum is not stable due to scattering by phonons , disorders , and other electrons .",

    "huge progress has also been made , by the use of the techniques of ultrafast laser , in measuring the lifetime of photonexcited electrons in metals such as copper.@xcite these advances have made it possible to carry out quantitive comparisons between theories and experiments .",
    "the theory of the inelastic lifetime in three dimensions ( 3d ) is rather well established within random phase approximation.@xcite it was later extended to include the exchange contribution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion).@xcite several theoretical investigations had also been carried out in 2d , but with quantitive disagreement.@xcite in an earlier paper,@xcite hereafter referred as i , we have managed to clarify the origin of the disagreement that exists among these previous investigations .",
    "the results in i are summarized as follows .",
