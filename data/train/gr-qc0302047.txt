    "one of the most interesting problem of relativity is the energy and momentum localization .",
    "the different attempts at constructing an energy - momentum density do nt give a generally accepted expression . however , there are various energy - momentum complexes including those of einstein [ 1]-[2 ] , landau and lifshitz [ 3 ] , papapetrou [ 4 ] , bergmann [ 5 ] , weinberg [ 6 ] and mller [ 7 ] .",
    "cooperstock [ 8 ] gave his opinion that the energy and momentum are confined to the regions of non - vanishing energy - momentum tensor of the matter and all non - gravitational fields .",
    "although , the energy - momentum complexes are coordinate dependent they can give a reasonable result . to get meaningful results for the energy distribution using the energy - momentum complexes of einstein ,",
    "landau and lifshitz , papapetrou , bergmann and weinberg the calculations are carried out in cartesian coordinates .",
    "some interesting results recently obtained sustain this conclusion [ 9]-[14 ] .",
    "the mller energy - momentum complex [ 7 ] no needs to carry out calculations in cartesian coordinates so we can calculate in any coordinate system .",
    "some results recently obtained [ 15]-[18 ] sustain that the mller energy - momentum complex is a good tool for obtaining the energy distribution in a given space - time .",
    "also , in his recent paper , lessner [ 19 ] gave his opinion that the mller definition is a powerful concept of energy and momentum in general relativity .",
    "also , chang , nester and chen [ 20 ] showed that the energy - momentum complexes are actually quasilocal and legitimate expression for the energy - momentum .",
    "they concluded that there exist a direct relationship between energy - momentum complexes and quasilocal expressions because every energy - momentum complexes is associated with a legitimate hamiltonian boundary term .",
    "sen metric [ 24 ] is new and is becoming very important .",
    "so , we find to be of interest to study its energy distribution .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the energy distribution of this charged black hole solution in heterotic string theory in the mller prescription .",
    "we use geometrized units ( @xmath0 ) and follow the convention that latin indices run from 0 to 3 .",
    "the low - energy effective field theory describing string theory contains black hole ( or , more generally , black p - brane ) solutions which can have properties which are qualitatively different from those that appear in ordinary einstein gravity [ 21 ] .    rotating charge - neutral black hole solutions",
    "can be constructed in string theory , and are identical to the kerr solution [ 22 ] of ordinary einstein gravity with the dilaton taking a constant value . rotating charged black hole solutions in these theories have been analyzed [ 23 ] in the limit of small angular momentum .",
    "the solution constructed by a. sen [ 24 ] is an exact classical solution in the low - energy effective field theory , which describes a black hole carrying a finite amount of charge and angular momentum .",
    "the method he used is the twisting procedure ( see references [ 4]-[8 ] in [ 24 ] ) that generates inequivalent classical solutions starting from a given classical solution of string theory .",
    "he generated the rotating charged black hole solution by starting from a rotating black hole solution carrying no charge , like the kerr solution [ 22 ] .",
    "for the black hole solution obtained by a. sen we consider the case when the angular momentum is zero .",
    "we have two cases .    in the first case , the metric ( obtained from eq . ( 11 ) in [ 24 ] ) is given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is an arbitrary number .",
    "the metric given by ( 1 ) describes a black hole solution with mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 given by @xmath5 and , respectively , @xmath6 .    in the second case , the einstein metric ( @xmath7 , with @xmath8 given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) in [ 24 ] and obtained from eq .",
    "( 16 ) in [ 24 ] ) is given by    @xmath9    the mller energy - momentum complex @xmath10 [ 7 ] is given by    @xmath11    where    @xmath12    also , @xmath10 satisfies the local conservations laws    @xmath13    @xmath14 is the energy density and @xmath15 are the momentum density components .",
    "the energy is given by    @xmath16    for the metric given by ( 1 ) the @xmath17 component is given by    @xmath18    using ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , after some calculations and applying the gauss theorem we obtain the energy distribution    @xmath19    the graphic representation for the energy distribution is given in the fig .",
    "1    from ( 8) we observe that the energy distribution depends on @xmath2 . in the case",
    "@xmath20 we obtain    @xmath21    for the metric given by ( 2 ) the @xmath17 component is given by    @xmath22    using ( 10 ) and ( 6 ) , after some calculations and applying the gauss theorem we obtain the energy distribution    @xmath23    for the energy distribution we have the graphic representation from the fig . 2    also ,",
    "in this case if we have @xmath20 we obtain    @xmath24",
    "bondi [ 25 ] gave his opinion that a nonlocalizable form of energy is not admissible in relativity .",
    "as we pointed out [ 9]-[18 ] , there are many important results recently obtained which sustain the view point of bondi .    for the metrics given by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we obtained the expressions for the energy distribution in the mller prescription given by ( 8) and ( 11 ) .",
    "the first term is the same in both ( 8) and ( 11 ) and the second , the third and the fourth terms in ( 8) are twice than their values in ( 11 ) .",
    "the energy distribution depends on the arbitrary number @xmath2 . also , because the dependence of @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the independent physical parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see eqs .",
    "( 19 ) in [ 24 ] ) , the energy distribution depends on the mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 of the black hole . in the case",
    "@xmath20 we obtain that @xmath27 .",
    "these results sustain that the mller energy - momentum complex is a powerful tool for obtaining the energy distribution in a given space - time .",
    "sen  metric represents black hole as well as naked singularities depending on the ratio of the mass to the electric charge parameters . recently , virbhadra and a very reputed general relativist ellis , pioneered gravitational lensing by very strong fields of black holes as well as naked singularities[26 ] in order to test the well - known cosmic censorship hypothesis of roger penrose .",
    "i suggest that these studies be repeated with the sen metric .",
    "this will help testing the low energy string theory in comparison with the einstein - maxwell theory and will also show the role of the total mass parameter ( calculated in this paper ) on gravitational lensing phenomena .",
