    "this note is a continuation of the study of the jacobian of nonorientable , compact klein surfaces that we started in @xcite . to explain our results we need to recall the set - up in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a nonorientable , connected compact klein surface ( the changes of coordinates in @xmath0 are either holomorphic or anti - holomorphic ) , and let @xmath1 be the canonical double cover of @xmath0 given by local orientations .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath1 is a riemann surface . the nontrivial deck transformation , which we will denote by @xmath2 , for covering @xmath3 is an anti - holomorphic involution on @xmath1 with @xmath0 as the quotient .",
    "the jacobian of @xmath1 was considered in @xcite from three different points of view : ( 1 )  as the dual of the space of holomorphic @xmath4-forms , ( 2 )  as the divisor class group , and ( 3 )  as the group of isomorphism classes of degree zero line bundles . in each case",
    ", the involution @xmath2 induces an involution in the corresponding description of the jacobian . in theorem 4.2 of @xcite",
    "it was stated that the jacobian of @xmath0 can be identified with the set of line bundles @xmath5 such that @xmath6 is holomorphically isomorphic to @xmath5 . however , the proof of that result is not correct",
    ". it was asserted in the proof that the isomorphism of @xmath5 given by @xmath7 can be so chosen that it is an involution of the total space of @xmath5 . in this note",
    "we show that the isomorphism can be chosen to be of order four , and there may not be any isomorphism of order two .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the group of line bundles @xmath5 over @xmath1 such that @xmath6 is holomorphically isomorphic to @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the subgroup defined by all @xmath5 such that the isomorphism of @xmath5 with @xmath6 can be chosen to be an involution of the total space of @xmath5 .",
    "the correct version of theorem 4.2 of @xcite is as follows :    the image of the homomorphism @xmath10 in p.  @xmath11 , eq .",

    "if the genus of @xmath1 is odd , then the image of @xmath10 is a subgroup of @xmath14 of index two .",
    "this theorem is proved in   1 . in    2 and 3 we considered two other approaches to the jacobian mentioned above ( dual space to the space of holomorphic forms and divisors ) and proved this result in those settings .",
    "thus we get three different ( but clearly equivalent ) proofs of the theorem , which shows that one can consider any of these three ways of describing the jacobian of @xmath1 to study the jacobian of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact connected riemann surface equipped with a fixed - point free anti - holomorphic involution @xmath2 .",
    "so @xmath15 is a diffeomorphism with the property that if @xmath16 is the almost complex structure on @xmath1 , then @xmath17 .",

    "next we observe that the tensor product of two homomorphisms @xmath31 is an automorphism of the holomorphic line bundle @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , @xmath32 sends the line bundle @xmath5 to @xmath6 and @xmath33 sends @xmath6 to @xmath34 .",

    "in proposition  3.1 of @xcite we showed that if @xmath122 is a canonical ( symplectic ) basis of @xmath121 satisfying @xmath123 then the associated basis of holomorphic form , @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) is invariant , that is , @xmath126 . here",

    "let @xmath129 be the natural projection , and let @xmath130 denote the involution induced by @xmath2 on @xmath119 .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the lift of @xmath130 to @xmath131 , with the above basis , is given by conjugation .",
    "the fixed points of @xmath130 are therefore given by the solutions of the equation @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the period matrix and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are points in @xmath136 .",
    "we obtain the solutions to this equation in two different ways , depending on whether the genus of @xmath1 is even or odd .",
    "let us first fix some notation .",
    "let @xmath137 denote the @xmath138 identity matrix , and @xmath139 the @xmath138 matrix with entries equal to @xmath4 in the anti - diagonal and @xmath140 in all other entries .",
    "assume first that @xmath1 has even genus .",
    "the fundamental group of the klein surface @xmath0 has one relation given by @xmath141 , from which we get , by a simple topological argument ( see @xcite ) , a symplectic basis of @xmath1 , say @xmath142 .",
    "it is easy to see that the action of @xmath127 on @xmath121 with respect to @xmath142 is given by the matrix @xmath143 .",

    "let @xmath133 denote the period matrix with respect to this new basis of @xmath121 and the associated basis of holomorphic forms ; denote by @xmath152 its entries .",
    "let @xmath153 be the @xmath154 matrix given by @xmath155 and denote by @xmath156 the entries of @xmath153 .",
    "then we have @xmath157 so the real part of @xmath133 is equal to @xmath158 .    since the imaginary part of @xmath133 is invertible",
    "( see for example proposition iii.2.8 of @xcite ) , we have that any point @xmath69 of @xmath131 can be written as @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are points in @xmath162 .",
    "considering the real and imaginary parts of we obtain the following two equations : @xmath163 -(\\hbox{im}\\,p ) y   & = ( \\hbox{im}\\,p)y + ( \\hbox{im}\\,p)m . \\end{cases}\\ ] ] from the first equation , using the expression of @xmath164 obtained above and the fact that all entries of @xmath134 are integers we get that the entries of @xmath135 are even integers . since @xmath165 is invertible , the second equation gives @xmath166 , which implies that @xmath161 has integer entries .",
    "the set of fixed points of @xmath130 is therefore given by the projection of @xmath167 to @xmath119 .    the odd genus case is handled in a similar way ( although the computations are a little more complicated ) : using topological arguments we get a symplectic basis @xmath142 of @xmath121 ; the action of @xmath127 with respect to this basis is given by @xmath168 we change basis in @xmath121 to @xmath169 , where @xmath170 one can easily show that @xmath171 is symplectic and satisfies condition .",
    "the period matrix satisfies the identity @xmath172 , where @xmath153 is the matrix @xmath173 .",
    "splitting in its real and imaginary parts as above we obtain the following pairs of equations ( we used again the fact that @xmath165 is invertible ) : @xmath174 from the first equation we get that if @xmath175 then @xmath176 are even integers .",
    "so the set of fixed points of @xmath130 has two components , given by the projections of the following two sets to @xmath119 : @xmath177 \\mathcal t_2 & = t_1 + p\\,\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0 , \\dots , 0\\right)^t = \\mathcal t_1 + \\frac{1}{2}p_1 \\subset \\mathbb c^g.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath178 is the first period .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite where similar results are stated , although with different computations .",
    "the jacobian of @xmath0 can then be identified with the subgroup @xmath179 of @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath180 be the jacobian of @xmath1 given as the divisor class group , that is degree zero divisors quotiented by the principal divisors .",
    "we have a natural involution in @xmath180 defined by @xmath181 ) = [ \\sigma^*(d)]$ ] , where square brackets denote equivalence classes and @xmath128 the natural extension of @xmath2 to divisors .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the involution @xmath182 is equivalent to @xmath130 by  the abel  jacobi map .",
    "a divisor class @xmath183 $ ] is fixed by @xmath182 if @xmath95 is linearly equivalent to @xmath184 ; that is , there exists a holomorphic function @xmath185 such that @xmath186 .",
    "this implies that @xmath187 , so there exists a constant @xmath25 such that @xmath188 ( here @xmath189 denotes multiplication of complex numbers ) .",
    "but then @xmath190 , so @xmath25 is a real number .",
    "multiplying @xmath73 by a number we can assume that @xmath191 .    if @xmath192 , let @xmath193 be the function @xmath194 .",
    "then @xmath195 so that @xmath196 , which implies @xmath197 . let @xmath198 be the divisor @xmath199 .",
    "then we have that @xmath198 is linearly equivalent to @xmath95 and @xmath200 therefore @xmath95 is linearly equivalent to a divisor ( @xmath198 ) that comes from the surface @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath201 it can be easily seen that @xmath95 is not linearly equivalent to any divisor that comes from @xmath0 .",
    "so we get that the set of fixed points on @xmath182 consists of the following disjoint sets:@xmath202;~\\deg(d ) = 0,~\\sigma^*(d ) = d\\}~\\mathrm{and}~\\\\[.4pc ] \\mathcal t_2 & = \\{[d];~\\deg(d ) = 0,~d-\\sigma^*(d ) = \\hbox{div}(f),~f\\cdot \\overline{f\\circ\\sigma } = 1\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly @xmath203 is not empty .",
    "if @xmath1 has even degree , then by lemma  [ 1lemma1 ] we have that @xmath204 is empty . in the case of odd degree",
    ", let @xmath73 be as in and let @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the divisors defined by the zeroes and poles of @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "equation gives @xmath205 .",
    "again by lemma  [ 1lemma1 ] we have that @xmath76 has even degree .",
    "let @xmath198 be a divisor with @xmath206 and @xmath207 ( observe that this last condition , since @xmath2 does not have fixed points , forces the degree of @xmath198 to be even ) .",
