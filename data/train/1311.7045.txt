    "an object can be characterized by measuring its effect on the amplitude and phase of an electromagnetic wave . for very short wavelengths however , though it is easy to measure the intensity , phase information is usually hard to obtain .",
    "consequently the reconstruction of signals from intensity measurements alone ( also known as _ phase retrieval _ ) is a very important problem in various fields of science and engineering , including x - ray crystallography @xcite , electron microscopy , astronomical imaging @xcite , diffraction imaging , x - ray tomography but also in speech processing @xcite , radar @xcite , signal theory @xcite or quantum tomography @xcite , to mention just a few .",
    "the main problem in phase retrieval arises from the fact that generally the amplitude and phase of a signal are independent . in order to overcome this problem , one may use , for example , prior knowledge about the signal to reconstruct the signal even without any phase measurements @xcite . another method to compensate for the missing phase information is the design of several different measurements of the same object under slightly different conditions",
    "this is a fairly popular and widely - used method in optics and implemented in very different ways , for example , by a distorted - object approach @xcite , by aperture - plane modulations @xcite , or by recording several fractional fourier transforms @xcite of the signal .",
    "however , for a long time there was no systematic approach to design the different measurements such that exact signal recovery could be guaranteed",
    ".    recently some remarkable contributions have been made in this discussion , stimulated mainly by @xcite . in this work",
    ", it was shown that in an @xmath0-dimensional complex vector space , @xmath2 intensity measurements are sufficient for phaseless signal recovery .",
    "it has been conjectured in @xcite that @xmath3 generic intensity measurements are necessary and sufficient for signal recovery , and it was shown in @xcite that @xmath4 measurements are indeed sufficient .",
    "explicit constructions of such measurement vectors were obtained in @xcite , but none of these papers provided a recovery algorithm which is also stable under noisy measurements .",
    "deterministic measurement vectors together with an analytic reconstruction algorithm was obtained in @xcite . however , there the required number of measurements grows proportionally with @xmath5 .",
    "if one requires that only `` almost all '' vectors in @xmath6 can be recovered , then it is known that only @xmath7 measurements are necessary and sufficient @xcite .",
    "however , it was conjectured in @xcite that then phase retrieval is an np - hard problem .",
    "ideas of sparse signal representation and convex optimization were used in @xcite for phase retrieval based on @xmath8 random measurements , where @xmath8 is of the order @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown that the corresponding recovery algorithm , now known as _ phaselift _",
    "@xcite , provides stable recovery under noisy measurements .",
    "this result was improved in @xcite where it was shown that @xmath10 random measurements are sufficient to give a stable signal recovery via convex optimization .",
    "since sdp is computationally costly ( e.g. sdpt3 @xcite needs @xmath11 iterations ) , alternative algorithms for phase retrieval have been proposed which include phasecut @xcite ( @xmath12 ) , alternating minimization @xcite @xmath13 , the fractional fourier transform @xcite and polarization @xcite .",
    "all of the previously mentioned results address finite dimensional signal spaces . for infinite dimensional spaces ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a real valued bandlimited signal can be recovered from magnitude samples taken at twice the nyquist rate .",
    "complex valued @xmath14-signals with finite support are considered in @xcite .",
    "there recovery was guaranteed given specific amplitude measurements taken at four times the nyquist rate .",
    "it provides a reconstruction algorithm which incorporates ideas from finite dimensional spaces and applies structured illuminations @xcite .",
    "this approach was extended to larger signal spaces in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use the measurement design for infinite dimensional signal spaces from @xcite to construct in sec .",

    "if @xmath42 is a solution to the phase retrieval problem then also @xmath43 with @xmath44 is also a solution .",
