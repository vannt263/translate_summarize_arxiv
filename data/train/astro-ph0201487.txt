    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are close binary systems in which a low - mass secondary transfers mass onto a white dwarf ; @xcite wrote an excellent monograph on cvs .",
    "orbital angular momentum losses @xmath5 evidently drive cv evolution . as the orbit shrinks , the secondary star s roche critical lobe contracts , causing mass transfer .",
    "the roche geometry tightly constrains the secondary star s mass at a given orbital period @xmath6 .",
    "short - period systems have low - mass secondaries , so if the chemical composition is normal ( @xmath7 ) , the secondary is faint and contributes negligibly to the visible - light spectrum ( fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "for normal compositions the radius is expected to reach a minimum around 0.05 @xmath8 , leading to a predicted period minimum around 70  75 minutes ( the exact value being dependent on @xmath5 ) , with subsequent evolution driving the system to greater separations @xcite .    during outburst",
    ", short - period dwarf nova systems often show photometric oscillations ( superhumps ) at periods a few percent longer than @xmath6 .",
    "the superhump frequency is thought to be the beat between @xmath6 and a tidally driven precession of an eccentric disk .",
    "the fractional period excess of the superhump appears to be a measure of the mass ratio @xcite .",
    "we recently observed 1rxs j232953.9 + 062814 ( hereafter rx2329 + 06 ) , a newly - recognized dwarf nova system with @xmath6 below the canonical minimum period for hydrogen - rich secondary stars .",
    "our observations reveal an unexpectedly hot secondary star .",
    "we suggest that the secondary has undergone substantial nuclear evolution leading to an enhanced helium abundance .",
    "our optical photometry is from differential ccd measurements , mostly from the center for backyard astrophysics ( cba ) worldwide network of small telescopes @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopy is from the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory on kitt peak .",
    "details of the instrumental setup and reduction were as described in @xcite .",
    "we obtained a total of 77 exposures of 360 s each , on 2001 nov 20 - 22 and 24 ut , spanning 6.0 h of hour angle .",
    "we defer detailed discussion of the outburst photometry for a longer paper . briefly",
    ", the superhump period during outburst was 0.04637(4 ) d , decreasing gradually over the next 10 days to around 0.0458 d.    for astrometry , we obtained several @xmath9-band images with the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at mdm .",
    "we compared these with archival sky - survey data from the usno flagstaff station image and catalogue archive , and found @xmath10 mas yr@xmath3 in p.a .",

    "1 shows the mean low - state spectrum .",
    "broad balmer emission is prominent , along with weaker emission from he i ( table 1 ) .",
    "the balmer lines show double peaks most of the time , separated by @xmath15 km s@xmath3 when the peaks are most distinct .",
    "the continuum has @xmath16 , and the flux level indicates @xmath17 ( estimated uncertainty ) .",
    "the spectrum also shows conspicuous absorption features which appear consistent with a late - type star .",
    "we measured absorption velocities by cross - correlating our spectra against a rest - frame sum of several iau velocity standards , using _",
    "although the absorption was nearly invisible in the individual spectra , the cross - correlation technique succeeded in all cases , giving typical formal errors @xmath18 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a least - squares period search of the absorption velocities @xcite showed a strong , unambiguous period near 64 minutes , and a sine fit ( fig .",
    "2 ) gave the parameters in table 2 .",
    "h@xmath19 emission - line velocities measured using a convolution method sensitive to the line wings @xcite gave noisier velocities ( also in fig .",
    "2 ) , but yielded the same period . fig .",
    "3 shows a greyscale representation of the spectra with phase @xcite .",
    "the absorption spectrum and its modulation are obvious , and the h@xmath19 emission line also shows an apparent @xmath20-wave .    using library spectra from @xcite , we estimate the secondary s spectral type to be k4 @xmath21 subclasses .",
    "earlier spectral types do not show cai @xmath226162 as strongly as rx2329 + 06 , and later types begin to show molecular features which are not present here . assuming the secondary s absorption line strengths are similar to the library spectra",
    ", we estimate that the secondary contributes @xmath23 per cent of the light near 5500  .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 shows phase - averaged white - light differential photometry from the cba network .",
    "the double - peaked modulation is consistent with ellipsoidal variations , which are not unexpected since the secondary contributes so strongly to the total light .",
    "_ distance . _",
    "the secondary spectrum and period constrain the distance . from roche lobe arguments",
    "we infer @xmath24 r@xmath4 ( see below ) , where the uncertainty is conservative since @xmath25 scales as @xmath26 .",
    "k - star surface brightnesses inferred from table 3 of @xcite then imply that the secondary has @xmath27 .",
    "our data give @xmath28 for the secondary alone , where the uncertainty includes the flux calibration and the secondary s relative contribution .",
    "the distance is then 210 ( + 110 , @xmath29 ) pc . at the nominal distance",
    "the transverse velocity is 61 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the quiescent disk at 210 pc has @xmath30 , rising to @xmath31 in outburst , which agrees well with the @xmath32-@xmath6 relation of @xcite .",
    "_ there are no eclipses , so the inclination @xmath33 is uncertain .",
    "the secondary s velocity amplitude gives a mass function of 0.194(6 ) m@xmath4 .",
    "this may be distorted by illumination effects , but we see no evidence of variation of the line features around the spectrum .",
    "the secondary is presumably at least @xmath34 m@xmath4 , which implies a white dwarf mass @xmath35 m@xmath4 , not a particularly stringent constraint . in principle",
    ", the ellipsoidal variations could constrain @xmath33 , but this is sensitive to the assumed limb - darkening parameters @xcite and to the fractional contribution from the secondary .",
    "we tried measuring the emission lines with a range of convolution parameters @xcite , but found a consistent 0.05-cycle phase offset between the emission velocities and the expected phase of the white dwarf motion , so we do not use the emission lines to estimate the mass ratio .",
    "the mass ratio can be estimated from the superhump period excess @xmath36 , using the @xmath37-@xmath38 relationship calibrated by @xcite . at maximum light , @xmath39 , implying @xmath40 , or @xmath41",
    "m@xmath4 for a broadly typical @xmath42 m@xmath4 .",
    "the roche constraint implies @xmath43 at this period @xcite ; combining this with @xmath38 yields @xmath44 .",
    "the illustrative system with @xmath45 m@xmath4 would reproduce the observed mass function at @xmath46 degrees .",
    "it is surprising to find such a hot secondary at this short period , where the secondary mass must be @xmath47 m@xmath4 .",
    "no calculation beginning with a solar - abundance secondary has produced periods this short @xcite , and hydrogen - rich stars of this small a mass would be much cooler than observed .",
    "we suggest that the secondary is substantially enriched in helium , as a result of nuclear evolution prior to mass transfer .",
    "as shown by @xcite , secondary donors which have evolved off the zero age main sequence ( zams ) at the onset of mass transfer can explain a substantial fraction of the observed cvs with late spectral types and @xmath48 h. test calculations with constant mass transfer rates show that significantly evolved donors ( e.g. with mass transfer starting near the end of central h burning ) can be much hotter at a given @xmath49 h than zams donors .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which displays sequences with initial donor mass @xmath50 = 1.2 @xmath51 and starting mass transfer on the zams ( solid line ) or near the end of h burning ( dashed line ) . as already noted by @xcite ,",
    "such extreme sequences never become fully convective , because of the lower central h abundance , and may continue to transfer mass in the 2 - 3 h period gap .",
    "if they sequences do so , they can reach very low orbital periods with unusually high @xmath52 .    for the test case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the evolved sequence ( dashed line ) reaches @xmath6 = 64 min with a mass @xmath53 0.11 @xmath51 and a radius @xmath25 @xmath54 0.13 @xmath55 , in close agreement with the estimates in  3 . we derive a spectral type k5 , based on the empirical spt - @xmath56 relation of beuermann et al ( 1998 ) , again matching observation .",
    "we stress that our spectral type estimate is to be treated with caution , since the surface chemical composition is expected to be non - standard , with a mass fraction of h @xmath54 30 - 40% . because cno - processed material should be visible on the surface , the model has c significantly depleted and n enriched by a factor @xmath54 5 , whereas o is hardly affected .      the emission line fluxes ( table 1 ) suggest that helium is enhanced .",
    "the ratio of h@xmath19 to hei @xmath57 is about 3.6 .",
    "we measured the h@xmath19/@xmath226678 ratio in archival spectra of su uma stars @xcite and found typical values of 8 , with none below 6 .",
    "this could be an excitation effect , but even high - excitation novalikes such as v603 aql @xcite have larger ratios .",
    "the 59-minute binary v485 cen also appears to have an unusually low h@xmath19/@xmath226678 in the spectrum published by @xcite , but absorption features are not evident there . as noted earlier",
    ", the relative cno abundances should be affected , but we can not comment on this since cno elements lack strong lines at this @xmath52 .    in sum , rx2329 is a cv in which the secondary evidently has undergone significant nuclear burning and then had much of its mass stripped away , since at its present mass , its nuclear evolution timescale greatly exceeds the hubble time . if the white dwarf mass is similar to most cvs ( @xmath58 m@xmath4 ) , much of the mass lost by the secondary appears to have been lost from the system .",
    "evidently the system formed with a secondary considerably more massive than the white dwarf . in principle",
    "this leads to mass transfer on a thermal timescale , until @xmath50 becomes small enough for the system to reappear as a standard cv ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",

    "we gratefully acknowledge funding by the nsf ( ast 9987334 ) , and we thank the mdm staff for their excellent support .",
    "special thanks go to the cba observers who contributed to the photometry , including dave skillman , arto oksanen , ed beshore , and tonny vanmunster ; a fuller report on their work will be forthcoming .",
