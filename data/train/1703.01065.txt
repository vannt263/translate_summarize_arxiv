    "interest is surging on vehicular networks and internet - of - vehicles technologies due to their increasingly important role in improving road traffic efficiency , enhancing road safety and providing real - time information to drivers and passengers @xcite . by deploying wireless communication infrastructure along the roadside ( e.g. , road - side units ( rsu ) ) , equipping vehicles with on - board communication facilities ( e.g. , on - board units ( obu ) ) , and with the assistance of dedicated short - range communication ( dsrc ) @xcite and lte technology , two wireless communication modes : vehicle - to - infrastructure and vehicle - to - vehicle communications ,",
    "are supported in vehicular networks . through wireless communications ,",
    "messages can be disseminated for vehicular network applications , including safety applications requiring real - time information about traffic accidents , traffic congestion or obstacles in the road , and non - safety applications such as offering value - added services ( e.g. , digital maps with real - time traffic status ) and in - car entertainment services @xcite .",
    "coming together with the convenience and advantage of wireless communications is the potential security threat that vehicular networks may present to transportation systems .",
    "different from traditional security settings , in vehicular networks , information collection and dissemination are conducted by distributed vehicles .",
    "quite often , information may be generated by or received from a vehicle that has never been encountered before .",
    "this may render traditional security mechanisms , largely based on cryptography and key management , or trust management , futile in vehicular networks .",
    "the situation is further exacerbated by the highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks where the connections may emerge opportunistically between vehicles and the associated network topology is constantly changing @xcite .",
    "all these features of vehicular networks pose unique challenges for vehicular network security and make vehicular networks prone to attacks by malicious and/or selfish attackers who may spread false messages , tamper or drop the received messages .",
    "these security threats are likely to result in severe consequences like traffic congestion , traffic crash , even loss of lives and must be thoroughly investigated before vehicular networks can be deployed .    in this paper , we study information security of vehicular ad hoc networks ( vanets ) , where the message may be tampered by malicious vehicles randomly distributed in the network , by investigating the probability that a destination vehicle at a fixed distance away can receive the message correctly from the source vehicle . specifically , consider that a vehicle ( i.e. , the source vehicle ) detecting an abnormal situation , e.g. , traffic accident , slippery road and congestion , sends a message informing other vehicles of the situation .",
    "the message is forwarded from the source vehicle in a multi - hop manner to other vehicles .",
    "we analyze the probability that a vehicle at a fixed distance away , termed the destination vehicle , can receive the message correctly from the source vehicle in the presence of malicious vehicles in between , which may modify the transmitted message .",
    "the novelty and major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we develop for the first time an analytical framework to model the process of message dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks in the presence of malicious vehicles randomly distributed in the network . the probability that a message is delivered correctly from the source vehicle to a destination vehicle at a fixed distance away is analyzed .",
    "simulations are conducted to establish the accuracy of the analysis .",
    "using the analysis , relationship is revealed between key parameters such as the probability of correct message reception and its major performance - impacting parameters .",
    "discussions are presented on the impact of network topology and the distribution of malicious vehicles on secure message delivery in vehicular networks .",
    "our results may provide insight on the design of security mechanisms , particularly secure routing algorithms and topology control algorithms , to improve informations security in vehicular networks .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : related - work ] reviews related work . section [ sec : system - model - and ] introduces the system model and the problem formation .",
    "theoretical analysis is presented in section [ sec : theoretical - analysis ] . in section [ sec : simulation - and - discussion ] , we conduct simulations to validate the accuracy of our analysis and discuss its insight . section [ sec : conclusion - and - future ] concludes this paper .",
    "for secure message dissemination in vehicular networks , two major factors need to be considered : the trustworthiness of each vehicle and the integrity of the transmitted message . accordingly",
    ", three misbehavior detection schemes are commonly adopted for secure message dissemination : entity - centric misbehavior detection scheme , data - centric misbehavior detection scheme , and a combined use of both . in the following , we will review the works on these three schemes separately .",
    "entity - centric misbehavior detection schemes focus on assessing the trustworthiness level of each vehicle to filter out the malicious vehicles .",
    "the assessment process is commonly conducted at each vehicle by monitoring their instantaneous neighbors behavior . in @xcite ,",
    "gazdar et al . proposed a dynamic and distributed trust model to formalize a trust relationship between vehicles and filter out malicious and selfish vehicles .",
    "their trust model is based on the use of a markov chain to evaluate the evolution of the trust value . in @xcite , instead of allowing all vehicles to assess trustworthiness , khan et al . proposed a novel malicious node detection algorithm for vanets , which optimizes the selection of assessors to improve the overall network performance . in @xcite ,",
    "haddadou et al .",
    "proposed a distributed trust model for vanets , which was motivated by the job market signaling model .",
    "their trust model is able to gradually detect all malicious nodes as well as boosting the cooperation of selfish nodes . in @xcite , to overcome the challenges of intermittent and ad hoc monitoring and assessment processes caused by the high mobility and rapid topology change in vehicular networks , sedjelmaci et al .",
    "proposed a lightweight intrusion detection framework with the help of a clustering algorithm , where nodes are grouped into highly stable clusters so that the monitoring and assessment processes can be better conducted in a relatively stable environment .",
    "data - centric misbehavior detection schemes focus on the consistency check of the disseminated data to filter out the false data . in @xcite ,",
    "dietzel et al . argued that redundant data forwarding paths are the most promising technique for effective data consistency check in a multi - hop information dissemination environment , and proposed three graph - theoretic metrics to measure the redundancy of dissemination protocols . in @xcite ,",
    "raya et al . proposed a framework for vehicular networks to establish data - centric trust , and evaluated the effectiveness of four data fusion rules : majority voting , weighted voting , bayesian inference and belief propagation based techniques . in @xcite , huang et al .",
    "firstly demonstrated that information cascading and oversampling adversely affect the performance of trust management scheme in vanets , and then proposed a novel voting scheme that taking the distance between the transmitter and receiver into account when assigning weight to the trust level of the received data . in @xcite , zaidi",
    "proposed and evaluated a rogue node detection system for vanets using statistical techniques to determine whether the received data are false . in @xcite , radak applied a so - called cautious operator to deal with data received from different sources to detect dangerous events on the road .",
    "their adopted cautious operator is an extension of the demper - shafer theory that is known to be superior in handling data come from dependent sources .",
    "a combined use of entity - centric and data - centric misbehavior detection scheme makes use of both the trust level of vehicles and the consistency of received data to detect misbehaving vehicles and filter out incorrect messages",
    ". works adopting the combined scheme are limited . in @xcite , dhurandher proposed a security algorithm using both node reputation and data plausibility checks to protect the network against attacks .",
    "the reputation value is obtained by both direct monitoring and indirect recommendation from neighbors ; and the data consistency check is conducted by comparing the received data with the sensed data by the vehicle s own sensors . in @xcite , li et al .",
    "proposed an attack - resistant trust management scheme to evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and vehicles in vanets , and to detect and cope with malicious attacks .",
    "they adopted the dempster - shafer theory to combine the data received from different sources , and then used this combined result to update the trust value of vehicles .    in summary ,",
    "all the above works on security issues in vehicular networks focused on trust model establishment , trust model management , or methods to assess data from different sources to check their consistency , with a goal of detecting misbehaving nodes in the network .",
    "our work is different from theirs in that we focus on theoretically characterizing the probability of correct message reception , and evaluate the impact of network topology and distribution of malicious vehicles on the probability .",
    "we consider a vehicular ad hoc network on a highway with bi - directional traffic flows .",
    "vehicles in both directions are distributed randomly following poisson point processes @xcite with spatial densities @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively",
    ". as a ready consequence of the superposition property of poisson processes @xcite , all vehicles on the highway are also poissonly distributed with density @xmath2 . in actual road networks",
    ", there may be multiple lanes in each direction .",
    "considering that the width of a lane is typically small compared with the transmission range of vehicles , we ignore the road width and model multiple lanes in the same direction as one lane @xcite .",
    "we consider a general wireless connection model @xcite , where a receiver separated by a euclidean distance @xmath3 from a transmitter receives the message successfully with a probability @xmath4 , independent of transmissions by other transmitter - receiver pairs .",
    "there are two constraints on @xmath4 : 1 ) it is a monotonic non - increasing function of @xmath3 and 2 ) @xmath5 .",
    "this general wireless connection model includes a number of widely - used wireless connection models as its special cases .",
    "for instance , when @xmath4 assumes the following form    @xmath6    it becomes the widely known unit disk model where a pair of wireless nodes are directly connected when their euclidean distance is smaller than or equal to a threshold @xmath7 , known as the transmission range .",
    "alternatively , when @xmath4 takes the following form ,    @xmath8    it becomes another widely known log - normal connection model @xcite , where @xmath9 is the path loss exponent , @xmath10 is the standard deviation and @xmath7 is the equivalent transmission range when @xmath11 .",
    "we consider a network with a sufficiently large vehicular density such that the generated vehicular network is a connected network @xcite .",
    "besides , broadcast transmission is adopted so that each message can be received by multiple vehicles to increase the number of redundant data forwarding paths and reduce the message dissemination time .",
    "furthermore , we assume that time is divided into time slots of equal length @xmath12 and @xmath13 is sufficiently small such that we can regard vehicles as almost stationary during each time slot .",
    "after the message dissemination process begins , at each time slot , a vehicle among the set of vehicles that 1 ) have received at least one message and 2 ) are yet to transmit the message , is randomly chosen to broadcast its received message .",
    "such broadcast protocol can be readily implemented in a distributed manner by having each vehicle waits a random amount of time identically and independently distributed following an exponential distribution before transmitting its received message .",
    "each vehicle only transmits its received message once .",
    "note that the radio propagation speed is much faster than the moving speed of vehicles @xcite .",
    "therefore , we ignore the information propagation delay in this paper and assume that during the message dissemination process , the topology of the vehicular network remains unchanged .",
    "we assume that vehicles along the highway can be classified into two categories : _ normal vehicles , _ which behave normally and will forward the received message without any alteration , and _ malicious vehicles , _ _ _ which _ _ _ _ may tamper the received message and alter its content . beside , we assume that the probability of each vehicle being a malicious vehicle is @xmath14 , independent of the event that another distinct vehicle is a malicious vehicle .",
    "we further assume that the malicious vehicles act in a distributed manner and there is no central coordination among malicious vehicles . as a consequence of the assumption",
    ", each malicious vehicle simply modifies the received message without evaluation of the true content of the message .    following the broadcast dissemination scheme considered in the paper , each vehicle is likely to receive multiple copies of a message from different vehicles before it broadcasts the message . due to the existence of malicious vehicles",
    ", the received messages may not be the same .",
    "for example , one vehicle may detect a traffic incident and generate a message alerting other vehicles but this message may be modified by a malicious vehicle . in the situation of",
    "conflicting messages being received , a _ majority voting _",
    "rule is employed by each vehicle to fuse their received messages .",
    "that is , the normal vehicle will broadcast the message in agreement with the most number of vehicles and discard the message conflicting with majority opinion , and the malicious vehicle will broadcast the message conflicting with the majority opinion .",
    "when a tie occurs , all the vehicles will randomly choose one of the two messages ( true or false message ) with equal probability to broadcast .",
    "the simplicity of the majority voting rule allows us to      given the aforementioned background , we are now ready to give a formal definition of the problem considered in this paper .",
    "consider a vehicle , termed the source vehicle @xmath15 , detects an accident in front of it and wants to deliver a warning message to vehicles traveling in the same direction as @xmath15 and behind @xmath15 in that direction .",
    "designate the location of @xmath15 at the time instant when it broadcasts the message as the origin , and the direction of information propagation ( in the opposite direction of the travel direction of @xmath15 ) as the positive direction .",
    "we want to investigate the probability that a vehicle , termed the destination vehicle @xmath16 , located at distance @xmath17 away from @xmath15 can receive the message of @xmath15 correctly .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the sub - network we focus on , which is within the road segment @xmath19 , and with vehicular density @xmath20 and a wireless connection model @xmath21 .",
    "[ fig : system model ] for an illustration .     and",
    "ends at the location of destination vehicle @xmath16.[fig : system model ] , width=321 ]    two kinds of messages are considered in this paper , @xmath22 represents the true message ( e.g. , road is congested ) and @xmath23 represents the false message ( e.g. , road is not congested ) .",
    "here we assume that the source vehicle @xmath15 is a normal vehicle , namely , the message broadcast by the source vehicle @xmath15 is true .",
    "for malicious vehicles , as there are no central coordination among them , there is no way for a malicious vehicle to know the true content of the message .",
    "therefore , it is assumed that a malicious vehicle simply modify the content of whatever message it receives ( against the outcome of the majority voting rule ) , i.e. , changing @xmath22 to @xmath23 and @xmath23 to @xmath22 .",
    "finally , the destination vehicle @xmath16 conducts its majority voting process after it has received all messages , or equivalently after no further message is received after a long time period .",
    "denote by @xmath24 the concluded message after @xmath16 has completed its data fusion . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in investigating the probability that the destination vehicle @xmath16 receives the correct message , denoted by @xmath25 , which can be expressed as follows : @xmath26",
    "in this section , we will present our analysis on the probability that the destination vehicle receives the message correctly .    from the definition of the probability of correct message reception , which is given in ,",
    "@xmath25 can be expressed as follows as an easy consequence of the total probability theorem : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the random number of vehicles located in the sub - network @xmath18 . due to the poisson distribution of vehicles , we have @xmath29    recall that in our system , the source vehicle @xmath15 located at the origin broadcasts its message first . after that , at each time slot , a vehicle among the set of vehicles having received at least one message _ and _ having not broadcast its message is randomly chosen to broadcast .",
    "denote by @xmath30 the @xmath31th vehicle that broadcasts the message and denote its location by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a random variable representing the location of the @xmath31th vehicle broadcasting its message .",
    "we designate the source vehicle @xmath15 as the @xmath34th broadcast vehicle and its location is @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that the destination vehicle @xmath16 then becomes the @xmath36th broadcast vehicle . using the total probability theorem , the conditional probability that the destination vehicle @xmath16 receives the correct message ( after its fusion ) , given there are",

    "it follows that @xmath53 as we regard the source vehicle @xmath15 is a normal vehicle that broadcasts the true message , and each @xmath54 is a binary random variable taking value from @xmath55 . assuming the majority voting rule , the conditional probability that the destination vehicle @xmath16 receives the message correctly given that the @xmath31th broadcast vehicle is located at @xmath51 , @xmath56 , can be calculated by : @xmath57\\nonumber \\\\   & + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2^{n+1}}\\left[\\pr\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n}m_{i}h^{j}(y_{i})=0\\right)\\pr\\left(\\mathbf{h = h}^{j}\\right)\\right]\\nonumber \\\\ = & \\sum_{j=1}^{2^{n+1}}\\biggl\\{\\pr\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n}m_{i}h^{j}(y_{i})>0\\right)\\times\\nonumber \\\\   & \\left[\\prod_{i=0}^{n}\\left[g\\left(l - y_{i}\\right)h^{j}(y_{i})+\\left(1-g\\left(l - y_{i}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-h^{j}(y_{i})\\right)\\right]\\right]\\biggr\\}\\nonumber \\\\   & + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2^{n+1}}\\biggl\\{\\pr\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n}m_{i}h^{j}(y_{i})=0\\right)\\times\\nonumber \\\\   & \\left[\\prod_{i=0}^{n}\\left[g\\left(l - y_{i}\\right)h^{j}(y_{i})+\\left(1-g\\left(l - y_{i}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-h^{j}(y_{i})\\right)\\right]\\right]\\biggr\\}\\label{eq : cal of psuc given each yi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 , and the first step follows from the rule of majority voting , particularly noting that when a tie occurs , the destination vehicle will make a decision randomly with equal probability .",
