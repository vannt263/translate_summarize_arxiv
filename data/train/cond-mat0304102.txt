    "as it is well - known , the dynamics of a small josephson tunnel junction is characterized by two energies : the josephson coupling energy @xmath2 and the charging energy @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the junction is determined by the competition between these two energy scales . if the josephson coupling energy dominates , a superconducting state with a well - defined phase difference @xmath4 across the junction is possible .",
    "the junction will carry a cooper pair current @xmath5 in the absence of an external voltage @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the josephson critical current ( @xmath7 is the electron charge ) .",
    "if on the other hand the charging energy dominates , an insulating state with a well - defined charge @xmath8 on the junction is possible .",
    "this gives rise to a gap in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics of the junction , associated to coulomb blockade  @xcite : the cooper pair current @xmath9 up to a voltage @xmath10 .",
    "here we defined @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the capacitance of the junction .",
    "the above statements are true under appropriate conditions on the impedance @xmath13 of the circuit connected to the junction , as we will discuss in some detail below . to be specific",
    ", we will consider two configurations . the voltage - biased set - up , in fig .",
    "[ setup]a , consists of an ideal voltage source ( voltage @xmath14 ) , connected to a series arrangement of a josephson junction and a resistance @xmath15 . in a current - biased set - up , see fig .",
    "[ setup]b , an ideal current source ( bias current @xmath16 ) is connected to a parallel arrangement of a josephson junction and a shunt resistance @xmath15 .",
    "the two set - ups are equivalent if we choose @xmath17  @xcite . the resistance @xmath15 plays a crucial role and determines the detailed form of the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics .",
    "in particular , the way in which the transition from superconducting to insulating behavior of the junction manifests itself in the current - voltage characteristic depends not only on the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but also on @xmath15 .",
    "the voltage biased set - up , fig .",
    "[ setup]a , has been analyzed long ago by ivanchenko and zilberman  @xcite in the limit of strong charging effects , @xmath18 .",
    "more recently , a perturbative approach has been developed to obtain the current - voltage characteristic  @xcite .",
    "this approach is valid for finite , but small , values of @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , in the zero temperature limit @xmath20 , a change of the position of the supercurrent peak is found upon increasing the ratio @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the supercurrent peak is centered at zero bias voltage ; its width increases gradually as @xmath21 is increased .",
    "if @xmath24 , the supercurrent peak is centered around @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to the transition from superconducting behavior found for small values of the external resistance to a complete coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunneling in the presence of a resistive environment .",
    "the range of applicability of the perturbative analysis depends on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath15 . in the low resistance limit @xmath23 , the approach breaks down at low energy ( bias voltage or temperature ) for any value of @xmath2 . in the opposite limit @xmath26 , the condition @xmath27 needs to be satisfied .",
    "a non - perturbative analysis was developed in  @xcite , however its validity is limited to low energies , @xmath28 .",
    "the approach discussed so far is clearly appropriate if one is interested in a small junction with @xmath29 , coupled to an environment which is not too resistive .",
    "an example is the recent experiment by steinbach _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of refs .",
    "however , the perturbative approach is not applicable in the case of a josephson junction with @xmath30 , coupled to a strongly resistive environment , @xmath31 , usually referred to as the underdamped limit  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless this is a relevant situation from an experimental point of view as well .",
    "recently , watanabe and haviland measured the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics of a small josephson junction coupled to a tunable environment  @xcite . in these experiments , @xmath32 and the environment",
    "could be tuned to large values of the resistance such that @xmath33  @xmath34 .",
    "no evidence of a supercurrent peak was observed ; rather a so - called bloch nose  @xcite was found for small values of the current and the bias voltage .",
    "this corresponds to an on - set of coulomb blockade at low voltage and small current , followed by subsequent back - bending of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve to smaller values of the voltage at higher currents which indicates a cross - over to superconducting behavior .",
    "the shape of the bloch nose depended on the resistance @xmath15 as well as on temperature .",
    "the experimental findings could not be reconciled quantitatively with existing theories of bloch nose  @xcite .",
    "the main problem is that those theories are essentially based on the presence of dissipation due to quasiparticles . in the experiment",
    "@xcite , the tunable environment is a long array of superconducting junctions in the insulating regime  @xcite , and quasiparticles are practically absent .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the finite temperature behavior of a josephson junction with @xmath35 , coupled to a very resistive environment , in the absence of quasiparticles .",

    "the eigenstates of the junction are of the bloch type , and the energy spectrum consists of bands of width of the order @xmath3 , separated by gaps of the order @xmath2 . in the limit @xmath35 , the gaps are large and the junction stays in the lowest bloch band at low temperature @xmath36 , as long as the bias current @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath38 , bloch oscillations  @xcite of the voltage @xmath1 occur , such that its time - averaged value vanishes : the junction is in the superconducting state .",
    "if @xmath15 is finite , relaxation within the lowest band modifies the dynamics of the junction .",
    "this results in the appearance of the bloch nose : if @xmath16 is so small that relaxation prevents bloch oscillations to occur , a finite voltage state develops with no current passing through the junction ( coulomb blockade ) , all current passes through the resistance .",
    "if @xmath16 is increased above a threshold value , bloch oscillations develop and the a superconducting zero - voltage state is reached .",
