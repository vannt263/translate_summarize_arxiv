    "tight binding models , such as the hubbard hamiltonian , have been widely studied for their ability to describe different kinds of insulating phases present in condensed matter systems .",
    "interactions between fermions give rise to gapped mott insulators where the fermions are immobile at commensurate fillings .",
    "for bipartite lattices , mott behavior is typically associated with antiferromagnetic order . on the other hand ,",
    "the imposition of an external periodic potential can drive band insulating behavior . in systems where several types of insulating effects are present",
    ", phase transitions can take place as the relative strength of the parameters is changed .",
    "close to such transitions , the competition between these different terms allows smaller effects , such as kinetic energies , to result in low temperature metallic phases or more exotic types of correlations such as bond - order .",
    "such compensating effects are believed to explain enhanced response in different quasi - one - dimensional systems such as organic materials @xcite , ferroelectric perovskites @xcite or transition metal - oxides @xcite .",
    "a simple model exhibiting this kind of behavior is the ionic hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , a tight binding model that includes an on - site repulsion and a staggered potential that takes alternating values on neighboring sites of a bipartite lattice . at half - filling",
    ", the on - site repulsion drives the system into an antiferromagnetic mott insulator ( mi ) , with a homogeneous density . when the staggered potential dominates , a band insulator ( bi ) with a regular modulation of the density results .",
    "a quantum phase transition between these two states occurs in the phase diagram .    in one dimension",
    ", the ionic hubbard model has been widely studied through a variety of techniques including density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , exact diagonalization , bosonization and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) with on - site @xcite or extended @xcite interactions .",
    "the precise conclusions are still subject to some debate , but many of the studies suggest that the direct transition from the band insulator to the mott insulator is replaced by an intervening insulating bond - ordered phase . in two dimensions , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite , cluster - dmft@xcite and determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) @xcite were used . the existence of an intermediate phase between the bi and mi phases has been established , as in one dimension , but the precise nature of the phase is still under debate ( see section ii ) .",
    "studies of a bilayer hubbard model @xcite and in infinite dimension @xcite yield similar results with a low temperature metal as the intermediate phase . here the interplanar coupling , if sufficiently large , gives a noninteracting band structure with a gap at half - filling much like a staggered potential .",
    "a recent experiment attempts to observe this kind of phase @xcite .",
    "a related problem is the study of heterostructures of srtio@xmath0 and latio@xmath0 , one being a mi , the other a bi and a metallic phase appearing at the interface between the two @xcite .",
    "some of the phenomena presented here also have similarities with those found in corresponding disordered models used to describe binary alloys @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we consider the different phases and transitions of the ionic hubbard hamiltonian on a two - dimensional square lattice using determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) , extending our initial study@xcite . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and summarize our previous results . in section iii , we briefly describe the numerical techniques used while in section iv , we investigate further the different phases by measuring the charge and magnetic structure factors and the spectral function .",
    "we then present an analysis of the properties away from half filling ( section v ) and the search for bond - order waves ( section vi ) .",
    "conclusions are in section vii .",
    "we consider the ionic hubbard model    @xmath1 ( n_{{\\bf r } \\uparrow } + n_{{\\bf r } \\downarrow } ) \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 are the usual fermion creation ( destruction ) operators on site @xmath3 of a two - dimensional square lattice with spin @xmath4 and where @xmath5 is the number operator .",
    "the hopping parameter , @xmath6 , sets the energy scale and is fixed at a value of @xmath7 , while tuning the chemical potential @xmath8 gives the desired fermion filling .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath9 and staggered potential @xmath10 are the two competing terms of our system , the former encouraging single occupancy of all sites and the latter double occupancy of the low energy sublattice.@xcite    considering the limiting cases @xmath11 and @xmath12 we find two distinct insulating phases at half - filling ( density @xmath13 ) . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the usual translationally invariant hubbard model arises and , at @xmath15 , forms an antiferromagnetic mott insulator at half - filling for any value of @xmath9 . at strong coupling ,",
    "the gap is set by @xmath9 , while the effective anti - ferromagnetic coupling is set by @xmath16 .",
    "these two energy scales are evident in the magnetic properties where @xmath17 demarks the onset of moment formation on individual sites and @xmath18 , the onset of antiferromagnetic order between sites . in the non interacting limit @xmath19",
    ", the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in fourier space ( where it reduces to a set of independent @xmath20 matrices ) @xmath21 where the sum runs over half the brillouin zone and where @xmath22 is the energy of a free particle of wave vector @xmath23 .",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath24 are then split into two bands separated by a gap @xmath25 and , in this limit , the system is a band insulator at half - filling .",
    "these two insulating phases can be seen schematically in fig .",
    "[ schem ] .",
    "recently , it was shown@xcite that there is no direct transition between these two insulating phases , but that an intermediate phase appears ( fig .",
    "the precise nature of the phase is still being debated . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we used the determinant quantum monte carlo algorithm ( dqmc ) to study the conductivity of the model . performing a finite size and temperature analysis",
    ", we concluded that the intermediate phase has a finite conductivity and is , consequently , metallic .",
    "_ arrive at the same conclusion in their dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) study@xcite while using a cluster - dmft analysis , kancharla _ et al .",
    "_ argue for a bond ordered wave ( bow ) phase @xcite .",
    "dqmc@xcite is a numerical approach which expresses the partition function @xmath26 as a path integral where the inverse temperature @xmath27 is discretized .",
    "the interaction term is decoupled via a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation , introducing a sum over an ising spin field and leaving the hamiltonian in a quadratic form with respect to the fermion operators .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom can then be integrated out and the remaining boltzmann weight is expressed as the determinant of the product of two matrices that depend on the hs spin variables . in the conventional hubbard model ,",
    "this determinant is positive at half - filling , due to particle - hole symmetry . with the staggered potential ,",
    "the determinant is no longer always positive at half - filling resulting in a sign problem which can be severe .",
    "the remaining sum over the hs field and the evaluation of observables is achieved by a metropolis monte carlo algorithm .",
    "it is difficult to obtain good estimates for the observables when the determinant is often negative , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the mean value of the sign of the determinant is small .",
    "this problem is important for intermediate values of @xmath9 and @xmath25 , while it is not severe in the limiting cases where we retrieve simple bi or mi phases ( @xmath9 or @xmath25 small or large ) .    with this formulation , space and (",
    "imaginary-)time separated green functions @xmath28 are easily expressed as elements of the matrices .",

    "we measure correlation functions for charge and spin density waves ( cdw and sdw , respectively ) , given by @xmath32 \\left[n_{{\\bf r } \\uparrow}\\pm n_{{\\bf r } \\downarrow}\\right]\\right\\rangle\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath33 corresponds to cdw and @xmath34 to sdw .",
    "the staggered potential imposes a checkerboard modulation on the density , not only in the bi phase but in all phases as it breaks explicitly the translational invariance .",
    "antiferromagnetic magnetic correlations are also expected in the mi phase .",
    "thus , for both types of correlations , we expect ordering with a wave vector @xmath35 , characterized by the divergence of corresponding structure factors @xmath36",

    "in contrast , the spectral function for @xmath44 is non zero and shows a quasi - particle peak at @xmath43 which indicates metallic behavior .    these results are consistent with measurements of the conductivity in our previous article , as is confirmed by the direct comparison of the spectral function at zero frequency @xmath45 and the conductivity @xmath46 shown in fig .  [ specvsu ] . for @xmath47 and as @xmath9",
    "is increased , the behaviors of these two quantities are similar : they both show , for intermediate values of @xmath9 , a peak that grows with @xmath27 .",
    "the ranges of interaction where there are peaks are slightly different because of finite size effects .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are the critical repulsion energies that cause bi to metal and metal to mi phase transitions for a fixed value of @xmath25 .",
    "these critical values are obtained by a finite temperature analysis of the conductivity@xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the conductivity increases in a metal and decreases in an insulator . locating the points where the behavior of the conductivity changes gives the critical values . for @xmath47 ,",

    "as @xmath9 is increased , @xmath52 increases as the system is driven towards the mi phase , while @xmath53 decreases , in moving away from the bi phase .",
    "the transitions in these quantities when we cross the phase boundaries are not sharp on lattices of fixed , finite size owing to finite size rounding effects .",
    "in addition , as stated above , a smoother evolution is expected for @xmath53 as a modulation of @xmath57 is imposed by the external potential for all parameter values .    in a conventional hubbard model ,",
    "the mi at half filling is always an antiferromagnet .",
    "however , it has been suggested recently for related models @xcite that the metal - mi and para- to antiferro - magnetic ( pm - af ) transitions may not take place together . a finite size scaling analysis of @xmath52 for different values of @xmath9 is needed to check whether these two boundaries coincide in our model .",
    "the structure factor @xmath52 increases like the number of sites @xmath58 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "[ finitesizeaf ] shows structure factors for sizes up to @xmath61 sites for different values of @xmath9 .",

    "we apply a least squares fit to the data , and extrapolate to an infinite system .",
    "we find a non - vanishing structure factor only in the mi phase ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) . in all the other cases ,",
    "including points located close to the metal - mi transition ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , the structure factor goes to zero as the size is increased .",
    "the pm - af transition , therefore , takes place between @xmath68 and @xmath64 and appears to be simultaneous with the metal - mi transition .",
    "although our study on limited sizes can not completely exclude completely the possibility of an exotic af metallic phase located around the metal - mi boundary , our data suggest that it does not occur .",

    "both the mi ( @xmath71 ) and bi ( @xmath72 ) phases have this distinctive plateau at half - filling .",
    "the metallic nature of the intermediate phase is once again confirmed by the absence of a plateau around @xmath13 .    using the same parameters @xmath9 and @xmath25",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ structvrho ] the evolution of the structure factors as functions of @xmath57 .",
    "as expected , for the parameters corresponding to the mi at @xmath13 , @xmath52 shows a strong peak around half - filling indicating the presence of the af - mi in this case and its rapid suppression upon doping . in this case",
    ", charge correlations always remain small , as double occupancy of sites is essentially forbidden .",
    "similarly , for the parameters corresponding to the bi , the peak is present in @xmath53 at @xmath13 and @xmath52 remains small for all densities , as the occupation of larger energy site is suppressed . for the metallic case",
    ", there is no peak in the magnetic structure factor at @xmath13 but a moderate peak in @xmath53 .",
    "in all these three cases , away from half - filling , the structure factors are rapidly suppressed and the system is compressible and becomes a paramagnetic metal .    for stronger interactions and staggered potential ,",
    "other ordered phases can be found at quarter and three quarters fillings . for @xmath42 and @xmath73 ,",
    "there is a band insulator at half - filling shown by the @xmath13 plateau in fig .",
    "[ rhovmu2 ] .",
    "additional plateaux emerge at @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the plateau at @xmath76 corresponds to a state where all the lower energy sites are occupied by one fermion . adding a fermion to an already occupied site increases the energy approximately by @xmath9",
    ", while adding it to an empty ( high energy ) site increases it by @xmath25 .",
    "there is then an energy gap , roughly equal to the smaller of the two parameters ( @xmath9 in this case ) .",
    "we then have a mott insulator at quarter filling and , symetrically , another one at three quarters filling . in the case where @xmath9 is larger than @xmath25 , the situation is reversed and we expect a mi at half - filling and a bi for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( this case is difficult to treat numerically because of a strong sign problem ) .",
    "although the system is incompressible for @xmath76 , there is no concommitant magnetic order : in fig .",
    "[ structvmu ] , @xmath52 always remains small as @xmath57 is varied away from half - filling and there is no af peak around quarter filling ( the maximum being around @xmath78 ) .",
    "the af ordering appears when the fermions jump between neighboring sites , thus creating an effective antiferromagnetic coupling between spins . at quarter filling , the particles are surrounded by empty sites and there is no effective coupling . as for @xmath53 we only observe a peak at half - filling ( fig .  [ structvmu ] ) . a plot of the conductivity ( fig .",
    "[ structvmu](c ) ) versus @xmath57 shows that , indeed , @xmath46 vanishes for @xmath79 and @xmath80 corresponding to the plateaux observed in fig .  [ rhovmu2 ] .",
    "long range bond - ordered waves ( bow ) are known to exist in one dimension in the ionic hubbard model @xcite as well as in other one - dimensional systems exhibiting density modulation such as extended hubbard models @xcite .",
    "( in the latter case , the two numerical treatments , using the stochastic series expansion@xcite and density matrix renormalization group@xcite , disagree on the precise width of the bow phase as well as over what range of coupling values it is present . )",
    "it was suggested by kancharla _",
    "et al._@xcite that the intermediate phase observed at half - filling in the two - dimensional case studied here was in fact a bond - ordered state , as in one dimension .",
    "other studies have attempted to observe bond - order in two dimensions , for example in extended hubbard models @xcite . in two dimensions , bond orders",
    "have mostly been obtained in hamiltonians possessing rather special geometries or interactions , e.g.  on checkerboard lattices @xcite or by including additional terms such as ring exchanges @xcite .",
    "hence , bond order seems in general more difficult to obtain in two dimensions than in one . in our system",
    ", we can understand this with the argument sketched in fig .",
    "[ bowschem ] . starting from a situation where all the particles are located on the low energy sites ( @xmath81 sites ) ,",
    "a jump to a high energy site ( @xmath82 site ) increases the energy roughly by @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath9 are of the same order of magnitude , this energy cost is small and the jump has a high probability to happen .",
    "this @xmath82 site is connected to two @xmath81 sites : the one where the jumping particle comes from ( to the right in fig .",
    "[ bowschem ] ) and another one ( to the left ) still occupied by two particles .",
    "the jumps on the left bond are suppressed : the particle on the @xmath82 site and the particle having the same spin ( an up spin in the sketch ) on the @xmath81 site can not jump because of pauli principle , while a jump of the remaining particle has a large energy cost @xmath25 .    in short , having a particle jumping on a bond ( and thus a contribution to the kinetic energy on this bond ) will inhibit jumps on the following bond . in one dimension , this can lead to a bond order with alternate strong and weak values of the kinetic energy . on a two dimensional square lattice",
    ", the appearance of a strong bond will inhibit the three other bonds linked to the same site and it seems more difficult to generate regular arrays of weak and strong bonds .    to check if there is a bow , we examined the correlation function of the kinetic energy @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the kinetic energy operator connecting sites @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 being a unit vector directed along the @xmath89 direction ) , @xmath90 the fourier transform of @xmath91 always exhibits a very small peak for @xmath92 , in _ _ all the different phases at or away from half - filling .",
    "finite size scaling analysis indicates that these peaks persist in large size lattices , but this is the case for all the different phases , not only in the intermediate phase .",
    "we also studied the bow susceptibility@xcite for this wave vector @xmath93 fig .",
    "[ corrbow ] shows the evolution of @xmath94 at half - filling as a function of @xmath9 and for two different values of @xmath25 .",
    "the curve is maximum in the intermediate phase but is also non zero in other phases .",
    "similar results are obtained for bonds oriented along the @xmath95 direction and for mixed @xmath89-@xmath95 cases .",
    "we do not believe these signals to indicate the presence of a bow phase for the following reasons ( a ) the values obtained are extremely small .",
    "( b ) these `` bow signals '' are ubiquitous in _ all three phases _ and not specific to the intermediate one .",
    "the susceptibility is , for example , nearly as important in the mi phase as in the intermediate phase .",
    "as soon as @xmath9 and @xmath25 are both non - zero , we observe this very weak non - zero value of @xmath94 .",
    "( c ) starting from the metallic phase ( @xmath96 ) and doping away from half - filling the system is certainly known to be metallic ( see fig .  [ corrbow2 ] ) yet the bow susceptibility is non zero and comparable to the value found at half - filling .",
    "for all these reasons , we believe that these tiny signals are only a weak signature of an interplay between the interaction and externally imposed checkerboard potential .",
    "we have extended our previous study of the phase diagram of the ionic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "in addition to new qmc results for the conductivity , we calculated the spectral function , the kinetic energy correlation function ( the order parameter for the bow phase ) and the magnetic and charge order parameters .",
    "our results point to the presence of a normal conducting metallic phase intervening between the band and mott insulating phases .",
    "in particular , we have not found a clear signal in the bow order parameter and susceptibilities indicating the presence of such a phase .",
    "we also studied the system doped away from half filling .",
    "when the band or mott insulating phase is doped , a conducting phase is obtained except at fillings of @xmath97 and @xmath98 where we found insulating phases without magnetic order .",
