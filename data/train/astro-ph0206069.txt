    "pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are objects still contracting to the main sequence ( ms ) and are divided into 2 classes according to their masses : t  tauri stars ( tts ) are low - mass pms stars with @xmath1m@xmath2m@xmath3m@xmath4 , while herbig  ae / be ( haebe ) stars represent their higher - mass counterparts with 2  m@xmath5 m @xmath6 m@xmath4 .",
    "these 2 classes of objects exhibit properties characteristic of their youth : ( 1 ) association with dark or bright nebulosities ( remnant of the parent cloud ) , ( 2 ) emission line spectrum ( spectral type f or later for the tts , a or b for the haebe ) , ( 3 ) ir excesses , ( 4 ) position above the ms in the hr diagram , and ( 5 ) presence of the absorption line . both types of pms stars show signs of circumstellar ( cs ) material in their environment , in the form of jets and bipolar flows , emission excesses in the ir , mm and sub - mm domains , p  cygni or inverse p  cygni profiles , linear polarization , and resolved disks or envelopes around some of the objects . in the case of binary stars ,",
    "the disks can be found around each component ( circumstellar ( cs ) disks ) and/or around the binary system ( circumbinary ( cb ) disks ) .",
    "variability is observed in photometry , spectroscopy , and polarimetry .",
    "tts are further divided into 2 classes according to the width of their h@xmath7 emission line .",
    "classical tts ( ctts ) have wide h@xmath7 emission lines with @xmath8  whereas the weak - line tts ( wtts ) have @xmath9   ( bertout 1989 ) .",
    "naked tts ( ntts ) are a subclass of the wtts ( walter 1986 ; wolk & walter 1996 ) , although some tend to use both terms as synonyms . indeed , in addition to narrower h@xmath7 lines",
    ", the ntts specifically do not show evidence for circumstellar ( cs ) material in their environments in the form of ir excesses , whereas the wtts may or may not ( wolk & walter 1996 ) .",
    "wtts and ntts should not be confused with post - t  tauri stars , which are still above the ms , but more evolved than tts . for a review on t  tauri stars and herbig  ae",
    "/ be stars , see for example bertout ( 1989 ) and catala ( 1989 ) .",
    "dust grains produce polarization by scattering , polarization that has been known for a number of years ( see bastien 1996 for a review ) .",
    "in general , the red part of the visible spectrum of tts exhibits linear polarizations of 12% , but the polarization distributions of ctts and wtts are markedly different : there are a few ctts which have a very high polarization ( more than 5% , sometimes up to 15% ) , but wtts almost all have polarization levels below 2% ( bastien 1982 , 1985 ; mnard & bastien 1992 ) . also , most tts that have an active cs disk have higher polarization and near ir excess than other tts ( yudin 2000 ) . on average ,",
    "haebe stars are more polarized than tts ( 3.0% versus 1.6% ) , and there are clear differences between the polarization distributions for tts and haebe stars ( yudin 2000 ) .",
    "most pms stars have statistically higher polarization levels than more evolved stars which are closer to the ms and there is clear evidence of changes in polarimetric behavior of stars during the evolution from pms to ms star ; these changes in polarimetric behavior are related to the evolution of the cs environment ( yudin 2000 ) .",
    "the ir color indices and color excesses of tts are well correlated with the polarization ( bastien 1985 ) , implying that the same grains are responsible for both phenomenons .",
    "a compilation of polarization data for almost 500 tts and haebe stars studied by yudin ( 2000 ) reveals that for 85% of the sample stars , there is a correlation between the degree of polarization and the ir color index @xmath10 and the color excess @xmath11 .",
    "this polarization is variable in a majority of objects : more than 85% of the tts , and more than 70% of haebe stars present variability ( bastien 1988 ; mnard & bastien 1992 ) . variations are sometimes large and fast ( @xmath12% , @xmath13 , within 5 days , bastien 1985 ) , sometimes associated with luminosity and color changes ( grinin et al .",
    "1991 ; grinin , kolotilov , & rostopchina 1995 ) , and in some cases periodic .",
    "we have shown ( manset & bastien 2000 , 2001a , hereafter paper  i and ii ) how the linear polarization of a binary surrounded by circumstellar matter varies periodically as a function of the orbital period , and how the geometry of the disks , the nature and characteristics of the scatterers , the masses of the stars , and the orbit characteristics affect the polarimetric curves .",
    "models can be used to find the orbital inclination from observed polarimetric variations ( see for example rudy & kemp 1978 ; brown , mclean , & emslie 1978 ) . the work from brown et al .",
    "( 1978 ) ( hereafter bme ) uses first- and second - order fourier analysis of the stokes curves to give , in addition to the orbital inclination , moments related to the distribution of the scatterers in the cs and cb environments .",
    "the bme formalism was developed for thomson scattering in optically thin envelopes , and for binaries in circular orbits . since polarization in pms stars",
    "is produced by scattering on dust grains , and most of the known spectroscopic pms binaries have eccentric orbits , the bme formalism can not be used a priori .",
    "however , we have shown ( paper  i and ii ) that the bme analysis can still be applied in those cases , with a few limitations .    in this context",
    ", we have obtained polarimetric observations of 24 spectroscopic pms binaries .",
    "a detailed analysis was presented for one of these binaries , the haebe star mwc  1080 ( manset & bastien 2001b , hereafter paper  iii ) .",
    "here we report the complete observations and detailed analysis for the pms binaries located in the taurus , auriga , and orion star forming regions ( sfrs ) .",
    "binaries located in the scorpius and ophiucus regions will be analyzed in a future paper .",
    "we have observed 24 pms spectroscopic binaries with @xmath14 ; the shortest - period and brightest ones ( @xmath15 d , @xmath16 ) were followed with @xmath17 or more observations .",
    "these stars were chosen mainly from the list in mathieu ( 1994 ) , to which we added subsequent discoveries .",
    "tables  [ tab - coord ] and [ tab - spectro ] present basic information ( other names , coordinates , location ) , and spectroscopic and orbital data ( spectral type , pms type , orbital period and eccentricity , orbital inclination when known , and distance ) for the 14 binaries located in the taurus , orion , and auriga sfrs .",
    "the binaries were observed at the observatoire du mont mgantic ( omm ) , qubec , canada , between 1994 september and 1999 march , using a @xmath18 aperture hole and a broad red filter ( rg645 : 7660 central wavelength , 2410   full width at half maximum ) .",
    "polarimetric data were taken with beauty and the beast , a two - channel photo - electric polarimeter , which uses a wollaston prism , a pockels cell , and an additional quarter - wave plate .",
    "the data were calibrated for instrumental efficiency , instrumental polarization ( due to the telescope s mirrors ) , and zero point of position angle , using a glan - thomson prism , non - polarized standard stars , and polarized standard stars respectively .",
    "the observational errors were calculated from photon statistics , and also include uncertainties introduced by the previously mentioned calibrations .",
    "the final uncertainty on individual measurements of the polarization @xmath19 is usually in the range 0.030.05% .",
    "the relative errors in position angle @xmath20 can be as low as 0.1 , but due to instrumental effects , systematic errors , and the calibration procedure itself , the absolute errors on the position angles are of the order of 1@xmath21 . for more details on the instrument and the observational method ,",
    "see manset & bastien ( 1995 , 2001b ) and manset ( 2000 ) .",
    "table  [ tab - averpol ] summarizes the observations and gives the number of observations , the average polarization and position angle .",
    "polarimetric observations are usually a sum of interstellar ( and sometimes also intra - cluster ) and intrinsic polarizations .",
    "an estimation of the interstellar ( is ) polarization for each object observed can be used to assess the presence of intrinsic polarization .",
    "we have used the heiles ( 2000 ) catalog of over 9000 polarization measurements to determine if the observed polarization for the pms binaries studied here is of intrinsic or is origin , or a combination of both .",
    "this catalog is an improvement over the one from mathewson et al .",
    "( 1978 ) : it contains additional observations , all data were verified , and more precise coordinates are given .",
    "for each observed pms binary , the catalog was scanned to select at least 20 close stars _ with a similar distance_. depending on the stellar density and number of measurements in the catalog , this led to the selection of a region between 1 and 15  in radius around the target , and within 70 to 350  pc of it .",
    "the stars selected from the catalog are used to give an average of the is polarization in that region around the target , and also to find the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "finally , based on an extinction value for our target and assuming this extinction is of is origin only , an estimate of the is polarization for the target is calculated , along with the average is polarization angle .",
    "this angle is calculated with a simple average and with a distance - weighted average of the polarization angles of all the stars selected . in all the cases here ,",
    "the two values are similar to within their uncertainty , which indicates that the alignment is good over all the regions studied , and the is polarization value estimated is reliable .",
    "if the position angles for the is polarization and for the target are different , it points to an intrinsic origin for at least part of the polarization measured .",
    "intrinsic polarization is also deduced from polarimetric variability .",
    "results are presented in table  [ tab - averpol ] , where the weighted averages of the observed @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given along with the possible origin of the observed polarization : a @xmath23 symbol indicates intrinsic polarization while is stands for interstellar polarization .",
    "when is comes before a @xmath23 symbol , the is component of the polarization is probably stronger than the intrinsic one , and vice versa .",
    "the following columns present our calculation of the is polarization ( polarization and position angle , along with their uncertainties ) , based on a weighted average of the polarization of neighboring stars located at similar distances , where more weight is given to stars closer to the pms binary .",
    "since non - weighted and weighted averages give similar results , only the latter average is presented .",
    "we also give @xmath24 , the number of measurements used to estimate this is polarization , and the radius and the interval of distance of the region considered .",
    "subtracting the is polarization from the observed one gives the intrinsic polarization , shown in the last columns .",
    "note that the is polarization given in columns 69 of table  [ tab - averpol ] is only an _ estimate _ for the _ whole region _ around a binary , and in some cases might not apply to a given binary .",
    "in particular , it may not include very localized intra - cluster polarization .",
    "consequently , the intrinsic polarizations given in the last columns should be considered crude estimations only , intended to give an idea of the polarimetric characteristics of the observed binaries as a whole , and not a definitive value of the intrinsic polarization for each binary .    to determine if an observed polarization has an is component , we give more weight to the value of @xmath25 deduced from neighboring stars than to @xmath26 .",
    "we do not have the wavelength dependence of the observed polarization , which can usually be used to extract the is component . to help determine",
    "if there is an intrinsic component of polarization , we also use the level of polarimetric variability since is polarization is very stable .",
    "since a majority of single pms stars are variable polarimetrically ( bastien 1982 ; drissen , bastien , & st - louis 1989 ; mnard & bastien 1992 ) , we expected pms binaries to also be polarimetrically variable , either periodically or not .",
    "we applied various tests to check the polarimetric variability or stability of pms binaries : minimum and maximum values , variance test , @xmath27 test and a similar one we call @xmath28 and @xmath29 test , and finally , a @xmath30 test .",
    "we have not retained skewness and kurtosis tests ( which measure departure from a normal distribution ) because the number of data points is for some stars very limited , and the results sometimes difficult to interpret .",
    "it should be noted that these tests usually assume that the parent distribution of the quantity measured ( here , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or the stokes parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) is normal .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not distributed normally ( serkowski 1958 ) , these tests should in general be applied only to the stokes parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "many pms binaries show observations with polarization levels and/or position angle well below or above the bulk of the data . assuming these observations are atypical but nonetheless real , we have removed them before using the tests .",
    "this allows us to study the more typical variations .",
    "we believe these atypical observations are real : close examination of polarization observations taken over 5 years of non - polarized standard stars ( 84 observations ) , polarized standard stars ( 53 observations ) , 3 stars that were followed for many consecutive hours ( 121 observations ) did not show odd observations like the ones we repeatedly saw for pms binaries ( manset 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we believe these observations were due to some eruption - like events or significant modifications in the cs environment ( e.g. , formation / destruction of condensations , accretion events ) , and not because of an instrumental problem .      one crude but easy way to check for variability in a set of observations is to compare the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a quantity with its average or typical observational uncertainty ; variable observations will have maximum and minimum values well outside the range expected from the observational uncertainty . this test was applied to all the sets of observations , after removing the observations that showed the most deviation from the majority of the observations .",
    "this test should not be used alone since it does not take into account the entirety of the data .",
    "given a set of @xmath33 observations @xmath34 where @xmath35 , we can calculate the variance of the sample ( which is a measure of the `` width '' of the observations , or of the scatter from the mean , or of the `` variability '' around a central value , usually measured with the mean @xmath36 ) with the formula : @xmath37 which , in computer programs , can also be calculated more rapidly ( without having first to determine the mean @xmath36 ) with : @xmath38 this sample variance can then be compared to the standard deviation of the mean , which gives the error from photon statistics as if all the observations had been added together : @xmath39    for a set of observations of a non - variable quantity , the sample variance will be low ( the observations are all clustered closely to the mean ) and similar to the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "but if there is variability , the `` width '' of the observations will be greater than the standard deviation of the mean : @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that it is assumed the parent population is distributed normally , so this test will be meaningful only for the stokes parameters .",
    "given a quantity @xmath41 for which we have @xmath33 measurements @xmath42 , we can calculate the weighted mean : @xmath43 with its associated variance , which we will call the `` external '' variance : @xmath44 alternatively , the variance may be computed according to the weighted residuals , giving an `` internal '' assessment of the distribution : @xmath45    we then build the quantity @xmath27 : @xmath46    if the data are `` well behaved '' , @xmath27 should equal unity ( brooks et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the standard error of @xmath27 is ( topping 1972 ) : @xmath47    this test should be applied to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and not to @xmath19 and @xmath20 . if @xmath48 within its standard error , then the measurements are `` consistent '' , and there is no variability .",
    "if @xmath27 differs significantly from 1 , then there may be variability .",
    "for details , see brooks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 test is similar to the @xmath27 test , except that it is applied to the polarization @xmath19 and its position angle @xmath20 .",
    "given a set of @xmath33 polarimetric observations of the stokes parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we can compare the variance of the polarization @xmath49 with the scatter from the mean of the polarization @xmath50 : @xmath51^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath52    for the position angle , we can calculate @xmath53 and @xmath54 with the following formula : @xmath55    if @xmath56 then there may be variability .",
    "bastien et al . ( 1988 ) used this method to assess the polarimetric variability of polarimetric standard stars .",
    "clarke & naghizadeh - khouei ( 1994 ) make the remark that @xmath29 should be the weighted mean .      in bastien",
    "( 1988 ) and bastien ( 1982 ) , a @xmath30-based method is presented : @xmath30 values are calculated for @xmath31 and @xmath32 separately , using 1@xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then , the probability to obtain a given value of @xmath30 in a gaussian distribution is found for each of the four @xmath30 values .",
    "the star is variable if at least 2 of the four @xmath30 values are over 0.95 ; the star is suspected to be variable if one out of four @xmath30 values is over 0.95 .",
    "the minimum and maximum values test is not a robust test ; stars that do not show minimum and maximum values out of the range expected from the observational uncertainty ( @xmath59 intervals ) are found to have a non - variable behavior by other tests , but the converse is not true .",
    "the variance and @xmath27 tests were used only for the stokes parameters ( and not for the polarization and its position angle ) .",
    "the @xmath27 test was considered positive if @xmath60 ; values of @xmath27 below ( @xmath61 ) were considered dubious , since @xmath62 means the data are too well behaved with respect to the statistical ( observational ) uncertainty .",
    "the variance test was considered positive if @xmath63 ; that way , the variance and @xmath27 tests would give consistent results .",
    "with @xmath64 , the variance test would sometimes see variability where the @xmath27 test would not .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 tests were not considered as primary tests , since they apply to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are not normally distributed , and because @xmath29 is not weighted .",
    "but the results of this test agree with the conclusions reached with other tests .",
    "for the @xmath30 test , as in bastien et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and bastien ( 1982 ) , the star is considered variable if at least 2 of the four @xmath30 values are over 0.95 ; the star is suspected to be variable if one out of four @xmath30 values is over 0.95 .    using , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 separately ,",
    "the @xmath65 test , the @xmath60 test , and the @xmath30 test , we established the variability , suspected variability , suspected stability , and stability with the following criteria ( see also table  [ tab - usevartests ] ) :    * to be considered variable , a star must have at least 2 positive results from the @xmath27 and variance tests and at least 2 positive results from the @xmath30 test ; * * if there are only 2 positive results from the @xmath27 and variance tests , they must be 2 positive @xmath27 tests , or a positive @xmath27 and positive variance tests for the same stokes parameter ; * * if there are only 2 positive results from the @xmath30 test , they must be for the same stokes parameters as the positive @xmath27 and variance tests . * to be considered",
    "as suspected variable , the results of the @xmath27 and variance tests must be the same as for the variable conclusion , but only one @xmath30 value must be positive . *",
    "a star is considered as possibly constant if the @xmath30 test is negative ( for the 4 @xmath30 values ) , but at least 3 values from the @xmath27 and variance tests indicate possible variability . *",
    "if the @xmath27 and @xmath30 tests are negative and only 1 or 2 values of the variance test indicate variability , the star is considered to be constant .",
    "table  [ tab - ampvar ] presents the amplitude of the polarimetric variations , calculated by simply taking the difference between the minimum and maximum values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; note that for some cases , very atypical observations were not considered .",
    "the details of the variability tests presented in this sections are shown in table  [ tab - vardetails ] , where we give for each star the number of observations used for the variability tests , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath27 and its standard error , and @xmath68 , calculated with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the conclusions of the variability tests are shown in table  [ tab - var ] , where we have classified the stars as `` variable '' , `` suspected variable '' , and `` constant '' . of the 12 binaries which were tested for variability , 42% ( 5/12 ) are statistically variable ( v773  tau , v826  tau , gw  ori , par  1540 , w  134 ) , and 58% ( 7/12 ) are variable or possibly variable ( par  2486 , ori  569 ) .",
    "dq  tau and uz  tau e / w could not be tested because of the low number of observations ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively ) .",
    "five binaries have statistically constant polarization : lkca  3 , ntts  045251 + 3016 , ori  429 , par  2494 , and vsb  126 .",
    "we confirm the variability already reported for v773  tau ( mnard & bastien 1992 ) .",
    "our additional data establish the variability for the previously suspected variables v826  tau ( mnard & bastien 1992 ) and gw  ori ( bastien 1985 ) .",
    "in addition to the general variability , which is a known property of single pms stars , pms binaries will also present periodic polarimetric variations caused by the orbital motion , even if in some cases the amplitude may be too small to be detected with the currently available instruments or masked by non - periodic or pseudo - periodic variations . in the case of mie scattering , we have also shown in paper  ii that dust grains , which are mostly responsible for the polarization here , are less efficient polarizers and produce smaller amplitude variations than electrons .",
    "this is an indication that periodic polarimetric variations could be more difficult to observe in pms binaries than in , for example , hot binaries surrounded by electrons , which can easily exhibit variations of a few tenths of a percent ( see for example robert et al . 1990 ; robert et al .",
    "the size of the grains also determines the amplitude of the polarimetric variations : dust grains with radii @xmath73 produce the largest polarimetric variations ( paper  ii ) .    to look for periodic polarimetric variations ,",
    "the known orbital periods are used to calculate the orbital phase for each observation of each star . the polarization @xmath19 , its position angle @xmath20 , and the stokes parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 are plotted as a function of the orbital phase ( see figures  [ fig - v773tau ] to [ fig - vsb126 ] ) .",
    "when enough data are available , observations are represented as first and second harmonics of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the orbital phase : + @xmath76 the coefficients of this fit are then used to find the orbital inclination , following the bme formalism and using the first or second order fourier coefficients , although it is usually expected that second order variations will dominate ( bme ) : + @xmath77 ^ 2 & = & \\frac{(u_1+q_2)^2 + ( u_2-q_1)^2}{(u_2+q_1)^2 + ( u_1-q_2)^2 } \\label{eq - io1-p3 } , \\\\ \\left [ \\frac{1-\\cos i}{1+\\cos i } \\right]^4 & = & \\frac{(u_3+q_4)^2 + ( u_4-q_3)^2}{(u_4+q_3)^2 + ( u_3-q_4)^2 } \\label{eq - io2-p3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as can be seen in figures  [ fig - v773tau ] to [ fig - vsb126 ] , not all pms binaries show periodic polarimetric variations , and even then , those are not always clearly seen , which was expected to some extent .",
    "periodic polarimetric variations can be caused by the binarity ( orbital motion ) or the presence of hot or cool stellar spots , among a few reasons .",
    "classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) are known to have both cool and hot spots , and wtts generally have only cool spots ( bouvier et al .",
    "1993 ) , some of which can be stable over periods of several months ( on v410 tau for example , herbst 1989 ) . since most of the binaries observed here",
    "are wtts and in general only display small photometric variations , we believe that the spots causing the photometric variations , if present , are small , and then have a very small effect on the polarization . nonetheless , as can be seen in the figures , the appearance and disappearance of transient spots could be the cause of the non - periodic variations that introduce some scatter about the periodic variations .",
    "in addition to stellar spots , non - periodic phenomenon such as eruptive events , variable accretion and rearrangements of the cs or cb material can cause pseudo - periodic polarimetric variations that may mask the strictly periodic ones , especially if the observations are taken over many orbital periods , as is the case here .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "some binaries present periodic variations . to investigate the significance of this periodicity , a phase dispersion method ( stellingwerf 1978 ) and a lomb normalized periodogram algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1997 ) were used . the phase dispersion method ( pdm )",
    "is a least - squared fitting technique suited for non - sinusoidal time variations covered by irregularly spaced observations , and finds the period that produces the least scatter about the mean curve .",
    "the lomb normalized periodogram ( lnp ) method is more powerful than fast fourier transform methods for uneven sampling , but still assumes the curve is sinusoidal , which may not be always appropriate for the polarimetric observations presented here .",
    "the periods found by using both methods are very similar to one another for a given star , but the significance is usually marginal .",
    "the detailed observations are presented in tables  [ tab - v773tau ] to [ tab - autres ] and in figures  [ fig - v773tau ] to [ fig - vsb126 ] .",
    "v773  tau is a triple system in which the 51.075-day spectroscopic binary ( welty 1995 ) has a projected separation of 0.34  au ( jensen & mathieu 1997 ) .",
    "the third star is reported to be at @xmath78 from the spectroscopic binary at a position angle of 295  ( leinert et al . 1993 ) , or @xmath79 at position angle 295  ( ghez , neugebauer , & matthews 1993 ) . given the size of our aperture hole , this third star is also included in our measurements .",

    "( 1996 ) , but jensen & mathieu ( 1997 ) argue that the submm continuum emission must arise in a cb disk , although the presence of a third star could mean the submm and ir excesses are not coming from a cb disk , but from a cs disk around the tertiary . the @xmath81 upper limit to the disk s mass , based on 800  observations , is 0.001  m@xmath4 ( jensen et al .",

    "the limited number of observations ( 6 ) does not permit us to find any periodic polarimetric variations or to do a fit according to equations  [ p3-eq - qfit ] and [ p3-eq - ufit ] .",

    "it has a nir excess more typical of ctts , that can not be entirely attributed to dark spots , and that indicates some warm dust resides within 0.3  au of the binary ; on the other hand , its weak emission lines make it a wtts ( padgett & stapelfeldt 1994 ) .",
    "it has not been detected longward of 12  so it probably does not have a cb disk ( jensen & mathieu 1997 ) .    when using an approximate @xmath138 , the orbital period and the derived stellar radii , and the assumption that the system is tidally locked , the inclination is then @xmath139 ( padgett & stapelfeldt 1994 ) .",
    "theoretical masses give an orbital inclination of @xmath140 , which could be sufficient for grazing eclipses , given the stellar radii derived , but photometric monitorings during zero velocity separation events did not show any decrease in brightness ( padgett & stapelfeldt 1994 ) .",

    "the rapid change in position angle is seen near phase 0.55 and not at the predicted phases for the eclipses ; nonetheless , more polarimetric data should be taken near phase 0.55 to investigate the cause of the atypical polarimetric observations .",
    "data for this 12.924-day binary ( mathieu 1994 ) are presented in table  [ tab - vsb126 ] and figure  [ fig - vsb126 ] .",
    "the mean polarization at 7660  , 0.16% at 66 , is statistically constant .",
    "vsb  126 is within 0.2  of w  134 ( see map in figure  [ fig - polis_w134_vsb126 ] ) , and therefore is also affected by an is polarization component at 177 .",
    "its low and constant polarization , with an average of 0.16% at 66 , is intrinsic with an is component .",
    "one of the goals of these polarimetric observations is to determine the orbital inclinations of the selected pms binaries , by using the bme formalism .",
    "this formalism can still be used if the orbits are non - circular and the scatterers are spherical grains , within the limits presented in papers  i and ii , and even if the bme formalism , with its first and second harmonics only , does not reproduce exactly the variations of eccentric systems .",
    "noise with a standard deviation greater than 10% of the amplitude of the polarimetric variations will prevent the bme formalism from finding a reasonable estimate of the true inclination ( paper  i ) .",
    "other studies have also shown that the quality of the data ( number of data points , observational errors , amplitude of the polarimetric variations ) can strongly influence the results found by the bme formalism .",
    "aspin , simmons , & brown ( 1981 ) have studied what standard deviation @xmath144 is necessary to determine the inclination @xmath145 to @xmath146 , with a 90% confidence level .",
    "they give an approximate relation for the data quality @xmath147 : + @xmath148 where @xmath149 @xmath150 is the observational error on the polarization , @xmath151 is the observed polarimetric variability calculated with equation  [ eq - a ] , @xmath152 is the number of observations , and @xmath153 ( the number of bins in their simulations ) .",
    "a set of very good quality observations will have a low value of @xmath147 .",
    "we present in table  [ tab - noisebme ] , column 2 , @xmath147 values for the binaries studied here . after the quantity @xmath154",
    "is calculated , table 1 in aspin et al .",
    "( 1981 ) gives the lowest possible inclination that can be determined from the observations with a @xmath155 accuracy at a significance of 10% ( meaning that the true inclination has a probability of 90% to be in within 5  of the value returned by the bme formalism ) .",
    "if we apply this method to our sets of data , we find that the quality of our data do not allow us to find @xmath145 to @xmath146 , with a 90% confidence level , for any of our binaries .",
    "wolinski & dolan ( 1994 ) have also studied the confidence intervals for orbital parameters determined polarimetrically .",
    "they made monte carlo simulations of noisy polarimetric observations , for a specific geometry not suitable for the stars studied in this present paper , but their results are nonetheless instructive .",
    "confidence intervals for @xmath145 are given graphically as a function of a `` figure of merit '' @xmath156 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the standard deviation of the noise that was added to the data and @xmath33 is the number of observations .",
    "we have calculated and present in column 3 of table  [ tab - noisebme ] the figures of merit @xmath156 for some pms binaries , by using the observational error @xmath159 instead of the @xmath158 used by wolinski & dolan .",
    "it is again seen that the quality of the data is not very good , mostly because the amplitude @xmath160 is rather low ( between 0.02 and 0.10% in general ) .",
    "finally , following our own studies of the effects of noise on the bme results ( paper  i ) , we have calculated the noise for the stokes parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , by using the variance of the fit and the amplitude of the polarimetric variations ; these amplitudes are computed from the maximum and minimum values of the observations , and not those of the fit .",
    "these calculations are presented in columns 4 and 5 of table  [ tab - noisebme ] , where levels of noise below 10% are rare . once again",
    ", this analysis shows that the polarimetric observations of pms stars are not of `` very good quality '' , not because of instrumental or observational problems , but because non - periodic stochastic polarization variations and low amplitude periodic variations make the data rather noisy , hiding the periodic polarimetric variations that most probably exist .",
    "one of the stars for which the polarimetric variations are very clear and might be of good enough quality for the bme formalism to work is ak  sco ( manset & bastien , in preparation ) ; this star is the only one for which the data were obtained within a few ( 12 ) consecutive nights .",
    "all the other stars were observed over 3 - 5 years . for these ,",
    "non periodic polarimetric events , or changes in the circumstellar environment from epoch to epoch , mask the periodic variations and introduce too much noise .",
    "future observations should be obtained at a site offering many consecutive clear nights to cover in one run the whole orbital period .    assuming the bme formalism can be used to analyze the polarimetric variations of binary pms stars , we have added in table  [ tab - noisebme ] the results of the bme analysis for the orbital inclination .",
    "most of the inclinations are near 90 , which can not be a real result .",
    "this is compatible with the above discussion on the effects of the stochastic noise on the inclination analysis , and does not necessarily mean that the bme analysis can not be used for these systems .",
    "in addition to the orbital inclination , the bme formalism returns @xmath161 , the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky , and moments of the distribution of the scatterers , which are used to measure the asymmetry with respect to the orbital plane ( @xmath162 ) , and the degree of concentration towards the orbital plane ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "it is generally expected that the distribution will be symmetric and concentrated in the orbital plane , so @xmath164 . in table",
    "[ tab - omegagammas ] , we present the values of @xmath161 , @xmath163 , @xmath165 , and the ratio @xmath166 .",
    "if the circumbinary disks of these binaries can be imaged ( with interferometric or adaptive optics techniques ) , their orientation should be similar to @xmath161 , although the orbits are not necessarily coplanar with the disks or envelopes .",
    "the values for @xmath165 and @xmath167 are similar to those we have found in numerical simulations ( paper  i ) , and to the observed values for other types of binaries ( bastien 1988 ; koch et al .",
    "in particular , @xmath164 as expected , with ratios approximately from 1.0 to 4.0 .",
    "these parameters are also calculated using the coefficients of the fits and the same assumptions ( the scatterers are electrons , the orbits are circular ) .",
    "however , single - periodic variations that are not present when the scatterers are electrons and the orbits are circular , do appear in our simulations when there are dust grains instead of electrons , variable optical depth effects are considered , or the orbits are eccentric ( paper  i and ii ) . therefore , the values of the parameters calculated might not reflect an asymmetric configuration ( @xmath165 ) or a concentration toward the orbital plane ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "for example , we have found , using the code presented in papers  i and ii , that even though @xmath165 should be null for a perfectly symmetric configuration , it will not be if we have dust grains or consider variable optical depth effects .",
    "we have presented polarimetric observations for 14 spectroscopic pms binaries located in the taurus , auriga , and orion sfrs . the majority of the pms binaries observed have a detectable linear polarization ; only lkca  3 , ntts  045251 + 3016 , ori  569 , and vsb  126 do not present polarization levels above the @xmath81 limit . for most binaries ,",
    "is polarization is also an important component of the observations .",
    "after an estimation of this is polarization is removed , a few ( 5 out of 14 ) of the binaries present clear indications of intrinsic polarizations @xmath168 and significantly above the is polarization : v826  tau , uz  tau  e / w , dq  tau , gw  ori , and par  1540 .",
    "overall , 7 of our 14 binaries , including all the clearly identified ctts binaries ( uz  tau  e , dq  tau , and gw  ori ; mathieu et al .",
    "1997 ) , show intrinsic polarizations above 0.5% .",
    "interestingly , then , even the wtts and ntts , for which other types of observations are not indicative of significant amounts of circumstellar material , can have detectable levels of polarization .    as has been found for single pms stars ,",
    "the polarization of pms binaries is variable .",
    "all binaries are statistically variable or suspected variable , except lkca  3 , ntts  045251 + 3016 , par  2494 , ori  429 , and vsb  126 . despite the results of those tests , graphs of polarimetric data as a function of orbital phase show that lkca  3",
    "could be variable in position angle , and par  2494 is clearly variable in @xmath20 .",
    "not enough data are available for dq  tau to determine its variability . when combining data from literature and our two observations for uz  tau  e / w , variability is present",
    ". therefore , we find that 54% of the pms binaries are variable ( 7 of out 13 ) , or 77% ( 10 out of 13 ) variable or possibly so ; these results are compatible with those of bastien ( 1988 ) and mnard & bastien ( 1992 ) .",
    "all the known ctts binaries in our sample ( except maybe dq  tau for which we only have one measurement ) present polarimetric variations . many ntts or wtts also show polarimetric variations .",
    "therefore , around these stars , although it is not thought that there is much cs material , there is enough to produce polarimetric variations , as it can be shown that very little mass in the form of dust is needed to produce detectable levels of polarization .",
    "some stars have shown , once or even a few times , atypical values of polarization and/or position angle that are well below or above the rest of the data ( par  1540 , par  2494 , and also mwc  1080 , paper  iii ) .",
    "we believe these are real observations of events that strongly affected the stars and/or their environment .",
    "single pms stars are known sometimes to be strongly variable , so this is not a surprise . for the stars with a sufficient amount of data ,",
    "additional observations at similar phases indicate that these atypical points are not related to the normal periodic behavior .",
    "photometry or spectroscopy obtained at the same times as those of the atypical observations could help reveal the cause .",
    "only 6 binaries have enough observations to investigate the presence of periodic polarimetric variations : lkca  3 , v826  tau , gw  ori , par  1540 , par  2494 , and w  134 .",
    "statistical tests conclude that lkca  3 s and par  2494 s polarization is constant , but low amplitude periodic variations are nonetheless present .",
    "the position angle for lkca  3 s polarization outlines a sinusoidal wave between phases 0.2 and 0.65 ; since the data were obtained over 22 months , representing more than 600 orbits , it can not be attributed to coincidence , but to a real variation .",
    "although par  2494 s observations are rather noisy , binned data reveal low amplitude periodic variations in position angle .",
    "therefore , low amplitude variations , especially if masked by noise , can be missed by statistical tests for variability , because these only consider the whole of the observations without their known order ( as a function of phase ) .",
    "a third binary , par  1540 , shows periodic variations , although they also are of low amplitude . period analysis for par  1540 and par  2494 , with pdm and lnp , confirm that the periodicity is due to the orbital motion , although not with a very high significance .",
    "non - periodic or pseudo - periodic polarimetric variations could explain why it is difficult to see periodic variations and confirm them with period analysis methods .",
    "those non - periodic variations may be caused by appearance or disappearance of hot or cool spots , flares , or major changes in the distribution or density of matter in the cs or cb environment .",
    "to avoid or at least decrease the effects of those events , observations should be carried on consecutive nights before any major stochastic change in polarization occurs , and until the orbital period has been sufficiently covered .",
    "those three pms binaries which exhibit low amplitude polarimetric variations are wtts ; this indicates that there is still enough dust in their environment to produce polarization and periodic variations .",
    "a fourth interesting case is w  134 , which may be an eclipsing system : two atypical position angles , taken more than a year apart , are seen near phase 0.55 ; such rapid changes are sometimes seen for eclipsing binaries ( for example in the eclipsing binary ek  cep , manset & bastien in preparation ; see also st - louis et al .",
    "the rapid change in position angle is not at the predicted phases for the eclipses ; nonetheless , more polarimetric data should be taken near phase 0.55 to investigate the cause of the atypical polarimetric observations .",
    "one of the goals of these observations was to find the orbital inclinations .",
    "unfortunately , non - periodic or pseudo - periodic variations sometimes mask the truly periodic variations by introducing noise .",
    "this noise , as measured by 3 different methods , is too high for the bme formalism to find reasonable estimates of the orbital inclination .",
    "three factors contribute to this difficulty .",
    "first , dust grains are the main scatterers in these systems , and it has been shown that dust grain produce polarimetric variations of smaller amplitude than electrons ( paper  ii ) .",
    "second , the disk around these short - period binaries are probably cb rather than cs ones , and cb disks produce variations of smaller amplitudes than cs disks ( paper  ii ) .",
    "finally , non - periodic events introduce noise that masks the already small amplitude variations . this last problem",
    "might only be improved by taking data on shorter periods of time .",
    "other parameters are returned by the bme formalism : @xmath161 , the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky , and moments of the distribution of the scatterers , used to measure the asymmetry with respect to the orbital plane ( @xmath165 ) , and the degree of concentration towards the orbital plane ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "although the assumptions used in the bme formalism ( scattering on electrons , circular orbits ) are not met in the pms binaries studied here and we have shown that even in simple cases the values are incorrect , the values returned for pms binaries are of the same order of magnitude as values for other types of stars and as for our simulations .",

    "<S> we present polarimetric observations of 14 pre - main - sequence ( pms ) binaries located in the taurus , auriga , and orion star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the average observed polarizations are below 0.5% , and none are above 0.9% . </S>",
    "<S> after removal of estimates of the interstellar polarization , about half the binaries have an _ intrinsic _ polarization above 0.5% , even though most of them do not present other evidences for the presence of circumstellar dust . </S>",
    "<S> various tests reveal that 77% of the pms binaries have or possibly have a variable polarization . </S>",
    "<S> lkca  3 , par  1540 , and par  2494 present detectable periodic and phase - locked variations . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic polarimetric variations are noisier and of a lesser amplitude ( @xmath00.1% ) than for other types of binaries , such as hot stars . </S>",
    "<S> this could be due to stochastic events that produce deviations in the average polarization , a non - favorable geometry ( circumbinary envelope ) , or the nature of the scatterers ( dust grains are less efficient polarizers than electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> par  1540 is a weak - line t  tauri star , but nonetheless has enough dust in its environment to produce detectable levels of polarization and variations . </S>",
    "<S> a fourth interesting case is w  134 , which displays rapid changes in polarization that could be due to eclipses . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observations with some of our numerical simulations , and also show that an analysis of the periodic polarimetric variations with the brown , mclean , & emslie ( bme ) formalism to find the orbital inclination is for the moment premature : non - periodic events introduce stochastic noise that partially masks the periodic low - amplitude variations and prevents the bme formalism from finding a reasonable estimate of the orbital inclination . </S>"
