    "[ sec : intro ]    the role of rotation in powering the explosion of supernovae has long been debated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most recent work has focused on the possibility that a rotating neutron star could , by way of a magnetic interaction , be the energy source for _ exploding _ a massive star . while that issue is far from resolved , and recent headway has been made in exploding these same stars using neutrino transport , it is certain that a large fraction of supernova explosions produce rotating neutron stars and that those neutron stars frequently have large magnetic fields .",
    "magnetars are a class of neutron stars with field strengths 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath2 gauss and more",
    ". they may constitute 10% of the neutron star birthrate @xcite .",
    "it is likely that fast rotation in the collapsing iron core is responsible for creating the large magnetic field @xcite , so it is reasonable to expect that the birth of rapidly rotating , highly magnetic neutron stars is commonplace .",
    "it is also generally assumed that these rapidly rotating neutron stars are magnetically braked by dipole emission early on , accounting for the slow periods observed in anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite . since the initial rotational energy of such stars at birth must have been large and 1000 years later",
    "is small , where did the difference go ? might it have been emitted in some observable form",
    "?    as a rough approximation , assume that the neutron star radiates its rotational energy away at a rate given by the traditional dipole formula for pulsars .",
    "for a typical moment of inertia of 10@xmath3 g @xmath4 , the rotational energy of a neutron star with period , p@xmath5 , in milliseconds is @xmath6 the approximate energy loss for dipole radiation is given by the larmor formula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the surface dipole field in 10@xmath2 gauss , @xmath9 cm is the neutron star radius , and @xmath10 is the inclination angle between the magnetic and rotational axes , taken arbitrarily to be 30 degrees .    at face value , these simple formulae suggest large luminosities for magnetars during the first few weeks of their lives . for example , the magnetar in sgr 1627 - 41 is estimated to have a current spin - down luminosity of @xmath11 erg s@xmath12 at an age of 2.2 ky implying a magnetic field @xmath13 gauss @xcite . extrapolated back to when the magnetar was 10 days old , equation  [ eq : dipole ] implies a luminosity of @xmath14 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "provided the initial rotation rate was rapid compared with its value at 10 days , this result is independent of the initial rotation rate .    here",
    "we explore the observational characteristics of type ib / c supernovae in which pulsars with magnetar - like characteristics have been embedded .",
    "the brightest supernovae actually come from neutron stars with fields that , for a magnetar , are relatively modest , @xmath15 gauss .",
    "larger fields imply that most of the magnetar s rotational energy is dissipated early on , adding to the kinetic energy and mixing , but not appreciably affecting the luminosity .",
    "these luminous magnetar - powered supernovae might easily be confused with other forms of `` hypernovae '' where the luminosity has a radioactive origin .",
    "alternatively , the lack of such emission constrains the existence of any rapidly rotating magnetar .",
    "this could be an important constraint in the context of gamma - ray bursts where the the possibility of a magnetar power source is currently debated .",
    "the presupernova model adopted for our first study is a 4.37  wolf - rayet star derived from the evolution of single 35  main sequence star @xcite .",
    "magnetars may originate from a population this massive or larger @xcite , and the relatively small helium core mass will demonstrate the possibility of a very luminous supernova from a light progenitor . a heavier model is explored later . this star was exploded with a piston located at 1.89 , the base of the former oxygen burning shell where the entropy per baryon was @xmath16 = 4.0 .",
    "the piston was moved with a speed such as to impart a final kinetic energy ( without any pulsar addition ) of @xmath17 erg and produce 0.05  of @xmath0ni ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "the specific nature of this initial explosion is left unspecified .",
    "it could have been the result of successful neutrino - mediated transport or a consequence of early energy deposition related to the formation of the magnetar itself .    .",
    "the kinetic energy of the explosion is @xmath18 erg without the pulsar , @xmath19 erg with it .",
    "[ fig : comp],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    ten seconds after the explosion , when all important nucleosynthesis had ceased and the shock wave was still about 0.5  beneath the stellar surface , energy deposition from an assumed embedded magnetar was turned on .",
    "a magnetic field of 10@xmath1 gauss and an initial rotation period of 4.5 ms were assumed , corresponding to a rotational kinetic energy of 10@xmath20 erg .",
    "energy from the magnetar was deposited in the inner 10 zones of the model at a rate given by equation  [ eq : dipole ] and complete trapping was always assumed .",
    "while the form of the energy deposition was unspecified , it could be accelerated particles or radiation of any wavelength to which the supernova is initially opaque .",
    "the initial luminosity of the assumed pulsar was 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath12 ( equation  [ eq : dipole ] ) which declined to 10@xmath21 erg s@xmath12 after @xmath22 s. after @xmath23 s the rotation period was 1.0 s.    the resulting light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lite ] . at early times",
    "the effect of the magnetar was negligible .",
    "later , some of the energy went into accelerating the ejecta to higher speeds and creating a `` bubble '' inside the supernova . later",
    "the energy was mostly radiated away and , at late times , the supernova luminosity tracked equation  [ eq : dipole ] .",
    "the light curve peaked at @xmath24 erg s@xmath12 ( about 5 typical type ia supernovae ) at 37 days . at that time , the pulsar was depositing @xmath25 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "the rise time from 10@xmath21 erg s@xmath12 was 24 days .",
    "gauss ; @xmath26 = 10@xmath20 erg ) emitting dipole radiation is embedded .",
    "complete trapping of the magnetar emission is assumed at all times . shown for comparison",
    "is the energy released by the decay of 4  of @xmath0ni .",
    "if the light curve at peak had been powered by radioactivity it would have required 7 .",
    "the second solid line , slightly displaced to later times , shows the light curve of a heavier star ( 7.29 ) exploded with the same energy and containing the same magnetar ( see   [ sec : heavy ] ) .",
    "[ fig : lite],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    also of some interest is now the magnetar emission modifies the dynamics of the explosion . without the pulsar ,",
    "the explosion energy was @xmath27 erg ; with it the explosion energy is increased to @xmath19 erg .",
    "that is about 40% of the magnetar energy went into kinetic energy of expansion , while the remainder went into radiation .",
    "energy was not deposited uniformly in the ejecta though . because the pulsar was a central source of heating , its energy went into inflating a bubble of lower density material inside the supernova .",
    "the boundary of this bubble is a dense shell in which resides about a solar mass of the ejecta ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] ) .",
    "other calculations , not illustrated here , show that if one assumes a larger magnetar rotational energy or stronger magnetic field , the velocity and mass of this thin shell are increased .    in three dimensions ,",
    "this shell is probably unstable and , rather than being ejected as a thin spherical shell , the ejecta are probably mixed",
    ". this will affect the light curve , perhaps making it rise at an earlier time .",
    "multi - dimensional studies of the coupled radiation transport and hydrodynamics are needed and are feasible , but are postponed for now .",
    "this mixing will also have important implications for the spectrum , especially at late times .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "[ sec : heavy ]    the same magnetar in supernovae with different masses and kinetic energies will give supernovae with different properties .",
    "consider first the effect of the same magnetar as in the previous section ( @xmath28 erg , @xmath29 ) embedded in a type ib supernova with mass 7.29 .",
    "the presupernova star here was the remnant of a 60  main sequence star of solar metallicity , again taken from the study of @xcite .",
    "the star was exploded , as before , with a piston at the base of the oxygen shell ( 1.59 ) and given a final kinetic energy of @xmath27 erg .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis produced 0.11  of @xmath0ni though the effect of @xmath0ni decay was _ not _ included in the plots shown .",
    "[ fig : lite ] already showed the resulting light curve .",
    "it is very nearly the same as for the lower mass model . with its larger mass and similar kinetic energy ,",
    "the supernova expands slower , but the emerging light is only slightly delayed and on the tail , the light curves are identical .",
    "[ fig : lite2 ] shows what happens if the magnetar is assumed to have a stronger magnetic field , @xmath8 = 0.5 and 0.7 .",
    "more of the rotational energy is deposited early on and contributes to the expansion rate .",
    "consequently the light curve at peak is fainter and it declines more rapidly .",
    "smaller initial rotation rates ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 erg corresponding to periods of 10 ms and 6.3 ms ) were employed , but the answer is not very sensitive to that . the extra energy would just accelerate the ejecta .",
    "since the resulting thin spherical shells are probably not physical , they are not considered here .",
    "erg explosion of a 7.29  wolf - rayet star .",
    "the embedded magnetar had a field strength of @xmath32 gauss and initial rotational energies of @xmath33 ( solid line ) and @xmath31 erg ( dotted line ) or @xmath34 gauss and @xmath31 erg ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the energy that would result from the decay of 0.3  of @xmath0ni .",
    "[ fig : lite2],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the light curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : lite2 ] resemble , superficially at least , that of sn 1998bw which accompanied grb 980425 @xcite .",
    "the long tails that in fact go like @xmath35 , parallel for some time that expected from the decay of @xmath0co and if the light curve for the first year was all one had to go by , one might easily confuse a pulsar - powered model for one powered by radioactivity . since the explosion energy and mechanism is left unspecified here , one could invoke a much higher kinetic energy ( accompanying the birth of the magnetar ? ) and obtain spectra like that seen in sn 1998bw . the light curve at peak would then be powered by a combination of radioactivity and pulsar emission .",
    "however , the luminosity of sn 1998bw at times later than one year @xcite argues against such a hybrid model . by 1000 days after the explosion",
    ", the supernova had declined to @xmath36 erg s@xmath12 , whereas a pulsar with field strength @xmath32 gauss would still be radiating @xmath37 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "in fact , a strict application of equation  [ eq : dipole ] would imply that the pulsar must have been born with a field strength in excess of @xmath38 gauss in order to satisfy the observational limit at late times , but then the magnetar would contribute all of its rotational energy to the explosion and none to the light curve .    of course equation  [ eq : dipole ] is an approximation whose validity can be questioned , especially at early times , and the magnetic field strength and orientation need not be constant with time .",
    "given the freedom to pick a field decay rate , the entire light curve could be fit , but this seems somewhat contrived . fitting the late time light curve with a combination of @xmath0co and",
    "@xmath39ni decay seems , for now , more natural @xcite .",
    "pulsars with magnetar - like magnetic fields can contribute appreciably to the light curves of type ib and ic supernovae .",
    "in fact , it would be surprising if they never did . for moderate field strengths ,",
    "the light curve is very luminous and long lasting and might be confused with those of pair - instability supernovae or circumstellar interaction .",
    "indeed , @xcite have suggested a pulsar as the possible source powering the second ( principal ) maximum of the light curve of sn 2005bf .",
    "if magnetars are the central engine that powers the long - soft class of gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then it is reasonable to expect that they may contribute to the light curves of the supernovae that accompany them . on the one hand",
    ", this might facilitate the magnetar paradigm because the production of the necessary large amount of @xmath0ni has proven problematic @xcite . having",
    "an alternate explanation that involves magnetar energy input would solve this problem .",
    "on the other hand , if a magnetar contribution to the light curve can be ruled out based on the spectrum and late time light curve , one must wonder how the magnetar is so effectively concealed .",
    "is the rotational energy extracted with such high efficiency in the first few seconds that the magnetar forever afterwards rotates slowly , or do rotating magnetars not emit according to the popular dipole formula during the first year ?",
    "perhaps they do not .",
    "the absence of a pulsar contribution to the luminosity of typical supernovae is easy to understand . a pulsar born with a 14 ms period ( 10@xmath40 erg )",
    ", would only have a pulsar luminosity of @xmath41 erg s during the time when it is bright .",
    "this is small compared with the 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath12 resulting from shock energy released by recombination ( type ii supernova ) or radioactivity ( type i supernova ) .",
    "but the extremely faint optical luminosity of sn 1987a , @xmath43 erg s@xmath12 seventeen years after its birth @xcite is very difficult to reconcile with any model with a young active pulsar .",
    "while dust extinction could be considerable , the lack of a point source in sn 1987a remains a mystery .",
