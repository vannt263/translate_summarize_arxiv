    "in recent years , a considerable effort has been devoted to extend the chaotic communication applications to the field of secure communications .",
    "the possibility of synchronization of two coupled chaotic systems was first shown by pecora and carrol @xcite and opened the possibility of using the signals generated by chaotic systems as carriers for analog and digital communications .",
    "this discovery soon aroused great interest as a potential means for secure communications @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a great number of cryptosystems based on chaos have been proposed @xcite , some of them fundamentally flawed by a lack of robustness and security @xcite .",
    "projective synchronization ( ps ) is an interesting phenomena firstly described by mainieri and rehacek @xcite , it consists in the synchronization of two partially linear coupled chaotic systems , master and slave , in which the amplitude of the slave system is a scalar multiple , called scaling factor , of that of the master system in the phase space .",
    "the original study was restricted to three - dimensional partially linear systems .",
    "later xu and li @xcite showed that ps could be extended to general classes of chaotic systems without partial linearity , by means of the feedback control of the slave system ; they illustrated the applicability to lorenz , chua and the hyperchaotic rssler systems .",
    "in a recent paper li and xu @xcite proposed a secure communication scheme based on ps chaotic masking .",
    "the authors claimed that the unpredictability of the scaling factor of the ps can additionally enhance the security of communications .",
    "furthermore , the authors proposed the use of an invertible function @xmath0 , in such a way that the transmitted ciphertext signal will be @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the variables of a three - dimensional chaotic system and @xmath4 is the plaintext ( which in their paper is assumed to be a sound signal ) .",
    "they claimed that the security of the information can also be guaranteed because the function @xmath0 could be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "they illustrated the feasibility of the scheme with two examples , based on the lorenz and the hyperchaotic rssler systems , respecitvely .    in this article",
    "we show that the proposed cryptosystem is insecure and how to break it in two different ways , by high - pass filtering and by generalized synchronization , for both examples based on the lorenz and the hyperchaotic rssler systems .    in @xcite , the first example",
    "is based on the following lorenz system : @xmath5 with parameter values @xmath6 .",
    "the transmitted signals from the sender to the receiver end are the shared scalar variable @xmath3 and the ciphertext @xmath1 $ ] , where the function @xmath0 was specified as @xmath7=y_1+m(t)$ ] .",
    "the second example is based on the hyperchaotic rssler system defined by the authors as : @xmath8 with parameter values @xmath9 . in this example , the transmitted signals from the sender to the receiver end are the shared scalar variable @xmath10 and the ciphertext @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath0 was specified as @xmath12=y_1+m(t)$ ] .",
    "although the authors seem to base the security of its communication system on the chaotic behavior of the output of a chaotic or hyperchaotic non - linear system , no analysis of security was included . instead , an unproved assertion saying that  the security of information can be guaranteed \" was given in the conclusion .",
    "the first issue to be considered is the key of the system .",
    "a cryptosystem can not exist without a key , otherwise , it might be considered as a coding system , but never regarded as a secure system . in @xcite it is not considered whether there should be a key in the proposed system , what it should consist of , what the available key space would be , and how it would be managed .    when cryptanalyzing a cryptosystem , the general assumption made is that the cryptanalyst knows exactly the design and working of the cryptosystem under study , i.e. , he knows every detail about the ciphering algorithm , except the secret key .",
    "this is an evident requirement in today s secure communications systems , usually referred to as kerchoff s principle @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was stated that the arbitrary selection of the function @xmath0 will warrant the information security . but according to the kerchoff s principle , the function @xmath0 must be publicly known and may not be considered part of the key . at most , its structure could contain some factors or constants whose values can play the role of secret key ; but , unfortunately , the authors of @xcite have not considered such possibility , nor which conditions the function @xmath0 might satisfy , nor how many usable functions there are , nor how much they can contribute to the system security .",
    "much care must be exercised when selecting the function @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise , choosing different functions might create different ciphertexts , that can be decrypted using the same algorithm though , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : recovery ] .",
    "it is supposed that chaotic masking is an adequate means for secure transmission , because chaotic systems present some properties as sensitive dependence on parameters and initial conditions , ergodicity , mixing , and dense periodic points .",
    "these properties make them similar to pseudorandom noise @xcite , which has been used traditionally as a masking signal for cryptographic purposes .",
    "a fundamental requirement of the pseudorandom noise used in cryptography is that its spectrum should be infinitely broad , flat and of much higher power density than the signal to be concealed . in other words",
    ", the plaintext power spectrum should be effectively buried into the pseudorandom noise power spectrum .",
    "the cryptosystem proposed in @xcite does not satisfy this condition . on the contrary ,",
    "the spectrum of the signal generated by the lorenz oscillator is of narrow band , decaying very fast with increasing frequency , showing a power density much lower than the plaintext at plaintext frequencies .        in @xcite",
    "the sound of a water flow was used as the plaintext message @xmath4 , but no details are given about its waveform or power spectrum . from (",
    "2 ) it can be appreciated that its amplitude is roughly @xmath13 . in our simulation",
    "we have used , instead , a well defined plaintext signal @xmath14 , which corresponds to a pure tone sound of 16.352 hz , which is the lowest note generated by a musical instrument , the @xmath15 of a 32 ft pipe of a pipe - organ @xcite and with the same peak amplitude of ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) , namely @xmath13 .",
    "figures  [ fig : lorenz](a ) and [ fig : rosler](a ) illustrate the logarithmic power spectra of the ciphertext when the lorenz attractor and the hyperchaotic rssler attractor are used as the chaotic system , respectively , with the same parameter values previously described .",
    "it can be seen that in both examples the plaintext signal clearly emerges at 16.352 hz over the background noise created by the lorenz and hyperchaotic rssler oscillators , with a power of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , relative to the maximum power of the ciphertext spectrum , while the power density of the ciphertext , at neighboring frequencies , falls below @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .        to recover the plaintext",
    "we did not use a chaotic receiver , instead the ciphertext was high - pass filtered .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lorenz](b ) and [ fig : rosler](b ) .",
    "the filter employed was a finite impulse response one . to avoid phase nonlinearities and distortion ,",
    "it was constructed with a 512-coefficient hamming window , with a cutoff frequency of 13 hz .",
    "the result is a good estimation of the plaintext after a short initial transient of approximately 0.3 seconds for the lorenz system .",
    "note that this is the hardest case an attacker can face from the point of view of plaintext frequency , because for higher sound frequencies the spectrum of the background noise created by the lorenz oscillator is even lower . while for the hyperchaotic rssler system the result is a perfect recovery after a short initial transient of approximately 0.1 seconds .",
    "the former attack method works only for plaintext frequencies higher than the 13 hz cut - off frequency of the high - pass filter employed . for very low plaintext frequencies the noise created by the chaotic oscillators effectively masks the plaintext , preventing its retrieval by direct high - pass filtering .",
    "but plaintext signals of very low frequency may be still retrieved if we know what kind of non - linear time - varying system was used for encryption , but without the knowledge of its parameter and initial condition values . to show such a possibility we have implemented two cryptanalysis procedures based on generalized synchronization @xcite .      to break the ps - based chaotic masking scheme under study , using the lorenz system , we use the following intruder receiver : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the intruder receiver s lorenz system parameters and @xmath22 is the instantaneous value of the recovery error @xmath23 . the terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 work as feedback of the recovery error , in order to achieve generalized synchronization between sender and receiver ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are two scalars that may accept a wide range of values , from 1 to more than 400 , and even one of them alone may not exist . the synchronism is achieved for any combination of @xmath26 and @xmath27 values , but the amplitudes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 do not match with those of @xmath30 and @xmath31 while @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",

    "once the correct values @xmath58 are found , the term @xmath59 vanishes and the recovery error is just equal to the plaintext signal @xmath4 .",
    "the search of the correct parameter values @xmath21 can be done in the following way : first , select an initial value for @xmath45 centered in its usable range ; second , vary the value of @xmath39 until a minimum error is reached ; third , keep this value and vary the value of @xmath45 until a new minimum error is reached ; four , check if the remaining error @xmath22 is a clean recognizable plaintext , if not repeat the second and third steps .",

    "in summary , the proposed ps - based chaotic masking cryptosystem is rather weak , since it can be broken in two easy ways , the first one being ignorant of the transmitter precise structure and the second one knowing the transmitter structure but ignoring its parameter values .",
