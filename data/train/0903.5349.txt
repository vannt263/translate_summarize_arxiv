    "foams , which are dispersions of densely packed gas bubbles in a liquid , exhibit an intricate mix of elastic , plastic and viscous behavior reminiscent of the mechanics of other disordered materials such as colloidal suspensions , granular media and emulsions @xcite . when left unperturbed , foams jam into a meta - stable state where surface tension provides the restoring force underlying their elastic response for small strains @xcite . under continuous driving the foam starts to flow , and the viscous dissipation that arises in the thin fluid films that surround the gas bubbles becomes important .",
    "macroscopically , the steady state rheology of foams exhibits shear thinning , and the stress @xmath13 as function of strain rate @xmath14 is generally non - linear , often taking a herschel - bulkley form : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the yield stress , and where the viscous stress @xmath17 scales nontrivially with the strain rate @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in addition , in many situations , the flow is inhomogeneous and localizes in a shear band @xcite .    in an earlier letter",
    "@xcite we experimentally probed the flow of disordered , bidisperse 2d foams which are trapped between the fluid phase and a top - plate .",
    "the 2d nature allows for direct imaging of the bubble dynamics and of the shear banded flow profiles in this system . combining measurements of the flow profiles with rheological measurements , we established that viscous interactions between neighboring bubbles scale differently with velocity gradients than the effective viscous interactions at the global scale .",
    "we captured the rate - dependent shear banding exhibited by our system in a nonlinear drag force balance model . here",
    "we expand on these findings , discuss new results for the effect of varying the wetness of the foam , and provide extensive additional evidence to support our main conclusions .    to understand the rheology and shear band formation in our system , three ingredients need to be described and combined appropriately : _",

    "( ii ) _ local bubble interactions . _ ( iii ) _ disorder .    _ top plate  _ in recent years , a variety of studies have addressed the formation of shear bands in ( quasi ) two - dimensional foams , consisting of a single layer of macroscopic bubbles .",
    "such single layers can be made by freely floating the bubbles on the surface of a surfactant solution (  bubble raft  ) @xcite , by trapping them between a top glass plate and the surfactant solution (  liquid - glass  ) @xcite , or by trapping them between two parallel glass plates ( hele - shaw cell ) @xcite .    in a seminal paper by debrgeas et al .",
    "@xcite , a bidisperse foam in hele - shaw couette cell was sheared and narrow shear banded flow profiles where obtained @xcite . while initially it was believed that for slow flows , the effect of the viscous drag forces exerted by the confining glass plates would be negligible @xcite , these drag forces have turned out to be crucial .",
    "first , couette experiments in bubble rafts found completely smooth flow behavior @xcite .",
    "second , in experiments where a monodisperse foam was linearly sheared with and without confining glass plate on top @xcite , one observes smooth velocity profiles for the bubble raft but highly shear banded flows for the liquid - glass geometry . the precise connection between the drag forces due to the confining plates and the occurrence of shear banding in confined foams is still a subject of debate @xcite .    a simple continuum model that balances the top plate drags and the inter - bubble drags ( modeled with a bingham constitutive relation ) captures both the rate independence and exponentially localized shear bands seen in the linear liquid - glass cell @xcite  here we will build on and extend this model to capture the experimentally observed nonlinear , rate dependent rheology of disordered foams .    _ local interactions  _ at the microscopic level , bubble interactions are a combination of elastic repulsion , typically harmonic for small deformations @xcite , and nonlinear viscous drag forces @xcite .",
    "such drag forces arise when two bubbles slide past each other or when a bubble slides past a solid boundary .",
    "the viscous drag forces originate in the thin films that surround foam bubbles , and have recently received renewed attention @xcite . already for a single bubble sliding past a solid wall",
    ", bretherton showed that the drag force scales nonlinearly with the bubble velocity @xcite , and by analogy one would expect the drag forces arising between sliding bubbles to be nonlinear also  indeed denkov et al .",
    "recently suggested that a similar scaling applies to the viscous drag force between bubbles @xcite .",
    "here we measure these drag forces directly by rheological experiments where two rows of ordered bubbles are sheared past each other .",
    "_ disorder  _ foam flows are disordered and intermittent at the multi - bubble scale @xcite . for such disordered systems , the affine approach , where one simply scales up local elastic or viscous interactions , often fails to describe the macroscopic behavior  this is by now well established for shear deformations in granular and foam - like systems @xcite , and a similar picture is emerging from simulations of the flow of viscous particles @xcite . in the present work we present strong experimental evidence for the failure of the affine approach to describe drag forces in flowing systems .      in this paper",

    "we capture our findings in a model in which the time - averaged drag forces between bubble and top plate , @xmath19 , and between neighboring bubbles , @xmath20 are balanced .",

    "we find the averaged drag forces in the disordered foam to scale _ differently _ from the local drag forces between individual bubbles , which we have measured at high resolution and analyze in a novel way .",
    "in contrast , for monodisperse , ordered foams the local , averaged and top - plate drag forces all scale similarly , causing rate - independent flows similar to those seen by wang et al .",

    "we further probe the connection between the viscous drag forces at the bubble scale and the bulk viscous forces by performing additional linear shear experiments over a range of packing ( air ) fractions @xmath9 .",
    "we find that the contribution of averaged bubble - bubble drag forces vanishes algebraically as @xmath21 , when the packing fraction is decreased towards a critical value @xmath22 , which we identify with the ( un)jamming density  @xmath23 .",
    "we relate the vanishing of the averaged bubble - bubble drag forces at @xmath22 to the vanishing overlap between bubbles at unjamming .",

    "1 shows our experimental setup : the bubbles are contained inside an aluminum frame ( 400x230 mm ) which is leveled with the liquid surface and which supports glass top plates to which the bubbles bridge once they are in place .",
    "the top plates consist of three adjacent glass plates with slits to accommodate two pmma wheels of radius 195 mm and thickness 9.5 mm which drive the flow .",
    "the vertical gap between the liquid surface and the glass plates can be varied to control the packing fraction of bubbles @xmath9 .",
    "the wheels , which are grooved to provide a no - slip boundary for the bubbles , can be lowered into and raised out of the bath through the slits .",
    "the wheels are connected to two lin engineering stepper motors , each driven by micro - stepping driver , and are rotated in opposite directions . at any point along the line where the wheels contact the foam bubbles the horizontal component of the driving velocity is a constant ( see fig .",
    "we obtain our data from the central 60 mm of the shearing region  marked by the horizontal lines in fig .",

    "do leave the system , while being pinned to the wheels .",
    "this does not result in holes in the foam layer , either because at high driving velocities the bubbles reenter the system before rupturing while traveling on the wheel , or because at low velocities bubbles from outside the shearing region are pushed inwards due to the bubble surplus at the edges .",
    "the resulting driving velocity gives rise to a global strain rate @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the gap between the wheels , which we vary between 5 and 10 cm .",

    "the average velocity profiles are obtained from a series of images which we record with an 8 bit foculus bw 432 ccd camera ( 1280x1024 pixels ) equipped with a tamron 28 - 300 telezoom objective . in the images , 1",
    "pixel corresponds to approximately 0.1 mm . to optimize the brightness and obtain images in which the bubbles appear as circles , the foam is lit laterally by two fluorescent tubes , each driven by high frequency ballasts to prevent flickering in the images",
    "the bottom of the reservoir is covered with a black plate to improve contrast .",
    "typical images are shown in fig .",
    "[ image ] .",
    "the frame rate is fixed such that the displacement at the wheels is fixed at 0.15 mm between frames . since the flow is strongly intermittent , with large fluctuations in the bubble displacements , we take 1000 frames per run , corresponding to a strain of 4 for a 5 cm gap , as we are interested in averaged velocity profiles .",
    "we pre - shear the system before taking data , so that a steady state is reached .",
    "we obtain the velocity profiles both through particle tracking and a particle image velocimetry - like technique , where for each @xmath33-value , we calculate the cross - correlation @xmath34 between the corresponding image line in the @xmath35 of length @xmath36 and the same image line @xmath37 in the next frame shifted by an amount @xmath13 : @xmath38    we can then proceed in two ways .",
    "the first method is to add up all cross - correlations from all frames for each @xmath33-value , and calculate the average displacement @xmath39 per frame by fitting a parabola @xmath40 to the resulting sum of cross - correlations and taking the peak value of that parabola : @xmath41 in the second method we fit a parabola to each cross - correlation separately and obtain the average displacement by averaging the maxima of all individual parabolas : @xmath42    by comparing to average velocity profiles obtained by particle tracking @xcite , we find that the latter procedure gives the closest match to the tracking velocity profiles , and we have employed this procedure throughout .",
    "we thus obtain both spatially ( in the @xmath32-direction ) and temporally averaged velocity profiles . despite the intermittent character of the flow , we obtain smooth reproducible velocity profiles .      to characterize the amount of coarsening we measure the bubble size distribution by measuring the surface area of the bubbles in the images .",
    "we obtain well defined size distributions which show little coarsening over the duration of the runs , which corresponds to about 2 hours ( fig .",
    "3a ) .",
    "we have checked that the drag on the foam bubbles due to flow of the bulk liquid underneath is negligible by measuring the velocity profile of bubbles floating on a very shallow layer of bulk fluid . in this case",
    "the fluid surface velocity is decreased due to the no - slip boundary condition at the reservoirs bottom .",
    "we do not , within experimental uncertainty , observe a change in the experimental velocity profiles in this geometry .",
    "we furthermore measure the velocity profile of the liquid surface itself at the same fluid level as in the foam experiments by imaging the flow of silver particles that were sprinkled on the liquid surface , see fig .",
    "[ bulkflow]b .",
    "we observe a steeply decreasing velocity profile at the fluid surface , which implies that even if the fluid drag were of the order of the other drags acting on the bubbles , it would not significantly alter the flow profiles except near the wheels .    we thus conclude that the bubble size distribution is essentially constant during an experimental time frame , and that the dominant drag forces are those between bubbles and top plate , and those between contacting bubbles .",
    "in this section we explore the rate dependent shear flows in our system experimentally . by fitting our experimental data to a nonlinear drag force balance model",
    ", we deduce the dependence of the averaged bubble - bubble and bubble - wall drag forces as function of the local strain rate and velocity .",
    "we measure averaged velocity profiles in disordered twodimensional foams .",
    "these foams are produced by bubbling a fixed flow rate of nitrogen through syringe needles of 2 different inner diameters , such that bubbles of 1.8 @xmath43 and 2.7 @xmath44 mm result ( at 59 - 41 number ratio ) .",
    "the bubbles are gently mixed with a spoon until a disordered monolayer results . for gap widths of 5 , 7 and 9 cm",

    "note that we perform the sweep in driving velocities from fast to slow and that we pre - shear the system for one full wheel rotation , to start with bubbles covering the wheel @xcite and ensure that we have reached a steady state . to fix the packing fraction , we fix the gap between glass plate and liquid surface at 2.25 @xmath25  0.01 mm .",
    "we have measured ( see section vi ) that for this gap the packing fraction is @xmath46 .",
    "results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ ratedep](a - c ) : the profiles exhibit shear banding , and for all gap widths the profiles become increasingly shear banded at increasing driving velocities . the slowest runs at @xmath28 = 5 cm yield essentially linear velocity profiles .",
    "we suggest that these shapes are due to the small gap width , which results in overlapping shear banded profiles resembling a linear profile , and in what follows , we will present a model that supports this conclusion .    in fig .",
    "[ ratedep](d ) we plot velocity profiles for a driving velocity of 0.26 mm / s for all three gap widths together , which clearly show that for all widths , the velocity profiles decay similarly .",
    "[ ratedep](d ) thus suggests that in this experiment the driving velocity at the edges , instead of the overall shear , sets the velocity profiles , and that the local response to forcing will provide the key towards understanding the shape of these profiles .",
    "note finally that the profiles do not exhibit significant slip with respect to shearing wheels , except for the fastest runs , where the slip is less than 20 % .",
    "we now propose a model to account for the shear banding behavior discussed above , by considering the balance of the averaged viscous drag forces .",
    "the drag force on a single bubble that slides past a solid wall was first investigated by bretherton @xcite and has recently received renewed attention @xcite .",

    "closely connected , is our scenario an example of a general route by which aspects of the ubiquitous herschel - bulkley ( power law ) rheology observed for a wide range of disordered materials can be rationalized ?",
    "second , how robust are our experimental results ?",
    "for example , would similar flows in hele - shaw cells behave differently , as suggested by the results of debrgeas @xcite ? we also wonder if our model is able to capture shear banded flows in couette geometries , where the curvature plays an important role , in particular since the foam has a finite flow threshold @xcite .",
    "third , can similar phenomena and models as described here be extended to three dimensional flows of foams and emulsions  where flows in the latter can be captured by confocal imaging and mri @xcite ?",

    "another measure that has been derived in @xcite relates the measured length of the deformed facets of the bubbles just before a t1 event to @xmath9 . in our experiments , though , it is not clear how the occurrence of t1-events can precisely be defined , since there is no obvious separation of the deformation scales during and outside of a t1-event .",

    "<S> we probe the flow of two dimensional foams , consisting of a monolayer of bubbles sandwiched between a liquid bath and glass plate , as a function of driving rate , packing fraction and degree of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find that bidisperse , disordered foams exhibit strongly rate dependent and inhomogeneous ( shear banded ) velocity profiles , while monodisperse , ordered foams are also shear banded , but essentially rate independent . </S>",
    "<S> second , we introduce a simple model based on balancing the averaged drag forces between the bubbles and the top plate , @xmath0 and the averaged bubble - bubble drag forces @xmath1 , and assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote average bubble velocities and gradients . </S>",
    "<S> this model captures the observed rate dependent flows for @xmath6 , and the rate independent flows for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> third , we perform independent rheological measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , both for ordered and disordered systems , and find these to be fully consistent with the forms assumed in the simple model . </S>",
    "<S> disorder thus modifies the exponent @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , we vary the packing fraction @xmath9 of the foam over a substantial range , and find that the flow profiles become increasingly shear banded when the foam is made wetter . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , our model describes flow profiles and rate dependence over the whole range of packing fractions with the same power law exponents  only a dimensionless number @xmath10 which measures the ratio of the pre - factors of the viscous drag laws is seen to vary with packing fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , corresponding to the 2d jamming density , and suggest that this scaling follows from the geometry of the deformed facets between bubbles in contact . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our work shows that the presence of disorder qualitatively changes the effective bubble - bubble drag forces , and suggests a route to rationalize aspects of the ubiquitous herschel - bulkley ( power law ) rheology observed in a wide range of disordered materials . </S>"
