    "lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) is a space mission of nasa and esa which aims at detecting low frequency gravitational waves .",
    "lisa will consist in a constellation of three spacecraft occupying the vertexes of an equilateral triangle of side 5 million kilometers .",
    "the barycenter of the constellation will orbit around the sun following a quasi - circular orbit inclined @xmath0 with respect to the ecliptic , and trailing the earth by some @xmath1 .",
    "each of the spacecraft harbors two proof masses , carefully protected against external disturbances such as solar radiation pressure and charged particles , which ensures they are in nominal free - fall in the interplanetary gravitational field .",
    "gravitational waves show up as differential accelerations between pairs of proof masses , and the main aim of lisa is to measure such acceleration using laser interferometry .",
    "the interested reader is referred to  @xcite and  @xcite for more extensive information .",
    "the technologies required for the lisa mission are many and challenging .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that some flight hardware can not be tested on ground , led esa to frame within its scientific program a technology demonstrator to test the required critical technologies in a flight environment .",
    "its launch is expected towards early 2014 .",
    "the basic goal of lisa pathfinder consists in measuring to the highest possible accuracy the acceleration noise of two test masses 35 centimeters away , and to keep this noise below a certain limit  @xcite .",
    "the payload on board lisa pathfinder is called the lisa technology package ( ltp )  @xcite .",
    "its main components are the two gravitational reference sensors ( grss )  shown as the two large vertical cylinders in figure  [ fig.ltp ]  and the optical metrology system ( oms )  which is an interferometer placed on the horizontal platform between them .",
    "the grs consists in a set of electrodes aimed to determine the position of a test mass with respect to the spacecraft to nanometer precision , using capacitance measurements .",
    "the oms provides picometer precision measurements of the relative position of two test masses . using these measurements , a set of micro - thrusters",
    " field emission electric propulsion ( feep )  relocate the spacecraft so that the test mass preserves a free fall motion . in the same figure  [ fig.ltp ] , the location of two induction coils can be observed .",
    "the coils will be used to generate a controlled magnetic field within the volume of the ltp core assembly ( lca ) in such a way that the magnetic characteristics of the test masses can be determined . at the same time",
    ", the magnetic field inside the lca will be measured by a set of four tri - axial fluxgate magnetometers ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "all these pieces of hardware constitute the magnetic diagnostic subsystem . finally , the data management unit ( dmu ) is in charge of commanding and acquiring signals from all the mentioned subsystems .",
    "magnetic noise in the ltp can be a significant part of the total readout noise , 1.2@xmath210@xmath3ms@xmath4hz@xmath5 out of 3.0@xmath210@xmath3ms@xmath4hz@xmath5 is the allocated maximum acceleration magnetic noise budget .",
    "this noise occurs because the residual magnetization and susceptibility of the proof masses couple with a surrounding magnetic field , giving rise to a force @xcite :    @xmath6{\\bf b }             \\right\\rangle v\\ , ,   \\label{eq.1}\\ ] ]    and a torque :    @xmath7   \\right\\rangle v   \\label{eq.1n}\\ ] ]    in these expressions * b * is the magnetic field in the test mass , * m * stands for the magnetization of the test mass , @xmath8 is the volume of the test mass , @xmath9 is its magnetic susceptibility , @xmath10 is the vacuum magnetic constant , and * r * denotes the distance to the center of the test mass .",
    "finally , the notation @xmath11 refers to the volume average of the enclosed quantity .",
    "thus , to estimate and ultimately subtract the acceleration noise due to the magnetic interactions , the magnetic properties of the test masses must be determined .    in this paper",
    "we describe the experimental setup and the data analysis needed to infer the values of the magnetic properties of the test masses on board the ltp , and we assess the feasibility of obtaining the magnetic characteristics of the test masses with good accuracy .",
    "specifically , we present a set of simulations aimed at evaluating the response of the ltp hardware ( coils and test masses ) and control architecture ( drag free controllers and low frequency suspension controllers ) when a controlled magnetic field is applied .",
    "we will show that using this procedure , both the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility of the proof masses can be determined to the desired accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : experiment ] , we describe the main elements of the experimental setup .",
    "section [ sec : forces ] is devoted to compute the forces and torques acting on the test masses .",
    "it follows section [ sec : noisesources ] , where the different noise sources perturbing the experiment are presented .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : results ] we present our results , whereas in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main findings and we present our conclusions .",
    "as mentioned , the basic approach to determine the magnetic properties of the test masses is to inject a controlled signal with the onboard coils and to study the dynamics of the proof masses .",
    "the two test masses are located at the center of each inertial sensor , and are the end mirrors of the oms .",
    "in fact , one of the test masses will be the reference free floating body to perform the translation control of the spacecraft .",
    "the test masses are made of an alloy of pt ( 27% ) and au ( 73% ) , their dimensions are @xmath12 mm and their weight is 1.95 kg . to comply with the top science requirements ,",
    "the test masses must have certain properties .",
    "for the purpose of the present paper the two most important ones are the magnetic moment and the susceptibility , which must be , respectively , @xmath13  a  m@xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the volume of the test masses is @xmath16  m@xmath17 .",
    "the density of magnetic moment has to be then @xmath18  a / m .        the controlled magnetic field will be produced by the onboard coils , which are placed next to each of the grs towers  see fig .",
    "[ fig.ltp ] .",
    "the two circular induction coils are made of a titanium alloy ( @xmath19 ) , have @xmath20 2400 windings of radius @xmath21 mm .",
    "they are placed 85.5 mm away from the center of the respective test mass .",
    "the onboard coils are aligned with the @xmath22-axis of the test masses , thus , the magnetic field within the volume of the test masses has axial symmetry , see fig .  [ fig.coils ] .",
    "if the current fed to the coils is @xmath23 , the resulting magnetic field ( and its gradient ) will oscillate at the same frequency .",
    "thus , when the coils are switched on the test masses rotate and are displaced from their equilibrium positions .",
    "typical values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , 1  ma and 1  mhz .    compared to other missions ,",
    "ltp is a very flexible instrument in terms of the possible operation scenarios .",
    "nevertheless , we characterize the magnetic experiment for a fixed operating mode , the main science mode  @xcite .",
    "this mode is a full 3-dimensional dynamical mode and it is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.control ] .",
    "@xmath26 is a dynamical matrix which represents the dynamic response of the spacecraft and the test masses when they are affected by specific forces ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this block consists of an 18 degree - of - freedom representation of the motion of these 3 bodies .",
    "the differential position of the test masses and their distance to the spacecraft are represented by @xmath28 in this block - diagram .",
    "the ltp is endowed with two different mechanisms to detect the motion and the actual position of the test masses .",
    "the first one is the interferometer , while the second is the electrode housing of each of the two gravitational reference sensors .",
    "the oms in ltp is in charge of measuring the distance between one of the test masses and the optical bench , thus giving an absolute reference , and also the distance between both test masses , providing a differential reading . due to its ability to perform wavefront sensing , the rotation angles of the test mass around the @xmath29- ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31-axis ( @xmath32 ) can also be measured ( the @xmath29- and @xmath31-axis in the test mass coordinate frame are the same axis represented in fig .  [ fig.coils ] but centered at the test mass ) .",
    "the displacements are expected to be measured with a picometer accuracy while the rotation angles can be measured with an accuracy of @xmath33 nrad  @xcite .",
    "the electrode housing can also be used to determine the position of the test masses .",
    "however , this mechanism only offers readings with nanometer precision .",
    "consequently , for our application only the readings of the interferometer will be used .",
    "the physical model of these sensing mechanisms is included in @xmath34 , the sensing matrix ( figure [ fig.control ] ) .",
    "@xmath35 is the readout noise of the different sensors and @xmath36 the actual measure delivered to the controller",
    ".     stands for the dynamical matrix , @xmath37 represents the sensing matrix of the interferometer , i.e. the matrix translating the position of the test mass , @xmath28 , into the interferometer readout , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 stands for the readout noise ) .",
    "@xmath40 represents the physics of the feeps and the electrostatic actuators , and finally @xmath41 , is the controller matrix , implementing the drag free and low - frequency control loops .",
    "@xmath42 represents the displacement guidance signals .",
    "@xmath43 are the actuators noise and @xmath44 are the output forces of the actuators .",
    "@xmath45 are the magnetic forces induced by the coils and @xmath46 are the environment force noises disturbing the spacecraft.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    these kinematic measurements are processed by the controller block ( @xmath47 ) and a feedback action is produced on the ltp dynamics by the actuators ( @xmath40 ) : the micropropulsion thrusters and the electrostatic actuators .",
    "they produce an additional set of forces ( @xmath48 ) with the following objectives . the drag free controller acts on the spacecraft using the micropropulsion thrusters and forces it to follow test mass 1 .",
    "the electrostatic actuators act on test mass 2 using the low frequency suspension , a specific control loop of very low gain in the ltp measurement bandwidth , that allows to control in band the differential acceleration between both test masses at the same time , avoiding secular drifts or stray motions of the second test mass .",
    "finally , @xmath49 represents the force noise on the test masses , and @xmath45 represents the forces acting on the test masses due to the magnetic field created by the coils .",
    "the complete control architecture can be expressed by the following system of equations :    @xmath50    where all the symbols have been already defined with the only exception of @xmath51 which represents the displacement guidance signals of the experiment and @xmath52 which are the actuators noise . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq.control ] ) , we can calculate the transfer function from the magnetic forces ( @xmath53 ) to the interferometer readings ( @xmath36 ) , which turns out to be :    @xmath54    this transfer function characterizes the projection of the magnetic forces / torques into kinematic motion of the test masses .",
    "the controllers have been designed to deliver very sensitive readings of the differential motion of both test masses between 1mhz and 30mhz , the measurement bandwidth of the ltp mission . for simplicity , if we consider only the one - dimensional model :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the stiffness parameters coupling the motion of each test mass to the motion of the spacecraft , @xmath58 is the interferometer channel crosscoupling . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the drag free and the low frequency suspension controller transfer functions respectively and , finally , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the physical models for the feep thrusters and the electrostatic actuators .",
    "using eq .  ( [ eq.1 ] ) and neglecting the environmental field ( which is much smaller than the applied field , 500 nt ) , the @xmath22-component of the force acting on the test mass is    @xmath63     and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for this specific example",
    "we have adopted @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( a random orientation of the maximum * m * ) and @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath24 is 1ma and @xmath25 is 1mhz .",
    "the @xmath22-component of the force is shown as a solid black line , whereas the @xmath29-component is displayed as a dashed - dotted red line and the @xmath31-component is displayed as dashed green line.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    where * b*@xmath71 is the field produced by the coils .",
    "thus , since @xmath72 , the linear acceleration of the test masses has two separate frequencies , one at @xmath25 and the other one at @xmath73 , and also a dc component . the force on test mass 1 is plotted in figure [ fig.force ] .",
    "the torque acting on the test mass also has a similar behavior .",
    "however , it must be noted that , because of the symmetry of the applied magnetic field , the torque only has one frequency component :    @xmath74    \\right\\rangle v\\,\\sin\\omega t   \\label{eq.torques}\\ ] ]    the resulting torques are displayed in figure [ fig.torque ] .",
    "it is important to realize that only the @xmath29- and @xmath31-components of the torque can be measured with the interferometer , as @xmath75 produces a rotation around the direction of the laser beam .",
    "moreover , decomposing eqs .",
    "( [ eq.forces ] ) and ( [ eq.torques ] ) , it is easy to show that the @xmath22-component of the force on the test mass ( which can be obtained from its displacement ) and the @xmath29- and @xmath31-components of the torque ( which can be obtained from the rotation angles ) can be cast in the form :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is a constant function , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 oscillate at @xmath25 and @xmath81 oscillates at @xmath73 .",
    "hence , @xmath82 and @xmath83 will be used to estimate @xmath66 and @xmath65 , respectively , while the differential displacement of the test masses will be used to measure @xmath64 and  @xmath9 .    .",
    "the @xmath22- , @xmath29- and @xmath31-components of the torque are shown using black solid , red dashed - dotted and green dashed lines , respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the forces and torques shown in figures [ fig.force ] and [ fig.torque ] correspond to an ideal case . however , the real forces and torques acting on the test masses will not be noise - free .",
    "additionally , the outputs detected by the interferometer will also be affected by several noise sources .",
    "thus , to assess the feasibility of the experiment we need to model the noise sources .",
    "this is precisely the aim of this section .",
    "the stability of the magnetic field ( @xmath84 ) produced by the coils at the position of the test masses and its gradient ( @xmath85 ) must be , respectively , better than 5  nt  hz@xmath5 and 12  nt  m@xmath86  hz  @xmath5 @xcite within the measurement bandwidth ( 1  mhz @xmath87 30  mhz ) .",
    "this can be translated into a requirement on the stability of the injected current .",
    "it turns out that the requirement on the magnetic field gradient is the more demanding one , and using ampere s law it is straightforward to show that it is equivalent to a current fluctuation ( @xmath88 ) requirement of 110  na  hz@xmath5 within the measurement bandwidth .        in figure  [ fig.curr.source ]",
    ", we show a block diagram of the different hardware stages used to produce the current that feeds the coils .",
    "this block diagram has two parts : a digital - to - analog processing stage and an analog processing stage .",
    "the first block contains two digital - to - analog converters ( dac ) , followed by transresistance amplifiers ( i / v ) delivering low impedance output voltages .",
    "the first dac sets the reference voltage of the second dac and thus the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal current applied to the coil .",
    "the second one is configured with bipolar operation to generate the quantized signal with the previously selected amplitude . in the analog processing block",
    "the signal is low - pass - filtered and amplified with a howland current source  @xcite .",
    "finally , a switch is used to select one of the three possible states : short - circuit , open - circuit or connected .",
    "the noise of the current source chain for a dc signal , @xmath89 , can be written as :    @xmath90^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath91 is the noise density of the voltage reference and the first dac , @xmath92 is the noise density of the transimpedance amplifier and the second dac , @xmath93 is the noise density of the transimpedance amplifier , low - pass filter and howland current source , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are , respectively , the gains in the the second and third stages . the noise density of the first stage can be obtained as a contribution of the first dac , @xmath96 , and of the reference voltage , @xmath97 . however , the noise contribution of the first dac is negligible with respect to that of the reference source , @xmath98 . thus , if the dac works at its full scale , @xmath99 .",
    "likewise , @xmath92 can be computed as a combination of two different sources @xmath100 and @xmath101 , being @xmath100 the noise density of the second dac and @xmath102 that of the transresistance amplifiers , and finally @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are , respectively , the noise densities of the low - pass filter and of the howland current source .",
    "these noise sources have been measured for a dc current of 1  ma .",
    "the values obtained are @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the details of how these measurements were done are out of the scope of this paper and will be provided elsewhere .",
    "however , we mention that although the previous analysis has been performed for dc currents , when we operate at 1  mhz the dominant noise source is the quantization noise of the second dac .",
    "this means that the total current noise can be modeled as :    @xmath109^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where the sole contributor is the quantization noise of the second stage , and thus the total noise assuming an uniform quantization and a signal amplitude greater than a quantization step is given by :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the sampling frequency , @xmath112 is the number of bits of the onboard hardware , and the rest of the symbols have been already defined .",
    "the dmu delivers the output at a rate of 1024 samples per cycle .",
    "thus , the 1  mhz sinusoidal signal will be sampled at a frequency @xmath113hz .",
    "since the highest sinusoidal current used in the experiment will be 1ma , the highest noise will be 2.22  @xmath114 .",
    "this noise is 2 orders of magnitude larger than all other contributions and therefore will be the dominant noise .",
    "figure [ fig.accurrentstability ] shows the current noise for coil 1 for a signal of 1mhz and 1ma ( which are the nominal values of the experiment ) . as can be seen , the quantization noise level is above the dc current stability requirement for the mission ( dashed green line ) but , as it will be shown below , it is still sufficiently small to allow a reliable estimation of the magnetic properties of the test masses",
    ". it is also interesting to note that the quantization noise ( thus the total noise ) can be reduced when a 16-bit dac is used  see eq .",
    "( [ quant ] ) .",
    "finally , note that our theoretical results nicely match the experimental results .",
    "sinusoidal current of 1  @xmath115 nominal frequency .",
    "the dotted blue line shows the measured noise density , whereas the solid black line is our theoretical estimate ( see text for details ) .",
    "the green dashed line represents the dc current fluctuations requirement.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      so far we have discussed the noise density of the onboard coils .",
    "however , the different electronic subsystems of the satellite produce magnetic fields , which are also noisy . the magnetic noise produced by these subsystems ( @xmath116 )",
    "has been modeled considering the fluctuating values of their magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "the expected displacement noise spectral density at the positions of the test masses due to the magnetic field generated by several electronic boxes is 3 @xmath2 10@xmath117 m  hz@xmath5 at 1mhz .",
    "other noise sources that affect the measurements are the readout noise of the oms , the noise induced by the grs and that of the star tracker .",
    "as already mentioned , we only use the readings of the interferometer .",
    "however , the control chain uses the readings of the inertial sensors and of the star tracker to stabilize the drag free motion and the satellite attitude .",
    "therefore , both the grs and the star tracker affect the readings of the oms , and must be considered .",
    "the dominant noise is the readout noise in displacement of the interferometer . we model it using a two pole / two zero noise shape filter  @xcite :    @xmath118    at the positions of the test masses this results in a low frequency displacement noise of around 5 @xmath2 10@xmath117  m  hz@xmath5 at 1mhz but it is the largest contributor at high frequency .",
    "the actuators are also a relevant noise source at low frequencies .",
    "this noise is due to the capacitive actuators and the feep thrusters which have to ensure the free fall motion of the test mass .",
    "the micro - propulsion system of lisa pathfinder is composed of 12 feep thrusters .",
    "the force noise of each individual thruster is modeled as  @xcite :    @xmath119    their contribution in the differential readout channel is around 2 @xmath2 10@xmath120 m  hz@xmath5 at 1mhz , and it is somewhat larger on the absolute channel ( which provides the distance from test mass 1 to the spacecraft ) where the feep thrusters are the main disturbance source  @xcite .",
    "solar and infrared disturbances have been also modeled .",
    "solar disturbances are due to the solar flux impacting on the surfaces of the spacecraft .",
    "infrared disturbances are due to the infrared emission from the spacecraft external surfaces .",
    "these two noise sources are the most important contributors of disturbance on the spacecraft coordinates but they are highly attenuated by the control architecture and they turn out to be completely negligible in the interferometer readings .",
    "finally , the test mass disturbance noise represent the internal disturbances at the test mass coordinates .",
    "they are expected to be the most relevant sources at low frequency on the interferometer readings and their contribution has been estimated to be @xmath121  m  hz@xmath5 at 1  mhz .",
    "all these sources of noise affect the quality of the estimate of the magnetic properties of the test masses , as it will be shown below .",
    "we have estimated the magnetic properties of the test masses using the readings provided by the mission telemetry .",
    "the telemetry corresponding to the magnetic experiments will consist of the commands sent to the coils , the displacement readings of the interferometer ( namely , the absolute and differential readings ) and the wavefront rotation readings about the @xmath29- ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31- axes ( @xmath32 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that the stiffness of the test masses , the actuators gains and the interferometer crosscoupling factors have already been determined  @xcite .",
    "the simulated displacements and rotations measured by the onboard interferometer are displayed in figure [ fig.displacement ] .",
    "these displacements and rotations have been obtained integrating the equations of motion of a rigid solid , and including the drag free and low frequency controllers  see sect .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] . note that the problem has 18 degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , each of the two test masses has 6 degrees of freedom , and the spacecraft also has 6 degrees of freedom .",
    "the closed loop simulation is performed with appropriate simulation tools that will be used for mission operations  @xcite . as can be seen ,",
    "the displacements of the test masses are below 8 nm , while in permanent regime the corresponding rotations have amplitudes of @xmath122rad .",
    "the very long transient of about 3000s of the rotation excusions  see the bottom panel of figure [ fig.displacement ]  is due to the effect of the low - frequency controller .",
    "this controller is designed to avoid drift excursions of the test masses with frequencies smaller than 1mhz .",
    "consequently , the transient is very long . a similar transient ,",
    "although less evident , is present in the differential reading  see the top panel of figure [ fig.displacement ] .",
    "the reading of the displacement channel has two frequency components , @xmath25 and @xmath73 , however , these components are difficult to see in the time series shown in figure  [ fig.displacement ] .",
    "additionally , these two components are not in phase with the forces shown in figure  [ fig.force ] because the lpf dynamics and the controllers introduce a phase delay to each of the two components .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that these displacements and rotations are within acceptable margins because they do not exceed the authority limits of the drag free and low - frequency controllers .",

    "this figure has been obtained simulating the output of the entire instrument for each of the noise sources presented previously in sect .",
    "[ sec : noisesources ] .",
    "we simulated 100000 seconds for each source of noise .",
    "then , we performed the spectral estimation with a smoothed power spectral estimator based on the welch estimator using a blackman - harris window  @xcite .",
    "the time domain simulation and the spectral analysis have been performed using the ltpda toolbox @xcite .",
    "this is the data analysis tool that will be used for mission operations . as can be seen , in the frequency domain the signals at @xmath25 and @xmath73 are clearly visible .",
    "note that the most important contribution is that of the sensors noise , which is mainly characterized by the high - frequency noise of the interferometer , the contribution of the feep thrusters and the disturbance noise of the test masses .",
    "the environment noise , the magnetic hardware noise and of the solar and infrared emission contribution are totally negligible in the interferometer readings and do not represent any restriction in terms of parameter estimation quality .",
    "we have already shown that the displacements and rotations of the test masses can be detected even in the case in which all the noise sources are considered . now",
    "the question to be answered is to which accuracy the magnetic properties of the test masses can be estimated . to this end",
    "we have used a classical linear least squares procedure  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic parameters are estimated in the following way .",
    "let @xmath128 be the differential displacement signals from the interferometer , and @xmath129 and @xmath130 the rotation excursions around the @xmath29- and the @xmath31-axis , respectively , we write then :    @xmath131    where we have used eq .",

    "we have examined the contribution of each of the noise sources in our estimation accuracy .",
    "the accuracy of the measurements of the magnetic properties of the test masses is mainly affected by the specific contribution of the noise source within the measurement bandwith .",
    "for instance , if some noise source has a relevant contribution around 1mhz in the rotation signals , the estimating algorithm can not disentangle this contribution from that of the injected torque . in table [ tab : estimation ] we list the accuracies of the estimated magnetic parameters obtained for each of the individual noise sources and that obtained when all the noise sources are present ( last row ) . rather naturally , the results for @xmath64 and @xmath9 shown in this table are closely related to the noise contributions shown in figure [ fig.noisebreakdown ]  note that figure  [ fig.noisebreakdown ] , only shows the noise breakdown for the differential displacement channel . the largest contribution to the error budget",
    "are , as expected , the actuators noise , the interferometer noise and the test mass disturbances . nevertheless , the overall quality of the estimate is fairly good , 1.43% ( mean square error of the relative errors of all the estimated parameters ) .",
    "it is interesting to note as well that even if the rotations signals present signal to noise ratios around a factor of 3 smaller , we obtain errors of the same order of magnitude for the estimates of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this stems from the fact that the signals from which they are obtained must not be disentangled .",
    "in this paper we have confirmed the feasibility of deriving the magnetic properties of the test masses of lisa pathfinder .",
    "the magnetic experiment is based on injecting controlled sinusoidal currents through the on - board coils and studying the dynamics of the test masses , as measured with the optical metrology subsystem . in our study",
    "we have performed numerical calculations that incorporate a full model of the dynamics of the test masses , realistic noise sources and up - to - date simulations of the interferometer and inertial sensors . in particular , all the degrees of freedom of the test masses have been appropriately analyzed and we have fully taken into account the control architecture of lisa pathfinder . we have obtained that the displacements of the test masses along the @xmath22-direction are @xmath142 nm , while the rotation excursions are approximately @xmath143rad .",
    "these findings confirm that the magnetic experiment is within the authority margins of the drag free and low frequency suspension controllers .",
    "consequently , any damage to the entire experiment when the coils are excited can be safely discarded .",
    "moreover , we have shown as well that the displacement and rotation signals can be processed and pipelined to an adequate estimation algorithm that allows to estimate both the magnetic moment and the magnetic susceptibility of the test masses to a good accuracy . specifically , assuming that the remnant magnetic moment is homogenous within the entire volume of the test masses , the estimates have errors below the 2% level .",
