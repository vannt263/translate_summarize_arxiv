    "the concept of charge stripes@xcite is a controversial one in the field of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "there is direct evidence from neutron diffraction measurements for charge and spin stripe order in a couple of cuprates,@xcite la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and la@xmath4ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 with @xmath5 ; however , the ordering of stripes is correlated with the depression of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath6.@xcite ( for reference , fig .  [ fig : stripes ] shows examples of possible stripe domains . ) while it is clear that static _ ordering _ of stripes competes with superconductivity , this does not mean that dynamic stripes are necessarily bad for superconductivity . in this paper",
    ", i will argue the case that stripes , in fact , underlie the high - temperature superconductivity in under- to optimally - doped cuprates ( with the implication that stripes , or more general forms of charge inhomogeneity , are essential to the superconductivity ) .",
    "wakimoto _ et al._@xcite have recently shown that the low - energy ( @xmath7  mev ) magnetic scattering decreases rapidly with overdoping beyond @xmath8 , going to zero by @xmath9 . in the stripe picture ,",
    "the magnetic excitations are associated with the stripe - correlated regions , so that the experimental results are consistent with a decrease in the stripe fraction in the overdoped regime .",
    "measurements are currently underway to test whether this decrease in magnetic signal also applies at higher energies , up to 100 mev .",

    "<S> one type of order that has been observed to compete with superconductivity in cuprates involves alternating charge and antiferromagnetic stripes . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , it now appears that there may be a universal magnetic spectrum for the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> one likely implication of this universal spectrum is that stripes of a dynamic form are present in the superconducting samples . on cooling through the superconducting transition temperature , </S>",
    "<S> a gap opens in the magnetic spectrum , and the weight lost at low energy piles up above the gap ; the transition temperature is correlated with the size of the spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the magnitude of the spin gap with respect to the magnetic spectrum , the enhanced magnetic scattering at low temperature can be either commensurate or incommensurate . </S>",
