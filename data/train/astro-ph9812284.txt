    "the existence and nature of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) outflows from an accretion disk threaded by an ordered magnetic field is a long - standing astrophysical problem .",
    "the problem has been investigated theoretically by many authors ( blandford & payne 1982 ; pudritz & norman 1986 ; sakurai 1987 ; koupelis & van horn 1989 ; lovelace , berk & contopoulos 1991 ; pelletier & pudritz 1992 ; knigl & ruden 1993 ; cao & spruit 1994 ; contopoulos & lovelace 1994 ; contopoulos 1995 ; ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "see also reviews by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1993 ) and livio ( 1997 ) . from the theory",
    ", a necessary condition for magnetically / centrifugally driven outflows is that the poloidal magnetic field at the disk s surface be inclined away from the symmetry axis ( @xmath16 ) at a sufficiently large angle .",
    "however , the analytical theory makes drastic simplifications such as assuming self - similar dependences on the radial distance ( @xmath17 in cylindrical coordinates ) , or by integrating over the cross - section of the outflow .",
    "the self - similar solutions have divergences at both small and large @xmath17 so that the influence of these regions is unknown .",
    "numerical mhd simulations are essential to establish the existence and understand the nature of magnetically / centrifugally driven outflows .",
    "stationary and non - stationary mhd flows were investigated by kudoh & shibata ( 1995 , 1997a , b ) in one - dimensional ( @xmath18d ) simulations .",
    "these simulations allowed an investigation of outflows for a wide range of parameters .",
    "however , they supposed a fixed configuration of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "two - dimensional ( @xmath19d ) simulations of outflows from accretion disks were performed by uchida & shibata ( 1985 ) , shibata & uchida ( 1986 ) , stone & norman ( 1994 ) , matsumoto et al .",
    "these simulations led to strongly non - stationary accretion and outflows from the disk . in most of these studies , the non - stationarity of the solutions is due to the start up conditions with the disk rotating but the corona of the disk not rotating .",
    "in other cases the non - stationarity is due to the disk rotating at a significantly sub - keplerian rate .",
    "these simulations are valuable in showing that temporary mhd outflows are possible , but the results depend strongly on the assumed initial conditions .    in order to avoid the strong dependence on initial conditions and the problems associated with following the internal dynamics of the accretion disk , we earlier proposed treating the outer , surface layers of the disk as a boundary condition ( ustyugova et al . 1995 ; koldoba et al . 1996 ; romanova et al . 1997 ; romanova et al .",
    "this approach has been followed by others ( ouyed & pudritz 1997 ; ouyed , pudritz & stone 1997 ; meier et al .",
    "1997 ) . in these simulations",
    "the `` disk '' represents an outer layer of the accretion disk .",
    "in actual situation , the outflowing matter will affect the disk evolution , or at least to the evolution of the surface layers of the disk .",
    "the angular momentum carried away by mhd outflows can give a disk accretion rate much larger than the viscous accretion rate of say an @xmath20-disk , but the accretion speeds are typically much smaller than the free - fall speed ( lovelace , romanova & newman 1994 ; lovelace , newman & romanova 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the disk can be treated as stationary during the formation and establishment of mhd outflows which takes place on a free - fall time scale . however , the long - time simulations of outflows including the back reaction on the disk are clearly of interest for future research .",
    "different initial magnetic field configurations have been assumed in earlier studies .",
    "the initial field assumed by ouyed & pudritz ( 1997 ) was the cao & spruit ( 1994 ) field which decreases slowly with radial distance on the disk s surface .",
    "on the other hand , the initial magnetic field of ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1995 ) was the split - monopole field ( sakurai 1978 ; 1985 ) , which decreases rapidly with radial distance on the disk surface .",
    "the temperature of matter outflowing from the disk of ouyed & pudritz ( 1997 ) was small , and the initial magnetic field was weak . however , ouyed & pudritz ( 1997 ) introduced a spectrum of turbulent alfvn waves with a high pressure which is similar to having a high temperature corona .",
    "thus the approach of ouyed & pudritz ( 1997 ) is similar to that of ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1995 ) where the magnetic field is weak and the coronal temperature is high . in both papers , the initial twist of the magnetic field results from the disk rotation because the corona is not rotating .",
    "this twisting of the magnetic field gives the collimation observed in both papers .",
    "it is important to get stationary outflows using time - dependent mhd equations because the non - stationary flows may be artifacts of the initial conditions .",
    "stationary magneto - centrifugally driven outflows for relatively low temperature of the `` disk '' matter were obtained in the @xmath19d simulations by romanova et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the case where the initial magnetic field was a `` tapered '' split monopole type field .",
    "this work found that in the stationary state the outflow was quasi - spherical with essentially no collimation within the simulation region .",
    "close to the disk the outflow was driven by the centrifugal force while at larger distances the magnetic force was dominant .    in this work",
    "we investigate the case of a pure ( that is , non - tapered ) split - monopole magnetic field by axisymmetric ( 2.5d ) numerical simulations .",
    "the motivation was to study mhd outflows from a relatively cold accretion disk where magnetic field lines are inclined away from the symmetry axis . to remove the influence of the region near the axis where magnetic field lines are not significantly inclined",
    ", we pushed hot matter from the disk in the small area around the axis .",
    "we compare our simulation results with the theory of stationary mhd flows .",
    "further , we use our stationary simulation flows to investigate the influence of outer boundary conditions . our earlier study ( romanova et al .",
    "1997 ) showed that some simple outer boundary conditions on the toroidal magnetic field can lead to artificial forces on the boundary which significantly influence the flow within the simulation region . here , we consider in further detail the influence of outer boundary conditions on the calculated flows .    in  2",
    "the theory of stationary mhd flows is briefly reviewed . in ",
    "3 the numerical model is presented .",
    "the influence of the outer boundary condition on the toroidal magnetic field and the shape of the computational region is analyzed in  4 . in  5 we present results of simulations of stationary flows and compare them with theory . in ",
    "6 conclusions of this work are summarized .",
    "the theory of stationary , axisymmetric , ideal mhd flows was developed by chandrasekhar ( 1956 ) , woltjer ( 1959 ) , mestel ( 1961 ) , kulikovskyi & lyubimov ( 1962 ) , and others . under these conditions",
    "the mhd equations can be reduced to a single equation for the `` flux function '' @xmath21 in cylindrical @xmath22 coordinates ( heinemann & olbert 1978 ; lovelace et al .",
    "1986 ) . the flux function @xmath23 labels flux surfaces so that @xmath24const represents the poloidal projection of a field line .",
    "the equation for @xmath23 is commonly referred to as the grad - shafranov equation ( lovelace et al .",
    "1986 ) .      for axisymmetric conditions the flow field can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the poloidal @xmath27 component , @xmath28 is the toroidal component , and @xmath29 is the unit toroidal vector .",
    "similarly , the magnetic field can be written as @xmath30 .",
    "the ideal mhd equations then imply that certain quantities are constants on any given flux surface @xmath24const or equivalently they are constants along any given stream line or a given magnetic field line .",
    "these integrals are functions of @xmath23 ( see for example lovelace et al .",
    "1986 ) , @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the entropy , @xmath37 is the enthalpy , and @xmath38 is the gravitational potential .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 corresponds to the conservation of mass along a streamline , @xmath40 to the conservation of angular momentum , @xmath41 to the conservation of helicity , @xmath36 to the conservation of entropy , and @xmath42 ( bernoulli s constant ) to the conservation of energy .",
    "the remaining mhd equation ( which can not be written in the integral form ) is the euler force equation across the poloidal magnetic field line ( bogovalov 1997 ) , @xmath43 @xmath44 which is equivalent to the grad - shafranov equation . here",
    ", @xmath45 is the derivative in the direction perpendicular to magnetic field lines and directed outward from the axis , @xmath46 is the angle of inclination of the poloidal magnetic field line away from the @xmath15axis , @xmath47 is the distance from the disk along a magnetic field line , @xmath48 are the poloidal and azimuthal alfvn velocities .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is the curvature of magnetic field line .",
    "the first two terms in equation ( 6 ) are determined by the non - diagonal ( tension ) part of the stress tensor , @xmath50 .",
    "the third term is determined by the total ( matter plus magnetic ) pressure @xmath51 and the gravity force @xmath52 .      to clarify the physical sense of the integrals of motion",
    ", it is useful to derive the fluxes of mass , angular momentum ( about the @xmath15axis ) , and energy .",
    "the corresponding conservation laws for stationary conditions are @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 = 0 ~. \\eqno(9)\\ ] ] because @xmath56 , the vector flux densities are directed along the field lines .    consider the fluxes through an annular region with surface area element @xmath57 . the matter flux through the axisymmetric surface @xmath58 extending out from the @xmath15axis is @xmath59 where we took into account the integral ( 1 ) .",
    "@xmath60 is the magnetic flux through the annular region bounded by flux surfaces @xmath23 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus we can change from space integration to integration over @xmath23 . because @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 corresponds to the @xmath15axis .",
    "similarly , @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 @xmath68\\ ] ] @xmath69 thus , @xmath70 is the matter flux between the flux surfaces separated by @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the angular momentum flux , and @xmath73 is the energy flux .",
    "note that @xmath74 is specific angular momentum carried along the magnetic field line @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the specific energy , and @xmath77 is the angular velocity of the disk at the point where the magnetic field line or flux surface @xmath78 intersects the disk ( for @xmath79 at the disk ) .",
    "conditions at the alfvn surface are known to be important for the global properties of mhd flows ( weber & davis 1967 ) .",
    "equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) constitute a linear system of equations for @xmath80 and @xmath13 .",
    "the determinant of this system is zero if @xmath81 . under this condition",
    "a solution exists if @xmath82 ( weber & davis 1967 ) which corresponds to @xmath83 .",
    "this is the condition which defines the alfvn surface .",
    "figure 1 shows a possible field line @xmath75 and alfvn surface @xmath84 .",
    "the radius at which this field line intersects the disk is @xmath85 . the radius at which it crosses the alfvn surface is @xmath86 .",
    "the density at this point on the alfvn surface is @xmath87 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath88 equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give @xmath89 @xmath90 taking into account ( 14 ) - ( 16 ) , one can express the fluxes of mass , angular momentum and energy , using only the values of physical quantities on the alfvn surface : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93      for understanding the plasma acceleration , we project the different forces onto the poloidal magnetic field lines . as mentioned , in a stationary state , matter flows along the poloidal magnetic field lines .",
    "the acceleration in the poloidal @xmath27 plane is @xmath94 the last term represents the centrifugal acceleration @xmath95 . to get the force per unit mass along a magnetic field line",
    ", we multiply the euler equation by a unit vector @xmath96 parallel to @xmath97 .",
    "this gives @xmath98~ , \\eqno(21)\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the inclination angle of the field line to the @xmath15axis .",
    "the final term of ( 21 ) is the projection of the magnetic force in the direction of @xmath96 , which can be transformed to @xmath99= -{1\\over{8 \\pi \\rho r^2 } } { \\partial(rb_\\phi)^2\\over\\partial s}~,\\ ] ] which is useful for understanding our results .",
    "when magnetic field lines are inclined outward , away from the symmetry axis , the gravitational force @xmath100 opposes the outflow of matter from the disk .",
    "if the matter is relatively cold then the pressure gradient force @xmath101 is unimportant .",
    "then matter can be accelerated outward by the centrifugal force @xmath102 and/or the magnetic force @xmath103 .",
    "this determines the driving mechanisms of the outflow , centrifugal and/or magnetic .",
    "the centrifugal force always acts to accelerates matter outward if the distance between magnetic field line and the axis increases .",
    "consider the direction of the magnetic force .",
    "note that the lines on which @xmath104const are also poloidal current - density lines ; that is , @xmath105 so that @xmath106 .",
    "consider a configuration of magnetic field line @xmath107const and a line of current - density @xmath108 as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the poloidal component of the magnetic force @xmath109 is perpendicular to the current - density @xmath108 and is shown on figure 2 by arrows .",
    "projection of this force onto the poloidal magnetic field shows that the force pushes matter upward near the disk ( lower part of the region ) , and pushes matter downward further from the disk ( upper part of the region ) .",
    "the @xmath110component of the magnetic force @xmath111 acts in the direction of the disk rotation and leads to winding of the magnetic field line close to the disk and leads to unwinding of magnetic field line farther from the disk .",
    "thus , magnetic and centrifugal forces may both accelerate matter , but this depends on the configuration of magnetic field and current - density lines .",
    "consider now the collimation of the flow . from equation ( 6 ) , taking into account that @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 @xmath114 at large distances from the alfvn surface @xmath115 , the density @xmath116 , but values @xmath117 and @xmath118 remain finite ( heyvaerts and norman 1989 )",
    ". then @xmath119 , so that the second term on the left - hand side of ( 22 ) is negligible . on the right - hand side ,",
    "only the first term is important for @xmath120 .",
    "then , equation ( 22 ) simplifies to @xmath121 thus , the curvature of magnetic field lines in the region @xmath120 is determined by the gradient @xmath122 .",
    "figure 3 shows examples where two magnetic field lines @xmath123 and @xmath124 cross the line @xmath104 const .",
    "again , the magnetic force @xmath125 acts in the direction perpendicular to the current - density @xmath108 . here , we are interested in the projection of this force onto a poloidal magnetic field line . from the figure",
    "one can see that the magnetic force acts to `` collimate '' the magnetic field line @xmath123 and `` anticollimate '' the field line @xmath124 .",
    "for our time - dependent simulations of axisymmetric flows of an ideal plasma in a gravitational field the equations are @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 here , @xmath36 is entropy , @xmath130 @xmath131 ; is the stress tensor ; @xmath132 is the gravitational acceleration ; and @xmath38 is the gravitational potential of the central object .",
    "the energy equation ( 27 ) is written in conservative form . from ( 24 ) and ( 27 ) , one also has @xmath133}{\\partial { \\rm t } } + { \\bf { \\bf \\nabla}}\\cdot \\left [ \\rho f(s ) { \\bf v}\\right ] = 0~ , \\eqno(28)\\ ] ] for any continuous function @xmath134 .",
    "we take the equation of state to be @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is specific internal energy , and @xmath137 const . in the present work @xmath138 .",
    "we take @xmath139 , because the right - hand side depends only on the entropy .",
    "we solve the system of equations ( 24)-(26 ) and ( 28 ) numerically .",
    "the central object of mass @xmath5 is at the center of our coordinate system .",
    "the disk is located at @xmath140 and is treated as a perfectly conducting surface rotating with keplerian velocity @xmath141 .",
    "the gravitational acceleration @xmath142 diverges as @xmath143 , but of course the presence of a star or black hole changes this dependence . instead of including the finite size of the central object , the gravitational potential is smoothed close to the origin , @xmath144 , where @xmath6 is the smoothing radius .",
    "the value @xmath6 is always much smaller than the size of the computational region . for this",
    "smoothed potential , the keplerian velocity ( for @xmath140 ) becomes @xmath145 .",
    "our results do not depend significantly on @xmath6 because the main part of the outflow occurs from the inclined magnetic field in the region of the disk where @xmath146 .",
    "equations ( 24 ) - ( 26 ) and ( 28 ) were solved with our godunov type numerical code ( koldoba et al .",
    "1992 ; koldoba & ustyugova 1994 ; ustyugova et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the code is based on the ideas of roe ( 1986 ) for hydrodynamics and the related ideas of brio & wu ( 1988 ) for mhd .",
    "this type of tvd numerical scheme has also been developed and investigated by others ( for example , ryu , jones & frank 1995 ) .",
    "the code has passed a number of essential tests ( koldoba et al .",
    "1992 ; koldoba & ustyugova 1994 ) which are analogous to those described by ryu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . compared with our earlier applications of this code ( ustyugova et al .",
    "1995 ; koldoba et al .",
    "1996 ) , a number of improvements have been made , including a procedure for guaranteeing that @xmath147 . to satisfy the condition @xmath147",
    ", we projected the calculated magnetic field to the sub  space of solenoidal functions @xmath148 at each time step .",
    "we introduced the function @xmath23 , which satisfies the equation @xmath149 \\psi = -~r \\left ( \\frac{\\partial b_r}{\\partial z } - \\frac{\\partial b_z}{\\partial r } \\right ) ~.\\ ] ] then the magnetic field @xmath148 was calculated for which @xmath150 .",
    "a similar method was used by ryu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "most of the simulations were done on a grid with @xmath151 points in cylindrical coordinates . for the calculations on an approximately square region we used an inhomogeneous grid with @xmath152 points while for the axially elongated region we used a homogeneous grid with @xmath153 points .",
    "we also did a smaller number of simulations using spherical coordinates @xmath154 and a grid @xmath155 .",
    "the motivation for this work was the study of stationary mhd flows .",
    "hence it may appear that the initial conditions are unimportant .",
    "however , in practice , an unfavorable choice of initial conditions can lead to an essentially longer stage of transition to stationary state , or even worse , stationary flows may never be reached .",
    "the region right above the disk is the most important , because the velocity distribution near the disk determines the number of boundary conditions ( the flow may be subsonic or supersonic ) .",
    "also , the physical parameters , such as density and magnetic field , are largest just above the disk . hence , we worked more carefully on the equilibrium at small values of @xmath16 . at large @xmath16 ,",
    "approximate equilibrium in the @xmath16-direction was sufficient , because the magnetic field , which is dominant in the corona , stabilizes matter against the violent movements .",
    "the expressions given below are found to be useful initial conditions which give a smooth start up of the outflows .",
    "the initial conditions are arranged as follows .",
    "the disk and corona are considered to be threaded by a poloidal magnetic field of monopole type ( sakurai 1987 ) , @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the `` charge '' of the monopole , @xmath158 is the position vector of the monopole located on the symmetry axis at a distance @xmath159 below the disk .",
    "the temperature on the disk surface , which is proportional to the square of ( isothermal ) sound speed @xmath160 , was taken to have the dependence @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are parameters , @xmath164 is a characteristic radius inside of which the disk is relatively hot . for specificity",
    "we take @xmath165 . for @xmath166 , @xmath167",
    "; that is , the sound speed is constant fraction of the keplerian velocity in the region where we expect centrifugally / magnetically driven outflows from the disk .",
    "the term in ( 29 ) with @xmath163 increases the temperature in the region near the axis , where magnetic or centrifugal outflows are not expected . for actual conditions ,",
    "this part of the flow may be connected with the star or black hole ( livio 1997 ) .",
    "we supposed that the initial temperature of the corona is a function only of @xmath17 , so that the equation ( 29 ) is the initial condition for the entire computational region .",
    "also , we supposed that in @xmath15direction the gravitational force is balanced by the pressure gradient ,    @xmath168 the solution of this equation is @xmath169~ , \\eqno(31)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath170 is the pressure on the disk surface , and @xmath171 is the gravitational potential on the disk .    in the initial state ,",
    "the surface of the disk is in equilibrium .",
    "we suppose that the gravitational force on the disk surface is compensated by the centrifugal force , while the matter pressure gradient in @xmath172direction is compensated by the magnetic force .",
    "that is , on the disk ( @xmath140 ) , @xmath173 solution of this equation for pressure on the disk @xmath170 and current @xmath174 flowing through a circular area of radius @xmath17 on the disk can be written as @xmath175 @xmath176^{1/2}~ , \\eqno(34)\\ ] ] where @xmath177 , with @xmath178const , and @xmath46 is the inclination of magnetic field line to the axis of rotation .",
    "this gave us possibility to find initial azimuthal magnetic field along the disk , @xmath179 .",
    "close to the disk , @xmath180 is approximately constant along a magnetic field line .",
    "the three components of the initial magnetic field on the disk are shown in figure 4 .    to escape rapid twisting of the magnetic field due to the difference between the azimuthal velocities of the disk and the corona",
    ", we supposed that the corona initially rotates with an angular velocity which is constant on cylinders @xmath181const and equal to @xmath182 of the disk . as a result of this rotation",
    "the corona is not in equilibrium in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "however , this lack of initial equilibrium does not disrupt the evolution of outflows from the disk , and it does not affect the final stationary states where the flow reaches equilibrium .      the lower boundary of our simulation region is the disk which is perfectly conducting and rotates at the keperian rate .",
    "thus the tangential component of the electric field in the system of coordinates rotating with the disk is zero , @xmath183_{r,\\phi } = 0~ , \\eqno(35)\\ ] ] at @xmath140 , where @xmath184 , and @xmath185 is the fluid velocity just above the disk .",
    "this condition means that in this system of coordinates the poloidal velocity is parallel to the poloidal magnetic field at @xmath140 .",
    "the magnetic field is frozen into the disk so that @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is a given function of @xmath17 and is determined by the @xmath16-component of the initial monopole magnetic field .",
    "notice that the two other field components , @xmath188 and @xmath13 , are not fixed on the disk and change with time so as to satisfy the mhd equations in the computational region .",
    "we suppose that the density and entropy on the disk surface are fixed , @xmath189 with @xmath190 and @xmath191 given functions of @xmath17 which follow from equations ( 29 ) and ( 31 ) .",
    "note that in the present work , the velocity of outflow from the disk is a free variable .",
    "this is different from our earlier work ( ustyugova et al .",
    "1995 ) . when the velocity of outflow from the disk is less than the slow magnetosonic speed , then the number of boundary conditions we have is sufficient .",
    "however , if the outflow velocity is super slow magnetosonic , then there should be an additional boundary condition . because we do not have this additional boundary condition",
    ", we suppose that the amplitudes of the correponding outgoing waves are equal to zero .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that we use the values of calculated parameters in the cells just above the disk .    on the @xmath15axis ,",
    "all fluxes normal to this axis are equal to zero . on the outer boundaries , @xmath192 or @xmath193 , the `` free '' boundary conditions @xmath194 were used for all variables excluding @xmath13 . here",
    ", @xmath195 is the derivative perpendicular to the boundary , @xmath196 @xmath197 .",
    "our earlier simulation study ( romanova et al . 1997 ) showed that the condition @xmath198 can lead to unphysical results .",
    "the outer boundary condition on @xmath13 is considered in detail in  4 .",
    "if the process of outflow formation is strongly non - stationary , then the problem of the influence of outer boundary conditions may not appear .",
    "this is because it is difficult to separate the influence of boundary conditions from effects connected with non - stationarity .",
    "however , when the flow goes to a steady - state , we observed that the stationary flow pattern can depend on the imposed outer boundary conditions and in some cases on the shape of the simulation region .",
    "it is important to eliminate the influence of boundary conditions .",
    "it is possible , if ( 1 ) the flow is supersonic ( super fast magnetosonic ) and it is _ perpendicular _ to the outer boundaries ( then information flows out of the simulation region ) , or ( 2 ) the correct boundary conditions are chosen by some method .",
    "the first condition can not be realized during the stage of establishing of the flow , because initially , the flow is subsonic .",
    "if the flow is supersonic , but is not perpendicular to the boundary , then the mach cones may be partially directed inside the simulation region and even supersonic flow may influence the flow inside the region .",
    "the orientation of the mach cones depends in general on the shape of simulation region",
    ".    the second condition can be realized only in some approximation .",
    "the `` best '' outer boundary conditions are those which influence only the vicinity of the boundaries and not the central part of the simulation region .",
    "this involves all flow variables , but we will discuss only the outer boundary condition on @xmath13 , because we found that this condition had the strongest influence on the calculated flows .",
    "the final flow may depend on both the mach cone orientation at the boundaries ( shape of the region ) and on the outer boundary condition on @xmath13 .",
    "in different situations one of these factors may be more important than the other .",
    "to separate their influence on the final flow pattern , we discuss in  4.1 simulations for a fixed simulation region , but with different outer boundary conditions on @xmath13 .",
    "next , in  4.2 we fixed the boundary condition on @xmath13 , and investigated the dependence of the flow on the shape of simulation region and the mach cones orientation at the outer boundaries . in ",
    "4.3 we discuss both factors .      here",
    ", we present results of simulations for a fixed elongated simulation region @xmath199 , @xmath200 for three different outer boundary conditions on @xmath13 : ( 1 ) a standard `` free '' boundary condition , ( 2 ) a``force - free '' boundary condition , and ( 3 ) a `` force - balance '' boundary condition .",
    "first , we performed simulations for the simplest standard `` free '' boundary condition on @xmath13 , @xmath201 .",
    "we observed that this boundary condition may give an artificial force on the boundary which influences the flow within the computational region .",
    "for example , if we suppose that on the top boundary @xmath202 , then the radial component of the current - density equals to zero , @xmath203 @xmath204 , which means that the poloidal current - density has only a @xmath16-component @xmath205 . this means that the poloidal current - density @xmath108 is not parallel to the poloidal magnetic field @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , there is a force ( density ) @xmath206 acting in the @xmath207 direction , opposite to the rotation of the disk .",
    "figure 5 shows the geometry .",
    "these ` boundary ' forces act such way that the flow never reaches a stationary state .",
    "to check this fact , and to be sure that this is not an effect of non - stationarity of our initial configuration , we did simulations for cases which went to a stationary state with other outer boundary conditions . after establishing stationarity",
    ", we substituted the outer boundary conditions on @xmath13 to a `` free '' boundary condition .",
    "we observed that the stationary state was destroyed for the reasons mentioned above .",
    "figures 6a , b demonstrate one stage of this destruction , when the poloidal velocity decreased and became less than fast magnetosonic speed in all of the computational region .",
    "even the fluxes of mass and other physical parameters through the boundaries are not constants in this simulation .",
    "also , matter with magnetic flux enters the region from the right - hand side , which is due to the flow being sub - fast magnetosonic .    to avoid this artificial force , we proposed a `` force - free '' outer boundary condition on @xmath13 ( romanova et al .",
    "1997 ) which we discuss in the next subsection .",
    "another possibility to consider is that the toroidal component of the magnetic force is zero on the outer boundaries .",
    "that is , @xmath208 on the outer boundaries .",
    "we can write this condition as @xmath209 we performed simulations with this boundary condition in the elongated region and observed that the flow reached a stationary state ( see figures 6 c , d ) .",
    "this flow has many characteristics of stationary flow .",
    "fluxes of mass , energy , and momentum , integrated over different cross - sections , are constants .",
    "integrals of motion along magnetic field lines are also constants .",
    "the flow is _ well collimated _ inside the simulation region ( see figures 6c , d ) .",
    "however , more detailed analysis ( see  4.2 ) shows that this collimation is artificial .",
    "the `` force - free '' boundary condition for @xmath13 is superior to the `` free '' boundary condition , because it leads to a stationary state , but it does not give the physically correct flow .",
    "in reality , the magnetic force should not be zero on the boundary .",
    "there is a magnetic force pushing matter outward through the outer boundaries .",
    "one can see from figure 6d    that the poloidal current - density ( dashed lines ) is not parallel to the poloidal magnetic field ( solid lines ) .",
    "however , on the boundaries ( figure 6d ) the two vectors are forced to be parallel and thus the poloidal force equals zero .",
    "this boundary condition is better than the `` free '' boundary condition in the sense that there is no strong artificial force at the boundary .",
    "from the other side , when we put the force equal to zero , it is analogous to application of a force equal to the real force but with the opposite sign .",
    "this is one of the factors which may lead to artificial collimation .",
    "another possible factor ( mach cones orientation ) depends on the shape of the simulation region and is discussed in  4.2 .      as a next step for improving the outer boundary condition on @xmath13 ,",
    "we take into account the fact that the magnetic field is not force - free and @xmath108 is not parallel to @xmath97 .",
    "we start from equation ( 16 ) for @xmath13 and write it in the form @xmath210 where we assume that the density at the boundary is much less than that at the alfvn surface , @xmath116 for @xmath211 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath212 @xmath213 where we supposed that @xmath214 and took into account that @xmath41 and @xmath215 are constants along magnetic field lines .",
    "[ figure 6 ]    finally , we obtain the outer boundary condition as @xmath216 where @xmath20 is a parameter . in this case",
    "we got stationary flows which are _ not collimated _ in the simulation region ( see figures 6e , f ) .",
    "fluxes through the outer surfaces and integrals along magnetic field lines are well conserved , as in the case of collimated flow , described in  4.1.2 .",
    "the question arises , which boundary condition is correct , `` force - free '' or `` force - balance '' ?",
    "the `` force - balance '' condition is clearly the physical condition because it does not generate an artificial force on the boundary .",
    "however , it is more difficult to apply because there is no direct method for determining the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "it can only be obtained iteratively using additional simulations , which is very time consuming .",
    "our analysis indicates that the `` force - free '' boundary condition gives good results as compared with those obtained using the `` force - balance '' condition _ if _ the shape of the simulation region is not elongated in the @xmath15direction .",
    "below , we investigate different runs for `` force - free '' outer boundary conditions on @xmath13 , but for different shapes of the simulation region .",
    "we noticed empirically that results of simulations depend significantly on the shape of simulation region .",
    "the ratio between @xmath217 to @xmath218 is critical .",
    "we observed that when the region is elongated in @xmath15direction , then the flow has tendency to collimate . when the region is square , or spherical , or elongated in @xmath172direction , then the outflow is almost spherical , that is , only slightly collimated . here , we present results of simulations all with `` force - free '' outer boundary conditions but different shapes of the simulation region .",
    "first , we investigated the case where the height of the region is the same as before , @xmath200 , but the region is much wider , @xmath219 .",
    "figure 7 shows that in this case we got almost spherical outflow , which is very different from the well - collimated outflow in the narrow region at the same boundary conditions ( figures 6c , d ) .",
    "we also performed similar simulations in spherical coordinates with @xmath219 , and got similar result .",
    "the question is why the flows are so different for different shapes of the simulation region ? in all cases the flow is super fast magnetosonic in most of the region .",
    "however , note that even if the flow is super fast magnetosonic , information can flow in from the boundaries to the simulation region , if the mach cones are directed inside the simulation region .",
    "the mach cone projected onto the poloidal plane has a half opening angle @xmath220 which is @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the slow and fast magnetosonic velocities , respectively , which satisfy @xmath224 ( with @xmath225 and @xmath226 ) and @xmath227 is the `` cusp '' velocity ( polovin & demutskii 1980 ; lovelace et al . 1986 ; bogovalov 1997 ) .",
    "figures 6 - 8 show the mach cones on the outer boundaries for different shapes of the simulation region .",
    "we find that in the case of an elongated region ( figure 6d ) an essential part of the mach cones is directed into the simulation region , whereas in the case of an almost square region ( figure 7b ) only very small part of the mach cones is directed into the region .",
    "figure 8 shows that the most desirable geometry - where information flows outward across the outer boundary - is obtained in spherical coordinates where all mach cones are directed outward from the simulation region .    the elongated region is the least desirable and as discussed it gives artificial collimation of the flow .",
    "note that the first stationary mhd flow solutions ( romanova et al .",
    "1997 ) were obtained using a simulation region elongated in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "regarding the outer boundaries , we conclude that simulated flows may depend on both the outer boundary condition on @xmath13 and on the shape of simulation region ( the mach cone orientation on the outer boundary ) .",
    "the influence of each of these factors may be different in different situations .",
    "the orientation of the mach cones at the boundary is not connected directly with existence and configuration of a stationary flow .",
    "however , if mach cones are partly directed inside the simulation region along part of the outer boundary , then the question arises : what is the result of this influence , and how strong is it ?",
    "our simulations shown that for a `` force - free '' boundary condition on @xmath228 the result is artificial collimation of the flow , whereas in the case of a `` free '' boundary condition there is destruction of a stationary flow which was arranged as an initial condition .    from comparison of cases shown in figures 6d and 7b",
    "it is not clear that mach cones are responsible for the collimation of the flow in the case shown in figure 6d . in the narrow region ,",
    "the magnetic field at the right - hand , outer boundary is much stronger than in the case of wide region , so that influence of the non - exact `` force - free '' boundary condition should be stronger in the case of a narrow region . to check this possibility , we performed simulations in a small square region with @xmath199 and @xmath229 and found uncollimated almost spherical outflow .",
    "this indicates that the shape of the region is the most important factor affecting collimation .",
    "another question are evident .",
    "why in the case of the `` force - balance '' boundary condition on @xmath13 in the elongated region do we find the physically correct stationary solution ?",
    "we suggest that during establishment of the stationary flow , which may be quite violent ( in spite of almost stationary initial conditions ) , this boundary conditions kept approach to stationarity less violent ( than in the case of `` force - free '' boundary conditions ) and kept the mach cones directed outward most of the time .",
    "the fact that in this case a small part of the mach cones is directed inside the region , means that some inflow of information from the outer boundary may have only a small affect on the flow .",
    "for some purposes , such as the study of the propagation of jets , it is attractive to use a long narrow computational region .",
    "the general conclusion of this section is that a narrow region can lead to artificial collimation of the flow or invalid solutions unless special care is given to the boundary condition on @xmath13 .",
    "here , we describe results of simulations for a region @xmath219 and @xmath200 with a `` force - free '' outer boundary condition . simulations of the flow in the same region but with the `` modified '' boundary condition gave similar results .",
    "figure 9 shows the initial distribution on the disk of the keplerian velocity @xmath230 , the poloidal alfvn velocity @xmath231 , and the sound speed @xmath232 .",
    "matter outflowing from the disk has a time - independent distribution of density as a function of radius .",
    "the velocity of outflow from the disk is determined by the solution of the mhd equations in the simulation region .",
    "the simulations show that in a stationary state matter just above the disk has a velocity somewhat larger than the slow magnetosonic velocity .",
    "this is in accord with the theory which indicates that the slow magnetosonic surface is located inside the disk ( lovelace , romanova , & contopoulos 1993 ) .",
    "moving away from the disk , matter starts from a low velocity , is gradually accelerated and crosses the alfvn and fast magnetosonic surfaces ( see figure 7a ) .",
    "these surfaces are almost parallel to the disk .",
    "figure 10a shows the variation of different velocities along a representative magnetic field line , the third line away from the @xmath15axis in figure 7 , on the flow distance @xmath47 from the disk .",
    "this field line , which we refer to as the `` reference '' field line , crosses the top boundary at about the midpoint of this boundary .",
    "this line is not special , but it is inclined sufficiently to the axis that magnetic / centrifugal forces are important .",
    "figure 10a shows in particular the dependence of the poloidal velocity @xmath233 , which becomes larger than the alfvn velocity @xmath231 fairly close to the disk , at @xmath234 .",

    "the poloidal velocity is parallel to the poloidal magnetic field to a good approximation in accord with the theory .",
    "figure 10b shows the dependences of @xmath233 for different field lines .    within the simulation region",
    ", the outflow accelerates from thermal velocity to a much larger asymptotic poloidal flow velocity of the order of @xmath240 .",
    "thus , the _ acceleration distance _ for the outflow , over which the flow accelerates from @xmath8 to , say , @xmath9 of the asymptotic speed , occurs at a flow distance of about @xmath10 .",
    "figure 11 shows the different forces acting along the `` reference '' magnetic field line . the centrifugal force ( @xmath241 ) is larger than the magnetic ( @xmath242 ) or pressure gradient force ( @xmath243 ) immediately above the disk @xmath244 .",
    "the magnetic force is few times larger than the centrifugal force for larger distances , @xmath245 .",
    "note that the pressure gradient force is negligibly small .",
    "thus , the main driving forces pushing matter outward are magnetic and centrifugal .",
    "each poloidal magnetic field line is labeled by its @xmath23 value , which equals the magnetic flux through the circular region between the axis and the field line .",
    "@xmath23 increases from zero on the axis to a largest value on the field line most distant from the axis .",
    "we integrated the forces to obtain the total work performed by the magnetic , centrifugal and other forces , along different field lines from the disk to the outer boundary .",
    "figure 12 shows the dependence of this work on @xmath23 .",

    "the work along the `` reference '' field line marked by `` @xmath246 '' on the @xmath23 axis , is done mainly by the magnetic force with the centrifugal force also important .",

    "note that the work done by the pressure gradient is small for all field lines .",
    "a first indication of stationarity is when the fluxes of mass and other physical quantities become constants in time .",
    "we observed that the fluxes of mass @xmath247 , angular momentum @xmath248 , and energy @xmath249 calculated through the middle of the region @xmath250 become constants after about @xmath251 , where @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath6 is the inner radius of the disk .",

    "this indication of stationarity is necessary , but not a sufficient sign of a valid stationary mhd flow .",
    "another indication of stationarity is that the poloi - dal velocity becomes parallel to the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "we observed , that the two vector fields become parallel to a high accuracy only after @xmath257 .",
    "figure 7a shows that the two vector fields are close to being parallel even at earlier times .",
    "one can get more complete information about stationarity and validity of the mhd flow by comparing the theory reviewed in  3 with the simulation data .",
    "first , the integrals of the motion , @xmath40 , @xmath39 , @xmath42 , @xmath41 , and @xmath36 ( equations 4 - 8) should be constants along any magnetic field line .",
    "we checked this by numerically calculating these integrals along the``reference '' magnetic field line .",
    "the calculated integrals are constants with good accuracy . for example , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "figure 14 shows variation of the integrals . note , that the integrals are not strictly constants in the region immediately above the disk , because the grid is not fine enough in this region due to the strong gravitational force .",
    "note that the integrals become constants as a function of @xmath23 much later ( @xmath260 ) than fluxes of mass , angular momentum , and energy become constants in time .",
    "other comparisons of simulations with theory have been done .",
    "for example , from the theory of stationary flow it follows that fluxes of matter , angular momentum , and energy flowing inside a given flux tube should be equal to fluxes integrated over the alfvn surface , equations ( 17)-(19 ) .",
    "we calculated these integrals in two ways , using the data from our simulations .",
    "figures 15 a , b show these integrals as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "they almost coincide in most of the region , excluding the region of large values of @xmath23 .",
    "the latter field lines have a high angle of inclination relative to the axis and do not pass through the fast magnetosonic surface .",
    "these lines are marked by the long - dashed lines on one of the curves , and by letter `` @xmath261 '' on the @xmath23 axis .",
    "figure 16 shows the @xmath23 dependence of the ratio of the radii where a magnetic field line crosses the alfvn surface and the disk , @xmath262 .",
    "this ratio is of interest , because the value of the angular momentum per unit mass carried by the outflowing matter can be calculated as @xmath263^{1/2}~ , \\eqno(42)\\ ] ] from equation ( 14 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath264 is almost constant means that the specific angular momentum is proportional to @xmath265 and can be estimated in this way .",
    "specifically , @xmath266 for field lines which cross the fast magnetosonic surface .    the fluxes of mass , energy , and angular momentum flowing out from the disk depend of course on the magnetic field strength on the disk .",
    "figure 17 shows the dependence of the matter outflow rate on the disk magnetic field .",
    "this dependence is analogous to that derived by kudoh & shibata ( see kudoh & shibata 1995 , figure 2b , and kudoh & shibata 1997b , figure 24b ) who performed 1.5d analysis of stationary mhd flows at the fixed configuration of poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the stationary mhd outflows we find are approximately spherical outflows with relatively small collimation within the simulation region .",
    "thus , the _ collimation distance _ over which the flow becomes collimated ( with divergence less than , say , @xmath11 ) is much larger than the size of our simulation region .",
    "figure 18 shows the dependence of the angle between the poloidal field direction and the @xmath15axis on the distance along the `` reference '' magnetic field line ( @xmath267 ) and along the `` diagonal '' field line which goes through the top right corner of the simulation region ( @xmath268 ) .",
    "both angles are relatively large ( @xmath269 ) near the disk and then gradually decrease at larger distances @xmath47 along the field line .",
    "this means that some collimation occurs near the disk but decreases at larger distances .",
    "the angle @xmath267 for the `` reference '' field line changes from @xmath270 at the disk to @xmath271 at the top boundary where the angle of the position vector from the origin to the @xmath15axis is about @xmath272 .",

    "an important question is whether the outflow becomes collimated at large distances to form a cylindrical jet parallel to the rotation axis , or it continues as a wind without collimation . to obtain information on this question , we calculated the derivatives @xmath276 along magnetic field lines as also shown in figure 18 .",
    "for both the `` reference '' and the diagonal field lines the derivatives decrease and become very small at the outer boundary .",
    "it appears that the derivatives continue to decrease , which would mean that the collimation decreases and goes to zero .",
    "( the turns at the ends of the lines are connected with boundaries and do not represent a real collimation effect . )",
    "however , the present study does not rule out the possible magnetic collimation of the flow at much larger distances . separate simulations in a much larger region are needed to answer this important question .",
    "earlier , sakurai ( 1987 ) obtained stationary flow solutions for a split - monopole magnetic field and found flows with very gradual collimation at large distances from the origin .",
    "our results are similar in this respect to those of sakurai .",
    "however , it is not clear that the flows will magnetically collimate to cylinders as predicted by heyvaerts & norman ( 1989 ) .",
    "simulations on a much larger region are needed to answer this question .",
    "it is important to note that analytic , self - similar solutions for outflows for cases of very gradually decreasing poloidal magnetic field in the disk ( unlike the present split - monopole field ) show magnetic collimation with increasing distance @xmath16 from the origin ( contopoulos & lovelace 1994 , contopoulos 1995 ; ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "further , note that outflows may be collimated hydrodynamically by the pressure of surrounding , ambient matter ( lovelace , berk , & contopoulos 1991 ; frank & mellema 1996 , mellema & frank 1998 ) .",
    "this mechanism of collimation needs a separate numerical investigation .",
    "it is of interest to compare the present results on collimation with those of our earlier studies , ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and romanova et al .",
    "ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1995 ) introduced the treatment of the disk as a boundary condition and found non - stationary but well - collimated outflows .",

    "considered outflows from a hot accretion disk where the sound speed @xmath277 and a weak magnetic field @xmath278 on the disk surface . for such conditions ,",
    "the main force driving the outflow is the matter pressure gradient while the magnetic force is smaller .",
    "also , ustyugova et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used non - equilibrium initial conditions where the rotation of the disk was started at @xmath279 with the corona of the disk not rotating .",
    "these conditions led to the formation of a strong toroidal magnetic field ( by the winding up of the poloidal field ) and a strong outward propagating torsional alfvn wave .",
    "the fact , that alfvn velocity was much smaller than keplerian veloicity allowed the build up of the toroidal field which in turn gave strong collimation of the outflow . at later times in the simulation , the twist of the field relaxed , but the matter pressure force continued to push matter along the collimated magnetic field lines .",

    "<S> stationary magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) outflows from a rotating accretion disk are investigated numerically by time - dependent axisymmetric simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the initial magnetic field is taken to be a split - monopole poloidal field configuration frozen into the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the disk is treated as a perfectly conducting , time - independent density boundary [ @xmath0 in keplerian rotation . the outflow velocity from this surface </S>",
    "<S> is not specified but rather is determined self - consistently from the mhd equations . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the matter outflowing from the disk is small in the region where the magnetic field is inclined away from the symmetry axis ( @xmath1 ) , but relatively high ( @xmath2 ) at very small radii in the disk where the magnetic field is not inclined away from the axis . </S>",
    "<S> we have found a large class of stationary mhd winds . within the simulation region , the outflow accelerates from thermal velocity ( @xmath3 ) to a much larger asymptotic poloidal flow velocity of the order of one - half @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the central object and @xmath6 is the inner radius of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> this asymptotic velocity is much larger than the local escape speed and is larger than fast magnetosonic speed by a factor of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ acceleration distance _ for the outflow , over which the flow accelerates from @xmath8 to , say , @xmath9 of the asymptotic speed , occurs at a flow distance of about @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the outflows are approximately spherical , with only small collimation within the simulation region . </S>",
    "<S> the _ collimation distance _ over which the flow becomes collimated ( with divergence less than , say , @xmath11 ) is much larger than the size of our simulation region . </S>",
    "<S> close to the disk the outflow is driven by the centrifugal force while at all larger distances the flow is driven by the magnetic force which is proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the toroidal field .    </S>",
    "<S> our stationary numerical solutions allow us ( 1 ) to compare the results with mhd theory of stationary flows , ( 2 ) to investigate the influence of different outer boundary conditions on the flows , and ( 3 ) to investigate the influence of the shape of the simulation region on the flows . </S>",
    "<S> different comparisons were made with the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the ideal mhd integrals of motion ( constants on flux surfaces ) were calculated along magnetic field lines and were shown to be constants with accuracy @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> other characteristics of the numerical solutions were compared with the theory , including conditions at the alfvn surface .    </S>",
    "<S> different outer boundary conditions on the toroidal component of the magnetic field were investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the commonly used `` free '' boundary condition on the toroidal field leads to artificial magnetic forces on the outer boundaries , which can significantly influence to the calculated flows . </S>",
    "<S> new outer boundary conditions are proposed and investigated which do not give artifical forces .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that simulated flows may depend on the shape of the simulation region . </S>",
    "<S> namely , if the simulation region is elongated in the @xmath15direction , then mach cones on the outer cylindrical boundary may be partially directed inside the simulation region . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , the boundary can have an artificial influence on the calculated flow . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is reduced if the computational region is approximately square or if it is spherical . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of mhd outflows with an elongated computational region can lead to _ artificial _ collimation of the flow .    </S>",
