    "temperature and finite - size effects on the phase structure of physical systems can be described by quantum - field models defined in spaces with toroidal topologies .",
    "the starting point is the quantum theory of systems at finite temperature , both in the imaginary - time ( matsubara )  @xcite and real - time  @xcite formalisms .",
    "since correlation functions should satisfy periodicity conditions on the time coordinate , known as kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) conditions , the finite - temperature theory is defined on the compactified manifold @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a circumference with length proportional to the inverse of the temperature and @xmath2 is the euclidean 3-dimensional space .",
    "compactification of spatial dimensions  @xcite is considered in a similar way .",
    "an unified treatment , generalizing various approaches dealing with finite - temperature and spatial - compactification concurrently , has been constructed  @xcite by rigourously considering field theories on toroidal topologies @xmath3 , with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) being the number of compactified dimensions and @xmath6 the dimension of the space - time .",
    "these methods have been employed to investigate spontaneous symmetry - breaking induced by temperature and/or spatial constraints in some bosonic and fermionic models describing phase transitions in condensed - matter , statistical and particle physics ; for instance , for describing the size - dependence of the transition temperature of superconducting films , wires and grains  @xcite ; for investigating size - effects in first- and second - order transitions  @xcite ; and for analyzing size and magnetic - field effects on the gross - neveu ( gn )  @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl )  @xcite models , taken as effective theories  @xcite for hadronic physics  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the massive gn model , modified by the inclusion of a @xmath7 term in the hamiltonian  @xcite , at finite temperature and density .",
    "this model has been considered to investigate color superconductivity , with possible applications to neutron - star structure  @xcite and to chiral symmetry - breaking in hadronic systems  @xcite . also , a rich phase structure , including bcs- and bec - like phases , in strongly interacting matter has been obtained with an extended njl model having six - fermion interaction  @xcite . besides , such kind of interaction might be of relevance to systems in condensed matter where gn and njl models are used , like graphene  @xcite and quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "in all these cases , fluctuations due to finite - size play an important role in the phase structures .    here , our aim is to discuss the finite - size effects in the extended gn model by considering compactification of spatial coordinates .",
    "we investigate the existence of first- and second - order phase transitions in this model and study their dependence on the relevant parameters : the temperature , chemical potential and the size of the system .",
    "we perform a study of the critical behavior of this model as a field theory on a toroidal space .",
    "we take the space - time dimension @xmath8 and consider the particular case of two compactified dimensions ( @xmath9 ) , imaginary time and one spatial coordinate .",
    "we find that , besides the usual symmetry restoration which occurs in the standard gn model , inverse symmetry - breaking happens in the extended model ; in both cases , there exists a minimal size of the system below which the phase transition disappears .",

    ", we must have @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( to ensure stability of the system ) , with the mass @xmath32 satisfying the condition @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , for consistency , to have a first - order phase transition we must require that @xmath34 .",
    "on the other hand , we can recover a second - order transition for @xmath35 , but in this case we must have @xmath36 and the transition is characterized by @xmath37 in the disordered phase and @xmath38 in the ordered phase .",
    "we can not have simultaneously @xmath39 and @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ july092 ] ) , otherwise the stability of the system is lost .",
    "it is to be noted that the choice of @xmath41 for the free - space mass at zero temperature and chemical potential corresponds to choosing whether we start with the system in the ordered ( @xmath42 ) or the disordered ( @xmath43 ) phase .",
    "we shall consider the simplest approximation where the coupling constants are taken as fixed , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with temperature , chemical - potential and finite - size changes only appearing in the self - energy corrections of the mass term .",
    "then , the free - energy density becomes @xmath46    finite temperature and density corrections to the self - energy can be evaluated by using the matsubara imaginary - time formalism .",
    "the cartesian coordinates are specified by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a @xmath49-dimensional vector .",
    "the conjugate momentum of @xmath50 is denoted by @xmath51 , @xmath52 being a @xmath49-dimensional vector in momentum space .",
    "the kms conditions , carrying the anti - periodicity for fermions , imply that the feynman rules are modified by the well - known matsubara prescription  @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 are matsubara frequencies and @xmath55 ; this corresponds to the compactification of the imaginary time in a circumference of length @xmath56 .",
    "we shall also investigate finite - size effects by considering the compactification of one spatial coordinate ( @xmath57 ) in a length @xmath20 using the generalized matsubara prescription @xmath58 here we have chosen anti - periodic boundary conditions for the spatial compactification , instead of the simpler periodic ones , because they emerge naturally in the generalization of the kms conditions satisfied by correlation functions for fermionic fields in toroidal topologies  @xcite .",
    "we consider corrections to the mass to first order in the coupling constants .",
    "this means that there are only two relevant contributions to the self - energy , one proportional to @xmath13 , and other proportional to @xmath14 ; these contributions correspond the  tadpole \" and the  shoestring \" diagrams shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , at the lowest order in the coupling constants , the finite temperature , chemical - potential and size dependent self - energy is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are respectively the contributions from the tadpole and the shoestring diagrams .",
    "we initially consider an arbitrary space - dimension @xmath6 and later reduce to @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noticed that the extended gn model is not perturbatively renormalizable in dimensions greater than two .",
    "however , it can be considered as an effective model and lowest - order calculations can be performed using an appropriate cut - off or , equivalently , a convenient minimal subtraction procedure , to discuss temperature , chemical - potential and size effects on its phase structure .",

    "not including the six - fermion interaction , we find a second - order phase transition with the critical temperature depending strongly on the strength of the quartic self - interaction .",
    "considering the system with one compactified spatial dimension , we find that there is a minimal length below which the phase transition is suppressed and the system remains in the disordered phase for all values of the temperature ; this characteristic length depends on the strength of the quartic self - interaction but it is independent of the value of the chemical potential .    for the extended model , including a six - fermion self - interaction , we show that a first - order phase transition may exist , separating a low - temperature condensed phase from a high - temperature disordered phase , for a range of values of the coupling constants such that @xmath156",
    ". however , in this case , there is also a second branch of the transition line , as illustrated in the left panel of fig  [ fig4 ] , where the system reenters the condensed phase at even higher temperatures , a situation corresponding to an inverse symmetry - breaking . on the other hand , for @xmath157 the transition occurs always in this unusual way , with the low-@xmath158 phase being disordered and the high-@xmath158 one being ordered , while for @xmath138 no transition exist . in what the inverse symmetry - breaking is concerned",
