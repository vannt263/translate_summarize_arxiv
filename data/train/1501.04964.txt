    "at high enough energy , particles passing through matter ( cosmic rays through the atmosphere , high - energy partons through a quark - gluon plasma , electrons through an electromagnetic calorimeter ) lose energy primarily through splitting : hard bremsstrahlung or pair production which , when repeated , produces a shower of lower energy particles .",
    "naively , one would calculate the rate @xmath5 for each such splitting by ( roughly speaking ) computing the cross - section @xmath6 for splitting during a collision between the high energy particle and a particle in the medium , as in the bremsstrahlung process depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : brem ] , and then finding @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density of things to scatter from and @xmath9 the relative velocity . the flaw in this argument , as known since the 1950s , is that the duration of this splitting process , called the formation time , grows with energy . at high enough energy , the formation time exceeds the mean free time between collisions with the medium , and then consecutive scatterings from the medium",
    "may no longer be treated as quantum mechanically independent for the purpose of computing the splitting rate .",
    "this is known as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite , which dramatically suppresses the splitting rate at very high energy . in the language of feynman diagrams ,",
    "the lpm effect represents important interferences between splitting before and after a sequence of elastic collisions with the medium , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lpm1]a for qed and fig .",

    "for consistency with future figures , we have used blue for high - energy particles in the amplitude and red for high - energy particles in the conjugate amplitude . ]    a natural question that arises is whether consecutive splittings of the high energy particle , and not merely consecutive collisions with the medium , occur within the formation time .",
    "that is , once we use the lpm or bdmps - z formalism to compute the rate for a single splitting , can we then treat consecutive splittings as independent and so simply use the single - splitting rate in a monte carlo to compute the development of the shower ( which we need for answering detailed questions about energy loss ) ? or is there instead a significant contribution from processes where the formation times associated with consecutive splittings overlap , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] ?",
    "formally , the probability of a splitting is parametrically of order @xmath10 ( @xmath11 in qcd ) in one formation time , and so the formation time is one power of @xmath10 smaller than the typical time between consecutive splittings , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical ] .",

    "formation times shrink as bremsstrahlung gluons become soft . ) ]    note that in the last figure we have drawn only the high - energy particles .",
    "this will be our convention throughout the rest of the paper : the collisions with the medium are implicit , and the high - energy particle lines should be understood as decorated with numerous interactions with the medium , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lpm1 ] .",
    "our goal in this paper is to develop formalism for a full computation of the lpm effect ( to include the treatment of overlapping formation times ) in the case of two consecutive splittings , such as fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] .",
    "we will then implement this formalism to compute results for double - splitting rates in qcd in certain simplifying limits , to include the multiple - scattering approximation ( also known as the @xmath1 or harmonic oscillator approximation ) , which is appropriate for typical events at high energy when the medium is much thicker than the mean free path for collisions with the medium .",
    "previous authors @xcite have performed explicit calculations for qcd to leading - log order in the limit of @xmath12 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the momentum fractions of two of the final gluons .",
    "[ that is , if the initial parton energy is @xmath13 , the three daughters after the two splittings have energies @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . ]",
    "these results have interesting and important consequences , which we will briefly mention later .",

    ", we study the problem of general @xmath3 and @xmath4 , without requiring that either be small , and we will carry out explicit calculations in that case . in the context of the multiple - scattering ( harmonic oscillator ) approximation , we will be able to go beyond leading logarithms and develop methods for explicitly computing the full result for double splitting .      in this , our first paper on the case of general @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we will simplify the discussion by focusing on the case of the large @xmath0 limit of qcd .",

    "] for the sake of a minor , further simplification , we will also focus on the case where the initial high - energy particle is a gluon rather than a quark ( and so , in the large-@xmath0 limit , all the daughter particles after each splitting are gluons as well ) .",
    "though we will develop formal results that are more general , our explicit calculations in this paper will be specialized to the case of a thick , static , homogeneous medium .",
    "`` thick '' means that the medium is wide compared to the typical formation length .    finally , in this first paper",

    "another unusual feature of the effective quantum mechanics problem is that it has a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "as the particles propagate , they interact with the background fields in the plasma . for a thermal medium ( or other random medium ) , these background fields are random with well - defined correlations .",
    "when computing a rate in a random background , one should average the rate over that randomness ( e.g.  average over the thermal ensemble ) .",
    "after this average , the interactions of the particles with the background fields , and their correlations , may be replaced by a `` potential energy '' term in the quantum mechanics problem , as we will later review more concretely .",
    "a potential in non - relativistic quantum mechanics represents an instantaneous correlation in our problem .",
    "this is a valid approximation in our problem because the time it takes for high - energy particles to cross one correlation length of the medium is parametrically small compared to the formation time in the high - energy limit .",
    "the dynamics of the high - energy particles on the time scale of the formation time is what is relevant to our calculation .",
    "] however , unlike a normal quantum mechanics problem , this potential energy is not real - valued .",
    "the effective quantum mechanics problem that reproduces the medium - averaged splitting _ rate _ ( rather than the unaveraged splitting _ amplitude _ ) has a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",

    "the other non - trivial feature that we want to mention is that individual interference contributions , such as each of those in fig .",

    "using the translations of table [ tab : wu ] , one may verify that wu s formula ( 21 ) for relating @xmath1105 to @xmath1106 is equivalent to the @xmath721 limit of our formula ( [ eq : changef ] ) [ with ( [ eq : cmodes ] ) and ( [ eq : af ] ) ] for relating @xmath511 to @xmath303 .       with these translations , we find that the @xmath12 limit for the @xmath1096 version of ( [ eq : iixyyx ] ) , combined with ( [ eq : cprop1 ] ) , reproduces ( [ eq : wu ] ) . however , for @xmath1108 , we find some differences .",
    "one difference is that wu ( 20 ) is missing a factor of the jacobean of the transformation between the variables @xmath1106 and @xmath1105 [ as can be seen by taking the @xmath1109 limit , in which all the green functions become @xmath365-functions ] .",

    "( these contributions correspond respectively to the second diagram in wu ( 31 ) @xcite and the third diagram in wu ( 32 ) , and they correspond to @xmath1118 and @xmath655 of blaizot and mehtar - tani @xcite . ) a simple indication of the problem can be found by comparing ( i ) our potential ( [ eq : vlarge4 ] ) applied to the @xmath17 limit of @xmath47 or @xmath554 to ( ii ) the potential of wu ( 17 ) .",
    "consider @xmath47 , where our notational convention ( [ eq : xhat ] ) was that @xmath180 is the position of the @xmath4 gluon and @xmath952 is the position of the @xmath3 gluon . in the @xmath17 limit ,",
    "the two harder particles stay extremely close together ( relative to other transverse distance scales ) , corresponding to @xmath1119 . adopting wu s convention of using @xmath1120 for the separation of the @xmath3 parton from the hard partons ( our @xmath1121 in this case ) , and @xmath208 for the @xmath4 parton from the hard partons ( our @xmath1122 here ) , the corresponding limit of ( [ eq : vlarge4 ] ) is @xmath1123 this does not agree with wu s @xmath1124 .",
    "\\label { eq : vwu}\\ ] ] the reason for the discrepancy is that wu assumes that the two hardest particles form a color dipole with total color in the _ adjoint _ representation a. when those particles are gluons , however , they could in principle form a dipole in any color state contained in a@xmath1125a , which contains many more possibilities than a itself ( especially in the large @xmath0 limit ) .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : color]a ( which is drawn by distorting fig .",
    "[ fig : xyyxrate ] into a style similar to wu s diagrams to depict relative transverse separations ) . in this picture",
    ", the initial singlet dipole first emits a gluon and must become an adjoint dipole to balance color .",
    "the emission of the second gluon in principle allows the dipole to become anything in a@xmath1125a .",
    "however , all of these possibilities other than a itself will be suppressed by the small dipole size once we also add in virtual processes where the @xmath4 boson connects to the other particle in the dipole , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : color]b .",
    "since in this paper we are just computing @xmath1005 ( for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and not energy loss , we have not included virtual processes , and so the other color possibilities are not suppressed .",
    "the color dynamics of our calculation is therefore different than wu s , which makes it difficult to directly compare partial results .",
    "( the same holds for comparison to blaizot and mehtar - tani . )",
    "( a ) a depiction of possible total dipole color at different times for @xmath47 for the case @xmath721 .",
    "( b ) a virtual correction to single bremsstrahlung that conspires to suppress the range of dipole color possibilities in energy loss calculations . ]    for @xmath1126 , however , all is well , as depicted in fig .  [ fig : colorz ] : in the @xmath17 limit , the calculation of @xmath544_{z y\\bar y\\bar z}$ ] is also restricted to an adjoint color dipole at intermediate times . on a related note ,",
    "following the numbering convention of ( [ eq : x1234zyyz ] ) , @xmath1127 for @xmath17 , and our @xmath3 and @xmath4 gluons correspond to @xmath147 and @xmath180 respectively .",
    "wu s @xmath1120 is then our @xmath1128 , and his @xmath208 is our @xmath1129 . in this limit ,",
