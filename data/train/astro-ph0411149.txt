    "a young star grows within a complex environment , accreting from a circumstellar disk and driving jets out through a surrounding envelope of dust and molecular gas .",
    "fast rotation and a fully - convective structure also distance the emerging star itself from the familiar sun . the impact of these circumstances upon a stellar magnetic dynamo , the structure of magnetic field on the star and in its immediate environment , and resultantly the location , temperature , and amount of x - ray - emitting hot plasma within the system is yet to be well established . as the x - ray emission is in turn",
    "expected to be the key agent for ionization of circumstellar material , understanding the interaction of these processes is important in understanding the early stages of stellar evolution .",
    "studies of the x - ray emission from stars in star - forming regions ( sfrs ) have produced conflicting results as to whether young stars do ( e.g. @xcite ) or do not ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) demonstrate the same dependence of x - ray luminosity on rotation as main - sequence stars , and as to whether accretion or the presence of a circumstellar disk does ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) or does not ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) suppress the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the conflict has been variously attributed to : real physical differences between different sfrs ; biases in sample selection ; and incorrect assumptions ( e.g. source spectrum , absorbing column density ) in calculating x - ray luminosities .",
    "our survey of the sword of orion examines a region of star formation intermediate in star density and mass distribution between the rich , orion nebula cluster ( onc : @xcite ; @xcite ) , centrally concentrated on massive o - type stars whose strong uv radiation may affect evolution of circumstellar material of lower - mass stars , and the sparser taurus molecular cloud ( @xcite ) , lacking in high - mass stars .    in this paper ,",
    "we show preliminary results from the survey , including the x - ray and near - infrared ( nir ) source content of the field , and examples of spectral and temporal analyses of individual sources .",
    "the survey consists of four _ xmm - newton _ fields covering a region @xmath0@xmath1 . an optical image ( fig .",
    "[ fig_opt_image ] ) of the survey area shows the extensive nebulosity , including the orion nebula itself , associated with the star - formation activity in this region . in three fields",
    "all three epic instruments ( pn and both mos cameras ) were exposed in full - frame mode for @xmath2 ks ; in the field centred on the onc ( ) itself only the mos cameras were exposed in partial window mode for 36 ks .",
    "each event - list was filtered to exclude events with bad flags and patterns , and times of high background . for each observation ,",
    "an image in the 0.34.5 kev band was created for each operating instrument , and these were mosaicked to make an epic image .",
    "source detection was performed using the science analysis system ( sas ) tasks ewavelet and emldetect .",
    "figure  [ fig_epic_image ] shows a mosaic of the epic survey images . the optically - brightest star in the survey , , is the bright x - ray source in the southernmost survey field",
    "we have detected over 850 x - ray sources in the survey .",
    "we performed cross - correlation of the x - ray source list with 2mass sources in the survey area .",
    "more than 700 have 2mass counterparts within 6 arcsec , the vast majority having the photometric properties of young stars ( fig .  [ fig_2mass ] ) .",
    "a small fraction of the x - ray - detected stars show the @xmath3-band excess expected of circumstellar disks ; a few show extreme @xmath3-band excess indicative of further circumstellar material and an early stage ( class i ) of evolution .",
    "much work has been done to characterize the stars in this region by spectral type , mass , age , reddening , rotation period , circumstellar environment ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by studying the dependence of x - ray luminosity , @xmath4 , ( particularly normalized to a star s bolometric luminosity , @xmath5 ) on these parameters we aim to understand the mechanisms driving the x - ray and magnetic activity of these young stars .",
    "analysis of the northernmost field in the survey found no clear dependence of @xmath4 or @xmath6 on rotation period ( @xcite ) , in contrast to that of ms solar - like stars .",
    "this suggests a different dynamo mechanism is at work .",
    "however , the rossby numbers ( ratio of rotation and convective turnover periods ) of these fully - convective stars are consistent with those of saturated - emission solar - like stars , whose high levels of activity ",
    "@xmath7  also show no rotation dependence .",
    "analysis of this subsample also found that low - mass stars ( @xmath8 m@xmath9 ) showing an excess of @xmath10-band continuum emission ( @xcite ) , expected from material that is heated as it accretes onto a star , had lower median @xmath6 , by a factor @xmath11 , than stars showing no such significant excess ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that accretion plays a role in suppressing the observed x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite have proposed that columns of accreting material obscure underlying coronal emission , i.e. the absorbing column to x - rays , @xmath12 is higher than would be anticipated from the observed visual extinction , @xmath13 .",
    "we aim to test this though spectroscopic analysis of strongly- and weakly / non - accreting samples . in a small sample",
    "studied so far , we have found the @xmath12 derived from spectral fitting is no more than that expected from optical absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fig_nh ] ) .      through spectroscopic analysis , we also aim to assess the temperature of the x - ray - emitting plasma of bright sources and investigate its dependence on rotation period and evolutionary stage .",
    "solar - like ms stars show increasing coronal temperature with decreasing rotation period ( or rossby number ) .",
    "@xcite found that x - ray - bright young stars in earlier evolutionary stages ( class i ",
    "ii ) had higher plasma temperatures than those in later stages ( class iii ) .",
    "few class ii objects have been studied with high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy : while ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) also show hot temperatures , has remarkably cool plasma ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec_p1778 ] shows a pn spectrum of , an approximately 0.75  myr - old solar analog ( according to the models of @xcite ) .",
    "the star s 2mass photometry shows small excesses in the @xmath14 and @xmath3 bands , suggestive of a small circumstellar disk , but there is a strong @xmath10-band excess ( @xcite ) indicative of a high accretion rate ( @xmath15  m@xmath9yr@xmath16 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is very high , @xmath17  ergs@xmath16 , with @xmath18 . a two - temperature fit to the pn spectrum , using the elemental abundances of a very active near - ms star (;",
    "@xcite ) requires the hot component to be at @xmath19  mk , a temperature observed on ms stars only transiently in very large flares , yet the pn lightcurve of does not indicate that such a flare occured during this observation .    a number of such flares are observed in the survey ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_p2215 ] ) .",
    "hydrodynamic modelling of the temperature and emission measure of the flare plasma during the decay phase allows estimation of the size of magnetic loop involved ( @xcite ) .",
    "loop sizes larger than the stellar radius may indicate the flare occurred in magnetic structure bridging the star and a circumstellar disk , or within the disk itself , rather than in a coronal loop on the star .",
    "an _ xmm - newton _ survey of the sword of orion star - forming region has yielded over 850 x - ray sources , of which more than 700 have near - infrared counterparts consistent with being young stars .",
    "analysis of a subsample of the survey has indicated that these young stars do not show the activity  rotation relation of solar - like ms stars , and that accretion suppresses the observed x - ray emission of young stars .",
    "absorption of x - rays does not appear to be larger than expected from observed optical extinction .",
    "extremely hot plasma temperatures of @xmath19  mk are found on at least one young solar analog .",
    "statistical investigations , using the whole sample , of the dependence of x - ray emission levels and plasma temperatures on fundamental stellar parameters and environmental features are being pursued , and detailed analysis of large flares aims to identify the emission region in these systems .    financial support from the swiss nsf ( grant 20 - 66875.01 ) is acknowledged .",
