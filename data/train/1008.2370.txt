    "an emerging trend in the quest for viable ways to implement quantum information processing ( qip ) tasks @xcite is to envisage physical scenarios where the demanded level of control is significantly reduced .",
    "a well - known major hindrance to the reliable accomplishment of quantum coherent operations stems from the noise that any demanded manipulation of quantum  hardware \" inevitably introduces whenever a given task is to be achieved . within this framework ,",
    "an approach that is becoming increasingly popular is to encode the computational space in the ( pseudo ) spin degrees of freedom of scattering particles and harness their interaction during the collision to process quantum information @xcite .",
    "scattering is indeed a typical phenomenon occurring under low - control conditions : two or more particles are prepared so as to undergo scattering and eventually measured once this has concluded .",
    "therefore , no direct access to the very interaction process is available . unlike gated qip @xcite where one assumes full control over interaction times to implement one- and two - qubit operations ,",
    "a distinctive feature of scattering - based strategies is that any action is performed with no interaction - time tuning @xcite .",
    "further advantages of this approach @xcite are the remarkable resilience against a number of detrimental effects such as static disorder and imperfect setting of resonance conditions @xcite , detector efficiency @xcite and decoherence affecting the centers @xcite .    evidently , the price to pay is that in quantum scattering the internal spin degrees of freedom of the scattering particles , i.e.  those used to encode information , inevitably couple to the motional dynamics .",
    "hence , in general , such processes affect the state of the colliding spins according to quantum maps , instead of unitary operations .",
    "this makes the accomplishment of qip tasks , and more in general coherent operations , rather demanding . indeed ,",
    "while the works carried out along this line targeted entanglement generation @xcite and quantum state tomography @xcite only latest achievements have proved the possibility to perform a quantum _ algorithm _ such as teleportation @xcite .",
    "the working principle behind this recent proposal , however , basically relies on a scattering - based effective projective measurement of the singlet state of two remote scattering centers @xcite , i.e.  the same basic mechanism underpinning previous works that addressed entanglement generation @xcite .",
    "our main motivation in the present paper is to assess whether or not a scattering - based scenario such as the one depicted above can allow for a far more ambitious task : the implementation of a two - qubit gate ( tqg ) . indeed , while this usually quite demanding quantum operation is well - known to be key to the settlement of a model for universal quantum computation @xcite , a scattering scenario appears a hostile environment for its achievement due the above - outlined non - unitary spin dynamics .",
    "aware of such conditions , our main goal in this paper is to provide a proof - of - principle study to establish the possibility to implement a tqg in a simple paradigmatic model , which can serve as a milestone for forthcoming developments . to tackle the problem , we focus on a setup consisting of a quantum impurity and a mobile particle , the latter being able to propagate along a one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire .",
    "we assume a spin - spin heisenberg - type contact potential such that whenever the particles undergo scattering their spin degrees of freedom mutually interact . as a significant outcome ,",
    "we show how basic constraints for the occurrence of quantum gates such as linearity and unitarity can be formulated in terms of spin - dependent transmission coefficients through a single , concise and physically intuitive condition . after showing that this is matched by a rather broad set of parameter patterns ,",
    "we show that its fulfillment can be given a straightforward explanation in a specific regime on which we will mostly focus in this paper .    clearly , assuming monochromatic particles , the detrimental effect of the motional degrees of freedom in the 1d scattering process is to split the spin dynamics into a reflection and a transmission channel . hence , similarly in some respects to other scenarios @xcite and in the spirit of the general paradigm of measurement - based quantum computation @xcite , here our approach is to search for the occurrence of a two - channel probabilistic tqg , i.e.  a gate that performs one out of two given unitary operations with some associated probabilities ( these are in fact reflectance and transmittance ) .",
    "although our primary concern is to answer the question whether a tqg can occur regardless of its matrix form , we show that gates able to establish maximum entanglement in both the reflection and transmission channels are actually possible under certain conditions .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ setup ] we present the aforementioned set - up and briefly discuss the approach that we adopt to describe its scattering dynamics . in sec .",
    "[ conditions ] we derive the condition to fulfill in order for tqgs to occur . in sec .  [ gates ] , with regard to the setting introduced in sec .",

    "a narrow potential barrier lie at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "once injected into the structure , @xmath4 undergoes multiple reflections between @xmath1 and the potential barrier during which its spin couples to @xmath1 . eventually , @xmath4 is transmitted forward or reflected back .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we consider a 1d quantum wire along which a flying spin-1/2 particle @xmath4 can propagate .",
    "a quantum impurity @xmath1 , modeled as a spin-1/2 scatterer , lies at @xmath5 , whereas a narrow potential barrier is located at @xmath6 ( the @xmath0-axis is along the wire ) .",
    "the whole setting is sketched in fig .  1 .",

    "it is straightforward to check that regardless of @xmath27 the normalization condition is fulfilled , namely    latexmath:[\\[\\label{norm }     in the above calculations , we have in fact used the coupled basis , namely the common eigenstates of @xmath28 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are eigenstates of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( henceforth we omit the particle subscripts ) . as the singlet and triplet",

    "in general , due to the coupling between the spin and motional degrees of freedom during scattering , neither @xmath48 nor @xmath47 represent a unitary operator within the overall spin space . rather , they are the matrix representations of two kraus operators , which because of the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) fulfill    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the 4@xmath164 identity matrix .",

    "( [ nonlinear ] ) brings about that @xmath48 and @xmath47 , in general , act in a nonlinear way , which would rule out the fulfillment of another essential requirement for a gate , namely linearity .",
    "one may however wonder whether there exists a _",
    "specific _ regime in the setup described in sec .",
    "[ setup ] such that unitarity and linearity occur together , a circumstance that we will show to actually take place . to this aim",
    "we consider the explicit form of the transmittivity @xmath55 in eq .",

    "furthermore , using eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) we see that in such a case @xmath62 is fulfilled as well . in the above regime , once rescaled operators are defined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the spin state evolves in the transmission ( reflection ) channel according to @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is immediate to check that    @xmath67    i.e.  both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are unitary .    summarizing ,",
    "we have found that the simple condition ( [ maincond ] ) is enough to ensure both linearity and unitarity of the transmission and reflection channels .",
    "this has indeed a reasonable interpretation due to the implicit requirement that , clearly , in order to implement a quantum gate a mere path measurement over @xmath4 must provide zero information about the overall spin state of @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is also clear that this takes place provided that for each state of a given basis , say @xmath45 , the mobile particle is transmitted ( reflected ) with the same probability ( and hence so happens for any spin state ) , a circumstance which looking at eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) we see to be equivalent to condition ( [ maincond ] ) .",

    ", we will clearly elucidate the mechanism through which the static barrier compensates for this drawback .",
    "we conclude this section by showing what class of quantum gates can be implemented by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ maincond ] ) . as this requires that the transmittivity ( reflectivity ) needs be the same in the singlet and triplet subspaces , the only effect of scattering is to give rise to a relative phase shift .",

    "as is evident , the condition ( [ maincond ] ) occurs in each case addressed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] whenever the plotted curves intersect the @xmath90-axis .",
    "remarkably , when @xmath97 [ see fig .  [ fig2](c ) ] provided that @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) the condition for the occurrence of quantum gates is satisfied regardless of @xmath98 , which is of course an attractive feature for the demand of low control .",
    "insight into this phenomenon can be given through a simple reasoning as follows .",
    "under the resonance conditions ( rcs ) @xmath100 the effective representations of the two dirac delta functions appearing in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) coincide according to    @xmath102    where the subscripts remind that these are effective forms under rcs ( for a proof see refs .",
    "@xcite , where an analogous effect has been shown to be useful for qip tasks ) .",
    "hence , in the light of eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) under rcs the system behaves as if the static potential lay at the @xmath1 s site . in such a case , using eqs .",

    "( [ 1barrier ] ) . when @xmath107 , however , a closer inspection at eq .",
    "( [ 1barrier ] ) shows that for a single delta - like barrier @xmath108 the modulus of the transmission coefficient only depends on @xmath109 .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ maincond ] ) is fulfilled when    @xmath110    which is indeed equivalent to @xmath97 regardless of @xmath98 , thus explaining the aforementioned behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) . a more explicit and illustrative way to see",
    "this is noticing that under rcs the effective hamiltonian can be arranged as    @xmath111\\delta_{rc}(x)\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    when the initial spin state is @xmath112 or @xmath113 the factor between brackets takes the value @xmath114 , which results in the effective potential - barrier height @xmath115 . on the other hand , @xmath116 fulfill    @xmath117    it is now immediate to see that the static barrier , whose presence is embodied by the constant term @xmath92 between the brackets in eq .",
    "( [ otra ] ) , in fact cancels out the ising term for @xmath97 .",
    "when this takes place the effective potential - barrier height seen by @xmath116 becomes @xmath118 , whose modulus is the same as the one associated with @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the above reasoning also shows , in particular , that the replacement of a heisenberg - type spin - spin coupling with an @xmath119-isotropic one in hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can not give rise to any quantum gate either with no extra barriers or with a @xmath120-like barrier under rcs .",
    "indeed , in the heisenberg case one deals with only two independent transmission coefficients ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) and hence the single condition ( [ maincond ] ) needs to be fulfilled to implement gates . in the @xmath119-isotropic model , however , _ three _ independent coefficients in general arise since the spin - spin scattering potential vanishes for both @xmath123 and @xmath124 and takes the effective value @xmath118 for @xmath125 [ see eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) ] . in the light of our discussion in sec .",
    "[ conditions ] , we see that in the case of @xmath119-isotropic model gates occurrence results in two equations to be fulfilled .",
    "absence of gates under rcs with such a model is therefore not surprising given that setting of rcs in fact freezes the parameter @xmath90 : judicious setting of the remaining free parameter @xmath13 is enough to fulfill the single equation required by the heisenberg model , but not the two ones met with @xmath119-isotropic coupling .        having identified a regime compatible with eq .",

    "a question that is naturally raised from the matrix structure in eq .",

    "this question had so far remained fully unanswered in the literature . with these motivations in mind ,",
    "we have considered a minimal paradigmatic set - up comprising a flying spin scattering from a quantum impurity along with a further spinless potential barrier . in a way similar to other scenarios where proposals for probabilistic quantum gates were put forward @xcite",

    "we have also given the full class of resulting gates .",
    "next , numerical evidence has been given that the above theoretical condition is actually matched for suitable parameter patterns in both off - resonance and resonance conditions .",

    "finally , we have shown that such maximally entangling gate is robust against imperfect matching of the optimal parameters .",
    "as anticipated , a significant implication of our findings is the ability of certain occurring gates to establish maximum entanglement .",
    "entanglement between a static and a flying qubit offers the major advantage of being particularly prone to a robust bell test since once scattering has happened the two particles can get significantly far apart from each other .    in this work ,",
