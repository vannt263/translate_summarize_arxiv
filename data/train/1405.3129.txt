    "recently , nanomechanical resonators ( namrs ) have attracted considerable attention both theoretically and experimentally , due to the fact that namrs own both classical and quantum properties @xcite , which provides unique opportunity for studying quantum properties in macroscopic objects .",
    "generating large quantum superposition of the macroscopic objects is an essential task in the field of the macroscopic quantum mechanics rmp-84 - 157,pra-88 - 033614 , rmp-85 - 471,prl-110 - 160403 , which provides a good platform to understand the mechanism of decoherence in macroscopic objects @xcite , to check the scope of application of quantum theory @xcite and to observe the transition between quantum and classical physics @xcite . to this end ,",
    "the large quantum superposition , like the schrdinger cat state ( simply called cat state in the following ) , has been realized in various systems , such as trapped ions @xcite , photons @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , macroscopic current @xcite , and namr @xcite . however , those schemes are based on the dynamical evolution which is sensitive to quantum fluctuations and definitely unsuitable for preparing macroscopic quantum states . therefore , it is desirable to find a robust way to creating the cat state against the quantum fluctuation .",
    "on the other hand , the geometric phase is only determined by the path of the state evolution , rather than the initial state distribution or any details of the path @xcite . in this way , operations and processes based on the geometric phases are robust to the fluctuation and some other imperfections in the evolution pra-58 - 65,nature-448 - 784,nature-406 - 43,nature-464 - 697,njp-15 - 043025 .",
    "so far there are two kinds of geometric phases .",
    "the one taking no dynamical phase is called conventional geometric phase @xcite , where removing the dynamical phase from the evolution is essential to the related operations . as a result , although the geometric phase is intrinsically resistant to parameter fluctuation , the additional operations for eliminating the dynamical phases usually bring in unexpected errors . in contrast , the so - called unconventional geometric phase @xcite remains a non - zero dynamical phase proportional to the geometric phase by a constant independent of the parameters . as a result , despite involvement of the dynamical phase , all geometric advantages are still possessed in the processing with unconventional geometric phase .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate the possibility to generate the cat state by displacement operators from the unconventional geometric phase gate ( defined later ) in the hybrid system consisting of a charge qubit@xcite and a namr .",
    "although we have realized that the unconventional geometric phase has been achieved in the system of trapped ions @xcite , which is analogous to the model under our consideration , the method working there is not applicable to the namr due to much bigger mass of the namr making the coupling to the charge qubit negligible .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that the unconventional geometric phase is not robust against the qubit decay , i.e. , the charge noise . to overcome this problem",
    ", we consider a transmon - type charge qubit in our work , which is insensitive to the charge noise due to a large ratio of the josephson energy to the charging energy @xcite .",
    "the decay time of this kind of charge qubit can reach 0.1 ms experimentally @xcite .",
    "different from the previous schemes involving the unconventional geometric phase @xcite for quantum computation , our scheme focuses on generating the cat states based on the displacement operators in a geometric fashion , which guarantees the robustness of the cat states of the namr .",
    "moreover , in comparison with a recent proposal pra-88 - 033614 in which the cat state is created in an optomechanical cavity , the cat state generated in our hybrid system composed of a charge qubit and a namr can be more macroscopic. in addition , there is a controllable coupling between the namr and the charge qubit , which can be adjusted by the bias voltage on the namr .",
    "therefore , the namr and the charge qubit can be decoupled after the cat state is generated . as a practical aspect",
    ", we suppose that the namr owns a very high frequency , which ensures the namr remaining in the ground state in the work temperature of the charge qubit .",
    "assisted by the operations based on the unconventional geometric phase with a transmon - type charge qubit , our scheme is robust against the fluctuations from the external light field within the coherence time , and very promising for achievement using currently available techniques .",

    "e.g. from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , the state regarding the phonon mode of the namr first evolves from a vacuum state to a coherence state , and then evolves back to the vacuum state again .",

    "this is because we just focus here on generating entangled cat states between the namr and charge qubit by means of the state - dependent displacement operation in a geometric fashion , rather than based on the phases .",
    "nevertheless , the unconventional geometric phase gate operation guarantees the robustness of the entangled cat state for the namr and charge qubit in the next section .",

    "figure [ fidelity ] ( a ) means that the fidelity of the entangled cat state is sensitive to the decays of the charge qubit and the namr , and the unconventional geometric phase gate can be robust against the parameter fluctuation rather than the qubit decay .",

    "( eq106 ) ] .",
    "provided fixed rabi frequencies regarding the driving fields and the namr , the phonon coherent state can be very large if @xmath93 is very small .",

    "in contrast , if @xmath93 is very large , the operation time can be very short , but the average phonon number in the entangled state is very small . as a trade - off , the detuning @xmath84 must be chosen carefully to be small enough but make sure the operation to be finished within the decoherence time of the system .",
    "considering the parameters in figure [ fidelity ] , we may set the operation time @xmath131 @xmath52s , and then we can find that the lowest average phonon number of the entangled cat state in our simulations is @xmath132 ( see the lowest point in red dashed - dotted line in figure [ fidelity ] ( b ) ) . in the absence of decoherence and parameter fluctuations",
    ", the corresponding maximal value of @xmath133 in figure [ fidelity ] can reach 1.0 , which is larger than @xmath134 proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , there are some other factors affecting the fidelity of the generated entangled cat state under the noisy environment .",
    "these factors include the uncertainties and fluctuations of the parameters , which can change the average phonon number in the coherent state . as an example , we have calculated in figure [ fidelity](a ) the influence due to @xmath120 fluctuation in the rabi frequency , which demonstrates the robustness to the fluctuations to some extent .",
    "particularly , we find that @xmath121 fluctuation of the rabi frequency ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) corresponds to a higher fidelity of the entangled cat state , which is due to the fact that the average phonon number in the coherent states is proportional to the rabi frequency @xmath135 , when the operation is performed within the time for finishing a quarter of a rabi oscillation .",
    "this implies that the less rabi frequency leads to less average phonons in the coherent state ( see figure [ fidelity ] ( b ) ) , which is less sensitive to the decay of the namr .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations in figure [ fidelity ] show that the validity of our scheme is restricted by the charge qubit decay , since the scheme based on the geometric phase is never robust against the qubit decay .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown the possibility to achieve the cat state of the namr in a namr - charge qubit system .",
    "the key point of our scheme is the employment of the state - dependent displacement operator based on the unconventional geometric phase gate , which makes the cat state generated with a geometric feature . as a result",
    ", our scheme owns some distinct advantages , such as the robustness against the parameter uncertainties and fluctuations , the feasibility of the ground state of the namr in the work temperature of the charge qubit , independent control of the charge qubit and the namr , and the possibility of producing large cat states .",
    "in addition , our scheme can also be extended to the von neumann measurement based on geometric feature of the operations @xcite .",
    "particularly , we argue that our scheme can be achieved using currently available techniques .",
