    "as applications of network science continue to grow and the cost of large data sets decreases , complex network models are increasingly moving from a useful means for building insights @xcite to a powerful tool for control and prediction @xcite .",
    "however , the false and missing links that often plague these data sets may pose a challenge to the application of complex network models .",
    "for example , networks based on mobile phone records @xcite may miss important highly connected hubs due to a lack of institutional phone numbers , while social media - based networks may show friendships between people where no face - to - face friendship exists .",
    "thus , characterizing the reliability of network properties inferred from measured data with link errors can be an important issue .",
    "this is a challenging problem as there is often no  true \" network to compare against and only an estimate of the link errors can be made .",
    "biological networks , in particular , are often constructed from noisy data .",
    "for example , recent high - throughput technologies such as yeast two - hybrid screening now make it possible to test potential interactions between proteins in a organism ; however , depending the stringency of the screening , the number of reported protein - protein interactions can vary dramatically @xcite . when the number of reported interactions is on the high end , many false links are likely to be included , and when the number of reported interactions is on the low end , many true links are likely missed .",
    "further , interactions can also be missed when they are conditioned on other events in the cell .",
    "link errors are also common in the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from gene expression microarray data ; in particular , false links are frequently inferred from non - causal correlations @xcite .    while much attention has been devoted to improving network reconstruction algorithms to limit the number of false and missing links @xcite , in this paper we aim to provide a step toward understanding the effect of these link errors on the conclusions we draw from network analysis .",
    "we study the effects of false and missing links on three different network measures of node importance : degree centrality , betweenness centrality , and dynamical importance , which are described below .",
    "in general , our goal is to understand the extent to which a node importance measure calculated using a noisy network correlates with its value in the true network . in particular",
    ", we wish to determine how measures of node importance differ in their robustness to false and missing links . in this section",
    "we describe the different measures of node importance considered , the different types of  truth \" networks studied , and the different models for false and missing links employed .",
    "we limit our considerations to unweighted , undirected networks with no self - links .",
    "the number of links connected to a node is its degree , the most basic centrality measure .",
    "the use of degree has been especially popular in identifying the function of genes in genetic regulatory networks .",
    "genes with many links can play important roles in multiple biological functions @xcite . in social networks a node s number of acquaintances or friends reflects the local influence of that node .",
    "more global measures of node centrality account for a node s neighbors , neighbors of neighbors , and so on .",
    "_ betweenness centrality _ is such a measure .",
    "the betweenness centrality of a node _",
    "i _ is defined as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of shortest paths between nodes _ j _ and _ l _ going through _ i _ , and @xmath2 is the total number of shortest paths between _ j _ and",
    "_ l_. by summing over all pairs _",
    "j , l _ we have the fraction of shortest paths that run through _ i_.    one might consider a centrality measure that effectively takes into account all paths instead of only shortest paths .",
    "there are multiple eigenvalue metrics @xcite that account for such paths .",
    "we focus on the _ dynamical importance_. the dynamical importance of node _",
    "i _ is defined in terms of the decrease , @xmath3 , of the largest eigenvalue , @xmath4 , of the network s adjacency matrix upon the removal of node _",
    "@xcite : @xmath5 the dynamical importance measure is motivated by the observation that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix plays an important role in various processes on networks , including synchronization of oscillators @xcite and phase transitions in boolean models of gene regulatory networks @xcite .      in our investigations of the effects of network noise in the form of link errors on the aforementioned centrality measures , we two types of widely - studied networks as our  truth \" networks .",
    "the first type is an erdos - renyi ( er ) @xcite random network . to construct an er network with @xmath6 links we randomly choose @xmath6 pairs of nodes and draw an edge between each pair",
    "this kind of network exhibits a poisson degree distribution if the number of nodes is large .",
    "the other type of truth network we explore is the scale - free ( sf ) network , which exhibits a power - law degree distribution . to construct our sf networks , we start with a directed variant of the barabsi - albert preferential attachment model @xcite .",
    "our network begins with a small random seed network to which a single new node is added at every time step .",
    "when each new node is added , two directed links originating from it are made to existing nodes in the network .",
    "these connections are formed such that the probability of linking to an existing node is proportional to its current in - degree .",
    "we then convert this directed network to an undirected network.the resultant network exhibits a degree distribution that is power law in its tail with exponent @xmath7 ( in contrast to the @xmath8 exponent for the original barabsi - albert construction @xcite ) .      in order to explore how link errors affect centrality measures , we consider two models for creating missing and false links",
    ".    for both of our link error models , denoted model 1 and model 2 , we create missing links by randomly selecting @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of the @xmath6 true links and deleting them .",
    "models 1 and 2 , however , differ in how false links are created . in model 1",
    "we create false links by connecting @xmath11 node pairs randomly selected from among the @xmath12 node pairs not connected by a true link . from the nodes point of view",
    ", the expected number of its links that get deleted is proportional to its degree in the truth network , while the expected number of links added is independent of its degree . in our second model of noisy networks ( model 2 ) , _ both _ the deletion and addition of links occur in proportion to node degree .",
    "thus in model 2 false links are added between node pairs where each node in the pair is randomly selected with probability proportional to the node s true degree .",
    "that is , we randomly choose two nodes with probability proportional to their degree ; if the two choices do not already have a connecting link , we add a link between them .",
    "we repeat this process until @xmath11 links have been added .    in what follows",
    "we will vary the link deletion fraction @xmath13 and the link addition fraction @xmath14 to numerically ( sec . [",
    "sec : sims ] ) and analytically ( sec .",
    "[ sec : anl ] ) explore the effects of missing and false links . while @xmath10 , note that @xmath14 can be larger than @xmath15 .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to @xmath16 and hence do not consider noisy networks for which the number of false links exceeds the number of true links . because some centrality measures are not well - defined when there are multiple disconnected components in a network , only nodes in the giant connected component ( gcc ) of both the true and noisy network are considered .",
    "in this section , we report results of numerical simulations investigating the robustness of network centrality measures in the face of link errors for the two different types of truth networks and the two link error models considered . using the methods described in sec . [",
    "sec : appr ] , we generated erdos - renyi networks with with @xmath17 nodes and average degree @xmath18 and scale free networks with @xmath19 nodes and average degree @xmath20 .",
    "starting with each of these truth networks , we then produced noisy variants for different values of @xmath13 ( the fraction of true links deleted ) and @xmath14 ( the fraction of false links added ) .",
    "for all values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 , results from the noisy networks were averaged over 25 realizations .      to assess the effect of link noise on a node s centrality measure @xmath21 , we calculated the pearson correlation @xmath22 between the true measure @xmath23 and noisy measure @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath21 denotes either the node s degree centrality , betweenness centrality , or dynamical importance , and @xmath26 indicates an average over nodes in the giant connected component of the network .",
    "we used the standard definitions of degree centrality and betweenness centrality from section [ sec : appr ] when calculating the correlation @xmath22 . in the case of dynamical importance",
    ", we employed a perturbation - based large-@xmath27 approximation @xcite of eq .",

    "the betweenness , and especially the dynamical importance , become even less sensitive to false link additions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "results using model 1 link errors on sf truth networks ( figs .",

    "in contrast , with false link additions ( @xmath14 increasing ) , we find that the correlation actually _",
    "increases_. e.g. , for the case of degree ( fig . [ corpanel](a ) ) , this occurs because model 2 noise is added in proportion to the signal we are measuring ( the true degree ) , and this effect can also be seen for the betweenness centrality and dynamical importance measures ( figs .",

[ 4panel](d ) that at fixed @xmath38 the scale - free network is largely unaffected by the addition of false links for both model 1 and model 2 .",
    "in addition to correlation robustness , we have also characterized the effect of link errors on the overlap between the top 10% of nodes in the truth and noisy networks when ranked based on a given centrality measure .",
    "this consideration of overlap is motivated by the fact that node - ranking is often used to select nodes for further study or experimental validation ( e.g. , see the gene network study of human glioma in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    with this motivation",

    ", however , we may be interested in how the centrality of a specific node in the noisy network is related to its centrality in the true network . in this section ,",
    "we address such situations .",
    "to assess the effects of link errors on the centrality of a specific node with true degree @xmath40 , we consider the set of nodes in the true network with degree @xmath40 , and for each node in that set , take the ratio of its centrality measure ( e.g. , betweenness ) in the noisy network to the same measure in true network . after repeating the process for 500 realizations of the noisy network ( constructed from a single underlying truth network , randomly generated as described in section [ sec : model_nets ] ) , we obtain a distribution of the noisy / true centrality ratios for a given value of @xmath40 . we do this for both er and sf true networks . for both models , we focus on an example in which the expected number of false links added is equal to the expected number of true links deleted ( @xmath41 )",

    "[ nodepanel2 ] .    for model 1 ,",
    "in which false links are added independent of node degree and true links are removed proportional to node degree , we see that , in both er and sf networks , the median noisy / true ratio exhibits a general downward trend as @xmath40 increases .",
    "this trend occurs because low degree nodes are less likely to have links removed than high degree nodes while being equally likely to have links added . for the betweenness and dynamical importance measures ( figs .",
    "[ nodepanel1](c , d , e , and f ) ) , we see that for large degrees the median ratios are very close to 1 .",
    "since the first and third quartile boundaries are also reasonably close to 1 at large @xmath40 , this implies that for higher degree nodes , the betweenness and dynamical importance of a specific node in the noisy network are good predictors of its corresponding measure in the true network , in the case ( @xmath42 ) that the total number of links in the noisy network is approximately equal to the number of links in the true network .    for model 2 ,",
    "in which both link additions and deletions are proportional to the original degree , the median noisy / true ratio approaches one at large degree for all centrality measures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nodepanel2 ] . for degree and betweenness centrality",
    ", we see that the first and third quartiles are roughly symmetric about the median , whereas for dynamical importance , the third quartile is significantly further from the median than the first , indicating a right - skewed distribution of noisy / true ratios for a given value of degree @xmath40 .",
    "the scatter observed for betweenness and dynamical importance ratios in sf networks ( figs .",
    "[ nodepanel2](d and f ) ) occurs because the noisy networks are built from a single random realization of the true network .",
    "in this section , we derive analytic approximations for the pearson correlation @xmath22 of degree centrality before and after the addition of noise and for the probability distribution function of the noisy node degree .",
    "we derive our analytic approximations for both models of link errors studied and show that the predictions of our analytic approximations are consistent with the numerical results presented in the preceding section .    as described in sec .",

    "however , because this procedure is hard to analyze , to facilitate the theory we employ a closely related canonical procedures that should yield results that are good approximations to the actual model 1 and model 2 results .",
    "specifically , for link deletion , each one of the @xmath6 true links is deleted with probability @xmath13 .",
    "thus the _ average _ number of missing links is @xmath9 with fluctuations whose ratio to the average decreases as @xmath44 , and we expect a good approximation for link deletions when @xmath45 .",

    "if we delete each true link with a probability @xmath13 , then the probability that @xmath47 links are deleted from a node with true degree @xmath40 is @xmath48 next we consider model 1 link addition . for large @xmath27",
    ", the probability of adding @xmath49 false links to a node is approximately given by a poisson distribution , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the average number of false links per node , @xmath52 , while for model 2 the probability that a randomly chosen node has @xmath49 false links is @xmath53    from our knowledge of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , eqs .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the effect of two types of link errors on three node centrality measures .",
    "we propose two simple models of link error ( labeled model 1 and model 2 ) and study their effect for two types of network topology ( erdos - renyi and scale - free ) . in model 1 ,",
    "the probability that a link is deleted depends on the original number of links to which that link is connected , while false links do not depend on the structure of the original network .",
    "model 2 follows the same formulation as model 1 for deleting links , but in model 2 the addition of false links is performed with a probability that is proportional to the product of the true degrees of the node pairs .",

    "we have obtained analytical results ( sec [ sec : anl ] ) which are in good agreement with our numerical simulation results .",
    "the analytical and numerical results for the correlation suggest that degree centrality , betweenness centrality , and dynamical importance are relatively robust to the presence of false edges when the network is scale - free .",
    "our result for the relative insensitivity of sf networks to @xmath13 is consistent with previous work showing that the size of the giant component in sf networks has a high tolerance to the random removal of nodes @xcite .",
