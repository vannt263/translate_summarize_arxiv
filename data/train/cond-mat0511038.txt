    ", we discuss various predictions of the spin - drift - diffusion model .",
    "although strain and magnetic fields both lead to electron spin precession , spin precession due to strain differs qualitatively from that due to a magnetic field because spin - strain coupling depends linearly on the electron wave vector @xmath66 whereas spin - magnetic field coupling is independent of electron wave vector . for spin precession in an applied magnetic field",

    "the precession angle is correlated with electron velocity and therefore with the electron s position .",
    "there is a partial cancelation of accumulated precession angle during the parts of the diffusive path that are traversed in the opposite direction , due to the linear dependence of effective magnetic field on electron momentum .",
    "indeed , for motion strictly in one dimension , the spin ensemble would not dephase at all ( however , it would still decohere with a timescale @xmath63 ) . scattering from @xmath67 to @xmath68 simply reverses the direction of precession , leading to an exact correspondence between spatial position and spin orientation .    a second difference between spin precession due to strain and that due to magnetic field is that for spin - magnetic field coupling the spatial precession length increases with increasing electric field ( drift velocity ) , whereas for spin - strain coupling this length scale is independent of electric field .",
    "for spin - magnetic field coupling , the spin precession frequency is independent of electric field , but because the electrons drift faster in a larger electric field , the spatial precession length increases .",
    "for spin - strain coupling , the precession frequency scales directly with the average electron velocity , so that the spatial spin precession length is nearly independent of electric field .    to illustrate these differences , we consider the simple geometrical case in which spins are generated by a stripe optical excitation along the y - axis , the electric field @xmath69 , the magnetic field @xmath70 and off - diagonal strain @xmath4 is generated by stress applied along @xmath71 ( a [ 110 ] crystal axis ) . for this geometry ,",

    "all _ injected spins ( e.g. , the case of optical spin injection and detection via spatially - integrated luminescence polarization ) , in these studies the injection source and the point of detection may be spatially separated , so that only a subset of the injected electrons are detected by the probe laser .",
