    "similar features were found in cool members of young open clusters , e.g. , ngc 2516 @xcite and pleiades @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies of the radii and effective temperatures between observations and models are thought to be due to presence of magnetic activities at high level @xcite , e.g. , existence of large and cool magnetic starspots @xcite , and/or strong magnetic fields inhibiting convection @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the validity of starspot model by comparing the loci of active cool members of ngc 2516 and pleiades , and inactive field stars in color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) ; if starspots are the sole cause for radius inflation detected in these highly magnetically active cool stars , it needs a very large spot coverage ( e.g. , 0.35 - 0.51 ) .",
    "starspots can cause light variation due to its rotational modulation .",
    "however , some young low - mass stars with high levels of chromospheric activity show no spot modulation .",
    "@xcite showed detail analysis on 210 low - mass stars with detected periods and 144 low - mass stars without detected periods in the young open cluster ngc 2516 , found no significant differences in their positions on cmds , the distribution of their @xmath5 , and their levels of chromospheric activity , suggested that the lack of spot modulation may be due to high axi - symmetric distributions of starspots being in very small angular length scale ( e.g. @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",

    "the spectra of m - type stars are dominated by molecular bands , oxides ( mainly tio , vo ) , metal hydrides ( e.g. , cah ) , and metal hydroxides ( caoh ) . @xcite",

    "later papers by @xcite and @xcite expanded on this spectrum synthesis modelling technique . for illustrative purpose , here we give a simple description of this technique .    the observed total flux from a star with inhomogeneous temperature photosphere ( e.g. , two - temperature structure : cool spotted region and hot quiescent region ) can be expressed by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the stellar radius , @xmath35 is the distance from us , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the specific intensity of spotted and quiescent photosphere , respectively .",

    "correspondingly , the observed relative flux ( with nearby pseudo continuum band @xmath42 ) can be predicted as @xmath43 assuming that @xmath38 is independent of wavelength , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the relative strength of spotted and quiescent photosphere , respectively , and @xmath46 denotes the contrast of continuum surface flux between the spotted and quiescent photosphere .",
    "@xmath47 is the fractional coverage ( projected area ) of spotted region on the observed hemisphere ( also called spot filling factor ) .",

    "@xmath81900 objects with apass @xmath104 magnitudes ( apass dr9 , * ? ? ?",
    "we then derived their @xmath101 values from @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath68 and @xmath97 colors using color-@xmath17 relations from parsec models @xcite with 5 gyr and solar metallicity .",
    "@xmath25 magnitudes for entire sample are retrieved from 2mass archive @xcite .",
    "we compared their @xmath101 values with @xmath100 values , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : teffph_sp2 ] and noticed that estimated @xmath101 values based on color-@xmath17 relation are color - dependent . on average , the difference between these two temperature scales ( @xmath101-@xmath100 ) approximately vary from -30 k to 50 k for respective colors from @xmath105 to @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , by comparing @xmath101 from @xmath97 with @xmath100 from tio5@xmath98 for pleiades candidate members , we found that these two temperature scales are consistent with each other .",
    "however , considering @xmath97 color is susceptible to spottedness , @xmath17 from this color could be underestimated by 20 - 50 k for m - type pleiades stars ( see appendix  [ sec : teffq ] ) . in this case , the effective temperatures of m dwarfs in current work may be systematically underestimated by about 50 k. such a systematic deviation of about 50 k in m dwarfs temperature would not affect the estimation of spot coverage severely for active g / k - type stars , but would result in large uncertainties for m - type pleiades members , as discussed in the text .     from broad band colors , @xmath105 ( left ) and @xmath97 ( right ) , and @xmath100",

    "pleiades probable single members and binary / non - member stars are shown as filled and open squares with dot , respectively , in right panels . ]",
    "the cool spots on the stellar surface contribute light that affect spectral features and broad - band colors , thus derived effective temperature @xmath17 becomes the `` average '' surface temperature ( flux - weighted mean temperature ) in spotted stars .",
    "in other words , for a star with surface covered with large cool spots , the @xmath108 must be larger than @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that pleiades k and m dwarfs have anomalous spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that differ from inactive counterparts .",
    "the striking sed feature is that these cool dwarfs have blue excesses also slight red excesses , which account for the observed blueward displacement in @xmath109 color and redward displacement in @xmath110 color , respectively .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed these findings using new @xmath111 photometry .",
    "@xcite proposed that this sed anomaly may be due to presence of more than one photospheric temperature in pleiades cool members , e.g. , the `` normal '' quiescent photosphere with both cool ( spot ) and warm region ( plage ) , or simply warmer quiescent photosphere ( warmer than it would be if it were not spotted ) with cool spotted region .",
    "therefore , it is a challenge to determine definite quiescent photosphere temperature for a spotted star .",
    "fortunately , unlike the anomalous @xmath109 and @xmath110 colors , the @xmath112 is less influenced by the spot @xcite , which may be a result of balance of the warm and cool components on the stellar surface .",
    "therefore , in this work , we estimated @xmath108 using @xmath96 for most of the pleiades candidates ( 223 members have @xmath96 colors ) ; if @xmath96 is unavailable , we then estimated @xmath108 from a corrected effective temperature based on other colors ( see the following text ) .",
    "thus , we used @xmath97 as second choice ( e.g. , 48 members with no @xmath96 have @xmath97 colors ) , considering the fact that @xmath97 is a good indicator of @xmath17 for low mass stars @xcite .",
    "if @xmath97 is also not available , @xmath68 was used as third choice and @xmath113 as the last choice .    for members in sample-1 , we first adopted @xmath104 and @xmath24 magnitudes from catalogue of @xcite , and updated with new homogeneous @xmath104 and @xmath24 magnitudes from @xcite . for members in sample-2",

    "we added apass johnson v and sloan @xmath114 magnitudes for members when required .",

    "all these magnitudes are dereddened using the extinction of pleiades @xmath115 ( correspondingly , @xmath30=0.10 , @xmath116=0.07 , @xmath117=0.01 mag , based on the extinction law of @xcite & @xcite with @xmath118 ) .",
    "we noticed that five stars ( hii 476 , hii 625 , hii 676 , hii 1039 , hii 1136 ) in our sample have been known to have large reddening @xcite , which lie in or near the small region of the merope co cloud running into the pleiades @xcite .",
    "therefore , for these five stars , we dereddened their colors using the reddening value provided by @xcite .",
    "the corresponding color-@xmath17 relations were estimated from the parsec models of @xcite with an age of 120 myr and solar metallicity .",

    "isochrones from @xcite and @xcite are plotted .",
    "note the cit system k - band magnitudes from @xcite have been transformed to 2mass k - band magnitudes using the transformation equation reported by @xcite .    to check for any offsets among different color - resultant @xmath17 values , e.g. , the difference due to the influence of spottedness , and any potential intrinsic systematic errors due to the theoretical color-@xmath17 relations , we compared @xmath17 values from @xmath97 , @xmath68 and @xmath113 ( hereafter @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 respectively ) with @xmath17 values from @xmath96 color ( @xmath26 ) for pleiades stars ( see right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : teffph_color ] ) .",
    "note there exist differences between these @xmath17 values .",
    "for instance , on average , @xmath27 are 20 - 100 k lower than @xmath26 through m to gk spectral types .",
    "we estimated offsets from @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 to @xmath26 values by linear fitting and applied to the members with no @xmath96 color and got their @xmath26-like values ( hereafter @xmath119 ) . in the lower right panel ,",
    "we showed the comparison between derived @xmath26 & @xmath119 values and @xmath100 values ( for members with spectral type earlier than k7 , @xmath100 were derived by lasp ; for k7 and m - type stars , @xmath100 were estimated from their @xmath120 ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath26 ( & @xmath119 ) are averagely hotter than @xmath100 , as expected .",
    "however , broad - band colors based @xmath17 of some members are largely underestimated , e.g. , for hhj 435 @xmath26 @xmath8 3570 k , while its spectrum indicates that it should be a late - k or early m type star , being consistent with @xmath121 k estimated from @xmath120 . in fact , hhj 435 lies in the area of the merope co cloud , indicating this star is probably effected by large reddening . for the stars outside the co cloud region , the large deviation in @xmath101 indicate that the colors maybe affected by heavy spottedness , or simply indicate they are binaries / non - member stars . in this paper , for these 39 stars with @xmath26 ( & @xmath119 ) of 100 k lower than @xmath100 , we simply adopted the @xmath100 as @xmath108 , instead of @xmath26 or @xmath119 .",
    "the adopted @xmath108 along with @xmath17 from different colors are listed in table  [ tab : objects_results ] and table  [ tab : objects_list ] .    to identify potential binaries and non - members , we first preferred @xmath104 versus @xmath96 cmd , further @xmath104 versus @xmath97 as second choice , then @xmath114 versus @xmath68 and @xmath24 versus @xmath113 are used as third and last choices . based on empirical single - star loci of pleiades in these cmds shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : teffph_color ] ( if available , the average single - star loci of values provided by @xcite and @xcite were used , and the single - star loci in @xmath114 vs. @xmath68 cmd were derived based on the sample of @xcite ) , brighter stars with @xmath122 in one cmd ( e.g. , @xmath123 in @xmath104 vs. @xmath96 cmd ) were classified as probable binary members , while the fainter stars with @xmath124 or very much brighter stars with @xmath125 were identified as probable non - member stars , as flagged in table  [ tab : objects_list ] .",
    "equation  [ equ : ftotal ] shows that the observed relative flux of any molecular band , @xmath53 , depends on both the intrinsic strength of spot , @xmath55 , and the contrast of nearby continuum surface flux between the spotted and quiescent photosphere , @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , just as noted by @xcite , to be a better diagnostic for cool spot , a molecular band should not only be intrinsically strong , but the contrast of continuum surface flux should be large enough to produce a measurable signal in the observed spectra",
    ". therefore , these intrinsically strong molecular bands in the red spectral region are more useful for measuring spot parameters .",
    "in fact , late - k and m - type dwarfs have numerous strong molecular bands in the red spectral region , like the cah bands near 6380    ( cah1 ) and 6800    ( cah2 ) , tio bands near 7050    ( tio2 , tio5 ) , 7600    and 8860    ( hereafter tio7600 and tio8860 ) .",
    "however , considering their strong temperature - sensitivity over a wide temperature range but weak gravity - sensitivity , tio bands are ideal diagnostics of cool spots . moreover , comparing with other tio band systems like tio7600 and tio8860 in the red spectral region , tio bands near 7050    have strong temperature - sensitivity over very wide temperature range ( e.g. , from @xmath8k5 to m7 ) and marginally susceptible to telluric lines or strong metal lines .",
    "therefore , we took the tio bandhead of 7050    as the `` best '' band for measuring cool spot parameters for pleiades cool members .",
    "the bandhead of 7050    consists of three strong absorption subbands , namely , tio2 , tio3 and tio4 . comparing with tio2 , tio3 and tio4",
    "are slight weaker , particularly , the pseudo - continua of these two bands are susceptible to bluer bands ( e.g. , tio2 eats the pseudo - continuum of tio3 ) .",
    "tio5 , measuring the full depth of this tio band system , is thus stronger than any of those three bands , e.g. , the depth ratios of tio2n to tio5n are in the range of 0.5 to 0.7 for m dwarfs with temperature from @xmath126 k to 3000 k. in other words , it is easier to detect signals of cool spot from the tio5 index , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : results_tio5n ] .",
    "one can see more extra absorption from tio5 than tio2 for g / k- and early m - type active stars and pleiades members . for cooler active stars and pleiades members ,",
    "tio5 is similar to tio2 ( or even weaker ) , which maybe partly due to weaker temperature - sensitivity of tio5 , also partly due to the systematic underestimate of temperatures for these active stars ( since we estimated their temperatures using cah2@xmath98 and tio5@xmath98 ) . in this study",
    ", we have estimated spot coverages using tio2 and tio5 bands for pleiades members , and are listed in table  [ tab : objects_results ] .",
    "we compared the resultant spot filling factors from tio2n and tio5n , and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results_tio2n_tio5n ] .",
    "similar spot coverages are seen , from these two indices , for stars of late - g to early - m pleiades members . for hotter or cooler member stars ,",
    "as expected , results from tio5n and tio2n show opposite behaviours .",
