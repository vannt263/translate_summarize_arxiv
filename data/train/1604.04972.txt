    "the lateral p - n - junctions in field - effect transistor ( fet ) structures with a graphene layer ( gl ) channel and split gates  @xcite can be used in new electron and optoelectronic devices .",
    "for example , the tunneling electron - transit diodes for generating terahertz radiation ( thz )  @xcite , interband thz photodetectors  @xcite , and injection thz lasers  @xcite have been proposed and analyzed .",
    "recently  @xcite , the thz emission from split - gate gl - fet structures with forward biased p - n- junctions was observed .",
    "similarly , graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) and graphene bilayer ( gbl ) fet structures with p - n junctions can be used in different devices  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity of the current - voltage characteristics of the gl  @xcite and gbl p - n - junctions  @xcite can be used for detecting thz radiation using the effect of the current rectification and for the thz generation using the tunneling negative differential conductivity . since the gated regions of p- and n - types form the plasmonic cavities  @xcite , the excitation of the plasmonic oscillations ( the oscillations of the electron or hole density and the self - consistent electric field ) by incoming thz radiation can substantially affect the detector characteristics due to the plasmonic resonances",
    "an idea to use the plasmonic properties of the electron ( or hole ) system in the channel of a fet for the resonant thz detection was brought forward a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "the key points of this idea are : ( 1 ) the resonant excitation of the plasmonic oscillations and ( 2 ) the rectification of the ac current is due to the hydrodynamics nonlinearity of the electron system dynamics in the channel .",
    "later , the concept of fet - based thz detectors was successfully realized and such detectors based on iii - v compound materials with the enhanced characteristics were manufactured and used in applications  ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the concepts of using the combination of plasmonic effects and other types of the current nonlinearity ( stronger than the hydrodynamic nonlinearity ) were also considered .    due to unique electron properties of gls , gnr , and gbls  @xcite and a remarkable progress in fabrication of different transistor heterostructures based on gls , such fets can be used for thz detectors ( and frequency multipliers ) with enhanced performance  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the gl - based heterostructures are associated with the enhanced mobility at room temperature ( about 110,000  @xmath0/v s in the epitaxially grown gls on sic substrate  @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a high quality factor of the plasmonic oscillations at room temperature and high frequencies of the plasma modes in relatively long channels due to the elevated plasma - wave velocity  @xcite .",
    "besides higher room - temperature quality factors compared to those for the fet - detectors based on the standard materials , the symmetry of the hole and electron energy spectra provides an opportunity to realize coherent coupled plasmonic oscillations in the p- and n - sections of the device .",
    "the vertical gl - based structures can also be used for the resonant plasmonic thz detection  @xcite .",
    "the gnr transistor structures  @xcite can serve the basis for the thz detectors using different operational principles  @xcite , including the resonant absorption of thz radiation  @xcite leading to the rectification and bolometric effects .",
    "high quality factor of the plasmonic oscillations in gl - heterostructures , opens up the prospect of realization of the room - temperature thz detectors exhibiting pronounced resonant behavior due to the plasmonic effects with very high peak responsivity and strong spectral selectivity .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the proposed resonant thz detector based on lateral split - gate gl - fet and split - gate fet with the gl perforated between the gates ( pgl - fet ) in which the channel is partitioned into the p- and n - type sections .",
    "the operation of such detectors is enabled by the nonlinearity of the p - n - junction and the excitation of coupled plasmonic oscillations in the gated channel sections .",
    "we demonstrate that the responsivity of the gl - fets under consideration as function of the incoming thz radiation frequency can exhibit the resonant response . however , the height of the spectral dependence responsivity peaks and their sharpness are rather moderate .",
    "this is because of relatively high conductance of the p - n junction in the gls associated with the interband tunneling can be compared with the conductance of the channel .",
    "in contrast , in the pgl - fets the tunneling mechanism can be effectively suppressed by appropriate choice of the energy gap in the perforated portion of the channel ( perforated depletion region of the p - n junction ) .",
    "apart from this , the thermionic conductance of the p - n junction is also limited by the channel nanoconstrictions . as a result",
    ", the net conductance of the p - n junction can be much smaller than that of the gated channel sections that is beneficial for the achievement of pronounced spectral selectivity and elevated peak responsivity .",
    "in fets with undoped gl - channel and with the split gates , the formation of the lateral p - n junction is realized by applying voltages @xmath1 and @xmath2 between the source and the neighboring gate section ( source gate section ) and between the drain and the drain gate section .",
    "figure  1 shows the gl- and pgl - fets , which can be used for the thz detection and their band diagrams at properly chosen applied gate voltages .",
    "the main feature of the pgl - fets is the energy band gap in the depletion region caused by the gl perforation substantially affecting the conductivity , nonlinear , and plasmonic properties of the p - n - junction ( as in fets based on heterostructure made of the standard materials  @xcite ) .",
    "this region can be considered as an array of the nanoconstrictions or gnrs similar to the gnr channels of fets  @xcite and bolometric detectors  @xcite .",
    "the source - drain voltage comprises the dc and ac signal components : @xmath3 is applied between the side contacts , where @xmath4 is the dc bias voltage in the case of photocurrent detection and the dc signal voltage produced by the incoming radiation in the photovoltaic regime , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the amplitude and frequency of the ac signal received by an antenna .",
    "we assume that the steady - state hole and electron densities in the gl channel , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are equal to each other : @xmath9 .",
    "if , in addition , both the gates have similar length , @xmath10 , and due to the symmetry of the hole and electron energy spectra , the plasmonic properties of the p- and n - channel sections are similar . in this case , the plasmonic oscillations in the p- and n - channel sections can be synchronized .",
    "if the length of the gates @xmath10 and the net length of the channel @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are markedly larger than the gate layers thickness @xmath13 , one can apply the gradual channel approximation  @xcite . assuming that the two - dimensional hole system ( 2dhs ) in the p - section and two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in the n - section of the gl channel are degenerate , one can write down the following equations for the hole ( in the p - section ) and electron ( in the n - section ) density in the undoped channel @xmath14 ( at zero dirac point ) :    @xmath15    here we set @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 is the electron charge , @xmath19 is the dielectric constant of the gate layer material , and @xmath20 is the hole and electron fermi energy in the pertinent channel sections . the fermi energy is equal to @xmath21 , where @xmath22  cm / s is the characterisctic velocity of electrons and holes in gls , and @xmath23 is the planck constant .",
