    "astrophysical black holes are characterised by just mass and spin",
    ". the measurement of spin requires observations which probe the immediate environment of the black hole event horizon .",
    "two methods which have emerged using current x - ray observations of luminous accreting black holes rely on fitting either the shape of the reflection component of the spectrum including a broad iron line , or the shape and the flux of the quasi - blackbody continuum .",
    "both assume that the accretion disc extends in to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , the radius of which is determined by the black hole spin .",
    "the reflection fitting method essentially measures the largest gravitational redshift of the disc , which comes from the isco , and yields that radius in units of gravitational radii ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the continuum fitting method measures the area of the inner disc and obtains the radius of the isco in km . here",
    "we apply the reflection method to suzaku x - ray data of the first stellar mass black hole , cyg x-1 .",
    "early attempts to measure the spin parameter of cyg x-1 using the reflection method led to inconsistent results ( miller at al 2005 ; miller et al 2009 ) . adopting a newtonian emissivity profile ( surface flux on the disc varies with radius @xmath7 as @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) and using a special timing mode of xmm , a recent measurement by duro et al .",
    "( 2011 ) gives a dimensionless spin parameter , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the angular momentum and mass of the black hole , respectively .",
    "] of @xmath12 .",
    "recent results using the continuum fitting method have been obtained by gou et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "they find a near extreme black hole with @xmath13 the work relies on accurate optical determinations of the mass ( @xmath14 ) and inclination ( @xmath3  deg ) obtained by orosz et al ( 2011 ) .    here",
    "we study the reflection / iron line approach in detail , taking account of the relativistic effects on the emissivity profile expected if the black hole spins rapidly .",
    "such effects demand that the emissivity be steep if the disc extends to the innermost region within @xmath15 ( wilkins & fabian 2011 ) .",
    "we find @xmath16 , which is a higher than , but marginally consistent with , that reported by duro et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "both reflection results are consistent with the continuum fitting result of gou et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "we find the disc to be fairly highly ionized with an ionization parameter around 1800  erg  cm  s@xmath17 , which means that the reflection spectrum is dominated by a large edge due to ionized iron .",
    "this blurred edge carries information about spin in the spectral fit .",
    "early work emphasised how this edge can be important in fitting the spectrum of cyg x-1 ( ross , fabian , brandt 1996 ) .",
    "the dataset we use is one of the 20 suzaku observations of cyg x-1 analyzed by miller et al ( 2012 ; the observation of 2009 apr 8) .",
    "the focus of that work is not on measuring the black hole spin , but rather studying the detailed disc - jet coupling in cyg x-1 .",
    "the spectra in that work have been fitted with a relativistically - blurred reflection model , but in order to make the work tractable , the fits kept the source inclination and iron abundance frozen at 27 deg and 1 , respectively .",
    "the emissivity profile of the blurring function was also just a single power - law , fixed for the newtonian value of 3 .",
    "we relax these assumptions here and apply them to an average dataset .",
    "we later tested the model on several other datasets ( 2009 may 6 , 25 and dec 1 ) and obtained consistent results .",
    "the best fit to the 1500  kev spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "1 and values of key parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "the model used , constant*tbabs*mtable(windabs.fits)(gaussian+gaussian + diskpbb+powerlaw+kdblur2f*atable(extendx.mod ) ) highecut , is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "kdblur2f is a fast adaptation by jss of the broken power - law emissivity convolver kdblur2 .",
    "extendx is a version of the self - consistent slab reflection model reflionx ( ross & fabian 2005 ) extended to allow the photon index to be less than 1.4 .",
    "( we do not use the refhiden models of ross & fabian 2007 , which incorporate a blackbody component because they are only available for solar abundance iron and at the blackbody temperature found here for the low state of about 0.16  kev the differences are minimal . ) absorption features due to the stellar wind of the companion ( e.g. , hanke et al . 2009 , nowak et al . ,",
    "2011 ) are modeled using windabs.fits ( miller et al . , 2012 ) and we refer to that paper for further details .",
    "the absorption has little effect on our results .",
    "we note that the highecut model used to fit the data above 100  kev is phenomenological and is not strictly consistent with the 300  kev exponential cutoff assumed by the extendx model , but has limited effect on the results presented here .",
    "the quality of the fit is very good , and the emissivity index @xmath4 is found to be high @xmath18 .",
    "the inclination of @xmath2  deg is consistent with the optical measurement of orosz et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "it is clear that the spectrum is reflection - dominated below 10  kev ( fig .",
    "2 ) , although the whole source , from an energy point of view integrating over the whole spectrum , is not reflection dominated .",
    "this is a consequence of the hard irradiating continuum where much of the energy absorbed from compton recoil due to photons at @xmath19 is emitted by the surface layers if the disc below 6  kev .",
    "the ratio of the 0.11000  kev flux from the reflection component is 0.70 times that from the power - law component , so the reflection fraction , calculated as the ratio of incident to emitted flux at the disc surface , @xmath20 .",
    "the blackbody disc component is 0.4 times the power - law and if reflection is responsible for some of that emission then @xmath21 .",
    "a narrow emission line is introduced at 6.4  kev to account for ( weak ) distant reflection ( e.g. from the stellar companion ) and a narrow absorption feature is included at 1.85  kev to compensate for problems in the model response near the detector silicon edge .",
    "we show the model spectrum over the 265  kev band in the top panel of fig .",
    "the inner radius has been stepped from 1.3 to 1.9 , and then to @xmath22 and the innermost emissivity index @xmath23 .",
    "the effect of fixing @xmath4 at 3 is shown in the lower panel : the model is now less sensitive to the innermost radii .",
    ".values of key model parameters used in the spectral fitting . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ par.tab ]    a simple physical interpretation arises if the source of the steeper power - law is quasi - static and situated close to the centre of the disc , therefore producing the reflection .",
    "the harder component could originate from further out within the moving jet ; both soft source photons from the disc and reflection produced by the continuum are reduced by beaming ( beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "time lags then occur if variations propagate up the jet from the inner , quasistatic and softer component to the outer , jetted harder component .",
    "they need not propagate at jet speed , but could be due to changes in the magnetic structure or collimation of of the jet .",
    "the power in these components and the jet is presumed to derive from the accretion disc and be transferred by magnetic fields coupled to a range of radii , so varying in a manner which is consistent with the lyubarskii model .",
    "the lack of rapid reflection variations reported by revnivtsev et al 1999 ) could in part be due to light bending effects implicit in the proximity of the inner , softer , power - law component to the black hole ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) , if some of the rapid variability is due to ( small ) changes in height of that inner component .",
    "further development of such models is beyond the scope of this paper , which is focussed on the low state x - ray spectrum of cyg x-1 .",
    "we have used the x - ray reflection fitting method to obtain a robust measurement of the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole in cyg x-1 of @xmath16 .",
    "our result agrees with the continuum fitting value of gou et al ( 2011 ) and yields an even higher spin than the reflection measurement of duro et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "cygnus x-1 definitely appears to have high spin .",
    "we argue that non - newtonian values must be used for the inner emissivity profile of the reflected emission of the innermost disc when the spin is high ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the reflection fitting method relies on detection of the innermost radius of the disc which is dense enough for reflection to occur .",
    "we assume that this is the isco , for within that radius the plunge orbits mean that the gas density drops rapidly so the reflection signal vanishes .",
    "although magnetic fields may have some effect here , we consider it reasonable to assume that the dense parts of the disc that give the reflection spectrum are not seriously affected ( see discussion and simulations in reynolds & fabian 2008 and shafee et al 2008 ) .",
    "there is nevertheless a systematic uncertainty here which simulations need to resolve .     for the fit using the broken power - law is about 150 below that for the fit using a single power - law emissivity profile .",
    "the results in table 1 were obtained with the outer index free . ]",
    "the reflection fraction @xmath26 is low compared with the simple expectation of a source close to the black hole at @xmath27 .",
    "light bending should give @xmath28 ( e.g. fabian et al 2011 ) . the observed radio emission",
    "( miller et al 2012 ) means that a jet is operating , so it is plausible that the emission model is more complex , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "we suggest there that irradiation of the disc by the quasi - static base of the jet at a @xmath29 gravitational radii is responsible for the reflected emission , whereas the observed power - law continuum is dominated by higher , faster parts of the jet which mildly beam emission in our direction .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the models and ( relative ) spectral calibration can also affect the details of our fits and thus results , particularly of the innermost region .",
    "the continuum fitting method is also subject to systematic uncertainties in both models and spectral calibration ( relative and absolute ) .",
    "wide agreement on the high spin of cygnus x-1 boosts confidence in spin measurements from the reflection fitting method of other objects as well as agn , where it is the only method yet available .",
    "the spectral fits strongly indicate that the innermost radius of the disc lies within @xmath6 .",
    "relativistic effects are strong there and a simple newtonian assumption for the emissivity profile is inappropriate .",
    "the effects are inescapable and involve both special relativity , since the velocity of the reflecting matter on the disc is high , and general relativity , through gravitational redshift and light bending ( wilkins & fabian 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "theoretical emissivity profiles due to point sources at different heights on the rotation axis above the disc plane are shown in fig .",
    "12 of fabian et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "when the source height exceeds @xmath5 , the emissivity profile breaks at radius @xmath30 to the newtonian value of 3 outside and flatter within .",
    "the inner profile rapidly steepens to a high value within @xmath6 , if the disc extends in that far .",
    "we recommend that @xmath9 be used initially .",
    "should this lead to high spin being suspected then a power - law broken at least once , with a high inner index ( @xmath31 ) , should be used .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 where we have fitted our cyg x-1 data by a single power - law emissivity of free index .",
    "it shows the best fit being of high index and relatively low spin ( @xmath32 ) , which is rejected by the physical sense argument of duro et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "if instead we use a broken power - law emissivity fixing the outer index @xmath33 , then we find that the inner emissivity @xmath34 remains high and the spin rises to be very close to maximal ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this now makes physical sense .",
    "allowing the outer index to be free gives the results of table  1 .",
