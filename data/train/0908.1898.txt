    "investigations of thin film morphology evolution and control is of fundamental and technological interest .",
    "in particular , spontaneous self - organizing processes @xcite that lead to nanostructure formation in a reliable way have attracted tremendous attention .",
    "the resulting nanostructures can have novel behavior as well as be utilized in a wide variety of technologies , such as , energy harvesting @xcite , biomedicine@xcite , spintronics @xcite , photonics @xcite and magnetism @xcite .",
    "one example of a self - organizing process is the spontaneous dewetting of a continuous liquid film from a surface .",
    "a scientific understanding of dewetting has implications to many industrial applications , including in the deicing of airplane wings with non - wettable surfaces , in preventing hydroplaning of automobiles on wet roads due to thin continuous layer of water and in designing chemicals to prevent the break - up of the lachrymal film that protects the cornea of the eye .",
    "another growing application of dewetting is in the fabrication of nanoscale structures in a robust , controllable and cost - effective manner .",
    "the extensive studies of polymer thin films and growing number of investigations of dewetting in metallic thin films is indicative of this technological interest and also to the need for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the classical dewetting instability in thin films can be interpreted as a competition between two energy terms . for the case of",
    "a large number of polymer or metallic films studied , these two energies correspond to the surface tension and the attractive intermolecular dispersion force between the film - substrate and film - vacuum interfaces mediated by the film material .",
    "as shown first by vrij @xcite , the instability can be described from an energetic viewpoint by evaluating the thermodynamic free energy change of the system under perturbations to the film height .",
    "the prediction from such an energy analysis is that for certain perturbation wave vectors , the film enters an unstable state and thus , can spontaneously dewet . as a result , studies of dewetting have focused largely on the fluid dynamics of the film , through which it is possible to obtain the relationship between the rate of growth or decay of surface perturbations to their wave vector , i.e. the dispersion relation .",
    "however , the fluid dynamics for even the simplest dewetting scenario , such as the example above , is a highly nonlinear process , and , while addressable by many numerical techniques @xcite , is often evaluated through a linear analysis in order to achieve physical insights into dewetting .",
    "an alternate approach to quantitatively evaluate dewetting is thermodynamics .",
    "fluid flow pathways can be analyzed through thermodynamic considerations in which the conversion of useful internal energy to external energy loss via heat , such as by viscous dissipation , is used to quantify the behavior @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that such an approach can provide meaningful insight into the nature of fluid flow as well as the energy pathway for dewetting instabilities .",
    "specifically , we have applied the thermodynamic formulation to the case of dewetting in which film thickness dependent marangoni or thermocapillary forces are also present .",
    "such a situation has been observed in the melting of thin metallic films by nanosecond pulsed lasers @xcite . in our thermodynamic analysis the rate of thermodynamic free energy decrease due to film thickness fluctuations",
    "is balanced with the rate of energy loss due to viscous flow , i.e. viscous dissipation .",
    "this leads to a analytical description of the dewetting process without explicit need to solve the the height evolution dynamical equation from the navier - stokes ( ns ) equation .",
    "the thermodynamic and linear approach show identical results for classical dewetting . for thermocapillary dewetting",
    ", the two approaches agree only if the minimum viscous dissipation is evaluated .",
    "this minimum was found to occur for a particular flow boundary condition , which related the pressure gradient with the thermocapillary forces , and resulted in zero tangential stress at the film - substrate interface .",
    "besides this physical insight into the fluid flow , the thermodynamic analysis also showed that the dewetting pathway is one in which the rate of energy loss is minimized .",
    "for completeness , we first begin by summarizing the derivation of the thin film fluid velocity for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) incompressible fluid from the ns equation within the lubrication approximation . a complete analysis is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approximation",
    "the average or unperturbed thickness @xmath0 of the film is much smaller than the in - plane dimension ( x ) , as a result of which , the only velocity change of importance occurs along the thickness or z - direction .",
    "furthermore , because of the small thickness of the film , inertial effects can be neglected and so the flow is dominated by the viscous effects . using the above approximations , the ns equation for the steady - state condition ( @xmath1@xmath2 in the @xmath3-direction",
    "is given by:@xmath4    where @xmath5 is the @xmath3-component of the liquid velocity , @xmath6 is the pressure gradient in the direction of flow @xmath3 , and @xmath7 is the dynamic viscosity . by integrating the velocity @xmath5 as a function of height z we get:@xmath8 typical boundary conditions used to analyze the classical dewetting instability are the no - slip condition at the film - substrate , so @xmath9 , and a stress - free boundary condition at the top film surface .",
    "the no - slip condition results in @xmath10 . at the top surface",
    ", we introduce the h - dependent marangoni effect by equating the shear stress to the surface tension gradient : @xmath11 , where , @xmath12 is h - dependent surface tension of the film - vapor interface , @xmath13 is the magnitude of the height coefficient of surface tension , and @xmath14 is the thickness / height gradient along the flow direction , with all quantities evaluated at the average film thickness @xmath0 . from this , the velocity and velocity gradient in the @xmath15-direction can be respectively expressed as : @xmath16    and @xmath17 based on this , one can now easily evaluate the rate of energy loss due to viscous liquid flow , i.e. the viscous dissipation , per unit volume @xmath18 occurring in the film .",
    "this quantity is given by @xcite:@xmath19    for the case of classical dewetting , i.e. in which marangoni forces are absent ( @xmath20 ) , the viscous dissipation will be : @xmath21    where the superscript denotes classical .",
    "next , we can evaluate the rate of thermodynamic free energy change @xmath22 for fluctuations / perturbations to the initial height of the film . since we are primarily concerned with the dewetting instability",
    ", we will use the classical approach proposed by vrij where - in the film - vapor surface tension energy competes with the attractive dispersion energy .",
    "film height perturbations will increase the top film surface area and so surface tension increases the overall thermodynamic free energy of the film . on the other hand , the long range",
    "attractive dispersion energy varies as @xmath23 , where a is the hamaker coefficient with negative sign , leading to an overall decrease in thermodynamic free energy .",
    "as vrij showed , it is the free energy decrease resulting from competition between these two energy terms that drives the dewetting instability . here",
    ", we evaluate the rate of this free energy change by expressing the height perturbations as fourier components of type : @xmath24 where the perturbation has an amplitude of @xmath25 , a characteristic temporal decay rate @xmath26 and a corresponding wave vector @xmath27 . in this work",
    ", we explore the thermodynamic solution for a thermocapillary / marangoni problem where the surface tension is dependent on the local height but independent of the @xmath3-position on the surface .",
    "consequently , the surface tension change does not contribute to a change in free energy .",
    "this can be shown as follows .",
    "the standard procedure is to calculate the rate of total free energy change due to the height perturbation and evaluate it over one wavelength of the perturbation @xcite . in this case",
    ", the resulting rate of energy change will be    @xmath28    one can immediately see that when the magnitude of the surface tension derivative with respect to height ( @xmath29 ) is independent of the @xmath3-position along the film , the integral of the third term is @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , to calculate the rate of change in the free energy , we can ignore the contribution from @xmath31 , and express it as the difference due to the initial and perturbed film thickness at any position @xmath3 @xcite as :    @xmath32=\\sigma(\\gamma k^{2}+\\frac{a}{2\\pi h_{0}^{4}})\\epsilon^{2}e^{2\\left(\\sigma t - ikx\\right)}\\label{eq : dfoverdt}\\ ] ] the first term in the expression on the right hand side is the rate of increase of surface tension energy , and the second one is the rate of change in energy from the dispersive interaction .",
    "here we compare the characteristic dewetting length scales obtained from fluid dynamics versus the thermodynamic approach . the typical approach to obtain the dispersion relation between the rate @xmath26 and wave vector @xmath27 has been to describe the rate of change in film height based on the ns equation and mass conservation @xcite . for the classical dewetting instability , i.e. without marangoni effects ,",
    "the resulting dynamics is described by the equation @xcite :    @xmath33    as is evident , this equation is non - linear in @xmath34 and presents considerable challenges towards achieving an analytical description of dewetting that could provide simple but physically insightful information about the instability .",
    "consequently , a prevalent approach is a solution afforded by linear stability analysis .",

    "the thermodynamic ( th ) approach is based on equating the rate of free energy change ( eq . [ eq : dfoverdt ] ) to the total viscous dissipation in the film .",

    "as expected , the fluid dynamics described by lsa and the th approach give identical results for the classical dewetting instability @xcite .",
