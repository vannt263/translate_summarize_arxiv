    "this paper describes the development and testing of a prototype drift chamber whose purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of a `` cluster - counting '' technique@xcite for implementation in a high luminosity @xmath3 experiment .",
    "cluster counting is expected to improve particle identification ( pid ) by reducing the effect of fluctuations in drift chamber signals .",
    "these are due to gas amplification and the fluctuation in the number of primary electrons per ionization site .",
    "there may also be improvements in tracking resolution , but this is left for a later study .",
    "the requirement of fast electronics and larger data sizes may make the technique impractical in terms of capital costs , available space near the detector , and computing power",
    ". to date the technique has not been deployed in an operating experiment .",
    "this work demonstrates that a cluster - counting drift chamber is a feasible option for an experiment such as super-.1em__b__@xcite@xcite . super-.1em__b__.2emwas",
    "cancelled after the experiments described in this paper , but the results are applicable to any drift chamber that is used for particle identification .",
    "the design of our prototype chambers was strongly influenced by the demands of super-.1em__b__.2em , which are described in the technical design report@xcite .",
    "drift chambers are general - purpose detectors that can track and identify charged particles@xcite@xcite .",
    "they consist of a large volume of gas with instrumented wires held at different voltages . when charged particles move through the chamber they ionize the gas particles .",
    "the electrons from these primary ionizations drift towards the wires held at high positive voltage , while the ions drift towards the grounded wires .",
    "the sense wires are very thin ( @xmath4{\\mu m}$ ] ) , such that the strong electric field accelerates the electrons enough to cause further ionization near the sense wire .",
    "the new electrons ionize further into an avalanche , which is registered as an electronic signal on the sense wire .",
    "the amplification of the low - integer number of primary ionization electrons into a detectable signal on the wire is called the gas gain .",
    "the energy loss of a heavy ( @xmath5{mev / c^2}$ ] ) charged particle from primary ionizations depends on its speed , as given by the bethe formula@xcite and various corrections@xcite .",
    "the speed measurement is combined with the independent momentum measurement from tracking , giving the particle s mass , which is a unique identifier . to measure speed , we measure or estimate a quantity proportional to the number of primary ionizations .",
    "a traditional drift chamber accomplishes this by measuring the total ionization per unit length of the track , which is proportional to the integral of the electronic signal on the sense wires belonging to a track .",
    "the theoretical probability distribution function for the total ionization is a landau distribution , which has an infinite mean and standard deviation@xcite .",
    "the consequence is that if one takes the average of a number of samples ( e.g.  40 measurements of deposited charge in a track ) , the resulting distribution is non - gaussian and is dependent on the number of samples taken . instead of the mean of the distribution",
    ", one can use the most probable value for the total ionization .",
    "this is accessed by a truncated mean technique .",
    "our truncated mean procedure is described in sec .",
    "[ bootstrapping ] .",
    "the conventional technique described above is sensitive to gas gain fluctuations as well as the statistical fluctuations in the number of primary electrons produced in each ionization event .",
    "moreover , the truncated mean procedure that is typically used discards a substantial fraction of the available information .",
    "none of these disadvantages exist if the number of primary ionizations can be measured more directly .",
    "the cluster - counting technique involves resolving the cluster of avalanching electrons from each primary ionization event .",
    "this is done by digitizing the signal from the sense wire in each cell and applying a suitable algorithm .",
    "the rise time of the signal from a cluster is approximately @xmath6{ns}$ ] , so electronics with sufficiently high bandwidth are required .    in principle , clusters can be detected as long as they do not overlap completely in time .",
    "this can happen irrespective of the electronics involved due to the probabilistic nature of the ionization process .",
    "overlapping clusters are more likely for highly oblique tracks .",
    "complex algorithms which consider signal pulse heights might disentangle even overlapping clusters , but the algorithms tested in this work do not .",
    "an optimal algorithm would have a high efficiency for identifying true clusters and a low rate of reporting false clusters ( due to noise for example ) .      in traditional drift chambers using the integrated signal ,",
    "the signal amplitude is determined by the convolution of the probability of primary ionization , the number of primary electrons produced , and the variations in gas gain .",
    "this results in a long - tailed distribution that is typically dealt with by the truncated mean procedure .",
    "conversely , if clusters are perfectly identified , then the only variation is from the primary ionization , which is a poisson process .",
    "no cluster counts need to be discarded to allow for a proper statistical treatment . in reality",
    "some counted clusters will be missing or fake , the rate of these being caused by gas gain fluctuations , noise level , and the time separation capabilities of the electronics .",
    "the idea is that the sensitivity to these effects is small .",
    "the difficulty arises from the need to optimize an arbitrarily complex cluster - counting algorithm .",
    "a difficulty with both charge integration and cluster counting is the presence of @xmath7-rays@xcite . these are electrons produced in primary ionizations that travel far in the gas before further ionizing , such that they create their own separate ionization cluster .",
    "the production of @xmath7-rays at a given momentum depends only on the particle speed ( @xmath8)@xcite . this inflates the charge integral and the cluster count with only a weak dependence on the species of the original particle , the result is a decreased pid resolution in general .",
    "the presence of @xmath7-rays is one of the reasons why a truncated mean is used in the charge integration method .",
    "while cluster counting is also affected by @xmath7-rays , the effect is less pronounced , allowing all of the data to be used .",
    "any cluster - counting algorithm that uses a digitized signal is able to report not only the number of clusters in a cell , but also the arrival time of each of those clusters . in the oversimplified case of a linear and homogenous drift velocity and infinite cells ,",
    "the average spacing in time between consecutive clusters would simply be proportional to the inverse of the number of clusters in the cell . in a more realistic scenario ,",
    "the average spacing between clusters is useful information that is not one - to - one with the number of clusters .",
    "we can exploit the lack of perfect correlation and use the cluster timing information to further improve our ability to identify particles .      for tracking ,",
    "cluster counting may also improve performance , but in a much lesser degree and more subtle manner than as for pid .",
    "a traditional drift chamber uses only the arrival time of the overall signal in determining the distance of closest approach from a sense wire .",
    "unfortunately this arrival time measurement is vulnerable to noise , gas gain fluctuations ( small initial clusters may be missed ) , etc .",
    "if the first few clusters are resolved , then while the first cluster arrival time is still the primary datum , the second cluster arrival time can be used as a consistency check .",
    "if the second cluster arrives much too late , then the chance that the first cluster was a fake is greater , so a smaller statistical weight can be assigned to that cell when reconstructing the whole track .",
    "this paper deals only with the pid improvements and does not address tracking .",
    "in this section we describe the prototype drift chambers that were built , the custom signal amplifiers and the various types of cables that were tested .",
    "we also describe the experimental setup in the test beam , the data acquisition system , and the devices used for external pid and triggering .",
    "we built two nearly identical full - length ( @xmath9{m}$ ] ) single - cell drift chambers , called chamber @xmath10 and chamber @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ m11_photo ] ) .",
    "the only difference between the two chambers is the diameter of the sense wires : @xmath12{\\mu m}$ ] for chamber @xmath10 and @xmath13 or @xmath14{\\mu m}$ ] for chamber @xmath11 .",

    "the gas chosen for the test was a mixture of helium and isobutane in a @xmath20 volume ratio .",
    "helium was chosen because it reduces the effect of multiple scattering compared to the more typical argon@xcite .",
    "multiple scattering of the charged particles is the dominant contribution to the tracking resolution at a b - factory like super-.1em__b__. in consideration of the rest of the super-.1em__b__.2emdetector , using helium reduces the number of radiation lengths represented by the drift chamber . with isobutane as the quench gas , we are able to operate the chamber with a large helium fraction , further reducing the amount of material .",
    "helium also exhibits a lower drift velocity and ionization density , which also makes it an ideal choice for cluster counting as the incoming clusters will be less likely to overlap in the digitized signal .",
    "the chambers are operated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure .",
    "we measured the temperature and pressure during the data taking periods , we did not use these at any level of the analysis .",
    "we used custom made amplifiers in order to achieve the bandwidth required for cluster counting .",

    "the correct voltage settings for the guard wires in the cell were determined using the computer program garfield@xcite .",
    "the guard wire voltages are chosen to make the sensitive region of our cell behave as if it were part of an infinite array of identical cells .",
    "these voltages scale linearly with the chosen sense wire voltage .",
    "the sense wire voltage for a given chamber and amplifier was tuned to obtain roughly equal - amplitude pulses in the final signal .",
    "this was done empirically by looking at the fraction of events on the oscilloscope ( sec .",

    "for some of the runs we varied the type of signal cable used to connect the output of the amplifiers to the data acquisition system .",
    "we used two different types of sub - miniature rg-59/u cables ( models 1855a and 179dt from belden ) and miniature coax ( model 1282 from belden ) , all with @xmath29{\\omega}$ ] impedance .",
    "the lengths were all @xmath30{m}$ ] , which is the distance between the amplifiers and digitizers for super-.1em__b__. from the signal - propagation perspective , the 1855a is a better cable than the 179dt , having less signal attenuation ( @xmath31{db/100m}$ ] versus @xmath32{db/100m}$ ] at @xmath33{ghz}$ ] ) .",
    "from the perspective of mechanical integration with the rest of the detector however , the 179dt cable would be preferable to the 1855a , being lighter , thinner , and allowing a smaller minimum bend radius ( @xmath34{mm}$ ] versus @xmath35{mm}$ ] ) .",

    "the beam s momentum spread is small enough that a histogram of the tof shows distinct peaks corresponding to the species of the particles in the beam .",
    "the tof system consists of two counters @xmath41{m}$ ] apart , one upstream of the prototypes and one downstream ( fig .  [ beam_test_schematic ] ) .",

    "the tof signals are also used as part of the trigger system for the oscilloscope .",
    "it was noted that with only the upstream and downstream counters , many events contained no signals in the drift chambers ( i.e.  oscilloscope traces with just normal noise , no clusters ) . in addition , the tof histogram showed six peaks , though only three were expected .",
    "the six peaks appeared to be in two similar groups , shifted in tof value .",
    "the conjectured origin of the higher - tof valued population was beam particles passing through the upstream counter but angled downwards , scattering off of the metal table , then passing through the downstream counter , bypassing the chambers entirely and taking a longer path .",

    "cluster - counting algorithms can vary in complexity , efficiency , and in their rate of reporting fake clusters . here",
    "we briefly describe the various algorithms , but precise definitions can be found in appendix [ cc_appendix ] .",
    "the algorithms involve two forms of smoothing of the oscilloscope traces ( fig .  [",
    "fig : smoothings ] ) .",
    "the first is a `` boxcar smoothing '' where each sample is replaced with the average of itself and the @xmath59 previous samples .",
    "the second is a true averaging procedure , where the number of points in a trace is reduced and each point is the average of @xmath60 points .",
    "all of the algorithms involve some kind of transformation of the smoothed signal , and a threshold - crossing criterion .",
    "the transformed signals for the various algorithms are shown in fig .",
    "[ cc_cut_quantities ] .",
    "one of the most basic cluster - counting algorithms is the `` threshold above average '' .",
    "it subtracts the non - smoothed signal at time @xmath61 from the boxcar - smoothed signal at time @xmath62 , then applies a threshold .",
    "a more general algorithm ( of which the previous is a special case ) is the `` smooth and delay '' algorithm .",
    "it involves smoothing two copies of the signal by different amounts , delaying one of the copies by a certain number of frames , then taking the difference and applying a threshold .",
    "this algorithm has four parameters , and is thus more difficult to optimize .",
    "the two algorithms above essentially implement a first - derivative method .",
    "we also implemented a second - derivative method .",
    "this one uses the true averaging procedure rather than the `` boxcar smoothing '' .",
    "the first derivative is first calculated by taking the difference between consecutive smoothed samples .",
    "the second derivative is then calculated by taking the difference between consecutive first derivative values .",
    "each time , we divide by the time interval represented by a sample , to keep the units consistent . the number of clusters counted using the second derivative is shown for each particle species in fig .  [ cellclustersperspecies ] .",
    "all of the threshold algorithms in principle trigger on the leading edge of cluster signals .",
    "however it is noticeable that real cluster pulses have a very sharp leading edge ( approximately @xmath45{ns}$ ] ) and a slower decaying trailing edge ( approximately @xmath63{ns}$ ] ) .",
    "fake clusters are more symmetric , returning to the baseline voltage faster than the signal from a real cluster . thus an algorithm was devised that takes cluster candidates from the above algorithms , but requires the pulse to last a minimum duration in order to be confirmed .",
    "pulses that return to baseline too quickly are discarded as fake clusters .",
    "this `` timeout booster '' allows the use of smaller thresholds , which while increasing the efficiency of finding real clusters also admit more fakes .",
    "the timeout criterion removes most of the fakes but keeps the real clusters .    as mentioned before ,",
    "each of the cluster - counting algorithms can return not only the number of clusters , but the actual time at which each cluster was found .",
    "we investigated the use of this information , in the form of an average time separation between clusters in each cell .",
    "the prototypes have only a single cell .",
    "the traditional method of identifying particles using the truncated mean requires many cells forming a track .",
    "thus we construct tracks from the single - cell events .    to compose a track for a given species of particle , we select ( with replacement ) random single - cell events that have been identified with the time - of - flight information .",
    "we positively identify particles with tof values within 3 standard deviations of the central values of the three gaussian peaks corresponding to the particle species . for a typical run with e.g.  3500 single muon events",
    ", the number of possible muon tracks is astronomical ( @xmath64 ) , and the likelihood of a given track being composed of multiple copies of the same single - cell event is low ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we also form empty tracks by combining the signals from asynchronous events .",
    "the information from each event is combined to form the track information .",
    "the track information is the particle species , total number of clusters found per of track , and the truncated mean of the charge integrals from each cell .",
    "the truncated mean is performed by sorting the list of charge integrals and taking @xmath32{\\%}$ ] of the values starting from the beginning of the list .",
    "the value of @xmath32{\\%}$ ] was roughly optimized to give better separation , for comparison @xmath66{\\%}$ ] was used in babar@xcite .",
    "the super-.1em__b__.2emdrift chamber design has 40 layers .",
    "thus we use 40 events from our single - cell prototypes events to create a composed track .",
    "the @xmath32{\\%}$ ] truncated mean was thus done by rejecting the largest 12 integrated charge values from the cells .    in the case of tracks formed from asynchronous events ,",
    "the list is not sorted , since these values are already gaussian , but still the same fraction of values is discarded .",
    "the distribution of truncated mean charge and clusters for the composed tracks is shown in figs .",
    "[ trackchargeperspecies ] and [ trackclustersperspecies ] , respectively .",
    "we also form the track - wise average time separation between clusters by doing a weighed average of the cell - wise average cluster separation for the events in the track .",
    "the weights are the number of clusters in the cells .",
    "it is worth noting that the relative separations of the muon and pion peaks shown in figs .",
    "[ trackchargeperspecies ] and [ trackclustersperspecies ] are very different . for the truncated mean of the integrated charges ,",
    "the relative separation between the peaks ( difference in the location of the peaks , divided by the average of the two ) is @xmath67{\\%}$ ] , while for the cluster counting it is @xmath1{\\%}$ ] .",
    "navely this should mean that the cluster counting technique is less effective .",
    "however because the widths of these peaks is also very different , the two techniques turn out to be of comparable power ( fig .",
    "[ r_and_dedx ] ) .      in order to combine the information from the truncated mean and the cluster count , we form likelihoods based on fits to the two quantities .",
    "these quantities are reasonably gaussian ( for non - empty tracks ) , so we fit them with gaussian distributions @xmath68 , for particle species @xmath69 and measured quantity @xmath70 . for a given track ,",
    "the likelihood of the track coming from a particle @xmath69 is found by evaluating the product of the fitted distribution functions for both @xmath70s at the measured values .",
    "thus if the measured truncated mean charge for a track is @xmath71 and the clusters per @xmath72 of track are @xmath60 , the combined likelihood is    @xmath73    this combined likelihood ignores any correlation between the two quantities .",
    "the correlation is indeed non - zero but is somewhat weak ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "possibly combined likelihood models which make use of the correlation would be more effective , but we did not investigate this .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ beam ] , the ability to identify muons and pions at @xmath0{mev / c}$ ] is our proxy variable for the performance of the prototypes .",
    "thus we form a ratio of the combined likelihoods of being a muon and pion :    @xmath75    this quantity s distribution is peaked at 0 for real pions and at 1 for real muons .",
    "a cut can be made that maximizes the separation according to some figure of merit . a typical way to demonstrate",
    "the performance is by making a rejection - selection efficiency plot .",
    "consider the fraction of real pions that would also be identified as pions by the cut on @xmath76 , and the fraction of real muons that would not be identified ( that is , rejected ) as pions by the cut on @xmath76 .",
    "we can thus make a parametric plot of muon rejection efficiency on the vertical axis and pion selection efficiency on the horizontal axis , with the parameter being the chosen @xmath76 cut value ( fig .  [ r_and_dedx ] ) .",
    "similar efficiency graphs can be made for cuts directly on the physical quantities of charge and cluster counts .",
    "the efficiency graphs are a good way to represent the performance of a particular setup , but they are two - dimensional and difficult to include in summaries .",
    "thus we construct figures of merit in order to quantify the performance of an equipment choice or algorithm .",
    "a convenient method is to set a given background rejection level and state the corresponding signal efficiency . in the muon rejection and pion selection plot",
    ", one may thus find the muon rejection efficiency corresponding to @xmath77{\\%}$ ] pion selection efficiency , or vice - versa .",
    "these figures of merit are easy to interpret physically and correspond to how detector performance is typically quantified in past experiments .",
    "an alternative figure of merit turns out to better differentiate between algorithm parameter choices , but has a much less intuitive physical meaning .",
    "it is the maximum excursion on the muon rejection and pion efficiency plot from the origin of the graph .",
    "the curves on the graph approach @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the limits of @xmath76 cut values of 0 and 1 respectively , but the curves can lie above that inscribed by a circle of unit radius . the length of the longest straight line joining @xmath80 and the efficiency curve",
    "is taken as the figure of merit . in certain cases",
    "the performance is bad enough that the lines lie below that inscribed by a circle , in this case the alternative figure of merit is not meaningful , as it is identically 1 .",
    "all three figures of merit can be shown to be equivalent , in the sense that local maxima and minima lie in the same regions of parameter space .",
    "the maximum - excursion - from - origin figure gives better separation for those runs where it is meaningful ( the majority ) .",
    "it is used for the optimization of algorithms , but the results are presented using the more intuitive figure of merit of pion selection efficiency at @xmath77{\\%}$ ] muon rejection .",
    "in this section we present the results of varying the cluster - counting algorithms , gas gain , various chamber positions , and other equipment choices .",
    "the time over which to integrate a signal in order to capture the charge deposition on the wire was determined empirically . in principle",
    "the optimal value varies from run to run depending on gas gain , dip angle of the beam , and window position , but we wish to compare runs at different settings .",
    "thus we look at the figure of merit for many different runs and choose a suitable compromise ( fig .",
    "[ itimevariation ] ) .",
    "as it turns out , the performance does not vary strongly as a function of integration time once the time is suitably long .",
    "we choose an integration time of @xmath81{ns}$ ] for the rest of the study .",
    "the various cluster - counting algorithms have parameters that must be tuned empirically . by iterating this procedure many times using the same run ,",
    "a `` map '' of the figure of merit can be created in the algorithm parameter space , the maxima of which are optimal values for the algorithms ( fig .  [ cc3_optimization ] ) . while the figure of merit includes the pid performance from @xmath82 and cluster counting , the @xmath82 contribution is essentially constant even with the randomness introduced by the track composition process .",
    "the optimal parameters vary from algorithm to algorithm and depend on the run used to optimize the parameters . in an operational experiment , only one set of parameters can be chosen , so some compromise will be necessary .",
    "nevertheless , to compare the algorithms themselves , we may compare the performance of each algorithm when optimized on the same data run .",
    "the chosen run has the following parameters : @xmath83 degree dip angle , window @xmath84{mm}$ ] from the amplifier , and @xmath12{\\mu m}$ ] sense wire .",
    "a @xmath23{\\omega}$ ] inverting amplifier and 1855a sub - miniature rg59/u signal cable with no extra connector are used .",

    "a total of 30784 triggers were recorded of which 7720 are asynchronous , and 680 , 3649 , and 13579 are positively identified as positrons , muons , and pions respectively .",
    "the remainder have tof values more than @xmath45{\\sigma}$ ] away from the peaks or have no signal in the chamber .",
    "the dip angle of 10 degrees was chosen rather than 0 in order to avoid space charge effects .",
    "the avalanches produced on the wire from the passage of a particle at zero degrees occur all in the same gas volume near the wire .",

    "we explored a variety of algorithms , which are described in detail in appendix [ cc_appendix ] .",

    "for example the temperature of the gas in the chamber plays no role in our calculations , though the temperature did change during the data taking period .",
    "the track composition process involves drawing random numbers , so a contribution to the uncertainty from this can be estimated by composing multiple sets of tracks and seeing the distribution of results .",

    "we also tried applying the technique to the other algorithms , but it was noticed that if the algorithm already has reasonable performance , the improvement from the timeout is negligible . indeed the optimal timeout duration for the `` smooth and delay '' algorithm is zero , yielding the same performance as the bare algorithm .",
    "overall the best algorithm is the two - pass second derivative algorithm , but it is only marginally better than the other algorithms . the difference is less than the typical variation due to the track composition process .",
    "it is fortuitous that even the simple algorithms have good performance , as they are reasonable to implement using a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) or even analog hardware .    in some sections that follow ,",
    "the pid performance with optimized cluster counting refers to the use of a cluster - counting algorithm where the parameters were chosen to give the best figure of merit for that run .",

    "in addition , if we form a tripartite combined likelihood , the improvement relative to the bipartite charge integration and cluster counting combination is negligible .",
    "given the increased computational complexity of calculating the average separations , it is unlikely that the timing information will be useful for pid purposes in a real particle physics experiment .",
    "the gas gain of the prototypes depends on the choice of sense wire voltage and on the gas .",

    "the dependence of gas gain on sense wire voltage is approximately exponential@xcite . in our case",
    "a @xmath95{v}$ ] change corresponds to a doubling or halving of the gas gain .",
    "the resulting performance after doubling and halving the gain is shown in fig .",
    "[ gainvariation ] .",
    "previous to the experiment , the intuitive notion was that higher gas gains would be better , since the signals would stand out more from the random noise on the chamber wires .",
    "it appears however that this is not the case and that indeed better pid performance can be obtained at lower gas gains .",
    "lower performance at higher gas gains is either due to gas effects ( e.g.  space charge ) or to the amplifiers .",
    "we did not explore the even lower gains where the performance is expected to decrease again .",
    "data runs using other amplifiers with different gain do show the eventual decrease ( sec .",

    "[ gainvariation ] ( within @xmath2{v}$ ] ) .    when choosing a gas gain for an experiment the most important features are more often the tracking performance , ageing issues , and operational issues .",
    "this is more likely to influence the choice of specific gain , regardless of the pid performance .",
    "however , if pid performance is also highly valued , lower gains should be explored .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ momentumvariation ] , the difference of ionization between pions and muons is greater at lower momenta .",
    "this is in agreement with theoretical expectations and simulations .",
    "as expected , the improvement from adding cluster counting is most noticeable at the momentum where the overall performance is worst , making the detector response more uniform .",
    "the prototypes have five windows at five thin aluminium positions along their @xmath9{m}$ ] length .",
    "the reference point is chosen to be the amplifiers , so the high - voltage connectors at the other end of the chamber are at @xmath96{mm}$ ] .",
    "the centres of the five windows are @xmath97 and @xmath98{mm}$ ] from the amplifiers .",
    "most tests were performed at the windows @xmath99 and @xmath84{mm}$ ] from the amplifiers , but a sequence of runs was taken to determine the effect of the signal propagating along the sense wire .",
    "the sense wire voltages were chosen as described in sec .",
    "[ wire_voltages ] at the middle position , but left unaltered for the other windows in the sequence .",
    "thus the oscilloscope and amplifier saturations may change as a function of beam position .",
    "the tungsten wire is very thin and has a non - negligible dc resistance ( @xmath100{\\omega}$ ] for the @xmath12{\\mu m}$ ] diameter wire ) , so it was expected that the performance would be better at the windows closer to the amplifiers .",

    "if the resulting quantity crosses the threshold @xmath118 downwards , a cluster is identified at that time .",
    "two copies of the original signal are smoothed by different amounts ( @xmath121 and @xmath71 frames ) using the `` boxcar smoothing '' .",
    "the @xmath71-frame smoothed copy is then delayed by @xmath122 frames , and the two copies are then subtracted .",
    "if the resulting quantity crosses the threshold @xmath118 downwards , a cluster is counted at that time .",
    "the cluster times found by this algorithm are those @xmath61 in @xmath123 that satisfy @xmath124 the `` signal above average '' algorithm is a special case with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "another special case can be constructed with @xmath128 with the denominator set to @xmath129 .",
    "it can be shown that if the two smoothing times are equal ( @xmath130 ) , the quantity computed with smoothing @xmath71 and delay @xmath122 is identical to that computed with smoothing @xmath122 and delay @xmath71 .",
    "thus the parameter range can be restricted to @xmath131 without loss of generality .",
    "this algorithm has two parameters : a smoothing time and a threshold .",
    "it uses the true averaging procedure rather than the `` boxcar smoothing '' , so the time is labelled @xmath113 as in sec .",
    "[ averagingsection ] .",
    "simply put , the second derivative is calculated and compared with a threshold .    the second derivative is calculated as follows : @xmath132 - [ \\bar{v}(\\bar{t}+1 ) - \\bar{v}(\\bar{t})]\\bigr)\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the time interval corresponding to the @xmath60 samples that were averaged to do the smoothing .",
    "because this algorithm uses the true averaging , it suffers from the problem of potentially `` dividing '' cluster signals between smoothing bins ( fig .",
    "[ cc_cut_quantities ] ) .",
    "thus we also implemented a two - pass second - derivative algorithm that looks for clusters a second time on the averaged signal with a delay applied as described in sec .",
    "[ averagingsection ] .",
    "the numbers of clusters found in each pass are added together .",
    "it is understood that the resulting cluster count is inflated because many clusters will be double - counted , but nevertheless it is an appropriate variable for identifying particles .        for a given cluster candidate ,",
    "the voltage and time in the original waveform at which the cluster - finding algorithm was triggered is recorded .",
    "then following the waveform forward , the voltage is checked to see when it has recovered above the recorded value ( the pulses are negative ) . if the voltage recovered within the timeout window , it is a short - lived pulse and thus rejected as a fake . if the timeout is reached without the voltage recovering , it is long - lived and kept as a real cluster .    for a list of potential clusters @xmath135 , real clusters satisfy @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the chosen timeout .",
    "the rejection of fake clusters by the timeout procedure permits the use of lower thresholds in the original algorithm .",
    "the lower threshold increases the efficiency of finding real clusters ( smaller miss rate ) but increases the rate of detecting fake clusters .",
    "the timeout procedure then eliminates most of the fake clusters , keeping the real ones .",
