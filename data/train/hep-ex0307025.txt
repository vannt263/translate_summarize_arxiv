    "the new data taking started march 2001 , marked a new era for the @xmath0 physics at the tevatron collider .",
    "both experiments , cdf and d0 , have new strategies to select @xmath0 events among the huge @xmath1 production using triggers based on the track impact parameter .",
    "fully hadronic decays like @xmath2 , considered fundamental to measure the mixing frequency , can be selected requiring at least two tracks displaced from the primary vertex .",
    "+ the combination of one displaced track and a lepton ( muon or electron ) allows to lower the threshold on the lepton trigger with respect to the run i data taking , increasing the number of reconstructed events in the semileptonic sample .",
    "but also the `` old '' dilepton trigger has been improved thanks to the new tracking systems and the upgraded electronics increasing the number of events with a @xmath3 particle in the final state . besides the mixing frequency many other measurements can be done in the @xmath0 system to test the standard model and to go beyond it . here",
    "the mixing , the lifetime , the lifetime differences and the mass are discussed .",
    "the precise @xmath0 mass determination is one of the measurements that both cdf and d0 can perform to test qcd . in this analysis",
    "the @xmath0 is reconstructed through the decay @xmath4 with the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 .",
    "starting from the dataset of @xmath7 47 pb@xmath8 collected with the dimuons trigger d0 has reconstructed a sample of @xmath9 events , shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath11 events ( see fig .  [",

    "is expected  @xcite of the same order as the @xmath14 lifetime and with the current data @xmath0 and @xmath15 lifetimes are consistent within @xmath16 4% accuracy .",
    "the @xmath0 measurements are dominated by statistical errors and the tevatron experiments are expected to improve them in a near future .",
    "+ cdf can perform this measurement using two different samples : the semileptonic decays and the fully reconstructed hadronic decays .",
    "the former has already been used at cdf in run i  @xcite and based on this analysis cdf predicts that in 2 fb@xmath8 cdf can reach a 2@xmath17 precision on the lifetimes .",
    "[ fig : lifebs ] displays the invariant mass when a @xmath18 is reconstructed close to a muon(left ) and an electron(right ) and the charges of @xmath19 and lepton match the requirement of the decay .",
    "the lifetime measurement is in progress . at the moment cdf",
    "has already @xmath7 5 times the statistics of run i with the signal to noise ratio even better than expected .",
    "this has been achieved thanks to the trigger on the impact parameter since these candidates are reconstructed on the lepton plus displaced track sample .",
    "to    the run ii predictions for the lifetime measured with fully hadronic decays are based on the monte carlo simulation as described in  @xcite .",
    "the statistics is expected to be larger than the semileptonic sample and with the proper time resolution of about 45 fs an error of @xmath20 with 2fb@xmath8 of data is within the cdf reach .",
    "the @xmath4 has two components : one with cp even ( dominant ) with a short lifetime and one at cp odd with a long lifetime .",
    "these events will be used to measure the lifetime difference , @xmath21 , between the two eigenstates , the even and the odd .",
    "the best accuracy will obtained when the short component measured in this decay and the average lifetime obtained from the @xmath2 are combined . by using the result obtained in run",
    "i  @xcite cdf evaluated its reach with 2fb@xmath8 of data : @xmath22 .",
    "+ at the moment the statistics is limited and cdf presents a measurement of the lifetime without separating the two components : @xmath23 .",
    "this process is considered a `` gold - plated '' @xmath0 decay because it is also sensitive to new physics beyond standard model . within this model",
    "the cp asymmetry is expected to be very small and an observation of a deviation can only be attributed to sources of new physics .",
    "the mixing frequency in the @xmath0 system is one of most important measurement to verify the standard model .",
    "the current limit is @xmath24 ps@xmath8 which translates in @xmath25 .",
    "comparing this number to the @xmath15 oscillation frequency @xmath26 ps@xmath8 gives an idea of how difficult will be to measure these fast oscillations .",
    "+ the sensitivity on @xmath27 can be expressed : @xmath28 where n is the total number of events before the flavor tagging , @xmath29 is the tagging efficiency , @xmath30 the dilution , @xmath31 the proper time resolution and @xmath32 the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the above formula drives the analysis : a sample of events with a reasonable signal - to - noise is needed , but also a good resolution in reconstructing the decay time is necessary as well as an efficient flavor tagging algorithm .",

    "ii the statistics and the signal to noise ratio will be improved as already discussed in  [ sec : life ] but the cdf sensitivity for @xmath27 in this decay channel remains limited due to the fact that @xmath0 is partially reconstructed .",
    "the proper time @xmath34 is given by the decay length divided by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the correction factor for the missing neutrino .",
    "this correction , calculated using the monte carlo , introduces an additional resolution factor , @xmath37fs @xmath38 with @xmath39 .    to    the cdf predictions , shown in fig .",

    "a very detailed monte carlo detector simulation has been developed and tuned on data to reproduce the different data taking configurations cdf had : the silicon coverage now is almost 100@xmath17 but in two years varied a lot due to tevatron incidents and subsequent recovering .",
