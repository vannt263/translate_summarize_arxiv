    "stability of a disk can be quantified in terms of the toomre parameter @xcite @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the sound - speed of the gas , @xmath58 is the epicyclic frequency , which is typically of the same order of magnitude as @xmath59 , the rotational frequency of the disk , and @xmath60 is the surface density of the disk .",
    "a pure gas disk is gravitationally unstable wherever @xmath61 .",
    "the analysis for a disk that contains both gas and stars is more complex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite also find that the disk is highly stable at @xmath64 , due to its low surface density , and although metallicity dependent variations in the co - to - h@xmath33 conversion factor could lead to this being underestimated @xcite , it is unlikely to make enough of a difference to render the disk unstable",
    ".    it is therefore plausible that on the largest scales , gravitational instability helps to gather together the gas required for gmc formation .",
    "however , gmcs probably do not form directly from this instability : the growth time scale is long @xcite , and the applicability of the toomre analysis , which assumes an infinitely thin disk , to scales smaller than the disk scale height is also questionable .",
    "it is far more plausible that gravitational instability promotes gmc formation indirectly , by enhancing non - axisymmetric features such as spiral arms that help to gather the diffuse gas together ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "both mechanisms can induce the converging flows that constitute the last stage of compression necessary to form gmcs .",

    "the 21  cm surveys of @xcite reveal hundreds of hi  supershells in the galaxy surrounding ob associations @xcite .",
    "these 0.1 to 1  kpc scale features surround bubbles of hot plasma traced by extremely low density hii  regions and x - ray emission .",
    "they appear to be powered by the combined impact of photoionization , stellar winds , and supernova explosions .",
    "@xcite proposed that gravitational instabilities in the supershells swept - up by expanding superbubbles would first occur on the mass - scale of gmcs in the solar vicinity .",
    "as superbubbles sweep - up the surrounding ism , the resulting shell expansion velocities decrease .",
    "once the local velocity dispersion of a given patch of the shell drops below the gravitational escape velocity , that region becomes subject to gravitational instability . both small and large length- and mass - scales are stable , giving rise to a critical intermediate scale , which in the solar vicinity is similar to the observed scales of gmcs .",
    "regardless of whether it is ultimately gravity or stellar feedback that is more important for assembling diffuse gas into dense clouds , the behavior of the gas on small scales is likely to be rather similar .",
    "because gmc formation requires large amounts of gas to be gathered into one place , gmcs will typically form at the stagnation points of converging flows of gas , and the details of their formation will have little dependence on how these flows are driven .",

    "the earliest one - dimensional models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thermal instability can create dense structures directly via the isobaric form of the instability . however , most of the resulting small clumps are not self - gravitating @xcite , and instead it is the ensemble of clumps produced by a coherent converging flow that might become unstable @xcite",
    ". an important feature of the clouds formed in colliding flows is that they typically undergo global gravitational collapse primarily in the directions perpendicular to the flow ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such collapse naturally leads to the formation of filaments .",
    "the non - linear development of the thermal instability also proceeds by forming a network of filaments ( see  [ filaments ] ) , at whose intersections clumps ( see  [ par_clumps ] ) are subsequently formed @xcite .",

    "more rigorous detection and quantitative assessment of filaments is now underway using a variety of tools based on a variety of morphological analyses of multi - scale diffuse emission .",

    "again , these column densities are lower than those cited by @xcite for two possible reasons : beam dilution caused by the greater distances to these filaments ( 500  pc  3.5  kpc ) and the fact that @xcite use the average column density rather than the column density at the spine of the filaments",
    ". this latter effect tends to decrease the quoted column density by a factor of four .",

    "because stars generally form in the densest parts of clouds , this momentum transfer contributes to gas dispersal .",
    "the effectiveness of this form of feedback depends on both how much radiation is produced by the stars and what fraction of this radiation is trapped by the cloud @xcite .",
    "radiation can leak out through cavities in highly structured clouds , lowering its effectiveness as a feedback mechanism ; this is the case for most galactic gmcs . during their accretion phase ,",
    "all stars produce powerful mhd - powered bipolar outflows whose momentum injection rate is 10 to 100 times @xmath183 . when massive stars form , their outflows are likely to clear channels through which radiation can leak out of the parent clump , decreasing the feedback from radiation pressure . models of the effects of radiation pressure on star - forming clouds show that in low - mass clouds radiative trapping is small and that photoionization is more important than radiation pressure for destroying clouds @xcite .",
    "radiative trapping could be larger in more massive clouds , although @xcite argue that rayleigh - taylor instability of pressure - driven gas dramatically reduces its effective optical depth ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "feedback from outflows , fuv , ionizing radiation , and radiation pressure produce comparable momentum injection rates . in turn , these are similar to momentum dissipation rates for typical parameters .",
    "this points to a dynamic balance between dissipation and injection .",
    "furthermore , the low sfe in typical gmcs suggests that once the sfe reaches 220% , feedback wins and disrupts the cloud .",
    "failure of feedback could lead to high sfe and formation of bound clusters @xcite .",
    "ob stars that eventually explode as type ii supernovae have lifetimes of 330  my , longer than gmc lifetimes .",
    "stellar winds , radiation pressure , and the supernovae generated have powerful feedback on clouds , even those at dozens or hundreds of pc from the explosion site as observations of the local superbubbles show .",
    "supernovae probably play the dominant role in driving turbulence on large scales in the ism @xcite .",
    "an assessment of the available estimates of the present day sfr in the milky way was carried out by @xcite using a common imf and stellar models applied to measured free - free emission rates and mid - ir yso counts .",

    "the glimpse and mipsgal surveys @xcite result in a modeled sfr @xmath185  m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  @xcite ; the main uncertainty arises from contamination by agb stars . using the classic method of measuring the lyman continuum luminosity from hii regions free - free radio continuum @xcite use the wmap data to find sfr = 1.3@xmath1510.2 m@xmath7  yr@xmath8 , for a salpeter imf , and values between 0.9 and 2.2 m@xmath7  yr@xmath8  for a range of imf slopes",
    "this may be a lower bound since it not clear that the analysis of wmap free - free emission properly accounts for lyman continuum lost from the galaxy that leaks out of chimneys to illuminate the lockman layer .",
    "@xcite present a review connecting the galactic star formation with extragalactic systems . @xcite and @xcite found that for a given surface density in nearby molecular clouds the extragalactic schmidt - kennicutt relationship underestimates the sfr , because studies of the sfr in galactic gmcs tend to ignore the surface density from extensive , non - star - forming gas ; when this is included , the galactic sfrs fit the extragalactic relationship .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure  [ fig : heiderman ] , where @xcite plot local clouds and galactic clumps onto the extragalactic star formation relationship .",
    "the figure shows an order of magnitude range in sfr at any given gas surface density . for individual protostellar clumps cataloged by @xcite using hi - gal data , we can derive the sfr and mass per unit area",

    "investigation of the galactic distribution of the @xmath193 embedded , young massive objects in the rms survey , one third of which are above the completeness limit of @xmath194  l@xmath7@xcite , shows that the distribution of massive star formation in the milky way is correlated with a model of four spiral arms . the increase in sfr density in spiral arms is due to the pile - up of clumps , rather than to a higher specific rate of conversion of clumps into stars ( a higher sfe ) . that the source and luminosity surface densities of rms sources are correlated with the surface density of the molecular gas ,",
    "suggests that the massive star - formation rate per unit molecular mass is approximately constant across the galaxy .",
    "the total luminosity of the embedded massive - star population is found to be @xmath195  l@xmath7 , 30% of which is associated with the ten most active star forming complexes .    given the enormous reservoir of dense h@xmath33 in the cmz , a high sfr might be expected there .",
