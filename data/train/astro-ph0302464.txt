    "discrepancy between observation and theoretical predictions of the apsidal motion of certain detached binary stars has remained an outstanding problem for two decades . in the cases of as cam and di her , for example , observed apsidal motion rates are a fraction of the theoretical predictions based on stellar structure , tidal , and relativistic effects .    as was first pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the effect of relativistic gravity is significant in the case of a number of detached binary stars .",
    "although he considered only di  her in detail , the number of interesting cases has grown to about half a dozen @xcite , including as cam @xcite .",
    "the discovery of anomalous apsidal motion by @xcite was initially considered a possible challenge to general relativity .",
    "@xcite invented an alternative theory of gravity that harbored differing predictions for the apsidal motion of binary stars and yet maintained agreement with other tests of general relativity .",
    "the predictive power of this theory is weakened by the existence of a new adjustable parameter for each star . moreover",
    ", increasingly severe tests of general relativity such as in @xcite make such large deviations at au scales seem unlikely .",
    "several other , less exotic , solutions have been proposed . in one scenario",
    "the rapid circularization of the orbit occurs because of dissipation of angular momentum from stellar oscillations or a large amount of mass loss .",
    "another reasonable guess is that the close binary system ( cbs ) orbit is surrounded by a resisting medium in the form of gas clouds .",
    "the required density well exceeds observational limits in the case of di  her , however . these and other alternatives are reviewed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate the feasibility of one particular explanation that has been put forward in the literature .",
    "our considerations may also find application in other triple star or suspected triple star systems such as in @xcite where a triple star model for the x - ray pulsar ax j0051 - 733 is proposed to explain puzzling features of the spectrum of a candidate optical counterpart .",
    "it is well known that the hypothesis of third stars in outer orbits of these close binary systems can bring theory into line with observed apsidal periods @xcite , but the stability of such triple star systems has been in doubt @xcite .",
    "we show here that the inclusion of the apsidal motion as an additional perturbation leads to the conclusion that such triple star motions can be stable . in particular , the triple star models of @xcite and @xcite which reconcile the cases of as cam and",
    "di her with observations are shown to be stable .",
    "furthermore , we show that observations utilizing the new keck interferometer should be able to directly image the putative third bodies in these two systems .",
    "we have studied numerically the dynamical evolution of a hierarchical triple system consisting of a massive cbs and a third star of moderate mass .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the notation used .",
    "the calculations were done perturbatively using the disturbing function method @xcite . we have assumed that the three stars are pointlike and isolated from other stars .",
    "we ignore internal dynamical exchanges such as synchronization , angular momentum exchange , and orbital precession of the cbs .",
    "classical tidal effects and relativistic effects are assumed to be independent and additive .",
    "the disturbing functions for the cbs and the third - body are adapted from @xcite .",
    "they are , respectively ,    @xmath0    we average @xmath1 and @xmath2 over the mean anomalies of the cbs and third - body ( hence , twice averaged ) .",
    "the first - order terms of the twice - averaged disturbing functions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are    @xmath5\\\\   r^{tb}_{2}&=&{{q(1+q+q')\\over{q'(1+q)^{2}}}r_{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the masses are included via the ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we choose our units of measurement to be au , years , and solar masses , so that the newtonian gravitational constant is @xmath8 .",
    "the orientation of the third - body orbital plane with respect to the close binary orbital plane is described by the direction cosines ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) of the unit vector normal to the third - body orbital plane .",
    "we refer the direction cosines to the periastron , a perpendicular to the periastron , and the direction normal to the close binary orbit .",
    "let @xmath12 be the angle between the two orbital planes , and call the angle measured from the periastron to the line of intersection of the orbital planes @xmath13 .",
    "we then have    @xmath14    since we are averaging over the mean anomaly , there is no lagrange planetary equation for @xmath15 and furthermore the semimajor axis @xmath16 has no time dependence . the planetary equations for the perturbation of the remaining cbs orbital elements by the third - body are    @xmath17   \\label{eq : omegamotion } \\\\ { ( { { di}\\over{dt}})}_{tb}&=&an\\left[{{1 + 4e^{2}\\over{1-e^{2 } } } q \\cos\\omega}-s   \\sin\\omega\\right ]",

    "these cosines are    @xmath21    finally , we use cosines of the direction perpendicular to the third body nodal line and behind the visual plane . these cosines are    @xmath22\\sin \\omega - \\sin(\\omega'-\\omega)\\cos i ' \\cos\\omega \\label{eq : t } \\\\",

    "v&=&\\cos(\\omega'-\\omega)\\sin i \\cos i ' - \\cos i \\sin i ' \\label{eq : v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "it is worth noting that the equations of motion can be written in a particularly elegant fashion by noting that they determine nothing more than an instantaneous rotation that can be referred to the cbs coordinates .",
    "the problem is then to express @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 in terms of this angular velocity vector@xcite . referring to this angular velocity as @xmath27 ,",
    "we first resolve it into three components : @xmath28 .",
    "these components are related by rotation(s ) to the angular velocity components .",
    "for example , @xmath29 is just @xmath30 referred to the nodal line @xmath31 .",
    "referring to figure  [ f1 ] , we see that a rotation by @xmath32 about the @xmath33-axis brings this angular velocity into the cbs system ; thus    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the components of @xmath27 in the cbs coordinates . proceeding in this manner , one obtains three equations giving @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in terms of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath38 .",
    "these equations are inverted to yield    @xmath39 + z   \\label{eq : omegamotionalter } \\\\ { { di}\\over{dt}}&= & -x\\cos\\omega + y\\sin\\omega \\label{eq : imotionalter } \\\\ { { d\\omega}\\over{dt}}&= & -\\csc i [ x\\sin\\omega + y\\cos\\omega ]    \\label{eq : omegamotionalter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similar considerations for a circular third - body orbit result in    @xmath40    comparing equations  ( [ eq : omegamotionalter][eq : omegamotionalter ] ) with ( [ eq : omegamotion][eq : omegamotion ] ) , we determine the rate of rotation of the cbs frame , as measured by cbs coordinates , to be    @xmath41    it has been pointed out by @xcite ( using different angles to define orbit orientations ) that this formulation admits two exact integrals and leads to a first - order elliptical differential equation for the eccentricity . our calculations , however , are entirely numerical and are based on equations ( [ eq : amotion][eq : omegamotion ] ) and ( [ eq : aprimemotion][eq : omegaprimemotion ] ) .",
    "there are a couple of ways of seeing the problem of instability .",
    "one approach utilizes the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 , so that the @xmath43 term in equation  ( [ eq : omegamotion ] ) can be ignored .",
    "this leads to a large eccentricity excursion due to the angular momentum exchange between the cbs and the third - body .",
    "since the disturbing function @xmath4 depends on neither @xmath44 ( the mean anomaly ) nor @xmath45 ( the longitude of the periastron of the third - body with respect to the ascending node ) , there is no secular variation of the third - body semimajor axis @xmath46 and eccentricity @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the orbit of the third - body maintains its shape , and the magnitude of its orbital angular momentum @xmath48 is a constant of motion .",
    "the direction of the third - body orbital angular momentum , however , will change , as the following argument shows .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the close binary system @xmath49 is 310 times smaller than @xmath50 for the systems under investigation .",
    "since the rotational angular momentum of the stars is about 2 orders of magnitude less than @xmath50 , the total angular momentum of the system is @xmath51 .",
    "calculations reveal that the cbs angular momentum is transferred to the third star . since the magnitude of @xmath48 can not change , this angular momentum transfer forces a change in the orientation of the third - body orbit with respect to the total angular momentum .",
    "conservation of angular momentum dictates the connection between @xmath12 and @xmath52 shown in figure  [ f2 ] . as angular momentum",
    "is transferred , the coordinate values @xmath53 slide along one of the integral curves determined from the initial values of the eccentricities @xmath52 and @xmath47 , mass ratios @xmath54 and @xmath55 , relative inclination @xmath12 and ratio of the semimajor axes @xmath56 . in the presence of a small but nonzero @xmath43",
    "the above argument does not take the orbit all the way to @xmath57 , but the eccentricity may become close enough to unity that tidal effects or even collision destroy the system .",
    "this turns out to be the case for di  her and as  cam .",
    "we can gain additional insight into the dynamics of the eccentricity by looking directly at the equations of motion . more specifically ,",
    "we look at equation ( [ eq : omegamotion ] ) neglecting the @xmath43 term and further assume that the motion of the nodal line @xmath58 caused by nutation and precession of the orbits is small .",
    "under these assumptions ,    @xmath59 \\label{eq : omegamotionnocoti } \\\\ { ( { { d\\omega}\\over{dt}})}_{tb}&\\approx&-{({{d\\phi}\\over{dt}})}_{tb }   \\label{eq : phimotion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    first , we note that for @xmath60 we have @xmath61 .",
    "we see then that the righthand side of equation  ( [ eq : omegamotion ] ) is always positive .",
    "thus @xmath32 and @xmath13 change monotonically and run over all quadrants , never coming to rest .",
    "therefore , the perturbations in the eccentricity ( equation  ( [ eq : emotion ] ) ) are periodic , and the eccentricity suffers no excursion to a value nearing unity .",
    "the situation is much different if @xmath62 . at such inclinations ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : omegamotion ] ) implies in general four values of @xmath13 for which @xmath63 .",
    "let us examine the motion of @xmath13 at these roots .",
    "equations ( [ eq : omegamotionnocoti ] ) and ( [ eq : phimotion ] ) together imply    @xmath64    this tells us that the four points of stationary @xmath32 ( and @xmath13 ) will be stable only if @xmath65 .",
    "looking at equation ( [ eq : emotion ] ) we see that this same condition guarantees @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath13 will wander until it reaches a value that results in an eccentricity excursion .",
    "again , we emphasize that these semi - quantitative arguments are limited to the extent that we neglect the @xmath43 term in equation ( [ eq : omegamotion ] )",
    ".    the characteristic time scale for the change of eccentricity can be obtained from equation  ( [ eq : emotion ] ) :    @xmath67    for di her and as cam these times are about 700 and 400 yr respectively , as was confirmed directly by numerical integration .",
    "thus at first glance the conclusion seems to be that only nearly coplanar hierarchical triple systems can be stable for more than a few hundred years .",
    "if this conclusion were correct , the third - body hypothesis would be eliminated as a probable solution to the apsidal motion discrepancy .",
    "we now explore the consequences of including the effect of stellar structure ( namely tidal - rotational deformation of the cbs pair ) and the relativistic effect as additive perturbations on the motion of @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the structure effect @xmath68 and the relativistic effect @xmath69 act in simple superposition with the effect of the third - body @xmath70 , so that their influence can be represented by simply adding them to @xmath71 . if the combined effect of these two additional terms is of the same order or greater than the third - body effect , that is , if    @xmath72    then the motion of @xmath32 will not stop .",
    "thus @xmath32 and @xmath13 will change monotonically , resulting in periodic perturbations of the orbital elements of the cbs leading to stability , as in the case of low inclinations discussed above .",
    "we can derive stability criteria on the basis of equation  ( [ eq : omegacondition ] ) .",
    "we consider the cases in which either the classical deformation effect or the relativistic effect dominates using well - known relationships for @xmath68 from @xcite and @xmath69 from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the classical effect dominates in the sense that @xmath73 , we have    @xmath74    if the relativistic effect is predominant [ @xmath75 , then    @xmath76    table  [ table1 ] displays the application of these criteria to as cam and di her .",
    "we see that , according to our hypothesis , both of these supposed triple star systems are predicted to be stable .",
    "the stability of as cam is provided by the classical effect whereas di her is stable because of the relativistic apsidal motion .",
    "we have confirmed this behavior by means of numerical integrations of the equations of motion .",
    "the calculations were done perturbatively using the disturbing function method @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that the stars are pointlike , and the close encounters are ignored .",
    "we ignore internal dynamical exchanges such as synchronization , angular momentum exchange , and orbital precession of the cbs .",
    "the apsidal motion in the cbs caused by both the classical tidal - rotational deformation of the components and the relativistic apsidal motion is described by disturbing functions as in @xcite .",
    "the classical tidal effects and relativistic effects are assumed to be independent and additive .",
    "the results for as cam are shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "thus the angular momentum is transferred back and forth between the third - body and the cbs .",
    "these periodical variations in @xmath52 and @xmath12 can be visualized as a flapping of the cbs and third - body orbits , almost like a butterfly ( figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "we begin our discussion by contrasting our stability criteria with those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the case of di  her using the same orbital parameters as @xcite .",
    "@xcite allows a very close orbit of the third - body , the restriction being only that the semimajor axis satisfy @xmath77 corresponding to a period @xmath78 .",
    "this seems much too close to the inner binary for stability at any inclination of the third - body orbit .",
    "although @xcite deal primarily with the case of coplanar orbits , they indicate how their results may be extended to third - body orbits inclined to the inner binary orbit .",
    "we have applied their stability criteria assuming that the third - body orbit is perpendicular to the inner binary orbital plane .",
    "the result is that stability criterion requires @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this seems more reasonable , but in fact numerical simulations suggest that this is still too close @xcite .",
    "the criteria we propose prove more restrictive . from equation  ( [ eq : reldom ] )",
    "we determine that @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we have confirmed the stability of the purported three body system of di  her under this restriction on the third - body orbit .",
    "we also wish to emphasize that the criteria of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are all based on the purely newtonian gravitational theory of point mass orbits .",
    "our criteria depend on structure effects and/or general relativity . in the case of di",
    "her the effect of general relativity dominates .",
    "it appears that the stability of the hypothetical three body system of di  her is to be found in the physics of general relativity rather than structure effects .",
    "thus general relativity itself provides stability to the three - body model of di  her , which seems necessary to bring its theoretical apsidal motion into line with observations .",
    "a similar stabilizing role for general relativity was found by @xcite in their investigations of a planet orbiting one star of a binary system .",
    "our criteria are somewhat more general in that structure effects are also considered .",
    "we close with a discussion of the prospects of making direct observations of these hypothetical third - body companions of as  cam and di  her in light of recent advances in optical interferometry and adaptive optics .",
    "indirect evidence for a third - body in as cam ( b+b9.5 , p=3.43days , e=0.17 , v=8.6 ) has already been found by @xcite and @xcite , who found , imposed upon the timing of eclipse minima , a cyclic variation with a period of 2.2 yr .",
    "they have interpreted this signal as due to the roemer - like influence of a third star .",
    "the calculations of @xcite indicate that in order to account for the anomalous apsidal motion of as cam , the third - body should be of about @xmath85 . using this estimate , binary masses of @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite , and the 2.2  yr period",
    ", the semimajor axis of the orbit would be 3.2  au .",
    "this corresponds to a light - travel time of 27 minutes . combining this with the amplitude of 4.18  minutes measured by @xcite yields an orbital inclination of @xmath88 with respect to the line of sight , so that nearly the full 3.2 au is visible to the observer . assuming a distance of @xmath89 , the maximum angular elongation is @xmath90",
    "this is twice the resolution limit of the keck interferometer operating at @xmath91 with its @xmath92 baseline .",
    "the interpretation of eclipse timings by @xcite and @xcite also predicts the times of maximum elongation .    in the case of di",
    "herculis , no indirect indication of third light exists .",
    "however , information from past theoretical analyses provides hope that present interferometers should be capable of directly observing the putative third - body .",
    "the analysis of @xcite suggests that the minimum third - body mass is about @xmath93 and that the minimum period is about 7  yr . assuming binary masses of @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite , we conclude that the semimajor axis is at least 8 au .",
    "since the orbit is expected to be highly inclined , and the distance to di her is about @xmath96 , we expect a maximum angular elongation of @xmath97 .    of course , the ability to resolve these third bodies is of little use unless they are sufficiently bright . here",
    "infrared observations are a great advantage , since the compact binary stars are relatively massive in comparison with the hypothesized third bodies .",
    "for example , applying the mass - luminosity relationship to as cam , we conclude that the third star should have a total luminosity less than the system by 4.3  mag .",
    "a simple calculation based on the planck distribution and assumed temperatures of @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the binary and third star , respectively , predicts that , in the @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) bands , the third star is dimmer by only about 1  mag .",
    "a similar calculation for di her predicts that in the @xmath100 and @xmath102 bands the third star is dimmer than the system by 3.5  mag .",
    "finally , the magnitudes of these systems are such that the compact binary stars may serve as natural guide stars for adaptive optics in the case of the keck interferometer .    bolstered by indirect evidence in the case of as cam and dynamical stability indicated by the considerations of this paper , the case for a third - body solution to the long standing problem of anomalous apsidal motion is stronger than ever .",
    "the final judgment , however , may soon be expected from the current generation of interferometers .",
