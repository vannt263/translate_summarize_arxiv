    "ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions in a partonic picture can be divided into three stages : ( 1 ) during the early stage , hard or semihard parton scatterings , which happen on a time scale of about 0.2 fm/@xmath0 , produce a hot and dilute parton gas .",
    "this parton gas is dominated by gluons and its quark content is far below the chemical equilibrium value .",
    "multiple hard scatterings suffered by a single parton during this short period of time when the beam partons pass through each other are suppressed due to the interference embedded in the glauber formula for multiple scatterings @xcite .",
    "this leads to the observed disapparence of the cronin effect at high energy and at large transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "interference and parton fusion also lead to the depletion of small-@xmath1 partons in the effective parton distributions inside a nucleus @xcite .",

    "this correlation reduces the pre - thermal charm production as compared to the uncorrelated one used in a previous estimate @xcite .",
    "we found that both the thermal contribution during the parton equilibration and pre - thermal contribution with the current estimate of the initial parton density from hijing monte carlo simulation are much smaller than the initial direct charm production .",
    "however , the final total charm production is very sensitive to the initial condition of the parton evolution . if uncertainties in the initial parton production can increase the initial parton density , _",
    "e.g. _ , by a factor of 4 , the total secondary charm production will become comparable or larger than the initial production , due to both the increased production rate and longer life time of the parton plasma . we also found that open charm production is more sensitive to the initial temperature of the parton system than the initial parton fugacities .",
    "therefore , open charm production is a good probe of the initial parton distribution in phase - space and the thermalizaion and equilibration time of the parton plasma .",
