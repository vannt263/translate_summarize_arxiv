    "it is an important class of physical theories , that admit the formulation as a gravity coupled coset space @xmath0-model after dimensional reduction to two dimensions . including pure gravity and kaluza - klein theories as well as extended supergravity theories , in @xmath1 dimensions they are described by a set of scalar and vector fields coupled to gravity , where the scalar fields already form a non - linear @xmath0-model .",
    "further reduction is achieved by imposing additional symmetries  manifest by assuming two additional commuting killing vector fields , for example corresponding to the study of axisymmetric stationary models .",
    "this reduction to effectively two dimensions leads to a non - linear @xmath0-model in an enlarged coset space , coupled to two - dimensional gravity and a dilaton field .",
    "the arising additional scalar fields that contribute to parametrizing the coset space are remnant of the original vector fields and of components of the former higher - dimensional metric . for general reason ,",
    "related to boundedness of the energy , it is the maximal compact subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath3 that is divided out in the coset .",
    "the first reduction of this type , discovered for pure gravity , leads to the simplest coset space @xmath4 .",
    "it was generalized up to the case of maximally extended @xmath5 supergravity , where the @xmath6 arises .",
    "the general proceeding was analyzed in .    in a program",
    "was started to perform an exact quantization of these dimensionally reduced gravity models .",
    "progress has been achieved using methods and techniques similar to those developed in the theory of flat space integrable systems . despite the fact that dimensional reduction via additional symmetries represents an essential truncation of the theory ,",
    "these so - called `` midi - superspace '' models under investigation are sufficiently complicated to justify the hope , that their exact quantization might provide insights into fundamental features of a still outstanding quantized theory of gravitation . in particular and in contrast to",
    "previously exactly quantized `` mini - superspace '' models , they exhibit an infinite number of degrees of freedom , which is broadly accepted to be a sine qua non for any significant model of quantum gravity ( compare for a discussion of this point in the context of related models ) .    one of the final purposes of this approach is the identification of exact quantum states , whose classical limit corresponds to the known classical solutions . for pure gravity",
    "this includes the quantum analogue of the kerr solution describing the rotating black hole ; for extended supergravities recently discovered corresponding solutions have been of particular interest exhibiting fundamental duality symmetries , such that their exact quantum counterparts should shed further light onto the role of these symmetries in a quantized theory .",
    "the main ideas of the new framework are the following : exploiting the integrability of the model , new fundamental variables have been identified ( certain components of the flat connection of the auxiliary linear system continued into the plane of the spectral parameter ) , in terms of which the  right \" and  left \" moving sectors have been completely decoupled .",
    "the quantization is further performed in the framework of a generalized `` two - time '' hamiltonian formalism , i.e.  these sectors are quantized independently .",
    "the whole procedure has been established in that sector of the theory , where the new fundamental connection exhibits simple poles at fixed singularities .    in the present paper",
    "we achieve the consistent general formulation of the desired coset - models in this approach .",
    "so far the formalism was mainly elaborated in the technically simplified principal model , where the coset @xmath7 had been replaced by the group @xmath3 itself . for the coset model",
    "the phase space spanned by the new variables is too large and must be restricted by proper constraints .",
    "their canonical treatment requires a dirac procedure , which effectively reduces the degrees of freedom .",
    "it leads to a consistent analogous hamiltonian formulation of the coset model allowing canonical quantization .",
    "exact quantum states are shown to be in correspondence to solutions of a modified ( coset ) knizhnik - zamolodchikov system .",
    "moreover , the formalism is kept general as long as possible , without restricting to the simple pole sector . in particular , we completely extend it to the case of connections with poles of arbitrary high order at fixed singularities , which span the isomonodromic sector of the theory .",
    "generalization of the scheme to the full phase space is sketched in appendix [ beyi ] .",
    "the other main result of this paper is the identification of classical and quantum observables . for the above mentioned simple pole sector , these sets are complete .",
    "natural candidates for classical observables are the monodromies of the fundamental connection in the plane of the variable spectral parameter .",
    "we determine their ( quadratic ) poisson structure .",
    "after quantization of the connection quantum counterparts of these monodromy matrices are identified as monodromies of certain higher - dimensional kz - systems .",
    "following drinfeld their algebraic structure may be determined to build some quasi - associative braided bialgebra .",
    "the classical limit of this structure coincides with the poisson algebra of the classical monodromies found above . in this sense , complete consistency of the picture",
    "is established .",
    "the weakened coassociativity leads to a quantum algebra of observables with operator - valued structure constants .",
    "this might have been avoided by directly quantizing the regularized classical algebra of monodromies , as is common in chern - simons theory , instead of recovering quantum monodromies in the picture of the quantized connection .",
    "we discuss this link and its consequences .",
    "the treatment of observables is performed in great detail for the simplified principal model mentioned above .",
    "this is for the sake of clarity of the presentation , since the arising difficulties in the coset case deserve an extra study in the sequel .",
    "however , the main tools and strategies that will finally be required can already and clearer be developed and used in this context .",
    "the modifications required for the coset model are clarified afterwards .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in chapter 2",
    "we start by introducing the known linear system associated to the model and describe the related on - shell conformal symmetry . a short summary and generalization of the results from about the classical treatment of the principal model",
    "is given without restricting to the simple pole sector .",
    "the link to hamiltonian chern - simons theory is discussed , where the same holomorphic poisson structure is obtained by symplectic reduction of the complexified phase space in a holomorphic gauge fixing .",
    "this link in particular enables us to relate the status of observables in both theories .",
    "observables in terms of monodromy matrices are identified ; their poisson structure is calculated and discussed .",
    "the technical part of the calculation is shifted into appendix [ pmono ] .",
    "chapter 3 treats the quantization of the principal model .",
    "we first briefly repeat the quantization of the simple pole sector of this model .",
    "quantum analogues of the monodromy matrices are defined .",
    "their algebraic structure and its classical limit are determined and shown to be consistent with the classical results .",
    "the alternative treatment in chern - simons theory and the identification of quantum observables in these approaches are discussed .    in chapter 4 we finally present the generalization of the formalism to the coset models .",
    "a hamiltonian formulation in terms of modified fundamental variables is provided .",
    "the coset constraints are explicitly solved by a dirac procedure .",
    "furthermore , we quantize the simple pole sector of the coset model , showing that solutions of a modified knizhnik - zamolodchikov - system identify physical quantum states , i.e.  exact solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equations .",
    "we close with a sketch of how to employ the whole machinery to the simplest case of pure four - dimensional axisymmetric stationary gravity .",
    "in particular , the existence of normalizable quantum states is shown .",
    "chapter 5 briefly summarizes the open problems for future work .",
    "the model to be studied in this paper is described by the following two - dimensional lagrangian : [ lagrangian ] = e(r + h^ ) here , @xmath8 is the @xmath9 ( `` worldsheet '' ) metric , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the gaussian curvature of @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the dilaton field and @xmath14 takes values in some real coset space @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the maximal compact subgroup of @xmath3 .",

    "let us first briefly describe further reduction of the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) by means of gauge fixing and state the resulting equations of motion .",
    "the residual freedom of coordinate transformations can be used to achieve conformal gauge of the @xmath9 metric @xmath8 : h_dx^dx^ = h(z , ) dzd , with world - sheet coordinates @xmath21 , which reduces the lagrangian to =( h r + tr [ g_z g^-1 g_g^-1 ] ) . in this gauge",

    "the transformation shows that this equation is , in contrast to ernst equation itself , mbius invariant in the @xmath44-plane .      here",
    "we present a generalized version of the `` two - time '' hamiltonian formalism of the principal @xmath0-model proposed in .",
    "it is the strategy to define a new set of fundamental variables by means of exploiting the corresponding linear system .",
    "these variables may be equipped with a poisson structure such that a two - time hamiltonian formulation of the model is achieved .",
    "the main objects we are going to consider as fundamental variables in the sequel are certain components of the following one - form    let @xmath45 be a solution of the linear system ( [ ls ] ) .",

    "the spirit of generalized `` several - times '' hamiltonian formalism is described for example in .    for this purpose",
    "we equip @xmath51 with the following ( equal @xmath44 ) poisson structure :    define the poisson bracket on @xmath61 as : \\{a^a(),a^b ( ) } = -f^abc , @xmath62 being the structure constants of @xmath63 .",
