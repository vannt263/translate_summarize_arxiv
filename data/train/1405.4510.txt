    "given a complete directed graph @xmath0 with nonnegative vertex weight @xmath1 and nonnegative arcs cost @xmath2 , , the linear ordering problem with cumulative costs ( lopcc ) aims to find a permutation @xmath3 of the @xmath4 vertices of @xmath5 such that the following function is minimized : @xmath6 where @xmath7 lopcc was originally introduced in @xcite to formulate a practical problem appeared in wireless communication systems .",
    "since then , a number of solution approaches have been proposed to solve this problem .",
    "proposed a heuristic approach based on greedy construction @xcite , which randomly selects a vertex from a reduced candidate list of the best available vertices and inserts the vertex into the under construction .",
    "this algorithm is very fast , but its solution quality is generally unsatisfactory .",
    "righini proposed an exact algorithm using branch - and - bound and a truncated branch - and - bound heuristic algorithm ( tb&b ) @xcite . despite of its promising results ,",
    "the high computational time cost of tb&b still prevented this algorithm from solving problems of size larger than @xmath8 in a reasonable time .",
    "on the other hand , a number of metaheuristic algorithms were proposed to solve the lopcc problem and proved to be effective to find high - quality solutions in a reasonable time .",
    "some representative metaheuristic approaches include iterated local search @xcite , tabu search @xcite , iterated greedy - strategic oscillation and path - relinking @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , large instances ( e.g. , graphs with @xmath9 ) still represent a real challenge for all existing lopcc approaches .",
    "this paper presents for the first time a memetic algorithm for solving the lopcc problem .",
    "the proposed algorithm integrates a new local search procedure within the framework of evolutionary computing .",
    "in particular , the proposed algorithm employs an order - based recombination operator and replacement strategy for population updating .",
    "the performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on a total of 118 lopcc benchmark instances from the literature .",
    "computational experiments show that the memetic algorithm matches the previous best solutions for 61 instances and improves the previous best solutions in 46 cases . to provide insights about the performance of the proposed algorithm",
    ", we analyze the influence of some critical ingredients of the algorithm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the key components of the memetic algorithm : the local search procedure , the recombination operator and the pool updating strategy .",
    "section 3 gives the computational results and the comparison between the memetic algorithm and some state - of - the - art algorithms in the literature .",
    "section 4 investigates several essential components of the proposed algorithm and conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "memetic algorithms are known to be a powerful framework to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems ( see e.g. @xcite ) . by combining the evolutionary framework with the local search procedure ,",
    "memetic algorithms are expected to offer a balance between an intensified examination of a given search region and an exploratory discovery of new promising areas .    following the general design principle of memetic algorithms @xcite , our memetic approach alternates between a recombination phase to generate new solutions and a local optimization phase to search around the newly generated solutions . specifically , starting with a population of initial solutions ,",
    "the algorithm repeats a number of evolution cycles ( also called generations ) . at each generation , two parent solutions are randomly chosen from the current population . then the recombination operator is applied to the parent solutions to generate an offspring solution which is subsequently optimized by the local search procedure .",
    "finally , the population is updated with the improved offspring solution according to this process is repeated until a stop condition ( e.g. , number of generations , computing time ) is met .",
    "the main scheme of the memetic algorithm is described in algorithm [ main_mem ] , and the detailed descriptions of the four main components ( i.e. , population initialization , local search procedure , recombination operator and population updating strategy ) are provided in the following subsections .    *",

    "a random permutation is first created and then improved by the local search procedure ( see section [ subsec_local search ] ) .",
    "if the improved solution is not already present in the population , it is added into the population .",
    "otherwise , this solution is discarded and a new random permutation is created .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the population is filled with @xmath11 solutions ( @xmath24 is the population size ) .",
    "given a solution @xmath25 ( i.e. , a permutation ) , we generate a neighboring solution by applying to @xmath25 an operator called _ insert _ , which moves a vertex from its current position @xmath26 to another position @xmath27 , denoted by _ _ insert__@xmath28 .",
    "this operator is widely used in the _ classical _ linear ordering problem ( lop ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to accelerate the evaluation of neighboring solutions ,",
    "we employ a fast incremental evaluation technique introduced for lop in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to maintain a special data structure to record the move values for swapping adjacent vertices .",
    "particularly , each _ insert _ move is decomposed into several _ swap _ moves , which sequentially exchanges the vertices in adjacent positions .",
    "experiments show that this method can reduce the computational time of the local search procedure by about 65% .",

    "specifically , two solutions in the current population are randomly selected as parent solutions . to maintain the diversity of the population , we restrict that the _ similarity _ ( see section [ sec_analysis ] ) between the parent solutions should not be smaller than the average _ similarity _ of the solutions in the population",
    ".    then , the order - based recombination operates in two phases .",
    "first , we copy one of the parents to the offspring solution .",

    "for example , we assume that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the two parent solutions and 2,4,6 are respectively the selected positions .",
