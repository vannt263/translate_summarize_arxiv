    "this yields strong constraints on the structure of the jet in cyg x-1 , in particular it implies that a major part of this emission takes place at distances comparable to the binary orbit .",

    ", the other hemisphere of the donor , shaded from the x - rays , emits a normal wind , similar to that of an isolated massive star @xcite . summarizing , the wind of hde 226868 has three main components : the wind focused along the axis joining the stars , which carries most of the mass loss ; the standard radiatively driven wind from the hemisphere in the shadow , and a weak wind component from the donor hemisphere facing the black hole . as found by @xcite ,",
    "this third component is weak in both spectral states , hard and soft , of cyg x-1 .",
    "radio photons are emitted by the jet relatively high above the orbital plane and may be attenuated mainly by this third weak component , i.e. , the quasi - spherical wind from the hemisphere facing the x - ray source . given its weakness , it has @xmath144 , but no specific constraints are currently available . for the wind velocity profile , we use here that of equation ( [ velocity ] ) with @xmath145 cm s@xmath20 and @xmath146 @xcite .    the stellar luminosity for our assumed parameters is @xmath147 erg s@xmath20 .",

    "the fit is based on the data at @xmath154 kev , and it quite severely underestimates the actual spectrum in softer x - rays . however , the main contribution to compton heating is from hard x - rays , see equation ( [ compton2 ] ) , and thus this underestimate has a negligible effect .",
    "we note that the klein - nishina correction is very important for this spectrum , with the compton heating rate calculated non - relativistically , with @xmath155 , being 2.7 times higher than the correct rate calculated using @xmath33 of equation ( [ g_e ] ) . on the other hand",

    "the emission in the hard state is known to be extended .",
    "s01 have found that @xmath1591/2 of emission at 8.4 ghz observed by vlba is within the beam of a longitudinal extent of @xmath160 , whereas the remainder forms an extended jet visible up to @xmath161 .",
    "this has been confirmed by further vlba observations at 8.4 ghz reported in @xcite , in which the resolved fraction was @xmath1620.4 .",
    "the resolution of @xmath163 corresponds to the length of @xmath164 cm , which is @xmath165 .",
    "the resolved 8 ghz emission can thus have only a tiny orbital modulation .    the observational situation at 15 ghz is more complex .",
    "the vlba beam size of the observations reported in @xcite is @xmath166 , which corresponds to @xmath167 cm @xmath168 .",
    "the unresolved and total fluxes for the three observations taken on the same days as the 8.4 ghz ones of s01 ( i.e. , mjd 51035 , 51037 , 51039 ) are ( 7.3 , 7.7 ) mjy , ( 10.9 , 12.2 ) mjy , ( 6.1 , 7.8 ) mjy .",
    "thus , the unresolved fractions are relatively small , 0.050.22 . however , cyg x-1 was also monitored by the ryle telescope three times on each of those days , yielding the total fluxes of ( 13.2 , 14.9 , 16.0 mjy ) , ( 13.2 , 12.2 , 10.4 mjy ) , ( 18.9 , 19.4 , 18.1 mjy ) , respectively , i.e. , substantially more than the total vlba fluxes for the 1st and 3rd observation .",
    "although all of the ryle observations were taken @xmath169 d before the start of the vlba observations , cyg x-1 was in a relatively stable state at that time with no large - amplitude variability detected .",
    "it thus appears that the vlba measurement missed an extended part of the resolved emission .",
    "then , the resolved fractions are @xmath1700.7 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , it is unlikely that the radio jet in cyg x-1 follows a single set of power - law dependencies from its base to the resolved parts .",
    "it appears that it contains a compact part within @xmath171@xmath172 , and then a secondary dissipation event leads to formation of a more extended part of the jet , resolved by vlba .",
    "the observed strong orbital modulation ( see below ) has to occur in the compact part .",
    "the division of the fluxes between the two parts as a function of time remains unknown .",
    "based on the above data , we can only roughly estimate that about a half of the flux is emitted by the compact part .",
    "given that the radio - ir spectrum of cyg x-1 appears to be a single power law @xcite , both components have approximately the same spectra .",
    "with the model developed in section [ wind ] , we can fit the orbital modulation profiles , which are given by the light curves averaged and folded over the orbital period . in this way",
    ", we obtain the location of the bulk of the emission , @xmath66 .",
    "we neglect the emission of the counter - jet , as its emission is beamed away from the observer and it passes through a much higher column density than that of the jet , including the dense focused component close to the binary plane .",
    "given the results discussed in section [ radio ] , we split the radio light curves into unmodulated and modulated parts , @xmath173 where @xmath174 it time .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side corresponds to emission of the inner part of the jet , within @xmath175 or so , which is orbitally modulated .",

    "is due to our inclusion of adiabatic cooling , which reduces the temperature at large radii and thus increases the wind opacity there , requiring in turn the emission place at a higher height .",
    "however , although sz07 used the same total @xmath9 as that used here , they assumed isotropy , without taking into account focusing and the reduction of the wind from the irradiated surface of the donor .",
    "this resulted in a relatively high density of the wind . as a result , the 15 ghz emission of cyg x-1 was found to be attenuated to @xmath204 , see fig .  13 in sz07 .",
    "as also shown there , the average attenuation decreased with decreasing frequency at @xmath205 ghz , to @xmath206 at 2.25 ghz , as well as also decreased with increasing frequency at @xmath207 ghz .",

    "it appears that a relatively high fraction of the radio emission is emitted far away from the binary orbit , and thus it is not orbitally modulated by the wind .",

    "these locations , corresponding to the heights at which the jet becomes optically thin to free - free absorption , appear to follow a law relatively close to @xmath341 , expected theoretically ( bk79 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite in his estimates of the power of the jet in cyg x-1 based on the model of bk79 used the vlba images of s01 , which imply that 50 per cent of the 8.4 ghz emission comes from distances @xmath342 cm , which is @xmath343 .",
    "if the entire jet would follow the emission profile of bk79 , only a tiny fraction of the emission would take place at @xmath245 ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) , and",
    "the resulting orbital modulation would be tiny and probably unobservable , whereas it is at the level @xmath20910 per cent .",
    "given that the distance of the emission should scale as @xmath344 ( bk79 ) , it would have been even more difficult to explain the @xmath20930 per cent modulation of the 15 ghz emission .",
    "a likely solution to this problem is that the observed resolved emission comes from a secondary dissipation event in the jet whereas the emission of the inner jet , at @xmath245 , is comparable to the resolved one , and it may follow the model of bk79 . this would also solve the problem of that jet power calculated by @xcite being much lower than that inferred from the observed large - scale optical nebula , presumably powered by the jet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this would solve the problem of the jet base inferred from the vlba measurements being an order of magnitude higher than that theoretically expected @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have calculated the location the jet base in cyg x-1 ( defined by the lowest distance at which significant emission takes place ) at @xmath345 .",
    "using the measurement of the turnover frequency of @xmath170 ev of @xcite , and assuming @xmath341 ( bk79 ) , gives a location of the 15 ghz emission in agreement with our results .",
    "our best data , at 15 ghz , allow us to study the orbital modulation as a function of the radio flux .",
    "we have found a strong dependence of the modulation depth , changing from @xmath346 to @xmath271 when the flux increases by a factor of about 2 .",
    "this is naturally interpreted as the height corresponding to the bulk of the emission increasing with the radio flux as a consequence of the corresponding increase of the jet power . in our case , we find @xmath63 approximately proportional to the power of about @xmath347 of the intrinsic radio flux ( i.e. , that before free - free absorption ) , which dependence is somewhat stronger than the relation in the bk79 model .",
    "based on the above results , we have estimated the effect of free - free absorption on the form of the hard - state radio / x - ray correlation in cyg x-1 , which correlation was the subject of paper i. we find the absorption has a substantial effect , but , given the uncertainty about the wind density in the polar regions of cyg x-1 , we can not accurately quantify this effect .",
    "this effect changes the correlation index , @xmath348 ( defined as @xmath349 ) , from about 1.7 , found in paper i , to about 0.71.3 .",
    "thus , cyg x-1 may have a similar correlation to that of the lmxb h1743322 , which has @xmath350 @xcite , or a number of other lmxbs , e.g. , gx 3394 @xcite and v404 cyg @xcite , where the correlation index is @xmath3510.8 .",
    "we also discuss predictions for the orbital modulation and attenuation by free - free absorption of radio emission at frequencies higher than 15 ghz . given the relatively low density of the polar wind in cyg x-1 , these effects are likely to be much weaker than estimated before ( in sz07 ) , which may explain the apparent lack of orbital modulation at @xmath352 ghz , and the 2220 ghz radio spectrum of cyg x-1 being represented by a single power law @xcite .",
    "still , it would be highly desirable to actually measure the modulation depth at high frequency , which would give us significant constraints on the structure of both the wind and the jet in cyg x-1 .",
    "in particular , this would test the possible location of the high - frequency radio emission within the focused wind component .",
    "finally , we mention that another high - mass x - ray binary with strong wind , cyg x-3 ( which is likely to contain a black - hole ) does not show any orbital modulation of its very strong radio emission . as discussed by sz07",
    ", this may be due to the binary orbit of that system being @xmath20910 times smaller than that in cyg x-1 .",
    "if the jet of cyg x-3 is similar in size to that of cyg x-1 , this would imply values of @xmath66 @xmath20910 times higher , which is likely to reduce the depth of the radio modulation to unobservable values .",

    "the jet emission can be obscured by the donor provided @xmath353 .",
    "the lack of such eclipses implies , @xmath354 in case of the lack of x - ray eclipses ( @xmath355 ) , @xmath356 , which implies no eclipses of the jet emission .",
    "thus , equation ( [ ecl ] ) is of importance only in systems where x - ray eclipses are observed ( e.g. , m33 x-7 , @xcite ) , in which case observations of eclipses of the radio emission or their lack would impose a constraint on the location of the radio - emitting region . in the case of cyg x-1 , the lack of x - ray eclipses implies @xmath357 for @xmath358 .",
    "there will be no eclipse of the counter - jet emission by the donor for either , @xmath359 for example , for @xmath360 and @xmath361 , no counter - jet eclipses correspond to @xmath362 or @xmath363 .",
    "in addition , an accretion disc with the outer radius , @xmath364 , will block the jet emission for @xmath365 .    equation ( [ tau_ff ] ) also describes the attenuation of the counter - jet emission ( in the constant velocity , constant temperature approximation ) , with the substitution of @xmath366 .",
    "note that then there is a singularity in equation ( [ tau_ff ] ) is at @xmath71 and @xmath367 , which is a true singularity , caused by photon paths going through the centre of the donor .",
    "note that the counter - jet emission is both relativistically beamed away from the line of sight and more absorbed than the direct jet emission .",
    "also , the counter - jet emission can be obscured by the star at some combinations of @xmath63 and @xmath69 , see equation ( [ icju ] ) .",
    "all these factors can account for the lack of detection of the radio counter - jet in cyg x-1 ( s01 ) .",
    "we now consider scattering or absorption proportional to the density ( which is the case for bound - free absorption ) of photons emitted by the jet and accretion flow . in the latter case , we require that the medium temperature and ionization parameter are constant along the photon length , which is a commonly adopted assumption in calculating bound - free absorption .",
    "the optical depth is then , @xmath368 where , in the case of compton scattering , @xmath369 , and @xmath370 is the scattering cross section .",
    "we can integrate equation ( [ tau_sc_v ] ) numerically , or , assuming @xmath80 , we obtain , @xmath371 as before , @xmath90 for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and equation ( [ tau_sc ] ) appears to have a singularity .",
    "however , @xmath85 is finite , @xmath372 .",
    "the other singularity at @xmath71 , @xmath367 , is a true one . at @xmath355 ,",
    "equation ( [ tau_sc ] ) yields @xmath373    cyg x-1 shows an orbital modulation at hard x - rays , at which energies the bound - free absorption is negligible , and which is most likely due to compton scattering of photons away from the line of sight by the wind electrons .",
    "the source of x - rays in this case is close to the compact object , and thus we may set @xmath355 .",
    "however , the assumption of @xmath80 leads to a significant underestimate of the actual @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we use the numerical integration of equation ( [ tau_sc_v ] ) . for the parameters of cyg x-1 listed above , we obtain @xmath374 , where the thomson cross section has been used .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite yield the orbital modulation depth at @xmath20920100 kev hard x - rays ( which photon interactions are dominated by the thomson scattering ) of @xmath3750.04 .",
    "we find @xmath376 at @xmath128 , which implies @xmath3772 .",
    "this appears to account for the wind density being enhanced near the orbital plane ( see section [ pars ] ) ."
