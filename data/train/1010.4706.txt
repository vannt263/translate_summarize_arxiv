    "a large accumulation of sterile neutrinos in a very compact region could produce a detectable x - ray flux made primarily of particle decays into mono - energetic photons in the 0.1100 kev energy range @xcite .",

    "it is important to note that an extrapolation of the counts in the area outside the extraction region indicates that the purported segue 1 emission has signal - to - noise ratio smaller than 3 .",
    "the extracted spectrum was grouped with @xmath25 to ensure at least 20 counts per bin .",
    "subsequently , an ancillary response function ( arf ) was generated through @xmath26 using the response matrix file ( rmf ) from the latest distribution in _ swift _ calibration database .",
    "we then fitted the spectrum with a simple absorbed power - law model implemented in xspec @xcite . between 0.4 and 5 kev ,",

    "line emission upper limits were calculated in steps of 0.5 kev over said energy range .",
    "we adopt a conservative posture and assume that only line emission ( no underlying continuum or instrumental background ) contributes to the observed line flux at each energy . in order to convert these measured emission line upper limits into actual points in the sterile neutrino parameter space ( mass m@xmath35 versus mixing angle @xmath36 )",

    "[ figure3 ] are about a factor of 10 less sensitive than the upper limits derived for ursa minor @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the results are even less restrictive than those reported for the milky way @xcite , m31 @xcite , and the unresolved cosmic x - ray background @xcite . however , to a large extent , estimates based on equation ( 1 ) depend exclusively on the total dark matter mass m@xmath40 rather than specific dark matter densities within the object , which may be more appropriate . at @xmath7 m@xmath5 pc@xmath8 ,",
    "the dark matter density of segue 1 is significantly ( a factor between 2 and 200 ) higher than that measured in any bound system @xcite . assuming that the sterile neutrino line emission has an additional dependence on the dark matter density @xmath47 on small scales , density weighted upper limits could be of similar magnitude .",
    "based on the observational limits reported here , an unequivocal dark matter signal continues to evade us in the x - ray regime . none the less , by focusing on regions with high dark matter density , we appear to be on the right path to discovery ( or exclusion ) .",
    "because no background subtraction was performed on the compounded spectrum of segue 1 , the exclusion region for sterile neutrinos obtained from this observation is less restrictive than previous measurements for similar systems @xcite . yet",
    ", the exercise is valuable as the hunt for an indirect dark matter signal continues from x - ray to gamma - ray energies .",
    "it is unfortunate that the observation can not confirm the presence of the spectral feature claimed in the willman 1 spectrum because of poorer sensitivity @xcite .",
    "however , the reality of this marginal spectral feature remains hotly contested @xcite .",
    "an additional concern with willman 1 is the fact that its kinematic properties make it difficult to determine its actual dark matter mass and carry out any subsequent sterile neutrino calculations @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of kinematics , segue 1 has also faced a serious challenge by @xcite who argued that the dark matter properties of segue 1 might be inflated due to possible contamination from stars in the sagittarius stream . under the latter interpretation",
    ", unrelated field stars would disturb the velocity dispersion measurements and hence inflate the inferred mass - to - light ratio of an otherwise normal stellar cluster .",
    "however , recent work counters that with additional stars such possibility is nearly ruled out @xcite . as a result ,",
    "segue 1 appears to qualify as the densest dark - matter dominated object with a robust determination of sterile neutrino parameters in the 0.87 kev bandpass .",
    "if the high dark matter density value is confirmed with further measurements , segue 1 will certainly transform itself in the ideal astrophysical laboratory to contrast any direct dark matter particle detection at ground - based accelerators .",
    "but any such effort will require that the field of view of segue 1 is certified as `` clean '' i.e. void of x - ray / gamma - ray contaminants that might entangle any interpretation of the high - energy emission other than obvious background gamma - ray quiet qsos . with the discovery of swift j100651.4 + 160845 , we have just begun to probe the x - ray point - source population in the field of segue 1 .",
    "given the potential of novel discoveries , it seems worthwhile to observe segue 1 with more sensitive x - ray instruments on board the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories that could conclusively quantify the contamination from unrelated sources .",
