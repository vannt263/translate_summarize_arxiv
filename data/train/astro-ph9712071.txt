    "the abundances and ratios of the cno isotopes in the interstellar medium ( ism ) are sensitive to details of stellar and galactic chemical evolution .",
    "many attempts have been made to measure the ratio of @xmath4c  to @xmath0c   throughout the galaxy and in the local ism , as well as in stars , to help guide the galactic evolutionary models .",
    "optical , uv , and ir absorption line techniques have been used for these measurements as well as radio emission line measurements ( see the review by wilson & rood 1994 )",
    ".    one of the most successful attempts for ism measurements has been made by langer & penzias ( 1990 & 1993 ; hereafter lp90 & lp93 ) who compared the weak emission lines of @xmath7  and @xmath11 .",
    "they found a galactic gradient in the @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  ratio ranging from @xmath12 near the galactic center to about 60 to 70 at a galactic radius ( @xmath13 ) of about 10 kpc .",
    "the value in the local ism is @xmath14 . for @xmath15 kpc , wouterloot & brand ( 1996 ) , using the same technique , found a value @xmath16 .",
    "ratios derived from observations of @xmath17 show a similar galactic gradient but are @xmath18% higher ( wilson & rood 1994 ) .",
    "unfortunately , ratios derived from both co and @xmath17 can be distorted by chemical fractionation and isotopic - selective photo - dissociation , two processes discussed further in  4 .",
    "centurin et al .  (",
    "1995 ) have reviewed the various determinations using optical absorption lines of @xmath19 and concluded that the abundance ratio in the local ism is @xmath20 .",
    "boreiko and betz ( 1996 ) have measured the @xmath21  to @xmath9  ratio for the average of several positions toward the orion nebula region .",
    "the value they found is @xmath22 .",
    "it is thought that neither of these probes should suffer from chemical fractionation effects .    in this letter",
    "we describe measurements of the ratio with another fundamental probe , neutral atomic carbon . according to pdr models ,",
    "the ratio of atomic @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  in the dense interstellar medium is particularly sensitive to the opposing effects of chemical fractionation and isotopic - selective photo - dissociation which can also affect the isotopomeric ratios of many molecules , e.g. , co and @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we use the atomic carbon isotopic ratio to assess the relative importance of these effects in one astronomical source .",
    "we compare the isotopic ratio in atomic carbon to that in co , through measurements of the weak lines of @xmath11  and @xmath7  which are similarly affected by chemical fractionation and isotopic - selective photo - dissociation as the more abundant species ( langer et al .",
    "1984 ; van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "the @xmath24  transition of @xmath4  at 492 ghz has been available for high spectral resolution measurements in molecular clouds for many years .",
    "unfortunately , the equivalent @xmath0  transition is insufficiently split from the @xmath4  line to allow its discrimination ; the largest split is only 3.6 mhz ( 2.2 @xmath25 ; yamamoto & saito 1991 ) .",
    "however , the splitting between the @xmath4  ( @xmath2 ) and the strongest hyperfine component of the @xmath0  equivalent transition , both lying near 809 ghz , is 152 mhz ( 56 @xmath25 ; klein et al .",
    "1997 ) , providing a better opportunity for detection of @xmath0 .",
    "the observations were made during two periods of good weather in 1996 december and 1997 february with the recently available 850 ghz receiver ( kooi et al .",
    "1997 ) at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "the 225 ghz zenith opacity at the time was @xmath26 , corresponding to an 809 ghz opacity of @xmath27 .",
    "we observed @xmath4  and @xmath0  in the upper sideband in 1996 december and in the lower sideband in 1997 february .",
    "there was excellent agreement between the two observing runs . using mars ( diameter 106 ) , we measured the main beam efficiency at 809 ghz to be 33% in 1997 february assuming the theoretical beamsize of 9 .",
    "our source is very extended , so the moon efficiency would be more appropriate to use in correcting the measured intensities .",
    "we estimate it to be @xmath28 .",
    "in addition we measured some of the lines of co and its isotopomers in the 21 and 32 transitions .",
    "we decided to observe the @xmath1  component of the @xmath2   transition of @xmath0  because it is the strongest of the three components , with 60% of the total line - strength .",
    "we centered this component within the quietest part of our bandpass which meant that the two weaker components were not observed .",
    "we chose to observe a position in the clump at the base of the orion bar ionization front , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 s of irc2 ) because it is known to have bright 492 ghz  lines ( tauber et al .",
    "1995 ) . unlike the bar itself",
    ", the clump does not appear to have a strong edge - on geometry .",
    "it also has a simple molecular spectrum , thus avoiding line confusion such as occurs near orion irc2 .",
    "the fine - structure energy level intervals of the @xmath4c  and @xmath0catoms have been measured with high precision in the laboratory by saykally & evenson ( 1980 ) , cooksy et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , yamamoto & saito ( 1991 ) , and most recently by klein et al .",
    "( 1997 , letter this issue ) .",
    "the observed spectra of @xmath0  and @xmath4  and the comparison isotopomeric lines of co are shown in figure 1 .",
    "this is the first detection of submillimeter emission from @xmath0c  in the ism .",
    "we measured the frequency of the @xmath4  and @xmath0  lines by comparison with the @xmath10  ( 21 ) line ( not shown ) which has a shape nearly identical to that of the @xmath4  line .",
    "the frequency we measure for the @xmath2   transition of @xmath4  is @xmath32 mhz and the frequency of the @xmath1  component of the @xmath2  transition of @xmath0  is @xmath33 mhz .",
    "these agree well with the new laboratory measurements by klein et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    to compare the atomic isotopic ratio to the molecular isotopomeric ratio we need to derive the ratio of column densities from the ratio of line intensities for both sets of data .",
    "the column density ratio is derived from the line intensity ratio as follows :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 indicates column density , @xmath36 is the measured integrated line intensity ( in k @xmath25 ) , @xmath37 is the fractional strength of the @xmath1  component of the @xmath2  transition of @xmath0 , and @xmath38 is the escape probability of the @xmath4  line photons , which compensates for the finite optical depth , @xmath39 , in the @xmath4  line .",
    "because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of the weak @xmath0  line , we use three methods of measuring line intensity ratios .",
    "first , we integrate the line intensities over the interval 5 to 14 @xmath25 .",
    "this method has the disadvantage of including excess noise outside the line core .",
    "next , we integrate over the @xmath0  and @xmath4  line profiles weighted by the @xmath4  line profile , a method used by lp90 for co isotopomers to lessen the contribution of noise outside the line core .",
    "finally , we fit gaussians to the @xmath4  line and use the same width and central velocities for the @xmath0  line .",
    "the dispersion in these determinations is low ( 4% ) and we adopt the mean value , 80 .",
    "the s / n in the line integral measurement for the @xmath0  line estimated from the noise in the baseline is @xmath40 so we assign a 15% uncertainty to the ratio .",
    "thus the measured line intensity ratio is @xmath41 .",
    "because the @xmath0  and @xmath4  lines were measured simultaneously in the same receiver sideband , there is no significant calibration uncertainty in the line intensity ratio .",
    "the @xmath0  transition has 3 hyperfine components .",
    "we assume that the excitation is thermal so that the hyperfine line intensities are proportional to the quantum mechanical line strengths and @xmath42 .",
    "= 6.8 in    the most difficult factor to estimate is the correction for the finite optical depth of the @xmath4  line .",
    "we assume that the  excitation temperature is 104 k , as we measured for the @xmath43  ( 21 ) line , and that the telescope beam efficiency for large sources is @xmath44 .",
    "the uncorrected line intensity of 17 k then corresponds to a true line intensity of @xmath45 k and an opacity @xmath46 with line escape probability @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting ratio of the @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  column densities is @xmath48 , where we have added the uncertainty in the escape probability in quadrature with that of the line intensity ratio .",
    "the co isotopomeric column density ratio is derived from the line intensity ratio as follows :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is a small correction due to the difference in the molecular excitation and the transition probabilities caused by the difference in frequency between the two lines .",
    "we use the same three methods described in  3.1 for determining line intensity ratios and adopt the mean values of these determinations : 81 for the 21 lines and 67 for 32 . because the @xmath11  lines are very weak , the uncertainties in the line ratios are substantial .",
    "one measure of the uncertainties is the ranges in the ratios determined by the three different methods .",
    "these are @xmath51% for the 21 ratio and @xmath52% for 32 .",
    "the uncertainties in the integrated line intensities for the @xmath11  21 and 32 lines , as estimated from the noise in the baselines , are 10% and 9% respectively . to be conservative we adopt the larger of the two uncertainty estimates .",
    "we have estimated the telescope efficiency to be 70% for both 21 and 32 transitions based on past determinations . because the frequencies of the two lines in each frequency range are so close , this should add little uncertainty to the ratios .",
    "a larger factor is the uncertainty in the sideband ratio , since we have double sideband receivers .",
    "we estimate this uncertainty to be 10% for each measurement or 14% for the ratio .",
    "added in quadrature to the previous uncertainties , we have 17% uncertainty for the 21 line intensity ratio and 19% for 32 .    using standard lte column density formulas we find for both the 21 and 32 lines that @xmath53 .",
    "we can also estimate this correction factor using an lvg calculation .",
    "then we find @xmath54 for 21 and @xmath55 for 32 , so uncertainty in determination of @xmath50 is small and can be neglected .",
    "we have estimated the optical depth of the @xmath7  lines using an lvg model for the @xmath7  ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) line intensities and ratio . the temperature and density",
    "are both constrained on the low ends by the line ratio which gives @xmath56 k and @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "we adopt the best fit for the temperature given by the brightness temperature of the co ( 21 ) line ( @xmath59 @xmath58 ) which has opacities of 0.09 and 0.27 and escape probabilities of 0.96 and 0.88 for the 21 and 32 lines respectively .",
    "these lie near the center of the possible range as derived from the lvg model . as a measure of the uncertainties we use the ranges of the escape probabilities , determined by the lvg calculation with different densities and temperatures .",
    "we find an uncertainty of @xmath60% for the 21 lines and @xmath61% for the 32 lines .",
    "the total uncertainty for @xmath62 is @xmath63% for the 21 line and @xmath64% for the 32 line .    finally , combining all the factors",
    ", we find that @xmath65 from the 21 lines and @xmath66 from 32 , with a weighted average of @xmath67 . in comparison ,",
    "values of the @xmath68 to @xmath69 ratio toward the orion molecular cloud previously derived from observations of @xmath7  and @xmath0@xmath7  ( 21 ) and ( 10 ) range from @xmath70 near irc2 ( lp90 ) to @xmath71 at a position @xmath72  s of irc2 ( lp93 ) .",
    "our value lies within this range and closer to the irc2 value as befits its position close to the  region .",
    "the average for the solar neighborhood is @xmath73 ( lp93 ) , so the positions near the m42  region in orion appear to be truly different from the average neighborhood value , possibly due to the strong uv field of the trapezium .",
    "as mentioned in  1 there are two major physical phenomena which can modify the abundance ratios of the various atomic and molecular forms of carbon and its isotopes .",
    "the first is chemical fractionation of @xmath10  and @xmath43 , due to the rapid exothermic exchange of @xmath9   with @xmath4c  in co preferentially forming @xmath10  ( watson , anicich & huntress 1976 ) .",
    "since @xmath0c  is formed by the recombination of @xmath9 , @xmath0c  will be depleted in favor of @xmath10 .",
    "this process is most effective where there is a large abundance of @xmath6 ions and where the temperature is low , i.e. , in the transition zone between ionized and molecular forms of carbon near the edges of molecular clouds . here",
    "ionized , atomic and molecular forms of carbon co - exist and the temperature is reduced due to the enhanced cooling by atomic and molecular species .",
    "however , if the temperature were high the rapid ion exchange would push the @xmath43  to @xmath10  ratio toward the elemental ratio .",
    "the second process is the isotopic - selective photo - dissociation of co. again , this is generally most effective near the edges of molecular clouds .",
    "it occurs because co and its isotopes are partially self - shielding , in that the photo - dissociation of co occurs through discrete lines in the ultraviolet . @xmath74",
    "molecules and dust act to partially shield co  @xmath74 through its heavily saturation  broadened uv absorption lines and dust through continuum uv absorption .",
    "@xmath43  is also very effective at shielding itself , because of its large abundance , but @xmath10  is much less so , resulting in a greater photo - dissociation rate for @xmath10  and enhancement of @xmath0c  and @xmath9  abundances at the expense of @xmath10 .",
    "the situation for photo - dissociation of @xmath7  and @xmath11  seems to be similar , although the overall rates are higher for the less abundant species ( van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "we have used the photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) model of le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to interpret our observations .",
    "this model incorporates both chemical fractionation and isotopic - selective photo - dissociation and we have used full radiative transfer , explicitly computing the mutual- and self - shielding of @xmath74 and all the co isotopomers .",
    "we ran this model for a cloud of constant density @xmath75 @xmath58  with impinging uv field of strength @xmath76 ( tauber et al .",
    "1994 ) and abundances from flower et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "the total gas phase isotopic abundance ratios were taken to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "figures 2_a _ & _ b _ show abundances and column densities of the majority carbon species as a function of extinction in the model cloud .",
    "figures 2_c _ & _",
    "d _ show the abundance and column density ratios of the @xmath4c  bearing species to their respective @xmath0c   bearing species , normalized by their input ratios .",
    "although most of the variation in the isotope ratios in 2_c _ takes place at visual extinctions between about 2 and 7 , we have observed a region of high column density , @xmath79 as estimated from the @xmath7  column density marked in 2_b _",
    "( @xmath80 @xmath81 ) , so that these surface effects are seen integrated with the cloud interior , as shown in 2_d _ and are thus , except for the atomic @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  ratio , greatly diluted .    an important feature of the model is that at extinctions between about 2 and 7 both @xmath10  and @xmath11  are enhanced through chemical fractionation relative to their @xmath4c  isotopomers by factors up to 2.5 ( fig .",
    "the double ratio @xmath82 displays much more extreme behavior .",
    "this ratio is affected in the same sense by both chemical fractionation and isotopic - selective photo - dissociation .",
    "the first increases the abundance of @xmath10  while the second decreases the abundance of @xmath7 .",
    "the result is that @xmath10  is enhanced relative to @xmath7  by a factor up to 20 in the same range of extinction .",
    "another important feature is that the local abundance ratio of @xmath83 closely follows that found in c@xmath84 ( fig 2_c _ ) .",
    "these ratios vary in the opposite sense to the ratios found in co. in this model , _ where the temperature is low in the pdr ( @xmath85 k ) , chemical fractionation dominates over isotopic - selective photo - dissociation _ so that @xmath0c is underabundant in both atomic carbon and c@xmath84 but is overabundant in co.    finally , although the _ local abundance ratios _ of c and c@xmath84 track each other very well ( fig . 2_c _ ) , there is no effect due to the pdr visible in the _ column density ratio in _ c@xmath84 ( fig .",
    "2 _ d _ ) , because c@xmath84 is most abundant outside the molecular cloud where it is a majority species and where this effect is negligible .",
    "therefore , according to this model , _ the isotopic column density ratio measured in c@xmath84 should give the true isotopic gas phase abundance ratio_. boreiko and betz ( 1996 ) have measured the @xmath21  to @xmath9  ratio for the average of several positions in the orion nebula region . the value they find for the ratio is @xmath86 .",
    "in contrast , _ atomic carbon is most abundant in the model where the isotopic fractionation effects are most important_. therefore there should be a large effect on the isotopic column density ratio of atomic carbon , as seen in the model ( fig .",
    "2_d _ ) . yet",
    "the value we measure for the @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  ratio is @xmath87 , the same as the ratio in @xmath6 .    our model in figure 2_d _ does not provide a good match to the observations indicated .",
    "the observed ratio of @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  is the same as the intrinsic ratio measured in @xmath6 by boreiko & betz ( 1996 ) and is lower than that in co as measured using the rare isotopomeric species .",
    "the deviation is in the sense that this model evidently has a great deal too much chemical fractionation , which pushes the model ratio of @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  to a larger value than is consistent with our observations .",
    "we were able to achieve better agreement between our data and the model by artificially increasing the temperature within the model cloud .",
    "this higher temperature suppresses chemical fractionation within the pdr . that such a high temperature ( @xmath88 k ) may be present is indicated from observations of @xmath10  ( 65 ) toward the orion bar ( lis , schilke & keene 1997 ) but how it can be achieved physically is beyond the scope of this letter to discuss .    in summary",
    ", we have measured the @xmath4c  to @xmath0c  ratio in atomic carbon ( @xmath89 ) and find it to be the same as that in ionized carbon ( @xmath22 ; boreiko & betz 1996 ) and probably smaller than that found in @xmath7  ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath21  to @xmath9  should indicate the intrinsic isotopic abundance ratio since this is a majority species outside molecular clouds and it should not be significantly influenced by chemical fractionation or isotopic - selective photo - dissociation at cloud edges . from the pdr model , we see that the agreement between the isotopic ratios in ionized and atomic carbon implies that in this highly illuminated region chemical fractionation must be unimportant or is compensated for by isotopic - selective photo - dissociation .",
