    "<S> comprehensive magnetic - field - orientation dependent studies of the susceptibility and de haas - van alphen effect have been carried out on single crystals of the filled skutterudites pros@xmath0as@xmath1 and laos@xmath0as@xmath1 using magnetic fields of up to 40  t. several peaks are observed in the low - field susceptibility of pros@xmath0as@xmath1 , corresponding to cascades of metamagnetic transitions separating the low - field antiferromagnetic and high - field paramagnetic metal ( pmm ) phases . </S>",
    "<S> the de haas - van alphen experiments show that the fermi - surface topologies of pros@xmath0as@xmath1 in its pmm phase and laos@xmath0as@xmath1 are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of bandstructure calculations for laos@xmath0as@xmath1 on the pros@xmath0as@xmath1 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> both observations suggest that the pr 4@xmath2 electrons contribute little to the number of itinerant quasiparticles in the pmm phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , whilst the properties of laos@xmath0as@xmath1 suggest a conventional nonmagnetic fermi liquid , the effects of direct exchange and electron correlations are detected in the pmm phase of pros@xmath0as@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the quasiparticle effective masses in pros@xmath0as@xmath1 are found to decrease with increasing field , probably reflecting the gradual suppression of magnetic fluctuations associated with proximity to the low - temperature , low - field antiferromagnetic state . </S>"
