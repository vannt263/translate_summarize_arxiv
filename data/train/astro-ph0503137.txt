    "it is widely known that the interstellar medium ( ism ) is well described as a thermally bistable fluid owing to radiative cooling and heating due to external radiation fields and cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "two stable phases are called the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) with temperature @xmath0 k and the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) with @xmath1 k , respectively .",
    "gas in an unstable phase with temperature between the wnm and cnm is decomposed into the two stable phases via thermal instability @xcite .",
    "these stable phases can be connected through interfaces in pressure equilibrium .",
    "it is important for understanding the behaviour of the ism such as the interstellar turbulence @xcite and the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to clarify the dynamics of the interface or _",
    "front _ , which corresponds to the evaporation and condensation of low temperature hi clouds .",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered isobaric and steady phase - change in the bistable fluid assuming plane - parallel geometry . in this case , because the mass flux across the interface conserves , the velocity of fluids can be estimated as an eigenvalue of the energy equation .",
    "then they pointed out the relationship between the motion of fronts , which determines the rate of evaporation or condensation of clouds , and external pressure , and the existence of _ saturation _ pressure at which a static front can exist .",
    "after that , many authors have investigated the thermally bistable flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ers92 ) treated with fluid equations in a more sophisticated manner in plane - parallel geometry . in the latter work , they formulated equations in the lagrangian coordinate . combined with the isobaric assumption",
    ", they derived a second - order ordinary differential equation in a steady state from the energy equation .",
    "moreover , they discussed the behaviour of steady solutions from a pattern - theoretical point of view .",
    "it is challenging to extend those analyses to higher dimensions while it is much useful for applying to realistic situations . @xcite",
    "numerically computed isobaric flows in three dimensional spherical geometry for the first time .",
    "they pointed out the existence of a critical size of clouds to avoid evaporation .",
    "based on ers92 , @xcite argued the case of higher dimensions .",
    "however , it is difficult to extend the lagrangian formulation in plane - parallel geometry provided by ers92 to higher dimensional geometry in a straightforward manner . therefore assuming a model equation similar to the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation",
    ", they derived the speed of frontal motion .",
    "surprisingly , they have showed that the dependence of the frontal speed on time , or radii of clouds , is dependent on the dimension of geometry . besides they have claimed that their conclusion is supported by numerical simulations .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite and @xcite also discussed the front curvature effects in a confined plasma , in which the boundary conditions are different from ours . thereby their methods are inapplicable to the ism in a straightforward way .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to reanalyse the frontal motion in @xmath2-dimensional spherically symmetric geometry , aided by pattern formation theories ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review ers92 to prepare the analysis in higher dimensional geometry . in section 3",
    "we show a systematic procedure to derive the curvature effects . in section 4",
    "we discuss the dynamics of general curved fronts . in section 5",
    "we provide conclusions and discussion .",
    "in the following , we assume isobaric evolution in which pressure is uniform over the whole system because the fluid motion is much slower than the sound speed .",
    "the basic fluid equations under the assumption of isobaric evolution are written as @xmath3 where the equation of motion is omitted because of the isobaric assumption , @xmath4 is the conductivity , @xmath5 the gas constant , @xmath6 the mean molecular weight , and @xmath7 the adiabatic index .",
    "the heat - loss function , @xmath8 , is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the cooling and heating rates , respectively . throughout this paper , we assume a single power - law of the conductivity , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for neutral gas .",
    "the energy equation ( [ eqn : energy0 ] ) under the isobaric condition is derived by applying @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is neglected for the constant pressure , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are specific entropy and enthalpy , respectively [ see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ] . dividing variables by characteristic values , we obtain dimensionless quantities , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , and introducing characteristic length @xmath20 and time - scale @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath22 . here",
    "we take @xmath21 as the cooling time - scale , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cooling rate at the characteristic temperature , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 as the field length @xcite , @xmath27 using these quantities , the basic equations become the following dimensionless form , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    it is useful to transform these equations into the lagrangian description particularly in one dimensional case as shown in ers92 . using a relation @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the dimensionless eulerian coordinate normalised by @xmath26 and @xmath33 is the lagrangian coordinate , the energy equation ( [ eqn : energy ] ) is converted as follows , @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the independent dimensionless variables and @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "further transformation introducing @xmath40 makes the above equation simpler , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that this simple form is obtained only in the one dimensional case .",

    ", we define @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a constant which is a velocity on the lagrangian coordinate",
    ". then the partial differential equation ( [ eqn:1dl ] ) becomes an ordinary differential equation , @xmath49 where the prime means differentiation with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "an analytic kink solution connecting the two stable phases is obtained when @xmath51 as shown in ers92 .",
    "the solution @xmath52 is @xmath53.\\label{eqn:1dsol}\\ ] ]    unfortunately , as mentioned above and as shown in @xcite , it is difficult to extend it to higher dimensional cases",
    ". this can be easily seen if we take a @xmath2-dimensional ( @xmath54 ) continuity , @xmath55 .",
    "because this dependence on @xmath2 produces a term explicitly depending on @xmath33 , the second derivative @xmath56 can not be regarded as @xmath57 . to avoid this difficulty , @xcite assumed that a time - dependent gl ( tdgl ) equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the lagrangian space is a good approximation for the evolution of a spherical cloud . to be free from such an assumption ,",
    "it is fruitful to be back in the eulerian space to treat the fluid equations in higher dimensions .",
    "in the eulerian space ( @xmath58 ) , introducing @xmath59 , we obtain the continuity and energy equations , @xmath60+\\frac{1}{{\\tilde{p}}}x\\nabla^{2}x.\\label{eqn : energye0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] transforming the coordinate to @xmath61 for a @xmath2-dimensional spherical cloud , @xmath62\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\qquad + \\frac{1}{{\\tilde{p}}}x''x+\\frac{1}{{\\tilde{p}}}\\frac{d-1}{r}x'x,\\label{eqn : energye}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is given by eq.([eqn : f ] ) . the radius of the cloud , @xmath65 , is hereafter defined to be the position at @xmath66 .",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath67 is defined in the rest frame of the centre of the cloud . by defining @xmath68 , which is the fluid velocity in the rest frame of the front ,",
    "the above equations become @xmath69+\\frac{1}{{\\tilde{p}}}x''x+\\frac{1}{{\\tilde{p}}}\\frac{d-1}{r}x'x.\\label{eqn : energye2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because we take @xmath70 at the cloud centre , @xmath71 must be @xmath72 in the vicinity of the centre . in the plane - parallel case @xmath73 , using the relationship @xmath74 and @xmath75 , eq.([eqn : energye ] ) can be reduced to eq.([eqn : energy ] ) , and therefore the kink solution eq.([eqn:1dl ] ) is easily proved to satisfy these equations when @xmath76 .",
    "the above equations are non - linear , so it is hard to find an analytic solution . therefore we simply assume what follows .",
    "one is that the structure of a solution is very similar to a one - dimensional ( @xmath73 ) solution .",
    "the second assumption is that the first derivative of the solution is sharply peaked at the interface , in other words , the width of the interface is very narrow compared to the scale of the cloud size .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath77 at @xmath78 . under these assumptions , it is reasonable to substitute the first and second terms of the right - hand side of eq.([eqn : energye2 ] ) into @xmath79 .",
    "thus we obtain an approximate form , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the fluid velocity passing the front at @xmath82 in the front rest frame .",
    "@xmath83 in the last term emerges because we define the position of the front at which @xmath84 .",
    "this is similar to an equation discussed by @xcite .",
    "note that the above approximation corresponds to taking the first order in the expansion of the curvature term , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the ratio of the field length @xmath26 to the radius of the cloud @xcite .",
    "thus this is valid only for @xmath87 .",
    "= 0.9    fig.[fig : u - r ] shows the fluid velocity at the front , @xmath81 , against @xmath88 for @xmath89 and 3 .",
    "the curves and symbols represent those given by the approximate solutions and numerical ones , respectively , for different values of pressure",
    ". clearly the above approximate solution well agrees with the numerical solutions . in the large limit of @xmath88",
    ", we have confirmed that the fluid velocity converges on @xmath90 .",
    "note that the cloud evaporates when @xmath71 is positive , and vice versa .    to estimate the front velocity , we need to know the relationship between @xmath81 and @xmath91 . here",
    "we evaluate @xmath92 from the results for @xmath73 case .",
    "noting that @xmath48 in eq.([eqn:1dsol ] ) corresponds to the mass flux , @xmath93 , @xmath90 can be written as @xmath94 similarly , @xmath95 where the argument 0 represents values at @xmath96 . from those , @xmath97^{1/(1+\\alpha)}.\\ ] ] thus , the motion of the front is described by @xmath98    = 0.9    fig.[fig : v - r ] shows the same as fig.[fig : u - r ] but for the front velocity @xmath91 . at @xmath99",
    ", the approximate solutions well agree with the numerical ones . on the other hand , at @xmath100 ,",
    "the deviation of the approximate solutions from the numerical ones becomes large .",
    "this might suggest that the way of estimating @xmath101 is too simple because we have found that the fluid velocity itself is well approximated by eq.([eqn : u - r ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , eq.([eqn : ac ] ) well describes the critical radius , @xmath102 , at which @xmath103 , @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , we have found that we can obtain a better fit when we replace @xmath101 by @xmath106 , while it makes the good estimation of @xmath102 worse .    in the expression of eq.([eqn : ac ] ) , an undesirable dependence on the temperature at the front remains , whose definition also has an ambiguity .",
    "this should be removed by replacing @xmath83 and @xmath107 in the curvature term by values at the maximum of @xmath108 . to do this ,",
    "however , the thickness of the front should be explicitly considered .",
    "this will be done in a subsequent work .",
    "nevertheless , we have found that it provides a good fit to numerically obtained solutions when the front is defined at the unstable equilibrium in the case of the saturation pressure , @xmath109 .",
    "apart from this , we would like to stress that the above approximate solution can be derived from values @xmath110 and @xmath101 in @xmath73 case .",
    "= 0.9    finally , we discuss the dependence of the front velocity on the front position . as mentioned in section 1 , @xcite considered the frontal motion based on a model equation similar to the tdgl equation .",
    "they found that @xmath111 when pressure is nearly equal to the saturation pressure , and @xmath112 when far from the saturation pressure . because we have already shown in fig.[fig : v - r ] that @xmath113 const .",
    "as @xmath114 when far from the saturation pressure , we show the case of @xmath109 , in which we can see only the curvature effects .",
    "fig.[fig : v - r2 ] shows a log - log plot for @xmath115 against @xmath107 for @xmath89 and 3 .",
    "it is evident that the front velocity is proportional to @xmath116 independent of @xmath2 .",
    "thus we conclude that the tdgl equation provided in the lagrangian coordinate does not provide a correct model for thermally bistable fluids .",
    "using the curvature term derived in the previous section , we discuss the dynamics of general curved fronts according to @xcite .",
    "we define the @xmath32-axis normal to the unperturbed ( straight ) front , and take a unit vector normal to the curved front , @xmath117 , with a direction from the cnm to the wnm .",
    "the situation under consideration is shown in fig.[fig : geo ] schematically . using this ,",
    "we can write @xmath118 and @xmath119 . substituting these into equation ( [ eqn : energye2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath120\\frac{x}{{\\tilde{p}}}\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\frac{1+\\alpha}{\\alpha}x^{1/(1+\\alpha)}f[z],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as done in the previous section , substituting corresponding terms in the right hand side with the one - dimensional equation and noting the existence of the direction cosine with respect to the normal direction of the unperturbed front , we obtain @xmath121,\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the velocity of the front along the @xmath32-axis , and @xmath123 is the mean curvature .",
    "when we take @xmath88 as a curvature radius , we obtain @xmath124 .",
    "this result is applicable to general curved fronts .",
    "let us consider a convex region of the cnm against the wnm , in which @xmath125 .",
    "when the cnm is evaporating ( @xmath126 ) , the sign of @xmath110 is negative . because the sign of the second term is always negative , the cnm in the convex region evaporates faster than in concave regions . when the cnm is accreting cooling wnm ( @xmath127 ) , the sign of @xmath110 is positive .",
    "thus the condensation in the convex region is slower then in concave regions .",
    "consequently , the curvature term always smooths out the curved front .",
    "note that this conclusion is valid only under the assumptions that flows are normal to the front and that the structure of the front is the same as that in the case of plane - parallel geometry , in addition to the approximation of isobaric evolution .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of thermally bistable fluids from a pattern - theoretical point of view . to evaluate the curvature effects of the front connecting the wnm and cnm ,",
    "at first , we focused on @xmath2-dimensional spherically symmetric cnm clouds . using a way of approximations often used in the field of pattern formation theories , we derived an approximate solution describing the velocity of the front . comparing with numerical solutions",
    ", we confirmed that they are in good agreement with each other , at least when the cloud size is larger than a few tens times the field length , which corresponds to the thickness of the front .",
    "we have also found that our results contradict those given by @xcite , which assumed a model equation similar to the tdgl equation .",
    "we showed that the velocity of the front is proportional to the inverse of the radius in the case of the saturation pressure , and is constant in the case of much larger clouds and/or pressure far from the saturation pressure .",
    "second , we discussed the dynamics of general curved fronts . using the obtained approximate solution , we have found that the curvature effects smooth out curved fronts .",
    "in contrast to the latter conclusion , recent numerical experiments of interstellar turbulence @xcite show that most fronts might be unstable even without strong shocks .",
    "this apparent contradiction might come from our simple assumptions that the structure of the front is independent of geometry , that the fluid motion is normal to the front , and that the fluid evolves isobarically .",
    "presumably some instability mechanisms are there similar to the darrieus - landau instability in propagating flame @xcite , or the mullins - sekerka instability in crystal growth @xcite .",
    "this work is a first step toward full understanding of the dynamical behaviour of the ism found in the numerical experiments . for fair comparison",
    ", we must clarify at least how the above assumptions affect the dynamics of the ism .",
    "we are planning to analyse the stability of the front considering these known mechanisms , as well as the validity of the isobaric evolution .",
    "together with those , hydrodynamic simulations should be performed to be compared with the results obtained in this paper .",
