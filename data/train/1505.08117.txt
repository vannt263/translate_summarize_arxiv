    "the modern electricity market is not only a system for arranging the purchase and sale of electricity using supply and demand to set the price , but , for most major grids , is a basis for electricity derivatives , such as electricity futures and options , which are actively traded . the practical significance of this part of the market is increasing as is the importance of the related scientific research @xcite .",
    "the markets of electricity derivatives have developed as a result of the liberalization and deregulation of electric power systems around the world .",
    "deregulation , introduced initially to reduce and simplify the control of the business in this field , had a final goal to reach financial efficiency of electricity markets @xcite . however , electricity is unique as it is a non - storable commodity , and the markets remain extremely inefficient @xcite .",
    "electricity prices are not a result of long - term but instant , usually on an hourly interval , balance of supply and demand . moreover , as a consequence of the complexity of a wholesale electricity market , it can show an extremely high price volatility at times of peak demand and supply shortages .",
    "this price spikes are hard to predict and financial risk management is still a high priority for participants in deregulated electricity markets due to the substantial price and volume risks that the markets can exhibit @xcite .    the problem of predictability of electricity prices in deregulated markets has been considered in many previous studies ( for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the values of prices can vary by a factor of 100 over a time scale of just several hours .",
    "these dramatic changes tend to occur in a seemingly spontaneous fashion which is sometimes erroneously interpreted as a signature of a random uncorrelated process ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed mathematical analysis reveals nontrivial auto - correlations in these sudden price jumps @xcite which indicate a possibility of prediction of electricity price movements based on the information on their historic evolution @xcite .",
    "however , it is a widely recognized fact that price fluctuations in energy markets display heavy distribution tails @xcite causing substantial difficulties in building quantitative forecasting models of price behavior .",
    "less attention has been paid to the analysis of temporal patterns underlying the observed statistical structure of electricity markets and as a result modeling of their dynamics is still in its infancy and is typically limited to day - ahead models @xcite .    in this study , we take a few next steps toward answering fundamental questions related to the predictability of electricity prices .",
    "first of all , can deregulated electricity markets reach the state of efficiency with the hurst index value close to other well - known markets , or this state is not reachable in the usual sense @xcite ? this is crucially important because if the electricity markets are inherently inefficient , the forecast can be built at various time scales . in this context , the inefficiency means that price history is relevant to the future price changes and can be used for their forecasting @xcite .",
    "the problem with pareto - type statistics plays a special part , because not all heavy distribution tails can be approximated by a single probabilistic model",
    ". they can include several dynamic ranges described by distinct pareto exponents .",
    "if such markets are predictable in principle , there might be particular price intervals for which the forecast is statistically stable , and these intervals are important to identify .",
    "another central question related to the predictability of electricity prices is how universal can be a model of electricity price behavior across different markets . in the present work",
    ", this question is addressed in frames of a quantitative analysis of electricity prices in three independent markets with different levels of liberalization ",
    "alberta , ontario ( canada ) and mid - c ( usa ) markets .",
    "dynamical and statistical properties of price fluctuations are investigated using several methods .",
    "first , we evaluate correlations in price dynamics across different time scales using the method of scale - dependent fractal exponent @xcite obtained from detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite .",
    "we also use the fourier spectral analysis to identify cyclic components in the electricity price dynamics , as well as the pareto probability distribution analysis for testing the stability of statistical moments of the studied data .",
    "spectral and dfa analysis results show no evidence of informational efficiency of electricity price fluctuations at any time scale .",
    "all three markets demonstrate different levels of inefficiency which could reflect their different sizes and structural diversification .",
    "price movements in these markets are strongly anti - persistent @xcite .",
    "together with pareto analysis results , this anti - persistence indicates that electricity price movements can be predicted based on historic price records .",
    "next , we verify the possibility of price forecasting using phase diagrams representing the correlation of previous and current price increments . according to our results ,",
    "the diagrams have a complex asymmetric shape revealing three basic scenarios of price movements .",
    "these scenarios remain the same for price movements at different time scales , from one hour up to one month , and are found to represent strongly volatile market conditions . based on these results",
    ", we show that price fluctuations in deregulated electricity markets are predictable by their nature .",
    "our findings lay a foundation for future mathematical description of multiscale dynamics in deregulated electricity markets .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section 2 contains a detailed description of the analyzed data sets .",
    "section 3 describes main results of our statistical analysis demonstrating the possibility of electricity price forecasting .",
    "this possibility is explored further in sections 4 .",
    "section 5 provides a brief summary of our study .",
    "as an outcome of the liberalization policies pursued in several countries from the 80s on , the so called day - ahead electricity market provides economists with a very challenging phenomenon .",
    "electricity can not be economically stored , which implies that demand and supply must be continuously balanced , so that the market price mainly reflects the demand and supply conditions prevailing at the very moment it has to be delivered to final users .",
    "then , rather complex market systems have been set up , with the aim of reaching a reasonable trade - off between economic efficiency and system reliability .",
    "these systems are built around a market operator , whose task is to manage uniform - price , sealed - bid , bilateral auctions in order to construct aggregate demand and supply curves , and to determine equilibrium prices and quantities .",
    "the knife - edge character of such a price setting mechanism is fatherly pushed to the extreme by a very low price elasticity of demand , and by technical constraints which time by time lead to network congestion ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    time series of hourly electricity prices in alberta ( left ) , ontario ( center ) and mid - c ( right ) markets . from top",
    "to bottom : all hourly prices , on - peak prices , and off - peak prices .",
    "alberta electricity prices demonstrate significantly higher fluctuations than those in ontario market , plotted on the same vertical scale",
    ". fluctuations of electricity prices in mid - c have twice as low amplitude as that in ontario , and about 5 times smaller than in alberta.,width=16 ]    the data studied in this paper consists of hourly real time pool electricity prices in alberta , posted by the alberta electric system operator ( aeso ) , and ontario , posted by the independent electricity system operator ( ieso ) .",
    "the data cover the period from may 1 , 2002 to june 6 , 2009 .",
    "in addition to these canadian markets , the mid columbia ( mid - c ) market has been considered during the time interval 1 july , 2001 to 31 oct , 2006 . for each of the three hourly data sets , two secondary time series consisting of electricity prices during on- and off- peak hours have also been examined .",
    "figure 1 shows the time series under study , including the original data and their on- and off- subsets .",
    "note that all plots contain numerous spikes with irregular timing and amplitude .",
    "alberta and ontario are the only two canadian provinces where wholesale electricity markets are fully deregulated @xcite .",
    "alberta s market is dominated by fossil fuel generation and as such follows more closely the price of natural gas .",
    "ontario s generation involves about 50% of nuclear and 25% of hydro power @xcite enabling a more stable price behavior @xcite .",
    "the average level of volatility of electricity prices in alberta is about twice as high as in the ontario market .",
    "the mid columbia electricity market is not as deregulated as alberta and ontario are @xcite .",
    "it is not a centralized power market , but it is a trading hub where power is bilaterally traded among utilities and marketers . the mid - c price hub is a reference price for the pacific nw region , which consists of washington , idaho , and oregon . in this region ,",
    "large utilities own generation and serve load under regulated rates .",
    "the generation is primarily hydro and the region typically exports to british columbia and california @xcite . for these reasons , mid - c prices are significantly less volatile than those in either canadian market .",
    "for testing the informational efficiency of electricity price fluctuations , multiscale correlations of price dynamics were evaluated across different time scales .",
    "two complementary approaches were used to achieve this goal  the scale - dependent dfa and the fourier spectral analysis .",
    "the former of the two approaches has been first introduced in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous methods manipulating with average scaling exponents characterizing broad scaling ranges , we investigated the distribution of local dfa exponents over all time scales involved . this approach was shown to be the only suitable when the signals under study encompass qualitatively different types of behavior including random price movements , cycles , and spikes . using the dfa as the base algorithm",
    "is justified by the presence of multiscale trends in the electricity data @xcite .",
    "the scale - dependent version of this algorithm presented in @xcite enables the investigation of complex types of nonlinear behavior of financial and economic indicators by providing detailed information on the distribution of correlations over different scales , and is especially useful for quantitative analysis of market efficiency .",

    "the averaged scatterplots of hourly price increments in the mid - c market suggest positively correlated price movements described by a positive plot slop , which is consistent with the shape of the original increment scatterplots of this market . to some extent , this tendency is present in the on - peak prices , but not in the off - peak prices .",
    "the range of price motions underlying this tendency is significantly narrower compared to that in alberta and ontario markets .",
    "the presence of reproducible patterns in the electricity price movements is in a conceptual agreement with our dfa analysis results indicating a non - efficient behavior of the studied data described by @xmath51 .",
    "such dfa behavior implies that the past and the future price movements are not statistically independent leading to a non - markovian dynamics @xcite which could be predicted .",
    "however , dfa analysis alone does not provide clues on how to build an efficient forecasting model . as we argue below",
    ", the specific shape of the increment scatterplots can serve this practically important goal .",
    "it is of particular interest to investigate the uncovered statistical tendencies on different levels of temporal aggregation .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows scatterplots of subsequent increments between electricity prices averaged over several different time sales . as can be seen from the first column of plots , the anticorrelated signature of alberta price movements",
    "is manifested on all levels of data aggregation , from several hours to more than a month .",
    "the anti - correlated behavior of the ontario market which is evident on the 12-hour time scale weakens quickly with the increase of the aggregation scale but can still be recognized even for @xmath52 ( week - to - week price movements ) .",
    "in contrast , positive correlations describing hourly mid - c prices are essentially absent on all scales exceeding @xmath53 ; moreover , the sign of the correlation changes to negative at @xmath54 . on this",
    "time scale mid - c becomes qualitatively similar to the canadian markets , speaking in favor of a possibility of universal price movement scenarios in drastically different electricity markets .",
    "statistically , the results shown in fig . [ fig7 ] indicate that the timing of the price peaks in alberta electricity market are clustered along the time axis , enabling interdependence of price increments across many aggregation scales .",
    "indeed , if the price increases occurred at random times , averaging the data would destroy the anti - correlation and the aggregated increment plots would show no structure @xcite .",
    "the clustering effect is much weaker in the ontario price movements . according to our analysis ,",
    "mid - c dynamics involves some clustering at the time scale imposed by the daily cycle and is not stochastic by its nature .    the analysis results in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] - [ fig7 ] confirm that even though the studied electricity markets are deregulated , their dynamics can be predicted at many time scales .",
    "the forecast in these markets could be built using reproducible scenarios shown schematically in fig .",
    "scenarios i - iii represent three characteristic regimes of price dynamics in canadian markets .",
    "scenario iv describes the positive hourly correlations observed in the mid - c market .",
    "it is possible that this scenario is also present in the canadian markets but is masked by their large volatility .",
    "the scenarios revealed in our study are likely to be applicable to other deregulated markets .",
    "our analysis suggests that such markets can function at different levels of price liberalization , with the mid - c and alberta markets providing the most and the least regulated examples , correspondingly .",
    "ontario represents a stable diversified market representing a transitional stage of the liberalization where the floating electricity price does not exceed a reasonable level .",
    "the asymmetry of the price movements in this market may reflect a specific pricing strategy and decisions , possibly working in canada only .",
    "it is widely known that even though the price of the electricity reflects the balance of supply and demand , it is also determined by local characteristics of the market such as the availability and the current costs of the fuel , the amount of operators , suppliers , and bidders , and other market - specific factors .",
    "therefore , if the behavior of the electricity prices is rooted in the management aspects , their regimes can not be universal .",
    "the fact that both canadian electricity markets considered here are independent , while the us mid - c market is actually a pool of several submarkets , could be also responsible for the observed differences .",
    "it could be the case that the individual dynamics of the mid - c submarkets is more similar to the canadian markets compared to the entire mid - c .",
    "we leave the investigation of this possibility for future research .",
    "diagrams of aggregated price movements for several time scales @xmath2 ranging from 12 to 720 hours .",
    "most of the plots have a distinctly asymmetric shape reflecting a casual relationship between the price movements . for the alberta and ontario plots ( first and second columns ) ,",
    "the asymmetry of the cloud of points assumes anti - persistent dependence which can be used for price forecasting .",
    "the mid - c diagrams ( third column ) take different form depending on the aggregation scale , with the persistent and anti - persistent tendencies found at @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) and @xmath55 , correspondingly . , width=16 ]     schematic diagram showing three typical scenarios of price movements .",
    "scenario i : price increase followed by a price decrease ( anti - persistent behavior ) ; scenario ii : stable price followed by price increase ; scenario iii : price decrease followed by a stable price ; scenario iv : continuing price increase ( persistent behavior ) .",
    ", width=10 ]",
    "we have investigated dynamical and statistical properties of price fluctuations in several deregulated electricity markets .",
    "the results obtained provide new information on the predictability of price movements across a range of scale starting from one hour to one month .",
    "the following main conclusions have been reached .",
    "both methods used for testing the predictability of the electricity prices ( scale - dependent dfa and fourier analyses ) clearly show that there are strong anti - persistent correlations between values of electricity prices at all temporal scales .",
    "this behavior implies that the future and the past price movements are not statistically independent .",
    "the time series of electricity prices reverse themselves significantly more often than it would be expected for a random walk , leading to negative correlations between price increments at all levels of aggregation .",
    "the obtained values of the pareto exponent indicate that all three markets are characterized by stable first and second statistical moments .",
    "this means that the anti - correlated behavior of the markets can be translated into quantitative forecasts with well - defined mathematical expectations and confidence intervals .",
    "even the most volatile alberta market exhibiting heavy - tailed price distributions passes the pareto test .",
    "the anti - correlated behavior of the studied markets involves a few simple archetypical scenarios which can be used for building statistical forecasting models of deregulated electricity prices .",
    "the revealed scenarios describe universal tendencies of price movements which can be manifested in a different form depending on the time scale of interest and the level of market deregulation .",
    "the presence of negative correlations in the electricity price increments also suggests that they could be simulated by a properly chosen mean - reversion stochastic model .",
    "the simplest such model can be derived from the ornstein - uhlenbeck process which combines the standard brownian motion with the mean - reverting mechanism describing the tendency of the price to drift towards a long - term mean supported by fundamentals ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more complex mean reversion models , such as the mean reverting jump diffusion model @xcite , take into account sudden price spikes characteristic of deregulated electricity markets . in subsequent studies , the scenarios of price movements identified here could be used for adjusting numerical parameters of such models ( the mean - reversion level and rate , the volatility of the diffusion component , the frequency of the jumps etc . ) as well as for elaborating the probabilistic structure of its stochastic constituents in accordance with the non - efficient behavior of electricity prices in specific markets .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 does not reach 1.5 at any given time scale suggests that the classical brownian walk approach is not suitable for reproducing the diffusion component of the electricity price movements , and more complex stochastic drivers such as those proposed in the fractal market hypothesis @xcite would be more realistic .",
    "the stability of the mean values of the deregulated electricity prices found in our work can be viewed as a new example of statistically stable fractal markets @xcite .    in practical terms",
    ", these future theoretical efforts would provide an opportunity to reduce commodity and other financial risks associated with stochastic dynamics of electricity prices at different time scales using data - derived forecasting models .",
    "the presented methods provide new relevant information for managing equity derivatives risks over time frames exceeding one day .",
    "successful development of this segment of the stock market can make a significant contribution to further liberalization process and strengthen the informational efficiency of the electricity market as well as the stability of the industry in general .",
