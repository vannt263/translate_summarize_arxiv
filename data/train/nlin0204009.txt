    "magnetic fluids ( mfs ) are superparamagnetic fluids formed by a stable colloidal suspension of ferrimagnetic nanoparticles dispersed in a carrier liquid @xcite . the behaviour of mfs is characterized by the complex interaction of their hydrodynamic and magnetic properties with external forces . for the phenomenon of thermomagnetic convection",
    "these forces are a temperature gradient and a magnetic field .",
    "most studies consider the geometry of a horizontal layer which is simultaneously subjected to a vertical temperature gradient and either to a constant vertical magnetic field @xcite or to a vertical magnetic field with a constant gradient @xcite .",
    "studies for a cylindrical geometry are few @xcite and focus on the thermomagnetic convection under microgravity @xcite",
    ".    the present analysis of thermomagnetic convection in a cylindrical geometry is motivated by a recently observed novel convective instability . in @xcite a horizontal layer of mf between two glass plates is locally heated by a focused laser beam .",
    "it passes perpendicularly through the layer in the presence of a homogeneous vertical magnetic field .",
    "the absorption of the light by the fluid generates a temperature gradient and subsequently a refractive index gradient .",
    "this gradient is optically equivalent to a diverging lens , leading to an enhancement of the beam divergence . as result ,",
    "a stationary diffraction pattern of concentric rings is observed for zero magnetic field . above a certain threshold of the magnetic field ,",
    "the circular rings are replaced by polygonally shaped patterns which switch among different shapes alternatively . based on _ numerics",
    "_ it was stated that the characteristic time scales for mass and thermal diffusion are equal @xcite . thus thermal conduction and thermal diffusion contribute equally to the formation of the diverging lens .",
    "the polygonally shaped diffraction patterns were interpreted as ` fingerprints ' of vertical convection columns @xcite .",
    "both claims are controversial due to the following reasons .",
    "an analysis of the _ physical quantities _ reveals that both characteristic time scales are several orders of magnitude apart ( below and @xcite ) .",
    "direct spatial temperature measurements @xcite and independent measurements of all relevant material parameters for organic dispersions @xcite showed that the ring pattern is essentially caused by the temperature contribution and not by the concentration contribution .",
    "the determination of the relevant time scales confirmed that the experiment is dominated by the characteristic time for convection .",
    "presently there is no sound theoretical description for the dependence of the size of the outmost of the concentric rings on the laser power ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "a major hindrance of the studied system in @xcite is that it is almost impossible to gain information about the spatial distribution of temperature and concentration inside the mf layer . due to the lack of sound internal information",
    "many hypotheses can be brought forward to explain the experimental results . among them",
    "is the recent discussion whether the shape instability of a hot nonmagnetic bubble surrounded by mf can be accounted for the observed phenomena @xcite .",
    "this situation motivates the present work in which a model system is studied which reflects the essentials of the experimental setup .",
    "these are the axis - symmetry of the heating and the finite hight and width of the layer .",
    "the aim is to determine the necessary conditions and the critical magnetic inductions for the appearance of axial convection columns .",
    "thus the focus is on the general requirements for thermomagnetic convection in an axis - symmetric heated system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the system and the relevant equations of the problem as well as the condition for a potentially unstable stratification in the fluid are displayed in the next section . based on a linear stability analysis ( sec .",

    "the outer cylinder has the radius @xmath9 , where in the region @xmath10 the constant temperature @xmath11 and constant susceptibility @xmath12 is present .",

    "the susceptibility of the mf is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the susceptibility according to langevins theory which assumes non - interacting particles .",
    "higher order terms in @xmath17 are included in order to determine the magnetic ( or kelvin ) force density beyond the dilute limit @xmath18 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 was determined in different microscopic models @xcite which all provide the same value @xmath20 . the demagnetization factor",
    "@xmath21 accounts for the finite size of the composite cylinder and is a function of the heigh - to - diameter ratio @xmath22 and the effective susceptibility @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the kelvin force follows then as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25\\right\\}\\over ( 1+n\\chi)^3}\\ ; .\\ ] ]    considering mfs as binary mixtures , it is necessary to evaluate the influence of temperature and concentration on pattern phenomena by analyzing the corresponding time scales .",
    "these are the characteristic time for convection @xmath26 and for mass diffusion @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the typical length for convection ( diffusion ) , @xmath30 the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath31 the mass diffusion coefficient . using the data given in @xcite ,",

    "both length scales are equal to the gap width @xmath5 , diffusion phenomena can be neglected .",
    "the system is governed by the equation of continuity , the navier - stokes equations , and the equation of heat conduction for the mf which are in nondimensional form @xmath37 where the prandtl number @xmath38 characterizes the fluid and the magnetization number @xmath39 tunes the external excitation . denoting @xmath40 as kinematic viscosity",

    "rigid boundary conditions are assumed for the velocity at the inner and outer radius of the gap , @xmath51 at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where the radii ratio is given by @xmath54 .",
    "the temperature is assumed to be constant at each boundary , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    since the kelvin force is the only destabilizing force present in the system",
    ", one has to determine which profile leads to a potentially unstable stratification in the fluid . for heating at the inner radius ,",
    "the required profile is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) : the @xmath57-component of the kelvin force density has to act inwards and its absolute value increases monotonically outward .",
    "with such a profile a fluid volume at the distance @xmath58 ( solid rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) experiences a larger force towards the center compared to a fluid volume at the distance @xmath57 ( dashed rectangle ) . moving the latter fluid volume from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ( dot - dashed rectangle ) results in an effective force which points in the direction of the displacement ( indicated symbolically by the subtraction of the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) bottom ) .",
    "this force may enhance small displacements of warmer fluid volumes towards cooler regions and thus making the stratification potentially unstable .",
    "the above argument has to be tested for the quiescent conductive state which is given by @xmath59 and @xmath60/\\ln\\eta$ ] . applying the condition for a destabilizing force profile to the @xmath57-component of the kelvin force density in eq .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is taken from the data given in @xcite .",
    "decreasing the temperature difference from @xmath113 k to @xmath114 k causes a dramatic increase in the critical induction of nearly three orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "with decreasing temperature difference the critical radii ratio grows , i.e. the allowed gap becomes more narrow . since the convection rolls prefer the same length scale in @xmath57 and @xmath50-direction , much more rolls have to be driven in a very small gap .",
    "the energy for this effort comes from the external induction which is why it amplifies drastically for small @xmath115 ( fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .    whereas the critical azimuthal wave number @xmath107 is independent of @xmath116 and @xmath21 ( fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) , the critical induction varies . first the two thresholds for the case of an infinitely extended layer , @xmath109 , are compared . the inclusion of a quadratic term in the susceptibility with @xmath20 results in a lower threshold for the onset of convection than in the dilute case @xmath108 ( solid and long - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the difference between the thresholds is nearly the same value , @xmath117 , for all tested temperatures @xmath118 k @xmath119 @xmath120 k.    now the thresholds for the case of a finite layer with @xmath111 cm are compared .",
    "contrary to the previous case , the threshold for a dilute fluid ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) is lower than for a nondilute fluid ( dotted line ) .",
    "again the difference is almost constant over the entire temperature range , @xmath121 \\simeq 1.18 b_c [ \\beta_1\\!\\!=\\!\\!0 , n(\\gamma\\!\\!=\\!\\!0.15,\\chi_{{\\rm eff}})]$ ] .",
    "the relation of the different thresholds is caused by the value of @xmath122 for the given combinations of @xmath21 , @xmath19 , and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath122 can be considered as a measure for the strength of the magnetic force in the gap : as higher the value of @xmath122 as lower the critical external induction necessary to trigger the convection .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the value of @xmath122 for the four considered parameter sets . at @xmath100 the relation @xmath123 ( see cross - sections of the long - dashed and the solid line with the vertical solid line ) is the reason that the threshold for the dilute fluid is higher than for the nondilute fluid . the opposite relation @xmath124 >",
    "f_{\\chi_l}[\\beta_1\\!\\!=\\!\\!1/3,n(\\gamma\\!\\!=\\!\\!0.15,\\chi_{{\\rm eff}})]$ ] ( see cross - sections of the dot - dashed and the dotted line with the vertical solid line ) causes the opposite relation for the thresholds in the case of a finite layer .",
    "the physical reasons which cause theses differences are the following .",
    "the kelvin force is proportional to the magnetization in the magnetic fluid .",
    "thus as higher the magnetization is , as lower the external induction can be in order to generate the same strength of the magnetic force . in the infinite case , where @xmath110 is independent of @xmath7 , a higher concentration of magnetic particles in the fluid leads to a higher magnetization and therefore to a lower threshold . in the finite case ,",
    "the demagnetization factor depends on @xmath7 @xcite and is smaller for higher concentrations of magnetic particles than for lower concentrations .",
    "a higher demagnetization factor means a lower inner field and a higher magnetization , respectively .",
    "therefore in the finite case an increase in the concentration results in two counteracting effects with respect to the magnetization . in the studied example of @xmath100",
    "the influence of the demagnetization effect wins : the dilute fluid has the lower threshold .",
    "but for @xmath125 the direct influence of the concentration succeeds over the demagnetization effect .",
    "the nondilute fluid has the lower threshold ( the dotted line is then above the dot - dashed line , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .    in the infinite and finite case",
    "the clear and measurable difference between the thresholds opens a very good opportunity to decide whether a test sample is a dilute fluid or not . just by measuring the threshold for the onset of convection in the proposed model system",
    "the answer can be given .",
    "the critical induction depends on the fluid and system parameters as @xmath126 . by choosing fluids with low ( high ) density and thermal conductivity and a large ( small ) radius @xmath4 ,",
    "the threshold can be lowered ( raised ) corresponding to the experimentally available magnetic fields .    the major obstacle in order to compare the results with the experimental data in @xcite is the lack of an experimentally determined spatial profile of the temperature inside the sample .",
    "therefore it is not possible to extract an estimation what might be the values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 in the experiment .",
    "nevertheless the calculated values indicate that really high critical external inductions are necessary to trigger vertical convections rolls by a _ pure radial _ temperature gradient .",
    "the threshold for the induction reaches extremely high values if one extrapolates towards radii in the range of hundreds of micrometers , not unlikely due to the focused laser beam used in the experiment @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that vertical convections rolls due to a pure radial temperature gradient are unlikely to account for the observed phenomena of polygonally shaped diffraction patterns .    due to the lack of information from inside the sample , it is not clear whether the temperature profile in the experimental sample is purely radial .",
    "there are hints in @xcite that due to the absorption along the way of the laser beam a vertical temperature distribution exists as well .",
    "a further cause for an axial temperature gradient is the heat loss through the glass plates by which the mf layer is sandwiched .",
    "if such a vertical temperature gradient comes into play , concentration gradients due to the soret effect may become important .",
    "the relative influence of temperature and concentration gradients is strongly effected by the relation of the characteristic times @xmath127 and @xmath128 which depend quadratically on the lengths @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . with a radial and a vertical temperature gradient present , it becomes even more important to have reliable data of the internal profiles to estimate these lengths .",
    "two differences between the model and the motivating experiment should be noted .",
    "the constant temperature @xmath2 for the inner cylinder is not given in the experiment .",
    "how much the temperature varies in this inner area is not known .",
    "the numerical calculations in @xcite suggest a difference of about @xmath129 k. the thresholds were calculated for rigid boundaries whereas in the experiment the fluid layer boundary is free . for thermal convection in a rotating layer of magnetic fluid the influence of rigid and free boundaries on the threshold was studied in @xcite . considering the case of zero rotation ,",
    "the thresholds differ by not more than @xmath130% ( see figs .  3 and 4 in @xcite for rotation number @xmath131 ) .",
    "with respect to the above mentioned major obstacle , these differences may alter the results only marginally .",
    "a model system of a composite cylinder of finite size with axis - symmetrical temperature distribution is presented . using the kelvin force density  ( [ eq:2],[eq:3 ] )",
    "a general condition  ( [ eq:7 ] ) is derived for which a potentially unstable stratification exists if the inner cylinder is heated .",
    "depending on the temperature difference , the size of the composite cylinder and the dilute or nondilute character of the magnetic fluid , the critical gap sizes are calculated .",
    "the general result is that only in a narrow gap the requirement for a potentially unstable stratification is met . exploiting this property , a linear stability analysis",
    "is performed in order to determine the critical external induction for the onset of thermomagnetic convection . with decreasing temperature difference , the critical induction increases dramatically .",
    "the reason is that for smaller temperature differences which demand smaller gaps in order to fulfil condition  ( [ eq:7 ] ) , much more convection rolls have to be driven .",
    "the driving of these many rolls causes the drastic increasing of the critical induction .",
    "the distinct difference between the threshold for dilute and nondilute magnetic fluids allows to use the considered system for an experimental determination whether a test fluid is a dilute or nondilute one .",
    "the rather high external induction , needed to stimulate the convection flow , leads to the conclusion that vertical convections rolls due to a pure radial temperature gradient are unlikely to account for the observed diffraction patterns .",
    "the consideration of a vertical temperature gradient entails that concentration gradients may become relevant . to answer this question",
    "the characteristic time for the diffusion with respect to whose for convection has to be re - estimated . because they will not be necessarily apart by orders of magnitude as in the case of a pure radial temperature gradient .",
    "also different convection patterns can be expected with the presence of a vertical temperature gradient . in order to come to a correct statement about the contribution of mass and thermal diffusion to the diffraction patterns in magnetic fluids , spatial temperature measurements and independent measurements of all relevant material parameters as in @xcite for an organic dispersion are highly desirable .",
