    "in classical data transmission , repeaters are used to amplify data signals ( bits ) when they become weaker during their propagation through the transmission channel .",
    "in contrast to classical information , the above mechanism is impossible to realize when the transmitted data signals are the carriers of quantum information ( qubits ) , which can not be amplified or cloned without destroying the encoded information @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , the carrier has to propagate along the entire length of the transmission channel which , due to various losses , leads to an exponentially decreasing probability to receive it intact at the end of the channel .    to circumvent this problem ,",
    "the quantum repeater was proposed in the seminal ref .",
    "@xcite that encapsulates three building blocks ( i ) entanglement distribution , ( ii ) entanglement purification , and ( iii ) entanglement swapping , which have to be applied sequentially . using the first building block , a large set of low - fidelity entangled qubit pairs",
    "is generated between all repeater nodes , which becomes distilled by the second block into a smaller set of high - fidelity entangled pairs .",
    "entanglement swapping , finally , combines two purified entangled pairs distributed between the neighboring repeater nodes into one entangled pair leading to a gradually increasing distance of shared entanglement .",
    "obviously , quantum repeater schemes are not straightforward .",
    "the above mentioned building blocks , for instance , require a feasible and reliable quantum logic , while low - fidelity entangled pairs have to be distributed over reasonably long distances . up to now , only a few schemes , which distribute entanglement over the distance of 200 km using fiber - optic @xcite and 100 km using free - space channel @xcite between the nodes have been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "nevertheless , motivated by a rapidly growing experimental and theoretical progress in the field of quantum communication , various quantum repeater schemes and single building blocks have been proposed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we already proposed a dynamical quantum repeater scheme in which the entanglement between the two neighboring repeater nodes was distributed using controlled displacements of input coherent light , while the generated low - fidelity entangled pairs were purified using ancillary ( four - partite ) entangled states .",
    "this scheme exploited solely the evolution of short chains of atoms coupled to optical cavities located in each repeater node , such that any explicit usage of quantum logical gates has been avoided . in the present paper",
    ", we propose an improved quantum repeater scheme that ( as well ) avoids two - qubit quantum logical gates and where the entanglement is distributed using a sequence of controlled phase shifts and displacements of input coherent light , while entanglement purification is free of ancillary entangled resources .",
    "this repeater scheme exhibits reasonable fidelities and repeater rates providing an attractive platform for long - distance quantum communication .",
    "in particular , our entanglement distribution becomes very efficient , simple , and practical , as it only requires discriminating two optical coherent states with opposite signs , where each allows for conditionally preparing a certain two - qubit bell state over the distance in two neighboring repeater nodes .",
    "this way , in the ideal loss - free case , maximum two - qubit entanglement can be deterministically generated with unit fidelity in the limit of large coherent - state amplitudes .",
    "note that in the present work we focus on a standard ( original ) quantum repeater scheme as described above and based on the use of quantum memories and two - way classical communication .",
    "other more recent approaches that make use of quantum error correction codes reduce or completely eliminate the need for storing quantum information and for employing two - way communication . as a result ,",
