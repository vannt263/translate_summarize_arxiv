    "one of the major obstacles in building an efficient quantum computer is the presence of errors introduced by the environment . for over twenty years",
    ", different methods have been developed aiming to protect the quantum information , such as quantum error - correction codes @xcite , decoherence - free subspaces or subsystems @xcite and dynamical decoupling @xcite . among these strategies , the dynamical decoupling has the advantage of not requiring the use of extra qubits to encode the logical qubits , actively protecting quantum information by means of a sequence of ultrafast pulses or high frequency fields .",
    "quantum entanglement has been considered one of the main concepts concerning the measurement of quantum correlations .",
    "however , several alternative measures of quantum correlations have drawn considerable attention in the last few years . among these plethora of new correlation measurements",
    "@xcite , quantum discord @xcite has been one of the most employed .",
    "quantum discord ( qd ) is intimately connected to the entanglement of formation @xcite , the conditional entropy @xcite and the mutual information . moreover ,",
    "quantum discord is related to many important protocols as the distribution of entanglement @xcite , quantum locking @xcite , entanglement irreversibility @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
    "for some specific initial conditions @xcite , qd has the property of not being affected by the environment during an initial finite time .",
    "such a finite time is known as _ transition time _ because it delimits a sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence regime .",
    "recently , luo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility of extending the _ transition time _ by means of a dynamical decoupling ( dd ) technique that uses bang - bang pulses to control the decoherence of two qubits coupled to independent spin baths .",
    "their results demonstrated that the _ transition time _ can indeed be extended by this kind of protection . in the present work ,",
    "we theoretically investigate the protection of the qd through the application of a different type of dd technique that uses continuous fields , which is a more realistic scheme than using instantaneous pulses @xcite .",
    "the interest of the scientific community has been increasing for this kind of protection and very recently it has been experimentally implemented to protect the quantum information in nitrogen vacancy systems @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that using this kind of protection , the coherence time can be prolonged about twenty times @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be applied to a wide variety of physical systems including trapped atoms and ions , quantum dots and nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond .    in order to probe the protection method",
    ", we solve the redfield master equation taking into account the interaction of each qubit with their own boson bath .",
    "we study the effects caused by temperature and two kinds of initial conditions : pure and mixed states .",
    "we show that protecting qd by means of dd technique can be tricky depending on the initial condition of the system and on the timescale required to preserve qd .",
    "contrarily to entanglement and fidelity , the protection of quantum discord by means of dd is not efficient for some initial states with special symmetries before the _ transition time_. however , if one is interested in the long - term behavior of qd , then the dd protective scheme should be considered and the control field should be turned on well before the _ transition time_. such a result is very different from the one obtained through instantaneous pulses approach @xcite .",
    "this difference occurs because instantaneous pulses applied to the system do not break the symmetry of the reduced density matrix , which is an essential ingredient to keep qd intact before the _ transition time _ @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a continuous field applied to the system induces a dynamics that breaks the symmetry of the reduced density matrix , thereby inhibiting the sudden transition .",
    "the hamiltonian for a two - qubit system and the environment can be written as    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the environment - free hamiltonian , which includes the qubits hamiltonian and the time - dependent fields applied to protect the quantum discord .",
    "@xmath2 is the hamiltonian describing the environment and the hamiltonian @xmath3 takes into account the interaction between the qubits and the environment . here , @xmath4 represents two independent baths of harmonic oscillators ( one for each qubit ) with @xmath5 given by the frequency of the @xmath6th normal mode of the thermal bath and @xmath7 @xmath8 is the usual annihilator ( creator ) operator for the @xmath9th qubit , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the operator that annihilates ( creates ) a bath quantum in the @xmath6th mode of the @xmath9th qubit .",
    "we used units of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) .",
    "henceforth , we adopt this convention .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath3 describing two qubits coupled to their baths is written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , are operators that act on the environmental hilbert space .",
    "@xmath16 are the pauli @xmath17 matrix acting on @xmath9th qubit .",
    "this model is called a dephasing noise and it is a typical class of errors in quantum dots @xcite and josephson junction @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a complex coupling constant for @xmath6th normal mode with frequency dimension .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume there exist a global , static control field that exactly cancels the intrinsic system hamiltonian , _ i.e. _ , @xmath21 represents only the active protection and it is given by a continuous applied field defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the period of @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is an integer number .",
    "the general prescription of the dynamical decoupling @xcite is based on finding a controlled unitary operation such that @xmath27 this is a sufficient condition to shield the effect of the environment over the system and , as exposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , perfect shielding can be reached when @xmath26 tends to infinity .",

    "since each qubit is subjected to identical environments , the @xmath9 index of @xmath20 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 can be omitted .",

    "in this section , we present the definition of three distinct measures for quantum systems .      to calculate the dissipative dynamics fidelity , we use an alternative measure known in the literature as _ superfidelity _ @xcite .",

    ", the concurrence , fidelity , and quantum discord presents a similar behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ , as the amplitude of the protective field increases , the protection of the quantum information is enhanced @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , despite the restrictive initial state , the protection of fidelity , concurrence , and quantum discord is reached for all pure initial states qualitatively in the same way , that is , the higher the amplitude of the protective field , the better the protection . as shown in the following",
    ", the quantum discord does not necessarily behaves in the same qualitative way as fidelity and concurrence with respect to the application of the protective field for mixed states .",
    "consider as initial condition a mixed state given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) shows the dynamics of qd as function of time , considering @xmath96 .",
    "one can notice that similarly to the pure initial state case , the control field is efficient in protecting qd . in brief , the protection protocol has the same efficiency for the initial state @xmath97 as the one found for pure initial states .",
    "such a characteristic is also observed for the great majority of initial mixed - states .     and @xmath61k .",
    "( a ) the solid ( black ) line gives the concurrence when the control field is turned off and the dotted ( red ) , double dot - dashed ( blue ) , and dot - dashed ( green ) lines give the concurrence when the control fields are turned on at @xmath85 , using @xmath86 respectively .",

    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we show the concurrence and the fidelity dynamics for some frequencies of the protective field .",
    "there is no qualitative difference involving the protection of the concurrence and the fidelity : the greater the amplitude of the protective field , the better the protection .",
    "nevertheless , we observe a different behavior when dealing with the quantum discord .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) , it can be noticed an abrupt decrease , the sudden transition , in the quantum discord around @xmath101 for the non - protected case .",
    "up to this sudden transition , the results obtained with the protection turned on at @xmath85 are less efficient in maintaining the quantum discord than with the protection turned off .",
    "actually , for @xmath102 , the protective dynamics is equivalent to the non - protected one only in the limit that @xmath26 goes to infinity .",
    "however , there is a finite time when the protected quantum discord surpass that of the non - protected case , given by the crossing of the dotted lines with the solid line in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the effectiveness of the protective field only occurs above these times @xmath103 , which are greater than the time of sudden transition of the quantum discord @xmath104 .",
    "thus , for this particular initial condition , the timescale needed to protect qd should be determinant to decide for the use of the dd protective scheme .     and @xmath61k .",
    "the solid ( black ) line gives the quantum discord when the control field is turned off and the closed points ( magenta ) , dotted ( red ) , double dot - dashed ( blue ) , and dot - dashed ( green ) lines give the quantum discord when the control fields are turned on at @xmath85 , using @xmath105 respectively . in the inset",
    "we plot the time for efficiency as a function of @xmath26 . ]",
    "this peculiar aspect involving the protection of the quantum discord occurs because the plateau given in the free evolution exist for some special symmetries of the initial state @xcite .",
    "the dynamical decoupling strategy is an active method of protection and needs to continuously modify the density matrix during the dynamics . on the other hand",
    ", the density matrix reaches its original and special symmetry just at some periodic times .",
    "these unavoidable density matrix modifications involving the protection by means of dd decreases the quantum discord , which reaches a lower value than the initial one .",
    "however , when the quantum discord dynamics reaches the sudden transition time , it starts to decrease , while the protective scheme becomes efficient .",
    "it is important to emphasize the difference between our results and the ones obtained by the dd technique that employs instantaneous pulses @xcite .",
    "if each pulse is considered to be applied instantaneously , the changes imposed to the system by this kind of pulses never alter the x structure of the initial reduced density matrix .",
    "therefore , the sharp transition in the quantum discord is preserved , whereas the continuous decoupling technique presented here leads to a more gradual decay .",
    "based on the above results , one could be led to conclude that if the initial state has a special symmetry such that the qd presents a plateau for the free evolution of the system , then the best strategy would be to turn on the protective field only after the sudden transition time . however , as we show in the following , this may not be the best strategy .",
    "figure  ( [ fignew ] ) presents the evolution of the qd for the protective field turned on at different moments .",
    "the dashed curves probe the situation with the protective field turned on at @xmath85 , while the solid curves probe the dynamics for a control field turned on at @xmath101 .",
    "it is clearly seen that if one intends to enhance the protection of qd in the long - term , one should turn on the protective field at @xmath85 and not wait until the sudden transition .     and @xmath61k .",
    "the solid ( black ) lines give the quantum discord when the control field is turned on at @xmath101 , while the dashed ( red ) curves correspond to the qd when the control fields is turned on at @xmath85 .",
    "we probe both situations by using @xmath106 in ( a ) , @xmath107 in ( b ) , @xmath108 in ( c ) , and @xmath109 in ( d ) . ]",
    "it is interesting to analyze the case of protection for completely unknown states , where an initial state is chosen randomly . in this case",
    ", the density matrix will most likely never reach the necessary structure to result in a frozen discord @xcite .",
    "thus , considering the long term evolution , the best strategy is to turn on the protection at @xmath85 .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that a state that presents a plateau in the qd is a mixture of bell states .",
    "these states are a very important class of states and are used in many problems in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental realization of these states has been observed in the context of quantum optics experiments @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite as well as in solid state physics @xcite .    .",
    "]    we now consider how a finite temperature environment influences the scenario of qd protection .",
    "the first relevant observation involving finite temperature environments is that the interaction with the environment becomes more deleterious . in fig .",
    "( [ figtemp ] ) , we study the temperature effects on the protection method . we take @xmath110 and present the time for effectiveness of the protective field as a function of the temperature .",
    "as one can observe , @xmath111 decreases when the temperature is increased .",
    "therefore , for higher temperatures , the protective scheme becomes efficient sooner .",
    "this characteristic occurs because when the temperature increases , the density matrix coherence decays faster and , consequently , the time of sudden transition is reduced .",
    "thus , the plateau of quantum discord is smaller and the effectiveness of the protective scheme is achieved sooner .",
    "we note that for @xmath112k the time for efficiency approaches @xmath113 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the protection of qd from errors introduced by the environment by means of dd with continuous fields .",
    "we have compared two kinds of initial condition , pure and mixed states and also included finite temperature effects .",
    "it has been shown that , in contrast with fidelity and concurrence , the effectiveness of the protective scheme depends on the initial state and on the timescale required to protect qd . for initial states with a particular symmetry such that the qd presents a plateau in the free evolution of the system , one should not turn on the protective field if the timescale of interest is below the _ transition time_. however , if one is interested in the long term evolution of qd , the protective field should be turned on well before the _ transition time_. finally , we have verified that for these particular initial states , the greater the temperature , the faster the efficiency of the protective method is achieved , which evidences the relevance of the temperature in the protection of qd .",

    "<S> this work investigates the use of dynamical decoupling to shield quantum discord from errors introduced by the environment . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , a two - qubits system interacting with independent baths of bosons is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions of the system were chosen as pure and mixed states , while the dynamical decoupling has been achieved by means of continuous fields . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the temperature on the shielding of quantum discord is also studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that although the quantum discord for particular initial states may be perfectly preserved over some finite time window in the absence of any protective field , the effectiveness of the dynamical decoupling with continuous fields depends essentially on the timescale required to preserve quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that for these particular initial states the time for which the shielding of the quantum discord becomes effective decreases as the temperature increases . </S>"
