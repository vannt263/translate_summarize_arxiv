    "our proposed mechanism should apply .",
    "although we do not know of any systematic study of dicretized field theories in higher dimensions , a plausibility argument can be made that yang - mills fields exhibit chaos in ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions .",

    "one time dimension is effectively eliminated by gauge fixing .    in the absence of similar explicit constraints , field theories with two timelike dimensions ,",

    "conservation of the energy - momentum vector ensures that the total energy component orthogonal to @xmath175 always remains zero .",

    "whether this process leads to an effective quantum field theory in the @xmath161-dimensional minkowski space , remains to be investigated .",
    "finally , what about gravity ?",
    "one reason , why this question is difficult to answer , is that little is known about the properties of general relativity as a dynamical system . due to its different gauge group structure , gravity has more `` capacity to resist '' chaos than the yang - mills fields .",
    "local invariance against coordinate transformations is incompatible with the concept of hamiltonian dynamics , which has a preferred time direction .",
    "the hamiltonian version of general relativity @xcite used in cosmology ( mixmaster universe ) reflects this exceptional situation in gr .",
    "even the most basic definitions of deterministic chaos are not directly applicable to general relativity and require appropriate generalizations .",
    "many special , chaotic solutions of einstein s equations have been found @xcite .",
    "most important among these is the eternally oscillating chaotic behavior discovered in @xcite for the generic solution of the vacuum einstein equations in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity , which has the character of deterministic chaos .",
    "however , it is not known whether the generic solution exhibits chaos , as in the case of the yang - mills theory .",
    "it is not even clear what the proper framework for a systematic numerical study of this question would be .",
    "for example , the lyapunov exponents , which were so effectively used in yang - mills theory , are coordinate dependent in gr due to the general covariance of einstein s equations against coordinate transformations .",
    "what is clear , is that general relativity shares many of the properties , which allow nonabelian gauge theories to chaotically quantize themselves : einstein s equations are strongly nonlinear and have a large set of gauge invariances which could guarantee the survival of a dynamical sector at long distances in the presence of quasi - thermal noise . under such conditions",
    ", gr may not even require a short - distance cutoff , because the thermal schwarzschild radius @xmath177 defines an effective limit to short - distance dynamics which can couple to the dynamics at large distance scales . applying the relation ( [ eq48 ] ) determining @xmath178 for the yang - mills field",
