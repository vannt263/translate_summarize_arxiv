    "the formation of naked singularities in various collapse models is a well known occurance ; examples include the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) and kerr spacetimes @xcite , certain models of critical collapse @xcite and certain self - similar perfect fluid and dust solutions @xcite . in response to the formation of such singularities ,",
    "roger penrose proposed that the evolution of physically reasonable and generic initial data will not result in the formation of a naked singularity , a statement known as the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is noted that many spacetimes which contain naked singularities also show high degrees of symmetry and it is tempting to conclude that the formation of the naked singularity is ( in some cases ) due to the unphysical symmetry of the spacetime .",
    "it follows that one manner in which the cch can be studied is by disturbing the symmetry of a naked singularity spacetime by introducing perturbations .",
    "should these perturbations remain finite as they evolve through the spacetime , then the singularity has displayed stability to such perturbations . in particular",
    ", the behaviour of perturbations on the cauchy horizon ( ch ) of the rn spacetime is illustrative .",
    "recall that the ch is the first null ray emitted by the singularity ; it can equally be thought of as the boundary which separates observers who can see the singularity from those who can not . in rn ,",
    "the ch is a hypersurface on which perturbations diverge .",
    "more precisely , metric perturbations which arrive at the ch from the exterior have an infinite flux on the ch , as measured by observers crossing the ch .",
    "one might expect that perturbations evolving through other spacetimes containing naked singularities would show similar divergent behaviour on the ch .",
    "should the perturbations turn out to behave in a finite manner on the ch , in certain cases one can still rule out the spacetime as a serious counter - example to the cch . in some cases , the spacetime involves an unrealistic matter model , for example the vaidya spacetime containing null dust or the perfect fluid spacetime , which neglects shear , viscosity and heat conduction .",
    "another phenomenon which sometimes occurs is that the formation of the naked singularity depends on specific initial data ; any perturbation of the initial data and the naked singularity fails to form @xcite .",
    "we consider here the behaviour of even parity perturbations of the self - similar lematre - tolman - bondi spacetime .",
    "we note that this spacetime can not be taken as a serious counter - example to the cch , as the first of the above - mentioned defects is present in this spacetime .",
    "the matter model used is a dust cloud which ignores pressure ( and pressure gradients ) , and therefore does not provide a realistic description of gravitational collapse .",
    "nonetheless , the simplicity of this spacetime makes it a very useful toy model for gravitational collapse resulting in naked singularity formation .",
    "for example , in the present paper we develop techniques that should in principle be applicable to any spherically symmetric self - similar spacetime .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the behaviour of odd parity perturbations of the self - similar ltb spacetime was considered .",
    "these perturbations were found to remain finite at the ch , where finiteness is measured with respect to certain energy norms of the perturbation , and pointwise values thereof .",
    "this result holds for a general choice of initial data and initial data surface . in this paper , we use broadly similar techniques , with non - trivial extensions , to examine the behaviour of even parity perturbations of the same spacetime .",
    "the question of the behaviour of even parity perturbations of this spacetime was considered by nolan and waters @xcite . in this work ,",
    "both a harmonic decomposition and a fourier mode decomposition of the gauge invariant perturbation variables and equations were used , and the individual fourier modes @xmath1 were analysed .",
    "it was found that modes which are finite on the past null cone remain finite on the cauchy horizon .",
    "however , the question of how to resum these modes on the cauchy horizon was not fully addressed and so the problem of getting a complete analytic understanding the even parity linear perturbations remains unresolved .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the structure of the self - similar ltb spacetime and examine conditions necessary for this spacetime to have a naked singularity . in section [ sec : gs ] , we discuss the perturbation formalism due to gerlach and sengupta .",
    "this formalism uses a multipole decomposition to write linear metric and matter perturbations in terms of functions depending on the similarity coordinate @xmath2 and the comoving radial coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "these perturbations do not share the background symmetries of self - similarity and spherical symmetry . in section [ sec : reduction ]",
    "we derive a fundamental four - dimensional system of coupled linear pdes which describe the evolution of the even parity perturbations .    in practice , we work with a five dimensional system , which has the very useful property of symmetric hyperbolicity .",
    "these five variables obey an equation of motion arising from the linearised einstein equations and must also satisify a constraint , the elimination of which produces the four variable system . having determined a useful form for the perturbation variables and the einstein equations , we aim to examine the behaviour of the perturbations as they reach the ch .",
    "in particular , we wish to know whether or not the perturbations remain finite there .",
    "our strategy in addressing this problem is as follows . in section [ sec : reduction ] , we find that the perturbations obey a pde whose coefficients , as a consequence of the self - similarity , depend only on the similarity coordinate .",
    "this means that we can take the state vector @xmath4 which describes the perturbations and integrate with respect to the radius , to produce a kind of `` average '' .",
    "since the ch is a surface of constant similarity variable , and since the equations of motion have coefficients independent of the radius , we can reasonably expect that the behaviour of this averaged perturbation should reflect the behaviour of the perturbation itself .",
    "in other words , we use the behaviour of solutions to the averaged perturbation s equation of motion as a guide to the behaviour of the perturbation itself .",
    "this is the core strategy behind this work .    in section",
    "[ sec : lqblowup ] we analyse the behaviour of solutions to the ode which this averaged form satisfies , as they approach the ch . this ode has a regular singular point , and methods for solving such systems are well understood .",
    "we can show that solutions to this system generically blow - up on the ch , with a characteristic power given by an eigenvalue of a particular matrix , which we denote @xmath5 .",
    "however , since this result applies only to an average of @xmath4 , we can not immediately conclude that @xmath4 blows - up at the ch in a pointwise manner .    in section [ sec : chdivbehaviour ]",
    ", we investigate the pointwise behaviour of @xmath4 by introducing a new state vector @xmath6 , related to @xmath4 , which we expect to have a finite limit on the ch .",
    "we devote the next section to a series of results , which cumulatively show that @xmath6 is finite and non - zero on the ch .",
    "this in turn establishes that @xmath4 blows - up in a pointwise manner on the ch .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : gi ] we use the perturbed weyl scalars to give a physical interpretation of our result . in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] we make some concluding remarks and discuss further developments of this work .",
    "we use units in which @xmath7 .",
    "the lematre - tolman - bondi spacetime is a spherically symmetric spacetime containing a pressure - free perfect fluid which undergoes an inhomogeneous collapse into a singularity . under certain conditions",
    "this singularity can be naked .",
    "we will initially use comoving coordinates @xmath8 , in which the radius @xmath3 labels each successive shell in the collapsing dust .",
    "the line element for such a spacetime can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the physical radius of the dust .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of the dust can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the 4-velocity of the dust and @xmath14 is its rest mass density . in comoving coordinates , @xmath15 .",
    "the background einstein equations for the metric and stress energy in comoving coordinates immediately provide the following results , @xmath16 @xmath17 the function @xmath18 is known as the misner - sharp mass and is a suitable mass measure for spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "recall that a shell focusing singularity is a singularity which occurs when the physical radius @xmath11 of the dust cloud decreases to zero , so that all the matter shells have been `` focused '' onto a single point . in this spacetime ,",
    "a shell focusing singularity occurs on a surface of the form @xmath19 , which includes the scaling origin @xmath20 .",
    "we immediately specialise to the marginally bound case by setting @xmath21 .",
    "see @xcite for more details on the background spacetime .",
    "we follow here the conventions of @xcite",
    ". a spacetime displays self - similarity if it admits a homothetic killing vector field , that is , a vector field @xmath22 such that @xmath23 in comoving coordinates , the homothetic killing vector field is given by @xmath24 .",
    "when self - similarity is imposed on the metric and stress - energy tensor , we find that functions appearing in the metric , the dust density and the misner - sharp mass have the following scaling behaviour @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the similarity variable and @xmath28 is a constant ( the case @xmath29 corresponds to flat spacetime ) .",
    "having imposed self - similarity , we find that combining ( [ rdot ] ) , ( [ nuandr ] ) and ( [ rhoandm ] ) , produces @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the form of the line element ( [ metric_tr ] ) is invariant under the coordinate transformation @xmath32 .",
    "we choose @xmath3 so that @xmath33 and @xmath34 . with this expression for @xmath35",
    "we can solve for @xmath36 explicitly .",
    "in ( [ rhoande ] ) we convert @xmath36 to a derivative in @xmath37 and find that @xmath38 we note that by combining ( [ rhoandm ] ) with ( [ rhoande ] ) , we can find an expression for @xmath39 , @xmath40 we state the metric in @xmath37 coordinates for future use ,    @xmath41    in section [ sec : gi ] we will need the radial null directions of the self - similar ltb spacetime . in terms of @xmath37 coordinates , retarded null coordinates @xmath42 and @xmath43 take the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "in these coordinates , the metric takes the form    @xmath46    in order to calculate the perturbed weyl scalars , we will need the radially in- and outgoing null vectors , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these vectors obey the normalization @xmath49 .",
    "a suitable choice is therefore @xmath50 where @xmath51 . in what follows",
    ", we shall always use a dot to indicate differentiation with respect to the similarity variable @xmath2 , @xmath52 .",
    "we now consider the conditions required for the singularity at the scaling origin @xmath20 to be naked . as a necessary and sufficient condition for nakedness , the spacetime must admit causal curves which have their past endpoint on the singularity .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that it is actually sufficient to consider only null geodesics with their past endpoints on the singularity , and without loss of generality , we restrict our attention to the case of radial null geodesics ( rngs ) .",
    "the equation which governs rngs can be read off the metric ( [ metric_tr ] ) , @xmath53 since we wish to consider outgoing rngs we select the @xmath54 sign .",
    "we can convert the above equation into an ode in the similarity variable , @xmath55 we look for constant solutions to this equation , which correspond to null geodesics that originate from the singularity . in other words ,",
    "the existence of constant solutions to ( [ zrrngs ] ) is equivalent to the nakedness of the singularity . for constant solutions , we set the derivative of @xmath2 to zero , so that the cauchy horizon is the first root of @xmath56 where we reserve the dot notation to indicate a derivative with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath57 . by using ( [ sdef ] ) , we can write ( [ ch ] ) as an algebraic equation in @xmath2 , @xmath58 we wish to discover when this equation will have real solutions .",
    "this can easily be found using the polynomial discriminant for a quartic equation , which is negative when there are two real roots . in this case",
    "we have @xmath59 which is negative in the region @xmath60 where @xmath61 is @xmath62 this translates to the bound @xmath63 . from ( [ rhoandm ] ) , we can see that this result implies that singularities which are `` not too massive '' can be naked .",
    "see figure [ fig1 ] for a penrose diagram of this spacetime .",
    "_ in fact , one can find @xmath64 in two ranges , namely @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we reject the latter range as begin unphysical .",
    "consider ( [ sdef ] ) , which indicates that the shell - focusing singularity occurs at @xmath67 . if we chose the range @xmath68 we would find that the corresponding outgoing rng occurs after the shell focusing singularity and so is not part of the spacetime .",
    "_    _ we note that this analysis has assumed that the entire spacetime is filled with a dust fluid",
    ". a more realistic model would involve introducing a cutoff at some radius @xmath69 , after which the spacetime would be empty .",
    "we would then match the interior matter - filled region to an exterior schwarszchild spacetime .",

    "we shall use the gerlach - sengupta method @xcite to perturb this spacetime ( we follow the presentation of @xcite ) .",
    "this method exploits the spherical symmetry of the spacetime by performing a decomposition of the spacetime into two submanifolds ( with corresponding metrics ) .",
    "perturbations of the spacetime are then expanded in a multipole decomposition and gauge invariant combinations of the perturbations are constructed .",
    "we begin by writing the metric of the entire spacetime @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a lorentzian metric on the 2-dimensional manifold @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the metric for the 2-sphere @xmath78 ( and the full manifold is @xmath79 ) .",

    "we now wish to perturb the metric ( [ gsmetric ] ) , so that @xmath95 . to do this , we decompose @xmath96 and write explicitly the angular dependence using the spherical harmonics .",
    "we write the spherical harmonics as @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 forms a basis for scalar harmonics , while @xmath99 form a basis for vector harmonics .",
    "finally , @xmath100 form a basis for tensor harmonics .",
    "we can classify these harmonics according to their behaviour under spatial inversion @xmath101 : a harmonic with index @xmath102 is even if it transforms as @xmath103 and odd if it transforms as @xmath104 . according to this classification , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107",

    "each perturbation is labelled by @xmath110 and the full perturbation is given by a sum over all @xmath102 and @xmath111 .",

    "@xmath142 we now consider the form of these equations for the background ltb spacetime .",
    "to proceed further , we must find a relation between the gauge invariant matter perturbation terms ( [ tabdef ] - [ tscaldef ] ) and the dust density and velocity discussed in section 2.1 .",

    "so far , we have established the behaviour of @xmath4 as it approaches the cauchy horizon .",

    ", we will use the coordinate system @xmath818 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the in- and outgoing null coordinates ( see ( [ uvcoords ] ) for their definitions ) , rather than @xmath819 coordinates .",
    "this is a useful choice of coordinate system to make when considering the perturbed weyl scalars .",
    "we follow throughout the presentation of @xcite .    for the even parity perturbations , only two of the perturbed weyl scalars , @xmath820 and @xmath821 , are identification and tetrad gauge invariant ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this means that if we make a change of null tetrad , or a change of our background coordinate system , we will find that these terms are invariant under such changes .",
    "we note that @xmath820 and @xmath821 represent transverse gravitational waves propagating radially inwards and outwards.these terms are given by @xmath822 where @xmath171 and @xmath823 are angular coefficients depending on the other vectors in the null tetrad , and on the basis constructed from the spherical harmonics .",
    "the ingoing and outgoing null vectors @xmath824 and @xmath825 are given in ( [ inoutvectors ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath826 is also invariant under spin - boosts , and therefore has a physically meaningful magnitude @xcite .",
    "[ thm12 ] the perturbed weyl scalars @xmath820 and @xmath821 , as well as the scalar @xmath827 , diverge on the cauchy horizon .",
    "we begin by writing the tensor @xmath131 in @xmath828 coordinates as @xmath829 the condition that @xmath131 be tracefree results in @xmath830 . in @xmath828",

    "if we retrace our steps through the first order reduction in section [ sec : reduction ] , we find that @xmath288 contributes to @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath841 and its first derivatives .",

    "we have considered here the behaviour of even parity perturbations of the self - similar ltb spacetime in the case where there is a naked singularity . in particular , we have examined their evolution in the approach to the cauchy horizon associated with the naked singularity .",
    "we first identified the fundamental system of pdes which govern the evolution of the even parity perturbations but chose to use the five dimensional system in preference , as its symmetric hyperbolicity is a very useful property .",
    "we next considered an averaged form of the perturbation variable and showed that it displayed a generic divergence in its @xmath349-norm .",
    "the divergence occurs for all angular number @xmath102 . here",
    "the term generic refers to the fact that the divergence occurs when solutions evolve from a set of initial data which is open and dense in the set of all initial data .",
    "this result is not by itself sufficient to ensure that the perturbation diverges on the cauchy horizon , as it is perfectly possible for a pointwise finite function to have a diverging @xmath349-norm .",
    "however , this result gave us a useful ansatz for investigating the asymptotic behaviour of the solution itself in the approach to the cauchy horizon .",
    "to determine the pointwise behaviour of the perturbation in the approach to the cauchy horizon , we introduced a scaled version of the state vector , @xmath813 .",
    "we used a series of energy methods which produced bounds on @xmath6 and its @xmath319-derivatives in the approach to the cauchy horizon . by combining these results with the formal solutions for @xmath6 arising from the method of characteristics",

    "finally , this allowed us to establish a theorem which demonstrated that @xmath6 is non - zero on the cauchy horizon over some interval .",
    "this result pertains for all angular numbers @xmath102 .",
    "iguchi , harada and nakao @xcite studied the behaviour of the quadrupole mode ( @xmath852 ) of the even parity perturbations of the ltb spacetime .",
    "they numerically solved the linearised einstein equations and found that this perturbation diverged on the cauchy horizon .",
    "in one sense , our results are a generalization of theirs , in that this method allows us to treat all perturbations .",
    "however , the extra symmetry of self - similarity is needed in order to apply our methods .",
    "we note a potential issue with this work .",
    "our perturbations are at linear order .",
    "it follows that it is somewhat strange to conclude that they diverge on the cauchy horizon , as they are therefore far too large to remain at linear order .",
    "however , this result still indicates that this spacetime is not stable to perturbation .    in previous work",
    ", we demonstrated that the odd parity perturbations of this background spacetime are finite for all @xmath102 , where finiteness was measured with respect to initial values of a natural energy norm for the odd parity system .",
    "taken as a whole , this work supports the hypothesis of cosmic censorship , in that one should expect perturbations on a naked singularity spacetime to diverge as the cauchy horizon is approached .",
    "the background spacetime investigated here is of course not a serious model of gravitational collapse , as at the very least , it ignores the effects of pressure during the collapse .",
    "a natural extension of this work would therefore be to consider the self - similar perfect fluid model , which contains a naked singularity for a wide range of the equation of state parameter .",
    "the study of the behaviour of perturbations in this spacetime would be a very interesting application of the methods developed here .",
    "we thank carsten gundlach for helpful discussions .",

    "we list here the various matrix coefficients and source terms omitted in sections [ sec : reduction ] , [ sec : lqblowup ] and [ sec : chdivbehaviour ] .",
    "we neglect to list those terms whose exact form is not important .",

    "finally , we present the similarity matrix @xmath203 ( which appears in section [ xbehaviour ] and is used in the proof of theorem [ thm4 ] ) , a constant matrix which transforms the zero order term of the taylor expansion of @xmath256 , @xmath871 , into @xmath535 .",
    "it is given by @xmath872 where @xmath873",
    "in the statement of theorem [ thm2 ] , we looked that the jordan canonical form of the zero order term in the taylor expansion of the matrix @xmath256 .",
    "we claimed that the only non - zero eigenvalue of this matrix was in the range @xmath874 , for @xmath875 .",
    "here we prove this claim .",
    "in the previous section , we presented the coefficients of the equation of motion for @xmath4 .",
    "recall that the coefficient of @xmath4 was given as @xmath266 , where in terms of the notation of ( [ 5dsys ] ) , @xmath876 . after we put @xmath266 in jordan canonical form , we find that the only non - zero term is the @xmath579 entry , which is given by @xmath877 now define @xmath878 . on the cauchy horizon , @xmath879 by definition .",
    "we can use this to taylor expand the numerator of ( [ cdef ] ) and to simplify the zero order term .",
    "we can also taylor expand the factor of @xmath263 which appears in the denominator so that @xmath880 . inserting these expansions into ( [ cdef ] )",
    "produces @xmath881 as @xmath882 .",
    "so we must determine the value of @xmath883 , where we use ( [ sdef ] ) to prove the last equality and we write @xmath884 to emphasise that the location of the cauchy horizon depends on the value of @xmath363 , the nakedness parameter .",
    "we first analyse how @xmath885 depends on @xmath363 , before using this information to determine the behaviour of @xmath886 .",
    "we define @xmath887 , so that @xmath888 .",
    "the cauchy horizon corresponds to the first negative root of the quartic equation @xmath889 .",

    "we know that a root exists for @xmath875 , where @xmath892 corresponds to a double root of @xmath28 , where @xmath893 .",
    "let @xmath894 .",
    "we can easily show ( using @xmath895 ) that @xmath896 which implies that @xmath897 satisfies the quadratic @xmath898 by solving this for @xmath897 and picking the larger root , we have @xmath899 next ,",
    "we consider the dependence of @xmath885 on @xmath363 .",
    "if we differentiate the condition @xmath29 with respect to @xmath363 , multiply by @xmath900 and use @xmath29 to simplify , we find that @xmath901 we note that the coefficient of @xmath902 vanishes at @xmath892 ( see [ astardef ] ) and is positive in the interval @xmath875 ( we can see this by calculating its roots and noting that for the range of allowable @xmath363 , we are always above the larger root ) . now since @xmath903 , this implies that @xmath904 for all @xmath875 and @xmath905 so to summarise , we know that @xmath906 ( see the definition of @xmath28 ) , @xmath907 and @xmath885 is monotonically decreasing from @xmath908 down to @xmath909 as @xmath363 increases from @xmath910 to @xmath61 .",
